        "text": "So before I say anything about the book, which I have not completed yet, I first want to say this:\n\nIt is quite amazing to me the way that certain literatures will hold no relevance in one's mind until it absolutely needs to, and the way that certain lessons simply cannot be learned until one has lived the appropriate experiences in their own life. I have read 100-150 pages of Eden before about 2-3 years ago, but it was mindless reading and I didn't retain much of it at all. This time around, however, I am devouring every word with such care and admiration for the delicate way he details the shortcomings of the human psyche, and of human morality, and I just.... I am in love.\n\nI have long touted John Steinbeck as my favorite author ever since reading \"Of Mice and Men\" in high school, and even though the only other work of his I have read beginning to end is \"Travels with Charley in Search of America.\" there is just something about his characterization that resounds with me, and, having read the first three chapters of \"Eden\" I think I can safely say that it is the impeccable way in which Steinbeck brings beauty, and innocence even, to the most monstrous of events and people. Combined with the heart breaking irony of Alice's misconception about the gifts being left around for her, and Adam's stubborn affection for Charles, I find it impossible to place any author I've ever read above him. Not to mention the beautiful and endearing way he paints such a vivid picture of the Salinas Valley, and details the history of the land. It gives me a whole new appreciation for the time I spent living in California just a few short hours away from his home. I am so excited to continue this beautiful piece of art, this time to completion, and finally explore more of his writing. ",

        "author": "Tom_The_Human",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/8hwr3f/spoilers_womens_rights_and_social_change_in_a/",
        "text": "Hey guys. I recently resolved to understand the media I consume more. To achieve this, I decided to start to write essays about things that I watch or read. I just finished reading Ishiguro's A Pale View of Hills yesterday and decided to make it my first subject. This is the first analysis of a novel I have written in the best part of a decade (and my previous attempts, if I'm honest, were pretty much just my teacher spoon-feeding me an analysis of To Kill A Mockingbird). As a result, I am open to all constructive feedback regarding my writing.\n\nIf you have any other thoughts on this book, I would love to hear them.\n\nAlso spoilers, obviously.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAfter the country’s defeat in the Second World War, Japan was occupied by the United States and its society began to change. The country experienced a shift away from its traditional values towards a more Western ideal. It is during this shift that A Pale View of Hills takes place. Through its characters, it shows the varying reactions of various characters – conservative and liberal alike. The focus of the book is largely on the oppression of women in traditional Japanese society – and I shall dedicated a large part of this essay to discussing its portrayal. However, the book also exists on a statement (and possibly a personal reflection on behalf of Ishiguro) on the role of culture in forming our personalities and perceptions of the world.\n\nA Pale View of Hills suggests that the role of women in pre-war Japanese society was of servants to their husbands. They were not expected to have an identity of their own in the context of their family. Instead, they were expected to behave in accordance with their husband’s desires and living for their family, rather than for themselves. The view of women as servants is evident in Etsuko’s role in the discussions of Jiro and Ogata. Whilst Ogata and Jiro converse, Etsuko has minimal input and seems to exist mostly to serve food and tea, and prepare Jiro’s clothes. This is not the only instance of women serving men. In a conversation with Etsuko, Sachiko recalls how she, her cousin, and the housemaid would take it in turns to cook – yet she never mentions her uncle doing so.\n\nEtsuko’s role during Ogata and Jiro’s conversations also shows the lack of women’s individuality inside their families. This is because whilst her husband and father-in-law converse she rarely plays an active part in the conversation – simply listening instead. Furthermore, it is seen as her duty to reflect her husband’s opinions in public. This is further shown when Jiro’s co-workers visit. Upon discovering that his wife intended to vote for a different political party, Jiro’s co-worker attempted to intimidate her into voting for his party. The fact that Jiro and Ogata then both agree that “husband and wife voting for different parties [is a] sad state of affairs” implies that Etsuko is expected to mirror Jiro’s views in public.\n\nAdditionally, A Pale View of Hills suggests that a woman’s identity is her family. This is shown throughout the book. The most constant way in which it is shown is through Etsuko’s activities. Throughout her time in Nagasaki, Etsuko was at home whilst Jiro worked long hours. This was not so much of a problem during the story as she had Ogata and Sachiko for company. However, both of them were merely there on a temporarily – with both leaving at the end of the book. Her future could be seen through Sachiko’s life with her uncle. The three women of Sachiko’s uncle’s household spent their lives tethered to the household – with boredom leading them to fight over who cooks. Sachiko later stated that she had nothing left at her uncle’s house other than “a few empty rooms” and the prospect of sitting there and growing old. This is compounded by the revelations of Sachiko’s cousin, who admits that she hasn’t visited town “since last spring”, presumably (in part) as her father is “too ill to leave the house.” Here we can see the expectation for women to simply stay at home instead of engaging with hobbies or friends – despite the fact that all that awaits them as boredom.\n\nThis expectation can also be seen in Mrs Fujiwara’s actions – or, perhaps more accurately, in Ogata’s reaction to her subverting society’s expectations of her. After losing her husband and all but one of her sons in the war, she decided to move on by setting up a noodle shop. Ogata considers this a “step down” as her husband commanded great respect – much more so than a noodle shop owner. The reason why he considers this a step down is because her status was seen as equal to that of her husband whilst he was alive – suggesting that her status mirrors that of her husband’s, rather than being the result of her own hard work. Indeed, Ogata regards her “circumstances” as pitiful rather than commending her for moving on and enjoying her laugh. The implication is that, from Ogata’s point of view, her status as an active participant in life effectively ended with her husband’s demise.\n\nThe Japan which A Pale View of Hills is one in which women have no individuality. The life of a woman is tied to her family. Her only activities are activities which serve her family. Her only successes are the successes of her family. Her opinions are those of the head of the family – her husband. Women are granted no agency. It is little wonder that Sachiko was so desperate to escape. She dreamed of her daughter becoming a business woman or a painter. She dreamed of her daughter having the agency to choose a life which she wanted.\n\nBefore Mariko could be free, Sachiko needed to find a way out of Japan. She saw an opportunity to do so in Frank, and thus pursued him. However, Frank took advantage of this. By promising to take her to America, Frank uses Sachiko (presumably) for sex. It is then found out that she is not the only woman he’s seeing, and Sachiko breaks it off with him. Finally, Frank gets her to come to Kobe with him when he moves there for work. He will be working on a cargo ship and told her he’ll leave for America to find a job before paying for her to come with him. It does not say what happens but, judging by his history, the assumption is that he is using her again. This implies that, whilst women in Japan may be oppressed, Western men are hardly all benevolent. Another implication of this is that there is merit in the Japanese view of dating as it protects the woman from manipulation. This is because dating in Japan traditionally happened after couples announced their engagement – casual dating only became widespread during and after the American occupation.\n\nHowever, additional security during courtship can hardly be described as a huge advantage when the secure courtship can lead to a life of misery. Niki and her friends agree with this assessment when they laud Etsuko for her decision to lead Japan. Instead of graciously receiving their praise, Etsuko gives her daughter a sarcastic response. This is not the only time she is defensive regarding Japan. Whilst her second husband considered Jiro to be “oafish”, Etsuko defends him by claiming that her husband never understood Japanese culture, and that husband and wife have separate duties in Japanese culture. Nevertheless, these duties seem to restrict the lives of women much more than those of men. So why is Etsuko so defensive regarding Jiro and Japanese culture?\n\nThe reason for this is that Etsuko is still attached to her culture. This is not the only instance which shows that she still has an attachment to it. Twice – at the beginning and end of the book – she asks Niki about getting married and having kids (much to Niki’s chagrin). She also expresses surprise over one of Niki’s friends having a child out of wedlock at 19. This is all despite the fact that Etsuko is repeatedly shown to be liberal (compared to traditional Japanese values) in her conversations with Niki.\n\nShe is also not the only character which struggles with social change. The most obvious character which struggles against social change is Ogata – who perhaps serves the embodiment of Japanese conservatism. In his role as a head teacher before the Second World War, Ogata was a strict disciplinarian and even made the children frightened. Despite previously admiring him, Shigeo (amidst the post-war social change) begins to see the faults in Ogata’s teaching methods and publically chastises him (angering him in the process). Ogata also refused to denounce Japanese Imperialism in his conversation with Shigeo, and denounces technological innovations such as washing machines. Finally, as previously mentioned, he pities Mrs Fujiwara despite her moving on with her life.\n\nThe ways in which Sachiko struggles against social change, on the other hand, are slightly more nuanced than Ogata. Whilst she openly laments the lack of opportunity for women in Japan, she still seems to only desire to live through her family. We can see this through her pedestalisation of America as a land where her daughter can achieve her dreams – not where she herself can achieve them. In addition, even while she’s in Japan there is little focus on her working. Whilst she does get a job working for Mrs Fujiwara at the start, she does not work there for long. Even after her plan falls through with Frank, she decides that it would be better to go back to live a life of misery with her uncle than to work under the relatively progressive Mrs Fujiwara. She is content for her family to be her identity. Finally, this is not the only way in which she is attached to Japanese culture. After her plan to go to America fails, instead of admitting her mistake to Etsuko she decides to save face. This is relevant as saving face was and still is considered important in Japanese culture.\n\nWe can also see the hybrid nature of 1950s Japanese society in two of the supporting characters – Shigeo and Mrs Fujiwara. Whilst Shigeo is depicted as having radical and anti-authoritarian political views, he still adheres to Japanese social norms by inviting Ogata in for tea when he is confronted by him. Likewise, Mrs Fujiwara also upholds Japanese social norms by bowing excessively to customers, despite betraying other norms by owning her noodle shop.\n\nIt is also important to understand how the children respond to social change. Mariko and Keiko were both born in Japan and are resistant to leaving it. Whilst Mariko’s reasoning is due to Frank being “a pig”, we do not know why Keiko did not want to leave. However, we can see that she felt isolated in this new culture due to her reclusive tendencies. This sense of isolation was so severe that she eventually took her own life. Niki, on the other hand, was not born in Japan, and only experienced Japanese culture through her mother and reclusive half-sister. As a result of this, Niki is the most Westernised of all the named characters.\n\nSo what can we take from all of this?\n\nA Pale View of Hills is a statement on the impact that our cultural upbringing has on our personalities, and that cultural evolution is a long process. Whilst the more progressive characters may extol Western values, they are all (barring Niki) still inextricably Japanese. The reason for this is because they were raised in a society with Japanese values. However, that does not mean to say that their values cannot change at all. Whilst Etsuko and Sachiko maintain somewhat conservative ideals in some aspects, they are both relatively liberal in other aspects (as seen by Sachiko wanting Mariko to have an identity of her own and Etsuko accepting the choices of Niki and her friends despite them seeming outlandish to her).\n\nOn the other hand, Niki seems to have no semblance of Japanese culture in her personality. This is a result of her being raised in the West – removed from traditional Japanese culture. One implication of this is that the children of others who emigrated to the West would also embody Western values. Another is that those who remained in Japan would also come to embrace Western values. This is a result of the changes that Japanese society was undergoing in the period in which the book was written. These changes would manifest much slower than in the children of emigrants, but they still would do so.\n\nThe book also suggests that Western society (and therefore the society which Japan is morphing into) also has problems. This is evident in Frank’s treatment of Sachiko, but also somewhat present in Etsuko’s second husband. Whilst Etsuko herself admits that she did not particularly like Jiro, she does not like her husband criticising him as it is a symptom of him misunderstanding Japanese culture. Jiro was simply a product of the Japanese culture which shaped many of the characters – not its progenitor. It is quite possible that, had he been born in Japan, Etsuko’s husband would have been a man like Jiro. Therefore, the book argues that whilst cultures may have negative aspects, to condemn or condescend to those who were raised in it just for having been so is hubris.\n\nThe book may also serve as a meditation of Ishiguro’s own life. Like many of the Japanese characters, he was born in Nagasaki – moving to Britain at the age of 5. It is possible that it is a statement of his own feelings of cultural isolation and nostalgia from Japan, as well as dealing with the misconceptions of people around him in Britain in the 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s. It is also possible that Ishiguro feels the same cultural divide with his parents as Niki did with her mother, and Keiko with Etsuko’s second husband.\n\nIn conclusion, A Pale View of Hills shows us that we are all products of our culture. We embody both the positive and negative aspects of it. However, that is not to say that we cannot change our societies for the better – it just takes time.\n",
