        "text": "As someone who suffers from depression and social anxiety, I often find myself damaging the relationships I have with both close friends and partners, but especially those who I've dated, mainly because of the insecurities that stem from these issues. The fear of being alone and the craving for emotional intimacy makes it incredibly difficult to walk away from potentially toxic people and situations, yet the complete lack of self-esteem and fear of being rejected leads to self-isolation from the people closest to you so that you can protect yourself from harm. \n\nNow, I may just be projecting my own issues onto the larger community, but from what I have read on similar askreddit threads about toxic and abusive relationships, every single one that involves gaslighting, emotional abuse, etc. is supposedly caused by a partner with a documented mentall illness that they're struggling with. And I've had several romantic relationships fail in the past at least partly because of issues caused by my SO's anxiety, or depression, or OCD. Should people like us even bother to pursue relationships until we get our mental health under control (which is never guaranteed in any way), knowing that anything we pursue is doomed to fail because we're simply physically incapable of currently having the mental and emotional capability required for dating someone? If we hate ourselves, how can we love someone who loves us?",

Even if this particular group shares a home life together and spends time talking, eating, etc.\n\nYet the college lifestyle doesn't seem to offer that much more from a materialistic perspective. I'm not looking at the academic/learning aspect, which is wonderful, but the home life aspect. Is living in a room without your own shower, TV, maybe no air conditioning, and eating instant ramen and hot pockets that much more enjoyable from a home life perspective? \n",

However, you see the nazi supporter take a step back and put his hands up in a clear sign that he did not want to fight, and was immediately punched in the face.\n\nHalf of the comments section says that showing violence towards someone who supports genocide, murder, and oppression of innocent people is acceptable. Even though the man hasn't killed or attacked anyone, by supporting some of the most terrible acts of violence in history he is guilty and considered dangerous by association.\n\nOthers say that regardless of his political beliefs or what he says, he should not have been touched unless in self-defense and he clearly was not being physically aggressive. \n\nThoughts? How do you feel about violence towards people who haven't carried out violence themselves but support and encourage the use of it against other people?",

Some responses even apologized for being assertive.\n\n**Another example:** A friend that can't let go of the idea that they are inconveniencing you--to the point that even a small effort to lend them a hand or say a kind word is met with overwhelming gratitude that lasts not just hours, but days and weeks after the fact. You feel so overwhelmed by the magnitude of their reaction to what you believed was such a small act of kindness that you have trouble reconciling how this person seems to feel about your character or decency as a person, and what that says about you in general.\n\n**Yet another example:** Someone who can't stop apologizing, even for things for which it's blatantly obvious was in no way their fault. You quickly feel like it's wasted energy to try to explain how glaringly obvious it is that it's not their fault every time--especially because they will fight you on it, and make you try twice as hard to convince them. You instead start to wonder if you've not been taking enough blame in situations where you previously thought it was clear that you had no fault.",
