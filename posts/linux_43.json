I am the lone IT person for my location and currently we do not have a good software we are using for remote support. I have been having to use teams and a variation of other free tools that dont always work how I need them (mainly admin rights issues). If possible I would like to use Linux and create a server for this, the caveat here is we are a Windows environment so the machines I would be supporting are windows. I honestly feel kind of directionless so would need some idea as to what OS maybe I should use as well as what software's in the Linux environment would work for what I am trying to accomplish. Also as a side note   what is the most common Linux discord people use for questions and discussions? Seen some listed but wasn't sure which to use.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any answers given and thanks to all!",

Google hasn't yielded any fixes. \n\nI'm gonna ramble on here because my first post got deleted by auto mods for being too short. Nice to meet you all. I'm new to linux. I used a version on a raspberry pi and thought it was pretty cool but it didn't have enough ram so it really sucked. I would maybe get a pi with more ram and try it again because i think the application is super cool and the ability to have a tiny ass desktop is just mind blowing. Ramble ramble ramble ramble.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been using grapheneOS for over a year now and it is simply amazing.\n\nI was wondering if anything similar in terms of features was available on the desktop. The features that I find the most important are :\n- sandboxing of all apps by default\n- the easiness of managing permissions for every app installed (especially storage scopes and network)\n- the easiness of managing processes running in the background\n- mac address randomization everytime it is connected to a new AP\n\nA lot of things are possible with linux on a desktop, but I feel like it is also important for it to be available to people that don't understand everything tech related. GrapheneOS is very good at privacy by default and gives control for the ones who want it.\n\nPlease tell me if such a project exists, even if it is at an early developpement state !",

        "text": "hi pals,  \ni have a strange question and, I have an old Compaq presario CQ60 amd athlon dual core 1.90 laptop with 3 gb ram and 250gb hdd and I wanted to be able to use it for internet classes, I will use google drive suite nothing else and I asked myself, what OS do you think I could install it? linux or a windows? I would like a linux but I would like it to be an easy to use one that has a lot of graphical environment and less console or terminal since it will be to give it to someone who needs it to run their virtual classes and has no knowledge of linux commands and so on... I thought an ubuntu like version 15 or 18 something so it doesn't use a lot of memory and it's a bit simple to use but I don't know what you could recommend me  \nThank you",

First, as the community gets bigger, there is bound to be more corporate involvement, and im afraid that eventually linux would turn into the proprietary garbage windows and mac have. Second, as it gets bigger, there will be kore security issues discovered and exploited. Third, the linux community is tight knit and i dont want it to become like the alternatives without any community.",

        "text": "# Why this post:\n\nI have been searching high and low, for a good 10 months, with no answers. I bought this laptop to use it to its fullest, and am using linux. I was very close to scrapping everything and going back to windows, forgoing all my previous comforts and customization. Hence, this post would hopefully serve as **a stopping point to fellow Linux users googling this issue,** so that we all can happily use our favourite linux Distro without any qualms, while making full use of the hardware we aquired. Touchscreen folding laptop is such a gamechanger in Uni, and Linux provides an unlimited potential and ease of use and customisation. I wish Linux got not just Laptop support, but more support with current existing hardware.\n\n# What this is NOT: \n\n* How to rotate screen\n* How to disable rotation\n* How to calibrate / screen matrix / configure touchscreen when screen rotates\n\nthese are all handled by most major Desktop Environments (like Gnome). For those doing their own Tiling Window Managers (i3wm, xmonad, qtile, etc...)  there are lots of (usually python) scripts available online that can be run at startup\n\n# What this IS:\n\nThere is a problem where for linux-based systems, whenever the screen is turned / flipped, the WiFi and Bluetooth are both killed. Consulting RFKill shows that both Bluetooth and WiFi have been **hardware blocked**. Those with a mature desktop environment will receive a notification that **Airplane mode is tuned on**. If you skim through `journalctl`, you can see RFKILL documenting the hardware radio kill switch being triggered and the WiFi being turned off. \n\nBut there is no physical airplane mode / wifi kill switch!\n\nOf course, one can simply `rfkill unblock all` but sometimes you want to intentionally kill your radio. A simple solution is to disable the trigger altogether. [This same issue has been discussed here](https://forum.garudalinux.org/t/flipping-or-folding-2-in-1-laptop-disables-bluetooth-and-wifi/17545/11) but without any satisfactory solutions. However, an important point brought up was that when the **accelerometer detects change in orientation, an event is triggered**. What this event is, I don't know. Unfortunately, xev or any keypress detection commands fail to pick up any key events, or what the event even represents\n\nHowever, I figured the issue, and a possible explanation:\n\n* Accelerometer orientation is triggering hardware-keysym events \n* Hardware keysym allows keyboard, touchpad and keyboard lights to be disabled when folded\n* Due to some masking event or oversight or bug, XF86RFKILL key is being pressed - this is the **\"Airplane mode\" key** or the \"hardware killswitch\" (mapped to key 255 / 0xFF)\n\n# Solution:\n\nFollowing [https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/577826/how-to-prevent-xf86rfkill-keypress-from-enabling-linuxs-airplane-mode](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/577826/how-to-prevent-xf86rfkill-keypress-from-enabling-linuxs-airplane-mode),\n\nDisable XF86RFKILL (Keycode 255) with your preferred choice. Mine is:\n\n`xmodmap -e 'keycode 255='`\n\nOnce done, check with `xmodmap -pke` and the last line will be:  \n`keycode 255 =`\n\nIf it still shows something like `XF86RFKill NoSymbol XF86RFKill`, then you might need to check your command again or find another way of running this.\n\nUnfortunately, this requires your X service to be running, so I am not sure that the wayland alternative is, and for ubuntu gnome, this does not work if you add it to the startup or `~/.Xmodmap` file or add as a service to `systemctl`. What I do is just add it to my `.zshrc` (or `.bashrc`) and autolaunch my terminal emulator at startup. It's idempotent in that after the first time, subsequent times have no real effect, maybe other than having to run one more command.",
