        "text": "My current gas bill is $390. This is absolutely absurd as I’m used to it being $90 at the highest when I lived in other parts of California. . I recently moved to a mountain town in the Sierra Nevada mountains located in California, this is my first winter up here so maybe I’m not doing something right. It’s in the 30’s here and gets down to single digits at night so the heater is always going. \nIt’s my understanding that natural gas prices have increased in California this year, but nearly $400? That’s a sick joke. \n\nI had the gas company come over and check for leaks, he sealed all the valves, checked the ducts, and turned down my water heater. \n\nWhat are some ways you lower your gas bills? Any tips or suggestions are welcome.",

        "text": "Hey all, this is my first time living in a house on my own (i've previously lived in student housing) and I have a question about my utility bill. \n\nMy fiancé and I live in a small 800sqft house in an extremely rural part of Oklahoma. We have 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, and the only appliances we have are a stove and a fridge. We wash our dishes in the sink and go to the laundromat for laundry. We're conservative with our energy and water: not taking too long showers, turning off all the lights before we leave, unplugging small appliances when we aren't using them, and keep the ac/heat at a reasonable temperature. Over the year we've been here, our utility bill including water and electric typically hovers somewhere in the $125-$225 range. I've seen it go as low as $75 and as high as $300 but never more or less. My dad lived in this house for 3 years before us and he says the same thing, even through extreme weather and price hikes. \n\nI got my utility bill this morning and it's a whopping $600!!! That's more than our mortgage!! We haven't made any changes to our lifestyle, bought new appliances, etc. So I'm wondering what the actual F happened to our bill?!? Any suggestions on what we should do to figure out what's going on?",

I can't even find thrift store jeans under $20 anymore since goodwill is off the rails with their pricing. Mercari and Poshmark are like thrift store shopping but way easier. You can even make offers to people on their items if you don't like the price.\nOne time I favorited a pair of $35 shoes and the owner sent me a lower offer every day until I purchased them at $8. \n\nIf you're like me and know your brands and sizes definitely check it out.

I was debating the tesla model y long range or tesla model 3 performance. I could go cheaper and get their basic tesla model 3. There is that 7500 tax rebate and the car is cheaper than its ever been apparently. The discount ends in march so have time to decide. I don't need a new car the toyota car runs well but the car is my dads that he gave me while my dad drives crappier car. So I feel bad in a way.

        "text": "I planned a shopping trip weeks in advance for yesterday.  Some fun stuff that I actually really need, like bed sheets and storage tubs.  But as most of us frugalers know, shopping can be really hard and stressful!  It’s hard to part with the money we so desperately saved.  Even if we need something, there’s guilt in buying.  \n\nSo I vowed to have a fun day, and mentally prepared myself to not nickel and dime myself all day.  I set a singular limit on the day, but not on what fun I’d have with that money.  And one of the things that caught my eye yesterday, or rather my nostrils, was a coffee shop coffee.  You know, frugalers, we make and bring our own!  But it smelled so good and fresh, and I knew I’d enjoy the hell out of it while strolling the outdoor shopping district in the cold.  \n\nI haven’t been in a coffee shop in maybe 6 years?  It was a Dunks y’all.  Not even a nice shop.  It’s the blue collar, no frills, cup of Joe shop.  With reasonably priced fancier drinks now.  \n\nI ordered a large hot coffee with an espresso shot, and it was over $7!!  I purposely didn’t listen when she said it and just plugged my card in the machine, because remember, I’m trying to have fun right?  And not stress about money.  I planned for this, and I know I’m gonna enjoy the heck out of it.  \n\nIt only hit me as I left, and I burst out laughing at my golden cup of coffee.  I sure did enjoy the heck out of it, but I did think the entire time, “this is like 10 years worth of dishrags.  Or a decent new baking sheet.  Or even something I don’t need at all, since I technically didn’t need this coffee to survive.”  Marshalls has some cute dog sweaters on clearance that would’ve had me laughing at my baby for months!  \n\nI really had to get over the fact that I spent $10 (rounding up, then plus tip, and maybe a little self imposed guilt tax) on something intangible, that I’ll never see or enjoy again.  I laughed that a cup of coffee is an “experience” for me, while the coffee shop was filled with hurried and stressed commuters.  I was shocked that people spend that much on coffee daily.  Daily.  Whoa!  \n\nI came home $10 lighter with nothing to show for it, and I lived through it lol.  Through it was a struggle to accept my delicious decision.  Frugalers Guilt is real y’all!  \n\n(The Frugal Win here, since this post needed a tag: a $39 queen sized Down comforter stuffed in a corner of the clearance section, marked down because it had a 3” square with some sort of red “stuff” on it.  Which was powdery and light and came off with a damp cloth lol.  But even if it didn’t, I use a duvet cover lol!)",

I actually searched this subreddit before I decided to post this, in hopes that someone has brought this up before. I didn't find anything. \n\nMy father died, unexpectedly Oct 2021. His little sister has continually told my mother she needs a will, otherwise, her home, which she owns, will go to the state until I can prove it was left to me. I'm an only child and both my mother and I don't want this to happen. My mother just turned 71. I know she has at least ten years, unless something horrible happens to her. But the thought of family heirlooms, possibly being lost, because of a lack of will, scares me. \n\nIn addition, my husband's cousin, who is only a couple years older than him, has had several heart attacks in the past couple years. This got my husband thinking he needs a will (he's eleven years older than me). With he genes, he said sometimes he feels like a ticking time tomb.\n\n\nIn the 90's my grandparents got a special, \"two for one\" cremation! It was around $800. There was also a will. So when they died, it was already paid for. Items they had were given to their specified child.\n\n When my dad died, all I knew for certain was where he wanted to be scattered. I paid the $1200 for cremation. We weren't sure about a funeral. My mom didn't want it so we didn't have it. And there's an ongoing feud between my dad's little brother and my mother about a collection of items my dad promised my uncle. \n\n\nIf you think about it, no one is guaranteed tomorrow. So maybe we should all be doing this. When everything is planned out, and even paid for, by a relative, it is so much easier on the living\n\nWith that being said, I know some of you frugal people on here have done this. How did you do it at a low cost, or even free? There's SO much information I don't even know where to begin.",

The leather is so soft and supple: I was really surprised how different cream is. Also, I thrifted these for like $5, so I've never seen them looking as nice as they do now!",

I'm usually in one place 3 days and the other 4.\n\nPreviously I was working from home, and got spoiled by meal prepping or taking multiple hours to throw together something delicious, and my typical grocery list consists of all raw, uncooked, fresh foods. Now, I'm finding myself with **two** completely empty fridges, as I don't have time to shop or cook and don't want so buy raw chicken if I'm only at that spot for a few more hours.\n\nI *hate* the feeling of food waste– cooking 4 chicken breasts and suddenly 7 days have gone by and all four are untouched. But I'm used to shopping this way, and cooking everything from baseline.\n\nWhat are your go to fridge staples to throw ingredients together for meals after a long day when you know you won't be in that location much longer? Is it buying frozen veggies, precooked chicken? What tasty recipes do you like when you're split living!\n\nAlso, sorry to put a damper on things, but I'm lactose intolerant, so if your suggestion involves drenching something in cheese, I cannot indulge!! :(",

I've procrastinated on replacing my current one, and it's on its last legs- I'd be lucky if it lasts another week.\n\nI'm undecided if I should:\n\n\\- pay for a screen repair + a checkup on the phone's overall condition. I do like the phone and already bought a case for it, but I also read that these screen issues are relatively common w/ Pixel phones, and it's a gamble to trust that there won't be any other major issues. Also, the whole throwing good money at bad money thing (especially if there's still a chance I may actually get the refund, though idk how good Swappa is about that).\n\n\\- seek out another reputable reseller, so I can get a sturdy phone for around the same price\n\n\\- buy a budget smartphone, either through Mint (which I was gonna switch to anyway), an unlocked one from the T-Mobile in my neighborhood, etc. I've seen Samsung Galaxy A03, A32, etc, but I'm worried that they're built to last like a year. Like, apparently Google Pixel 4as aren't as sturdy as I thought, yet they're like $400 new. Is a new $150 phone vs a $900 really just a matter of branding and a few extra features? Also, I know if it's unlocked and not through Mint, I wouldn't be able to pay it in installments. I can afford to go above $200 upfront, but I'd really rather not. \n\nI apologize if these are any stupid questions...I was really looking forward to getting a good used phone and not contributing to more waste.

        "text": "Hi! My food budget is dropping to a little over $100 per month. I converted a van to live in so I can live within my means. The back was a kitchen with a stove and oven. Someone rear ended me and the kitchen portion is unusable for now. I do not have a microwave or other means of heating except boiling water I keep in a carafe each day. I could use any tips for staying within my food budget and what kind of meals to make that are economical. Most of my budget is on food stamps which do not allow hot food purchases. So most things I need to get will have to be cold. Thanks in advance!",
