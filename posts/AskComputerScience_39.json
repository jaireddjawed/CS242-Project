How did you handle NA values, categorical variables, and unbalanced data?\n2. Why did you choose this model or ML algorithm over other possibilities?\t\n3. What other algorithms did you try and why is your chosen one better than the others?\n4. How did you test your algorithm?\n\nCan anyone offer any feedback on my code? Thanks\n\nEDIT:\nMy answers to the questions were:\n\n1. I handled missing data by replacing NA values in numYO with median value of numYO. I noticed that “education” had “” instead of NA as its missing values. I deleted all the rows from the training set that contained “” for “education”.\nI used model.matrix to convert the categorical variables to dummy variables.\nFor the unbalanced data, because there were 4221 “no” values compared to just 526 “yes” values for the “answered” variable, I used oversampling to modify the training set so there were 4000 rows with “yes” and 4000 rows with “no” for the “answered” variable. \n\n2. The outcome variable is “answered”, which can only take on two values of “yes” and “no”. So this is a binary classification problem. Logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting can be used for binary classification problems. I could not use linear discriminant analysis because there is a mix of numerical and categorical variables\n\n3. I tried logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. Logistic regression got a better log-loss score for cross-validation than the other models. \n\n4. By leaving out 1/3 of the training set and using that as the validation set, and the remaining 2/3 of the training set for cross-validation.",

My primary major was Computer Science engineering, and I put down my secondary as \"Mathematics-Computer Science\" seeing as it was a BS and there were no other options. My admission turns out to be for \"Mathematics-Computer Science\", and all the sudden im all stressed. Dont get me wrong I am not shy to math, it is currently one of my favorite subjects. On the other hand though, I want Computer Science to be my main focus in college, and I want to spend as much academic time as I can programming.\n\nNow here is my question. Are any of you in a \"Mathematics-Computer\" science major, or even at UCSD yourself? How do the two majors compare? Should I be worried that mine is not \"engineering\"?\n\nI have researched both majors and they honestly seem pretty similar, however I'm just looking for personal anecdotes or opinions so I know to either go full steam ahead with the course or try to switch my major to \"Computer science engineering\"\n\nTl;dr\nAdmitted for \"mathematics-computer science\" wanted \"computer science engineering\" are the two really that different? Will my focus be steered away from raw computer science? ",

I want to continue to learn the hardware level stuff.\n\nI realize i'm pretty much still on chapter 1 here, but even still i'm having trouble figuring out where to go next.  I think, more specifically, i'm looking for an introductory text on Computer Architecture?  Instruction Set Architecture?  \n\nAgain, this is from the perspective of a complete layman.  I haven't even learned what a register does or is used for at this point.  I definitely want to familiarize myself with machine and assembly language to understand what happens after higher level languages are compiled.\n\nI know it will take a long, long time to do right, but that's okay.  If it matters I majored in mathematics so I already have a background in discrete math, linear algebra, etc.  \n\nNon textbook resources are okay too if you think they are extensive enough, or hardware to play with in conjunction with the book(s).\n\nThanks!",

So I took CSE after my high school.\n\n\n I like programming, solving programming problems, learning new technologies, building my own things after learning those technologies etc\nThe thing I like doing the most is learning more and more technologies of CS and applying these technologies. But CS is such a vast field that it is impossible to master everything so I want to learn and apply as much as I can.\n\nSo what I have decided is that I will earn money either by freelancing or by ads(by ads I mean by making websites/blogs or mobile apps or starting an educational Youtube Channel and showing ads on them) or by making softwares or games and selling them. I have decided to earn this way and not work under any company(freelancing is an exception because I will have a bit freedom of chosing my working hours) because by doing this I will spend time learning more and more new technologies and applying those technologies which is what I love doing.\n\n \nThis is the path I have chosen for myself. I request experienced people in the domain of CS to guide me to achieve my aim of learning and applying as many CS technologies as possible and also tell me how good this idea of mine is, and what are the drawbacks of following this path.\n\nEdit: As someone has mentioned that the goals which I've mentioned in my post are very generic I am adding a few things.\n\n\nTechnologies I am interested in: making Android, iOS apps, making simple 3D games using Unity 3D for Windows, Android and iOS platforms, Full Stack Web Development and Internet of Things.\n\nAs for now I am interested in learning these technologies and in the future I want to discover more technologies and learn them based on my interest.\n\n\nAbout my passion: I am passionate about learning more and more CS technologies.

I have a fairly good grasp of python, having completed 600x on Edx and worked through the Guttag textbook - introduction to Python. My question is to anyone who has experience with GSOC, or a good feel around college education. Is this something out of my depth, or would it be worth researching the over 200+ companies to find something that falls within my small area of abilities. I am also willing to put in a lot of effort between now and the various deadlines. ie, if I felt I had a shot, I would take one less general ed class next semester and use that time to acquire any skills I'd need for the Summer. Any advice is appreciated",

Working with computers and on computers is more stimulating for me so it would be obvious for me to work with them, as I can sit down and be stimulated while working on them.  Been using them since I was very young and into video games,  movie editing etc.  It's easy for me to learn things faster than regular people on the computer.  Anyhow,  Im considering Computer Science as it has more doors open for many jobs like developers, designers, video game designers coders and etc.  However I do not enjoy math a whole lot,  but I am decent at it.  Looking at the program,  it looks like its heavily math based?  Considering whether that will be a problem for me as I progress through it.  On the other hand looking at IT,  seems like it has no math relevant courses in the curricular.  I am good with algebra,  solving for x and things like that I feel is my strenght,  graphs not so much.  I do enjoy algebra more than graphing by alot.  But I am able to handle the math as its the same as anything need to put some time in but the curricular looks freighting.  Im not a A plus student in calculus.  Im more of a c+ c- type.  Anyways the math looks quite scary and just wondering if anyone who has similar math skills to me did CS and how did it play out for them? \nThe math courses requires me to take ritalin and stuff like that cause its so brutal for me.  Where as basic computer programming courses are do able with no meds.  Im thinking IT would be better for me, but feel capable of over acheiving by going with CS.  \n\nQuestions:\n-Anyone take CS who is not too math friendly?  how did it play out for you?\n-IT and CS courses are similar would I be able to switch to IT half way thru?\n-Bottom line im not a math genius more of a c,c+ calculus student, with alebgra as my strengths not so much graphs,  angles are good too.  would this be a problem in the future?\n\nPS:  The cs program I will be in summer is a total of 2 years,  then im planning to transfer to a university.  \n\nLet me know.

Experience that will help me in the future once I graduate will also be a huge plus. Right now, I feel like my main interests are software/app development, software engineering, or cyber security, although I haven't really spent any time actually doing any of those things or working with people who do, so that may be subject to change. Any idea what entry-level positions I can get that may provide me with some of this exposure/experience?  \n\nAlso, where should I start studying on my own? I've dabbled into a few programming languages such as Javascript and messed around with databases and SQL, but I am not sure where I should focus my efforts. I've also seen that there are a lot of certifications such as CompTIA and Microsoft certifications, but I'm not sure if they are the right thing for me right now? They seem to be more IT oriented, but I think I might be leaning a bit more towards CompSci than IT. Any other cool stuff I should be reading about or working towards while I wait for school to start?\nI appreciate whatever advice you have to offer, thank you.",

        "text": "So there's a clever algorithm that is constant in space and linear in time for finding the missing integer N if a single integer is missing 1..n (for example 6 is missing in 1,2,3,4,5,6).\n\nYou can try to find it, then I'll divulge below.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSo the thing is to keep an accumulator XOR'ing all the values, meanwhile you XOR in 1..n as well.  No matter what order your values, you'll end up with the single missing number.  (Since there is nothing on the other side to xor it out with.)\n\nOkay, so far, so good. As an exercise you can PROVE that this is optimal in space and time.  (It's easy: in space, your accumulator is a single number.  In time: you've gotta read them all at least once so it's still easy.)\n\nOkay, now I was wondering: how can you \"improve\" this to find TWO missing integers.  On the above algorithm, you will end up with their XOR, so you cannot know what they are.\n\nBut if you know for sure there will be 2 missing integers, how can you do it?  I was thinking, xor is a kind of checksum, maybe apply a second different type of checksum.  But I got stuck, I don't now what that might be.\n\nCan anyone come up with it and (optionally) prove it's optimal under the same constraints?  Thank you!",

        "text": "I am reading through [Schmidt's denotational semantics](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/text/DenSem-full-book.pdf) and while I'm beginning to understand that LFP Semantics for recursion gives you existence and uniqueness for recursive programs, I fail to see how the least fixed point of the induced functional *is* the desired program. For example at 6.6.1, the factorial function is shown in LFP semantics, but previously in 6.1, the graph of subfunctions of factorials is built up using the explicit recursive factorial function. I suppose I'm asking how can we show the LFP of the induced functional is the factorial function? It seems as if the text merely asserted the induced functional is the factorial, without really proving it.\n\nIn a glossy question, how is this actually important if there's no way to really specify that the graph of the LFP of induced Functionals *is* the graph of a desired function?",
