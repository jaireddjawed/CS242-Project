        "text": "i'm in my third year of engineering and i just realised i'm a highly creative thinker. This whole time i've spent trying to come up with my own solutions and some times i eventually get it, and some times i have to follow the process of whats it being taught and learn the details and try and solve it then. I feel like i've been doing this completely wrong and i should try and focus on my logical thinking and try and solve problems incrementally rather than trying to come up with a solution my self. \n\nheres the problem: my thinking leans more towards creative thinking and is weak on the logical side and i need to develop it, i'm just not too sure how. \n\nWhat can i do to develop the logical thinking.",

I'm unhappy with my job and feel stuck, so I decided I may want to switch fields.\n\nWhat should I do to get started with any Engineering job (ME, EE, CE, etc)? BS in an Engineering focus? Or MS in an engineering focus? I have a grad college that is willing to accept me as math major for an MS program, but I could also get a BS. \n\nWhat would yall recommend? Should I even backpedal that much?\n\nFor all who'd want to know, I don't like my job because it's a niche market, my job is mostly Word with no use of my analytical mind except how to apply the requirements gather (about 5% of my time), no one really talks casually (weird complaint but I like to be able to vent without feeling ill be snitched on), and there is very little support since the market is so niche.

The code produces a 10kHz carrier (PWM frequency) and 28Hz reference frequency (240RPM\\*14pole/120) with 3 phases and 120 degree phase difference between them. I used 3 channels and connected the main pwm channel modulated to the Hin part of the IR2110 and the CHxN to the Lin part (I applied this for 3 separate IR2110s.) On the oscilloscope, I saw the 10kHz carrier I wanted and the 120 degree sines with 28Hz reference.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe motor needs to be rotated by hand at the beginning. Apart from that, the motor continues to rotate at the speed I want. Another problem is that my motor draws currents like 4 amperes ( This is the current drawn from my power supply. I can't calculate the motor phase current since I don't have the hardware to measure the resistance in the motor phases ) and this is a bit too much for me (while rotating.) The motor I have is a 12V BLDC drone motor. If you want, I can share the code I wrote and the hardware I prepared with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your answers",

        "text": " \n\nI am a student who is still very new to developing sensorless FOC software. What I'm trying to do now is to open-loop control a BLDC motor using SPWM (to get theBEMF values ​​required for the close loop).\n\nI installed the necessary hardware for this and wrote the software for an STM32F407. The code produces a 10kHz carrier (PWM frequency) and 28Hz reference frequency (240RPM\\*14pole/120) with 3 phases and 120 degree phase difference between them. I used 3 channels and connected the main pwm channel modulated to the Hin part of the IR2110 and the CHxN to the Lin part (I applied this for 3 separate IR2110s.) On the oscilloscope, I saw the 10kHz carrier I wanted and the 120 degree sines with 28Hz reference.\n\nThe motor needs to be rotated by hand at the beginning. Apart from that, the motor continues to rotate at the speed I want. Another problem is that my motor draws currents like 4 amperes ( This is the current drawn from my power supply. I can't calculate the motor phase current since I don't have the hardware to measure the resistance in the motor phases ) and this is a bit too much for me (while rotating.) The motor I have is a 12V BLDC drone motor. If you want, I can share the code I wrote and the hardware I prepared with you.",

Recently, we had a major issue that caused production to stop.  Two senior engineers were discussing the issue, but they both were incorrect about why the issue occurred.  It was a pretty basic physics concept, so I was surprised to hear they had it wrong.  \n\nI attempted to let them know what I believed was correct, but they both said I was wrong. It made me question if I was correct or not, so I looked it up, and I was right.  I feel like the one engineer was getting mad that I questioned his expertise, so I didn't want to keep at it.  I know I didn't say it disrespectful , condescending, or anything like that.  \n\nWhat can I do or say in the future to address issues like this?   I don't want to come off as a know it all or anything like that, but I also don't want there to be more issues due to a minor error like that.",

There’s a lead engineer who tackles the important hardware and software issues of the existing product, while I help iterate the future designs working closely with the CEO.\n\nIn my most recent project, I’m designing packaging trays to hold multiple devices inside the shipping boxes, something I’ve done on a much larger scale in a previous position with another company. After a couple iterations, I came up with a really solid design that meets all of the requirements, and sent over the file to the CEO for approval. The CEO tweaked the constraints and insisted on making changes to the packaging that, given my 3 year background in a distribution center, would undoubtedly lead to damaged project in transit. I tried to pushback, even referencing the similar project I did for a company that’s currently worth 985 billion, but eventually gave in and just made the changes and sent the file to the CEO.\n\nIt felt like an ethical dilemma to be asked to design something I know will lead to failure and hardship for the company down the line. I still designed the part as asked, and I know the CEO will realize it’s a poor design once the damaged units start popping up, but I’d rather not waste the company’s time and money learning the hard way. In the future, how do I appropriately disagree/pushback on something like this?\n\nAt the end of the day I reached out to the lead engineer and asked for his input on the most recent iteration compared to my previous. I’m hoping he’ll see the risks and his opinion will convince the CEO to reconsider.\n\nTL;DR: How do I disagree with instructions that I know will result in a negative outcome for the company?",

I asked a lot of questions and it seems the job is legit to me, and I would learn a lot working on pretty interesting projects.

I have been feeling some terrible things lately and just wanted to see if there’s anyone in this community who has dealt with this before or can provide some guidance. So basically Im a 24 year old male who decided to go to college for electrical engineering when I was 18. I went to a decent school and got good enough grades to land me a decent job in the industrial controls field. The reasons I decided to be an engineer were pretty shitty. I wanted to prove to my family I was smart enough as they pretty much  always doubted me and I also wanted to have a decent, steady income and saw engineering as the perfect career to check both of those boxes. The only issue here is that I don’t think I’m cut out to be an engineer, I simply don’t care about some projects nor do I have the drive to become an expert in every field (necessary in controls). Due to me not caring sometimes I’ll make simple mistakes on drawings or HMI screens and sometimes these mistakes make me feel like I’m a moron who shouldn’t anywhere near engineering. I should also mention I’m married and my wife has gotten quite used to me making decent money and I am not sure if she would be ok with me making significantly less money by switching jobs/career which makes me feel stuck. Given all of this i am not sure where I want to take my career or how to make myself start caring and somehow develop drive to be better. Maybe I’m just really depressed i dont know. Rant over.",

They were talking as if he had attached a hose to the exhaust pipe of his 1967 Mustang and stuck the other end of the hose through the window.\n\nWhich doesn't make any sense to me. Anything that releases any significant amounts of carbon monoxide(while functioning normally) wouldn't be certified for indoors use.

        "text": "I did a few napkin math calculations and it seems the cost to build a thermoelectric generator to generate power from the temperature difference of the water in a PVT array and the water in a geothermal loop is comparable to if not slightly better than additional solar photovoltaic installations. If water from the solar array reaches 70C and the water from a geothermal loop is 12C, then that is a pretty large temperature difference to work with. The cooling power from a geothermal loop alone is 10kW or more, and the heat from the solar array is at least twice the power of the electricity it generates. I get TEGs are only 5-8% efficient, that means you could get around a 50% boost in power output from your PVT array. If you matched the excess heat output from a solar array to the unused cooling power of a geothermal loop, it seems like you could generate an additional kw or more during the day. Maybe you could get better performance and use a less powerful (cheaper) TEG by storing some of that excess heat from the day in a phase change material and use both the cooling power of the geothermal loop and the solar array (which at night functions as a giant radiator and a poor night sky cooler), for additional power during the night.\n\nWhat I'm having trouble with is spec'ing out the TEG or finding good units online (google keeps trying to suggest peltier chillers and gasoline generators). At least if you use a thermal battery, it seems like a good way to both cool the panels and have a source of electricity that can (at least partially) be generated during the night. Obviously that heat should first be used for space &amp; water heating needs, but it seems like a PVT array provides abundant heat.",

The house is two stories high and around 1500 sq. ft. with radiant heating, which I love, but it takes a long time to heat up a room or the entire house. When I go away for a week or so, I turn down the thermostats to the lowest (59°F) in each room. However, when I come back, it takes over a day for the whole house to warm up to even mid-60s to high-60s. Even if it's just me and I only want to heat up my bedroom and the living room, it still takes so long that I usually plug in an electric heater for 20 minutes to get the room warm before bed.\n\nWe recently installed Daikin split systems AC with hyper heat, and it works well to heat up the room very quickly when I return from a few days off. However, my question is, is this method more expensive? Of course, I can keep the thermostat at around 64°F and not make it higher when I get home, but I usually prefer the living room and bedroom to be around 68/69°F. I also don’t want to keep the radiant heat on 24/7 if I’m not here for three days, then stop by for one day, then leave for another week, and then come back to stay for a week. The boiler burns diesel for my hot water and radiant heating throughout the two stories. I'm looking into installing a smart thermostat or something similar to control it from my phone, but besides that, does anyone know how I can figure out which way is more energy-efficient or saves me more money? I can provide model numbers or any other necessary information if needed, but I'm mainly looking for a general answer. Thank you!\"",

I now design parts, smaller assemblies, fixtures, etc, while project engineers are in charge of the larger scale projects.\n\nLong story short, the drawing template the project engineers use was very basic and lacking critical information by default, and did not invoke any standard in the title block. I went through the process of neatening and expanding the template for our subsection of the business over a week period. I consulted machinists and the project engineers throughout, and am probably pedantic to a fault at times, and was given the green light for all of my changes at the end.\n\nRegarding standards: I know that predominantly ASME and ISO are the two major styles of drawing standards invoked. Since the changes I made I've \"sourced\" a lot of the most up to date ASME and AS (Australian ISO variant) standards, particularly ASME Y and B, and AS1100, to get a better understanding of what they entail and how they differ. From my understanding of what I've read and research thru eng forums, ASME seems to be more pedantic on drafting but can convey information regarding part fits more accurately. I also dislike the ISO method of general tolerance according to class instead of a singular UOS tolerance for general non-critical dimensions (and then actually providing a tolerance looser/tighter as required). It just seems messier, lazier and would require more thinking from the guys on the floor to follow.\n\nSo my question is, I would lean towards adopting ASME as an invoked drafting standard on our drawings and following it as closely as is reasonable. However, given my lack of engineering experience, could this potentially be an issue given Australia has it's own AS ISO standard? Is there anything I'm unaware of if I were to implement this change? \n\nFrom the drawings I see come from a variety of clients I still see lots of drawings that imply or invoke BS8888, some that invoke ASME Y14.5, some that invoke AS1100, etc, so I'm not sure if it necessarily matters as long as the intent is clear. Is there any reason I should utilise our own ISO other than the fact that it is simply Australian?",

However, for the past few months I have been assigned tasking far below what you would expect of this role - basically data remediation, as well as reading dense documentation about the engineering management system that did not amount to any tangible project outcomes. \n\nI am concerned about my development as an engineer in this company and have tried reaching out to my technical lead, and to some extent my manager about the lack of relevant tasking. The lack of any real response I've received over the past few months gives me the impression that I have been asking for too much. \n\nIs this experience to be expected at a large defence company? Should I have been more vocal about my concerns, or am I expected to just put my head down and do the work that needs to be done, regardless of how it may impact my technical development?",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI've been making some research recently into superheated steam and I came across something interesting: production of a Ultra Superheated Steam (USS) by using combustion. Here's the quote from the paper:\n\n\n&gt;&gt;In contrast to the abovementioned studies which investigated small steam additions to flames, Ultra-Superheated Steam (USS) uses steam as the bulk material in the flame in place of nitrogen in a typical fuel-air mixture. \n\n\n&gt;&gt;A method for producing USS was patented by F. M. Lewis and involves mixing water vapour or steam with oxygen in a ratio between 15-60%vol oxygen. This mixture is used to combust a fuel gas or oil in a high turbulence burner at a near stoichiometric fuel-oxygen mixture, to yield a gas mixture which is predominantly water vapour and carbon dioxide (Lewis, 2007). The omission of nitrogen from the oxidant means no energy is wasted in raising inert species up to high temperature, leaving more energy available for heating the steam.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;The adiabatic flame temperature of USS is considered to range between 1316-2760°C ignoring the energy conversion associated with free radicals formation (Lewis, 2007). The USS flame is clear and colourless, which is characteristic of the production of relatively high quantities of dissociation products such as high energy radicals.\n\n\nIs it supposed to work similarly to a gas turbine? Has it ever been actually tested? And lastly, in theory - would the efficiency of this system be proportionally higher to the rise of the temperature of the steam used? \n\n\nThe paper is called \"Gasification of Coal and Biomass Char Using a Superheated Steam Flame\" - https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/16526/1/Lakey%20Thesis%20Corrected%20Jan%202017.pdf .

        "text": "Hello, non-engineer with a bit of a weird question for RPG worldbuilding. Say i have a vessel with a pipe to siphon water out of it as pictured below. the tube exits the vessel partway up the wall. if the level of water is above the top of the equals sign then it will act as a siphon with a head height from the water level of this vessel to the water level of the vessel it drains into, which is fairly straightforward to calculate flow rate for. \n\n    |       |\n    |      =|=\n    |     //| \\\\\n    |____//_|  \\\\\n                \\\\\n\nHowever, I have conflicting ideas about how to calculate flow rate when the water level is above the bottom of the equals sign but below the top. I've considered a few things:\n\n-Does it just act as a siphon except the head height is from the level of water to the bottom of the equals sign. It is still a sealed tube with a height difference, but it doesn't quite feel right.\n\n-It is a weir? most equations i've found for them assume you have water flowing in an open channel leading up to the drop. so i'm not sure if this is reasonable?\n\n-is it an open channel (considering the pipe as it runs away from the vessel towards wherever it drains). my intuition is that this factor would probably not be limiting the flow rate if the pipe is steep enough, and/or because the fluid has to change directions at the bend.\n\nI'm basically looking for the simplest reasonable implementation, the actual fluid is abstract magical substance so I'm happy to ignore turbidity/friction/flow separation or whatever. Ideally it would be ok to just use Bernoulli's equation for both situations.",
