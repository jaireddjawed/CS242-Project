People may say such things, but that's only in spoken language and is really linguistically wrong.\n\n&gt; Me: ??? I'm pretty sure you could find tons of counterexamples if you looked at any of the text corpora we're trying to parse? \n\n&gt; Bob: But those constructions are wrong! For truly intransitive verbs like \"sleep\" the subject is arg-1, i.e. the patient. But when the subject is arg-0, i.e. the agens, there always has to be an arg-1. \n\n&gt; Me: So when I say \"I'm going to eat now\", you would not be able to understand what I mean?\n\n&gt; Bob: Yeah, that's just incorrect! For transitive verbs, there is always an implicit arg-1, so it always has to be realized on the surface for the sentence to be correct [sic].\n\n&gt; Me: How are you a linguist?",

Another user quickly identified it as the two characters 彩好 *caihao*, meaning roughly \"colorful\" and \"good, like\" respectively. Of course, this isn't actually a Chinese word (smashing that old trope that every Chinese character is a word in and of itself, or that any random combination makes a sentence) regardless of whether you read it left-to-right or the old way, right-to-left. \n\nUser proceeded to say it meant \"good luck\" and that his great-grandfather sold the ring with comics. I noted that it still didn't mean \"good luck\" (which is usually 好運 *haoyun* or 大吉 *daji* in Chinese). He then accused me of trolling him and cited as evidence a [collectible site](http://www.timepassagesnostalgia.com/&amp;pm=0&amp;searchkeywords=Good+Luck+Novelty&amp;sin=g188) where the site owner who admits he does not read Chinese claims it's *four* characters that mean \"Health, Happiness, Prosperity, and Prolonged Life\". \n\nHe also cited the early 20th Century [original document](https://www.flickr.com/photos/11424874@N03/11291297376/) advertising the ring which claimed that the ring's \"Mystic Chinese Symbol\" has \"been looked upon with the deepest reverence by the Chinese for centuries.\" User took that as evidence that it \"certainly is a saying\", because, early 20th century American businessmen never misappropriated other cultures for false claims, right?\n\nEDIT: A **mea culpa**, I'd like to point out that fellow-redditors have pointed out it *does* mean \"fortunately, luckily\" in Cantonese, *hou choi*.

Australis is here to stay, it will be updated and changed, bit it will never be removed by default.\n\nFor context, Firefox recently switched over to a new theme that changes the appearance of the web browser, but while doing so they stripped some poweruser features, and so a lot of people are up-in-arms over that.\n\n[Then this guy shows up](http://np.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/25caji/after_this_latest_update_after_years_of_faithful/chfunry?context=1)\n\n&gt;**Him:** Of course it will.\n\nI figured he was just messing with me. Yes, eventually they will phase out Australis for some new, yet to be worked on design. I figured he knew exactly what I meant and was just toying with my wording.\n\nHe insisted he was incapable of parsing the sentence in any way other than that literal way. He says this, while also showing that he knows what I meant:\n\n&gt;Well, you probably meant it won't be removed for X amount of time, but neither you nor I know what that amount is, and it's extremely stupid to use \"never\" if that's what you meant, because it's literally the opposite of never.\n\nSo I play along, hoping he isn't just being stubborn:\n\n&gt;**Me**: What I mean is they will never remove Australis without a suitable replacement. That is, they will never go back to FF4's design.\n\n# \n\n&gt;**Him:** Then you should have written that.\n\n# \n\n&gt;**Me**: it really should have been obvious what I meant, given the context. It looks like you're just trying to find something to argue over.\n\n# \n\n&gt;**Him:** No, it was not obvious. **There's pretty much only one way to interpret** \"australis will never be removed by default,\" and it's not \"Australis will definitely be removed by a design that is not the same as FF4\"\n\nSo he interpreted what I meant in two ways, but he claims there is only one way to interpret what I meant.\n\nSo I say:\n\n&gt;**Me**: This is stupidly pedantic.  \nAustralis will never be removed. I stand by that. I don't mean it will never be replaced, I mean it will never be rolled back. You could have understood that by parsing the sentence immediately before that one.\n\n&gt;Words hold multiple meanings. There is such a thing as nuance. \n\n#\n\n&gt;**Him:** Yes, but you can't just make up meanings as you go. \n\n# \n\n&gt;**Me**: I clarified what I meant. If you accept that those words can mean what I meant them to, then what are you now arguing over?\n\n#\n\n&gt;**Him:** I can't, because they don't.\n\nSo yeah, once more, \"those words can't mean what I understood them as meaning, only the other way I understood them as meaning, the way that makes you sound stupid\".",

One of my nieces has terribly bad spelling, and since I'm the person who watches them after school I am the one who works with her specially on that. My method is simple: I find out what homeschoolers do, and copy them.\n\nOne very popular method of teaching homeschool spelling is the Spalding method and its spinoffs. Romalda Spalding had some great insights into teaching spelling, but she had a real stick up her butt about the correct way to teach the sounds of the letter y. To her, y is never said as ee. Ever. (Also, no words in English end in the letter i. Those that do aren't really English words. *headdesk*)\n\nThis is the first thing nearly everybody seems to ditch when teaching spelling using her method, because it's the easiest change in the world. Except according to this guy. Yes, monkey is \"really\" pronounced \"monkih\", all dictionaries printed after 1930 are wrong, and have changed much faster than actual spoken language has, it's \"impossible\" to label sounds in human speech, and it is absolutely crazy to think that most people do not use a short i when saying the word pizza. \n\nAnd all this over spelling curriculum.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/2585m1/mandarin_is_objectively_one_of_the_hardest/",
        "text": "In light of /u/Fissr's [recent post](http://np.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/256qcm/robert_lindsay_explains_why_linguist_eggheads/), I decided to go through more of Robert Lindsay's blog. It turns out he has made a [post](https://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2009/12/01/more-on-the-hardest-languages-to-learn-non-indo-european-languages/) that ranks non-IE languages by objective difficulty. For shits, I read through his appraisal of the non-IE language I know best: [Mandarin Chinese](https://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2013/08/19/a-look-at-the-chinese-language/).\n\nHoly shit. Let's begin at the beginning, shall we?\n\nHe claims that English learners will will very quickly hit a wall when learning Mandarin, unlike Japanese. Even though I've just completed my third semester in my uni's Chinese program, I never felt like there was a plateau in my learning of either vocab or grammar; plus, he even bitches in his [post about Japanese](https://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2013/08/21/a-look-at-the-japanese-language/) about the honorifics system and how some grammatically correct sentences are just not commonly said in Japanese.\n\nHe then claims that the character 了 has \"countless\" meanings. I only know of 4: to mark a verb has having been completed (我吃飯了 means I have eaten), to indicate a change of state (下雨了 means it's raining), alongside words showing some degree (太貴了 and 餓死了 meaning too expensive and starving, respectfully), and as a verb meaning to finish or settle. When compared to words such as go and make, 了 is really not that difficult to grasp.\n\nAfter that, we get this gem:\n&gt;The topic-prominence is interesting in that this is the only major language that has what is called topic-comment syntax.\n\nThat settles it guys, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean don't have topic-comment structure. Either that, or they're not major languages.\n\nNext comes claims that sh, ch, and zh all sound the same, along with x, j, and q. Naturally, he forgets that these are only similar to people whose L1 don't have retroflex sounds and lack differences in aspiration. Lindsay also calls retrolex consonants odd, even though they exist in such differing languages as Norwegian, Tamil, and Hindi.\n\n&gt;  There are at least 85,000 symbols and actually many more, but you only need to know about 3-5,000 of them, and many Chinese don’t even know 1,000.\n\n3-5k is a good number to learn for everyday proficiency, but I've never, *ever* heard of a native speaker knowing less than a thousand characters.\n\n&gt; The Communists tried to simplify the system (simplified Mandarin) but instead of making the connections between the phonetic aspects of character more sensible by decreasing their number and increasing their regularity, they simply decreased the number of strokes needed for each symbol without dealing with the phonetic aspect of all.\n\nSometimes, not always. Yes, there are examples like 樂 becoming 乐 and 漢 becoming 汉, but there are also several characters where the phonetic part was changed to be simpler but still meaningful. For example: 鍾 -&gt; 钟. Both of the right parts are pronounced similarly, but the simplified one is obviously simpler.\n\n&gt; And just because you can read Chinese does not mean that you can read Classical Chinese prose. It’s as if it’s written in a different language.\n\nThis is true, because Classical Chinese and Mandarin are *different goddamn languages*.\n\n&gt; Once you learn the character, you know the meaning in any context.\n\nWait, so once you learn a character, you're set for life? Please tell me more about how knowing that 銀 means silver and 行 means walk/go/move makes the meaning of 銀行 obvious. (It means bank, like the building). Plus, doesn't that contradict your previous statements about 了? Make up your mind, Lindsay.\n\n&gt; It’s a real problem when you encounter a symbol you don’t know because there is no way to sound out the word.\n\nYeah, you know that right part in 鍾/钟? That's called the phonetic element. It means at some point, the character as a whole sounded similar or identical to the part on the right. In other words, it's a hint as to the pronunciation. Digression: this is actually how my current Chinese teacher was taught characters as a child: she was given a character she knew like 先 and asked to guess the pronunciation of characters like 洗, 贊, and 詵.\n\n&gt; Similarly, a dictionary is not necessarily helpful when trying to read Chinese. You can have a Chinese sentence in front of you along with a dictionary, and the sentence still might not make sense even after looking it up in the dictionary.\n\nI mean, if I gave that paragraph to a non-English speaker and armed them with just a dictionary, they wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of it either. The issue you describe is not unique to one language.\n\n&gt; It’s little known, but Chinese also uses different forms to count different things, like Japanese.\n\nI'm sorry? I know about 零 vs. 〇, 一 vs. 幺, and 二 vs. 兩, but they're special cases. 〇 is an informal variation of 零 (meaning zero), 幺 is used when giving phone numbers because 一 is pronounced yi1 (so a phone number like 111-1111 would otherwise sound like ee ee ee...), and 兩 is used instead of 二 when a measure word follows. They're the exception when counting, not the rule. Or maybe he's just thinking of the financial numerals? Those are only used in economic situations where the numbers are essential, because, e.g., 三十 (30) could easily be changed using a pen to 三千 (3,000). Even if this is the case, the financial numerals are only used in these rare cases.\n\nEdit: /u/krespa pointed out that when he says \"Chinese also uses different forms to count different things, like Japanese\", Lindsay is probably referring to [classifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_classifier), not different numerals.\n\n&gt; Language professors have rated Chinese as the hardest language on Earth to learn.\n\nI would like to know which \"language professors\" said this. I don't mean people who teach Mandarin, I mean actual linguists.\n\nHe then ends by briefly going over Cantonese, Min Nan, Wu, and Classical Chinese. The first three are all apparently harder than Mandarin for such silly reasons as more tones or vowels, and Classical is just a bit of describing how succinct it is and how you need to know the context to understand any of it (both of which are true).\n\nFinally, all 5 languages are ranked by the patented and flawless 1-5 rating, with 5 being the hardest. All of them get 5. Classifying languages according to such a stupid system is probably the best way to end your largely falsehood-based diatribe about how hard Chinese is.\n\ntl;dr: Robert Lindsay can't Mandarin.\n\nAlso, just to fulfill my red herring quota for the day, Robert Lindsay [supports the Altaic family](https://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2014/02/11/what-is-the-origin-of-the-japanese-language/).",

        "text": "**Warning: Long rant ahead.** \n\n**TL;DR:** Politician forgets high school history and generally is a huge moron.\n\nIn Belgium national elections are approaching (25 May) and as usual politicians decide to open their mouth and blabber about whatever is on their mind. Last week a former journalist, who is now a politician stated that language doesn't play any part in identity. Now, out of context, this might seem like just another misguided, uninformed politician. However, in the context of Flanders, Belgium and politics, it's incomprehensible how he came to this conclusion.\n\nFor those who can read Dutch: here is an article discussing his statement: http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/siegfried-bracke-taal-heeft-niets-met-identiteit-te-maken/article-normal-140143.html\n\nNow, for those unfamiliar with tiny Belgium, here's some background info. In 1830 Belgium declares independence and kicks out the Dutch and their king. French is the dominant and prestige language, Flemish (or Dutch) being the language of the poor lower class. The native French speakers live in the south, the Flemish population in the north. There are more differences between the two populations, but that's too much to get into right now. Conflicts between the two language groups and the encroachment of French on Flemish speaking areas leads to the creation of the language border in 1963. This was mainly wanted by the Flemish populace and politicians. From now on the two languages are separated by this border, which has not changed since (but has lead to much debate and conflicts).\n\nBefore this, the Flemish struggled against the dominance of French and the fact that not speaking French blocked any chance of a career in governmental institutions, the army or politics.\n\nOn top of this, this particular politician is part of a semi-seperatist Flemish party (called NVA, or Nieuw Vlaamse Alliantie in Dutch, New Flemish Alliance in English). This party's origins are rooted in the language conflicts from the past, and basically any other politician in it consider language of major importance. In one town they even demanded a fast food joint change its French name to something more Flemish. They are currently Belgium's biggest political party.\n\nThe statement wasn't a big deal, and most people ignored it, as the man has said other strange things that don't make sense, but it's been bugging me long enough to make this long ass post.\n\n/rant\n\nAdditionally, the article reflects some more general badlinguistics. Instead of asking, you know, a linguist's opinion on the matter, they quote a philosopher comment on the matter. Not that philosophy doesn't have valuable things to say about language, but you'd think they'd ask someone who actually studies language.\n\n(Not mentioned here, but also important context: all of sociolinguistics, the world, world history, etc)\n\nAdditional journalistic circlejerk opinion piece: \"He's totally right, here's a complex and nonsensical explanation why, with a conclusion that's besides the point.\" http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/2461/Opinie/article/detail/1864717/2014/04/26/Siegfried-Bracke-heeft-gelijk-taal-heeft-niets-met-identiteit-te-maken.dhtml\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Let's get in there first and have a look.\n\n&gt;should grammar be prescriptive or descriptive?\n\nIt's up to us!\n\n'Obviously' is actually the most 'misused' word in the English language. We all know what it means but it is most commonly used to mean 'This is what I think:' You will not find this usage in any dictionary, which is how I know it's wrong to use it this way. And yet:\n\n&gt;**Obviously**, the answer lies between those two extremes.\n\nThe answer does not 'lie between those two extremes'. The extremes are 'The wrong one' and 'The right one'. There is no need to be centrist and moderate on the issue and I assume the Guardian is doing so out of habit.\n\n&gt;I am going to speak up here in defence of good grammar\n\nI can tell this is not going to go the way I would like...\n\n&gt;One doesn't need to be Thomas Gradgrind to be interested in the rules underlying the English language,\n\nShe keeps doing this, making me think she's about to start talking sense then suddenly whipping it away. The 'rules underlying the English language' are, according to the author:\n\n&gt;about speaking clearly and plainly and cutting through obfustication.\n\nWhy must we all speak clearly *and* plainly? Isn't she obfusticating by using two adverbs where one would do? Isn't she obfusticating by using a word like 'obfusticating'?\n\n&gt;I learned that grammar was not, weirdly, on the syllabus.\n\nWas was it on the syllabus? Was it normally on the syllabus? Why can't prescriptivists ever speak the language in the way they insist it should be spoken?\n\nOh, I know, it's because the rules are subjective so that even they can't follow them.\n\n&gt;I found learning foreign languages, such as French and Italian, far easier than some of my new English friends did because I understood the subjunctive tense and verb conjugations.\n\nThere you have it. You should learn English grammar because it makes learning other languages easier. What this has to do with the Bad Grammar awards is unclear. Are the judges concerned that, without their award, no-one will be able to speak Italian?\n\n&gt;As for my second piece of evidence for the defence, as anyone who has ever dabbled in internet dating knows, there is no bigger turn-off – none – than a spelling or grammar mistake in a prospective suitor's biography or correspondence.\n\nThis applies to everyone, of course. Absolutely no-one has sex with people who can't identify the passive voice. Or place, weirdly, adverbs in the middle of clauses.\n\nMercifully, this is quite a short article. The 'award' went to Tesco for describing their orange juice as the 'most tastiest' (apparently this is either unclear or unplain, possibly both). This, of course, was a mistake, not a deliberate use of a nonstandard form as is often seen in advertising, like '2nite' or 'drive-thru'. Presumably '2nite' and 'drive-thru' are now acceptable, as McDonald's was not on the shortlist for this years Bad Grammar awards.",
