        "text": "*The idea behind linguistic puzzles is to provide a snippet of information about a language or a group of languages, just enough for you to recognise patterns, formulate a hypothesis and solve the task, without any prior knowledge about the languages necessary. Have fun!*  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly one puzzle today, sorry.\n\n*(by A. E. Kibrik, adapted)*\n\nArchi is one of 25 languages spoken high in the mountains of Daghestan, a semi-autonomous region within the Russian Federation. With less than 1000 speakers, Archi is one of the world's many seriously endangered languages. However, Archi is still used on a daily basis, and speakers maintain a rich tradition of oral folklore and mythology. As you work through this puzzle you will find that the grammar of Archi is very different from that of English or other European languages.\n\nThe following are some Archi sentences and their English translations (Note: the symbols \"I\" and apostrophe represent special sounds of Archi):\n\n1. Diya verkurshi vi. - The father is falling down.\n\n2. HoIn h'oti irkkurshi bi. - The cow is seeking the grass.\n\n3. Boshor baba dirkkurshi vi. - The man is seeking the aunt.\n\n4. Shusha erkurshi i. - The bottle is falling down.\n\n5. HoIn borcirshi bi. - The cow is standing.\n\n6. Diyamu buva dark'arshi di. - The mother is left by the father.\n\n7. Buvamu dogi birkkurshi bi. - The donkey is sought by the mother.\n\n8. Dadamu h'oti irkkurshi i. - The grass is sought by the uncle.\n\n9. Lo orcirshi i. - The child is standing.\n\n10. Buva diya vark'arshi di. - The mother is leaving the father.\n\nYour first task is to translate the following Archi sentences into English:\n\n10. Lo hoIn birkkurshi i.\n\n11. Diya boshor vark'arshi vi.\n\n12. The uncle is sought by the aunt.\n\n13. The donkey is falling down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShort answer: &gt;!10. The child is seeking the cow. 11. The father is leaving the man. 12. Babamu dada virkkurshi vi. 13. Dogi berkurshi bi.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thinking: &gt;!1) Figure out the nouns, starting with 2 and 3 (repeated “cow”, plus “grass”), and word order, which seems to be S(O)V for both active and passive voices. In passive, the subject gets a -mu affix (diya - father, diyamu - by father, as seen in phrases 1 and 6).!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2) The verbs all end in -rshi and have two sets of prefixes and particles: 0/i, b-/bi, d-/di, v-/vi.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3) For passive voice (phrases 6-8), the preliminary rule seems the simplest: is the object of the action is a person, use d-verb di, if it’s an animal, use b-verb bi, and for objects use 0-verb i.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!4) Simple subject-verb phrases (1, 4, 5, 9) seem to have a slightly different set of forms, with v-verb vi used for a person, instead of d-/di. (The child in the same category as the bottle can probably be left aside, cf. with “it” for small babies in English).!&lt;\n\n&gt;!5) We have three full SOV phrases in active voice, 2, 3, and 10. And we already know (assume) that 0/i means object, b-/bi means animal, and d-/di or v-/vi means persons. Comparing phrases 3 and 10, we see that d and v markers are inverted, with dirkkurshi vi for “the man is seeking the aunt” and vark'arshi di for “the mother is leaving the father”. Meaning that the language also has a male/female distinction, and phrase 1 makes it obvious that v-marker is male. Therefore, the prefix indicates the object of the action, and the post-verb particle indicates the subject.!&lt;",

Since they're considered a single language, even though they compose a dialect continuum, all other dialect continua should be considered so too. For example, the Romance languages are in fact just dialects of Vulgar Latin, and are only differentiated because of politics. \n\nOn the other hand, one could argue that this would be stretching the definition of \"language\" too much. Geographically far away dialects are often mutually unintelligible. If the transitioning dialects between them suddenly went extinct or did not exist, they would seem like, and could be classified as, completely separate languages. Plus, one could argue that dialects within a dialect continuum being considered part of the same language is due to politics. \n\nI'm really confused. Linguistics often gets tangled with nationalism and politics due to its nature, and that makes everything so unclear.",

        "text": "For Japanese, I would predict OVS. This is because Japanese is SOV but many sentences are just OV without S. Because of this, when the sentence is confusing or not clear enough, they sometimes add the S (*subject*) at the end (*OVS*).      \n\n\nFor English, it's a little more difficult to make a prediction. Maybe OSV. For example, instead of the common way of speaking in English (\"*I was reading that book*\"), someone might say \"*That book is what I was reading*\", which can then get shortened down into an OSV sentence \"*That book, I was reading.*\". I also think it's possible for adjectives to come after nows. For example \"*The man who was sad and tired went to bed early*\", might get shortened to \"*the man, sad and tired, wnent to bed early*\".      \n\n\nBased on everything you know about the English language and linguistics, how do you think English is most likely to change in terms of word order?",

But ALSO people act like English has always been the same exact thing. Language is forever changing. And to act like there is a right or wrong way to speak is incredibly ignorant. In Spanish people are starting to use “Elle” (at least in scholarly settings, in place of gendered pronouns “el/ella”) I had a friend say “how are people trying to change a whole language?” Does she not realize that the Spanish people speak now is not the same as even a hundred years ago. Same goes for English. Both Spanish and English and most languages today, if not all, have stemmed from other languages anyways.",

I've been looking all over and I havent found any...(im located in the US). I'm looking for online degrees because I recieved a liver transplant a few months ago so going to school while immunocompromised, away from the hospital, or living in a dorm with people who could be sick is kinda scary for me. I got into lingustics because I love languages and teaching english. Ive done a ton of ESL tutoring with adults and I loved it. I've looked for English BA's online with lingustics concentrations or minors, even Anthropology, World languages &amp; Communications/media but im really not finding anything. There is a Speech and Hearing science degree offered online at ASU. I'm interested in the science aspects of language so I think this might be the best fit, but do you think it will suffice for ESL teaching? Im more interested in working as a private tutor btw. I think it might be good for accent or dialect work, but I understand non-natives might have issues with language that arent a disorder and can't really apply to those situations. I just have no idea about what I should look for. Is there any other major online that you would reccomend? \n\nps: The reason I'm hesitant to just go for English is because its more literature focused which isnt really what im looking for. \n\nThank you all so much for your help.",

I did some research online and I thought that it looked like Nabatean Arabic, do any of you guys know what it says? :) \n\nAlso, here is a nice story about the Petra and the Nabatean people:\n\nWhen petra flourished as the capital of the Nabataeans in the 1st cent. AD (then called Raqmu), there might have been many languages spoken there as it lay on a major trade route. The Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab people, were very successful traders who could navigate the Arabian deserts to bring goods from the coast of the Arabian peninsula up into Palestine to trade with the Roman Empire. With their wealth they built the striking monuments hewn out of the rock canyons that are famous today.\n\nIt is generally agreed that they spoke an early form of Arabic which scholars call Nabataean Arabic, as well as a dialect of Aramaic which was a lingua franca used for commercial and political purposes. Most of their inscriptions have been found to be written in Aramaic although with a heavy influence of Arabic vocabulary. They adapted the Aramaic script for their own language and produced a cursive script from which the current Arabic script developed.\n\nThe Namara Inscription is a pre-Islamic inscription written in the Nabataean script. It is considered to be one of the most important and earliest artefacts attesting to the origins of the Arabic language, possibly written in a late form of the Nabataean dialect in its transition to Arabic.\n\nThe Nabataeans later adopted Christianity and became Hellenised, assimilating into the Byzantine world, likely picking up Greek as well. As new maritime trade routes superseded the old desert routes, the old Nabataean way of life began to wane. By the Islamic Period, only a few nomadic tribes lived in the area and the city was forgotten until it was made famous in the Western world by the Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in the early 1800s",
