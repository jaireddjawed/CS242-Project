I’m wondering if anyone with a similar size wrist has any input. My gut tells me to go with the 37mm, but I don’t want to take away from the “dive-iness” of the watch too much, if that makes any sense. Any input would be appreciated.\n\nThanks !",

        "text": "I recently purchased a Casio G-Shock watch model \"GM-S2100CH-1ADR\" online, but I found out it's a women's model. The men's version of this model is not available anymore. I attached some images to this post to show you how the watch looks on my wrist.\n\nI am in a dilemma about whether to keep the watch or return it and look for a men's version. The watch fits me well, but I'm concerned about the size and the overall design, as it's marketed towards women. I don't want to be seen as wearing a women's watch.\n\nOn the other hand, I really like the features of this watch, especially the dial and the colour tone. It's stylish and rugged at the same time, and it's an excellent value for its price. I'm also worried about the hassle of returning it and not finding a suitable men's version.\n\nI would appreciate your thoughts and opinions on this matter. Is the size and design of this watch too feminine for a man to wear? Should I keep it, or should I return it and look for a men's version? Have you been in a similar situation before, and what did you do?\n\nThank you in advance for your input.",

        "text": "This is an appreciation post for OVM. I love my Steinhart OVM V3. It is my first watch with Swiss movement. I bought it 4 years ago when I became a medical practitioner to commemorate the occasion. It served me throughout the pandemic and never to impress me whenever I looked at it. But there are small improvement that can be done by the company in my humble opinion. I would like to read your comments on them and know if you have any more suggestions while hoping for Steinhart to read this thread. My suggdstions are: \n\n1) Produce to watch with 39mm or 40mm case size while making the dial, the hands and the hour markers proportioned to the size. I know that many of you would recommend me to just buy a Gnomon exclusive but Gnomon exclusive does not meet my suggestions in that it has bigger hands and hour markers compared to the dial. And because of this fact dial/markers/hands looks out of proportion compared to the original OVM and real watch that it is inspired from (Mil Sub) in my opinion. \n\n2) Make the lugs closer to the wrist instead of make them straight. It would improve the wearability greatly. \n\n3) This one is an extra but I would love to see a brighter lume while keeping the green color on my watch. \n\n4) And this one is just out of curiosity:  I swim and dive with my dive watches as well. I tested my Steinhart only once by diving with it in the open sea in 12 meters depth. It worked perfectly without any problems. But I read in the forums that some users had problems while diving with them. If that is true I would suggest to improve the brand's pressure testing to make hobbyist divers like me to feel confident while using our watches in the sea. \n\nI would like to read your comments on this subject. Thanks in advace...",

I tried to keep it as concise as possible, it's still a huge daily update:\n\n# What's new\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[**IWC Launches Individualisation Program So You Can Customize Your Portugieser Chronograph**](https://monochrome-watches.com/introducing-individualisation-service-customisation-unique-piece-iwc-portugieser-chronograph/)\n\n/ It’s nothing new in the world of micro-brands that you can customize your watch to order. It’s almost become a norm with some brands, a norm that has crept into some lower-tier mass produced watches like Certina, as well. But no large and established watchmaker has offered a significant customization program.\n\nWell, hello IWC. While there is much to criticize the brand for we have to give credit where credit is due - IWC is introducing a customization program to create your personal version of the Portugieser Chronograph IW3716. Yes, the customization program will be limited in numbers as well as location availability, but it’s still a major step that other large brands might want to pay atention to.\n\nAvailable only at the Dubai Mall and Shanghai Taikoo Hui Mall IWC stores, buyers of the individual Portugieser Chrono will get to chose live with the sales representative between two cases (steel and 18k rose gold), 16 dial colors, rhodium or gold-plated appliques and hands and a number of straps including colourful calfskin or alligator leather, leather alternatives such as TimberTex and rubber straps, or a stainless steel bracelet.\n\nOnce the customer builds his spec, the watch will be shipped to them in three weeks and a small “I” in a circle, placed in the small seconds sub-counter at 6 o’clock, will identify each chronograph as an individually configured version. No word on price yet, but this could be such a fantastic program if other manufacturers would introduce ti to models more interesting than the Portugieser Chrono.\n\n[**NOMOS Is Introducing a Bunch of New Watches this Easter**](https://deployant.com/nomos-glashutte-watches-for-easter/)\n\n/ A couple of days ago we wrote about the new NOMOS Tangente Neomatik Blue Gold which is covered in gold and then, curiously, painted blue so you can’t see the gold. But it seems they’re coming out with a whole bunch more watches before Easter.\n\nThere’s the Tangente 33 champagne with a, duh, champagne colored dial in 33mm and an in-house movement. The Club Campus with the fantastic California dial gets two new colorways - a very loud future orange and a funky blue purple that’s almost gray. The Club Sport neomatik petrol on steel comes in a great green, with the super flat DUW 3001 automatic caliber.\n\nTo round off the releases, NOMOS is also introducing a very limited edition of only 175 units worldwide of the Tetra Neomatik in red. Looks fantastic if you’re into square watches.\n\n[**Junghans Embraces Color, Comes Out Swinging With Some Bangers for This Year!**](https://www.fratellowatches.com/an-overview-of-junghans-novelties-launched-at-inhorgenta-munich-2023/)\n\n/ Speaking of minimalist watches like the NOMOS, Junghans has a couple of new ones as well. We know and love them for the Max Bill and Bauhaus aesthetics, but Junghans goes very bold on the colors and introduces some must haves - the Meister Chronoscope could be the chrono to have this year, while the Junghans Meister Damen is a women’s watch without screaming “I’m made by men, for women!” \n\nLet’s sum it up in a few bulletpoints: \n\n* The Max Bill line gets a new Chronoscope Bauhaus model and two new MEGA Solar models. The Chronoscope Bauhaus gets red accents on the date wheel and hands, breaking up the clean blandness of the model and it retails for €2,295. The Max Bill MEGA Solar (€1,075) is also getting the red treatment with a red date wheel and red numerals. An additional model in gold PVD (€1,175) is new to the lineup. \n* The newest Meister Damen model (€1,340) features a sunburst green dial, with diamond cut dauphine hands and a macchiato ostrich strap further. It’s an absolute beauty and measures 33mm. \n* The Meister fein collection additions are the most varied in style. The most traditional of the new offerings is the Signatur (€1,690). At just under 40mm, the classic dress-style watch features a light gray brushed dial with diamond-cut hour markers. The latest additions to the Meister fein Automatic collection (€1,390) are much more playful. Three new colorways — Arctic Blue, Moss Green, and Blackberry. The strap colors are not matching but are complementary. It’s a lot of color, but looks good. The final additions to the Meister fein collection is the Chronoscope MEGA Solar which packs a perpetual calendar, chronograph, and connected solar movement into a 39.5mm case that is under 10mm thick. Available in stainless steel (€1,390) and a rose gold PVD version (€1,490) on leather straps they’re very nice. \n* The only potential disappointment of the collection are the three models in the new Meister Pilot line - the Meister Pilot in navy blue and a new Meister Pilot Chronoscope in navy blue and “desert” colorways. The cases are meh, the bezel is different in a wrong way and, shockingly, the dial is extremely busy. If you like them, they come in at €1,990 for the Pilot and €2,590 for the two Pilot Chronoscopes. \n* The final release, the Meister Chronoscope, could just be the best chrono release of the year. Especially if Rolex doesn’t make a new Daytona model. The sapphire-gray dial features a circular sunray finish and the brand’s beloved “dimple” sub-dials in an anthracite hue. All of the sub-dials play home to orange hands for a tasteful but vivid flash of color. Measuring 40.7mm in diameter and 13.9mm thick, it is larger than the Meister fein pieces but smaller than the Pilot chronographs. While the thickness may put some people off, keep in mind that a portion of it is due to the domed and double-AR-coated sapphire crystal. Offered on a brown ostrich strap for €2,140\n\n[**It’s all about color today - Bamford London has a New Collection, Bamford B80, With Some Very Nice Hues**](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/bamford-london-debuts-b80-titanium-watches/)\n\n/ If you didn’t know, Bamford is actually split up into two brands - Bamford Watch Department, which produces custom versions of other brands’ designs, and Bamford London which largely produces its own original models and even collaborates with other entities from outside the world of watches. \n\nBanford London is introducing a new collection, Bamford B80, which a bit cornily bases three models on the “pillars of the Bamford brand: heritage, modernity, and adventure”. Swiping that marketing-talk to the side, Bamford has three actually nice looking watches, differentiated by their dials and bracelets. \n\nThe case of the Bamford B80 is 39mm in diameter, 10.5mm thick, with 20mm lugs and is bead-blasted titanium. The B80 Heritage has 3-6-9 Arabic numeral hour markers and is available with either a black dial that has red accents, or a navy blue dial with yellow accents. The B80 Modern has a dial with a full track of Arabic markers, with a black dial and aqua blue highlits, as well as one with yellow Arabic numerals with bright red and blue accents set against a black surface. The B80 Adventure features a dial with simple squares and rectangles for its hour markers with three variants - green, bright orange, and walnut brown and contrasting second hands. \n\nPowering the Bamford London B80 collection is the Sellita SW300-1 automatic movement, and the watches come in at £1,250 GBP (approximately $1,500 USD at the time of writing).\n\n[**Hey, Guess What? Yeah, More Color News.

Now Fortis is introducing a BUNCH of new colors. And I mean a bunch. Click through the link and you’ll see that there are 14 new possible colorway and strap combinations for their three models.\n\n[**Fratello Teams up With Nivada Grenchen for Five Limited Edition Chronos**](https://www.fratellowatches.com/introducing-the-fratello-x-nivada-grenchen-racing-chronograph/)\n\n/ One of our favorite watch sites has teamed up with Nivada to create a line of vintage inspired watches. They worked with the brand to dig up their catalogue and decided to use the the vintage Chronosport (for the case) and the Racing chronograph (for the dial) for inspiration.\n\nCredit where credit is due - since the Fratello × Nivada Grenchen Racing Chronograph is inspired by two vintage watches, they didn’t blow it up to 44mm. The case measures 38mm, 13.75mm thick and 44.3mm from lug tip to lug tip. The watch is available with five different dials and will run you €1,499 at a pre-order price, excluding VAT. Only 50 pieces (10 for each dial variation) for pre-order will be available from the Fratello Shop a week from now.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# On hand - a selection of reviews\n\n[I’m betting there’s a lot of Citizen Nighthawk fans with us here.

While it came with a quality bracelet in the three link Rolex Oyster Bracelet style, I don’t like the way it fits. Recently, I’ve been really liking the look of the jubilee and especially president bracelet styles, but I understand that they are supposed to be worn on Day-Dates and Datejusts. My question is, would wearing a Rolex-style president or jubilee bracelet (like the pictures below) on my diver look goofy? Would I be committing watch sacrilege? Thanks.",
