        "text": "I know this a fairly hotly debated topic, as well as one discussed in the past on this sub. However, the most recent post on the subject is several years old and new studies may have been released. \n\nOn the subject of nitrates in processed meats (specially turkey products in my case, as I do not eat pork). Is the general consensus at this point in time there is not enough information to make a solid correlation to colorectal cancer? I have seen many articles saying eating processed meat daily can increase your risk by as much as 18%. However, eating processed meats is also generally associated with an all around unhealthy diet. Is this more the situation, causation does not equal correlation as there are other factors at work? \n\nAdditionally, I have read that consuming vitamin C actually reduces the conversion of nitrosamines from nitrates. Is there solid evidence to back this up? For example, if someone ensures they consume their DRI of Vitamin C, would this mitigate the risk at all or completely?\n\nI'd love to hear everyone's opinions and where they stand on this subject based on the research currently available. I love chicken and turkey Sausages, as well as turkey lunch meat but I have stopped eating them almost completely due to my fear on this. I know everything should be generally okay in moderation but regardless.",

There are a lot of people that push non-meat diets for reasons that have nothing to do with nutrition, but because they believe that eating meat hurts the environment.  This should be completely unrelated to nutrition.\n\nEthical concerns about eating animals.

Like is the freshness where the nutrients come from? I can elaborate if it doesn’t make sense but now I’m really curious",

Cùng tìm hiểu cách*** [***bổ sung sắt***](https://viamclinic.vn/bai-viet/bo-sung-sat-o-tre-em/) ***cho bà bầu đúng cách trong bài viết dưới đây:***\n\n  \n\nThiếu máu do thiếu sắt khi mang thai có thể khiến bạn cảm thấy cơ thể yếu đuối và mệt mỏi. Bài viết này sẽ cho bạn biết các yếu tố rủi ro, triệu chứng và những gì bạn có thể làm để tránh tình trạng này.\n\n&gt;***Tham khảo thêm:*** [*Hướng dẫn bổ sung sắt đúng cách và hiệu quả*](https://viamclinic.vn/bai-viet/huong-dan-bo-sung-sat-dung-cach-va-hieu-qua/)*.*\n\nNếu bạn đang mang thai, bạn có nguy cơ cao bị thiếu máu do thiếu sắt. Thiếu máu do thiếu sắt là tình trạng bạn không có đủ các tế bào hồng cầu khỏe mạnh để mang oxy đến các mô của cơ thể. Việc tìm hiểu lý do tại sao thiếu máu khi mang thai xảy ra và những gì bạn có thể làm để ngăn chặn nó là rất quan trọng.\n\n## Nguyên nhân gây thiếu máu do thiếu sắt khi mang thai?\n\nCơ thể bạn sử dụng sắt để tạo ra huyết sắc tố. Hemoglobin là một loại protein trong các tế bào hồng cầu mang oxy đến các mô của bạn. Khi mang thai, lượng máu trong cơ thể bạn tăng lên và lượng sắt bạn cần cũng tăng theo.\n\nCơ thể bạn sử dụng sắt để tạo ra nhiều máu hơn để cung cấp oxy cho cả thai nhi. Nếu bạn không có đủ lượng sắt dự trữ hoặc không có đủ sắt trong khi mang thai, bạn có thể bị thiếu máu do thiếu sắt.\n\n## Thiếu máu do thiếu sắt khi mang thai ảnh hưởng thế nào đến thai nhi?\n\nThiếu máu do thiếu sắt trầm trọng trong thai kỳ làm tăng nguy cơ sinh non (khi sinh trước 37 tuần của thai kỳ). Thiếu máu do thiếu sắt khi mang thai cũng liên quan đến việc sinh con nhẹ cân và trầm cảm sau sinh. Một số nghiên cứu cũng cho thấy tình trạng này làm tăng nguy cơ tử vong ở trẻ sơ sinh ngay trước hoặc sau khi sinh.\n\n## Các yếu tố nguy cơ\n\nBạn có nhiều nguy cơ bị thiếu máu khi mang thai nếu bạn:\n\n* Có hai lần mang thai gần nhau\n* Đang mang thai nhiều hơn một em bé\n* Thường xuyên bị nôn do ốm nghén\n* Không tiêu thụ đủ thực phẩm giàu chất sắt\n* Có kinh nguyệt nặng trước khi mang thai\n* Có tiền sử thiếu máu trước khi mang thai\n\nTriệu chứng:\n\n* Mệt mỏi\n* Suy nhược\n* Chóng mặt hoặc lâng lâng\n* Đau đầu\n* Da nhợt nhạt hoặc hơi vàng\n* Khó thở\n* Thèm ăn đá hoặc nhai đá (hội chứng pica)\n\nCác triệu chứng thiếu máu nặng có thể bao gồm:\n\n* Nhịp tim nhanh\n* Huyết áp thấp\n* Khó tập trung\n\nTuy nhiên, hãy nhớ rằng các triệu chứng thiếu máu thường giống với các triệu chứng mang thai nói chung. Bất kể bạn có triệu chứng hay không, bạn sẽ được xét nghiệm máu để sàng lọc bệnh thiếu máu khi mang thai. Nếu bạn lo lắng về mức độ mệt mỏi của mình hoặc bất kỳ triệu chứng nào khác, hãy nói chuyện với bác sĩ.\n\n## Phòng ngừa và điều trị thiếu máu do thiếu sắt khi mang thai như thế nào?\n\n📷\n\nCác loại Vitamin uống bổ sung trước khi sinh thường chứa sắt. Uống vitamin trước khi sinh có chứa sắt có thể giúp ngăn ngừa và điều trị bệnh thiếu máu do thiếu sắt trong thai kỳ. Trong một số trường hợp, bác sĩ có thể đề nghị bạn uống bổ sung sắt riêng. Khi mang thai, bạn cần 27 mg sắt mỗi ngày.\n\n                  ***Tham khảo thêm:***[ *Nên ăn gì trong 3 tháng cuối thai kỳ để con phát triển tốt?*](https://viamclinic.vn/bai-viet/nen-an-gi-trong-3-thang-cuoi-thai-ky-de-con-phat-trien-tot/)\n\nDinh dưỡng tốt cũng có thể ngăn ngừa thiếu máu do thiếu sắt khi mang thai. Các nguồn cung cấp chất sắt trong chế độ ăn uống bao gồm thịt nạc đỏ, thịt gia cầm và cá. Các lựa chọn khác bao gồm ngũ cốc ăn sáng tăng cường chất sắt, rau lá xanh đậm, các loại đậu và đậu Hà Lan.\n\nSắt từ các sản phẩm động vật, chẳng hạn như thịt là dễ hấp thu nhất. Để tăng cường hấp thu sắt từ các nguồn thực vật và chất bổ sung, hãy kết hợp chúng với thực phẩm hoặc đồ uống giàu vitamin C – chẳng hạn như nước cam, nước ép cà chua hoặc dâu tây. Nếu bạn uống bổ sung sắt cùng với nước cam, hãy tránh loại có bổ sung cả canxi. Mặc dù canxi là một chất dinh dưỡng thiết yếu trong thai kỳ, nhưng canxi có thể làm giảm khả năng hấp thụ sắt.\n\n## Thiếu máu do thiếu sắt khi mang thai được điều trị như thế nào?\n\nNếu bạn đang dùng vitamin trước khi sinh có chứa sắt và bị thiếu máu, bác sĩ có thể đề nghị xét nghiệm để xác định các nguyên nhân có thể khác. Trong một số trường hợp, bạn có thể cần gặp bác sĩ chuyên điều trị rối loạn máu (bác sĩ huyết học). Nếu nguyên nhân là do thiếu sắt, bác sĩ có thể đề nghị uống bổ sung sắt riêng.\n\nNếu bạn có tiền sử cắt bỏ dạ dày hoặc phẫu thuật ruột non hoặc không thể dung nạp sắt bổ sung qua đường uống, bạn có thể cần phải truyền sắt qua tĩnh mạch.\n\nChi tiết: [https://viamclinic.vn/bai-viet/bo-sung-sat-cho-ba-bau-dung-cach/](https://viamclinic.vn/bai-viet/bo-sung-sat-cho-ba-bau-dung-cach/)",
