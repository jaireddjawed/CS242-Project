        "text": "LTL, FTP\n\nI got my first job at the ripe old age of 19. I hadn't finished college, but I was friendly, and easily landed a job in food service. I was an excellent employee. I could keep the dining room pristine and run a front register, or run the drive thru solo, even on weekends, which was impressive because my store was located in a college town. We were so busy that we had the record for the highest sales hourly, daily, and weekly for a long time. I excelled at this job to the point that I received the employee of the month award 3 times (we were limited to once every six months) in the first year and a half that I worked with the company, which was accompanied by a 25¢ an hour raise.\n\nChanges at home led to my moving to another city and transferring to another location. This store was toxic. I had to restart all my tests to qualify as a trainer, and couldn't get promoted to save my life, even as people I trained (in spite of not having the title, pay, or red shirt associated with being a trainer) were being promoted to trainers and managers. This location had high turnover, no employee of the month, and kept jerking my schedule around to plug holes in the schedule. \n\nI kept coming into work, still smiling and friendly, convinced that if I just kept working hard, it would pay off, since there was no way this store could be that different from my former \"home\" store.\n\n10 months later, I was tired, angry, and anxious. The drive to work nearly made me throw up from how stressed I became, and my customer service smile became more an expression of panic than pleasure as I BLASTed customer complaints (everywhere seems to have a customer service acronym, don't ask me why). I still came in, primarily to help my team, many of whom I was fond. Then our GM left to mismanage a new, bigger store. In his place, we received a woman I'll call S.\n\nS was an awful woman. She had done some of her MIT training at the beginning of my time at the second store during her pregnancy, and we had all written off her terrible attitude and bad decision making as pregnancy hormones. This was apparently not the case. She became even more tyrannical and abrasive. My schedule stabilized into a nightmare of working from 5-close 6 nights a week, putting me at 60-64 hours a week.\n\nThe part that killed me wasn't the hours, though, it was her frequent declaration of my uselessness. I was described as \"expendable,\" \"replaceable,\" and \"a waste.\" These were not one-off comments, they were worked into almost every single conversation I had with this woman for 6 straight weeks. I started looking for another job around the 3 week mark. \n\nI received a call from one of the places I applied for and went through the interview process, culminating in a conditional job offer, pending my ability to pass a drug test. Fuck yes!\n\nThe call came right after I clocked in, and, as luck would have it, right before S noticed me. My intent was to turn in my 2 weeks, but then came the words from her mouth, \"Ugh, you again. I don't know why you bother coming in. Any of my cashiers can do your job.\"\n\nI froze. Then I smiled. \"Okay, then. You should let them know that. Bye.\" \n\nI clocked out, said my goodbyes, and refused her call asking me to return the day before orientation at my new job. After all, I'm expendable, and anyone can do my job, right?\n\nETA: Got a hold of one of my former colleagues, and the fallout was pretty sweet. Apparently S tried to force several cashiers to take those shifts. Most refused, since minors can't work those kinds of hours, but the other two tried to handle it and couldn't. One quit, the other demanded to be put back on day shift or she would quit, too. \n\nPlan B was to force some of the kitchen staff that I had trained to take the hours, but they only cross-trained to get promoted, not because they wanted to work with the public. It culminated in 4 of the 6 other closers quitting. That forced day shift people with open availability sheets into closing shifts, eventually leading to another fairly large exodus. She lost nearly a third of her store, all together. \n\nWithin 6 months she had lost the store, and eventually her job. The store is still constantly hiring, but the turnover has stabilized to relatively normal food service levels, and one of the two closers who stayed is now the GM. He worked hard and put up with a lot of crap to get the position, and I'm glad someone with a heart is in charge now. \n\nAs to why I didn't escalate the situation, our DM had recently left the company, and he was the only one who had contact information up for employees to see. Corporate seemed content to leave us DM-less, and that realization is what led to me putting in applications. If my company didn't care about me, there was no reason for me to care about my company. I didn't realize that there was any legal recourse to be had. I was young, dumb, and sleep deprived.\n\nAnd sorry, guys, not JJ's or Pizza Hut. I have worked at both, but it was somewhere else. I may stop by the store sometime soon for a seasonal watermelon milkshake, though, since they should be offering it soon. ;)",

        "text": "This happened back in college, like 9 or 10... I was 19 or 20, lets leave it at that.\n\nI worked in a warehouse doing shipping and receiving with another guy, call him CG for Cool Guy. He was a year younger than me and was also in college. We held that place down, I mean almost no mistakes, got along great, had a system that worked with our school schedules. AWESOME, right.\n\nFirst, somethings about the job. It was a computer repair place where broken equipement was received on one side of the warehouse. It would be unboxed, put on a cart, brought to the other side (processing side PS) of the warehouse, checked in and then put on a shelf to be fixed. We had an office that was in the main building where customers would come in and place/pick up order. There was a window in the office that let you look into the PS. We would get new/referb equipement (in the main office) to ship throughout the day, which were shipped on the PS.\n\nIn the morning, I would get the recieving from the delivery guy and do all that work, while CG would work in the office. After lunch, I would work in the office while GC would do all the shipping. In the office we took phone calls, placed orders, got the shipping/receiving paper work handled, delt with walkin customers, so on and so forth.\n\nWell the company didnt really like the idea that two 19/20 year olds running their warehouse without any real supervision. Our boss worked on the second floor, good boss, but had a million other things to do. So one day they hired a guy to be the warehouse manager, we will call him Dick Head (DH). Sidenote, the company did the 90 day trail thing, they can let you go without reason within the first 90 days.\n\nSome thing that DH did that made him a dick head: Within a week or so, DH kicked us out of the office. We had to do all our work in this warehouse that had no AC or heat. DH put a big whiteboard in the office window so we could not see what he was doing (which was pretty much nothing). DH wouldnt put anything back where it went and then yelled at us when he couldnt find something. One time DH yelled at me, I got back in DH's face and DH pulled out a box cutter... store for another time.\n\nOn to the big incident.\n\nOne day I was doing the receiving and there were about 3 good size boxes address to DH directely. I unboxed everything else (not DH's stuff) like normal, but it on my cart, wheeled it to the PS and told DH there are three boxes for him. Then I asked DH where I should put them. DH got all mad and started yelling, and it when something like:\n\nDH: \"Dont worry about it, just leave them there and I will get them. All you need to do is tell me something came in for me. YOU DO YOUR JOB AND I'LL DO MINE!\"\n\nMe: \"Alright man, whatever you say.\"\n\nNow you see, the warehouse is pretty big and we had a lot of expensive equipement/inventory. So there were a few gates with locks you had to get through to go from one side to the other. Also these boxes werent really big/heavy but you really did need a dolly (hand truck) to move them all at once. Sooo, after he blew up at me, I didnt say anything else.\n\nA few minutes later he goes into the warehouse, walks all the way to the other side and then comes back all pissed off.\n\nDM: \"WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME I NEEDED A DOLLY!\"\n\nMe: \"You told me to just tell you, that you got something. Not that...\"\n\nDM: \"WELL I NEED TO KNOW WHEN I NEED THE DOLLY!\"\n\nMe: \"Alright man, whatever you say.\"\n\nHe Grabs the dolly, gets the boxes, comes back... whatever. Not even the best part.\n\nA couple days go by and I need to leave early because I got a test or some shit at school. Well, I get this super small (fit in your pocket small) box in, with his name on it. You can see where this is going. I tell CG what I am about to do and that I am leaving right after I tell DH he has a box... Let me know what happens when I get in tomorrow.\n\nI get my stuff done, tell DH he as a box and then say I am out for the rest of the day. I dont tell him how big the box is and I didnt tell him he needed a dolly, because he didnt.\n\nNext day CG tells me, about 5 minutes after I left, DH goes in the warehouse, gets the dolly, goes to the other side of the warehouse, looks around for about 2 minutes, picks up the tiny box and is super pissed. DH goes back to the PS and then goes out side looking for me, but I was long gone at that point.\n\nDH never said a thing to me but damn that still makes me smile. DH was let got within his 90 days, me and CG ran that shit alone the rest of the time I was there.",

        "text": "/u/LordBowler423 reminded me of this with his Pizza box story. \n\nWhen I was in high school I used to go work with my father during the school holidays. He was the manager of a quite large butchery with easily 50 odd people on the cutting floor alone. I loved it because we would start at 3am and work until midday, so I still had time to myself and I got a metric shittonne of money for a 14 year old. My job was pretty easy, I would just help with anything that needed to be done, from packing steaks to mincing meat. (Note: This was easily 20 years ago, labor laws were not really strict at this point). There was one job I hated more than ever, it was prepping the boxes to take packed meat. \n\n\nAnother note, I did not work directly for my father. He believed that there should be some separation between us so I reported to the floor supervisor. As I was 14 years old and the bosses son, he disliked me immediately. The cutting floor was downstairs, the boxing room was upstairs. Enter Paul*. Paul was hired under an IHC scheme for people with intellectual disabilities, he was paid pretty well to stand around and have the boxes prepped for filling. The boxes were shipped in bundles of 200 and all we would do is almost completely make them up, tape them, but just leaving the top folded inside the box. They were then stored in this room and dropped through a hole in the floor down to the cutting floor as needed. Normally a couple of stacks at a time. \n\nPaul* was quite slow and often he would run out of boxes, so someone would be sent up to assist. That person was usually me. I would go and help for a bit, get a bunch of stacks made and then head back down. Paul* would keep it maintained for a while but he would eventually run out. On the other hand, I was quite fast. There were actually records on the wall with times of who could make a full stack fastest, and you know who was at the top. Anyway, to the compliance. \n\nNormal day, Paul* ran out of boxes and I am shipped up there. Spend about 20 minutes getting more boxes made up and head back down to what I was originally doing. Floor supervisor did not like that I was done so quickly and he said \"Stay up there and make boxes until I say to stop\". That's exactly what I did. I filled up the room, floor to ceiling (remember this is an industrial building, so it had super tall walls), I filled up the hallway outside the room, just leaving enough room to walk through. I filled up the locker room, I even added cardboard partitions to make a false ceiling so I could stack even more boxes on top of that. I did this over three days before the floor supervisor decided that he needed me downstairs. Needless to say, he was not amused, however everyone else was. There is never a greater sense of achievement than seeing a bunch of butchers running up a flight of stairs and nearly falling over laughing. Paul* was beside himself because he didn't have to do any work and for a brief moment I was a hero.\n\nMy actions earned me more work back on the floor, but to this day I am still satisfied. \n",

        "text": "Unsure if this fits here or in r/pettyrevenge, but I'll let you fair people be the judge.\n\n TL:DR - coworker assumes I'll do a task when I've been assigned elsewhere and gossips that I'm not doing my job. Supervisor corrects them at performance review.\n\nBackstory: I work in an understaffed quality department at a production facility. Except for Supervisor and Shift Lead, the techs share duties and some responsibilities. The only real distinction we have for daily duties is what room we're assigned to that day. For clarity, we have all duties and side work written up and organized for each room so there's no confusion. When we have the manpower we'll have two techs, each assigned a room, and a float to assist both rooms and do side work. For a while I remained a float while the other two techs, I'll call them Tech1 and Tech2, switched rooms and things worked well. Tech1 is the focus of this story as we don't really enjoy each other's company but we can work together (usually) without issue. Supervisor didn't care as long as work got done. It's not impossible to get the work done without a float, you just don't have as much free time for (smoke)breaks. On a personal note, I take my float job seriously and don't use it as an excuse to sit on my ass. I take care of the preventative maintenance as well as emergency maintenance on our machines. I do the chemists job of mixing solutions and standards as well as perform investigations. The other techs are trained to do it as well but I usually get to them first. While I am not the fastest worker, I am a hard worker.\n\n\nStory: Due to extra investigations on top of helping out the two techs, my work load had increased a lot one week. Supervisor decided Monday afternoon that Tech1 and Tech2 can survive without me for one day and told everyone that tomorrow, Tuesday, I would be in the office finishing up the multiple reports so we wouldn't end up behind at the end of the month.\n\nThe next morning I make a pot of coffee and prepare myself for a day at a desk (deskwork is not something I normally do so I knew it was going to be a long day). Tech1 and Tech2 go to their respective rooms and start their tasks. Tech1 is in a room where I would normally run an analysis that tests samples taken every few hours. At morning break I hear Tech1 and Shift Lead talking and Shift Lead reminds Tech1 that I'll be in the office all day and Tech1 will need to make sure everything gets done. Tech1 gives a \"Yeah that's fine.\" I specifically remember this because I my spidey-sense went off, thinking something would be overlooked.\n\nThe day rolls on and thankfully the reports are fairly easy to type up and send out. I take a break at 3pm to stretch my legs and walk around the room when I spot it. A pile of samples meant for the analysis I usually run. I flip through the paperwork and confirm that nothing has been done for these samples which is a problem because they are important to our environmental department. So I return to the office to find Shift Lead.\n\nMe: \"Hey Shift Lead, you and Supervisor tell Tech1 I would be in here today?\"\nShift Lead: \"Yeah\" giving me a puzzled 'duh' look. \"Why?\"\nMe: \"Because Tech1 still hasn't done them and it's already 3.\"\n\nThe shift lead muttered a curse and went out to find Tech1 while I sat down to start my last report. Through the open door I could hear Shift Lead ask Tech1 if they had done the specific analysis. Tech1 said no and that they thought I was doing it. Shift Lead said no and that my job for the day was to be in the office and they (Tech1) was supposed to handle it. I can hear Tech1 get flustered as they stomp around to the machine and get started on the analysis. Shift Lead comes back in the office, shaking their head.\n\nA week later another tech asked me about the incident. After I had told them they smirked and said Tech1 had made it sound like I was slacking off and not doing my job, among other things. That got me heated since Tech1 had been told at least twice I would not be there to help. So I went to my supervisor and relayed what I had heard. Supervisor nodded and said they were already aware, that I was not in trouble, and they would be dealing with Tech1 mistake during their performance review. I heard from the grapevine the review did not go well.\n\nSince then Tech1 has been a bit more on the ball and I see them checking the task board every day.",

        "text": "I used to work for a company that had multiple mini offices all over the country, which as the central IT function we had to support as best we could. Sometimes, this meant actually having to visit the site.\n\nWhen I first joined, there were a bunch of \"pool\" cars available for these visits - usually anyone with a company car had them on a 3 year lease. If the person left the company before those 3 years were up, it was cheaper to keep hold of the car and use it for ad hoc requests until the lease term was up.\n\nThis worked absolutely fine, until our parent company decided to take more of an interest in the day-to-day running of the company, rather than just owning us and being happy to take all our profits as they had previously done.\n\nThis resulted in an edict that all leased cars were to return to the leasing company upon that staff member leaving - regardless of the early contract break cost - to save money. I wasn't directly involved in this part, but I heard that some that only had six months to run, say, cost the company nearly twice as much to cancel early than it would have done to pay the remaining months on the lease.\n\nThis meant that we no longer had pool cars available. Two options were presented to us - we could add \"business use\" to our own personal cars'  insurance policies, and the company would pay for the extra cost on the insurance, and 45 pence per mile driven for the company.  \nOr - they would get us a hire car. For the first trip I did, I chose the latter option. They gave me a top of the range Volvo saloon. Absolutely lovely place to soak up motorway miles. I just had to claim the fuel costs back on expenses, not as convenient as the fuel cards that came with the pool cars, but it was usually fine.\n\nI then realised I'd made a massive mistake. My car is a hybrid, that gets great mileage. It can do 400 miles on the 30 litre tank, at the time, roughly £35 to fill up. I worked out that for every £35 tank I drove, the company would pay me back £180.\n\nI started volunteering for trips to the most remote offices. Not only was I making that money back in mileage allowance, but every hour driving was being paid as well - and every hour over my normal 8 a day was at time and a half, double time on Sunday. You better believe I had to drive to Edinburgh from Southampton on a Sunday so I could be there first thing Monday morning to fix their issue. Yes I had to go to Manchester on a Tuesday evening. And Peterborough. And Newcastle. \n\nAfter a particularly long stretch of roadworks around Birmingham on one trip, I realised that if I stuck to 60mph instead of the 70mph limit, I got even better mileage, and the company never once commented that I was taking longer to get places. My car told me I was getting nearly 70 miles to the gallon, and being paid an absolute fortune for doing so.\n\nAll in the name of cost-saving.",

        "text": "First and foremost this isn't my story, it is my friend's, but it was too good not to share. \n\nAt the end of May this year he needed to move out of his shared house because the lease ended. All of his roommates were also moving out because all of them had graduated from school and were happy with letting the lease expire naturally. These roommates had lived in that house for about four years with the occasional roommate change, but overall most of the final renters were the original renters, so as to be expected a lot of junk and large items had accumulated over the years. \n\nMy friend had only lived there for the last year but spearheaded most of the moving out effort- organizing the cleaners, taking care of cleaning out all the spaces, making sure most of the big furniture items were out of the house before they left, that sort of thing. One of the agreements was that the roommates that had trucks would help transport the larger, left-over furniture to be donated or tossed (dependent on the condition). This was communicated and agreed upon before the end of the month and moving out. \n\nWell, because this sub is what it is, that is not how it went. One of the roommates with a truck left without any warning. He moved out, took everything he owned and wouldn't reply to any attempt to contact him until my friend called him out in a public forum and forced his hand. \n\nAt this point he made it very clear that he didn't want to help with any form of moving out. He was gone and he was done. Whatever they did was their own problem and he had no obligation to them and was fine leaving their time as roommates on bad terms. \n\nFine. \n\nThey made do and managed to get help and find ways to move the things they needed help moving without him. But, remember, he had made it very clear that he wanted nothing to do with moving out anymore. He was gone and it was their problem. \n\nWhat was also their problem? \n\nAll of the equipment from the cable company that was in *his* name.  \n\nFor years the cable and internet bill had been in his name and the appropriate equipment had been given to the house *under his name*. \n\nBut he didn't want anything to do with moving out and he had already taken everything he cared about. \n\nMy friend took him at his word and just tossed all the equipment, throwing it out with everything else they didn't want to keep. Now, I don't know much about cable and internet because it has never been my personal problem, but I do know that if you have equipment rented to you from a certain cable company they can be little bastards trying to get it back and/or getting appropriate compensation. \n\nBut he said it wasn't his problem at the time, and it most definitely wasn't theirs! In the trash it all went and he didn't have to deal with moving a single thing from their shared house! \n\nEdit for update 8/11/18: I'm sorry everyone, I held out as long as I could but I don't think there is going to be an update on this. My friend blocked the offending roommate because of how put-off he was by their last interaction and now that everything has been finalized with their security deposit I don't think the other roommates will be in contact that much. If I do get another update, I'll be sure to post here though! ",

After a few years, I was moved onto the recently-created geek-squad knockoff that paid $2/hr more. \n\nWhen they created the department, they hired a new tech supervisor who had owned his own shop, but it had failed. He'd never worked retail, but seemed like he at least knew repairs. That was good, because I was completely new to it. Zero experience whatsoever (outside of my own computer). Naturally, I was the new main tech. \n\nWell, part of the department creation was to convert a section of the store (previously *just* used for general office/store supply storage) into a workbench. Unfortunately, there was only enough space for 2-3 computers at a time, and the rest were all to be placed elsewhere until they could be repaired. \n\nWhen the first official day of this service kicked off, there was a surprising amount of demand for it (our location was right next to a retirement community). I think 20 or so laptops came in, several of them extremely nice, as well as 10+ desktops. We quickly ran out of space. The intake guys were setting them all on various shelves behind the bench. They were promising a 3 day turnaround on them, per corporate - they really wanted us to be churning these things out. \n\nNow, part of my old job was to set up and take down displays. I knew how much the shelves held, I knew how to tell if they were overloaded, and I knew how to fix them. It wasn't hard. These shelves were overloaded. They still had the supplies, and now they had a bunch of computers on them. To top it off, several of the supports were broken or missing - they'd probably been scavenged to repair product shelves in the store. \n\nI had started unloading them and was searching for any extra supports to repair the shelves when my new supervisor, completely freaked out, yells at me - \"you're not paid to fix shelves, you're paid to fix computers. Get back on them. I'll fix these.\" Seriously. He yelled. One rush was enough to send him into a panic - that's how new he was to retail. However, I was pretty jaded already, and I figured that if he wanted me reparing computers that badly, so be it. I left him to it, and started running the \"repairs\" (seriously, it was just plugging in a flash drive and running a program that ran a bunch of utilities). \n\nAbout 20 minutes later, I heard a crash. Then, a second later, I heard a second crash. The top shelf had given way, then taken the middle shelf with it... along with all of the customer's computers. \n\nThis dude had tried to duct tape the shelves. Duct tape. Instead of 3 undamaged supports, they had damaged supports and some fucking tape. \n\nI don't know what the final tally was - probably a few thousand dollars in damages. I didn't care. He asked me to make the calls, but I fought hard on that one - I had tried to prevent it. He caved and did it himself, though I still caught a lot of the fallout from the customers. \n\nThe GM came calling to find out what happened, but I chose not to sell him out. Told him the shelving unit failed, that's all. No one got in trouble. Supervisor got more used to a retail environment, chilled out *a lot*. Eventually got hired at another place making way better pay and actually brought me over with him.\n\nSo yeah. No epic revenge in this one, just probably a few grand worth of damages and some pissed off customers.\n\n",

        "text": "This happened today and I'm a bit upset about it. I work in a very successful and busy chip truck. Me and the boss have never had issues before, she's actually been really great about me finding a job and helps me out with my side projects. Because I love working for her I always come in 30\\-45min early and can stay upwards of 20min after my shift, never expecting to be compensated for my time (I also don't take the mandatory 30min break after 5 hours of working). In exchange, I normally eat 1 hotdog every shift. Needless to say, she's getting a pretty good deal, but i love the work and the people.  \n\n\nWell, today that kind of changed. She's cracking down on the food being eaten and told me that there will be no more free rides. All food must be paid for while you're on shift, but we all get 50&amp;#37; off. A little frustrating because I know the hotdog we sell for 5$ costs her a little under 1$ to buy. So when the 50&amp;#37; off is applied to the 5$ hotdog, she's still making a good 1.50$ on me.   \n\n\nThis is where the malicious compliance comes in. Last year she told me she makes no money on the halibut and chips because the halibut is so expensive. As a courtesy to the customers, we sell the halibut at cost (or maybe 1\\-2$ profit on 25$ order). You can probably guess by now where the malicious compliance comes in. Now instead of eating the hotdog during my shift, I wait till the end of the shift where I'm starving, order 25$ worth of fish and chips and get it for 12.50$. A total loss of about 10$. It's not much and when we make 1\\-1.5k in a day, it's really nothing. But that's 50$ a week, and well over 500$ over the course of the summer. \n\nEdit: Forgot to mention! I’m also no longer going in early for my shift and if she needs me for another 15min, damn right you’ll be paying me for that 15min. No more volunteered time. (Still may work the 30min break though because she does pay me for that time).",

        "text": "TlDr at the bottom, sorry for formatting I'm writing on the phone. English isn't my first language so sorry for any errors or bad grammar in general. \n\nThis happened during last night and this morning and thought I would share it with you guys! \n\nI live in an urban area with several apartment complexes and maybe only 1 parking spot for every 6th apartment, meaning it's very hard to get a spot. Now both me and my roommate (RM) are motercyclists so normally we can just park in the designated MC parking spots without a hassle. Unfortunately (but awesomely) this year a lot more bikes have appeared meaning these spots have filled up as well. I get home late which means I can rarely get a spot. To prevent this RM and I decided that, since he's home most of the day and rarely drives, he would place his MC in one of the regular spots making room for me (so we take up one spot together).\n\nHere's where the trouble starts. Where I live MCs are considered \"cars\" and therefore all the rules for cars applies for MCs - including parking rules! Unfortunately not all car drivers know this and thinks MCs can just park on the sidewalk or, if there, in the designated spots. Cue angry lady (AL for short):\n\nI'm getting home from school and am pulling in to the space next to RMs bike. \n\nAL stoppes behind me and rolls down the window.\nAL: \"*What are you doing?!*\"\nMe looking confused at her: \"*What?*\"\nAL yelling:\"*YOU CAN'T PARK THERE!*\"\nI'm rolling my eyes realising what this is about.\n\"*Actually bikes can park in these spots eventh..*\"\nShe cuts me of and just yells \"*ITS ILLEGAL!*\" as she drives off. \n\nHere's where the malicious compliance comes in because **technically** we are parking illegally - not because we are in the \"car spots\" but because you aren't allowed to be more than one vehicle in one spot (do you see where I'm going?). I was just about to tell her this (plus the fact that there aren't anymore room for us at the MC spots) thinking she might appreciate that we are parking illegally instead of legally, but she just had to cut me off. \n\nWell it so happens that I'm in my exam period meaning I don't have to go to school if I don't want to. So today I got up a little late went down and moved my MC to one the now free spot next to RM bike, so that I won't be parking illegally anymore. To bad I can't see her face when she sees how we're now taking up to spots. \n\nI feel a little bad for the other drivers though. \n\n**Tl;Dr** I park illegally to save space, lady says I can't do that so I park legally instead and takes up more space.\n\n**Edit:** Spelling. Sorry about the headline guys. ",

        "text": "A few years back, I worked retail for a big box store that was mostly general goods but had a grocery section, and an obsession with the color Red. This retail store also has a policy of pulling floor staff up to work the registers when it's busy, and it's a mandatory policy. \n\nAt the time of this incident, there was a new front end manager (We'll call her L) and a new Guest Experience Manager (We'll call him T) both of whom were ready to lay the law and wield what little middle management power they could in the perpetual absence of the pay check collection store manager.\n\nThe precursor to my own MC incident was a day like any other, when the call came out needing assistance at the registers. I was reasonably free at the time, and had a second person in the grocery department with me, so I responded. After about 10 minutes, the rush ended, the regular cashiers had lines under three, and I turned off my light so I could go back after my final person in line. No more than 30 seconds later, L comes over and snaps my light back on, and tells me \"You can leave when the rush is over.\" To this, I turned my light off again and, having no other people in line, left while saying \"The rush is over, there's 3 or less people in all other lines.\"\n\nLater that day, I get pulled into T's office and get told the gem that makes my MC possible. \"You can't leave the register until the FE Manager says you can. They are the ones who judge when the rush is over, and they will turn your lane off when you can go.\" This statement is coupled with a Disciplinary Form which he and I both sign, that includes the stated policy in the notes.\n\nFine.\n\nCue 2 weeks later, in grocery, stocking a freezer. Call for cashiers. I'm by myself in Grocery, no one else there. Second Call. Third call specifically asks for me in grocery. I go over the Walkie and say I'm by myself. T responds that &lt;Person&gt; from &lt;Department&gt; will cover grocery.\n\nFine.\n\nGo up, work the register for about 10 minutes until rush slows down. Continue working register. Continue working while L goes on break. Continue working Register while other dedicated cashiers have no line, and are doing display stocking around the registers. Continue working Register until 1.5 hours have gone past and finally L comes over and turns my light off and says, with a shit eating smirk, \"Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you to go back.\" I head back to grocery, and the 3/4 pallet of now thawed meats, seafood and dairy is still where I was forced to leave it.\n\nFine.\n\nI take it back to the damage out location, log it, and go about the rest of the day. As i'm about to clock out, I get pulled into T's office. Again. This time to discuss how I destroyed company property through Negligence and that there would be a meeting with HR the following week to discuss how I would be covering the cost of damages, and my potential future employment.\n\nFine.\n\nSpend the next couple of days creating a log of events that can be fully supported by the wealth of cameras that are on the front end,  in addition to copies of the signed disciplinary form with the policy that I followed, and a written Notice of resignation, with stated reason for doing so (Just in case). Enter HR Meeting, T says I am liable for the lost inventory and that the plan is to garnish wages to the tune of $2500. I place the log of events and copy of disciplinary form in front of HR, and say nothing. She reads both documents, while T is still trying to impress upon me that I'm screwed. After a few minutes, HR lady looks at T and says, \"He was following policy that you established that L was negligent in executing. I'll discuss this SM when he gets in,\" sends me on my way.\n\nNothing gets Store Manager in a worse mood that when his earnings are hurt by product loss, and when he has to actually do his job.\n\nTL;DR: Managers do power play bullshit, try to blame me for the fallout, get slapped with the CYA/Compliance stick.\n\n\nEDIT, FOLLOW-UP EDITION: The after isn't nearly as interesting, but people have asked, so here it is. T pretty much  was exactly as big of a dick as he could be from that day forward, and we had a pretty tame rules dance around each other for a few months until I got out of there. All of the FE managers had to go to a training session about propper procedure for pulling floor staff to the registers, and a new 20 minute maximum was put in place, that L abused everytime I was up there. I don't think that L and T were in it together, they are just both shitty bosses, and when things happened, T was a complete dick and was trying to cover his own ass in regards to store manager, who was a terror on the rare occasion he actually showed up. As far as I know, neither of them was \"encouraged\" to pay for it. And the world turned onward.",

        "text": "This is a story that happened over a decade ago, but my girlfriend thought this is a perfect MC story.\n\nI used to be a delivery driver for a chain pizza restaurant.  One of a driver's responsibilities is to fold pizza boxes.  So I get back from a delivery and just sort of chill out until my next delivery.  I'm not doing anything but sitting on my ass.  I usually fold boxes, but I think we had enough already folded to last the night.  My store manager comes into the back room and catches me not really doing anything.  We get into an argument about me slacking off.  We get pretty heated.  I am totally in the wrong and I get that.  But as a final F U to me, my store manager tells me to go fold boxes.\n\n\"You want me to fold boxes?  Oh I'll fold boxes.\"\n\nOutside of the restaurant we have a metal storage container.  Like the ones that go on those container ships.  We store all of our paper products there like paper plates, napkins, paper cups, and boxes.  Our boxes come unfolded shink-wrapped in packs of fifty.   We just got our Thursday night shipment in and my boss went HAM on the ordering.  We probably had like 20 packs each of Large and Medium size boxes.  The day was Thursday and my store manager had Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off.  He would come in on Monday night to do inventory.  So I had a plan.  He wants boxes.  I'll give him boxes.\n\nSo I get to work.  After every delivery, I go straight to the shed and fold.  I fold fast.  Whenever the store needed boxes, I'd take a stack of folded boxes in and get right back.  Other drivers would come to the storage container, but I tell them I got this.  One of the other drivers asked why.\n\n\"Store manager told me to fold boxes.  So I'm folding boxes.\"\n\nHe took a peak back in the shed and it was half full of boxes.  Floor to ceiling stacked and no space in between.  He started laughing his ass off.\n\nSo Monday rolls around and after a weekend of straight folding pizza boxes, I'm nearing the end of my task.  I have sooo many cardboard papercuts, but I believe it is going to be worth it.  Monday is slow so I can really concentrate on my task.  The storage container is completely full of pizza boxes stacked floor to ceiling.  If you wanted to get in for anything, you'd have to start taking stacks of pizza boxes out.  So I move my project inside the store.  Any shelving with empty space got pizza boxes.  Any empty flat surface got pizza boxes stacked to the ceiling.  The shift manager thought it was hilarious so he didn't stop me.  All boxes were folded near the end of my shift.  So I just sat on my ass.  Then I go home.\n\nWhile I'm chilling at home I get a call from the store.  It's the store manager.\n\nSM: \"Did you fill the storage full of boxes?\"\n\nME: \"Yes I did.\"\n\nSM: \"Why the hell did you do that?\"\n\nME: \"You told me to fold boxes.\"\n\nSM: \"You asshole!  I have to inventory those.\"\n\nThat fact did not occur to me until that moment.  It's easy to count boxes when the majority of them are in  unfolded stacks of fifty.  Corporate is very anal about the pizza box count in the store because one box equals one pizza.  They believe if 1 box is missing, that means someone probably stole a pizza.  If a stack of boxes are missing, then there is a lot of internal theft in the store.  So my store manager has to count every single box I folded which was well over a thousand.  You might think this would be easy because you take the count of one stack and multiply by how many stacks you think are there.  Wrong.  The storage shed has other things in there too so I couldn't always do a floor to ceiling stack.  Plus large and medium boxes were folded.  The box stacks were stacked so tight together, you couldn't see past a row of stacks.  You have to dig in to see what was there.\n\nWhen I saw my store manager the next time, he said I don't have to fold boxes anymore for the rest of my career.  One upside was that nobody had to fold boxes for almost 2 weeks.  The drivers were thankful.\n\nTL;DR:  My boss tells me to fold pizza boxes as a way to end an argument.  So I fold every single box available over 3 days.  He gets pissed when he has to inventory the boxes (1000+).  I never have to fold boxes again. ",

        "text": "My wife worked at the central switchboard for a group of resort hotels in a tourist area. She had to deal with guests from all of the resorts for all sorts of requests. A lot of them were fine, but there was always a certain percentage of entitled vacationers that seemed to think a good reputation for guest service meant that they could get anything they want. \n\nSometimes it didn’t matter what you did to help the guest, they weren’t going to get what they wanted. This usually involves long angry rants about how horrible of a person you are and how the company is clearly going downhill if they can’t provide what ever they want, whenever, and at little to no cost. It was pretty par for the course when dealing with angry guests. What guests didn’t know was that there was one line they should never cross... threats of legal action. \n\nHere is where the malicious compliance comes in. Any time someone threatens to sue or call their lawyer, there is only one move the operator can do. Direct all conversations to the legal department. \n\nThe operators literally have a script that says “Since you have threatened legal action, all further inquiries must be sent by your lawyer through our legal department.\" At that point, the caller’s account is flagged in the computer system and any anyone else they talk to will give them the same response.\n\nMost of them realize after hearing this, how screwed they are. Want to make dinner reservation? Lawyer.  Room Service? Lawyer. Bell Service? Lawyer. Valet parking? Lawyer. Spa Appointment? Lawyer.  Any other hotel related service across all of the resorts this company owns? Have your lawyer call our legal department. I think it isn’t just phone calls.\n\nI’m sorry, you don’t actually have a lawyer and it is Friday night?  Have the one you hire call us when the legal department opens on Monday morning. \n\nThese hotels are part of a much larger corporate entity, with a massive potential for liability in terms of money extracted under legal threat. To the point that there are scams on a semi-regular basis by people faking or intentionally injuring themselves for personal enrichment. The company is very profitable and has a sizable, well experienced, in-house legal department. No one will serve them beyond what is the minimum level of service out of caution that it may expose them and the company to further liability. ",

One of which is the fishing merit badge. One of those requirements are to catch a fish. Another is to cook a fish. At my scout camp, there is a small container thing that is used as an artificial pond to store fish that have been caught to be cooked. \n\nAlright, let’s begin. One scout in my group, lets call him Bob, was taking the fishing merit badge, and most not have been catching any fish to get the requirement signed off, and saw a dead fish in the pond mentioned earlier (my understanding is a scout had his phone, which he shouldn’t have had, was in an area he was almost certainly not supposed to be in, saw a plug, which he was definitely not supposed to touch, unplugged it to charge his phone, it was the oxygen pump for the pond, which without it, the fish died, kid from my understanding did not return to claim his phone while I was still there at least, a few days later at that), and so Bob, asked the merit badge counselor if he grabbed that fish, would it count for the catching the fish requirement. Scout counselor, doubting he would do it, says yes. And so Bob, obviously since I’m posting it here, grabbed the fish. I think said counselor did give him the requirement but I could be mistaken. ",

        "text": "I used to work for a grocery store that's got different brands under it's banner nationwide. I only worked for this store after the store I'd been working for closed up shop in my smallish college town, so I had ten years of grocery experience and knew the state labor law policies.\n\nNow, my new store had a policy that they would call for cashier back up help from the peripheral departments (Produce, Frozen, Grocery, Non-foods) when they'd get a bit of a rush. The plan worked in theory but was highly exploitable by the front end managers who would call us up for every little transaction as long as they didn't get more than two people waiting in a line to not mess up their precious checker numbers.\n\nI wasn't overly fond of being a cashier, but it was policy so I did my best to be a decent cashier as I could with only minimal training and haphazard timing of it.\n\nPart of this policy was we couldn't refuse to respond if called, and they wanted you up front within 90 seconds of the initial page which again, is fine, I wouldn't want customers standing at empty registers for extended periods of time either, and I actually really liked helping people out.\n\nNow the front end had highly regimented breaks for their fifteen minute breaks and for bathroom breaks so that they had enough people in theory to help customers.\n\nBeing in produce, I had no such regulations as long as I took my lunch break about halfway through and no later than working 6 hours straight, 15 minute breaks I was allowed but rarely had time to actually take and bathroom breaks happened as needed.\n\nOne day, nature called, so I went in and began contemplating quantum theory and I hear over the PA system \"Death By Suplex to check on Register 6, Death By Suplex to Register 6\" now at this point I was fully invested in my hypothesis and really couldn't stop until it was properly thought out, I don't tend to theorize long but I was well over the 90 second ideal time. Again they paged me, and as I was washing up my hands they paged a third time. I quickly went to the register which had a rather nice lady just standing there (note there were two full time cashiers now standing doing nothing, but that's another rant) I approached apologized explaining that I was in the midst of contemplation and I got there as soon as I could. The lady understood and I helped her out and turned off my register light starting to head back to my department.\n\nThe front end manager was glaring at me a bit, but didn't say anything. About five minutes later the Store Director (SD) comes storming back.\n\n\nSD: I was told you took too long to respond to a cashier call.\n\n\nMe: Nature called, sorry.\n\n\nSD: That's unacceptable.\n\n\nMe: Excuse me? Are you saying I can't take bathroom breaks when I need them?\n\n\nSD: Well you could use better timing.\n\n\nMe: I mean I went before we hit the big rush, I'm not psychic I don't know when the front will call me up.\n\n\nSD: Well from now on you need to inform the Front End every time and where you are.\n\n\nMe: You want me to tell the front end when I'm going to the bathroom?\n\n\n\nSD: Yes.\n\n\nMe: Okay.\n\n\nNow oftentimes the front end is busy helping customers or directing them to open lanes and even in down time they are having conversations with coworkers so they are rarely not in the midst of a conversation when I have to inform them of my where abouts, so I went full potty training toddler with it.\n\n\n\"Going potty!\"\n\n\nWhen I was done.\n\n\n\"Just got done going potty!\"\n\n\nThis lasted for another two weeks before another incident happened and they no longer could call us up to check, but they couldn't really say anything because I was just doing what I was told and wasn't being vulgar about it.\n",

        "text": "I was inspired to post this story after reading a post about racist customers asking for the best salesmen being served by said salesmen, who just so happened to be ethnic origin.  This happened last year, so some details will be rather fuzzy.  \n\nI'm currently studying in Australia.  My school's quite diverse - there are quite a few international students, coming from a wide range of backgrounds.  While I myself am an Australian citizen (and thus am technically a local student), I act more like an international student due to being raised overseas, and usually hang out with the other internationals.  I also occasionally serve as a translator due to English being one of my mother tongues.  \nAlthough most of our schoolmates are quite accepting, there were always one or two racist assholes.  This story is about my friend (who I'll call S) shutting one of aforementioned assholes down.  \n\n\nS was an international student from northern China.  Although she spoke English with a slight accent, it was still perfectly understandable, and she also understood English pretty well.  However, she was far more eloquent in Mandarin, her mother tongue.  Even though S and I only had PE together, we were practically inseparable, especially during those lessons.  That was partially because I could understand Mandarin, as well as speak it somewhat.  It was during those lessons that we helped each other with our respective languages - I helped her with English, while she helped me with Mandarin.  One day, she comes up to me during break with a worried look on her face.  \n\nS: \"Lux, I need your help.\" \n\nMe: \"Hey S!  What's going on?\" \n\nS: \"There's a girl that keeps saying that my English sounds terrible and that my accent makes it difficult to understand me, and she keeps telling me she doesn't want to hear it.  Is she right?  Is my accent really that bad?  Can you help me get rid of it?\"  \n\nMe: *scowls* \"Let me guess.  Is it [Mean Girl in our PE class]?\" \n\nS: \"Yeah, how did you know?\"  \n\nMe: \"Can't say I'm surprised.  She does that kind of thing a lot.  Also, just disregard what she said - your accent's perfectly fine.\"  \n\nS: \"Are you sure?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  She's just being mean.\"\n\nS: \"Oh, is she?\" *smirks* \"We'll see about that.\"\n\nMe: \"What are you going to do?\" \n\nS: \"Nothing much, I'll just give her what she wanted.\" *walks off*\n\nMe: \"...?\"\n\n\nSeeing as we had PE later that day, I decided not to press the matter, instead opting to see what would happen.  Before class starts, S comes hurrying over to me.  \n\n\nS: \"Just a heads up, when I swap to Mandarin, there's no need for you to swap as well this time - just reply to me in English and make sure Mean Girl (MG) can hear you.\" \n\nMe: *blinks, then grins* \"Sure.\" \n\n\nThe lesson starts.  We split off into groups to do basketball passing drills, with Mean Girl's group next to me and S's group.  Soon enough, MG starts insulting S, until... \n\n\nMG: \"Ugh!  What's wrong with your English, S?  Can't you speak English properly?\" \n\nS: *feigning confusion* \"What's wrong with it?\" \n\nMG:  \"Your accent!  It's so thick, it makes it hard to understand anything you say!  In fact, it's not just your accent - your English is terrible!  I don't want to hear it!\"\n\nS: *in Mandarin* \"Sure, no problem!\"   \n\nMG: \"Huh?\" \n\nS: *in Mandarin* \"You told me you didn't want to hear my terrible English, so I'm speaking in Mandarin!\" \n\nMG: \"What the fuck?  Dude,  I can't understand a damn thing you're saying!\" \n\nMe: *trying not to fall over laughing* \"She said she's doing what you asked her to.\" \n\nMG: \"What do you mean, 'doing what I asked her to'?  And why the fuck are you speaking Chinese?  Change back to English!\" \n\nS: *in Mandarin* \"Huh?   But you said you didn't want to listen to me speaking English...\" \n\nMe: \"Eh, thanks for your concern MG, but it's fine.  It's not like we can't understand each other.  Hey S, catch!\"\n\nS: *catches the ball, then tosses it back*  \"Hey, this is fun!  Can we keep doing this for the entire lesson?\" \n\nMe: \"I think Miss has other things planned as well, so probably not.  But yeah, this is fun!\" \n\nMG: *getting increasingly confused and flustered* \"But– I– what– how– argh!\" *gives up and stomps back over to her group* \n\nMe: *waits until she's gone* \"So, wanna see how many passes we can make in a minute?\" \n\nS: *swaps back to English* \"Heck yes!\" \n\nMG never bothered S about her accent again.  \n\n**TL;DR**: Racist girl claims not to understand classmate because of her (almost non-existent) accent and tells her that she doesn't want to listen to her speaking English, classmate swaps to another language instead.",

        "text": "I used to work at a popular wholesale store that we will call Sam's Club, because that is it's name.  I was one of the few trained forklift operators on duty.  I was told to take 2 pallets of water out the front of the store for a customer pickup.  This customer pulls up to receive the pallets in a full size F150 or similar pickup.  I put the first pallet in the back of his truck, and the pallet of water sank the bed of the truck down to the bottom of the suspension's travel.  I asked him if he was sure that he wanted the second pallet, or if he wanted to take the first pallet and come back for the second.  This customer insisted that he get his 2 pallets of water.  I retreived the second pallet, drove back to his truck and again asked if he was sure he wanted the second pallet.  He assures me that he takes 2 pallets of soda all the time.  I told him that soda weighs a LOT less than water.  I was instructed to stop stalling, and put the water in the truck.  As carefully as I could, I placed the second pallet as far forward on the forks as I could, and used it to push the first pallet further into the bed of the truck.  I then slowly lowered the second pallet down into the pickup truck bed, giving this guy plenty of time to call me off.  Nope.  Down it went until the suspension gave way.  I told him to have a nice day, and drove the forklift back into the store.  He was still there when my shift ended, and I never heard another word about it.",

        "text": "I [posted previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8gqgau/oh_you_want_us_to_ship_you_our_unused_computers/?st=ji7bwytx&amp;sh=e46f17fa) about shipping unused laptops to a new office that was being opened by our parent company on the West Coast, and I was told to equip new users for that office with any unused computers we had (4+ year old systems, some of them big huge engineering jobs with huge power bricks, etc).\n\nIts been a little over a month now that I've been doing that.  They've hired 6 people for that office and one for the development office, and in all but one instance, the request for the new hire ID and hardware came in on Thursday or Friday, with a following Monday start date. \n\nWhen the first of these came in, I knew where this was going to go from an \"expectation management\" standpoint. If I move heaven and earth to make their unrealistic goal, then that becomes the norm for them and they'll never stop expecting it.  I told my management \"Look, I'm not a miracle worker here, these demands are shorter than the IT SLAs we have in place. I can't turn around a PC in less than a day to get in sent out. Plus shipping to the West Coast is expensive if they're going to ask for things to be overnighted.\" \n\nI was rebuffed and told \"Do what you can for them. This is a priority.\"\n\nClearly, our senior executives don't want to push back against the leadership in China, and they expect me to somehow bend the laws of physics to make someone's fantasy a reality.  \n\nOK, you're about to get everything you asked for.\n\nFirst, when one of these requests comes in that doesn't meet the SLA, I reply to the requestor  something like \"This request for service has a due-by date that is less than our published SLA. I will do what I can to meet that date, but there may be delays or costs associated with attempting to meet this due-by date\" and I copy the requestor's VP, my VP (I work directly for my VP) and our HR manager.\n\nThe usual pushback is \"Oh, we need this, what is this guy going to do if he's waiting for hardware, do what you can, please expedite\" etc.\n\n(Our published SLA for an ID/email is 48 hrs from request to completion.  I always get it done quicker, sure, but its not \"late\" until 48 hrs.  New user with existing hardware? That's a minimum of 4 days before that PC is on the desk, ready to go. And then shipping to the West Coast.  Got to get new hardware? Thats minimum 14 days *from the day the PO for the hardware is approved* before its either on the desk or ready to be shipped)\n\nSecond, very dutifully I've been doing what I can to fulfill these requests as best I can.  When someone comes in to my office with an IT problem while I'm trying to fulfill these requests, I just smile, nod, and say \"Yep, sorry, priority job here.  You can wait until this afternoon or Monday.\"   They often come back with their manager, demanding better service, but I have to apologize to them that the West Coast office's request has \"priority\" due to the request date, etc.  When the manager realizes he can't push back against China, they give up. To be fair, I do what I can to help them, but I can't do two or more things at once in two or more locations. And I have to get this stuff finished before the truck shows up.\n\nMy company ships our products out via FedEx, and we ship a metric crapton of stuff every day. But the \"Express\" FedEx pickup leaves between 1:30 and 2pm, meaning I have to really bust ass when I get one of these requests in my email at 7:30am on Friday, that was sent by the hiring manager on the West Coast at 1:30 in the morning, to have it in the package stream for a Monday delivery.\n\nI have to get the ID squared away, sync up the user's Office 365 account from on-premise, confirm licensing, pull one of my prepared \"stock\" laptops out, get the user setup, software, VPN, email account in Outlook, email signature, etc, test the whole shebang, throw it in a box and out it goes. Even if I get the request on Thursday, its generally not getting shipped until Friday.  Several times, because its 3:30 or 4pm when the laptop is ready to ship, my shipping people have done the FedEx shipping label but I have to drop it off over at the airport (not far, 10 minutes or so) so that it will get out that night on the plane. \n\nEverything I have shipped to the West Coast so far has gone FedEx overnight. The first time, I sent it \"Standard\" Overnight to save some money (delivery after 3pm local time).  I got a phone call at noon West Coast time from the director complaining that the new employee was sitting around on his thumbs waiting for his equipment to show up. I reminded him that the IT SLA hadn't expired yet and that between the SLA and shipping, it was going to be three more days before it was considered \"late.\"  *click*  \n\nI got a talking to from my VP over that (my VP thinks its bullshit too, but he has zero traction with the people from China to make any change, so he has to go with the flow), and I followed it up with an email to him, our HR and the West Coast director indicating that I would send everything out to those two offices FedEx Priority Overnight, which had a 10:30 delivery time.  (Priority Overnight winds up about $65 a package for box with a power brick and a laptop)\n\nThe West Coast director pushed back and said that since the employees start at 8am, he wanted it delivered earlier. \n\nI reply, copying my VP: \"Per your instructions, I will send *everything* to those offices via FedEx First Overnight, which will give you around an 8am delivery time.\"  I checked with my leadership as to how to account for this shipping, and our CFO and the Finance people all said it should be charged against the West Coast operations. \n\nEvery single package since has been sent First Overnight. I think that winds up being close to $100 per package. \n\n\"We need a docking station for this employee\"  (not originally requested)\n\n\"OK.\" Drops dock &amp; spare brick in a box, First Overnight to the West Coast.\n\n\"This laptop didn't work out of the box.\" (it worked fine when it went in the box, but its a 4+ year old laptop that had already seen two different users in its life)\n\n\"OK, I'll get a replacement on its way to you.\" Drops 2nd 4+ year old laptop into box, First Overnight to the West Coast.\n\n\"We need a printer.\" \n\n\"You should buy one locally, like at Staples or Frys. This model or this model.. it will be cheaper.\" \n\n\"No, ship us one of your printers.\"   OK. Big HP 4240 boxed up by our shipping guys and sent First Overnight to the West Coast. [Where it doesn't work when it comes out of the box](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8lay39/the_phrases_not_my_first_rodeo_and_if_i_had_a/?st=ji7e2o09&amp;sh=61b17c6f).\n\n\"Send up monitors for laptop docks\"  I dutifully box up 10 used monitors we have here.  They're all old 19\" 4:3 format monitors.  First Overnight.\n\n\"These are old monitors.\"\n\n\"You're right. Any new monitors are actually IN USE.\"\n\nEach time I ship something to the West Coast, our shipping request form asks for the cost center to be charged against, and the cost center that Finance gave me goes in the box on the form.\n\nApparently, the West Coast office got the shipping chargebacks from Finance this week.\n\nThe West Coast director lost his shit, called me up screaming at me that he could have bought brand new computers and printers for the amount of money that was spent in shipping.  I asked him to hold for a moment, parked the phone call, pulled the all the emails demanding \"better than our SLA\" service and First Overnight shipping out of my CYA folder, forwarded them to the HR manager, then grabbed my VP and we went upstairs to the HR manager's office, where I unparked the call and asked the West Coast director to continue. But this time, he was on speaker phone. \n\nHe continued to froth at the mouth about how much shipping was, etc and that I had deliberately wasted company resources. He's from the company that owns us in China, but has been seconded to our company so technically he's a US employee.  The best part was when he started swearing at me in English &amp; Chinese. \n\nthe HR manager piped up \"It says here you asked for these things to be shipped for delivery by 8am...\"\n\nThings got very quiet on the other end of the phone.\n\n\"And lets talk about swearing at our employee here, hmmm?\"\n\nHR manager shooed me and the VP out of her office so she could do her thing.\n\nEDIT: tl;dr: Company tries to save money by shipping used equipment, company tries to save time by shipping priority. Receiving end does not listen and insists on their brilliant idea. Receiving end about loses their shit when buying everything new at new location would have been cheaper than their idea. HR listens in on said losing of shit. (thanks to /u/ThatSiming for coming up with it. I suck at tl;drs)\n\n",

        "text": "This is a long one because I think the context/buildup matters, and there is a TL;DR at the end! \n\nThis takes place over the summer break between university terms. I had a really good job lined up for the second half of summer, but I needed something to make rent for the first half of summer. I thought I found the perfect term position at a family\\-run greenhouse. But I soon found out that it was being run by two owners (Owner 1, O1, and Owner 2, O2) who never should have been allowed to operate a business. They were geniuses with plants, but failed miserably at nearly every other aspect of running a business. There were no standardized procedures for anything, training was a joke and disorganized, the permanent employees and the owners all hated each other, the owners were totally unprofessional, and they routinely gave conflicting instructions. I even found out from the bookkeeper that they defaulted on loans and were under audit for not paying taxes.\n\nOn my first day O2 spent maybe thirty minutes teaching me how to water one species of flower. That concluded all of my formal training. O1 and O2 then decided that I could be left alone to manage the entire greenhouse complex in the evening and all day on the weekends. I tried my best for almost a month and used my limited knowledge of plants to keep the crops alive, but the owners expected perfection and would berate me if three plants out of hundreds had dried out overnight. It got so bad that I dreaded both coming to and *leaving* work because I did not know when or why they would yell at me.\n\nSeveral weekends in, I came to work and O1 angrily ushers me into a greenhouse. O1 says, \"WelcomeToRuralMB, you have been here long enough that you should know how to water.\" O1 then walked me around the greenhouse, telling me species names I had never heard before and giving me specific instructions about how each species should be watered (during training O2 told me to water every plant the same way). After the tour, O1 told me people they hired during previous summers did the job better than I could and finished his rant with, \"If you haven't figured this job out by now then you shouldn't be here.\" It's worth pointing out that they were already short\\-staffed by two people at this moment.\n\nWell, I saw my chance to leave this dumpster fire of a workplace and took it. After I got home that day I typed up my  letter of resignation and closed it with, \"Since I can not perform my job correctly, it is in your best interests that I resign immediately.\" The next day I came to work, give O1 my LOR and said it's my last day. That day was probably my best working day at the greenhouse in a month. Both O1 and O2 helped me look after all the greenhouses and actually managed me effectively for once. But it was too little too late and I never returned after finishing my shift that day. \n\nTL;DR: Find a summer job but quickly realize the business is a mismanaged hellhole. The owners give me way too much responsibility and not enough training, and then get angry at me when I inevitably fail. One day an owner tells me that if I can't figure my job out, then I shouldn't be there. So I resign the next day and they're screwed because they are now short staffed by three people and have nobody left to cover the weekends.",

        "text": "Years ago, I used to work in store for a major Telco. I loved the diversity in my workplace from the types of people I would encounter to the different challenges that would arise. Every day was an adventure! \n\nHowever, this particular scenario happened at least once a week, sometimes more. \n\nNow, we all know how frustrating it can be to call outsourced call centers. You know it, I know it, your neighbours cats cousins best friends uncle knows it. Some people though, take their frustrations as a personal affront and are happy to blame an entire culture as a whole for their grievances. \n\nAt the time, I would often work EFM (effective floor managment) which essentially meant meeting and greeting customers, taking their names and finding out why they were in store to ensure they could be served by the most appropriate person. This meant I was front of the firing line when these customers would go on their racial rants. We'll call these people RC. Being that I am a white woman in her early 20s, these customers assumed I would sympathise with their point of view. \n\nHow wrong they were. \n\nMe: \"Welcome to MajorTelco! How can we help you today?\"\n\nRC: \"Those stupid Indian call centers have gone and fucked up my account! I can't understand a word any of them say! This is an Australian company and you lot have those (insert racial expletives here) working for you! It's ridiculous! I want your best salesman to fix this! NOW!\"\n\nMe: \"Absolutely, Sir!\" \n\nWhile I am a Caucasian woman and most of my colleagues were also Caucasian, our 2 best salesman happened to be of ethnic origin. One from Sri Lanka (SL) and another who's parents were from New Dehli (ND). I think you can see where my malicious compliance is going... \n\nSL and ND were both lovely men with a lot of company experience and were, technically, our best salesmen. \n\nMe: \"Sir, this is our most experienced employee, SL, who is more than happy to have a look at your account for you today!\"\n\nRC would often stammer for a moment before begrudgingly following my colleague to their workstation, quickly tucking their racism back in. \n\nOn the few occasions they didn't, the following would happen...\n\nRC: \"this isn't acceptable. I want to speak to an Aussie!\"\n\nMe: \"Oh, of course, Sir. My apologies!\"\n\nFrom there I would go and find ND...\n\nMe: \"ND, we have another one. Enjoy.\"\n\nND: \"hehehe got it!\"\n\nND would then proceed to lay on the most bogan Aussie accent he could and introduce himself to RC. These people would look like their head was about the explode when he said \"G'day, Sir. How's things? What would ya like me to give ya a hand with t'day?\" \n\nIt was glorious! \n\n9 times out of 10, ND would have them sorted and on their way with little hassle. The 10% That held a grudge? Well, I always made sure to loudly wish them a good day with a cheery smile on my face as they left. \n\nTl;Dr\n\nRacist customers ask for our best salesmen. Our best salesmen are of ethnic origin and are exactly who the customer gets!\n\n",

I took a class this quarter with a professor who is serious disorganized. She would do things like not tell the entire class about a particular assignment and then get very upset when her deadline would roll around and zero people turned it in. \nTo make up for the fact that we missed several assignments, she assigned us busywork this week going into the final. One of the assignments she gave us includes the guideline \"answers must be on 1 single spaced page MAX\". This is probably because she's too lazy to read her own assignment with proper answers and just wants to skim them (there's no TA's in this course so she is personally doing the grading).\n\nWell, I finished that assignment and followed the guidelines exactly. The only issue is that my assignment is 14 pages single spaced. So, I did what any hardworking good-willing student would do. I put my answers on 1 single spaced page and included 13 pages as an index. My answers to all of her questions are basically \"refer to index section 1a\" \"refer to index section 1b\". If she fights me on this and says I did not follow her guidelines I'm going to escalate to the dean of my department and at that point it'll be clear why she is assigning busywork week 10. ",

        "text": "My first dog overnight was very, very special- it was a weekend long. As she assumed I had never stayed in a house before with windows, doors, and things like that, my boss generously accompanied me to show me where the key was and where to put it back so that the clients didn't think there was a scary murderer in their house. (It was in a random children's boot outside of the garage, like that looks completely fucking normal).\n\nAnd after that, smooth sailing- they had a nice TV, I loved their pets, and we had a great weekend. Had, being the operative word in this sentence. Clients leave reviews after each walk or service. This is especially helpful because if there's nothing I love more than constructive criticism, it's the ability to receive it up to ten times a day for the task that I perform the same way, three times a week. The feedback started out lovely- the pets were safe, happy, and well-fed. Awesome, I didn't kill anything! And that's where shit got weird.\n\nThere was a photo of a serving fork next to a plate. Initially, I thought I had accidentally broken something, or that one of the dogs had knocked something over, but both pieces were intact. I'll let the lecture I received that morning explain the situation in more detail to you:\n\nScene: my boss is chain-smoking Newports. She's wearing pajama pants and eyeliner from last night, and one of her three Australian Shepherds is taking a huge shit on her front porch. \"Do you see what happened here?\" I do not, and I say so. \"It looks like you left a spot on the fork you used, right there.\" She gestures blindly at the photo, and we both peer to look for a spot that isn't there. I ask if she can zoom in on the spot so that I can see. She ignores me. \"So usually, when we go to client's houses, we try and make sure it looks like we were never there in the first place, so maybe next time that happens you can clean up after you go?\" She smiles. I smell hairspray close to my body. \"I'm not mad at you, and the client is giving you one more chance to sit for them, but we had to give them 20% off their next visit, so maybe next time don't do that.\"\n\nI goggle at her, amazed that she would think that I purposefully sullied a serving fork and pranced around the house, proclaiming that I'd gotten one over these people, and that she would be so stupid and limp as to offer them a discount for three seconds of dishwashing. The mess wasn't mine- I had ordered a pizza and took home my leftover crusts and the box in my car so as not to leave any unfamiliar garbage in their trash can. Based on my gaping expression, she assumed I was unhappy to have been caught in the act. \"So maybe next time don't do that,\" and she patted my shoulder and I went about my day.\n\nI was a regular walker for these people, too, so when I saw them, I was wondering if they were insane or if I could potentially address this directly. No dice, all passive-aggressive, all the time. Until the next overnight. I walked into the house. It looked like a crime scene rendered in spaghetti- dirty pots on the counter, dirty forks and spoons, and lip-smeared glasses. No way was I getting this blamed on me. So in my nightly note, I tagged and bagged the suspects, numbering each dirty kitchen utensil with an itemized description- \"spaghetti smear, 1 3/4 inches in diameter, lower lefthand side of chicken-shaped trivet\", and sent them the photos. No response. \n\nI thought I was clear, until the next day, when I saw my boss. \"You've humiliated me, you're ruining my business\" she said, \"Why didn't you clean their dishes?\" I told her that I was being paid $30 for three nights of sitting (we billed $40 a night, of which we received $10) to walk their dogs three times, clean the cat's litter box, feed them, and watch their house, so, no, I was not going to clean it. The best part is that she wasn't even upset about the itemizing so much as the fact that the dishes were dirty in general, or maybe they never told her- I think it did the trick.\n\nI later found out that the husband of the family was eating late-night snacks off his diet and didn't want to tell his wife. He tipped me for my secrecy and confidence with a nice, hefty pat on the back. Fucker.",

He said that he was only put in charge for the weekend and had no permission to spend money. And that the captain would be back after the weekend. The police left in the end.\n\nNext day the crew was let go.

        "text": "Hi everyone, this is something I just remembered that happened maybe 3-4 years ago. I was working in a local supermarket chain as a cashier. I worked there for maybe 6 months and I can safely say it made me hate anything retail related forever. The customers were demanding and unapologetic about anything and everything. \n\nOn this day I was the cashier for one of the busiest checkout lines in the store. An entitled customer approached me, we'll call him EC for entitled customer, while I was helping a customer, we'll call them C for customer, that had just bought $6-700 worth of groceries and paid me in small bills. EC was next in line; however, even though I was obviously busy counting C's bills, EC insisted that I had to give him change for his $50 bill right then and there. He couldn't wait, it had to be done immediately. I told him I'd do it in a second and that I was counting the change for C. EC found that to be \"rude\" and called me out on it. Unfortunately for EC, I was tired of this job and had not had a good day so far. I flipped out on EC, saying he was the one being rude and oblivious, after all he could clearly tell I was busy. EC was taken back by my words. \n\nUnfortunately for me, the owner of the store was passing by and overheard the conversation. Let's call him DMO for dickmunch owner. DMO talked to me and told me to calm down, berated me for a few minutes about customer service and how I had to react and that the customer was always right. Keep in mind, DMO is paying me $7.25 an hour. I'm not going to sit there and take everything for $7.25 an hour. Since he was so insistent on the customer being always right and to take care of them, I decided to take his words to heart. Whenever a price wouldn't scan, whenever the customer wanted something for free, whenever something wasn't scanning fast enough, the customer would get it for free. From that day forward, the customers would always be taken care off. No idea how much stuff I gave away, but I wasn't paid enough to think and DMO wanted the customers to always be taken care of, so that's what I did. \n\n",

I asked the size of her house, and she said it was only a single-story 2000 square foot house. It told her the price would be $300. She said she couldn't afford that and she actually just needed the back of house pressured washed. I told her I could do it for $95 if it took less than an hour, and $95 for every hour after that. She said I'd definitely be finished in less than an hour and if I could keep going until the hour was up. I said no problem.\n\nWhen I got there, I kid you not, it was a complex. About 6,000 sf according to county records (which I found out later, because I was on the road when I took the call) with multiple rental apartments on 3 different floors. Well, since I was there and getting paid hourly, I had my guy start while the lady showed me wanted she wanted done. She had by this point changed her song that the most she could afford was 2 hours and if I could do the entire house in that time. I told her absolutely not, but we would do the best we could, especially since it would be dark in 2 hours. So I got our second pressure washer and started at the other end of the house from my guy. Well, we stop at 2 hours since it's dark, and pack up our van. I get to the front door, but she's already out looking at our handiwork.\n\n\"I can't believe you didn't finish!\"\n\n\"Ma'am, I told you we wouldn't be able to finish in 2 hours, and that we would do the best we could in 2 hours.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not paying you the full amount.\" She hands me $100.\n\n\"Ma'am, this is unacceptable. We had an agreement.\"\n\n\"You didn't finish.\"\n\n\"I said we wouldn't finish, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Well, come back tomorrow and finish and I'll give you the rest.\"\n\n\"Ma'am, I'm not leaving until I'm paid the full amount for the work I did.\" Her adult son (who's a lot bigger than me) is behind her, so I'm not threatening her - just letting my feelings be known.\n\n\"Well, I'm not paying ahead. You won't come back if I pay ahead.\"\n\n\"Ma'am, you're not paying ahead. You're paying for the work *that was already completed*.\"\n\nShe chews on this for a second, comes back with $50, and says, \"You'll get the rest tomorrow when you come back and finish.\" Then she slams the door in my face.\n\nI knew if I came back the next day, she was going to try to have me finish the entire house (at least another 2 hours) and pay me just the $40 I had already worked for.  So I maliciously complied with her request by taking the unspoken other option:  by not coming back, I was not going to collect the $40 she still owed me.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.",

        "text": "So, this was around mid-60s in a small village, my hometown, here in Norway. My uncle, (around 17 years old at that time) had basically crushed his knee in a work-related accident and had a cast up to his hip. Naturally he was using crutches, but that didn’t stop him from attending a local party taking place at a small community venue.\n\nWhen the party was over, and the attendees where collecting their coats and stuff, someone started a fight. My uncle got accidentally pushed out the main entrance and down the stairs, with three of the guys landing on top of him. He was so pissed, he just started punching whomever he could get a hold on. \n\nTwo police-officers showed up eventually, and remember;  this was a massive drunken fight in the 60s - the police didn’t want to interfere something they had no control over. So they desided to arrest the easiest target; my uncle with a cast up to his hip, who had also lost his crutches in all the commotion.\n\nThey laid him in iron and drove him home to my grandparents. He was so angry he growled all the way home. When they arrived, my grandfather came out to see what all this was about. The police-officers took my uncle out of the car and stacked him on his feet against the wall. One of the officers walked up to my grandmother and handed her the crutches and the keys to the handcuffs. They told her to unlock him when they had left, and return the handcuffs at the policestation the following day.\n\nNow my grandfather was pissed.\n\nHe started swearing at them, calling them horsedxcks *(common expression here in northern Norway)*, telling them to fxck off and other things not suitable even for the internet. They fined him about $10 and left.\n\nThe next day, my grandfather went to the policestation to return the handcuffs and pay his fine. The first thing he met entering the station, was the two officers from the night before. He walked straight pass them and right into the chief’s office. \n\nHe slammed the handcuffs and $20 on the chief’s desk. The chief was a little confused and said: \"You were only fined $10..?\"\n\nMy grandfather replied:\n\n\"Well, I’m not finished talking.\"\n",

        "text": "Story happend around 50 years ago before we had those nice mobile phones. My grandpa was a captain on a ship. Not on sea but on the rivers in mainly Germany - Netherlands - Belgium.\nHe was the captain, and his brother and my grandmum where the rest of the crew. The brothers wife would watch the kids.\n\nHe owned part of the ship and other part was from a  company. Most of the time he was able to pick up freights by himself by asking around harbours and known transport hubs. He was not on a set route like for example ship coals from A to B go back to B empty and return with coals. \nHe would just go where ever somebody was willing to pay him to ship to. If he was away for 4 weeks from his main harbour did not matter cause family was on board anyway.\n\nHe also had a preference for certain routes and would dislike others. He was also rather stubborn (I'll deny that it runs in the family).\nWhen you got to a harbour you would call the company to let know where you was. I \n\nOne day my grandpa did just dad he called the company o let know he delivered the cargo and was in city A. His boss tolld him to go to a city to pick up a freight. But my grandpa would have to go there empty and so not making money (you would only get paid when actually transporting something). Considering he owned part of the ship it would cost him money to go to that city empty. \n\nInstead my grandpa had heard of another freight going somewhere else and had accepted that. He tolld his boss that he was not going there and was going to do his on transport. Boss was pissed, yelled there was and it ended with the boss saying to my grandpa he was done talking and did not wanna speak with him anymore.\n\nSo my grandpa took his transport and left to the other city. And kept doing that for some weeks. Arranging his transports to places he normally never went because he could and knew his boss would be looking for him.\n\nRemember it was 50y ago and grandpa would have to normally call in his location in Europe. Which he did not. The boss was asking around everywhere if they had seen the ship, which they had not because my grandpa was avoiding places he would normally go.\n\nFinally the boss tracked down the ship and went to the harbour. \nIt was busy and the ship was anchored of the harbour wall. Grandpa shop got called over the radio that he had a visitor he ignored it. My grandpa tolld me he could see the boss waving from the wall but just ignored it.\nThe boss in the end had to arrange a motor boat to go to the ship and was pretty mad. \nHe asked my grandpa if he hadn't seen him and my grandpa said shure.\nBoss then asked why did you ignore me?\n\"Well you tolld me you did not wanna speak anymore to me\" \n\nIt all turned out fine. My grandpa had done the correct bookkeeping so the boss got his cut from the weeks. \n\nThe reason my grandpa got his own ship when he was very young and got away with allot of stuff was because he was good at the job and never had personal issues. Cause family. \n\n\nI like my grandpa telling me stories about their life. Helps that my grandpa was and is a rascal and has spend some nights in jail (green bananas where not worth it)",

        "text": "This all happened last year, at a job I loved because it was incredibly easy. I worked part\\-time at a law school, in an office where a truly busy day involved maybe 3 hours of work out of up to ten I'd need to be at my desk. The rest of the time I was free to do whatever I liked, as long as my tasks got done. I had a supervisor for about eight months, but he was fired for lack of attention to detail. Grade entry was a big part of both of our jobs, and he was consistently making typos and failing to correct them. The importance of grade entry will come up again in this story.\n\nAfter my supervisor was fired, we got a temp to fill the position and to cover the hours I wouldn't be there. I was also told by the Dean of the department that I could work as many hours as I was able to until the new full\\-time replacement was hired. These extra hours would be part of the temp's training and I could even get overtime if I worked enough. So I'm happy as can be, and excited to work with this temp. That is, until I meet her.\n\nThis temp was the most completely incompetent person I have ever encountered in a workplace. She was incredibly slow to finish tasks, would ask the same questions again and again, and was extremely dismissive of me. She liked to print out everything, and I do mean everything. We had a highly confidential list of students' names and their ID numbers (confidential for grading purposes) that if people were allowed to see could result in massive problems for the university. She regularly, despite my frequent reminders that we should absolutely not print that document, would print sections as she needed to make edits to the document.\n\nThe university had a pool of temps that they'd contact whenever a position opened up, with the option that the temps could transition to full\\-time if they did a great job. She was convinced that she'd be staying in the job after the temp period was up, despite having the worst computer skills I've ever seen in another person. Because she was temping in a position above mine, but I was training her on many tasks, was very resistant to taking my advice or directions. I once explained to her that we don't save junk mail or spam flyers for the professors, and she brushed me off and went to deliver a stack of junk mail to the Dean, so rudely that another professor noticed and was shocked at how she spoke to me. It didn't bother me that she was rude, as long as the work got done, which I ensured it did.\n\nOver time, she started being more directly hostile to me and taking tasks from me as I was working on them. I had a box of TA reviews under my desk that I needed to organize and index, that one professor had expressly given me to work on. While I was out to lunch, she took the box from under my desk and \"finished\" the task (the professor asked for 1\\-2 sentence summaries, she wrote this professor full letters for each one. With salutation, signature, and date.) The stealing of jobs was annoying because there really wasn't much to do in the office, but I was going to put up with it. The big problem, and the reason for this post, happened when I went away to a conference for a week.\n\nOur grading software was, to put it politely, a piece of fucking garbage. The software was written in the 90's and was incredibly bare bones. Many editing tools were hidden away in weird places, and the software did not actually require you to save anything, it was automatically saved on closing the window. Closing the window prompted a popup asking to confirm that you were closing it, and ask if you wanted to make a backup. Backups were not connected in any way, so editing a backup would not change any other files, so I avoided making backups whenever possible to make sure I only changed the correct document. I showed the temp how to add grades, showed her the popup many times, and told her NOT to make backups. Furthermore, I told her that she HAD to add all grades to the right document, otherwise grades would be missing from the final reports. She smiled her bland smile and assured me that she knew what to do. So away I went.\n\nI got back a week later, and opened my email to find many emails from professors in the department addressed to both of us, with grades to be added to the document. She had not included me on any replies, so I went in to the grade software to check if they'd all been added, and found several that were missing. In addition, I found about eight new duplicates of the original grade file in that folder. I asked her if she entered all the grades, and she told me she had. I told her that I found several that were not entered in the right document, and she told me to stop looking at the grade file because all the grades were entered, and to \"leave it alone.\" Every question I asked her (\"Which document did you add grades to?\" \"How many professors' grades have you added here?\" \"Why did you make all these duplicate files?\") was met with silence and a glare. Finally she put up her hand, turned away from me, and said, \"Do not talk to me anymore.\" My jaw dropped for a few seconds, then I calmed down and complied.\n\nSure, I didn't talk to her anymore. I did, however, send an email to the Dean explaining what had happened, describing the attitude I'd had to deal with from the temp, and expressing my concerns that the grades were incorrectly entered. I was willing to work out the issue with just me and the temp, and not make a report of her incompetence at all. But she specifically told me not to talk to her, so I had no other option. As it happened, the Dean was in a staff meeting with all the tenured professors of the department, and the professor who'd seen the temp rebuff my advice and talk down to me vouched for the things I explained in the email. I got a response within an hour saying that the temp's time in the office was ending and for the final two weeks she'd be there, she would be barred from entering grades. I also got to log even more hours cleaning up the mess she made of our grade files, where I found that on top of entering grades in the wrong files, she'd managed to delete a column of grades entirely from the original document. I fixed this and everything else, without a word to the temp.\n\nOn her last day, she waited until I was away from my desk (but within earshot) to thank a professor for hiring her and for the opportunity, then stomp out of the office without a word to me at all. Oh well.",

        "text": "Really didn't think I'd have another update, but John served up an easy opportunity.\n\nLater in the day after posting [my last story,](https://old.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8l362p/update_i_tried_to_warn_you/) we had another sacred John meeting. Since this one was specific to one project, he asked a few of us that oversee all projects to stick around after.\n\nThis second meeting starts up and John has a stack of papers that he begins to spread out in front of himself. John loves him his papers. He hates meetings I run because I refuse to print out a ton of stuff when I can easily put it up on the projector. This also helps me keep people on task as we are all looking at the same thing at the same time. John likes to keep it all to himself so he has complete control and pretend he has all of the information.\n\nAs fate would have it, John learned a lesson and started reading up on the new policies. The purpose of this meeting was to educate us all on what will be expected of each person on upcoming projects, stating with this brand new project. Effective that day. The problem is, John did not hand out anything for us to read, so we're hanging on his interpretation, which is usually far from the intent of the policy. The only reason I know this is because I had already read through these like I stated in my last post. After a handful of attempts to correct John, he snaps at me and asks if I've even read the section for my position. He had to backtrack quickly when I told him it was printed out and sitting on my desk at that moment.\n\nNext, he starts flipping through a checklist of all of the documents required and steps needed to be taken for each stage per position. It was about 14 pages, and John just keeps saying, \"We have a *lot* to do.\" I'm watching as my colleagues go wide-eyed worrying about the new work load. Wanting this circus to end and prevent unnecessary panic, I fired up the conference room computer and turned on the projector without John even looking up from his papers. I begin navigating to the database of policies and start opening each one John has been discussing. One by one, my colleagues notice this and begin to focus on the screen. John finally notices and tries to regain his dominance by directing me to the things he wants to discuss. Fine by me. People are about to get the real story.\n\nWe're reviewing the checklist and it becomes clear that about 85% of this checklist is either John's responsibility, or requires him to provide information for the rest of us to work off of. The remaining 15% is mostly tasks or documents we all do anyway. A few new things, but they are mostly more thorough versions of the current processes. A few sighs of relief around the table later and John is starting to *really* grasp what all of this means. So what does John do? He goes back to his papers and points out a few tasks that he requires information from me first. \n\n&gt;John: Before I can do tasks X, Y, and Z, I'll need [specific information] from batkevn.\n\n&gt;Me: [Navigate to my network drive, copy several documents, paste into an email addressed to John, and press send] Anything else?\n\nSee, since I had already read all of these during my down time, I began working on my tasks to occupy my time. As I said before, these were not drastically new things, so it barely took me any time at all, and it was helpful for my usual day-to-day tasks. John was out of power plays. I also took a couple moments to email all of these documents to my team so they wouldn't have to go searching (the database is not very good).\n\n&gt;Me: Just let me know when you have A though F done so I can can get the rest of my tasks done, John.\n\nAnd that is the story of why I now have to park one spot further south because John has moved to my usual spot.",

        "text": "Writing on phone; everyone apologizes for formatting, so I'll follow lead, even though I haven't noticed a difference, but I read on mobile. My first post as well, so here goes.\n\nApologies for the length in Advance and if I jump all over the place or don't explain things well. I'll do my best. This is a completed MC and an ongoing issue so there will be more I'm sure.\n\nI work for a very, very complicated system in the government. In this system we are civilians, who are part of a reserve force, who wear green camoflauge, sort of like an Army on the weekends and a federal employee on the weekdays. We get paid not by rank, but by pay grades in the federal system and are still forced to wear our green camoflauge, sort of like an *Army* but without the benefits of say.. Army pay, Insurance, housing, active duty time, etc. We're not happy about it, but taxpayer dollars at work (which of course I have to pay myself on the weekends because I'm being paid and taxed heavily in my civilian capacity.) Anyway to the compliance.\n\nOur job is compliance, it's who we are. Discipline and following orders? **That's us.** Though read any book about any Military in history and there's some micromanaging or overbearing officers who cannot let good people do good things and get stuff done without having to put there stamp and name on it, regardless of what it is. That's this tale. Now I consider myself extremely professional, I do everything above and beyond and keep my guys safe. I may be the guy using what I inspect or fix or my brothers/sisters may so I will do it as best I can and not want distractions or people could get hurt. I am the expert and inspector for all things that go boom and cover thousands of these things. I am only one person, I've done this for nearly 5 years. I teach classes on it, I help others, I work very hard to assist my units that I inspect to have an easier go of it and to get their weapons fixed without hassle. Since it's my job to travel over to each Armory or base and work with the units and check the boom-sticks, I pay heed to my time. I have to inspect each weapon for issues and then have it brought in when I'm not traveling so I can fix it. like a person who goes to the doctor and says \"there MAY or MAY NOT be something wrong with me, find it\" and doesn't say a word again after that to the doctor, and there's thousands of people like this but only one doctor searching for an illness or bad joint. I'm the damn doctor.\n\nNow you can imagine this takes an extremely long time, I've done the math and it takes well over a year to complete all of my units with PT, travel, lunch, 2 short breaks, and user error. That's not including fixing. So my boss decides \"let's try and make this more efficient.\" By screwing with my time card.\n\nDid I mention an Army runs on paperwork? It does. Lots of it. Work orders or no touching a boom-stick. Time sheets or no pay. Everything accounted for or no cookie for little Joker. He wants to know why a unit with over 1000 weapons (and subsystems or support systems and platforms) doesn't only take a week to finish so he says \"no writing admin time for paperwork, I want to know EXACTLY how you spend your time to find the issue\"\n\nI can get behind that, he's trying to find out if I'm napping in the garden when I'm supposed to be digging for mines. No problem.. I thought. So he is determined, I am compliant even after explaining the situation. He is **OB** for overbearing boss and I am **J** for Joker. \n\n**J**: Sir, some of those weapons are stated as being over 2 hours to inspect in the manual, I have them down to less than an hour, this is our largest unit. They have 17 of them. Not to count the thousand other weapons and systems in their arsenal, a Soldiers safety is in my hands. I'm going to do it fast, but correct, and the paperwork will take time and I will get it to you after the end of each week. But if you want it faster please ask PC (production control) to have a vehicle dispatched for the entire week.\n\n**OB**: that doesn't make sense, you have plenty of time, it shouldn't take longer than two weeks with that time frame. And the vehicles are needed elsewhere, I can't have it dispatched all week. I'll do your time card and each day dispatch you a vehicle at the start of the workday. That'll solve this issue.\n\n**J**: Sir, with what I just told you it's 17 working hours for that one platform alone, that's 3 days of work with breaks, travel, paperwork, you trying to learn time, me explaining time, me adjusting for issues, and that's me *rushing* my inspection. Please have a vehicle dispatched for the week and don't change the time, you're adding an hour to the workday with that alone. I can't leave at 0730 if you're dispatching a vehicle then and you yell if I don't leave sir, that's 15 minutes of dispatch! \n\n**OB**: no, we're doing it my way. I started in the ranks, maybe not weapons, but I know what to do.\n\n**J**: Roger, as you say.\n\nI'll do it while wearing a clown nose if you want... I get paid by the hour and need some comp time. I'll even write it in crayon, it's game on. Joker enters the game. \n\nHe makes me wait 15-30 minutes daily before I can get a vehicle, he pawned the issue off on PC. They're rushing. He's chewing me out for not leaving at exactly my start time everyday for weeks. I start doing time how he wants, you want it in detail. I used to write police reports, **detail is my middle fucking name** ... Sir.\n\nOur time sheets have like 30 lines for a week. I fill them up and continue into the 2nd page each week. We're not supposed to even use half the first page, it's a waste. BUT I know he's inputting himself and he won't know what to do. So everyday instead of making it clean and easy to do, I keep a journal of our meetings and what I do separate from the time card as a CYA. I write in the line. I write exactly what I've done. I continue mission. We're talking this as an example..\n**day 1**\n\n*Line 1*: waiting on dispatch. 30 min.\n\n*Line 2*. Travel to unit. Heavy traffic. 1.5 hrs.\n\n*Line 3*. Set up tools and wait on opening of arms rooms. 15 minutes.\n\n*Line 4*. Pull first 5 weapons from rack, check serial numbers. 15 minutes.\n\n*Line 5*. Work on work order # 123. 4.5 hours.\n\n*Line 6*. Travel back to base \n\n*Line 7*. Discussion with OB about distraction from work while stopping work to have discussion about same subject.\n\n*Line 8*. Request vehicle and planning prep, denied. \n\nRather, rinse, repeat. Mother~~fucker~~\n\n....THIS CONTINUES DAILY. For over 6 weeks. He continued inputting time. Mentioning nothing. I'm spending 45 minutes a day on time but I'm not in the office so I don't see him input my time. Easily 3 hours a week in 'meetings.' to ask why I'm not done. Finally I finish the one unit after the first 4 weeks and start another. The man is so stubborn and hard pressed about his micromanaging he accepts this. On week 7 the man passes time keeping and vehicles back to PC, along with my last time card.\n\nProduction control is a good friend. She freaks out. She is PC.\n\n**PC**: JOKER WTF, I've never seen something so ridiculous, why would you do this? It's going to take me hours. We have so many missions and I'm so behind. You could sum this up in less than 10 lines. It's all the same time codes for each thing! \n\n**J**: OMG, PC I'm so sorry that fell on you... (I explain everything)\n\n**PC**: ...he's been killing me with the same ridiculous stuff but for the trucks and how to do my job. He stops work for hours just to talk about why work isn't getting done. I send emails to him while we talk saying \"it's been 45 minutes, I need to continue work\" since saying it in person doesn't work. I can't believe he input this..\n\n**J**: it won't happen again. Btw.. how long does it normally take you to input time? Like mine specifically?\n\n**PC:** idk, maybe 30 minutes at the end of the week.

I could use the comp time.\n\nSorry for the length of the story. \n\n**Tl-dr; overbearing boss in government wastes over a week of his own production time to input my ridiculously detailed time logs because faster than the worldwide stardard is way too slow.

        "text": "Back story: This happened when I was pregnant while in the Navy and got sent to a limited duty station. I essentially worked in an office full of pregnant/injured sailors with a couple supervisors who were absolute dickwads to the pregnant women (because we all got pregnant on purpose to avoid sea duty, of course). I happened to be the most senior pregnant woman there at that time, senior enough to know my rights and to call out bs.\n\nOne of the things we were still required to do is PT  (work out, for you civilians) 3 times a week, within the bounds of our physical limitations. For pregnant women, this typically meant no sit ups, push ups or jumping jacks, no standing/walking for more than 15 minutes, and running at our own discretion. Typically, we were allowed to do our own thing as long as we did some kind of work out (stretching and yoga balls counted), for the 30-45 minute duration. We had requested to be allowed to attend the gym’s pregnancy yoga class, but were denied as it started at 10am (“middle” of the work day, leaving us 30 unproductive minutes before lunch). For the most part, we women were left alone. There were some instances of dick-waving, where the men in charge would decide that all of us, including the women that were 7-8 months pregnant, were able to do whatever hare-brained activity they thought up (like running in the rain). I am typically able to shut those down pretty quick. Needless to say, I wasn’t very popular with our supervisors, but I always had documentation to back me up.\n\nAs I entered my third trimester, my anemia kicked in full gear and I started getting super light headed and having tunnel vision. Regardless, I never called in late, always made it to work on time and did my yoga ball exercises during PT. One morning, I started having tunnel vision and slipped off my yoga ball. As I was sitting there trying to put my head between my legs, someone grabbed my shoulder and started yelling at me to “get off my ass and fucking PT,” along with some other shit about how being pregnant was not an excuse to sit down. Once my vision cleared, I stood up and faced Dickwad, my direct supervisor (LPO), who was still giving me shit. I told him that I couldn’t continue PT and would need to sit out the rest of the time, even producing my medical chit that stated that I was to be allowed to “rest as needed.” Dickwad wasn’t having it, and told me I wasn’t allowed to sit down during PT and that if I wanted to sit, I should go to medical. Cool.\n\nI asked one of the girls to take me to medical, and he started yelling about how I needed to get myself there. I looked him in the eye and said, “I am about to pass out. I am in no condition to drive. If you will not let someone else take me to medical, I am calling the ambulance now.” This would launch an investigation (workplace injury and whatnot) of course, and also involve paperwork for Dickwad to do, so he relented but told me I had to find my own ride back to work.\n\nSo I get driven to medical. I tell the obgyn desk that I had been having dizzy spells and my supervisor wants me to PT. Yes, despite what is said on my medical chit. I get seen by a nurse, get some blood sucked out of me and ushered into the obgyn department head’s office. Apparently he had overheard me. I tell him what happened and the past attempts to force the pregnant women to do more than they are allowed to. Doc asks where we PT. I tell him. He raises his eyebrow. And proceeds to inform me that he is VERY familiar with the particular gym that we PT in, and that it was considered a ‘hazard zone’ for pregnant women as there are a couple basketball courts next to the yoga balls (too close to contact sports), and also that it is in the manual that any command that requires their pregnant women to be involved in any kind of organized PT (making us show up at a certain location at a certain time counts as organized) were required to submit a PT plan for us through the chain of command (this involves going through 3 senior/master chiefs and 4 officers, including our captain) to be approved by the closest affiliated obgyn department head (him) before they were allowed to subject us to any kind of PT. He then proceeded to print out the specific pages of the instruction manual, highlight the pertinent parts, stamp, sign and attach his business card to it and told me to take that to my LPO (Dickwad) and have him call him if he had any questions or would like to show proof of such a PT plan for our command. He then wrote down his private extension on the back of another business card and told me to call him if I have any more problems. He also personally writes me a new medical chit that says that I should be allowed to “rest at member’s discretion and only perform work that member feels that she can safely perform.” (They were having me do things like move heavy boxes of paperwork and test live equipment).\n\nWhile all this was happening, my bloodwork had come back showing stupidly low iron levels, so he had me increase my iron dosage and gave me a week off of work “just to make sure that that solves that problem.” I get taken back to work by medical’s duty driver.\n\nI walk into my office and immediately called into chief’s office to get reamed out for “being late and missing PT.” Apparently Dickwad had failed to inform him that HE had ordered me to go to medical. Dickwad stood in the corner with a shit-eating grin on his face. As chief is giving me the knife hand, I pull out my paperwork from medical and place it on his desk. I then calmly proceeded to explain how Captain OBGYN Department Head would like to see our command PT plan for pregnant women and that he had kindly attached his business card if they had any questions for him. Dickwad read the highlighted portions and went, “You would actually go this far?”\n\nMe: I don’t know what you mean. You told me to go to medical if I needed to sit down, so I did. This is what I was given at medical. Looks like there is Naval instruction related to this that we should be following. Oh, by the way, here is a copy of my new physical limitations signed by Captain OBGYN Department Head and a medical leave for a week. If you don’t have any more questions, I’ll see you next Wednesday.\n\nFrom that day onwards, the pregnant women in my office were allowed to PT any time during the workday that they wished to as long as they did it 3x/week. This meant that we were all now able to attend the 10am pregnancy yoga classes. Amazingly, work production did not go down because we are (surprise!) effective at getting our work done regardless of what time we started. Except now, Dickwad had to do all the heavy lifting and live electrical work until we got someone who did not have such limitations showed up, because the women were all suddenly issued new medical chits signed by Captain OBGYN Department Head, specifically preventing them from doing such things, with relevant Naval instruction highlighted and stapled to their chits.",

        "text": "Background: I am currently a community college student working for a large(global) company trying to get class credit for an internship I am currently on. I will definitely receive credit for it as long as I turn in all the paperwork over the summer. \n\nThis story starts last month when I had to meet with the work based learning(WBL) contact at the community college to ensure all my paperwork was in order before the internship starts. i.e. the internship has to be relevant to my major, and I am a programmer.\n\nThe contact is a program director for a different IT major, we’ll call her PD for short. She states that I must get my new boss, who I have only interviewed with, to fill out some paperwork and turn it in to her so I can get enrolled for the intern credit. Apparently, it is required to go in to meet with her in person when I turn it in. \n\nSo, I email my new boss, NB for short, who seems like a nice guy(understatement of the year) asking him to fill out a few things. He gets back to me a week later with the papers because he was on vacation. No problem for me, I’ll just take them in to PD the next day.\n\nI go in to her office and she proceeds to tell me how I almost missed the window to get enrolled in the WBL credit, which was the day after. I told her I was waiting for NB and even showed her the email chain, but she said I must be more prompt with the paperwork next time. I agree and go on my way thinking to myself she is a power trip cause she’s a director for a gov. organization.\n\nI spent 3 years at a state university so I am familiar with the types of people you often run into in the wonderful world of academia.\n\nThe next week I start my new job, and everything is going great. NB is a super chill and laid back manager, and the work I’m doing is very interesting. Don’t think much about PD or the requirements until the end of the month, when a time sheet is due. \n\nI fill out the time sheet which is an excel file, and get my boss to print and sign it. He prints it out front and back because the sheet is all charted out for weeks at a time, and this way it is easier to read. We both sign it; I scan it in and send it off to her on the 31st as requested. Mind you I haven’t turned in anything late at this point, she has no reason to be fussy.\n\n5 days later I get an email from PD saying my sheet is not valid because it has to be all on one page. Well, I had turned in two scans because Front and Back. She states that the time records on the front are not valid, because the signature is not on that side. She’s essentially suggesting that I could be faking half my hours and lying to her. Not to mention, the one sheet requirement is nowhere to be found on the class webpage. I’m ordered to resubmit the time sheet all on one page, which means I have to get NB to sign again. Time for some delicious malicious compliance against PD.\n\nOf course at this point I have some what of a rapport with NB and he’s one of the best bosses I’ve ever had. I go to him and explain the situation, both of us understanding how ridiculous she’s being so he doubles down with me for the malicious compliance.\n\nHe proceeds to print off the excel sheet in the smallest possible font, either 4or 6pt with the cells shrunk to the smallest size. I scanned it super high quality so she can read it, but now she’ll have to zoom in and scroll across slowly in her pdf reader to see each individual time punch. \n\nWe both sign it, and I send it back to her. \n\nOn top of this, there is an on-site visit that “must be” scheduled by the the 16th. NB tells PD that he’s not available til the 20th so she’ll have to wait until then. None of the delays are my fault so I can’t get in trouble or lose the class credit. \n\n\nThis all happened in the past two days so I will follow up with more details if anyone is interested. Not the most interesting MC but it is so satisfying to go against someone like that. Have not posted here before but lurked for awhile hoping for this chance.\n\n\ntl;dr: \nmy class credit for an internship is being managed by a power trip, and she makes ridiculous request for paperwork formatting. boss joins in on malicious compliance.\n\n\nEDIT: Nothing has really happened. She has given me credit on blackboard and agreed to what my boss said without replying to my email.. I expect no more future updates. Sorry to disappoint, but the MC was minor to begin with! More like a cool story..",

        "text": "So I never really thought about this as malicious compliance, I've always remembered it as just a stressful situation, but I guess it fits.\n\nSo I have issues with anxiety, which I manage mainly through a bunch of daily little workarounds. At the time one of those workarounds was filling my messenger bag with everything I might possibly need when I left my dorm room, so I would be prepared if something happened (largely thanks to this incident, I do this a lot less now). Well, one day I went with some members of an art club I was a part of to a nearby city's museum to go see a Monet exhibit they had opened recently.\n\nWe drive up to the exhibit, get our tickets, everything seems fine; I'm excited to go see this exhibit with these people I'm trying to be friends with. However, the guard at the entrance to the museum stops me because he thinks my messenger bag *might* be too big. So I hop over to bag check which has a convenient 'this is how big bags can be' apparatus. I put my bag in and it fits exactly. I'm elated; I can keep my bag with me! The day is saved!\n\nNope. The bag check man says it's too big and needs to be checked. I point to where my bag is fitting in their approved bag dimensions. He repeats himself. I repeat myself. I'm getting agitated at this point because I didn't have the words to say that keeping my bag with me was very important, and even the thought of parting with it had me near tears. Looking back, the man was just doing his job, and maybe if I'd managed to explain why I wanted to keep it with me, he would have let it go. But at the time, nope, I could go in the museum without the bag or I couldn't go in at all.\n\nSo I checked my bag and sat on a bench off to the side and cried for a while, probably horrifying the people with me who didn't understand why it was A Big Deal to me. And after I cried I was embarrassed myself, but I was also angry. If my bag had been clearly oversized I would have been sad but I would have understood. Why have that apparatus there, getting my hopes up, if they were going to ignore it and make their own decisions anyway? I vowed to get the pettiest of petty revenge.\n\nI left the majority of my items in the bag since I didn't have any pockets, including my water bottle. The museum for god knows what reason didn't have water fountains, so every time I needed a drink (which that day was frequently), I would go up to them, hand them my token, make them search for my bag, take it five feet away to get my water bottle out and drink it in front of them, then hand it back and make them put it away again. Sometimes I remembered an item I forgot to get out and got right back in line after I'd just handed it back. All with a stony expression on my face. By the tenth time or so they were visibly uncomfortable, but hey, I wasn't allowed to take my bag with me, so what else was I supposed to do?",

        "text": "The [Lighthouse joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_and_naval_vessel_urban_legend) is a fairly old joke, with versions dating back to the 40s. A ship's captain attempts to convince another ship to divert course to avoid a collision, or admonish a ship dangerously close to collision, unaware that the \"ship\" in question is actually a lighthouse and thus couldn't follow through.\n\nNow, a few years back, I worked in the healthcare industry, with one of my responsibilities being the management of file transfers. As part of the software we used, we had a DMZ server for clients to connect to. Rather than negotiating firewalls rules and waiting for both sides to commit, this server was set up outside the firewall with security handled by the software in question. In theory, this led to incredibly quick turnaround times, as I could have a new client directory set up within minutes while on a call.\n\nIn theory.\n\nIn practice, a little more than a third of clients couldn't connect. Since it was outside our network, it wasn't being blocked by our firewall, thus the problem revolved around the client's overzealous security, typically involving a whitelist that, naturally, we wouldn't be on. Of the aforementioned third, about half of them took our advice to contact their IT department. 49% would fight it, but would back down on our very simple test suite: Try to log on outside the work network. Use your phone, wait until that night at home, whatever.\n\nBut let me tell you about the 1%.\n\nLet's keep a tie to the lighthouse joke and call this client Enterprise. The point of contact for Enterprise was... quite the character, to be polite. This should be evident as he's being introduced as the 1% of clients who couldn't connect, but refused to test it. In his own words, he didn't have time for this horseshit. Any time I suggested the possibility that the error was on his end, he didn't flip out so much as do an acrobatic pirouette off the handle.\n\nThere was no backup coming here. The work culture was very much \"break yourself to please the customer.\" Standards ignored because the client didn't care, files not processed because the client changed files and didn't notify anyone, working overtime to fix it and not charging the client because reasons, I suppose. Naturally, the backup comprised of \"I don't care, just do whatever you can to fix it.\"\n\nThis despondency lasted for about ten seconds until I pieced together the blank check I was unintentionally given. *Do whatever I can to fix it*. This was the fundamental problem: There *was* nothing I could do, because I was the proverbial lighthouse being ordered to move.\n\nSo I was going to do everything in my power to help this person.\n\n**Five weeks later**, we're still at this. Enterprise is loathing dealing with me, and no one else thinks it's worth it to learn the system, so it's not like they can bypass me. I look forward to these meetings as a way to dick around on my phone while assuring there's several more things I can try to fix the connection. Whenever management asks why it's not working, I tell them, in a somber voice that belied my great entertainment, that I was trying everything I could to get the connection to work. Finally, his higher-ups noticed that things were taking abnormally long and had their IT call me directly.\n\nIt should be telling that the opening dialogue was, \"I'm assuming the problem's on our end and he wouldn't have it.\"\n\nThree minutes later, they could access their directory, and I could still firmly say I did everything in my (non-existent) power to help.",

As most thing out of the public sectors there are lots of rules and regulations that can become a huge pain in the lower\\-back area, specially when every single project that comes across your desk is already 3 weeks late and people are blaming you and your stupid regulations.\n\nThis sadly is NOT my story, I was only a witness to the MC that took place between some colleagues.\n\nA first colleague who we'll call Max, was in charge of tenders for foods and kitchen stuff. Since the number of active projects at once can become hectic and project updates tended to get lost in your multiple systems, he had a very simple system of a huge white board in his office with projects, status and due dates for bids. Not very technological but it was simple, efficient and the team refered to it often.\n\nSadly Max left for greener pastures and Bob took over his projects. Now Bob is a hard working employee but has the nasty habbit of looking down on junior people and thinks his seniority always means he's right. The junior who worked with Max, lets call her Nancy, immediatly had problems with Bob who treated her like his personnal secretary rather than his equal. Nancy nontheless did her best to get Bob up to speed on Max's projects and white board system. Whenever Bob had a question Nancy would remind him to check the whiteboard since it usually had all the up\\-to\\-date info.\n\nThe next day Bob asked where the bids for super cool project Ninja Report were kept (sealed bids enveloppes to be opened on the due date of the tender) so Nancy told him and reminded him to not forget to check the whiteboard for the up\\-to\\-date project due date because they can change often and the updates tended to get lost in the system. Bob flipped his shit \"DON'T TELL ME HOW TO DO MY DAMN JOB!\" He took the enveloppes and left to open them with a witness (as per protocol)\n\nWouldn't you know it, the due date HAD in fact been change to 2 days later and by opening the bid enveloppes early, Bob had rendered them all invalid but also invalidated any later bids because it could not be prooved without a shadow of a doubt that other bidders did not have access to the information contained in the opened bids (like I said, a shitload of rules and regulations). Bob had to cancel the whole thing, wich was already 3 weeks late and the clients were seriously pissed.\n\nLater Bob bitched to another colleague that Nancy should have told him about the date change only to be told \"well Bob, you DID tel her not to tell you how to do your damn job...the entire floor can vouch for that\"",

So keen in fact, that there were days she would call every single staff in and preach to them about smiling. \n\nOne of my colleagues who worked in customer service took everything quite literally. And the continued insistence on smiling made him conscious about it, and when he did smile, it looked rather weird. One day, he was looking for a document requested by a customer, and realised it was not yet ready. What he did not know was that the customer had requested it a couple of times, and as per our service charter, it should have been ready for him to collect. He informed the customer that the document was not ready. With a big, wide, weird smile. And the customer blew up! Not about the document not being ready, but that my colleague 'somehow thinks it is funny.' \n\nAfter this incident, the manager stopped prodding everyone about smiling from that moment on. ",

I know my way around the English language - including punctuation.\n\nSince I have been teaching for less than two years, I have a mentor teacher, who happens to be a very straight-forward, hard-nosed type of person. Since I am in New Zealand, I'm currently in the middle of writing mid-year reports. Not the easiest time in the world, but I'm getting on with it. \n\nAs I go, my mentor and another from the senior management team are checking them over - making sure I'm following guidelines, making sure I'm making sense for the parents, etc.\n\nOne is a behavioural specialist. The other is a maths specialist. They've both been published in educational journals and I respect them both greatly - but I know more about the English language than they do. So when I saw some comments about checking my comma use, I was a little surprised.\n\nI quickly go and check the rules, and I'm right. You use a comma before a conjunction that joins two independent clauses. That said, I know this isn't a fight worth having. So I've decided I'll go along with it. No commas before conjunctions. But I will not write incorrectly.\n\nNo conjunctions. Every sentence in these reports will be as simple as I can make it. She can't complain about there being a comma before a conjunction if there aren't any.",

        "text": "Background: Everyone in my company has the same hours, technically. We are all supposed to start and finish at the same time (lunch is whenever). This is not the actual case, however. I (front facing position) am one of the first 10 (out of ~500) people to get to work everyday (including grounds crew and other front facing positions). My boss comes in an hour after the start time or later. About 50% of people come in then. A lot of people come in an hour and a half after the start time. My grandboss usually gets in two and a half hours after the start time.\n\nMy desk opens for business one hour after the start time. When I started, I came on time everyday, but since no one else came in that early (or was there to care), I started coming in around 15 to 30 minutes after the start time. I was still one of the first people to come in, and I was coming in well before my boss. I never opened late, and I would stay late to make up for it (just like everyone else). I even put it on my time sheet, to show what I was doing.\n\nThen the verdict came down from my grandboss: I was not allowed to stay late to make up time. My hours are set, and I have to be here for them. I, of course, complied. It is just frustrating, since literally every other person in the company comes in the everyday. I get here at the \"official start time\" and I sit, alone, for at least an hour.\n\nThe best part is: I have to text my boss if I am late, because she doesn't know unless I tell her.\n\nALSO: I am disabled, and it makes coming to work on time difficult for me. I am not just an asshole who hates being on time.\n\nAnyway, onto the malicious compliance.\n\nI have actually been texting my boss that I was late. I always text her and mark it on my timesheet, and she checks or doesn't. I don't know.\n\nThe middle of May was **super** busy for us. I ended up staying 10-15 minutes late most days, and I stayed 30 minutes one day. This was not on purpose, but it more than made up for my lates from that pay period. I had been told that I couldn't use staying late to make up for being late, so I used sick time on top of staying late (I have plenty of sick time). My company had to pay for me staying late AND sick time, and I got a nice fat check over it.\n\nThey still haven't changed the policy, but she hasn't said anything bad about how often I am late. And, for the most recent pay period, I had to stay late even more often.",

        "text": "This isn't my story, but the story of a friend of mine I'm going to call Steve.\n\nHe ownes a landscaping business and has several employees. They work hard and get along really well. Steve pays them for their work done by the yard, not by the hour, in addition to buying his workers two meals a day.\n\nSteve hired a guy named Jim, who isn't a bad worker at all. Jim is just a little slow on the uptake sometimes.\n\nJim decided to start a fuss. \"I don't like that we're getting paid by the yard,\" he told Steve one day. \"I wanna be paid by the hour.\" Steve explained to Jim that, when you break it down, being paid by the yard comes out to over $10 an hour (about $22 in today's money, this was back in the 80's)--or more, depending on how many yards get done--and his hourly workers only make minimum wage. Steve further explained that the paid-by-the-yard workers get perks like meals, and operate on a true merit-pay because the more they get done, the more they get paid.\n\nJim was adamant, though, so Steve agreed. \n\n**Day 1**\n\nJim showed up, ready and raring to go. He decided, it appeared, to prove to Steve that being hourly doesn't mean he'll slack off! Like I said, Jim is a good guy and not a bad worker; he has a good work ethic and a big sense of pride. A couple yards got done, and it's lunchtime. Steve grabs everyone's order and asks Jim if he is going to buy anything.\n\nJim looked confused. \"What do you mean?\"\n\nSteve re-explained. \"If you're going hourly, I can't cover your meals anymore. You'll have to buy your own lunch.\"\n\nJim grumbled but ordered something small, and after lunch they all got back to work.\n\n**Day 2**\n\nThe crew was down two guys. Jim was in a good mood, maybe out of schadenfreude, because less guys on the crew meant less yards done--but Jim was going to make the same amount either way!\n\nWith a little bit of a smug attitude, Jim got ready for work, but when he looked at the job list for the day he looked taken aback. Steve had rearranged the yards for the week so that, for this particular day, they would be working on their smallest-yard clients. That way, the workers would get paid around the same amount they normally would if they had a full crew. \n\nJim hadn't noticed that Steve did this anytime he had a smaller crew: both because it guaranteed his guys were making over the legally-required minimum for per-part work, and because it kept their pay consistent.\n\n**Day 3**\n\nThey got a lot of yards done this day. In fact, they worked really well together that day, and really dug their heels in to get the last few yards on the schedule done. They'd taken about two hours less than expected, so everybody was able to head home early. \n\nJim asked if he could maybe go take on another yard or two himself, since if everyone got off early, he wouldn't be paid any more. Steve understood, and sent Jim out to get some hedges done, which took a couple hours because he was doing it by himself. But that was okay, because that was a couple extra hours of pay, and Steve was nothing if not fair.\n\n**Day 4**\n\nJim showed up to work a little late, because the extra three hours of hedge-trimming had left him more exhausted than expected. Steve was placing an order for breakfast as he showed up, and he just stood there for a few minutes as he watched Steve writing down orders for bacon and eggs and pancakes. Finally Steve stopped at Jim. Steve didn't say anything about Jim's tardiness; it was clear Jim had worked hard the previous night.\n\n\"You buying anything, Jim?\"\n\nJim swallowed hard. \"No, sir.\"\n\n\"It'll be mighty hard to work on an empty stomach, Jim.\"\n\nJim nodded. \"Yes sir, I know. I...\" I mentioned how much pride Jim had, and he really couldn't buck up enough to admit he had miscalculated. He knew he was wrong, but he was prepared to suffer.\n\nSteve, however, was a good dude. He recognized where Jim had erred, and didn't lord it over him. He made it plain and simple: \"I'll just put you down for some eggs and bacon, then.\" And with an understanding and appreciative look, Jim started packing the truck for the morning.\n\n~\n\nThey never really discussed moving back to per-yard rate, but Steve was nothing if not fair. Jim got his next paycheck to find that he had been paid per-yard as if they hadn't changed his rate at all. This meant not only did he end up with the better rate, but he even got some extra in his paycheck for the three yards worth of hedges he had done by himself. \n\nJim stuck around a long time, and ended up managing the crew after a while. He tells people that if you treat your employees right, they'll stick around. And that's worth more than a handful of pinched pennies.\n\n~~\n\nEdit: this was the mid-80's. $10/hr then was about $22/hr today.",

        "text": "This is my first malicious compliance story, sorry if it doesn’t fit here. I apologize in advance for formatting and spelling because I’m doing this on my phone. \n\nAnyway, this happened in Boy Scouts on a camping trip. Everyone was technically supposed to figure out who’d they’d be in a tent with prior to the event, but everyone had forgotten about the rule. When we were figuring out who would be in what tent, my friends kicked me out to go to another tent. Annoying, but fine with me. \n\nI was figuring out who I would be with when one of the kids in my troop showed up. Let’s call him MM, for micromanager. MM had a clipboard and was figuring out who was in what tent. I said who I would be tenting with, and he just said, “No.”  He needed a place to sleep, so I told him that one of the tents had another spot. He looked at his clipboard and replied that that tent had seven people in it. I had to laugh, because the tents were small and could only fit 3 or 4 people at max. But I went over to them and asked them how many people were in their tent. Three, like I already knew. I told MM as so, and he EXPLODED at me, shouting about how his clipboard said there were seven people in that tent, even though that was obviously wrong. He decided that I had to set up a tent to be with him, even though there were spots for both of us in other tents. \n\nHe was trying to figure out who was in what tent by asking people who wouldn’t respond instead of just looking inside the tent, so I had to set up the tent by myself. After, a Scoutmaster (one of the adults who were in control) asked when we set up a tent. Turns out MM didn’t remember to record our tent, so we had to take it down and move in with someone else. I just moved all of my stuff into another tent that had a few of my friends, and when he told me to help him, I told him that I had to set up the tent myself while he was off somewhere. It turned out that he had been playing a game with our friends when I had to work, so he actually accepted. \n\nAnyway, sorry if this is long and rambling, I’m not quite sure if it belongs here, but thanks for reading.",
