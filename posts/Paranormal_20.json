        "text": "Non-Believer but had stuff happen I couldnt explain\n\nSo I'll say I'm a non-believer in all things spiritual, demons, ghost, god, etc etc. I'm 24 now the events I'm going to describe were when I was around my teenage years like 15-18 when still living with my parents.  \n\n\nSo the first thing was I'm not sure if this paranormal related or not. But I woke up with scratches alot, not like little scrapes or anything from just everyday activity, but like deep long scratches that looked almost like claw marks, usually in sets of 3 or 4. They were all over my body in random places. When I asked my parents about them they just said \"oh your probably scratching yourself in your sleep or something don't worry about it. But I kept my nails trimmed and couldn't replicate them while awake.   \nThey continued appearing until I moved out of the upstairs bedroom into the now finished basement.   \n\n\nThe second event also in the same bedroom, was I was 16 I think?  I was having trouble sleeping one night, I regularly and still do have some minor sleeping problems, but most nights I slept with my door closed for whatever reason I left it open that night, must have just forgot to close it or something. Anyway I'm tossing and turning I look at my phone its like 3:45am, I'm like Shit i gotta be up for school soon. So I roll over in bed about to go to the bathroom, and I look at my door and there was a white figure, almost looked a man with no face, wearing some kind overcoat, leaning in my door just staring at me. It scared the hell out of me. I rolled back over and kept my head under the covers, checking every so often it was still there just staring at me. Eventually I just passed out and my alarm woke me up for school and it was gone in the morning.   \n\n\nAnyway those were my experiences sorry for the long post, just figured I'd share get some thoughts and opinions. I chalk up the second encounter to lack of sleep, but the scratches I still cant explain.   \n\n\nThanks for hearing me out!",

        "text": " \n\nWhen I was 6, we moved into an old house, and I used to hear all kinds of noises at night, like banging on the walls, or footsteps coming up the stairs. But as I got older the footsteps got closer until one day while I was in bed, I heard the door open and close, then someone walked over to my bed and sat down right-on top of my legs, I thought it might have been my dad or mom, but I wasn‚Äôt going to find out. I carefully tried to pull them out without them knowing but I couldn‚Äôt they were too heavy, so I just lay there terrified until I eventually fell asleep. \n\nI asked my parents the next day who was sitting on my bed, but everyone denied it. The next night it happened again, and the night after and so on. I was always too scared to look, until one night my dad was supposed to bring me home a gift but went out for a drink on the way home and was late, so I had to go to bed. But I couldn‚Äôt sleep every noise I heard I thought it was him, then I heard footsteps up the stairs, then the door opens, and he walks over sits down on my legs. This time I was sure it was my dad so I threw the blanket off and jumped up, but there was no one there and when I looked down at my legs there was an ass sized shape on my legs. Without thinking I tried to pull them out, suddenly the ass sized dent started moving as if some unseen person was trying to get more comfortable. \n\nAs I got older the closer he got to me until one night he lay down beside me and put his hand around me. I was freaked out, but too scared to move so I just lay there too scared to even breathe, I would have believed it was a real person if I had not locked the door with a key like I did every other night.¬† \n\nMy parents never believed me, not even after I woke up with deep cuts on my back, but they did take me to a doctor. Which did not go well for them because they got accused of hurting me even though I swore that it wasn‚Äôt them and that I just woke up like that. I still have the scars today but now I lie and say that I just fell, which people still don‚Äôt believe because they look like whip marks. What happened next is a very long story. \n\nBut now I am 40 and have kids of my own, my youngest is 12 and something is following her ever since she was a baby when we heard it talking to her on the baby monitor. \n\nThe whole family seen it multiple times, it‚Äôs the shape of a little girl, but I don‚Äôt think it is. We often see it hiding in her room or running past the kitchen door, we tried moving 3 times, but it keeps following her. I am afraid the same thing that happened to me will happen to her and it will be all my fault.",

My aunt had a small house and not much space so she turned a walk-in closet into a little bedroom with a bed for her daughter (my cousin). My cousin was probably 4 or 5 at the time. She was napping with her back to them. My dad and aunt were using the Ouiga board and not getting much results. The hand would move around erratically and pretty much speak jibberish to them. My dad started getting frustrated and yelled ‚Äúwell fuck, just say something already!!‚Äù At that moment, my little cousin‚Äôs body flipped over (like a flapjack, no other movements to steady herself) toward them and yelled ‚ÄúNO!

        "text": "About five years ago I (then 26F) was asleep in bed with my then boyfriend. It was summer and hot as ever so I was sleeping naked with no blankets. At about 1am I woke up to the distinct feeling of someone smacking my butt. Hard. Not only did the feeling of it wake me up but the loud smack sound did too. I was absolutely distraught. I‚Äôve had many paranormal experiences but nothing ever physical and was completely caught off guard and terrified. My boyfriend searched around the room for some logical explanation while I sobbed and tried to explain what happened but he couldn‚Äôt find anything to explain it. He had also been woken up by the loud smack. \n\nOnce I calmed down enough we went back to sleep with the lights on. Shortly after falling asleep I woke up lying on my side in a full sleep paralysis episode. I couldn‚Äôt move or speak and could hear a man‚Äôs voice (not my boyfriend‚Äôs) laughing behind me. This went on for a bit as I tried to scream or move and finally was able to roll over and saw nothing. I didn‚Äôt go back to sleep that night. \n\nThe next day I called my grandmother who is a medium and asked her if she could sense anything in my home. I told her nothing about my experience from the night before. She told me there was a man in my house who would sit in the living room and wait for me to come home. She said he was mostly harmless but enjoyed seeing me scared and would get a good laugh out of frightening me. A couple days later I worked up the courage to yell into my ‚Äúempty‚Äù house that he wasn‚Äôt welcome and had to leave and wasn‚Äôt all of to scare me anymore. I had no more experiences with him after that.",

        "text": "Dream: January 12, 2023\n\n(Among the scariest and metaphorically deepest dreams I had)\n\n(Honestly, I am writing this an hour and a half after because I need something to keep my mind busy. I don't want to go back to sleep)\n\nIntro:\n\nThe dream was much longer but I'll describe a series of events towards the end of my dream that I remember quite clearly and where it became meaningful. The majority of what I wrote was directly after my dream, a rare instance when I remember far more of my dream than I usually do. Grammar and writing are also somewhat bad. But I wrote things fast and described more the feelings I had during my time in the dream.\n\nSome more context: I live in a house with 10 other people. Each shares a room except me I have my own. Don't have strange vibes in the room outside of this one incident. Although I recall dreaming of the same building in a different dream as a tenant. Also was an odd dream, but not scary in any capacity just a weird feeling as I had with this dream until it got scary. Dreaming of the building was also in this room not sure exact date.\n\nSide Story:  \n\\-Was told by one of my roommates. Two people living there in my room before both had sleep paralysis at the time in my room. Both people had sleep paralysis in sequence at the same time. She also keeps saying there is 'something' in my room.  \n(Didn‚Äôt believe her thought she was messing with me when she mentioned the first time) (mentioned it again after 3-4 months, thinking what she said could be probable)¬†  \n\\-Now I had it. The first time I remember having it and needing to scream.  \n\\-Although I screamed (deep scream: I am male) because I thought I was still in the dream. I think people in the rooms next to me heard me.\n\nStart:\n\n\\-I visited the outside of one big building which could have been hospital (played as hotel/apartment in my previous dreams), was in older dreams a decrepit place as a hotel/apartment I stayed in.¬†\n\n\"This time it was not.\" -(I wrote this when I was writing this after the dream) ( may have been a feeling? hinting towards a metaphorical hospital) (As in the dream it did not appear as a hospital.) (Had the vibe of coming back after a long period of time in the dream)\n\n\\-Remember talking to the employee (black clothes/hat like Vall√©) out front.\n\nAsked: (Do the elevators work? (Do people live here))\n\nResponds: (With enthusiasm/friendliness) Yes.\n\n\\-The building had red bricks made up of it originally. The outside where I have had an alleyway structure as they have for Vall√©s in movies. However, I only recently saw a structure similar to this last with a similar layout at the hospital where I dropped my grandfather off whom died only a couple hours later last summer.\n\n\\-When walking away from it and looking back, saw a more complete view of the building. It however, morphed from a red brick building layout to a modern building with billboards etc. Remembering 2-3 towers¬†separated in the¬†building's overall layout.\n\n\\-Next to the hospital there was a side shelter from which you had to go downstairs for pub/drinks. I walked there after talking to the employee of the hotel.  \n\\-Bartender, says alcohol is cheap because of how direct it is made. \"I am fortunate that I am not affected (turned off) by it's look.‚Äù (Bartender was very close to me as bar was very small, and remember drinking offbrand beer)  \n\\-Some time passes- remember sitting down at the staircase of 'bar' and talking to the bartender sitting next to me.  \n\\-I remember describing to the bartender \"How my soul is stuck in the building and my physical body is not.\" (Not sure why I said this: Upon waking up I think it was a metaphor)  \n\\-Bartender asks ‚ÄòHow?'\n\nAfter this, I only remember the last bit before I woke up.\n\n\\-Something went wrong, I started having flashes every time I closed or opened my eyes. Every time a different frame.¬†  \nMetaphorical things. (Picture the following POV: stage set type lights/but looking straight down in an omniscient point of view)  \n\\-Rameen noodles and some water moving it like on a beach (remember this scene being red and white), further random things every time I blinked: I don‚Äôt remember but many frames I remember were ones similar to the one previous, (gradually building up, scenes were not scary but the vibe was)¬†  \n(After the build-up, I am trying made to wake up? Heart rate increases?)  \n(Last frames happened fast as I was scared and blinked fast to try to get out and wake up, however, each time I blinked a new frame was completely different from the one before.)  \n\\-one of the last frames was a white dog (creature)? seemed like it was crawling on the ceiling,¬†  \n\\-last few frames I remember picturing my head under my bed covers and there I couldn‚Äôt hide something was there (kept blinking)\n\n\\- I kept blinking each time I appeared in or out of the bed covers. However, everytime I couldn't get away... something was there.  \n\\-last frame (I screamed) the bed covers was above me and something was in the corner that was holding it up.¬†\n\nEnded up screaming in direction of my left curtain thinking that was holding my sheets up.¬†When I heard my voice I realized I woke up finally.  \nNot sure when I dreamed this:¬†  \n(Could have been what happened after with the bartender or before the building)  \n\\-remember being asked to pick up an Xbox game for Roommate A/somebody else (maybe other roommate B)  \n\\-Remembering going into pawn shops to find a Watch/Xbox?  \n\\-Remember just appearing in front of places no real physical journey was made.¬†  \n\\-Nothing was recognizable although I remember English being present. So not Europe.¬†\n\nMetaphors:\n\n\\-Building can be metaphorical to a hospital? This is due to the alleyway structure/red bricks in front of it that I saw last summer.¬†\n\n\\-Rameen noodles are metaphorical because I ate it day of and is a common food I eat in the house.\n\nHouse itself: I may have seen a black dot in my peripheral vision before. When looked nothing was there. Happened 1-2 times since here.\n\nOverall: I am not one who believes in ghosts. But after this dream/sleep paralysis. I decided to write the contents of the dream. There could be something in this room.\n\nIf anything happens again. I'll update this account. If no update: I either died (ironic) or nothing happened again (plausible).",

        "text": "This is a story told by my grandmother. The kind of story related with her eyes wide open. I trust her, she's sincere, so I'm ruling out the possibility of a made-up story. I've been asking her about it over the years because it's so strange and curious for me to imagine such encounter.\n\nPlease note that I'm a rational person, critical-thinker, who usually seeks explanation of phenomena in a pure scientific manner. I'm not looking for the sensational and I hate made-up stories because I feel that my intelligence is offended. But I'm also aware that there is more to Nature than science and I approach the unknown with an open mind.\n\nWhen she was a kid, 70 years ago, she was walking home through her village's forest, at night. The road and forest weren't unknown to her, as she often took that road at day or night. There was nothing special about that forest or village, nor any special past-time stories about them.\n\nBut in this particular night, suddenly she saw a tall, thin, white, ghost-looking entity walking between the trees. She couldn't say if she was noticed, because she got so afraid, that she ran until home, hurting her feet.\n\nThat's it. How do you interpret this story? Have you heard of similar stories? Is there a history of these kind of sightings? Can it be categorised somehow? Are there any trust-worthy sources where I could read more about this phenomena? I recall watching a documentary about a strange forest in some nordic country, where all the people knew about strange appearances, \"forest spirits\", even the Prime Minister was interviewed about it. Do you happen to know the name of this film?\n\nThank you",

        "text": "First i want to share that myself and my family have always believed some kind of supernatural something. I am 100% open to the possibility that all monsters we hear about are true. There has been far too many unexplained things in my life personally, as well as life in general for people to think otherwise. \n\nI know a little bit about a little bit but have two stories that I‚Äôd like someone who knows a little more to share what they think. \n\n(Please ignore my grammar and spelling. I get it, I‚Äôm dumb)\n\n-When i was a kid, between 10 and 12, my brother and i had a friend over. It was around 7pm and my mom was at choir practice. We were the only people in the home. We were playing in the living room when we saw my mom outside waving her keys that had a very specific Harley Davidson leather strap on it, through the window playfully like ‚Äúyooohooo!‚Äù We were confused because she left for practice a while ago and usually didn‚Äôt come home for another hour or so. We waited for her to come inside. When she didn‚Äôt we were scared so we went to my brothers room and stayed there until my mom was home. We told her about it and she swore it wasn‚Äôt her and said we were smart to not go outside looking for her. \nI‚Äôve read things about skinwalkers and a couple other theories. But ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n-the next story is harder to explain and i wish i could draw lol. A couple years ago my ex picked me up from work around 11pm. We weren‚Äôt even smoking, just taking the long way home and chatting. We were coming up to an intersection with a car coming to their stop sign in the opposite direction. Their car stopped short as this thing ran across the road. It was blueish but transparent, taller than the car, had very weirdly bent back legs the way a ware-wolf would be drawn i guess, and very long arms but running on all 4. The way it was shaped looked like it wasn‚Äôt always on all 4 like a dog. Maybe the best way to try to describe it would be when you see those videos of people running around like a horse lol. Like butt in the air, feet flat, hands flat, head down. But it‚Äôs body was not human like, it‚Äôs body was longer and dog like. Ugh see, this is why i wish i could draw none of this makes sense lol. \nThe car filled up with tension as we both stopped talking when we saw it. We didn‚Äôt say a word until we were out of that intersection. I was like ‚Äúi think‚Äù and she interrupted ‚Äúi know‚Äù and she kept driving until we were away from that area to talk about it. We described it exactly the same as eachother. At first we figured a warewolf but I‚Äôm not sure. When i was a teenager my friend and i would ride our bikes around town all night into the morning and one day as we were heading home around 5am when we saw (i think) the same thing running along side of us very briefly before running into the woods. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts on what either could be?",

Stacy wasn't on the vacation. Stacy's response to me being sensitive was \"we know.\" \n\nwho the f is \"we\"? that would be Stacy and John. what she meant by that was that she and John had always had a feeling that i am Celia reincarnated, if not just one of the \"lucky\" ones to be sensitive. \n\nStacy said that my presence had always felt like Celia's, that things that i say and faces that i make are just like Celia and that i know things about Celia's children that i shouldn't know without having been told.\n\nfor example, as children, my cousin, sister and i would always ask my grandmother (dads mom, Celia's daughter) and her 4 siblings what they were like as kids, and i never failed to tell them exactly how they were like to the T. \n\na few things that also help put the pieces together are that when i was younger, every time i visited my grandmothers house i always wanted to hear about Celia but i could never remember her name. i wanted to know specifically how she died. every. single. visit. another thing is that i have always had a fascination and a draw to the early 1900's. i have always wanted to know about the fashion, the language, the lifestyle, but i never cared too much about anything else besides just the average citizens that would have lived back then. this fascination matters because considering my grandmother was born in 1953 and she has older siblings, i find it safe to assume Celia was born late 1910's / early 1920's.\n\never since hearing this information i haven't felt like myself. i have actually felt like my body is my own, but my soul is someone else, which i'm sure is normal with this. though i have also found an odd comfort in knowing my soul could have existed before. \n\nare me and my family thinking too much, or could this be real?",

We heard a knock at the front door and my mom asked my sister and I to see who was there. We ran to the front door, checking the side window first to see if we could see anyone but didn‚Äôt. We then open the two doors but no one was there. We had an oval mirror next to the door. Now I was too short to see myself in the mirror, but what I did see was a very tan lady, who maybe looked in her early to mid 30s with blonde hair. In the mirror, she was looking straight at me. I turn around and no one is behind us. I turn back to the mirror and she is gone. My sister and I look at each other and quickly run to our mom and tell her what we saw. She goes and checks it out and sees nothing. It was the only time I saw that lady in the house, but I experienced other events in the house as well, but this one always struck as one of the stranger ones.",

        "text": "So, I've always heard anecdotes on Reddit, TikTok, and other forums that say, \"Never tell anyone in your dream that you know you're dreaming.\"\n\n\nI never believed them, until today.\n\n\nNot too long ago, I was asleep and I was having a dream about work. I was aware that I was asleep because now and again I would have a dream where I would float in the air as if gravity doesn't affect me. The only thing stopping me from flying into space is that I'm usually in a building, so the ceiling always stops me.\n\n\nThis building happened to be the store I work at.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of chatting with my coworkers, I got bored with the whole floating-in-the-air thing, so I asked one of them for help. Only then did they notice me, laughed it off, and asked me, \"is this a common occurrence?\" To which I replied, \"Only when I'm dreaming,\" and they laughed again. \n\n\nThey stopped helping me down and instead let me go, to which my body started to float inside the store. The customers inside were no longer shopping, but rather standing at both entrances with the sliding doors, their silhouette grayed out, but it was clear they were staring directly at me. As I floated past them, inside the store, which now had all the lights turned off; the entrance was only dimly lit by the sunlight outside. Meanwhile, everyone stood still - continuing to look at me without saying a word. \n\n\nAll except this one girl. \n\n\nShe was walking next to me as I floated by her, her head down towards her cart. She wasn't walking fast, but she also wasn't moving slowly - just keeping pace with me. Yet, she refused to show me her face, though her hair made me think of someone I hadn't seen in years since I graduated high school.\n\n\nEventually, I felt myself getting heavy and I knew I was about to wake up. Every time I try to control my dreams and spawn something in, my body gets heavy and it automatically wakes me up. \n\n\nExcept for this time, I wasn't alone. On my bed, was the same girl that refused to look at me. She was just sitting on my bed, looking away. I tried to reach out and touch her, but my arm was moving slowly as if time had slowed down. She turned around and smiled at me with this creepy look, and then quickly turned back around. That happened three times until I felt like I was about to touch her, then my entire body reset - my arms now back to my side and she was this time laying on her stomach, her head in her arms as she cried. Before I could do anything to move again, I blinked and she was gone. My body had jolted itself awake, and it was over.\n\n\nI won't lie, it wasn't scary since I was aware she was a hallucination of my sleep paralysis, but now I kind of want to do it again. I'm curious if she would appear again or if it would be someone new. The sun has just gone up and my room is dimly lit, just like how it was in my dream, which means that my brain was using that as a reference. I do remember vaguely in those forums that people say you shouldn't mess with these things, so would it be a good idea to try again?\n\nAnyways, I just had to tell someone about this experience.

He was in hospital for around 9 days and 1 day in hospice where he died. When he was in the hospital, before he massively declined and stopped talking, he was quite confused because of the tumours in his brain. He didn‚Äôt know he was there because he was about to die, he thought he was there for treatment. One day I was alone with him when he went into a series of seizures. I stayed with him while the doctors worked on him. I talked to him and between seizures he seemed to recognise my voice. Afterwards, when he was awake again he was saying how proud of me he was for working with the doctors on his treatment. He was telling my mum he was so proud of me.\n\nAt the time, I was dealing with a bad ED relapse because it was the only way I could cope with what was happening, including bulimia which he never knew about. My dad was always proud of me but I felt sad and ashamed that he wouldn‚Äôt be if he knew how I was actually doing. Fast forward to after his death, around 1-2 weeks later I had a very vivid visitation dream. He was standing in my room. I could see the details of my bedroom exactly how they were, I might as well have been awake with how vivid the dream was.\n\nMy dad was healthy looking again and had a calm, peaceful energy to him. He told me he was okay, he knew we had been by his side when he died and he heard everything we said. He said ‚ÄúI know you are scared I wouldn‚Äôt be proud of you but I still am. You were amazing and I will always be proud of you. I‚Äôm just sorry you are going through this and want you to be happy‚Äù. \n\nI told him again that I love him and I hope he‚Äôs okay, he reassured me he was. Then I woke up, already crying but with this amazing feeling of peace‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard to describe. Some people would say this is just a dream, but I know this was my dad‚Äôs spirit visiting me. The vividness, the feeling when I woke up, the sense of peace that was there. Him visiting me really did help let go of the shame and I felt reassured he was okay. \n\nSorry this was so long!

It just can‚Äôt be a coincidence. \n\nI always had it in the back of my mind that maybe someone had been wishing bad upon me all along, maybe they‚Äôve done something to send evil my way. Then I started looking into my old friend groups/acquaintances from the past that I‚Äôve ran into here and there throughout the years. Maybe there are a few people I could think of who would do such a thing out of spite and jealousy. Is this really possible? Has anyone else experienced anything like this before? Pretty spooked after reflecting the last couple of hours.",

So a dark figure, in the doorway. I don't know if it was sleep paralysis because, due to my young age at the time, the memory is fuzzy and I'm not sure if I had the ability to move or not. I have never had sleep paralysis since then, and I'm just curious. Paranormal or sleep paralysis???",

        "text": "Hello! I have had experiences with the entity known as \"Hat Man\" several times, which I won't get into here but might be useful info for some of you. I'm kind of hoping Michael Shermer or someone super smart will read this and explain it in a way that doesn't kill my last sliver of hope. Question related to the post title starts in paragraph three.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuick background: during my teen years my homelife was very unstable due to mentally disturbed parents, and before then, when I was a child, my parents had been great. It was like they flipped a switch and became extremely psychologically abusive and manipulative over night (my therapist spent years trying to understand this, as my parents' behaviour didn't follow any personality pattern known to science, but neither of us ever figured it out, and she *knew* they were disturbed because they kept calling her practice to talk about weird stuff to the lady at the front desk even though they weren't patients there).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my 20s, I woke up one night and saw Hat Man in my apartment while having a night terror. That's the first and only time I've seen him, and while it terrified me, I didn't think anything of it the next morning. Two years later I saw that people on the internet had seen a pitch black man wearing a trench coat and wide-brimmed hat during SP, and when I saw their drawings of him I almost fainted with fear because he looked exactly like I had seen him. Then, even worse, when I told my therapist about it she went pale and asked me what I thought HM might be, and I realized that she'd seen him herself. Before that session she'd been an unapologetic atheist, but after that she became less and less dismissive of religious teachings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway. About six months ago, I had a dream that I think was meant to be a nightmare, except I wasn't scared. The dream took place in my parents' home in broad daylight, and in their living room was a deathly pale man standing in my way so that I had to push past him whenever I wanted to go through the living room. He was about 5'7, kinda prehistoric looking with a rodent-like face or like his teeth made a box shape at the lower front of his face with his mouth closed and his cheeks were hollow. His hair was yellowish blonde with grey streaks in it and slicked back, and his hairline began far back on his head. He had no other hair anywhere on his body (which was VERY white). A clean, white cloth worn as underwear was the only piece of clothing he had, and so he was near-naked. He had no eyes. Instead, the eye sockets (like, imagine the size of men's eye sockets when they're not covered in flesh and skin, just the skull, except the size of this guy's eye sockets was visible in spite of being covered in skin) looked like they'd been covered in eye shadow: lightly applied at the periferis of the sockets, and then gradually darker towards the center. Except the sockets looked bottomless, as if it wasn't eye shadow that made them dark like that, but as if his eye sockets were tunnels that went into his head and continued straight in for miles even though his head looked normal on the outside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if he could see with his eye sockets or not. All I know is that he kept blocking my way to scare me everytime I needed to pass, but I never got scared for whatever reason. When I walked past him, kinda shoving him aside with my shouder, he would slightly resist with his own shoulder and turn his face towards me. Then, when I was in the next room looking back at him, he produced a white mask (kinda like the ones you did at school where your friend covered your face with plaster and left holes for the eyes and nostrils, except this guy's mask looked plastic and had little to no features), and he held the mask in front of his face so that I could see the darkest parts of his sockets but nothing else. While looking at him, I thought to myself that he was covering his face to scare me because getting in my way hadn't been enough, but I just didn't feel anything, and I also thought that he was kind of an idiot because the mask honestly didn't make much of a difference to his appearance, and then I walked past him one more time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I read reddit posts yesterday about the creepy last words of dying people. One user said that they'd heard a dying person say \"they have no eyes! they have no eyes!\" in absolute terror. Then, of course, another user reported having heard a dying person describe a pitch black man with red eyes (Hat Man, presumably).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason I'm reaching out for advice on here is because I'm at my wit's end. What exactly does a person have to do to not get stuck with these assholes when you die? I mean, I've heard that serial killers who've had NDEs have reported seeing pleasant things, and I bet all those pedophilic catholic priests have wonderful death moments (you never hear otherwise). Meanwhile, I've never murdered, raped, or otherwise harmed anyone, and I still can't seem to get away from the worst that hell has to offer. WHAT AM I DOING WRONG!!!??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts you have on this subject - PLEASE share them!!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was raised a very moderate and liberal protestant and wasn't taught about hell at all, but I'm pretty sure there are better candidates for that destination than myself.\n\nAlso: like I said, the abuse was only ever psychological (and not to gross you out, but the hymen that covered my vaginal opening when I moved away from home kinda confirms that I was never raped). And yet, I woke up one night to my body being positioned on its back with my arms over my head on the pillow and my thighs being forcefully pushed apart. As I was seeing a therapist at the time, I told her about it and we went over the whole \"suppressed memory\" things for months, but I have absolutely no sex trauma, no PTSD and no issues with hearing about rape or the like (other than the empathy all people have for rape victims, of course).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I destined to be with the eyeless and the pitch black assholes of the universe forever and ever when I'm dead? What for? Is it because I'm depressed? How the fuck is that my fault!?",

Other than a few things here and there I wouldn't call it haunted. My mother's lamp is going crazy. It's one you touch to turn on. Further touching changes the colour. It was flashing every colour at once. I turn it off, and soon it does it again, only this time, it won't let me turn it off until I disconnected it from the electricity. \n\nToday, my mum made burgers. I'd finished my meal and went upstairs. The stairs require a U turn to reach the top, and in the middle is a landing with a window to the garden and neighbours house. In this window is a potted plant. \n\nI see the brightest flash of light I've ever seen. I've seen lightning up close, and this was brighter. I could see the shadow of the walls and the plant. Everything else was pure white. I got a headache and felt sick a while afterwards. The neighbours definitely weren't outside, and the flash seemed to come from the garden. I can't explain how odd it was. I thought the city had been nuked or something. I swear if my eyes were closed I'd still have seen perfectly.\n\nLater, I'm calm. It had snowed and I was happy, drinking some Vermouth. Dad complains about the light at the bottom of the garden, near the woods. It's motion activated. I look, and sure enough it's constantly being activated until the battery finally dies.\n\nI feel like this is more than just coincidence. I won't explain, but recently I angered the neighbours across the street. They are satanists. There are always strange lights coming from that house and the blinds move in odd ways on their own. I'm thinking that she (the daughter, who dabbles in that stuff) has done this. I'm not too scared, as my family on my mother's side are self-proclaimed witches. Not your stereotypical reddit, teenage witches. The real, celtic kind.\n\nThis story probably sucks but yeah, this is just the last 2 days. There were also noises, including banging and crying, in the garden tonight.\n\nAm I attributing random things to the supernatural here? Or have I entered a spiritual war with a neighbour?",

I was sitting with my mom crying and hugging her.\n I looked at her and she was not my mom. Her eyes did not look right it is hard to explain. The rest of her face blank. Kind of like a dead person.

Today's parts include two more stories.  \n Part V: In December of 2021, my girlfriend and our son moved into an apartment in Aberdeen, WA. In no way is she a non believer of the paranormal, but she does get spooked at the idea of sharing a roof with a spirit. In the year of living at this apartment, she hadn't heard any knocking, movement and/or seen any shadow figures. Some time after I started visiting her, we quickly found signs that we weren't alone. She would hear knocks or what sounded like something wandering around in her home.   \n\n\nAround the third or fourth time of me coming over, we hopped into the shower after a long day of adventuring. After rinsing off and stepping out to dry off I looked up into our son's room, and peering out at me was a tall shadow figure with long arms and glowing red eyes. Within a blink of an eye, it disappeared. Panicked, I leaned into the shower and told my girlfriend what happened. Shocked and stunned she responded ‚Äús\\*\\*\\* up no way, you're joking right?‚Äù After drying off and getting dressed I inspected our son's room but couldn't find any sign of the apparition. After both of us calmed down and went to bed we woke up the next morning talking about what we encountered.  \n\n\n Fast forward to a couple more weeks later, we started moving our son to his own bed and plugged in our baby monitor then climbed into our bed cuddled up in pure darkness. As we were slowly drifting to sleep, we could hear our son start to cry. We were laying there letting him cry out a bit. Then suddenly, hitting us like a truck, a deep demonic-like voice came through the monitor ‚ÄúWAKE UP!‚Äù Chills went up our spines and raced into his room and scooped him up and ran back to our bed. We finally moved her out of the apartment and closer to town.  \n Part VI: My first adventure with my girlfriend in a ghost town. As a sweet surprise my girlfriend took me out to The Franklin Ghost Town. It was an old coal mining town back in the 1880‚Äôs. In 1894, thirty-seven coal miners suffocated due to a fire that was intentionally started. It's around a 2.5 mi hike but the path splits in two. At the split, there's an old black minecart. The first path we took was straight, past the cart and into the residential area where old foundations are riddled with vine everywhere, along with beautiful scenery.   \n\n\nWe continued further down the path and thought we were walking onto private property. So we quickly turned around walking back to the split path. It felt different, almost as if we were being watched from the old foundations. When we made it back to the other path, we heard some of the conversions from the other hikers as they were passing by talking about the cemetery. Continuing on the path we made it to a big hole covered in old rail tracks and welded rebar which is the same tunnel that the miners suffocated in. I desperately wanted to visit the cemetery, so my girlfriend and I continued down this narrow path.   \n\n\nOne look on our left side and we could slide down the steep slope. We got about half way there to our destination when my girlfriend pointed out this massive mine cart track that goes through the woods (side note: nature reclaiming man made buildings is something I enjoy taking pictures of and witnessing.) After a little while of hiking, we finally made it to the cemetery. It was beautiful. Some headstones had fallen over on their own due to time in the elements, others had ivy and moss grown over and every headstone had a gift left out for them: old coins and toys for the little ones.   \n\n\nI remember reading a headstone of a little one who passed when they just turned one. This hike was gorgeous and the sights and smells were capturing and will forever be engraved in my head. It definitely gave me spooky vibes but I might have to return with a spirit box.",

Nonetheless, we headed out on our bikes.\n\nWe came across an abandoned house near a farmers field and forest. \n\nWe started to explore the premises and we decided to settle here for a while. We walked in, checked things out and were just hanging out and sharing our findings. \n\nI started to hear the sound of rocks or gravel being moved through water ( like a slurry) emanating from the basement, I thought it was my friends playing in the house. I briefly ignored this. Suddenly there was wailing and the sound of gravel was getting louder like thrashing, like someone was throwing rocks or gravel. \n\nFrozen. There was no way my friends could make that noise. Quiet fast talking surrounded us. My one friend started to cry uncontrollably, his brother ( a warrior type kid) was preparing to protect his brother.\n\nTogether, we could see inside the house's front Hall and stairwells. The new Boy was giggling and gesturing us to come downstairs by waving us in with his hand.\n\nWe stood there dumbfounded. How or what? How did he not know the immediate danger we were in, that he was in!? I wanted to get him as I thought this was possibly his last moment on earth. \n\nBut I watched him return up from the dark stairwell leading to the basement.  He was still giggling and mirroring the exact same motion, he returned again downstairs and out of sight. \n\nWe screamed at him! But he kept doing the exact same thing over and over again. He was actually speeding up, like 2x then 3x faster. \n\nThe noises from the basement, I can only describe as pure despair, like an agonizing, painful and doom like quality, but they were human, or atleast human like.\n\nWe screamed at the Boy that we were leaving and it seemed like he was coming outside.  \n\nFrantic, we just started biking as fast as possible, petrified with fear I couldn't look back.\n\nIt was Dusk now and we had no time to reconvene, we separated immediately and went home before we were grounded. \n\nI asked my friends the next day if anyone saw the other boy?\n\n They responded, they thought he was someone else's friend from our group. We didn't even know his name or where he came from and we never saw him again.",

It is also the location of Hangar No. 1. \n‚ÄúHangar No. 1 is an airship hangar located at Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst in Manchester Township, New Jersey. It was the intended destination of the rigid airship LZ 129 Hindenburg prior to the Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937, when it burned while landing.‚Äù\n\nWe lived in a Sears kit home on the circle which was down the street from Hangar No. 1.\n\nThe home had a basement with a cement floor that covered about half the area and then there was a finished room with yet another adjoining room that once had a toilet and sink (they were removed so that a dirt floor with a closed off pipe was all that was there). This particular room made me physically ill whenever I went near it.\n\nThe second floor of the house had 1 large bedroom and rooms that were were overhangs on each side, so the height of those two rooms was only about 5‚Äô-6‚Äô. We let our daughter use one side as her bedroom and the other side as a playroom. The playroom had what we called an elf door, but it was just access to a crawl space. The playroom also gave me a bad vibe. \n\nMy daughter was 3-4 at the time and she would frequently ask me at breakfast why the tooth fairy was visiting her if she didn‚Äôt have a tooth under her pillow. I was alarmed but played along and asked what does she look like? My daughter said she was always in a white dress with white hair and her feet never touched the ground. I said maybe she was just checking on you because she likes you. It was frequent and my daughter was never scared. She said sometimes the lady tucked her in. \nIn the same house I once felt someone sit on the bed while I was laying down having a minor meltdown. I also had items misplaced only to find them in the place I just looked. \nThe first floor was where I spent most of my time. I am a big fan of puzzles and every time I put one together I would always be missing the last piece. I would leave the room and loudly announce that I couldn‚Äôt finish without the last piece and when I returned.. it was there. The area is within the Pine Barrens as well. The Pine Barrens is the location of the Jersey Devil.",

He had an extra bed in his room where I had been sleeping  until waking up from the sound of his voice calling from the restroom, ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs here!‚Äù His voice was shaky. I opened my eyes and looked toward the hallway. He was peeking out of the restroom door, looking down the hall and then back at me, worried. Then he ran into the room and jumped on my bed, staring into the hallway. I tried to see what he was so afraid of. There was nothing there. But then immediately, we heard slow deliberate foot steps as if someone were walking through the hallway toward our room. Yet there was no one there to be seen. My cousin, who was normally a pretty tough kid, was holding my arm and shivering in fright. I tried to rationalize what was happening, but the foot steps were crystal clear and not subtle at all. We even heard the metal floor heater shake as the foot steps passed over it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äù walked to the threshold of the bedroom, then stopped. At that point the room felt very cold. \nNote: there were no pets in the house at that time. And the only other person there was my Aunt. She was clearly asleep as my cousin tried to wake her up first when he initially heard the steps moving through the house. Also, her bedroom door was open at the end of the hall, so we could see her as lying there as we heard the steps. My Aunt also had many paranormal experiences in the house as well, which we learned after we told her what happened.",

Then the shaking stop and I'm in some sort of paralysis. I could hear something in the kitchen. It sounds as if someone is getting closer. I try to say help, hoping my brother could hear from his room but I can't muster the breath to yell. I instead let out a whisper.\n\nThen I was able to snap out of it by somehow microshaking. Like I did everything possible to shake my body little by little until I was fully snapped out of it. This happened a few more times throughout the years but I eventually figured out how to counter it. Once I realized I could shake myself to snap out of it, I would always use that technique when I felt like it was going to happen again. I often wondered what would happen if I just surrendered and let the effect ride on. But I always shook myself awake. \n\nWhen I moved away from that apt, it never happened again. Was that a paranormal experience or just sleep paralysis? And why did it only happen in that apt?",

It used to be an apartment but when the man downstairs passed away (in the hospital, not in the house) we turned it into a single family home. Anyways, I was very close with my aunt Julia who was very old when I was born. Even though she was old she would read to me, color with me, play with me, and held me- even broke her hip holding me knowing that I was getting too big, but she loved me so much that she kept trying. I spent every day at my grandma's house with her while my parents worked, and one day while I was in bed with her holding me, she passed away. Many family members were also in the room, and when I realized that she passed I felt this sense of pure comfort and peace come over me. My grandma took me out of the bed and explained what happened, and I apparently smiled and said that I knew. I was about two and a half when this happened. After that, I kept telling my family that she sat in my room while I slept; she told me that she was there to protect me. Everybody thought that I was just processing death the best I could as a child, but I was never really upset with the fact that she died while she was holding me because even as as kid I understood that she went peacefully and there was nothing to be scared of. My family was religious so at the time I was happy that she went to heaven. Of course, my parents and grandparents sat me down and had conversations about it, and I took it well. Every morning when I woke up I would tell my parents that she was there watching me sleep and it started to freak them out, so they took me to a doctor to talk about my feelings and what I was \"imagining.\" A couple days after the appointment, I was playing in my room and saw my aunt and started talking to her while we played together. My mom walked in and asked me who I was talking to, and I pointed and said Auntie Julia. My mom looked horrified and picked me up and took me out of my room and sat me on the couch and turned on the TV so she could make a phone call. I heard her on the phone with my grandma in the other room telling her that she walked in on me pointing to and talking to my aunt, and when she walked in it smelled like her perfume that she used to wear before I was even born. When she came back out to the living room she was teary eyed and asked if I was scared and I said no, and she told me that one of the last conversations she had with her, my aunt told her that she would forever be there for me and do whatever she could to make me feel safe. Eventually I stopped seeing her and talking to her but I can still physically feel her presence around me mostly when i'm sad or going through rough times with my mental health. I still remember all of the times she visited me so vividly and i've talked to many therapists about it and they don't really have an answer. I'm not religious anymore so I haven't turned to anybody in a church to seek out an explanation but it's really comforting to know that I meant so much to her and that her energy is always with me.",

So, he decided that he would sleep in my bed and I would sleep in his with my mom. Eventually, I fell asleep and when I woke up the lady was standing beside me and I jumped and moved close to my mom.

All the usual suspects where there.  The landscape was the same.   As well as the flora and fauna.\n\nThey were many dozens of them.   They were having a party or maybe it was like a bar scene.  I'm not sure.\n\nOn thing for sure that surprised me.  They are JUST LIKE US.  They act just like us.  They play music and instruments like us.  In fact, in the bar, many of the song I heard were human songs.   Some were not, but many were.\n\nThey had phones.  Like, iPhones.  Of course there were not iPhones, but something very similar.\n\nAnd each had a small white dot on middle of the screen.  Somehow, they could activate that dot and from it would begin plotting out a physical mesh that became a permanent window to another place, the other place they \"called\" I assume\n\nThe were absolutely ecstatic that I could see them.   They kept come up to me and talking miles a minute and gesturing to take my picture.\n\nThey even video called.  Yes, they did.  And they would hold their \"phone\" with me in the back ground, like a selfie.  Whenever I would wave hello at the other parties on the call, usually several, they would go WILD that I could see them.   Jumping around like their team won the World Cup.   Waving and smiling back.  It was funny and kind.\n\nI can see them, but I can almost not hear them.   All I hear is a quiet muffle and sometimes a few words.    I can \"sort\" of feel them because they would sometimes touch my finger tips to see if I would react.  \n\nEach time, I would point at my ear and shake my head \"can hear you\".   Each time, they would write something on their \"phone\" and hold it up.\n\nIt was just too dark to see the screen.  But I could almost.  So, more to come.  We will work that out.    I wrote on my phone \"Can't hear you.   See you, but dark.   Your screen is too dim for me to read\".   I think this was not necessary because I think they could hear me fine.\n\nOne funny thing:  I have the large piece of art on my wall that says \"(my name) &amp; Company\"\n\nOn of the people there pointed at that sign and said \"(My Name)\" and &amp; company (pointing to all the people in the room).  Haha\n\nThey were kind.  Very happy.   Seemed to like to engage in a lot of open sex.   They have technology.   Also they could float when they wanted.\n\nNo one will believe me.  I don't care.   \n\nI see them.  I will see them again.\n\nI told them I would be back.",

        "text": "I've had encounters with each creature from above, I started to see gnomes when I was 12 or 13, they were small and ran across the floor, this has continued to happened without provoking or summoning.  My last encounter I was not the only one who saw it my friend and I were sitting on my porch and one humanoid figure ran by, It was too small to be a human with those capabilities. Shadow people have always been a problem, my mom said when I was a baby one figure hovered over me. I have tried taking videos of them and I have had technical difficulties where they can not be captured and the video no longer loads and works. They have been ranging in heights but are usually tall. They are dark but have humanoid figures. I see them more clearly in sleep paralysis but when I am awake I see them as well. My last memorable sleep paralysis shadow figure hovered over me they resembled the figure of death. I've had feeling of levitating during paralysis and getting blankets taken off me, along with waking up in weird positions like laying horizontally in bed when i go to sleep vertically. When they are around I feel anxious and fearful. I pray in hopes they will leave. In terms of ghost I have seen a pale woman with a face dressed in dark clothing in my home. They were there for a moment and left. I am concerned due to my use of the Ouija board in my home. I had two childhood homes that were haunted. One a boy lived there, there was foot steps and you would see the boy at times. We moved, in this home things would move by themselves, items will fly off counters and shelves. My mom would see it as would I.   In terms of witches my mom and dad both practiced one day I went to the woods and saw a witch or what I believe to be one, I was in a wooded area by myself going on a walk and in the trees I saw a woman wearing a black dress that was very layered they were not flying more just levitating I pretended to not see it and quickly walked away outside of the woods, when i looked back the woman was on the side of the trail there was not a possibility that it could have gotten there so quickly it did not make contact other than stare. Unlike the woman i perceive as a ghost, this entity was solid, they looked like a human and were aged but had capabilities that were not human. Lastly, i make painting and draw but i have terrible experiences making them. I will see shadow people around me crawling on the walls which in turn makes me destroy all my art because I think it releases evil. I slept on the couch last night and I heard a voice coming from near my last painting. I feel eerie when looking at it. It is hung in the living room behind the couch. As i laid down I heard my roommates voice from behind me. I knew he was not behind me because he was sleeping in his room. It kept calling me and I did not respond. I try to never respond. I don't know why supernatural encounters keep happening.  If any one has any way I could decrease the encounters from happening please help.",

But now that i am a young adult (?) i am curious about it. \n\nWhenever we watch tv series or movies (anything) i knew who‚Äôs gonna be the villain, hero (protagonist and anta), who‚Äôs gonna died, and what is the plot twist. I was shocked that people don‚Äôt usually know what‚Äôs going to happen or GOING TO HAPPEN in movies/series. I thought they know what‚Äôs going to happen.\n\nI can also see what‚Äôs going inside the person (her feelings, thoughts, ideas etc)‚Ä¶ or if she/he will lie to me or is lying to me. O can not predict a certain future but i can see it but i‚Äôm not sure about it tho. That‚Äôs why i feel alone most of the time because i know what‚Äôs going on inside them esp that i know my parents feelings. I also feel that i have no friends because of the things i see in them. (Humans are not perfect..they said so i just had to carry it all along after all we are all humans). \n\nI can also know what‚Äôs going to happen in the next moment. Or if this person going to be great someday or will be famous. \n\nI also know if this person is going to teach me or guide me in my life. \n\nIf you have read this far, please let me know about your perspective (no hates allowed i‚Äôm sensitive)  I just want to know your answers. Thank you. And yes. Ghosts is real but they only appear in the eyes of childrens and animals and if you do have contact with them then just leave them be or if they haunt you that‚Äôs evil and u might want to leave ur house).",

Nothing there, I didn‚Äôt have a cat at the time.\n\nExperience 2: Time goes on, and I got a real cat. At some point, I started noticing something jumping on the bed every night and walking around me. It felt exactly like a cat walking around the bed, except my cat was either laying next to me or on the chair near me. I could even feel chills like it was breathing on me when it got close to my face. This became a nightly occurrence.\n\nExperience 3: Some time in the night, I wake up out of a dream. When I open my eyes, I see a ghostly looking cat laying on my chest with its head pointing away. It instantly notices me, turns and looks at me, and then jumps off and disappears on my bed‚Äôs headboard. I actually felt it jump off of me.\n\nSome other bits to wrap up: We had a plumber inspecting the basement and foundations He found 6 cat corpses from when they were apparently getting in during the winter but couldn‚Äôt get out. There were other strange things happening like cabinets opening on their own, specific lights dimming at the same time, etc.\n\nI ended up moving and all the experiences stopped. Sometimes I wonder if the cat(s) just wanted comfort and what could be done to lay their spirits to rest.",

        "text": "Sorry for the long post in advance. Thank you for reading.\n\nI've always felt like I can tell the difference in energies in certain places. These are some of my experiences: \nWhen I lived in a flat when I was about 12/13 I felt like I was being watched from particular doors and I had a sense it was an old man. Then I've had the feeling of being rushed down the stairs with someone pushing on my back. When my stepnan died I dreamt she visited me; she walked through the door with a purple aura around her and a few other people came through after her that I didn't recognise. The room was pure white ( white door, floor, walls, sofas, tables etc). It felt extremely real and I had to come round for 10 minutes after because I couldn't tell if it was reality or not. I've had a few more dreams like this but its always about a loved one going missing although I eventually find them. When I was a child I drew a picture of a woman, and my stepfather (who can see things) said she was my spirit guardian. Currently in the house I live a few months ago I was convinced someone was watching me from the wardrobe, every night I would feel like someone was touching my arm as if stroking me. I also had an alarm clock turn on without anyone being near it, like when you touch the button and it beeps. About 10 years ago I slept at my nans and held hands with someone while laid in her bed for over 15 minutes when I was on my own. I've walked down a road with the feeling my feet were burning to later find out years later that at the top of the street a woman and her kids died in a house fire. My cat currently runs away for days at a time and I could spend over half an hour shouting him but when I ask for help from my nannan and grandad (who died 3 years ago) he comes to me within 5 minutes. \nIf you've made it this far, can I sense things or is it all in my head?",

        "text": "I will try to sort the events chronologically, they happened between my 14 and 20 years of age, for context I am currently 22. The village in question is called M√≥jcza, it is less than a kilometer from the city of Kielce, Poland. I have also not lived there for two years.  \n\n\nAn important thing I want to mention is a warm friend of mine I met here, Jacob, who will be crucial to several situations.  \n\n\n1. The forest itself was huge although typical of forests in Poland. My friend and I often spent our free time there. The forest had no owner, and we loved exploring it. We built a small bridge by the stream so that we didn't have to go around it or jump over it. A few days after building it, when we were returning home from deeper parts of the forest, as if from a tree, a stone flew towards me, which almost hit me in the head. At the time and for a long time afterwards we joked about it, although it was a dangerous situation. Of course, we ignored it.\n2. It was harvest time, as I remember there were bales of hay in the fields at the time, which we loved to jump over. We chose fields that were more submerged in the woods so as not to risk being caught by farmers. It was already getting dark, more slowly sunset. On our return we saw a black figure, behind a small stream (Different from point 1, this forest is repeatedly crossed by water). We looked at the figure for a while, but did not care about it at the time. We even laughed that it was the figure that threw the stone then.\n3. We saw this figure again, twice on another day, shortly after the previous incident, in the same areas. \n4. This is the last part where my friend was with me. In the deeper parts of the forest we found something like rabbit holes, only bigger. We have seen rabbit den quite often, so I doubt we could have been wrong. Nearby we found a traveling suitcase, with strange things inside. From that moment on, my friend stopped attending this forest.\n5. I myself enjoyed running through the forest, in other parts of it, especially in the evening. I came across a phenomenon that I would most simply describe as earth-breathing. In a certain area, the ground regularly rose and fell. \n6. And this is where things started to get weird. I covered my running route as usual, but on this day I turned back. While running, I heard an unnatural growl from the bushes (Over the years I've clocked wolves or foxes, it sounded much different). There seemed to be nothing in the bushes. I preferred not to tempt fate and turned back home. The growl itself was deep, very bass.\n7. Last, and probably the strangest thing. I was already of age. It was dark, my one of the few trips after dark. I don't even remember what for. Passing a long path in the woods, I heard not far away but in a denser part a kind of choir, something like church singing. I'm not an expert but it sounded like it was in Latin. I ignored it, going back I didn't hear anything anymore.  \n\n\nYears later, my friend and I came to the conclusion that there were probably black masses or something of that nature. There were also often suspicious cars hanging around in the area for years. I'm not a big believer myself, but who knows.  \n\n\nP.S. Forgive me, but my English is not at the highest level.",

I had to leave otherwise I would‚Äôve been late and took my spare key out of my bag and locked my door. When coming back home I then had to renter through the window and onto my bed. When going to look for it again I had found it underneath a pillow below the window. My bed was made before I tore my room apart and it definitely wasn‚Äôt there. Friday I lost it again and found it on the ground underneath a bag on the floor with clear view from the door. I have told my Mum about this and she doesn‚Äôt believe me. \nHas anyone experienced this and what can I do about it?\n\nPs.

She was thrown about the car slamming her head on both front side windows and then landing behind the driver's seat. her spirit was left in this limbo state just like bright white but greying area where we were our physical forms. I somehow was there with her in that realm and letting her know she had to scream and scream and try to find her way back but she can get back to us and tried to reassure her to not panic just get back in her body. Something snapped me out of the dream and I just start bawling.\n\nMy husband asks me what was wrong and I tell him the dream. Really shook up I took a shower to try to calm down. I finally get back to sleep and 45 min later we get a phone call.\n\nMy sister in law was in a car crash. Put into a medically induced coma after hitting her head and on breathing machines. She wouldn't come out the coma for a few days (the time in the hospital was moving extra slow but also somehow so fast it's a blur). \n\nIt's still the spookiest thing that's ever happened to me. I had felt other intense feelings after dreams like when my aunt died or grandmother in law died, but those were just feelings I got that they left and we were expecting them to pass more or less. I had also had premonitions before of really mundane stuff honestly, very random and mostly unimportant. this was like watching it in real time from the backseat but the it was the wrong person's face and the in-between void was both pleasant and unnerving with a lot of anxiety.\n\nWe've talked about it and she doesn't remember anything from that time. I don't like to talk about it and I still get flashbacks to that dream I had, but now the face is just a blur. It still really upsets me if I dwell on it too much",

        "text": "From a young age I had been introduced and involved with the idea that there may be something beyond living things, such as spirits, ghosts, etc. I would see the occasional shadow person, or experience the unexplainable, but what happened on this night truly tops everything. \nOctober 8th, 2021. I had been sitting in my living room confiding in the movie I was watching. From the place I had been sitting, you could see the front door, meaning you could see if someone was there or not. We also had a doorbell camera that would notify me that there was motion detected, even cars. Knowing this, what I had seen truly makes no sense.\nA ‚Äúwhite car‚Äù had abruptly stopped in-front of my house, typically I would brush this off because people randomly stop by my house on the daily. But it was the dead of night, and my neighborhood is quiet.\nMy house is positioned in a way where you could even feel someone dribbling a basketball from outside. This would come to explain why I was able to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù something, or rather someone, trudging down the sidewalk by my house. \nLater I would come to find out that my older brother had claimed to have heard this so called person scream whilst getting out of the car. His room is in the front of the house, meaning that he could have seen this whole ordeal go down. Unfortunately this is not the case, he had only seen the car peel off into the night after the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù had screamed and ran away. \nMy brother and I were the only ones to have seen this happen, we even turned to our mother who had access to our front door camera footage. You would think that this camera would come in handy right? Well unfortunately that very camera had nothing to show. When we looked at the doorbell camera, it was just darkness. Nothing seemingly abnormal, no white car, and definitely no woman in distress. The most definite thing I could point out about the footage was that it looked like it had been altered in a way, as if it were copy and pasted. \nThis is as far this story goes unfortunately, seeing as that I have yet to learn anything new. I am left with more questions rather than answers.",

He looked at the bathtub and in it were mine, my brothers and my mothers heads, floating in blood.\nHe said when he first came over to our old house he recognised the tiles in the bathroom from his dream.\nI mentioned it to my mum and she just says \" Yeah he's told me about that too\" uhm ok üò≥.\nHonestly if I was in her shoes I probably would have left him over that.

        "text": "So, we have lived in our house for about 3 years. The house and our neighborhood are only about  20 years old, with no relevant history that I know of. The previous owners had a teenage son who died while they lived here but not in (or near) the house. The couple never recovered understandably, their life spiraled with one heartbreak after another and they ended up divorcing a handfulofyears after their son died. There was very angry writings in red matker on our bedroom doors that indicated the wife had been unfaithful. The whole house was very unkept, except for one room, which was IMMACULATE and empty.  I guess I've never added up all the details til now because as I'm typing, I keep going back to 'no relevant history', but that just doesn't seem so with the negative energy and soul crushing sorrow the previous owners endured.  Anyway, we have a TV in our bedroom that randomly turns on nearly every day/night at all different times. Our closest neighbors who face the side of our house where our bedroom is are way out of remote control  range with their house being 200-225 ft away. Could this be an actual TV malfunction or something else?  Any questions or ideas welcome! Thanks in advance!",

I can't add a drawing of my apartment layout, so I'll explain it to the best of my ability. When you walk into the apartment, to your left is the living area and to your right is the dining room in front of you is the hallway and the hallway bends left (after a few feet) before the bend there's a room and the door goes back a little and kinda disconnects from the hallway. After the bend is my room door on the right (so you can see it from in between the dining and living area)  \n\nI was in my friends apartment, which is a mirror image of my apartment. This friend of mine has had these odd dreams for almost a year now. In these dreams, he sees the same lady with a silk white nightgown. Her hair is dark, and she has a long Bob. A few times, this lady has helped him, but more so, she tries to make him fail. But normally, she hangs out in the background. When she was trying to save him in this one dream, she grabbed his wrist and where her hand was it burned. When I was over there, I was walking out of his room and he was standing in front of the hallway (in between the dining room and the living area) he turned around and dropped the plate he was holding and his jaw dropped. He saw her sitting in a chair in the living area. He blinked and she was gone. A few days later, I went over again, and I was standing in the same spot he was that time, and I turned to look down the hallway and saw a lady flying threw the wall (in front of where the one door disconnects), she had a dirty white layered dress, and dark layered-ish hair. And she just flew across the hallway. \n\nI was in the same friends apartment, but I was standing in the part where it turns left, past my friends door) and I turned around to face where I had seen the lady but this time I saw a very tall dude who looked like pinocchio, he was definitely over 6ft. Believe I've seen him twice but I can't remember the other time. (That was the first time I saw he so it was more shocking. Therefore, I remember it better) \n\nThis is my first time posting on here, and these stories are Definitely, not as crazy as some things I've read on here, but I still wanted to share!",

        "text": "Hi, I'm sorry if this a lot but I really just needed to get this off my chest because I need outside perspectives so I can maybe sleep just a bit better at night? I was a crew member on a popular fantasy show that was recently filmed in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic. I never believed in ghosts or paranormal activity, but what happened on set has completely changed my mind. It all started with small things - equipment malfunctioning for no apparent reason (we had to reshoot multiple times), strange noises when filming on location at the castle-like estate, and the feeling of being watched when no one else was around. But things quickly escalated as crew members and a few actors began reporting sightings of ghostly figures on location, and some even claimed to have felt physical pushes from what was seemingly nothing.\n\nThe producers tried to brush it off as \"set jitters,\" as \"apparently\" nothing like this had happened during the previous season, but it soon became clear that something was seriously wrong as a lot of us were replacing other people's jobs who didn't return for production, including some of the leading actors who were completely replaced. We were told by higher-ups that the studio had hired a paranormal investigator to come and check things out, but they found nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThings came to a head when wrapping production on a night shoot in the forest, where multiple members of the production crew and I all witnessed terrifying hooded and ominous apparitions in the forest that vanished right before our eyes as quickly as they appeared. Everyone was terrified and despite all of these events being brought up to our superiors, the studio carelessly continued with production and more and more people were experiencing strange things on set. More people began reporting more frequent sightings of ghostly figures and alarming physical sensations. The studio's decision to continue production despite the obvious danger to the cast and crew only added to the eerie and terrifying atmosphere on set until the last day of production. Nobody got seriously hurt, but the entire experience is still so haunting to think about.\n\nThe true horror of the situation is that everything is being kept under wraps. This popular fantasy show had plans for several future seasons as obvious from the finale, but it has since been cancelled and left on one of the most devastating cinematic cliffhangers I've ever seen, leaving fans absolutely devastated to the point that it was a trending topic. One of the creators involved in the show, who rarely speaks out on social media, had to make a statement to help bury what happened, after one of the producers delivered the news in an abrupt and confusing manner on social media saying there was a bright side to the series being axed. The studio behind the show is determined to bury the truth about what happened during filming, and many of the cast and crew are too terrified to speak out. The events that occurred on set were so terrifying that plenty of others who I've spoken to on my team said they would never go back to those locations. The studio's desire to bury the show and pretend it never happened only adds to the eerie feeling surrounding the situation. It's clear that the safety and well-being of the cast and crew were not a priority for the studio, and it's a tragedy that such a promising show had to end in such a traumatic way.\n\nTo add onto this, allegedly the studio tried to bury the buzz about the show for months, hoping their lack of advertisement would contribute to low viewership so they could to fool the public into believing that nobody was watching it so they could cancel it without anyone suspecting anything. There was a very specific scene in the show that where a character jokingly name drops the streaming service as this scene was supposed to be in an advertisement, but they never used it in the marketing which was a clear indication that they wanted this series to fade away. When they saw the series still had large viewership predictions for the fall premiere because of the existing fanbase, they released a new, controversial show at the same time and spent a lot of money on advertising to make sure it was more popular, so their cancellation looked like it was due to low viewership in comparison to \"new records\". It's really a shame that the studio is more concerned with protecting their reputation than being transparent and honest with the public about what happened.\n\nThis studio still won't give the public a direct explanation from their words as to why the series was cancelled as they don't want to draw more attention to it, and the actors and production team is being tight-lipped about it. I never believed in the paranormal/unexplainable before, but I do now, and I still have nightmares about what I saw that day. It's a shame that such a promising show had to end this way and that hundreds of people (myself included) lost their jobs. I'm too afraid to ever consider returning to Ireland ever again and I'm not sure what to do, I just had to get this off my chest because it's seriously bothering me.",

I would be also rationalizing it and trying to explain it if it hadn‚Äôt happened to me. It was such a simple thing that was so factual that there‚Äôs no way I imagined it. \n\nI‚Äôm also not changing any details because I was so shocked by this that I kept replaying the event in my head over and over telling people every single detail every single time to not forget the way it happened.\n\nAnyways, almost 10 years ago when I was a teenager living with my dad, step mom and step sister I woke up on a Saturday morning. My step mom and step sister were gone every Saturday for my step sisters cheerleading practice. My dad was making a traditional breakfast soup from my country of origin and woke me up to eat it. On the way from my room I passed by the kitchen to grab an individual placemat (made out of plastic). I carried it with my hand vertically and put it on the table, placed my elbows on top of it. I glanced at it for a second to make sure my pajamas wouldn‚Äôt get dirty in case it was unwashed or stained from last nights dinner. It was clean.  I put my elbows on top and started scrolling on my phone. After a few minutes, my dad came with the soup walking slowly holding it with both hands as he tends to fill the bowl all the way up. At that moment he placed the soup down, on top of the placemat, I took my elbows out of the way and saw a line of salt next to the bowl. \n\nIt wasn‚Äôt scattered but clearly defined like somebody had cut a bag of salt‚Äôs corner and made a line with precision. It was a centimeter wide and about ten centimeters long. I looked at my dad and said : and this? He said idk, did you put salt there? I said no, and pointed out the fact that there was no salt shaker on the table. He went to grab a new placemat as I just sat there wide eyed saying but how the fuck did it appear there? I asked him if he had maybe salt stuck to his hand while cooking, he said no his hands and the bowl were clean. Also the line of salt was about five centimeters away from the bowl and there was no scattered salt between the bowl and the line of salt. My dad told me to get over it and eat and I was like but how!!!?? Random salt appearing out of NOWHERE!!!?? \n\nI brought it up several times to him and just said to stop thinking about it. Obviously I haven‚Äôt. Ever since then I don‚Äôt consider myself an atheist but more of an agnostic. I don‚Äôt know the meaning of it or if I will ever find an explanation. I read another post about salt appearing randomly in this forum and decided to post after so many years. It was fucking crazy.",

        "text": "Hey everyone! I'm glad to be here and boy do I love reading paranormal stories! I have a few that I'd like to share here from my old house.\n\nSo our last house was a townhouse, and I believe one family before us lived there. To my knowledge no one died there, but our neighbor in the house across from us passed away there, and we also lived walking distance from a cemetery.\n\nThe way the house was laid out, it was 4 floors. Bottom floor was basement, main floor was living area, kitchen, dining room. 2nd floor was my bedroom, parents bedroom, laundry room. Top floor was attic/loft type space with walk in closet which was my sisters room.\n\nSince my sisters room was the entire top floor, part of it was directly above my bedroom. This is your pretty standard paranormal stuff, but whenever my sister was at work, I'd hear distinct footsteps from upstairs. I don't mean the *house settling* BS, but it was feet dragging across carpet footsteps, as if someone refused to pick their feet up off the floor.\n\nThe next one is when I was about 9 or 10, I always wanted to sleep with my sister in her room despite having my own room. Eventually she got tired of me sleeping with her, so that night my parents made me sleep alone. I was laying in bed crying and upset. In the middle of me crying, directly in my ear, I hear \"shhh\".\n\nNow for this next one, I was sitting in bed on my laptop. My bedroom was perpendicular to the hallway. My door was open, and in my peripheral vision, I saw what appeared to be a figure poke its head into my bedroom, then retreat. I looked up after this and called out for anyone, but no one was there.\n\nThis one may be the scariest one, but this one is at least a bit rational. I was asleep one early morning, and was woken up to the sound of someone whisper screaming in my ear \"WAKE UPPPPPPP!!!\" and I felt as though I was being shaken. This one may be written off as a half sleep/half awake hallucination, but it was still freaky.\n\nSince moving to my current house I haven't really experienced anything. Thanks for reading!",
