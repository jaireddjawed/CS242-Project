        "text": "So it seems like the Seraphim (and sometimes King) have their flames go off only when they are attacking. Some examples of this are S-Hawk trying to attack Luffy's group with Daz Bones' df\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brqcgo7a4mma1.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=90f765550b541159d6e0e4643bc18535984c7592\n\n S-Shark trying to attack Nami\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Nami vs S-Shark](https://preview.redd.it/m3cwvkci4mma1.png?width=506&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=00d181d404c3ddce9bdd8a60bbd52fbcb76f678e)\n\n and King anytime he uses Tempura Udon\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[tempura udon](https://preview.redd.it/zft5q78k5mma1.png?width=563&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=02c84fe45b4b9a6c31f2660a54c1dcd2d0fd2f18)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe saw this previously also when we first met S-Shark and he attacked Nami, his flames went off then too and basically anytime he was charging in to go attack. Interestingly though when the seraphim shoot out projectiles that don't need physical strength to use, the flame on their backs remain on, always e.g shooting lasers \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[S-Snake beam](https://preview.redd.it/lutv3qw45mma1.png?width=491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b131e84414d12414bcd2cd0cbcb344145a86da7b)\n\nThe Question most fans have been wondering though is, why even go into speed mode? why does every lunarian always go out of defence mode?\n\nMy theory is that lunarians only have a default mode(defence) and a offense mode(flame off). In their default state with the flame on their backs, lunarians are super durable as we know, but when they switch to their offense mode their offensive abilities all get a huge buff or you could also say in defense mode their offensive abilities are nerfed, either way in order to attack at their full power they need to turn the flames off. The reason this happens is because switching to offense mode builds up some explosive energy inside the lunarians, which the lunarians can convert into a burst of speed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[King using speed](https://preview.redd.it/1g3j8wpi6mma1.png?width=794&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8643163799fbab7f9372c533cd60d3800e68086e)\n\nor power\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[S-hawk suddenly overpowering Zoro after having been easily stopped by Zoro prior](https://preview.redd.it/9yinxl9r6mma1.png?width=538&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f3590758eeb34f221053433a706d1b6226a51f74)\n\nDue to needing to switch to offense mode in order to create this type of energy, that is why King didn't just overwhelm Zoro with speed in their fight, King's speed is more of a burst than him full on becoming Barry Allen. The lunarian can also decide to not use this built up power through increasing their speed or strength, and instead go back into defence mode and just use that energy to blow themselves up, as experienced by Zoro:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[King exploding](https://preview.redd.it/itonf0iu7mma1.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e932b574527ea7ff794a5a4b744343930301c342)\n\nDefault mode allows them to survive this explosion, due to their high defence, and they additionally do major damage to any enemies near by.\n\nThe flame on the backs of the lunarians is some kind of special fire, it might even be the fire Lilith was talking about with an absurdly amount of energy and when it's outside the lunarian's body it strengthens the power of their skin to crazy levels which explains why attacks on their skin have no effect but this means internally damaging attacks would, like potentially Zoro's conquerors haki infused attacks. And when the fire gets absorbed inside the lunarian's body their skin is no longer empowered but they gain the explosive energy that can be used to make a more powerful attack, move faster or just release the energy as is causing the lunarian to explode.",

Having her bond with Tama was really sweet and showed her motherly side, so maybe a bit more of that or having her defend Toko more prominently during Orochi's banquet, could have been cool as well. But aside from that, there's not much more that I think could be done with Nami in this arc. \n\nNow, as for during the raid, I'd actually would have preferred if we had gotten her a bit more into the spotlight. She had some of her best moments ever during this Arc (when she told Ulti that Luffy will definitely become the Pirate King, and when she stood up to Kaidou after he came down from the rooftop), so everything else would just be the cherry on top of an already marvelously written character arc for her. \n\nFor example, all she did during her \"fight\" with Ulti was to spam Thunderbolt. I personally would say that her and Usopp's movesets could have made the battle against the two siblings into a really interesting one where two weaker people stat-wise (Nami and Usopp) win against their stronger, yet relatively simple-minded opponents with their wits and skills. What we got instead was them running across the castle for... long. I'm just under the impression that it could have been done a bit more thematic and interesting if we actually got to see Nami and Usopp's arsenal bounce off of one another. \n\nOther smaller things that I think could have been done with her: her making a comment or explaining Wano's diverse/weird climate; her being shocked at the revelation that Tama is a Kurozumi and her getting extra angry at Orochi for treating his own family in such a way; her \"using\" Zeus in a more varied way during the Arc aside from slapping Ulti once and redirecting lightning (maybe she could have actually helped with the fire in Onigashima, at least a little bit); her potentially awakening her Haki. \n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10suysq/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_hawkins_in/) \\- Hawkins\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10v431h/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_the_kid_and/) \\- Kid and Heart Pirates\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10x4ha4/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_orochi_in/) \\- Orochi\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/10yw5h6/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_zoro_in/) \\- Zoro\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/111isx9/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_yamato_in/) \\- Yamato\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11b1wt7/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_franky_in/) \\- Franky\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11icj17/you_have_the_opportunity_to_write_tama_in/) \\- Tama",

I don’t know if the Reddit side has talked about it already but Blackbeard is in my eyes something that shouldn’t exist yet no one WG, or Pirates seems to really care that he has done something thought to be and known impossible. Hosting two DFs Blackbeard doesn’t give me the scientific vibes so it’s has to be some crazy method but his also stealing and give df powers. His unpredictable and unconventional worse then shanks in my opinion.\n\nCaptain Kid and Red Hair Shanks definitely a heavy opponent to face along with a vendetta since they took your arm before you seen him last time. I don’t think kids weak though he has clear trust issues after the betrayal on not 1 but two of the worse generation. Teamed up with law and luffy but still held back granted law and luffy have a longer bond. The lack of story this may be where he dies and I think that would give luffy a reason to face shanks because he does consider kid his friend. On the sides he lives i think the straw hat fleet will be his “backup / support” since they both have outlying issue with shanks.  \n\nlet me know what y’all think",

Dont get me wrong, I'm glad Oda pulled the trigger and actually followed through with some deaths but this was not only very out of character for Oda and such a random time to actually make this decision. As you all know, we had 2 very big fakeout deaths which is expected at this point, but to retract these deaths only to randomly reveal that Izo and Ashura Doji died of their wounds at the end of the arc is just so weird to me. What is the significance of this from a writing standpoint? If anything, the whole situation is a major curiosity/oddity for me when it comes to the series.

Sure, we know Zoro was a bounty hunter before, we saw Yosaku and Johnny, or Daz Bones who used to be a bounty hunter . Abdullah and Jeet introduced in the Dressrosa arc also come to mind, but aside from them and some filler characters and groups i feel like in the world of One Piece we lack bounty hunters who can actually go toe to toe with the real heavy hitters of the New World. Why give dangerous individuals high bounties above the 1 billion Berry mark, if no one is strong enough to collect those anyway, aside from Marines and the World Gov. of course. Don't even get me started on the Yonko Bounties still active. I like the idea of bounties being a reflection for an individuals notoriety, threat and strength scaling but i feel like outside of those aspects, they don't really serve a real purpose if no one but other pirates are going after the big guns for the sake of fame. And it's even weirder because we know that there are powerful individuals out there who are or were associated with neither Marines, Revolutionaries, Government or Pirates. Just look at the military draft during the timeskip, where they seemingly pulled Aramaki and Issho from nowhere and promoted them to the Admiral rank. That alone should give the possibility for powerful characters that could very well be bounty hunters but we just literally never see any strong bounty hunters in this story. But that's just my perspective, what do you guys think?",

        "text": "We have seen Luffy and our crew being tested to their absulute limits physically, mentally and emotionally but rarely of other already established big named characters. What first comes to mind for example is when i wonder who was mohawks first defeat, biggest rival, hardest obstacle to pass. Who was their along, Lucci, don flamingo, katakuri, sabady archipelago (rock bottom) of their story. Obviously this isn't applied to just mihawk but i wonder what struggles and enemies the admirals, some yonko,  former warlords,etc  have fought to get where they were at their prime. Its just an interesting to think about as we the viewer see these pirates as their finished product but never for the most part get to witness their journey it took to get where they are.",

Obviously if not for Luffy's inherent immunity to him he would be a major threat as his devil fruit has to be of the same tier as the Navy admirals.\n\nAre we seeing him in the same tier as Katakuri? As Doflamingo or other Shichibukai like Boa Hancock or Jinbei? Is he admiral level? One could argue his devil fruit is as destructive or more than Kaido's but I don't think a case for strength similarity could be made there. \n\nWhat do we think.\n\nPersonally I'd say he's right at the level of Katakuri or King in regards to how he could match up against the rest of the relevant New World pirates.",

I thought the point of her stealing money was because of kokoyashi village and her wanting to buy it from arlong and free her people but after that she's still a money hungry thieving bitch..and sanji pre timeship he was a kinda a simp  but you could call it being a gentleman he was smooth and charming with swag after timeskip he's mega simp and pervert, chopper is no longer a character just a mascot.Ussop is so annoying I'm a brave warrior x100 but a pussy when shit hits the fan he had his one moment in arlong park and alabasta but that's it..robin isn't massacred yet..brook needs something new I'm tired of the same panties, I'm already dead yohohoho jokes it's not funny anymore..most of arcs are completely skippable and lose no important information  at all all in all one piece is boring sack of repetitive cliches and gags",
