I also sometimes drive her home or pick her up and sometimes she does the same for me. So we've been spending more than eight hours together just the two of us and this has been going on for four months. I don't have romantic feelings for her, she also has a long-term boyfriend.  \n\nI worked from home too but because I've been training her we agreed  to come to the office and I've done everything to make her feel comfortable and I've dedicated way too much time on her and I needed to work free overtime to make up on my own tasks. I could have just refused to come to the office, but after wasting all that time ( and money on lunch / transit live far away from work )  just to help someone out I feel like an idiot for not getting invited to her birthday party. I was actually helping her shop for party supplies after work, she told me she's inviting 20 people over for her birthday party. Am I out of line or an asshole to think that I should have been invited ? This may be childish but honestly this is bugging me I don't know what to do. I'm so pissed over this I don't even care if I argue with her / employeer and just switch jobs. Just want to know why I wasn't invited.  I even bought her a gift supposed to give it to her tomorrow. Will probably just give it to her and work from home from monday.",

Now it just said my name with a funny acronym  with my actual name being alireza and it saying Alinorizzah (Ironic right) but I feel like she didnt send me a friend because of who I am but because im just sped snd they wsnt to be friends with the \"Sped kid\"\n\nI want to finally be able to know people dont view as a socially dumb,sped person and the person I want them to view with actuall banter instead of mean teasing.

And also when I just try to be chill and not think and say thing spontanously, I end up saying things that do not resonate with who I really am.  Like they just come out wrong or something that could accidentally be considered criticism. I would also start to overanalyze whether something I say truly resonates with me (usually never need to do that (maybe OCD?)). I'll also feel really awkward not only saying, but doing things, because they also seem to come out wrong or unnatural for whatever reason. \n\nThe problem with this thing is that it still sometimes affects me in social situations these days (just the pure fear of helplessness when I try to say or do something but it all starts going WRONG and I can't fix it with my behavior). Just now while writing this, I have this uncomfortable feeling, while I feel stiff and not even myself, because I think maybe I should phrase things differently in this post.\n\nMaybe there's a term for what I described? Any help welcome!",

I could just be trying to give simple advice and next thing I know people I talk to get all mad or I get temporarily banned for being rude when I genuinely don't mean to. I hate talking anymore. I feel like everyone hates me. I have social anxiety and adhd and it makes me feel so alienated from everyone. I just got temporarily banned from the one subreddit where I can vent about my adhd because I said something i didn't realize was a rule breaker and it honestly sucks. Anytime I speak I upset everyone. I just want to be able to speak to people without sounding rude. I work as a cashier at a gas station and I feel like anytime I try to correct someone or make a joke they get all mad. I'll be honest my social skills absolutely suck because I was never taught any as a child and I've been socially neglected all my life. In school I had one friend and I found out that person wasn't a good person and was just using me to look better and it flushed my reputation in my small community down the toilet. Now I can't make any friends. Someone recently asked me in person if they wanna be friends. We went to my house got food played games it was great. But then the serious conversations came up. Next thing I know I'm coming off as an extreme feminist jerk when I genuinely didnt even mean to because I'm horrible at wording things. Ever since then they haven't called or texted me back. I blew my one chance at making a friend in my neighborhood because I don't know how to talk correctly. Now I'm all alone and have no one to talk to so i tried using reddit as a coping mechanism. Big mistake because now everyone on here hates me too and I didn't even mean for anything to come off the wrong way. I feel like I'm stepping on eggshells when doing any social interaction in fear that I'm gonna make someone angry. How can I redeem myself? How the hell do you talk to people without making them mad? I'm genuinely a good person but no one ever stays around long enough to get to know me. I just wanna make friends and feel wanted. I feel so alone and isolated and it's driving me insane. I could really use advice on how to communicate properly because I have no idea what I'm doing that's coming off the wrong way.",

I felt off afterwards and ended up blocking/unfriending them all.\n\nThis year I have a good friend group, but I feel like an outcast. My partner was in the friend group before I was, despite me knowing them longer. I feel a little left out with other things too. I can‚Äôt stay up late and call like they do sometimes. I had major FOMO after not being able to attend one of my friend‚Äôs birthday parties for stupid reasons. I feel like they‚Äôd all be happy without me and not even notice.

        "text": "I've been struggling for some time now when it comes to meshing in with public and invite groups for hockey. I play as a goalie so I tend to fill in for other goalies on various teams, private games, and I also attend public games hosted by the city were people register and show up for an hour or so of hockey.\n\nI would say that I'm more introverted for the most part but I can be very social too. Finding some common ground can be a struggle off the bat because I'm really into tech, but also really enjoy playing hockey as a goalie while at the same time not really caring about what is on TV and which sport teams are winning or doing whatever. When other goalies are in my change room we instantly connect and talk about gear or anything related. The problem I seem to have is that I feel like an outsider when it comes to the players (not goalies) in every group I attend no matter how often I go to the same group, and I do understand as the fill in I'm not going to be best friends, but there feels like a lot of awkwardness in maintain a conversation.\n\nMy interactions are generally your standard \"hello\", and I'll compliment good plays and effort throughout the game, while joking around. I also ask people a lot about themselves to break the ice a bit more. Out of the many groups I've gone to I've only connected mostly with the goalies, and one player who also happened to be a programmer.\n\nWhen I reached out to the hockey community to get feedback I was pretty much told it is a \"me\" problem, and maybe it is because I suck at the game, or I'm just an awkward person.\n\nOn the flip side I can be much more social as I do have a regular group I attend and sometimes I need to bring out random goalies. When I reach out and meet up with them at the rink I introduce that goalie to everyone, we all joke around and have a good time before the game. Even during the warm up I skate over and we all chat it up and bit and have fun before the puck drops. After the game the goalies are always asking to come back and the environment just feels more positive.\n\nWhen I've subbed in for another goalie I've never been introduced to anyone, and it seems very awkward where I have to put in that 200% effort to even strike up a conversation but even then it still feels odd.\n\nI'm not really sure what to do, and it has started to impact my ability to get groups. I'm also starting to enjoy the sport a lot less because of this, and hockey being a team sport it really doesn't help when you're unable to mesh with the other players. I don't make inappropriate jokes, I don't get into anything controversial, and I usually just stick to talking about things in the now related to the game, and asking people about themselves.",

Since a young age I have thrived socialising, being the life of the party, never wanting to be alone and never getting tired of socialising with all types of people. This was the case regardless if I had a partner or not, depressed or not etc. \n\nFor the past couple months I have been feeling very vulnerable, indecisive and confused mainly to do with what I want to do with my life. A major thing I have noticed that is making me anxious and confused is I have basically stopped having the urge to see people. Whenever I do I regret it. I used to be super hedonistic, spontaneous, go with the flow type of person. Now I am just obsessed with routine and hanging with myself or my family. I still see friends from time to time but it has definitely lessened.\n\nI think it‚Äôs probably important to mention that I recently suffered from anorexia a couple years ago and now nearing the ends of my recovery (although not fully recovered mentally). I say this because even when I was anorexic I was still socialising not as much as my pre ED, but a lot more than now and wasn‚Äôt bothered by it. \n\nCurrently I am still getting invited to hangouts but I vigorously get anxious by the idea and how it will impact my time and routine especially because I feel like it doesn‚Äôt serve me like it used to. I love hanging with my parents because they support me, get me and let me do my thing so it‚Äôs just easy and satisfying but partying and even wholesome activities with my friends just feels forced if I go. I literally have to prepare in advance and think and plan about what I will do, what I will wear, what times we will do things and how I can make it the most comfortable for me. It‚Äôs becomes chore, I‚Äôm barely present and just get exhausted. I still do however get fomo especially when my partner is going to these hangs and I‚Äôm terrified he will just move on with out me because I‚Äôm stuck at home doing nothing but planning my days.\n\nI feel so unsure of myself and what makes me happy. The only way I can explain it is that if my friends cancel a plan and I know they are at home doing nothing I can feel better about doing the same. Selfish I know. \n\nWhy have I become this rigid, obsessed, uptight person who can‚Äôt be carefree anymore and just relax with friends without panicking before hand?",

I say this because I've made friends over the year and the one I feel the most at ease with has that style because we're looking for the same things in friendship. A lot of people I meet can be \"cold\" they're not cold tho it's just that the style isn't on the same wavelength so it's a bit harder and there's less affinity. Idk I just feel like anytime I'm around someone with any attachment style that doesn't mirror mine I just downplay my attachment and act all rough and hard while pretending to act normal around others when deep down I just want a hug and lots of affection (I've let a few things with him slip up, I've shown myself vulnerable compared to with others because the attachment feels secure, I can count on him and he can count on me) with everyone else it doesn't feel secure I overthink things and feel so anxious, I still try to be a good friend  to them too tho. Either way those are my two cents, do any of you feel something similar?",

        "text": "Hi, this issue has been bothering me for a long time, and I'm not sure what to do about it.\n\nI became friends with a girl in my college program during our first semester. We are now in 2nd semester. It is a difficult, fast-paced program, requiring lots of organization, initiative and commitment.\n\nAt first, this classmate and I got along well. We had things in common and spent a bit of time between classes together. Unfortunately, it didn't take too long for her to get on my nerves.\n\nShe lives about 1/2 hour drive from the school, while I am much further (45 mins to an hour with heavier traffic). She lives at home, drives her parents' luxuries cars whereas I drive my small compact car I share with my boyfriend. I have been living on my own and supporting myself for almost 14 years now.\n\nAt first she seemed quite hardworking, but quickly she devolved into a negative, complain-y type person? She's quick to get frustrated in our labs, asking for my help, whereas I'm trying to use our limited time to learn and get work done. In between classes she either drives home or plays Switch (if she forgot her Switch, she will complain). She is almost always late to class or doesn't show up for non-mandatory lessons (\"I'll just read the ppts\"). She has started to rely on me to tell her bits of info that the professors only tell us in person, and insinuates that it isn't worth her time to be there in person.\n\nEverything about her absolutely eats me up and fills me with a rage. I worked *so* hard to get into this program and continue to bust my ass and drive 2hrs every day, use all my spare time between class on schoolwork, pay attention as much as possible, take responsibility for my education and she just waddles around with a pissed off look on her face all the time. Whenever she has to do a technical skill (i.e. handle animals, inject a patient) she does it SO slowly and SO awkwardly, and almost like slapstick deadpans her movements so people around will laugh and think she's cute or funny or something?\n\nAnyways. I am rambling hard here. How do I make it known to this girl that I don't want to be her friend? Her presence and reliance on me is so draining and distracting to my mind; here I am on Reddit where I should be working. I know she's not being malicious and definitely has poor social skills and comes from unsupportive parents; I don't want to hurt her feelings, but at the same time I might have to? Her attitude is killing me.\n\nThanks for reading!\ntl,dr: Lazy clingy classmate has become increasingly annoying and I don't know how to deal",

        "text": "To start with I met this friend of mine around last year. I found it fun to talk to her as we had similar interests, same school and whatnot. Early in the friendship she complained that people ignored her texts and took too long to reply and complained about being lonely a lot. I did my best to try to be a good friend and offered to hang out and stuff, especially because she said people never asked her to hang out. However, I noticed she has started to do to me what she didn‚Äôt want others doing to her‚Ä¶.\n\nOne such example is that I feel like everything is always about her. She rants a lot in our GC with another mutual friend, and we always console her and cheer her up and try to motivate her and whatnot. However I noticed that I don't really get the same energy back from her when I want to rant about something, or if I talk about something I'm excited about. She kind of just ignores what I say, or gives one word replies.\n\nThe main thing that really causes me to feel hurt is lack of hanging out. Let me just explain, because of course I know people don't always have time to chill (especially because we're both in competitive programs). My friend used to rant about being lonely so I'd always reach out and be like yeah I want to hang out like let me know a good time (I have a decent amount more free time than her, which she knows) - but I never really got much followup. I tried to ask her about specific days too, but no result. The thing that confused me most was that she always has time for her other friends, like she is always socializing but for some reason doesn't want to hang with me :(. I know from our convos she'd invite over or go on cool meetups with people she literally just met, but with me it seems she never has any interest in following up on anything or initiating.\n\nLastly I feel like I am always getting ignored - I mentioned this earlier too. Whenever she shares an achievement or any issue in our GC I always speak up and say some kind words for congratulating and whatnot, and so does our other friend. But every single time she just ignores my messages and skips to the other friends. This happens for many things I say - often times if I ask or talk about something she just straight up ignores my messages and doesn't seem interested in talking, unless she has a problem she needs help with or something she's upset about.\n\nMy personal conclusion is such: I feel that I may be a boring person from her perspective - I didn't think this was the case as initially in our friendship these issues did not happen, but perhaps I am just not engaging enough, despite my efforts otherwise. Another issue could be that I see her as a close friend, but she does not reciprocate. I don't understand this since we do indeed talk about many personal things, so to be honest I have been very sad lately and need to get this off my chest. My solution is that maybe I should just not initiate convos with her anymore and slowly just drift off I guess - although it does pain me, but I think establishing some boundaries for myself is more important. I don't want to be used for people's rants I think its degrading.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n**tl;dr** My friend doesn't really give me the same energy I invest into her. I find that she ignores my texts, just randomly quits convos, and doesn't seem to every want to spend time with me or initiate any conversations. I feel like I just get used for ranting, because she rants quite frequently and always vents about personal issues.",

        "text": "There's a (relatively new) young professionals group/organization in my town designed for networking and socialization. I'm determined to put myself out there a bit more in 2023, so I want to attend the next mixer in February.\n\nIt will take place at a local bar that's a little bit upscale. Drinks available for purchase; snacks provided. \n\nI've never been to a bar, so apart from the regular anxiety of joining a social gathering, I'm anxious about that, too. If I were to buy a drink (likely nonalcoholic), do you pay for it right there at the moment, or is it like in the movies where there's a \"tab\" you have to pay at the end? LOL.\n\nAny additional tips for making small talk with strangers, remembering names, and making the experience enjoyable (rather than so stressful I never try again), would also be appreciated. I work from home, for a company based out of state, so I worry I'll be out of place in a group of people who work in the local community.",

        "text": "Okay so I know the point of exposing yourself to those uncomfortable social situations is to make you become more comfortable as time goes on. When I‚Äôm in a good mood I am a lot more likely to try it, but I never push myself too much when I‚Äôm in situations. I‚Äôm still holding back a lot. And it means the next time doesn‚Äôt get easier. Is there a way to make exposure an easier thing? How do I do it consistently? I literally only have like 1 social interaction a day lol",

        "text": "I just wanna vent a little.\n\nSo, to give you guys some background I am  20 years old, I recently moved out of my parent's house to study in another country, and I am currently living along with other students.\n\nThrough all of my life, I've always felt a little like an outcast, except maybe for a few years in high school. I have been bullied before, and since then, I became a very shy person and I struggle with connecting to people. Also, I might deal with mild social anxiety but I am always able to push myself through with it.\n\nI have some internet friends and I do have some friends irl too but I don't really feel conected to them (idk if it makes sense) \n\nAlso, I was and still am very close to my parents and I feel a lack of sense of identity outside of them. It's like I don't have an identity of my own, and I am struggling to figure out who I am.\n\nI have done therapy before and I would love to do it again but I am very broke so that's not an option for me right now. Can anyone give me some advice please?",
