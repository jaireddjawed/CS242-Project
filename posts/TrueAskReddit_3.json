The actress playing Ariel is black and they opted out of her having the traditional little mermaid hair and instead a different shade of red and I believe she has dreadlocks. \n\nI am not 100% sure but I’ve seen some other posts online about them doing a live action remake for Snow White where they again have done the same thing with casting. \n\nHad the opposite been done, for example, for the movie the princess and the frog then there would have been outrage. \n\nI understand that representation is important but why not make a new movie? Especially if, like I said, the opposite would not have been socially accepted. A white girl could not play the lead of the princess and the frog. \n\nI understand the historical atrocities of black face. I do not condone black face. I do not believe it’s okay to paint your skin black to mimic being a black person OR overly tan to play a black person for Halloween for example. \n\nSo why is the opposite accepted? Ie: the movie white chicks. Or most recently for the role of Wednesday Addams. \n\nIf it’s not okay one way it shouldn’t be okay the other way.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/z8erg9/why_cant_students_master_math_simply_by_passive/",
        "text": "Yearly, at least one student emails me this question, after wholly relying on passive reading then failing the exam. They successfully remember and can regurgitate everything from the textbook and lectures; can compute a question if analogous enough to something déjà vu, and something they saw before; and can prove straightforward corollaries. But they can't answer unseen, new-fashioned questions or trickier computations. They wholly fail to prove more abstract results.\n\n&gt;Students tend to *prefer* passive studying **because it's easier and more comfortable**. In fact, [this Harvard study](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2019/09/03/1821936116.full.pdf) shows that most students even convince themselves that passive methods are more effective, and that lecturing professors provide \"better learning\" than professors who engage students in-class projects, even though those hands-on projects ultimately provide much deeper education than traditional passive methods. [[Source]](https://www.brainscape.com/academy/active-studying-vs-passive-studying/)\n\n### But why precisely does passive study fail for learning math? Why can't math students simply read multiple textbooks on the same subject + DETAILED FULL solutions to exercises and problems, in lieu of picking up a writing implement and plugging away at exercises? \n\nI am seeking explanations more detailed, scholarly, and specific to math than [this](https://www.leonardoenglish.com/blog/passive-language-learning-is-bullshit). \n\n&gt;The reason is that learning is not a passive activity. As [some researchers](http://mjltm.org/files/site1/user_files_a9608a/admin-A-10-1-23-7c58f0c.pdf#page=125) have stated, \n&gt;\n&gt;_“Students cannot learn just by attending the classes, listening to teachers, memorising ready-made assignments, and producing answers. They must talk about what they are learning (output), write about it (integration), connect it to past knowledge, and use it in their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of their lives by practice.”_\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem with passive learning is that you [don’t engage with the information you receive.](https://universeofmemory.com/optimize-your-language-learning/) And that means you don’t learn it as well.\n\n&gt;This is not always so when recalling facts in a self-test—more effort is often required to bring the facts to mind, so they don’t seem as solid. From a student’s point of view, it can seem obvious which method—restudying—produces better learning. Robert Bjork refers to this as an “illusion of competence” after restudying. The student concludes that she knows the material well based on the confident mastery she feels at that moment.\n&gt;\n&gt;And she expects that the same mastery will be there several days later when the exam takes place. But this is unlikely. The same illusion of competence is at work during cramming, when the facts feel secure and firmly grasped. While that is indeed true at the time, it’s a mistake to assume that long-lasting memory strength has been created. - [Robert Madigan - How Memory Works](https://books.google.pl/books/about/How_Memory_Works_and_How_to_Make_It_Work.html?id=R3T3CQAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y).",

        "text": "I will never in my life understand the reasoning behind an ex/past hookup from my partners’ life reaching out and complimenting me out of the blue. In my experience, this has only ever happened with women. They’re usually people who have splitted on rocky terms with my partner or never reciprocated feelings for my partner. With my ex, three different women he used to be in cahoots with who I didn’t follow and didn’t personally know went out of their way to tell my boyfriend, to tell me, that I was pretty, attractive, or some other complimentary word.\n\nAs of recently, with my current boyfriend, I had briefly known a girl years back in University since we lived on the same floor in residency. We never really talked one-on-one and were only in the same place when we were with a group of people. She never once reached out to me but the second I started dating my now boyfriend she was messaging me “OMG you know ___?” “You guys are couple goals” “You’re so hot!”. Fast forward a week or so and I find out this girl had an on again off again situationship with my boyfriend for upwards of two years. \n\nEven just recently, another girl my boyfriend hooked up with messaged him saying how pretty my hair looked and I guess my question is, why? Why do women do this? I have never once had some weird urge to message someone from my past who I have no connection to anymore to compliment their partner, better yet message their partner who I don't know directly. Both of the women who have complimented me in my current relationship haven’t talked to my boyfriend for like three years, and one of them is a complete stranger to me.\n\nIt seems so odd, so off base and I’m struggling to understand the reason why some women do this. Does anyone have a possible reason why this happens or, if you’ve done it, why you felt the need to do so? I just think this is such an interesting phenomenon and after coming across a viral TikTok about it I just had to ask everyone here!",

If I’m committed to go through the gamut of any creator/unordered series/media, I try to get some semblance of a quality spectrum on the totality of works and go through them from worst to best.\n\nThis tends to pose a problem for a few reasons\n\n1. If there isn’t a particularly critical community or one that feels homogeneously about how various works rank, this is almost impossible (Not that common, but still causes me a lot of dismay when I try to figure out how to maximize enjoyment)\n2. Media ranks tends to blend together and I give myself some sense of FOMO in the spirit of “Well what if I read this 9/10 book before watching this 7/10 movie?” This is so silly since it’s inevitable that I'll never get a perfect order of best to worst so long as I'm adding new stuff to some extent, but I deadlock myself out of using my leisure time effectively often because I spend so much time deliberating on what I should do.\n3. I tend very rarely to repeat watches, reads, or plays of games, so in the same FOMO spirit I tend to intentionally not watch movies without friends or family so I can enjoy them with people that have never seen them before. (Not so much an issue for books and games other than co-op games).\n4. Inevitably, as new things come out to enjoy, they dilute my leisure pool over time and, to some extent, cause me to watch things I otherwise wouldn’t because I don’t want to “spoil” myself with too rich of content then be bored with life yearning for good content.\n\nI imagine this must sound kind of silly, but does anyone have any good advice on dealing with this?",

        "text": "Thinking about this lately, since the elections in my country which have brought some people with disturbing ideas to power. I fear for the future of this country, and I would like to do something to make a change. The best kind of change would be one which will bring to a political shift towards ensuring a better future and working together instead of the shortsightedness and schism which are so typical for this country and may lead to its' doom.  \nI am just one man now, without millions availble to spend. I know about the political system in my country (Israel) but I never delved deep into the subject.  \nDo you know examples of people who did similar things? what should someone strive to know, study or be in order to make a change like that?   \nthanks!",

        "text": "For starters, I stg I’m the laziest person alive. I honestly don’t want to do anything but chill. I only really have one goal and that is to retire so I don’t have to do things that I don’t feel like doing. Feels like I have no choice but to do a lot of things I don’t really want to do, at least until I retire. I never ask anyone for anything. No favors, no assistance, no money, no nothing. I handle all my own stuff. I don’t like to burden people with my own problems and ask them to do things to help me solve my own problems. But everyone is still always asking me for things. I don’t mind loaning a friend money when they ask if I know they will pay it back, but I really hate it when people ask me to do some kind of work where I have to actually do something. Like I’m sorry but you pay people to do those things, at least that’s what I do. I really enjoy my friends that just hangout and have fun with me and don’t ask me for crap all the time. Left and right though people are asking me to help them move… no thanks, I won’t even move my own stuff so why the hell should I move yours? Did I ask you to help me move? I would never. Like I’m doing all my stuff why do I also have to help people with their stuff. I know I’m a giant a-hole and a lot of people think I’m a jerk. But really when does it ever stop with people asking me for things? The part where this gets bad is when my family asks me for things. I know I’m supposed to just help family when they ask and I’m a jerk for not doing that. But can’t they do their own stuff like I do? I chose specifically not to have kids because that’s way too much work. But I’m still expected to just help everyone all the time because I was born into a family. I get it I’m supposed to help my mom with a bunch of crap, but she has way more money than me why can’t she just pay like I do? I’m sure they would probably help me if I asked, but I really don’t like owing people because then they just ask for more stuff. Also I’m too lazy to do it myself. I get it, I’m a horrible person for not helping people that want my help, but damn can’t I just enjoy people’s company without having a bunch of requests tied to it. I want to mention that if something serious happens, I’m willing to help. Like if my buddy or family is stranded or has a flat tire and no money I will help them. Or if there’s a serious safety issue or medical issue. But you know if I get a flat I take care of it myself or I call roadside assistance. And you know I help my grandpa move stuff when he needs it because he can’t afford to pay and can’t do it himself. Don’t even get me started on depressed people. I am barely keeping my own shit together. I am far away from having skills to help a depressed person. I do want them to feel better and I try but damn that’s a lot of pressure. Like after working 8 hours the last thing I want to do is help someone else be happy, like damn I’m not even that happy. I need at least 6 hours to decompress before I feel like doing anything after work. It’s getting to the point where I don’t even want to see some people because they will just ask me for something. I have 2 dogs. I love animals because they just want to be around me and they aren’t going ask me for anything. They are way better than most people. I’m happy to feed and take care of them because I know they can’t do it themselves and I enjoy having them around. I know there is really something wrong with me, a normal person does not act like this. I do feel bad when I don’t help someone, but I guess I prefer that to helping since I keep doing it. I must be broken inside. I do have hella anxiety idk if it’s related to me being such a jerk. Anyone know what the hell is wrong with me? Why am I like this and how do I stop? I think I might have some kind of condition. Here I am not helping anyone with anything and have the audacity to ask you all for help. Hypocrite. Guess I’m ashamed to get real help. I saw a therapist once and it was nice to vent, but I’m pretty sure they just thought I was a huge jerk.",

This type of trend of criticising against current trends that current generations developing and appreciating the cultural impact and significance of older trends (especially if they had a personal impact on you) is called [\"juvenoia\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc) and these kinds of criticisms have existed throughout time, from [criticisms against the Waltz in early 18th Century, to even criticism against chess and its sedentary activity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/07/18/kids-these-days-have-been-criticized-all-through-history/?utm_term=.3b6c7df02136)\n\nSo which is it? Is it really true that mainstream music is really that horrible or are we picking and choosing certain music trends, whether they are actually poor in quality or not (depends on the artistic taste of the individual like for example the [llama song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKBnAV1bpRE) is not meant to be an official song but a parody song using the style of \"My Humps\" by The Black Eyed Peas and yet has an artistic style of its own) and exaggarating it as if we are currently experiencing a diminishing trend of artistic expression and prowess and mental stimulation and replacing it with lazy writing and simple and easy to flow artistic choices for more profit?",
