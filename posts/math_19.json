Honestly I’m feeling burnt out and I’m kinda sick of math these days. I’m thinking of withdrawing from two math courses and just sticking with my non-math courses.  My gpa cumulative is 3.4.\n(3.2 math, 3.6 non-math)\n\nWould this reflect poorly on me to admissions? Is it common to have a lower gpa studying math?",

From my understanding, the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem states that every continuous map from a convex topological space X to its boundary will admit a fixed point f(a) = a.\n\nOf course, both statements are related to a space and its boundary, and I know the stokes theorem can be used to give a proof of Brouwer’s fixed point. However, I was wondering, is there some deeper relationship between the two? Do they together implicate something?",

        "text": "Alex Kontorovich is a Professor of Mathematics at Rutgers University and served as the Distinguished Professor for the Public Dissemination of Mathematics at the National Museum of Mathematics in 2020–2021. Alex has received numerous awards for his illustrious mathematical career, including the Levi L. Conant Prize in 2013 for mathematical exposition, a Simons Foundation Fellowship, an NSF career award, and being elected Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2017. He currently serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of Quanta Magazine and as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Experimental Mathematics.\n\nIn this episode, Alex takes us from the ancient beginnings to the present day on the subject of circle packings. We start with the Problem of Apollonius on finding tangent circles using straight-edge and compass and continue forward in basic Euclidean geometry up until the time of Leibniz whereupon we encounter the first complete notion of a circle packing. From here, the plot thickens with observations on surprising number theoretic coincidences, which only received full appreciation through the craftsmanship of chemistry Nobel laureate Frederick Soddy. We continue on with more advanced mathematics arising from the confluence of geometry, group theory, and number theory, including fractals and their dimension, hyperbolic dynamics, Coxeter groups, and the local to global principle of advanced number theory. We conclude with a brief discussion on extensions to sphere packings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvpr838ordia1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9ec31b335b832ed3886197fd3d7dffdb0f2b2762\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ggi63yprdia1.png?width=3456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9bd788574c0fd37959d6088103742ecd06ab8d2e\n\nYoutube: [https://youtu.be/i4IC10BLBho](https://youtu.be/i4IC10BLBho)  \nApple Podcasts: [https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cartesian-cafe/id1637353704](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cartesian-cafe/id1637353704)  \nSpotify: [https://open.spotify.com/show/1X5asAByNhNr996ZsGGICG](https://open.spotify.com/show/1X5asAByNhNr996ZsGGICG)  \nRSS: [https://feed.podbean.com/cartesiancafe/feed.xml](https://feed.podbean.com/cartesiancafe/feed.xml)",

        "text": "I've always felt weird about this, like I get the idea. The way I think about it 0.9 recurring equals 1 because there is literally no number that can be added to it without reaching 1. You'd have to add like 0.0 periodic 1 to it to make it reach 1 and you obviously can't put a number after a periodic. \n\n1 and 0.9 recurring are also interchangable in a math equation. But isn't this notion just a simplification caused by the fact that humans can't perceive the idea of infinity and thus can't ?\n\nBecause we can basically rewrite 0.9 recurring as  Σ 9/(10 **\\^** n) where n=1 to infinite. But in that case, 1 is the limit of that summation, not it's result. If we made a curve of that summation, it could never touch 1. We only say it's equal to 1 when using  Σ because that symbol literally means \"sum up\".\n\nso I'd argue 0.9 recurring isnt equal to 1, it's just infinitely close to it.",

        "text": "Hello! \n\nThe carrer+education thread is bugged/not being maintained, so that's why I'm posting here. I will give 1) synopsis of my problem, 2) specific example of my problem, and 3) TLDR. I hope someone can see and understand my problem, because I lack the skill to qualify it, and I hope, equally, that someone can point me on the right track. \n\n1) after American highschool, I'm studying math in a public french  university. It's my second year, and I'm suspecting my American education is missing a core element from my french peers. What is it? \n\n2) we've done the basics last semester (complex numbers, derivatives and integrals, limits, matrices, etc all the boring stuff) , and I am specifically struggling with what I would translate as mathematical reasoning but I can't find an official name in English (does someone know?). I will provide an exemplary question from some homework and it's answer; hopefully you will see the reasoning required and direct me to a source where I could learn the thought proces.\n\nQ:   Let f be a continuous function such f: R -&gt; Z. Prove f is constant. \n\nA (the numbering may be off: I am so lost I don't really know how to organisé my notes. Also I have no idea what \"or\" means in french maths) \n   I) for all a part of R, for all з greater than 0, there exists m &gt; 0, ( |x - a| &lt; m implies |f(x) - f(a)| &lt; з )\n   II) Or🇫🇷 with f(x) part of Z, then f(x) = f(a) +/- n for n part of N. \n   III) If f continuous, then for all з &gt; 0, |f(a) + n - f(a)| &lt; з implies |n| &lt; з. \n   IV) So for 0 &lt; з &lt; 1 , then n must be 0. Also, f(x) = f(a) +/- 0 implies f(x) = f(a). \n   V) or🇫🇷 a is fixed, so f is constant on R\n\nI knew immediately upon reading the Q. After the session, I could follow the teachers logic. But I can not for the life of me build an answer like his on my own. If the divines inspire my two neurons with a bit of voltage, I will maybe put down the definition of a constant line I) because I know that f is either constant or not; and , by boolean logic, I can eventually imply f is continuous or not by manipulating the definition (by implication, by absurd, or by contrapossée). But, for example, in II) how do I come up with f(x) = f(a) +/- n є Z ? In IV) why would I limit з to [0, 1] if I know the definition must be true for ALL epsilon. And how the hell does V) answer the Q?\n\nTLDR my peers are a lot smarter than me, much more than usual, making me believe I either missed something crucial or I should be institutionalized. every effort to study and practice is less than productive. After every tutoring session, I leave angry , confused, and worried. My peers have more or less given up on me. My teachers are doing a good job, but I am still missing something. I need good advice. I'll wake up tomorrow and try to reformat a better, more conscience post, but I'm tired, it's late , I've got exams in a few days, and it's rough.",
