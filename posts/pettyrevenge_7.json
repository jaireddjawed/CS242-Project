        "text": "Hi reddit. This is my first post here and English is not my first language - sorry if I made any big mistakes \n\n I (25m) have been working at a hostel for the last two years. The hostel is a cheap place to stay in the city and work has been chill. I am also a student so I take mostly the night shifts. This also allows me to bring my dog \"Beans\" with me. He's a 3yr old rescue and mostly sleeps under my desk or in my lap. Unfortunately he hasn't had the best life and so I try to make it up to him by spoiling him. He's been getting more comfortable around people and now mostly ignores them.   \nThen recently I got promoted and hired a new receptionist \"Tess\". She (19f) had just finished school and made an ok impression. We quickly bonded over our love for our dogs and she was fine with my dog being at work. After my training she took over some shifts on her own and everything seemed fine. But after a while I was getting complaints about Tess being late or not showing up at work at all.  When my boss confronted her she made up some excuse but didn't change her behavior. So when I caught her getting high at work I told my boss about it. Maybe i shouldn't have but at this point I was pretty exhausted. If she showed up then she wasn't being helpful at all and I was tired of fixing her mistakes. However she still kept her job after she took her dad with her to the meeting and swore that it would not happen again.  \nThen yesterday happened. Tess was supposed to take over after my shift ended but she did not show up and when I texted her she ignored me. Instead my boss called me and told me that Tess had been hospitalized. She had been bitten by my dog and the wound was infected. My boss also told me that Tess was thinking about suing me. I honestly started to cry right then and there. My dog means the world to me. We had some biting troubles in the past but he had been good for months and i felt like it was safe to bring him with me. I always keep an eye on him and never leave him alone with the guests. If Tess got the police involved it would result in Beans getting put down.   \nFortunately this story doesn't end here. Because Tess made one mistake. And it was a pretty dumb one. She sent me a picture of the \"bite\". After a quick google search I found that exact picture. What a dumb bitch. She didn't even use a picture that fit her description. I sent my boss a screenshot and that was that. I can't believe she thought that would actually work. My colleagues told me that she got fired today. Right now she is blowing up my phone and threatening me but I'm no longer worried.",

        "text": "A couple of years ago, a legal client of mine wanted to apply for permits in town X. Without getting too into the details, he was going to need either a rezone or variance. Some folks on the Town‚Äôs board probably didn‚Äôt want the use, as part of their overall vision, but we wanted to apply.\n\nSo I wrote the planning department asking for a pre-application meeting. Three times. First response was that it didn‚Äôt fit with zoning, next two messages went unanswered. In fact, when I resent the third message, I was notified that my email was _blocked_, which is something you‚Äôd never expect from a municipality re a valid request for meeting.\n\nWe applied cold, and it was denied with insufficient explanation. Before I could get an appeal going, or start the variance application process, client gave up. Figured the town was too hostile. \n\nHad to refund him unused retainer amounts, which goes against the First Rule of Acquisition, but was required by my retainer! üòî \n\nFast forward 2 1/2 years. \n\nSame guy applies for a position in my town. I‚Äôm on the board reviewing his application. He presents smoothly, but glosses over a few spots on his resume that show unreliability. \n\nSo I decide to toss his a few questions about how he interacts with pre-applicants. Does he meet with them, cooperate etc. He says the ‚ÄúI love meeting with property owners and will always explain rules and procedures‚Äù type of canned answer. So I press about zoning board of appeals and correspondence styles, as hypotheticals.\n\nHe had never met me face to face.\n\nBut as the hypothetical got detailed, there was a moment when it set it. I could see the smile falter. But now he‚Äôs just lied to a board.\n\nWe discussed the interview thoroughly and candidly afterwards.\n\nA more sincere applicant succeeded to the job. She was arguably better qualified too. üëçüèΩ",

        "text": "This was a long time ago, back in the days of pay phones, land lines and collect calls. I worked for a telephone political survey company. They would generate phone number lists using the area code and exchange number (1st 3 numbers) then random last 4 numbers. We would call and try to get the people to do the survey. This was before the advent of widespread caller ID and answering machines, late 1970s s most people answered their phones. I'd say 80% people just hung up, 15% people yelled, and demanded to know how I got their number, and I would explain it was randomly generated and about 5% would at least start answering the questions. One day I got a man who was really verbally abusive and threatening, was going to find me and kill me, etc. I let him rant for 10 minutes or so before I hung up, I got paid by the hour, so I didn't care. But I did write his number down and put it in my wallet. I was in my late teens, drinking age was 18 at the time and I tended to stay out to last call, especially on the weekends. So, when the bars closed, I would go to a nearby pay phone, pull out the number and place a collect call at 2 or 3 AM to this guy. I would always get a good laugh when he would start ranting at the operator. I did this on and off for over 6 months until I lost the number. Until I finally got caller ID and could avoid numbers I didn't know, I was never mean to cold callers.",

Just your typical desperate college student trying to land any part-time job. \n\nGot an email through my school offering a trial period as a crypto assistant that pays 450 weekly if I passed. Linked me to a google form and asked for basic infos, I didn't put anything too personal except my phone number and a spare email. I even gave a false name. Days after that, I got a text saying they \"virtually screened\" me and asked if I was ready yada yada.\n\nDespite warnings from my close ones, I was too desperate and just went along as I was very ignorant to the different types of scams there now are. I never gave my bank info or anything like that, and they even said they will send me \"funds\" to use for the trial week. So I dropped my guard, thinking there was no risk and accepted the digital check that was sent THROUGH EMAIL. \n\nLong story short, it was a counterfeit check and I made purchases for them during the week and I actually ended up owning the bank money. And right as I deposited the 2nd check, my bank put my account on hold deeming me an unworthy customer. At that point it just clicked, I did some research online and realized \"ahh fuck, my dumb ass just got scammed\". I reported it to FTC Report Fraud, hoping it'll help future victims if at all. Then me being petty, I didn't want to just block them and let them walk away that easily. So I ended up leading the guy in a loop for a couple of days, wasting their time and even throwing in a couple jabs on valentines day.\n\nHere are some of our exchanges after I realized I got scammed : [https://imgur.com/a/x7Cun70](https://imgur.com/a/x7Cun70) \n\nDefinitely a life lesson for me to be extremely cautious from here on out.

Each bench sat about 5 people.\n\nThere wasn't assigned seating and I had different people sitting by me each class. \n\nAt the beginning of one class, the professor decided to give us a pop quiz. The bench I sat at was full and I sat on the 2nd seat from the end of the bench. There was a guy that sat at the end of the bench. Questions were on the black board and we were asked to pull out a blank sheet of paper from our notebooks and use that. I think I got 2 answers wrong.\n\nOnce done, we had to pass our quiz to the right, which each person would just continue to pass it until it reaches the end of the bench. The TA would come by and collect the quizzes from each bench.\n\n The guy at the end of the bench looked at everyone's answers and changed or wrote down the answers he knew were correct from all of our quizzes. The TA came by collected the piles of quizzes. Guy left shortly after. \n\nI didn't like the fact he cheated off my quiz or the others. I don't even know the guy or his name, but the paper he used was not the normal white notebook paper. His had a yellow tint to it and was smaller in size. \n\nAfter class I went to the professor who had the pile of completed quizzes sitting on his desk. I explained what had happened. The professor asked me if I knew his name. I said no, but I knew his paper was yellow. The professor looked through the pile and found the only yellow paper and crumpled it up and threw it in the trash bin. 0 on that quiz buddy. \n\nThe quiz wasn't worth much in points, but I didn't want the guy getting credit for cheating.\n\nTL;DR: Guy I didn't know cheated off my quiz and I got his quiz thrown out.",

Some time later we got divorced...life went on. 6 years later I met what would then become my 2nd wife who I love dearly, I'm happily married and all things are good.\n\nAs for my ex wife who will call ExWife I had no kids with her, no property, no nothing. Our divorce was uncontested although I did give her a lump sum of money to start her life out with...that was it. \n\nWell it was about a decade after the divorce all of a sudden I get an email from ExWife. I open it up, I'll share you the detials but it was a sob story with a request for me to give her $5,000. I didn't feel like it even required a response...and I sent no response and just went on about my life. \n\nNow my job at the time resulted in my phone number being pretty widely published and if you knew my real name you could easily find my real phone number simply by googling my name. So I'm guessing that's how my ExWife got my number...but she called me when I was at work. This is the basic gist of the conversation:\n\nMe; Hello?\n\nExWife: Is this Bambi?\n\nMe: Yes, who is this?\n\nExWife: Your ExWife\n\nMe: O, why are you calling?\n\nExWife: Did you get my email?\n\nMe: Yes\n\nExWife: Why didn't you respond?\n\nMe: Cause its not my problem\n\nExWife: I really need that $5,000\n\nMe: Yea...that's not going happen\n\nExWife: But I'm your ex-wife\n\nMe: Yes...Ex...Wife...again not my problem\n\nExWife: Look I didn't wanna go down this road\n\nMe: Then don't\n\nExWife: Do you remember that sex tape we made?\n\nMe: (thinking, I had honestly forgot about it, I don't have a copy, then I remembered) Yea I remember it\n\nExWife: If you don't send me $5,000 I'm going release the sex tape and send it to all your co-workers, friends, etc\n\nMe: So your trying to blackmail me?\n\nExWife: No I just need that $5,000\n\nMe: Again that's not my problem\n\nExWife: It will be if I release that video\n\nMe: Ok fine release it\n\nExWife: Excuse me?\n\nMe: You do know I was the ugly one in that sex tape right?\n\nExWife: Uh?\n\nMe: Your telling me if I don't give you $5,000 your going release a video of me having sex with some young attractive woman? If I remember correctly you where moaning like crazy...so...um yea if you wanna add to my resume go ahead\n\nExWife: I'm serious\n\nMe: Me too\n\nExWife: Fuck you asshole! **hangs up**\n\nI went home, told my wife. She said if she releases the video she releases the video it is what it is. \n\nPersonally I don't think she even has the video cause it was recorded on her phone and my ex had a bad habit of throwing her phone against walls and breaking them. But never the less I felt like taking the steam out of her threat was the best way to end it...and if she ever did release the video...eh so what.\n\nIts been a few months, haven't heard from her, nor have any of my friends, family or co-workers heard of any sex tape.",

I was his biggest supporter at the time.  I just wanted him to be happy.  He married her after being with her for only 4 months together.  I was just happy he was happy.\n\nHe used to call me and accuse me of siding with my mom, even after he remarried.   We came to a head when I got engaged and invited him to my wedding.  He said if my mom was going to be there, he wouldn't attend.  I told him that I wanted both parents to be in attendance and he basically called me a traitor and to go fuck myself.  After that, he sent me long winded text messages about how my mom cuckholded him, sharing intimate details about their sex lives and when I told him to stop, he ghosted me for 10 years\n\nHe's always been abusive, both physically and emotionally, but at his wedding to my stepmother, he tried to kiss me romantically ,and said if the world ended, he'd take me and repopulate the human species to create a biologically perfect species. \n\nI immediately cut off contact after that, and I didn't hear from him again.\n\nOut of the blue, he called me yesterday.   I don‚Äôt even know how he got my number, but he was obviously drunk and told me I destroyed his happiness on his wedding day, and his wife has never forgiven him for what I did to him.\n\nShe's apparently leaving him now, and it's all my fault. \n\nHe called me a tease and said I blew the content of our conversation out of context.\n\nThen he yelled at me and said if he was serious about us repopulating the human species, he would have just taken it from me.  Called me a bunch of names and hung up on me.\n\nI've been trying to tow the line with him for decades.  I've stood by him after everything he's done to me and when I finally told him to stop, he threatened my life.\n\nSo, I called ICE on him.  He's never gotten his US citizenship, even after getting married to my stepmother.\n\nNow he's getting his ass deported back to Canada.   His wife has a criminal record, so she won't be able to join him.  \n\nI've destroyed his life and I don't feel bad about it",

        "text": "So I'm not sure how \"petty\" this revenge is. It definitely doesn't fall under pro or nuclear revenge, so I'm posting here. I'm still fairly new to reddit, so obviously if I've posted in the wrong place feel free to take it down and/or tell me where I should post it instead.   \n\n\ntl;dr: Coworker makes a racial comment about my girlfriend, I blast him full on in the face with a bunch of crumbs and seeds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA long long time ago, back in my high school years, I worked at a small retail food place. Obviously won't name the place, but suffice to say we sold bagels. I actually loved working there and could probably write a baker's dozen of stories about the random going-ons there. I swear if we put up some high def cameras in the place, we could have made a sitcom out of the people I worked with. And this was prior to the Office. I've had several jobs since then, and nothing quite topped that experience.   \n\n\nBut that's for another time. Today's episode involves a potentially racist co-worker making one too many comments I took fault with.   \n\n\nFirst, to clarify why I say \"potentially racist.\" This was ages ago, and most of us were immature teens or young adults working part time as a first job during high school. It was a predominately white neighborhood, but naturally we had several people of various races work there over time (\"Black Phil\" will always be an eternal legend to anyone who knew him.) Being immature high school-young 20s kids, we all had a fairly shared mentality: Offensive jokes were FUNNY! At least: They were funny so long as you were willing to laugh at jokes at your own expense, and not just jokes at someone else's expense.   \n\n\nSo there was a ton of ribbing offensive comments between co-workers, ranging from slightly over-the-top mom jokes, to flat out offensive stereotype comments, to downright blasphemous comments regarding religion made to our 'a bit more pious than us' manager.   \n\n\nThis one guy, we'll call Bill (actually the younger brother of the manager), however often took things a tad too far. How do you take things too far in a place where everyone is trying to one up each other with offensive comedy? Well pretty much every other worker there gave off the same strong vibe of \"I'm just making a joke, I don't actually think that,\" when making any manner of racial comment. This guy... it just always seemed like he was a bit more serious in his comments than the rest of us. Could never quite be sure, but it often seemed like he wasn't \"making a joke\", like maybe he was just actually a bit racist.   \n\n\nAt the time I was dating a black girl. This didn't seem like at all an issue to us, but the very short white dude and the very tall black girl dating... was apparently a hot topic in our community. It's not like the neighborhood was super against it or racist or anything, it's just that our relationship was apparently very 'visible'. People we barely knew apparently knew about us and that we were dating. To a lot of people, the fact that I was dating \"this tall black girl\" became my most prominent feature (which looking back, was almost refreshing after spending years as \"the short weird kid\".)   \n\n\nAnd naturally everyone at work knew about it, and in a place rife with offensive humor it naturally got brought up. Just usually more lighthearted than our other comments (people trying to make offensive jokes, ironically not 'actually offend someone'.)   \nOh but Bill always took things a step too far. At one point he made a generally disparaging remark against black women (implying all black women were de-facto unattractive) right next to me... while I was holding a broom. So I bonked him (rather lightly, but enough to feel it) on the head with the broom and gave him a generic \"Shut your damn mouth\" comment.   \nEveryone else around laughed, told him he deserved it. Life went on.   \n\n\nBut finally one day he said something... way too far regarding my girlfriend. He was probably just trying to make a joke, but it was rough enough that I won't dare repeat it here (post would definitely get taken down), and I thought, \"Yeah, he has to pay for that.\"   \n\n\nBagel store. Big ole baskets on the bagel wall, and bagels make plenty of crumbs. Especially seeded ones like Poppy, Everything, Sesame, Onion, etc. We had a broom and dustpan, and a small shop vac for cleaning up all the leftover seeds and crumbs at the end of the day.   \n\n\nSo I took the mini shop vac, took the hose out of the intake side and put it in the exhaust side, and used the broom and dustpan to pour some of the seeds and crumbs and crap into the hose. Plugged it in, then innocently called out \"Hey, Bill\" to get his attention.   \n\n\nHe looked over, I turned on the vac, and the exhaust port basically shotgunned all the seeds and crumbs straight into his face and open eyes.   \n\n\nHe starts writhing. Other co-workers (including his older brother) start laughing. Mid writhe I just shout something at him like \"I told you not to say that s\\*\\*\\* anymore!\" and walk off.   \nOnce again, everyone gives him a basic \"Yeah, you had that coming\" speech, he washes his eyes out, and we just go back to closing up the shop.   \n\n\nPost-credit: Years later his behavior seemed to settle into \"Okay, he's not ACTUALLY racist... at least he's not NOW. He just came across way more serious with his 'offensive jokes' than the rest of us when we were younger.\"",

My friend started talking to a girl on the internet that lived down in florida (we're in michigan).\n\nHe convinced us to go down to Florida for spring break so that he could meet this girl he was falling for. We end up going down there and it's awful. We're in a shit part of florida (lol aren't they all?) and it's nothing but old people, and the beach is a 30 minute drive away (from what I remember). He ditched me and our other friend any chance he got to hang out with this girl.\n\nHer spring break was the week prior so she had to go to school while we were there, which meant she had a pretty strict curfew. One night me and the other guy are sitting around the hotel room waiting for our friend to come back from hanging out with his girl. When he got back we suggested heading to Denny's for some food, and he started getting ready to go back to see his girlfriend again. We asked him what he was doing, what about her curfew? He says he's going to sneak in her bedroom window. We tell him good luck.\n\nAbout a half hour later I call the police and tell them I just saw a guy breaking into a house. described what he was wearing and gave their address. About another 20 minutes later his girlfriend calls crying her eyes out. The cops escorted him back to the hotel where he immediately got on the phone so that they could cry to each other about the situation. \n\nHe didn't know I called until about 10 years later. They had since gotten married and divorced. We never mentioned it again.",

Mom asked her to move her leg but she ignored her, and put her bag/jacket basically ON my back.\nI brushed it off but my mom didn't, so she asked her to move because that was our spot. The woman could say it nicely, but no, she decided to almost hit my mother when she said the performer was her boyfriend and that she'll move when it's over, but rudely. So my mom got up and we  got on our phones for the meantime.\nAfter the warm up ended, she gripped both my mom's shoulders and said something like \"you can continue being on your phone\". She was most probably angry because we didn't watch, though we couldn't because she was standing on the stair we chose to stand on to see the stage from behind the crowd.\nHer boyfriend was the son of the frontman of the band that performed, and, thinking she probably reads her boyfriend's texts, I sent a pretty long message to his dad, saying she's a psychotic double-faced witch and that in his place I would try separating them before it's too late.\nI don't know if it will actually do something, and sadly I wouldn't be able to tell you the outcome, but I'm still satisfied I did it.",

It's my Ex's birthday today, and I had always made a very nice V-Day/Birthday week extravaganza each year of our 10 year marriage despite his dirtbag ways. Horrible marriage, lots of DV, and when I finally could take our kids and I leave I left almost everything behind, including the house. Had to, or I would have never been free. \n\nWell, a few weeks ago when one of my sons visited him they noticed that my Ex had received mail with my name on it. It was his electric bill. Long story short, he was supposed to have updated accounts into his name but did not because that would have cost him money, and I somehow failed to notice. My bad for not knowing, but single motherhood, starting over, and recovering was almost too much at times and I guess things slipped through the cracks. I since have run my credit report and straightened a few other things out...nothing too horrible. As far as the electric company went, they told me I had two options. I could notify him and schedule a termination, which would allow him time to come to the office with a deposit and paperwork to start the account over in his name. Or I could simply terminate the account, and then suggested this I might want to do so this week as it was the best time in the billing cycle to do so. I thought hard about it. He lives alone and doesn't have any pets or people in the house who would be harmed by a night without power. It's a major inconvenience though, he'll be confused when the lights go out, and then when he's told the news he'll be mad, and then he'll have to come up with a deposit tomorrow. \n\nSo she helped me schedule it for COB today. Operation LIGHTS OUT ASSHOLE should be happening right now!\n\nI truly hope he has a lousy birthday today. And a cold shower in the morning. And if there's any deposit returned to me, the electric company says it's mine to keep, but I'll be donating to the women's crisis center a few towns away where I live now, happily ever after and with lovely electricity powering this little note of petty revenge. Thanks for sharing it with me!",

        "text": "To reduce recognizability i'll avoid details as much as possible. tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nI work as 3rd level support for a company that develops and provides software for a business area, that's quite heavily regulated, a lot of our development efforts go to just keeping up with new and changing laws. Also the software, while being mainly used for one purpose, usually in one way or the other gets used throughout the whole company using it, so with bigger companies, they sometimes have multiple departments, each only supporting parts of the software in-house, basically each department of the company having their own in-house tech-support for our software.\n\nSo with this one customer. They have one main-support-team (containing, but not led by the CTO of the company) for our software and each department has their own sub-team who answer to the head of the main-team. As always, new years had brought new laws and regulations. Especially in one department, an up to now optional feature became mandatory by law starting 01.01.23. Mind you, the information about the new law was public in February 22 and our software supports this feature since the middle of 21. So enough time to configure, test and move to production with it, right? Unfortunately, as it's an extremely technical topic, i'm currently the only person in our company's support-team with in-depth knowledge. We're working on changing that, but not everyone who works in support has a background deeply rooted in software development, so it takes time.\n\nWell, starting January this one sub-department, basically a one man show, as it's a rather small department at the customer started sending support tickets \"this isn't working with the new feature\", \"that isn't working with the new feature\" and so on, 7 Tickets total, all highest priority, because \"it's an error message and we're legally required to use it\". Each and every one of the tickets I answered them the exact passage of the manual where they could read up that exact error message, explaining how it's a missing configuration on their end and exactly (with screenshots!) what to configure. These configurations are not part of any kind of support plan we offer, so work on these tickets is a \"pay by hour\" thing for the company. Never got any reply to them so considered them done with that.\n\nWell, i guessed wrong. I got another highest priority support-ticket today stating it's not working. Obviously i asked, if the configurations i sent over in the other tickets have been done, to which i get the reply, how should they know, they're just back from a multi-week vacation. I politely replied, that he should check those configurations and to not cost them unnecessary money, i would hold off working on that ticket until he checked them.\n\nThe reply i received to that basically stated, that he found it very audacious that there are now 8 open highest priority requests about that topic and the company i worked at haven't moved a finger in the month since they were submitted and that he demands i hand over those tickets to someone else in our support-team, who actually wants to do our job or he will escalate the issue to the main team.\n\nNow, you should know that this customer is one of our biggest clients, so their requests inherently get slightly higher priority on our side and also we know that they generally (with a few black sheep obviously) have a very good in-house team, so the team is pretty liberal at rooting their technical requests through to me. Because of that i get to work a lot with their main-team who handles those technical issues and the bigger the installation, the more troublesome. They enjoy working with me so much, that for the past half year or so we've been on a first name basis when communicating (including the CTO). An information, that obviously hadn't reached this poor soul yet.\n\nSo, to spare him the work of escalating the issue, according to process i wrote a formal escalation mail (using first names, petty, i know) to the lead of their main team, as well as my team-lead cc-ing the guy from the sub-team, informing them about all the highest priority tickets, including detailed information since when the feature is available, when the information about it becoming mandatory by law was publizised and when it became mandatory, compiling the answers from all the tickets into one and also sending an official, detailed by ticket, offer with which they could purchase service from us to do those configurations for them. I also included a letter from our legal team that every customer had received about half a year ago, that we are not liable for any damages they incur by not testing the feature before the legal date.\n\nAbout an hour later i got a formal answer from one of their main-team that the configurations i sent have been implemented and every issue has been resolved, the feature works as intended, thanking me for bringing to their attention that they were behind on that topic, followed half a minute later by an informal mail informing me that i don't need to worry, the next person to submit tickets on behalf of that one-person department should be much more professional.\n\nAnd the moral of the story: Don't try to threaten with authority you don't have.\n\ntl;dr: Customer-Employee threatened to report me not doing his job while he went on vacation, got fired for it.",

I have zero tolerance for cheating in a relationship. Anyway I appreciate that he told me. But later on, I found out that all of his friends and family, who I was close with knew he cheated on me and never told me. That just pushed the knife deeper through my heart. \n\nSo, a few months passed since the breakup and he reaches out.  He wanted to express how sorry he was, how much he ‚Äúloved‚Äù me, and how much he regrets everything that happened. I had also found out that he had a girlfriend, who lived down the street from my townhouse. That‚Äôs when I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to rip his heart out and step on it, just like he did to me. \n\nSince, we started back talking, I made him break up with his current girlfriend and show me proof. The poor girl was heart broken. From that point forward, we started dating again. I used him for his money and to get my rocks off. On our last date, I kissed him then broke up with him. He was on the verge of tears and I didn‚Äôt give a damn.",

        "text": "Hey all, this is a more in-depth version of my previous post [\"Don't pay rent? no internet access during movie night\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/112kpei/wont_pay_rent_ill_cut_off_your_internet_access/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). I thought you guys didn't want to read a book. But here it is, in all of it's glory\n\nThere is a lot to cover here so I'll break her behavior into different brackets so it's easier to digest. Besides that here's how it all started:\n\nThis story started back in January of 2022. I was dating a friend and we were looking at apartments to live together. We found one but he brought up an import issue. Since my job takes me out of state across America for a month at a time, he wanted to let his childhood friend move in with us. It was a 2 bedroom apartment after all so I agreed. I thought since he knew her, she would've been A-OK to live with us. I mean, I won't be there most of the time and I trusted him. I even knew her personally and she had a good job and was overall a sane person. That all changed when she moved in with us. \n\nBehavioural:\nShe would act like a mother, basically scolding us if the dishes weren't done (which was a cycled responsibility and it was always her turn to do them when she whined). She wouldn't respect house rules, like not wearing shoes on the carpet or asking us before inviting strangers over. She would act like she knew everything and if I brought up a topic of something I was interested in she seemed to brush it off with \"Okay\". Verbally abuse my Ex when he would little fuck-ups like spill garbage or play videogames after a long workday. She would belittle him and make him feel like a fat pig (which he had sensitivities about). She would attack me personally when I set rules, an example being is that I wanted my own food in the common area fridge and she threw a fit at me. Saying \"you make all the money but you won't share food? I don't think that's a good idea to split food like that. We need it!\"\n\nResponsibilities:\nNever would clean, do dishes, etc. Quit her $21/hr job because \"it was too hard\" and started working at the mall. This was her putting in little effort instead of paying rent and when I'd ask her for this months rent she would blame the economy or her made up disability which was not medically verified. Any other thing you could possibly think of she wouldn't do it and she would make my ex do it \n\nReally important:\nShe would invite random people over that we didn't know and this ended up in a SA case with my Ex. Someone came over and abused him and it was the problem roommates fault. Some stuff ended up missing and she continued to invite random people over without permission even after what happened to my Ex.\n\nAfter that happened I was done dealing with a child. She sucked the life out of me and made me scared for my Ex's life and mine. So I enacted a revenge plot.\n\nI tried evicting her but she refused to sign the release form. I talked to many different lawyers and they said they couldn't do anything and the Civil judge would laugh at me and make me pay a fine. So I said screw it, I cut off her internet access since she didn't pay for it and that caused her to almost damage my property and overall touch it without permission while screaming at me over the phone and calling me \"dangerous\". That was step one, making her miserable. Step two was relatively simple. In November we got our second strike because this woman kept heavy walking and we would always tell her to walk lighter and she would deflect any responsibility and blame the lady downstairs. So I hatched a plan, I'd go downstairs and talk to the lady making the complaints. I mean, if we got one more complaint we got evicted. \nSo I went downstairs, talked to the lovely lady and told her everything. We decided to make a plan regarding her making a falsified noise complaint and that was that. The next day she made the complaint and within 24 hours we had a eviction notice. To see that paper was bittersweet. I worked so hard to get my first ever apartment and she ruined it but I knew this was my freedom. I knew that after this eviction our awful roommate would never get back into her feet due to her reliance on others. She had to move into her 2001 Jetta that had a bad heater and last I heard from her, she is still in her Jetta. For some reason living with her new boyfriend in the car? I don't understand it but I wouldn't be surprised.",

I asked what they were getting done today, not as a way to be nosey but as to get correct stamp and an idea of what work they needed from me. There‚Äôs a big difference in closing on a house, doing a will, or just a simple DMV correction form. The husband started with ‚Äúit just for my work!‚Äù In a super aggressive angry tone. It took me back by surprise. I try to look at the forms to see if only one or both of them needed a notary on their signature or if witnesses were needed etc‚Ä¶. Seeing as he refused to tell me what I was to put my name on. His forms needed both husband and wife notarized I asked for their ID and again he got super aggressive. I told him I was very sorry but I needed to read through the documents to be sure we do it right. And everyone that I was notarized had to produce valid ID. He started calling me a b and to f this f that. I‚Äôm a stupid c. ‚Ä¶. I closed my notary book and calmly told him to get out of my business location never return and find him self a different notary. I apologized to his wife who was trying to apologize for him profusely. I told her ‚Äú I feel like you have to do this a lot for him‚Äù I parted saying good luck to her. \n\nMoral of the story if you NEED me to do something for you BE NICE! \nOn a side note I know all the other notaries in the area refuse to do their job and send them to my location where we do tons. I bet he had a hard time finding a notary that day lol",

        "text": "This happened about 12 years ago and I've always wanted to post it and figured today is perfect. At the time I had been married to my husband for about 4 years.\nQuick back story: my birthday is in mid December. I had given birth to our second child a few months before my birthday and our 1st was born less than 2 years before that. Both pregnancies were difficult and I had required painful surgery before I could get pregnant both times. I was a SAHM and he traveled a lot for work, usually 20+ days/month. \nI had never been big on birthdays or valentine's day for myself but often went a little overboard for his birthday which was 2/13, the day before v-day. \nSo this particular year we didn't have much money but I was hoping for something heart-felt, maybe a personal and thoughtful card. He was out of town on my birthday and all he did was call to say happy b-day. Ok, that stung a bit but too busy with baby and toddler to care.\nChristmas comes and he's been hinting he got me something big and expensive that he's sure I'll love. Turns out, he got me a microwave. Now yes, we needed one eventually because ours was falling apart but it wasn't a big need. I did my best to smile and thank him but was definitely hurt.\nSo the following February comes around and I'm torn about whether I should even bother getting him something nice. I'm out shopping at Walmart and I spot it...THE PERFECT GIFT for DH. A bright red (most romantic color) toaster!\nI made sure to hint that he was getting the best gift ever since he worked so hard traveling while I just sat comfortably at home eating bonbons and enjoying the company of our sweet perfect children. \nThe look on his face when he opened that damn box was glorious. Unfortunately after that year he never bothered getting me gifts again (deserved, I suppose) and I gave up trying to get him to care. \nIt only took me 8 more years to finally leave him but it had nothing to do with gifts. It was the lying and cheating that eventually convinced me to leave.",

Due to my job making me leave home for long amounts of time I decided to do the only thing I could do. I went into my router admin panel and disabled the internet access to all the registered devices, change the password, and gave the new password to the trustworthy roommate. As soon as they realize what I did they're a temperament went into temper tantrum territory. They were blowing up my phone screaming at me and calling me deceitful and all these other words and throwing stuff around the apartment like a toddler. They relocated all my game consoles and any other item including security cameras I had set up in the living room. So after they did that sort of thing, every other interaction I had with them compounded into this recent interaction and I flat out made it so we all got evicted. Somehow this eviction wasn't put on my record and this happened 7 months ago and they're still living in their car. Sweet sweet revenge. \n\nFor anybody curious they were 21 at the time going on 5 years old. I hope you enjoyed reading this and I apologize for any errors",

        "text": "I have been tempted to write this story for a while but was too afraid. But I figured if I am brave enough to post unpopular opinions in fan subreddits, I can write a personal story. Plus, I'm bored at work, so I need to keep busy.  \n\n\nSo let's go back to pre-COVID days of college. I was in graduate school and started my first semester as a teaching assistant for a theories class. Now the major associated with this class is more art/creative oriented. They are the type of student base that couldn't care less about theories or other academic discourse. So traditionally, our department usually had very engaging instructors to help make the required class more palatable. Or at the very least, the class was easy enough to avoid being a weed out class.   \n\n\nEnter Mr. Aziz. This is not his name, but when thinking of fake names I gravitated to Aziz Ansari. Mr. Aziz could be Russian or Episcopalian, but I digress.   \n\n\nAnyway, the short of it is that Mr. Aziz was a PhD student who had a dislike for our undergrads. I understood that graduate and doctorate students treat undergrads like opportunistic raccoons  (usually for good reason), but Mr. Aziz took it to another level. He was outright antagonistic to a hostility I never seen from a instructor. The first conversation I had with the guy involved him sitting me down.   \n\n\n\"The first thing you should know is to never trust these students. You do not want to be their friends,\" he said.   \n\n\nNow I recognize the sentiment, but the tone was on the level of a character from a zombie apocalypse movie. The level of contempt in his voice was discomforting.   \n\n\nCut to the first day of class. Mr. Aziz had two instructions for me that I had to follow throughout the semester, and both reflect his sentiment towards his students.   \n\n\nFirst, he wanted everyone assigned to seats...in alphabetical order...for a class of over a hundred students. So, on the first day, we had to spend the first thirty minutes naming every person on the roster to get them seated. And then, he expected me to take attendance every class putting the names to the alphabetical order we sat the students in. He gave me no ID pictures and simply expected me to just learn all the names. Now, it didn't occur to us to just map a seating chart. But in my defense, I was TA for less than a week at this point and was relying on the wisdom of Mr. Aziz early on. I also have an anxiety disorder, so my panicked ass wasn't going to think up a quick solution. I still wonder why Mr. Aziz, who has taught for a number of semesters at this point, didn't provide me with that idea since it seems so obvious in retrospect.   \n\n\nThe second thing he wanted me to do was monitor the class in the back to make sure students weren't using their phones and give them a zero on their participation grade if they were. So I had to know which students were not participating without a seating chart or not immediately knowing their name. This showcased his deep lack of trust of his students. He wanted little room for the students to cheat the system, which is hard to do with 120 odd students and a TA with no experience.   \n\n\nSuffice it to say, it was a shit show. My accuracy was horrible and sitting through every class to monitor was terrible. Remember when I said that the theories instructor was usually engaging to make the clinical material more tolerable? Yeah, Mr. Aziz wasn't that. To put it simply, if I had him as a teacher when I was in undergrad, I would have consider him the worst instructor I ever had. He was vague, didn't compel discussion, and generally felt more like an obstacle to the students learning than a guide. He was so bad that when another PhD student subbed for him and actually taught the class, you can feel the atmosphere of the room change. You would never thought a Nigerian man could take a theories lesson and turn in into paradise, but it sure felt like it to the students and I.   \n\n\nSo about a few weeks in, and I threw my hands up and just did the ol' sign up sheet method. This lasted for most of the semester until the last month where Mr. Aziz sent a critical email telling me to revert back to the old method. When I told him my concerns as well mannered as I could, he accused me of being 'hostile' and other inflaming adjectives. I suppose he wanted to seem I was the agitator for email evidence.   \n\n\nHe also threatened my TA evaluation which I did not take well which leads to the main event.   \n\n\nPart of the class was an essay. And in the fine print of the assignment laid one sentence. \"This assignment can be worked with another person.\" The vagueness and lack of limitations could easily cause confusion (even be exploited in the right hands).   \n\n\nWhen I showed him my concern for this part of the assignment, he waved it off and said this wouldn't be a problem. This sort of put me over the edge. I'm not quick to anger, but that was close to what pulling the final straw felt like.  \n\n\nCut to class, and he is explaining the assignment. I know the moment a student asks about the group project line, it would easily cause a ruckus. But no one was saying anything. So, I took matters into my own hands. I got the attention of a student sitting next to me.   \n\n\n\"Hey look to page three,\" I whispered. He turned to the page in question right before I stabbed his paper with my finger. \"Can you ask Mr. Aziz about this line?\"   \n\n\nNaturally, he was confused. I mean why the hell would the TA be asking him to do such an odd thing? But I reassured him and told him to \"humor me.\"   \n\n\nA few minutes later, he raised his hand and asked the question.   \n\n\nWhat followed was the most insane, chaotic, and out of control college class I've seen. It was like a high school auditorium. People were talking over each other and asking questions. Girls were already deciding who to work with. People were just on their phones and couldn't care less. This was an over hour long class, and about fifty minutes of it was dedicated to clearing up the confusion to this one fucking line. \"This assignment can be worked with another person.\"   \n\n\nMr. Aziz looked overwhelmed as he tried to reign control of his class while I stared at him like Griffith from Berserk. It was my most satisfying moment as a TA.   \n\n\nThere is more to this story, but I will stop here since that is where the pettiness ends. As I have matured, I look back and wish I done things differently. I realize now that I made mistakes and learned lessons during that time. I totally understand if this story rubs you the wrong way. I sometimes feel the same way.  \n\n\nThat being said, while I don't remember the names of any of my 120 odd students, I still remember Mr. Aziz's face trying to tame them.",

Sorry you had to walk 30ft to the office like you were supposed to.  \n\nSo, when technicians need access to our buildings, we require their ID badge in case they don't return our keys.  With Xfinity, they tend to have a clear pouch on a lanyard with multiple cards inside such as company ID, building access card, etc...  Well, guess who doesn't have his access card to get back to his Xfinity building tonight?  (Yes, I reported him, but the long string of Xfinity people you have to go through is such a waste of time, and I'm working anyway.)",

        "text": "Not my story, but my mother's. \n\nSome months ago, my grandfather on my father's side passed. After the funeral, his children and their spouses started cleaning/taking things from the house amicably. My parents had gifted an e-tablet to my grandfather the Christmas before his passing, and asked to get it back, which we did. It was still connected to his Messenter account, and through iddle snooping (we mindlessly opened the app and saw some of the messages), we saw there was a group with my grandfather and all of my father's siblings, but not my father. They had been bitching about my parents (my father was always the perfect son and was always neglected by his parents for the benefit of his younger siblings, he was the second oldest), said grossly xenophobic things about my mother while also dunking on her religion (we live on France and she's christian and american, they're atheists), hinted that my younger sister dropped out because she was too busy getting nailed by her boyfriend, and called me an ungrateful twerp (though they were probably right about the last one). \n\nSo... we just kept quiet, because we figured it was my father's choice whether to confront them or not. He chose not to, because my father is mature and wise. My mother, however, not so much. So while my parents were there (my grandfather's house) to clean out one weekend, the others decided to go bowling (they didn't invite my parents, mind you). My mother saw a GOLDEN oppurtunity : she knew we wouldn't be taking anything else from the house. So she went and did NASTY things to all the other things that the other siblings were going to take. Dishes ? Spat on all of them and rubbed it all over. Cleaning supplies ? Pissed in them (don't ask me how she did it, I am just a believer). My favorite being all the household linens : she gave all of those a quick rub-a-dub with her crotch, UNDERNEATH her underwear. With SPECIAL care given to the expensive memory pillows sought after by the one sibling who had the most xenophobic comments to make about her. \n\nI might have my own form of revenge at some point but nothing I can post here as of yet.\n\nFormer aunts and uncles, if there's any chance you're reading this, enjoy the fishy smells !",

        "text": "This is my first ever petty revenge, so hopefully it's petty enough to be here. This story is FRESH off the petty press.\n\nCharacters:\n\n* **#W** (My wife)\n* **#F** (Her friend)\n* **#S** (Scummy hotel)\n* **#N** (Nice hotel)\n\n# Backstory\n\nIn June 2021, **#W** and **#F** took a girl's trip to a certain beach town in the southern part of the USA. They were trying to keep costs low, so they rented a car instead of flying &amp; booked a 4 night stay at **#S** on Booking.com which required our payment method. Once they got there, in order to check in they had to sign multiple documents, provide their license plate, provide their driver's license, as well as pay a $100 damage deposit and provide our credit card info *again* \\-- First red flag. They did all that and went to their room. Upon entering, they did not like the condition of the room. Hair all over the blankets, rust and mold on the fixtures, crayon on all the walls, etc. It was...really bad. The original price of the stay was $378.60, but per the hotel's cancellation policy, we had to pay the first night's stay due to cancelling within 2 days, so our refund amount should've been $283.95. \n\nThey cancelled their stay with Booking.com and went to the front desk to confirm cancellation. The guy at the front desk stated that Booking.com will issue them their refund (So why did you need our credit card?), then shooed them out and locked the door since the \"office is closed\". At this point it's well past 9 PM and **#W** and **#F** are in an unfamiliar town that they just drove 12 hours to get to with no place to sleep. I was able to book them last minute at **#N** at 9:25 PM which they stayed at for the remainder of their stay. It was over \\~$200 more expensive, but worth it. All in all, I've spent $863.85 in hotel accommodations. Just needed my refund for the previous hotel. Now for the revenge part\n\n# The Revenge\n\nEven though the transactions were still pending on my credit card, I went ahead and disputed them anyway. I provided my credit card company the original email and picture I took of the cancellation screen, as well as the cancellation policy that the hotel provides on Booking.com. Around 3 months later I get a notification that the dispute was not resolved in my favor due to having no evidence. That's odd, I know I submitted it. Okay, I'll dispute again. This time after I submitted my evidence, I called them to confirm they received it, which they did. Another three months later they notified me that the dispute was not resolved in my favor, but this time because **#S** had \"ample evidence that we did, in fact, stay there\". Okay, it's game time now. I filed a third dispute, submitted even *more* evidence, and called them and explained the situation -- That **#S** is providing documentation that we willingly provided ***prior*** to cancellation, and they need to request more documentation before issuing a judgement. Unfortunately, this didn't happen, and they still ruled this third dispute in **#S**'s favor due to them providing **the same evidence** a second time. I tried one to submit one more dispute, with all the evidence I could gather, and called my credit card company multiple times to ensure they were following through. In the end, they still refused to issue a favorable judgement.\n\nNext, I tried calling Booking.com to see if they can assist with a refund. They told me that since the cancellation policy on the website shows that I was allowed a refund, they would handle getting it to me and would go after the hotel themselves. However, each time I called back I got a different story until I asked to speak to a supervisor who, in no specific words, told me I'm up üí© creek without a paddle and there was nothing Booking.com could/would do. However, the only shred of good news was that I learned that hotels on their site are responsible for listing their cancellation policies, so whatever a hotel lists is binding at the time of booking. Armed with my petty AF attitude &amp; the knowledge Booking.com gave me, I set out to file a small claims suit.\n\nReader, don't be fooled. Small claims are *not* as easy as they claim to be. Certain states bury information or require so much that you have to dedicate time just to gather it all. Nonetheless, I managed to scrounge up all the documentation needed and filed my suit in May 2022. It was officially go-time. I gathered *everything*, screenshots of **#S**'s cancellation policy, all the photos from **#W** and **#F** I could muster, videos, receipts, credit card statements, screenshots of texts and emails, I was even able to call **#N** and get a copy of my invoice from them (It had been well over a year at this point). All that alone totaled 28MB of data, which I know isn't a lot, but remember, it was just PDFs and screenshots, the largest file being a screenshot that was 2.5MB, most files were less than 900KB. Being that I live 10-12 hours away from the court based on traffic, I was able to upload all my evidence to the court case file and they agreed to swear me in via phone.\n\nAbout an hour ago (From the time I'm typing this), the court called me. I was sworn in and then explained everything -- the cancellation, the conditions and treatment at **#S**, the credit card disputes, how I wasn't requesting a full refund, just the portion that we are owed (We had to pay that cancellation fee, after all). It felt like a weight was finally lifted off my shoulders, *someone* is finally listening to me who can actually *do something*. Then it came time for **#S** to tell their side. They claimed that they had no documentation we actually checked out because they don't have the paperwork so they can't prove anything other than what's on paper. That was literally all they had to say. The judge then asked both of us a series of questions including how much the stay per night was, who was the person working the front desk, do I have any other evidence to enter besides what I've already submitted, etc. \n\nAfter everything was said and done, the judge sided with us. During this process, the guy representing **#S** decided it would be smart to try and tell the judge that our credit card company already denied our dispute 4 times, to which the judge replied \"The credit card company isn't the court, I am. I don't care what the credit card company said, it's clear they did not stay at your hotel\". Nice one, **#S**, add fuel to the flames. \n\nBecause this is a small claims suit, there are extra fees that have to be paid by the defendant, including the fee to serve court documents, the fee to file the suit petition, and a post judgement interest fee. So now, I'm just waiting for **#S** to pay me my $283.95 + $150 in court fees + 7.5% post judgement interest. They likely won't pay, and I'll have to file a judgement, but at least that gives me more petty revenge to add to this story. Hopefully you enjoyed the read! I know it's not as good as others, but I've been waiting for the day I could finally post this!\n\n\\-----\n\n**TL;DR** \\-- Two years, dozens of phone calls, a couple good cry sessions, and one lawsuit later, I finally got a scummy hotel to refund me $300.",

I hate using pop words like narcissistic, golden child, black sheep. But they all fit. Years of forgiveness and taking the blame because I felt everything was my fault as I was told. Even we'll into adulthood. I was raised believing I was worthless and maybe one day, I would work hard enough, be good enough to receive the same love and acceptance my four siblings did. But I was never ever enough. In fact the harder I worked the shittier I was treated.  Then through a conversation my mom let it be known to me that she knew that my bio father was SA my older siblings from birth to ages 6&amp;4. That she stayed with him because she loved him so much.   \n\nWell guess who realized then that my entire life was just more abuse. No clothes. No baths, no taking care of at all in anyway shape or form.  Birthdays became hate filled events. Gifts meant to embarrass. If there was a birthday. It wasn't me that was the issue. It was this child predator I was birthed by.  Well, the siblings took the witches side because she also has cancer. FYI people with cancer can still be horrible people. No sympathy from me there. Because I was 4 hiding in fear, five terrified, 6 afraid, all the way up to now.  I have memory after memory of abuse I can't escape from. So now I'm N C after a year of begging my family to believe me. But years of the witches manipulation and lies won.  Honestly I don't blame the for that. I was under the same spell. \n\n\nBut what I do blame them and her for is not leaving me alone. Especially on my birthday. \n\nThey don't answer texts or calls. Won't respond at all. But they send me shit on my birthday to ruin the day. \nBecause they know it does. \n\nSo here's my petty revenge. Every year, I hand the money to my JNMIL. My mother hates her along with the rest of my family. She on my list of least favorite people but she's learned to respect boundaries and back off over the last decade. \n\nSo my mother who uses money as a weapon gives the woman she hates birthday money every year.\n\nMy JNMIL knows . She knows why. We are very open and honest now. And she is petty enough to completely understand the only reason she gets the money is to piss my family off. \n\nI would starve to death before accepting anything from my family. I know this isn't a big one. But it's my win.",

Then it will be one breakup and one rejection on the same day for him. &lt;3 My sisters‚Äô friends will also help by spreading the info that that guy is a cheater so that more girls won‚Äôt fall victim to him.

I currently have satellite internet but was not to happy with it, spotty connection and such. \nI listen to the sales pitch trying to sell me the whole nine yards. I decide to get just the internet service. Cable company sets an appointment for two weeks to come in set up all the equipment and stuff to get us on their high speed internet. Two weeks come and go. Nothing. We call them. Apparently our order was written up incorrectly and they canceled it. Never told us. So I set another appointment up. Two-three weeks go by and nothin. Call them again and once again our order had been canceled for some odd reason. So I politely told them to keep their service that if that can‚Äôt manage to take care of setting me up how could I take their word I‚Äôll have the fantastic service the claim to have. \nFast forward to last month. Me and the Mrs are looking to save money. I have her call the cable co and get there price. Turns out it will save us $30 a month. Cool. She sets an appointment, they come out but can‚Äôt hook us up because the equipment the hook to on the pole is only 2port and not a 4 port and both ports are in use.  The guy calls in, sets up with whoever to change the port the following week and sets the install appointment for the week after. The day before the Tech is to come set us up the mrs calls to confirm that the work on the pole was done. They say it was and we‚Äôre good to go. Cool all set. NOT. Installer shows up , can‚Äôt install because work was not done. \nHe calls in an order again the leaves. We call the company to see what the heck is going on. We get it all settled and a crew will be over in the next couple days to do the work. Ok.  Four days later no crew.  We call. Now it will be up to 40 days before it will be done once it‚Äôs done they will set us up a appointment. \nBy this point I‚Äôm pretty pissed off. Do I cancel? Hell NO! I‚Äôm going to let them spend the money and resources to upgrade their pole to suit my needs and when they call to setup the service tell them to stick it up their ass.

        "text": "So me and my friends were talking about stores of when we were younger of things that we did were stupid,  when I remembered when I got petty revenge against my grandmother and her snooty friends. When I was young, I used to have issues with eating deviled eggs in that the devil himself would cook up some of the worst silent but deadly farts imaginable inside of me. They were so bad that they burned when they came out, left a terrible scent on the piece of furniture for a while, and would pretty much peel the paint off the walls. I love deviled eggs, but due to my farts I didn't eat many as a kid, I grew out of it as an adult though so I can eat as many as I want to now.\n\nWell years ago I was with my dad at the time who lived with my grandmother, whom of which was throwing a party with her upper class-ish friends, they had wealth but weren't super wealthy. In which she made a point in telling me not to eat the deviled eggs they had made for the party as she didn't want me to fart up the living room. Initially I was fine with that, yet as the party dragged on, they kept mocking me over and over again about not being able to eat the stupid eggs. Along with mocking me over the reason why being the terrible stench I emitted when I do. \n\nSo I eventually had enough and waited until they were out of the kitchen and in the living room to get my revenge. I ate the rest of the deviled eggs, I think it was like ten of them, been a few years, waited a bit, and then I felt it. I felt the devils work coming to fruition and sat my happy butt down in the middle of the couch and let it rip, and boy was it extra raunchy too. The smell hit the room almost immediately, and they tried to ignore it, yet it was too powerful and meant they moved out the living room to get away from it. Needless to say they were not happy with me, and I was grinning like the little turd that I was in that moment in time. I think I got grounded for the rest of the weekend too, I do know I got scolded, like I said its been a few years so my memory is a bit fuzzy on the smaller details, but I will never forget fart bombing the living room.",

        "text": "Eight years ago, my job of 10 yrs began failing &amp; my hrs got cut drastically. I was lucky enough to find a better paying job at a paint shop through Craigslist &amp; began a week later. The problem was, I was the only woman working there. I endured a lot of harassment from employees and customers, but it was a family owned company and the old me was too grateful towards them to take them to court. I was also a single mom &amp; so I stuck with that job bc the pay was good. However, by the third year there, I'd had enough, particularly because the self-appointed supervisor (think Dwight Schrute) was very unbearable, and unfair. He was the king of harassment and inappropriate behavior. I managed to find an even better job &amp; put in my two weeks notice.\n\nWhen I had a week left, I had a difficult customer who was wrong but was very rude and insisted on having his way, while belittling me. I called my \"supervisor\" over, to explain the situation to the customer. He backed me up, but once I clocked out for lunch (as I was hitting my 5th hr) I found out through my coworkers the supervisor changed his tune and began to trash-talk me to the customer. That was it. I grabbed my belongings and left. I text the owner to thank her for my employment and apologize for leaving before my two weeks were over &amp; explained what had happened. While the supervisor was getting a write-up ready for me for taking over an hour lunch, the owner showed up to the store to write HIM up. Needless to say, he wasnt happy. \n\nWell, fast forward a little over a year... I was promoted to a lead position at my new job. People awknowledged my skills (finally) and my boss let everyone know I was in charge within my dept. So guess who applied to work there, in my dept? Yup. Supervisor dude. My boss came up to me to ask about him, since he noticed he was coming from the same place I did. I told him of my experience with him right away and he didnt pursue him as an employee. Another year later, the guy applied again.  We had a different manager by then, and so my new boss took him on a tour of the warehouse, and brought him to me, telling him, \"This is (my name), she's in charge back here\". The look on his face was priceless. After finishing the tour, the guy tells  her thanks for the interview but this actually isnt a good fit for him, and he leaves. My boss was confused but I explained to her our history and she was just glad he decided to turn down the job offer. So was I.\n\nFrom what I heard, he struggled to find a job afterwards. He was determined to stay in the paint industry but other companies only offered part time or lower pay. \n\nMoral of the story? Dont f*ck your employees/coworkers over.",

I was an angry, troubled kid. Often skipping classes, finding trouble and being an ass to my parents whenever possible. Despite this, I turned out okay and I have a wonderful relationship with my parents today. But as a teen, I was a handful. \n\nA little relevant background, my dad was involved in local politics, even becoming the chairperson of a certain political party in our state. He was very passionate about affecting change as we lived in a state that was not partially progressive. I appreciated what he was doing, but I was also a little shithead so I definitely wasn't involving myself in his efforts either.\n\nMy senior year was turmultuous to say the least. I was often in trouble at school and at home, and was barely squeezing by to graduate. \nIn my required senior civics class, being almost 18, our teacher had us register to vote for the first time. A big moment for young adults! \n\nThis day came after a particularly heated fight with my dad the night before. I knew how important it was to him for me to register with the party he worked with. As I am a petty person, I decided now was my chance to take a dig at him and I registered as a member of the Green Party. \n\nI completely forgot about it until a week or so later when my registration came in the mail. My dad absolutely blew his fuse as he knew immediately what I'd done, and why. I laughed and refused to change it. My first true adult decision was to be petty.",

        "text": "Years ago I rented a room in a house with 3 room mates. The house was in a great location. Quiet street, near my work, fenced-in yard, a nice pool. All 3 of my room mates were fine. We lived together for 2 years and then it was time to renew the lease. I wanted to stay in the house for another year, but the 3 room mates weren't able to. 2 of them were getting ready to find apartments with their boyfriends, 1 was taking a job offer in another state.\n\nThe landlord said if I could find new room mates he would renew the lease. I would get to upgrade to the master bedroom which had a private bathroom and a walk-in closet. I was pretty excited about it. My friend and her coworker were looking for a place, so I talked to them about it. I was exceedingly clear that I didn't want to live in a party house. We talked for a while about how I had been through that in a previous living situation. They promised that they weren't like that. We found a third room mate on Craig's List.\n\nIt went downhill so fast. The Craig's List roomie was actually great. It was my friend and her friend who started throwing parties like 4-5 nights a week. I had to be up at 5am during the week for work. They'd bring groups of people home from the bar at like 2am, no regard for noise. Often strangers from the bar would block my car in. They'd eat my food, leave messes/garbage everywhere, stuff like that.\n\nI tried talking to them as respectfully as possible and it never went well. The friend-of-friend ended up being very combative. She put a sign with the C-word on my door. I don't even remember all the little slights, but she was on a mission to drive me out of the house. It all got to be too much so I found a new place to live. Craig's List Roomie decided that he wanted to move out as well. We told the remaining room mates, they said they had friends who would take the empty rooms.\n\nAnyway, the entire house was furnished by my previous room mates who had left it all to me. Nothing in the house belonged to the landlord. I sorted everything out with the landlord, had my name removed from the lease. I had the internet cable/disconnected because it was in my name. Then I made a post on FB marketplace.\n\n\"Fully-furnished house, everything must go. FREE\"\n\nMy very first response was from a guy who said he had a big moving truck and could take everything. No idea why, I didn't ask. He came and emptied the house. All that was left was whatever belonged to the remaining room mates. The friend-of-friend roomie came home just as the man was pulling out of the driveway. She walked in, saw the empty house, looked at me and said \"You're a fucking bitch!\" then stormed off to her room. I could hear her on the phone crying about what happened \"She took EVERYTHING!\" \n\nIt was definitely my most petty moment but I don't regret it at all.",

        "text": "Hi. Some kind fella in another subreddit suggested this might also fit in here (and in yet another subreddit). If it doesn't, please tell me and I'll delete this post.\n\n------------------------\n\nHello. I know this story might be quite the same as other stories posted here, but this happened to me, quite a long time ago. Here it goes (TL;DR at the end):\n\nOh, the usual disclaimer: English is not my main language, but I'm trying my best. Any correction is appreciated. Thanks in advance.\n\nENs: Entitled Neighbours. They are 2:\n\n1. HPL: High-Pitched lady\n2. TD: Tall dude\n\nNOB: Nice Old Bloke\n\nWhen I was much younger, I had the chance of living a bit far from my hometown in a semi-rural area, at some place with a nice green space, next to a very nice neighbour, with her own green space adjacent to mine. It was some closed neighbourhood, with a few common expenses for maintenance of the inner roads and such stuff, yet not with a HOA in the same way as in the USA (according to what I read around here). There were just a few homes there (between 25 to 35, I can't recall exactly now) and everybody had an equal vote on issues regarding the common spaces and issues. There was never any problem. Really: never.\n\nMy nice neighbour was a lady in her fifties. She was very funny, witty, smart, really lovely. She had a bf, who used to be there from Friday to Sunday every week, and he was equally nice. Adorable people both of them, really.I always helped her with her green space (quite more than a garden) whenever I took care of mine, which was quite often. I didn't mind helping her with that, since her bf wasn't able to (it wasn't that easy for him to do that stuff since he had some back issues and was getting treatment for it) and for me it wasn't a big deal. And after all the tasty stuff she cooked and gave me (\"hey, try this, tell me if you like it\" was a recurrent sentence), it was the least I could do. Also her two dogs were with me all the time when I was in her place, and they were adorable.\n\nWell, as it happens, one day they decided to move to some city quite a few hundred kilometres from there (and get married!), so she put the house on sale. Some people came to see the house, which was beautiful. So I was doing the usual gardening work at her place when the couple who later bought the house were first visiting. I didn't pay much attention but I remembered afterwards it was them because she (the girl in the couple) had a very distinctive voice, in a very high pitch, yet not unpleasant. Her unpleasantness would show later, but not regarding her voice. Also her husband was very much taller than her. Like two heads taller. TD (Tall Dude) from now on.\n\nOne day my neighbour and her bf said their goodbyes, left with me a few things to donate (the ones they couldn't take care of), some for me if I wanted (I didn't, save for one great cast iron pan that somehow they wouldn't take), and left. I was sad to see them go, but they were chasing a good future together, so I was also happy for them.\n\nWell, the new neighbours (ENs from now on) the got there one day, and I had been told beforehand by the realtor, so I worked a bit on their green space in order for it to look nice.\n\nThe ENs didn't say their hello, yet I didn't mind. They had their right to be less sociable than other people are, and unless they were annoying I was OK with that.\n\nA couple of days after they moved, I was taking care of the grass in my property, cutting some dried branches of a tree (plum), and other things, and HPL called me (I'm translating): \"Hey, boy, when you finish there you gotta do some work here too, the grass is quite grown and we have more stuff to do.\" I was a bit confused at first but then I remembered that when they first visited I was doing gardening stuff for my former neighbour, and that's why she must've thought it was my duty. I got close to her and explained her that I was doing maintenance of my property, that I was friends with my former neighbour and about her BF's situation and why I was helping her. She said \"OK\" and went inside her house.\n\nA few days later (could've been three days) there was the monthly neighbours' meeting. After a few issues were debated (mostly about a few bumps in the dirt roads), both ENs said they had an issue, and HPL said that I was refusing to do my chores and that I should get a reprimand and not be paid in full. I was quiet and calm and was about to speak when another homeowner, who was aware of my relationship with my former neighbour, said \"he was never getting paid, he doesn't do any work for any of us, he was helping her neighbour, that is.\" I added that I had already told her that and that I explained to her my relationship with my neighbour (and her BF), and that I thought I made it quite clear. TD then said that when they visited the house they saw me doing the gardening and assumed that it was included with the common expenses, so it could be said they bought the property under those assumptions. At that moment I was quite amused because the whole issue was ridiculous. I told them something like this (not the exact words, after these years I can't recall every single term): \"I'm sorry that you thought my gardening came for free with the house. It came for free with the relationship I had with my former neighbour, and that's it. No one told you that I would be working for you for free (or under common expenses), and your own assumptions are just flawed, I'm sorry.\" At that point, HPL lost her temper and shouted at me that I was disrespecting her husband and her husband's authority (‚ÄΩ), that I was rude and a bully (an accusation without any truth) and that I was purposefully refuse doing their gardening. After her screaming show there was a very, very long and uncomfortable silence. I had never witnessed anyone shouting in those meetings, which were very amicable and quiet. So I broke the silence and told her \"After what I'm going to say I will ask my new neighbours to explicitly point out in which ways I was, according to them, rude and a bully. I would also like to know in which ways I disrespected her husband and his supposed authority. And also which authority do they think they have over me. On the other hand, they are right: I purposefully refused to do their gardening. And I will assure you that I will never do it, not even if they want to pay for it.\"\n\nThey shut up and left before the meeting was over. Yes, we (the rest) stayed a bit afterwards talking about what happened. It was impossible not to.\n\nAnd then I went to the ENs' neighbour, a nice old bloke (NOB) who invited me and a couple other homeowners over. He lived to the OTHER side of the ENs. He offered us cappuccinos (yay!) or teas (he seemed to know a lot about tea). While there I had this idea and I told him \"Hey, I can come a couple days a week for a little while to take care of your plants and trees (more like bushes, really) and I can have a cappuccino here.\" He agreed. I had a triple interest in this: 1) The cappuccinos. 2) Angering ENs, who will see I do some gardening to their other neighbour. 3) NOB's granddaughter, who was beautiful and I had already seen her around. It all went well: cappuccinos were great, ENs were furious, and NOB's granddaughter ended up being a good friend of mine and introducing me to a friend of hers who would then become my GF (until she died only 6 months later, but that's another story).Oh, I also had another interest: NOB's library: He had great books and he lent them to me.\n\nI know it's not a very interesting story, but I think it depicts a couple of entitled individuals.\n\nI have a couple more ones with them (I lived there some four years), but enough for now.\n\nImportant note: While the facts were as I wrote here, some words might not be entirely precise, because this happened more than 25 years ago and I can't recall every single word.\n\n‚Äã\n\nTL;DR. new neighbours think that because I did gardening (and more) for my former neighbour, that means said chores were included with their new house.\n\nEdit: NOB was EN's other neighbour, to the other side of their property.",

        "text": "I randomly shared this story the other day and realized it is probably my best r/PettyRevenge  material.\n\nI met my dad the day before my 9th birthday when I came to live with him. It is a long story and needless to say it was a complicated and difficult time of my life. He had a girlfriend at the time who we quickly moved in with and he married. She was 26 years old and they met in rehab.\n\nMy dad and stepmom had a lot of flaws but for the most part we all tried at being a family. She later cheated on my dad and divorced him so I don‚Äôt feel too bad about all this in hindsight. \n\nOur first Christmas together, she was adamant about getting stockings and a tree. She wrote our name in glitter on the stockings and decorated them all nice. I found out later that she was also responsible for filling the stockings.\n\nOn Christmas morning we empty and go through our stockings before we open presents. My stocking has 2 lottery scratchers and they each have 4 lottery tickets. They win a free ticket and like a $2 prize but the rest were duds. \n\nI saved my scratchers for later because I was more excited about my little toys and my upcoming presents. After every thing was opened up and I‚Äôm going back through what I got, I find the scratchers. \n\nI borrow a penny to scratch it on the table and I win $50 dollars! I was so excited. I had never won anything before and never had more than $10 of my own money. I‚Äôm literally jumping up and down for the joy and yelling.\n\nMy soon to be stepmom comes up and congratulates me. She then says that she bought the scratchers and you have to be 18 years old to redeem them. She holds out her hand and says she will take it to the store and get the money for me.\n\nI don‚Äôt think anything at the time and hand over the ticket. A couple days later she hands me $25 dollars and says she kept half for gas and because she bought the tickets. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I got upset. I was so excited for $50 dollars and now already half is just gone? \n\nI tried to complain to my dad and he brushed me off. I was essentially told not to be ungrateful. I didn‚Äôt start planning my revenge then. I stumbled into my revenge through either fate or luck.\n\nMy parents bought their first house a few months later and got married around the same time with help from their parents. It was directly behind the Arden Fair Mall in Sacramento. The backyard literally had a big cement wall and on the other side was a giant parking lot and then Nordstroms.\n\nAround my 10th birthday, my dad starts handing me a $5 bill periodically and asking me to walk to the mall and get him Starbucks (it was a little over 10 minutes of walking each way). Sometimes it was a $10 dollar bill but I was always allowed to keep the change. After my first time going to the mall by myself it was like a whole new world opened up.\n\nMy friends and I would go out and play every day and now we had a whole new playground. We weren‚Äôt obnoxious brats or anything but we walked all over and checked out tons of stores. \n\nWhich is how I found the store Spencers. As a 10 year old, it was the coolest store ever. I must have gone there over a dozen times and even by myself. This led to my golden discovery and my petty revenge story.\n\nGag lottery tickets. They appear just like normal lottery tickets but with funny names. I can‚Äôt remember the name of the one I bought but I remember the back saying to redeem it you had to mail it to the North Pole addressed to Santa Claus and even something about the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy.\n\nI was getting $5 a week in allowance at that point and bought two. I gave one to my friend randomly and said I found it. It was hilarious for both of us. I held on to the other ticket for over 2 months.\n\nFinally Christmas Eve comes and the stockings are hung. I waited until just before bed to put the ticket in my now Stepmom‚Äôs stocking because I was nervous she would find it. Christmas morning comes and the stockings are full. The difference is we are joined by her sister, sister‚Äôs husband, and her parents.\n\nStockings get passed around first and every one digs in. Stepmom loudly exclaims that there‚Äôs an extra lottery ticket in her stocking but people are talking and don‚Äôt comment on it. Stepmom immediately grabs the scissors and starts scratching her lottery tickets.\n\nThe first is a dud and I realize she is saving mine for last. Hers are all duds. She starts scratching the final ticket. I see her get excited and all of a sudden she‚Äôs screaming that she won. $250,000 dollars. She gets up and runs to my dad and hugs him. She pulls away and she‚Äôs wiping her wet eyes.\n\nI start to feel bad. I pipe up, ‚ÄúYou should read the back.‚Äù \n\nShe looks at me like what the hell are you talking about. I awkwardly repeat that she should read the back. She turns the ticket over, starts reading, and I watch the excitement die in her eyes.\n\nShe slammed the ticket down and I knew she was livid. My only saving grace was her sister and her husband thought it was hilarious and her parents told her to calm down it was just a joke. My dad scolded me later saying pranks are fine as long as they aren‚Äôt mean but that was that was mean in my stepmom‚Äôs eyes.",

        "text": "This is a story from a simpler place and time.\n\nI lived in northern Italy for a couple of years. I shared a second-story apartment with a roommate. Our building was one of the many high-rise apartment buildings along a narrow street, which ran a short distance from near the center of town to the foot of the mountain. Most of the residents were normal everyday families, and most of the men were railroad workers, factory workers, and so on.\n\nIt seemed like every teenager in the city owned a motorino. Owning and keeping an automobile was expensive, but motorini were affordable. Google for \"Piaggio Ciao\" if you want to see one.\n\nAir conditioning was not a thing back then, so in the night we opened all the windows in our apartment and let the night breezes cool us while we slept. \n\nOne night I was awakened at about 1 a.m. by the sounds of revving motorino engines. The kids were having motorino races, from the *piazzetta* two buildings down, to the foothills at the other end of the street. I grumbled and stumbled through the living room, ready to lean out the window and give them a piece of my mind. Then I saw the silhouette of my roommate, sitting serenely at the front window, with a whole row of 500-ml yogurt cups lined up on the sill in front of him.\n\nEvery time a motorino raced past, he would grab a cup and fling the water at them, then silently go and refill the cup. He never showed himself, never said a word. But I leaned discreetly out of the window and admired the splash pattern on the street just below us.\n\nHe was seriously soaking the racers, but it took them a while to figure out what was happening to them. When they did figure it out, and they found the wet spots on the street, they knew where they were getting hit, but not where they were getting hit *from* . All they knew was that it was one of the apartments in the surrounding buildings. So they rode their motorini in little circles in the street below, shaking their fists and gesturing to the apartments above them, while hollering, \"*O! Vieni gi√π, eh?\"* and threatening their unknown tormenters.\n\nAnd that's when half of the windows on the street opened up, and everybody started yelling at them to go home, let us get some sleep, we have to get up in the morning, leave or we'll call the police on you, and so on -- and, in true Italian style, to rain down more upon them than just 500-ml water bombs.\n\nYeah. In less than 5 minutes, the street was quiet, and everybody went back to bed. Honestly, the motorini never again used our street for their midnight drag races. Nobody but my roommate and me know that he was the badass that had chased them away.",

They didn't carry the cat litter brand I use or have gallons of urine remover, but I picked up a smaller size and a substitute litter to tide me over. \n\nI pay, and asked if they have a restroom because my daughter is nagging me to go. The clerk curtly says they do have a restroom, but it's for employees only, and lists off nearby establishments with public restrooms. So I put my stuff in the car and we walked across the street to the Jack In The Box. They wanted me to buy something to use the restroom, so I'm annoyed, but purchased a small drink. \n\nWe head back to the car and a different employee is outside sweeping. She sees us coming from the Jack In The Box and loudly states \"our parking is for customers only\". I put my daughter in the car, grabbed my litter and urine remover, and walked past her into the store while saying \"So sorry, I won't do it again!\" I returned my items while the parking lot girl looked on with a shocked Pikachu face. The manager tried to apologize, and I accepted her apology, saying it's no problem at all! I'm sorry I bothered them. Then I drove to Petco and bought what I actually wanted.",

        "text": "Boy oh boy would i have some stories for this subreddit. Most of it was the usual pay back‚Ä¶. Posting someones phone number on Craigslist asking men to send them photos, subscribing them to spam emails etc. \n\nBut the funniest, most pettiest thing I did was after my (30F) most recent ex (nearly 27F) broke up with me. \n\nTw mention of SH and attempted suicide\n\nFirstly, context: \n\nBefore dating, my ex Jess (fake name) and I were best friends. I was never really one to become attached to friends easily, but within 3.5 short years we created the most beautiful connection I have ever been apart of. \n\nTogether, we climbed out of the our respective rock bottoms and inspired each other to put our lives back together. We would have the most intense and in depth conversations about our trauma, upbringing, mental illness and past experiences. Then discuss why we are the way we are and do the things that we do. To this day she remains the only person in the world - by far - who comes close to knowing who I am deep down.\n\nThis girl was someone I had thought of as the girl of my dreams. \n\nWe started dating and it was absolute heaven. At first. Then, as it often happens, a bunch of stuff transpired that im not going to go into here (maybe in comments but I‚Äôm not here to write a novella). \n\nThen came The Break Up. \n\nI went to my friends place for drinks during the night of the Australia Federal Election 2022. Politics is something I really enjoy, as does my friend. Yes, maybe I could‚Äôve invited Jess but it wasn‚Äôt her scene and she went out drinking with her work mates so i thought it would all be good. \n\nSpoiler alert: it was not. \n\nShe started off by sending me nice, cute drunk messages. How i was the love of her life etc etc. Then I fucked up. Majorly. \n\nI didn‚Äôt respond for 12. Whole. Minutes. \n\nThen Jess started sending me message after message full of abuse and untrue accusations. I replied a couple times but eventually decided that there was no reasoning with her in this state and blocked on her on iMessage, with the plan to wait for her to calm down and discuss properly in person the next day. I admittedly, and a bit selfishly, didn‚Äôt want her to ruin my night. \n\nI counted the next day and from memory she sent over 100messages in a 20min period before she was blocked. Who knows how many she sent all up. \n\nLater that night i checked Facebook to see where Jess‚Äôs head was at. She had the tendency to post status‚Äôs/memes when we were fighting, so I wanted to try to gauge whether if she: switched back to enjoying the night with friends, was upset and ashamed of her reaction, was sad posting, or the most likely option that she was angry. \n\nShe had actually blocked me and tbh i gave her a lil nod of respect regarding her pettiness. I was like ‚Äúyeah, nah, thats fair hey‚Äù. \n\nSo the next day I checked to see whether she had unblocked me. Turns out she did but‚Ä¶\n\nShe had changed her Facebook relationship status to single. \n\nAnd thats how i found out we had broken up. \n\nIt was fucking devastating. I wouldve been broken hearted by anyone splitting up with me in such a way. But the fact that it was this girl? The person i trusted the most? The one i thought understood and loved me more than anyone else ever had before? The person I supported through thick and thin only to be treated like fucking shit (not only this occasion tho tbf)? \n\nDEVASTATING is the only word that comes close to describing it. \n\nIt nearly ruined me. I lost what little trust I had in others. My sense of self worth was non existent. I self harmed. And when that wasn‚Äôt enough, I tried to hang myself. Which led me to be temporarily prescribed Seroquel on top of my usual Abilify, my sisters unofficially placed me on suicide watch, and I underwent a tonne of therapy. \n\nBut, they say grief has five stages and when anger hit, it hit hard. \n\nLess than a month later, a mutual friend invited me to go to the movies to see Jurassic World: Dominion. I was worried about seeing Jess there as the Jurassic franchise was her absolute most favourite movie series in the world. She had been looking forward to watching it since it was announced and i knew she had plans that she constantly bought up to see it at the theatres. \n\nThen said friend jokingly suggested it. The most pettiest revenge I‚Äôve ever done and definitely the one most tailored for its victim. \n\nYou can probably guess it. \n\nI spoiled it. \n\nI went to watch that movie and you can bet the entire time i was only paying attention to which important twists i could ruin for her. \n\nThen I went to work the next day, borrowed my co workers phone in case Jess had blocked mine, and sent her a brief message of 2-3 sentences containing major spoilers for the movie. I purposely made them subtle too, so that shed read the whole thing before realising what it contained. \n\nOur mutual friend sent me a screenshot a couple hours later of a status she made on facebook regarding it. \n\nPoetry in motion, I swear. \n\nAnyway, maybe it was beneath me. Maybe I should‚Äôve been the better woman. But ill be honest, this revenge in particular cheered me up more than anything else i was trying at the time. It was the first step in a marathon of leaps I‚Äôve taken me to try and recover from her abandonment and betrayal. But I now believe that one day I may even make it across the finish line.",

The letter also warns that if anyone from the college were to contact my family, it will be considered harassment and legal action will be taken. \n\nThis is a conservative Christian college, so I hope many on here know where this is in.

        "text": "I‚Äôve been in the electrical trade for a long time. Back in 2008 when everything fell out, residential electrical work slowed down. I went got a job with a commercial company making more money! I have long hair but am very skilled in my trade and hard working. The owner assumed I was a slacker and treated me as such. One day we had to add some wires to an existing pipe that had wire in it. To do this you take a thin metal wire on a roll called a fish tape, push it through the pipe, the guy on the other end ties the wire on, and then you pull. Easy as that right, well it took 2 hours to get that tape through that pipe. While I was standing there catching my breath, mopping up the sweat, and waiting for the guy on the other end to get the new wire tied on the fish tape, the owner of the company walked into the room.  He looked at me standing there waiting assuming I was doing nothing and yelled: What are you waiting for!! Pull that fish tape!! And proceeded to rip the fish tape out of the pipe before I could say NOOOO! The guy on the other end started yelling and 2 hours later I got that tape back through that pipe. \n\nNow for the petty revenge!!\n\n The next day I came into work like any other day. Electricians have a lot of pieces parts on the jobs. The room I was standing in the day before had all our material stacked against a wall. I swept a clean spot and moved all the material to the clean spot. I then proceeded to sweep the entire room clean. After I got done sweeping I moved all the material back to were it was. This took me 8 hours. All day guys would look in the room and say: Hey man we need your help out here. Then they would see me moving and say: Oh, you‚Äôre busy! And roll out. A journeyman electrician running a broom all day sweeping a floor that didn‚Äôt need to be swept. I‚Äôll show you doing nothing!\n\n\nIn this if you‚Äôre not sure what you want to do for a career, electrical has proven to be recession and pandemic proof.",

        "text": "This happened to my partner and I a couple of years ago:\n\nWe live in the UK, and in 2019 I got a really good job in a new city in the Midlands. After a few months of commuting we decided to move closer as my partner could find job easily.\n\nWe booked several viewings with prices ranging from ¬£600 to ¬£1200 per month. After serious consideration we decided that the long-term goal was to buy a property, so we decided to go for the cheapest place in order to save money for the deposit faster.\n\nNow, this house was in one of the roughest neighbourhoods I've ever lived in. The streets were covered in rubbish, people would be shouting outside in the middle of the night, police would be constantly passing by, you'd find needles in the park nearby and drunk/drugged people laying around all the time.\n\nAs per the house, it was a wreck but we knew what we were getting into, just looking at the big picture of getting our own home. \n\nWe agree to move and pay the ¬£600 deposit plus month's rent in advance landlord requests to keep his mail, didn't sign a contract (I know but we were young and naive), payment to be done in cash, do not change the pre paid electricity meter, etc. But he said there's no need to register for council tax because he'd cover it, in the UK council tax is usually well over ¬£100 per month and it's normally the tenant who pays for it, this will be VERY important later.\n\nMoving day comes and the house is a mess, like a proper mess the converted loft is full of rubbish, they left a bed behind and when we moved it there was years of q-tips, rubbish, even underwear from the previous tenant. There was a thick layer of grease throughout the kitchen, i guess you get the picture. We took pictures (but later lost them when i changed phone and didn't do transfer of files).\n\nAnother important detail is that in the year we lived there, landlord went on holiday to Sri Lanka, Dubai, Australia, and somewhere else I cannot remember. Also drove a very expensive car, when he came to collect rent he'd make comments like... Oh yeah had a barbecue in my new jacuzzi, etc. You'll know soon why this is important.\n\nNearly one year passes and we fine a shared ownership in a new development in a better area, which together with the amount of money we managed to save, we can afford! We get our mortgage and notify the landlord with three months notice. \n\nI request to not pay the last month and he could just keep the deposit, but he refused. About one week before moving out I accidentally open a letter from the council in his name, before noticing the name in the letter I realise it's a council tax bill... But it's not hundreds, not even tens of pounds per month, it's ¬£40-something FOR THE YEAR! And notice that the reason for this is that he'd been awarded housing benefits for\"living alone\" in my rented house and being in \"low pay\". \n\nMoving day comes, unlike how the house was upon moving in, we cleaned the property upside-down just to be told by the landlord that he's keeping the deposit due to the carpet being dirty etc... \n\nNow that did infuriate me as I had lost the moving day pictures of the dirty house, i argued that the house was then in better state of maintenance than when we moved in, but to no avail.\n\nI need to mention that even losing the deposit, the money we saved in council tax still made it beneficial to us. But I'm a petty b-word and I was very much done with landlord maliciousness.\n\nPetty revenge: I called the city council and with my most innocent voice said that I'd been living in the property for a year and just seen a council tax bill filled with benefits for my landlord and thought it was \"not ok\". The previously monotonous voice of the person at the other side of the phone immediately lifted up in excitement and asked a lot more questions. Then thanked me and we hung up.\n\nThat was everything until recently we saw our former neighbours, apparently landlord lost his benefits, and was driving a much cheaper car, the house is currently for sale.\n\nI think the world is a bit better today.",
