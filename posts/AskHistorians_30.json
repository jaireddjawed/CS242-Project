So why did their languages more or less die out in large numbers by the 21st century?\n\n  \nWhy don't we see a mosiac of immigrant languages across the US starting in the 19th century and continuing to today? Based on all this immigration I would imagine a US where say, german or swedish is a language used at home for many americans, and then communication between different language groups would be done in english. So an italian family would communicate with each other in italian, and with a german or irish family in english. Why don't we see this on any large scale in the 21st century?\n\nAnother question I have then, is for immigrants that have arrived in the 21st and late 20th century (primarily from latin america and asia), are their languages also in the process of dying out in america?  Has there been any recorded evidence of this? How long does it take for a language to die, and what can be done to preserve linguistic diversity? Are there any policies that have been shown to retain immigrant languages longer? Or are tagalog and hindi destined to go the way of german in the US?",

But what were the actual constraints on pre-marital sexual activity at this time, whether medical (STDs and/or pregnancy) or social? My assumption is they wouldn't be having sex, but were they, say, making out? \n\nPut another way, if I were reading *Middlemarch* at the time it was published in 1871-1872, what might I assume Rosamund and Lydgate were getting up to behind closed doors? Was George Eliot for the most part reflecting the social norms of the time, or was she limited (by obscenity laws, by publishing norms, etc.) in terms of what she could actually put in print?

        "text": "There is a replica stone on a pedestal in Delphi along the sacred way in the location where the original omphalos was found. But if Ancient Greeks regarded it as the Center of the Earth then its location is surprising.\n\nAssuming that this is the original location, it's not even the center of a building. It's just off to the side of some stairs leading up to the Athenian Treasury. There's even a visible foundation for another building right next to it.\n\nWouldn't this sort of thing at least merit some sort of monument? Was it moved? Do we just not know?",
