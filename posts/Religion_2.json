Who exactly is picking and choosing these stories, and do they not also realize about all the stuff that's in there? It's just weird, because you would expect the best book of all time to be one that you could just open to any page and then read an amazing story in it, and that seems to be you exactly what Christians think the Bible is, but if you do actually just open up the Bible to a random page, chances are you're going to land on something that's pretty uninspiring. So why do Christians seem to not realize this?",

In 1984 he says he was awake and received a vision of WW3, how that all played out, and how that led to the Battle of Armageddon that is talked about at the end of the Bible. He then says that God would send him honey as a sign that it wasn’t a lie and the next day he had honey sent to his doorstep. \nHe now has a charity and, though I think he’s not alive anymore, went around telling his story as a warning. What would  a non-Christian say about this? It feels hard to believe he’s just straight up lying because he dedicated his life to this, and (although I haven’t looked into if he actually did serve and get tortured) it seems more unlikely for him to undergo something that extreme all for a lie. So he likely at leasts beliefs it himself.\n\nAre there any examples of this type of thing happening outside of Christianity, even outside of the Abrahamic religions?",

But then I see them and other people in society decide to act stupid and turn other cheek. \n\nThat how it was during a little during my early teenage years. \n\nI used to be soo a ashamed, guilty, at times. And I would go insane for not being abld to stop. \n\nI started studying abroad, left my country for a while. I it was just all girls everywhere. \n\nI stopped feeling guilty, shame or remorse. I doesn’t hurt me as It used to. \n\nThey are so obsessed with this concept called “ marriage “ which I see but do nothing but disappoint and fail. \n\nIt used to be early marriage, because well, it made sense at the time considering dating wasn’t allowed. \n\nBut now, since marriage isn’t possible , people around my age can’t afford to get married so, what should I do? Wait until im 30 so I can afford it , to keep myself sexually repressed for years, just so I could get married.\n\nFuck that. \n\nThey expect good little angels, avoid porn, not look at girls, and stay religious during those years. Well, I’ve got news for you.\n\nThe manipulative restrictive mindset pushed to a point where I even stopped caring about praying strictly everyday. \n\nNothing about being muslim in a muslim society makes sense to me anymore.",

I’ve had Christian friends as well and even they’d tell me there’s so much difference in practices of each Christian as well. It seems that regardless of religion, no one has clear answers with proof of anything besides just telling you what’s in a book, something in a science museum, or just repetition of what they’ve been taught to believe. I remember once asking a simple question to a fellow Muslim brother “HOW DO YOU KNOW THERES AN AFTERLIFE, OR HEAVEN AND HELL?  WOULDN'T YOU HAVE TO DIE TO SEE THAT AND BE ABLE TO TELL OTHERS ABOUT IT?”\nInstead of answering, he got upset and was appalled that I would ask such a thing. He said to not question things. There’s my confusion. It’s like all or most religions are teaching you things they don’t know of themselves. See, I’m a regular meat and potatoes type of guy, and if someone just tells me “I don’t know”, that, I can respect but to tell me a lie or instruct me not to question things is crazy. I started to just believe I’m here and I’m alive and I’ll live life to the fullest, respectfully, and honestly and when I die, I die. Some say religions are out there just to give you purpose. Some say religions are out there to just give you structure in life. Others say, it’s all just a bunch of made up things that kept getting edited along the way. What’s your thought on all this?",

        "text": "Christianity has an issue with homosexuality that seems to stem largely from St Paul's letters. The only other mentions seem to be Leviticus, and no one pays attention to 99% of Leviticus or they'd be following strict dietary laws and stoning people to death.\n\nI have not studied this in depth at all but just dipping my feet in the water.\n\nFrom a very cursory glance it seems the Greek language used by St Paul is not very precise in its meaning to a reader outwith Paul's time and local area, the first known use of *arsenokoitēs* is from Paul afaik. \n\nPaul seems to be very concerned about sexual immorality within the churches he set up.\n\nIt seems reasonable to me that what worried St Paul is exactly what has been happening within the Church for the last 2000yrs and that he was right to worry. [This](https://news.stv.tv/world/polish-tv-report-pope-john-paul-ii-knew-of-abuse-as-archbishop) &amp; [this](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/thousands-abused-by-members-portuguese-church-past-70-years-2023-02-13/) sort of thing, just a few thousand cases from the past few weeks but you get the idea.....these don't appear to be isolated cases.\n\nI suspect Paul was not very worried about emotionally and financially stable monogamous homosexual couples adopting, for example, as this idea would be pretty alien to him, but was in fact very much worried about the sexual abuse of power within the church on the vulnerable which continues on a massive scale to this day and is often homosexual in nature.\n\nThe links I provided are linked to the Catholic Church but it seems to be some Protestant Churches that take the homophobia to extreme levels using the words of Paul.\n\nI do think St Thomas Aquinas had a massive influence on homophobia, and animal abuse but that is another matter, and Christians for a thousand years have used his writings and influence, often without knowledge of him, to persecute homosexuality. Aquinas himself seems to consider it on par with any sexual activity not relating to reproduction regardless if it is between a married heterosexual couple or not, but this seems to have been minimized and the homophobia maximized. Unknowingly cherry picking if you will. \n\nTL:DR\n\nI think St Paul was concerned about sexual abuse within the church which has been a huge issue from his time to ours and is a very valid concern. I don't think the writings of St Paul demonstrate that Christians should oppose gay marriage, adoption or involvement in the church.\n\nThoughts?",
