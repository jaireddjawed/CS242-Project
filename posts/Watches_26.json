        "text": "Hello dear Watchfam\n\nLast year I bought a Cartier Santos via ebay.\n\nUnfortunately, after bringing the watch to a trader, I found out that it is a (very high end) fake. The movement is a cheap (presumably Seiko or Miyota - with all the due respect for Japanese movements) with a fake \"Cartier\" signed rotor and other parts missing from it, when compared to an original one. Additionally, the bezel is not in real gold either - this was checked by using an XRF gun.\n\nThe watch trader said that this is one of the most accurate replicas he has ever seen and it would be very difficult for anyone to notice any discrepancies unless the caseback is opened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason why I am posting here is to prevent other people from being scammed. If you recently bough a Cartier Santos in from Ebay UK, please bring it to a watchmaker or to a Cartier store and ask them to check it!\n\nTo help further, I have compiled a list of usernames that this scammer has been using recently. These watches have been sold from 2022 and they all follow the same pattern - and even more suspiciously, the warranty cards have the same hand written date. **MOST IMPORANTLY, somehow the seller is able to evade the Authenticity Warranty that ebay applies to all the wrist watches being sold for £1500+** \n\nI've also been able to list most of the Cartier watches that have been sold following this pattern. It should be noted that the seller is also listing IWC and Tag Heuer watches, again by evading the Authenticity Warranty. I can't be certain that also those are fakes... but use your judgement.\n\nAs you can see, in the list below, I censored most of the serial numbers to respect any potential buyers... if you suspect that one of the watches is yours, please DM me an I will try to give you more info (if I can).\n\nI will be reporting all this information to Cartier, Actionfraud, The Met Police and the Ombudsman (if it gets to that point).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPLEASE - upvote this post so it can reach as many people as possible!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**llcoolclaude-247**\n\n*Ex-demo Cartier Santos Large Model All Steel WSSA0009 New Condition + Warranty*\n\no\tEbay number 285171559107\n\no\tWatch s/n 4072138570XX\n\no\tSold on 08/03/2023\n\n\\-\tEx-demo Cartier Santos Large Model All Steel WSSA0009 New Condition + Warranty\n\no\tEbay number 285109143330\n\no\tWatch s/n 40721\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 19/01/2023\n\n*Ex-demo Cartier Santos Large Model 18K Gold &amp; Steel W2SA0006 New Condition \\[same serial as 285109143330 ?\\]*\n\no\tEbay number 285135151569\n\no\tWatch s/n 407213\\*\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 10/02/2023\n\n*Ex-demo Cartier Santos Large Model 18K Gold &amp; Steel W2SA0006 New Condition*\n\no\tEbay number 285120826016\n\no\tWatch s/n 407213\\*\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 29/01/2023\n\n*Ex-demo Cartier Santos Large Model 18K Gold &amp; Steel W2SA0006 New Condition 2021*\n\no\tEbay number 285175761547\n\no\tWatch s/n 407213\\*\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 13/03/2023 (currently on sale)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**hacksawtdeegan**\n\n*Cartier Santos Automatic 35 mm Medium Model Steel 18K Gold W2SA0007 March 2030\\]*\n\no\tEbay number 144961803539\n\no\tWatch s/n 407513\\*\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 28/02/2023\n\n*NEW Cartier Santos Automatic 35mm Medium Model Steel WSSA0010 Warranty Jan 2031*\n\no\tEbay number 144959151575\n\no\tWatch s/n 407513\\*\\*\\*\\*X1\n\no\tSold on 23/02/2023\n\n*NEW Cartier Santos Automatic 35mm Medium Model Steel WSSA0010 Warranty Dec 2028* \n\no\tEbay number 144943906333\n\no\tWatch s/n 407513\\*\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 18/02/2023\n\n*Cartier Santos Automatic 35mm Medium Model Steel WSSA0010 Warranty Nov 2028*\n\no\tEbay number 144935169696\n\no\tWatch s/n 40751\\*\\*\\*\\*9XX\n\no\tSold on 12/02/2023\n\n*NEW Cartier Santos Automatic 35mm Medium Model Steel WSSA0010 Warranty Dec 2028 \\[same as 144943906333\\]*\n\no\tEbay number 144916185578\n\no\tWatch s/n 407513\\*\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 30/01/2023\n\n*NEW Cartier Santos Automatic 35mm Medium Model Steel WSSA0010 Warranty Feb 2029*\n\no\tEbay number 144909831937\n\no\tWatch s/n 407513\\*\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 21/01/2023\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**lhconquests**\n\n*Ex-Demo Cartier Santos Automatic Steel Large Model WSSA0009 Warranty to Nov 2027*\n\no\tEbay number 354614837767\n\no\tWatch s/n 4072138469XX\n\no\tSold on 04/03/2023\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**rwc1951**\n\n*New (Ex-Demo) Unused Cartier Santos Medium Model 35mm Steel WSSA0010 - Dec 2028*\n\no\tEbay number 255921484128\n\no\tWatch s/n 4075\\*\\*\\*\\*299XX\n\no\tSold on 15/01/2023\n\n*New (Ex-Demo) Unused Cartier Santos Large Model 40mm Steel &amp; Gold W2SA0006*\n\no\tEbay number 255997450826\n\no\tWatch s/n 4072138\\*\\*\\*XX\n\no\tSold on 05/03/2023\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**gilmours\\_timepieces**\n\n*Ex-Demo Cartier Santos Medium Model 35mm Steel Automatic Watch WSSA0010*\n\no\tEbay number 334665493560\n\no\tWatch s/n UNKNOWN\n\no\tSold on 14/12/2022\n\n*Ex-Demo Cartier Santos Medium Model 35mm Steel Automatic Watch WSSA0010*\n\no\tEbay number 334658020779\n\no\tWatch s/n UNKNOWN\n\no\tSold on 13/12/2022\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scammer also used the following username **Gowyellog**",

I don’t mind new or used. I do not mind auto or quartz.\n\n1. Sport watch with rubber straps. Kind of wanted something I could swap between black straps and red straps. Don’t mind if it comes with a metal band to swap out but also no preference. I did like solar power for this like Seiko Prospex SNE589 or Citizen Promaster Dive. Also saw Tag Aquaracer quartz used around $1000. Don’t have my heart set specifically on a dive watch but want a sporty vibe.\n\n2. Was thinking of 2 watches for leather straps. Something simple/dressy but that i can wear casual. One that I could swap black and red leather strap on (maybe a black dial) and the other for brown leather strap (maybe a beige dial). Was looking at the Hamilton jazzmaster and zodiac but want some suggestions of other brands to look into. (really like the red grand Seiko but not trying to spend that $$) \n\n3. Also have my eye on on Tissot PRX in gold, looking to see if there are any other similar style suggestions",

I own one of their models (The Night, formerly The GUN), and though I really love the look and fit more than any other watch I’ve tried, there are a couple of durability issues I’ve run into. Over 4 years, I’ve dented the 316L stainless steel case, chipped the mineral crystal face (which I replaced with sapphire crystal), caused the leather strap sides to separate from one another, and lost the dial because it snagged on a strap and launched into oblivion in an airport loading zone. However, this new collection seems to avoid most of the design choices that led to these issues.\n\nHow does the watch look on paper for $350?",

It is still the most expensive watch I’ve owned so far, but it has also become one of my most frequently worn. I just want to write down some owner’s experience for my own reference, and for anyone who’s debating whether to buy the watch. \n\nThe positives: \n\n\\-Design and style: no need to say more. Classic, timeless, rich history. Also, this should be a strap monster that can go with a variety of straps and bracelets. \n\n\\-Not plentiful of lume, but sufficient, and long-lasting. Can easily read the time in pitch black. \n\n\\-Dial size and case thickness have been the most pleasant surprise. At 42mm (my measurement is about 41mm) diameter and 13.2mm (my measurement 13mm) thickness, the watch wears quite flat on the wrist. Also, the weight of less than 140g means no issue of hindrance or weightiness.\n\n\\-While some may admire chronograph watches mainly for their subdial-packed style, I do find the chronograph to be one of the most useful functions of a watch. I use the chronograph to time a lot of daily activities: job sections, cooking, laundry, pacing exercises, driving time, and so on. The SPEEDmaster sure lives up to its name. (Just don’t keep the chronograph running all the time; only use it when necessary)\n\n\\-Sapphire crystal and see-through case back offers great views of the dial and the delicate movement. I just can’t help but take off the watch from time to time and observe the movement in operation. \n\nSome issues that I initially was concerned about but turned out less concerning: \n\n\\-No date window: Just a bit of personal preference because all other watches I own have a date window. However, there are enough instruments in daily lives that can tell the date, so I had quickly let go of this issue. \n\n\\-50m of water resistance: Another personal preference as all other watches I own have minimum of 100m WR. I’ve seen a variety of opinions on the water resistance of the Speedy. Some owners took theirs to shower, swimming, and even snorkeling without the watch showing any sign of water intrusion. Others have complained that even a couple of hours of playing in the water caused fogginess. Anyhow, 50m WR is quite enough for resisting splashes and occasional dip into water, and I don’t find this to be hugely annoying.\n\n\\-Hand-wind movement: Now this is something that needs a bit of nurturing. For the first few months I did forget to wind it form time to time and had to scramble to wind up before use. After a while the muscle memory gets built in. Just find a daily routine (bedtime, exercise, wash and brush in the morning, dress up for work, afternoon teatime etc), wind the watch, keep it up for a month or so, and you will never forget. \n\nOne issue that I find slightly upsetting:\n\nThe steel bracelet links do eat into my wrist hair, and I can feel the clip occasionally. I have to be a bit gentler than usual when taking off the watch. Also, the “sharper” edges of the links as well as the buckle clasp could cause slightly itchy feelings from time to time. This is why I am considering buying an Omega original strap (maybe Velcro or leather) to provide better wearing experience. \n\nOverall:\n\nWhile I loved the Moonwatch but there were some minor issues that kept me awake at night initially after the purchase, I only adore it even more one year after. If those minor issues are the price to pay for owning such an iconic and functional watch, I am willing to pay up. Besides, there is always the option of going the NASA-certified version with acrylic cap and sealed case back for $1,000 less.",

His conclusion was that it did kind of diminish the brand a bit in his eyes. What are your thoughts on this? If it says \"Swiss Made\" on the dial, is that good enough for you, or are you looking for something that's top to bottom a Swiss product (or as much as possible given global supply chains)?\n\nI have to admit, I don't know what to think about this because, on one hand I don't really care where a watch is from if I like it, but on the other, there's undoubtedly a premium you pay for those \"Swiss Made\" words.",

It's at their entry level pricing from my POV, but the components still have that quality that this can become my showpiece of the collection.\n\nI also need to ensure there are 500 characters so this part is just to hit that total.",

It seemed cheap at $350, but it had 9 days left, so I figured it would run up. But then the \"more like this\" row was filled with more Clubs, many sub-$100. Some looked legitimate with period correct patina (I know that can be faked), and others looked a little too new. I'm not going to put any links, because I don't want to get flagged as promotional or posting replicas. \n\nI'm wondering if anyone has ever come across this and knows the deal with these. I know the Club was JLC's 70's foray into mass production, but were they really mass produced to the extent that they're this cheap? I'm confused because the Club seems to be the entry level model, so why would it be a popular target for counterfeits? I've seen tons of fake Rolex Daytonas and Subs, but never a fake AirKing, so why would they pick this lowly model for replicas?\n\nI'm considering grabbing one, because even if they're not in the same strata as most JLCs, they're still kinda cool looking pieces of history. I just don't want to fall into the too good to be true trap. I appreciate your insight.",
