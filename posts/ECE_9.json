I design temperature and lights sensors using EAGLE that use analog electronics. While my job is low stress, I'm bored at work. And it's been like that for awhile. I'm looking at moving into a different industry. Especially because I really don't like the location I work in. I also don't make as much as I think I could. The only reason I only took this job two years ago was because my parents kicked me out of the house post-graduation and I got a job offer from them two days before my three-month sublet was going to expire and I would be homeless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to learn about battery management systems. Power electronics engineering is a growing field and it's one i've wanted to move into for awhile. However, I only have a BSEET degree, and most companies want someone with an EE degree. But I have two years of experience designing products at work (my coworkers have BSEE degrees) so maybe some employers will overlook that. To do this, I have two choices:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Go back to school for an MSEE\n\nCU Bolders offers a masters in Electrical Engineering degree that is performance-driven meaning if I can pass some catch-up courses, anyone can take the degree. Their course material covers both switching converters and battery management system design. I'll have to review some math my engineering courses never covered, but I think it's doable. This would take me two years while working full-time. It would cost me $20,000 but I can afford it assuming I keep living with my roomate and forego making retirement contributions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. Don't bother with more education and just teach myself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is by far the cheaper option and is actually how I got my first job in the first place (I designed an LED panel with different patterns programmed with an arduino MEGA). Buy some battery management systems from other companies, dissect them, and learn how they work. Then design my own BMS from the ground up with my own microcontroller and design the PCB myself. Then Show this to employers during job interviews. If I already have a base of knowledge and some design experience from working on other products, maybe some employers will overlook that, but I don't know for sure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",

On the other hand, working at NGC will I guess diversify my resume and it'll give me a chance to experience a new company and city. \n\nJust wondering what people think would be the decision in this situation.

My main question is can I use some smaller MOSFETs, smaller choke and less capacitance if I'm not planning to drive it very hard, say P240Ns instead of P260Ns or are there other parameters to keep in mind, any general ZVS tips are welcome, just to note I'm not on a budget but if I can save money why not do it.\n\nThanks in advance! üòÅ",

All I want is to have the thing boot to a very simple, minimal OS (is that the rootfs or filesystem or OS? not sure what to call the piece of linux that's loaded by the kernel) that just displays a UI that I build on my host machine.  I'm figuring I'll be doing simple stuff like talking to I2C and UART via sysfs, so the underlying code just has to do file reads and writes. I was thinking Mono since I can make the UI in xamarin easily with C# (works fine running linaro/debian, but again I want to pare that down) and I just don't like Qt. I know there are UI tools for python, but that feels very limited and maybe more overhead than mono? Anyway, I don't know what that minimal OS looks like.  Is it just the rootfs with X11? What about simple framebuffer? Can I avoid low level graphics stuff and still be able to make a UI that I cross-compile on a host machine?  Help!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS - The processor is NXP/Freescale i.mx6UL and please don't mention Yocto because it's horrible and extremely convoluted.

I should graduate sometime in 2020.\n\n# What I'm currently up to:\n\nAt work I'm really lucky to be the software quality assurance engineer/tester for the team working on the lower level embedded software aspects of our product, which means I have frequent interactions with electrical engineers and sometimes am helping troubleshoot hardware problems with Python tools I originally made for software testing. I'm learning a lot from this experience so it feels like a good spot to be in now to complement my coursework.\n\nBUT... I feel slightly out of reach from what I want to be doing, which is the actual electrical and low level software design work currently being done at my company. It's so close to me on a day to day basis that I can taste it without actually fully being able to participate since I'm just the \"tester\" on my team. On a side note, I feel I'm slowly developing an inferiority complex because these are the words of those I work with, not just mine.\n\n# Here's where I need some help:\n\nI actually already get emails from recruiters about embedded development positions because they see \"embedded systems\" in my linkedin, but I really don't have any experience yet so I don't think I can do well in the interviews. There are a lot of medical device companies and robotics companies in my area, so I feel like there are plenty of future opportunities to find work as an electrical engineer, but I feel like I have to somehow shake my identity as a tester and be seen as a fledgling electrical engineer.\n\nMy manager and the electrical engineering manager at my current job already know I want to move in this direction. My current manager is aware that when I finish my masters degree I want to be working in electrical engineering at my current company otherwise I would probably have to leave. The electrical engineering manager has thrown some bones by letting me test some new hardware, but has communicated to me that there \"isn't currently space for someone just out of school in the hardware group at this time.\"\n\nDoes anybody have advice for how I can set myself up for getting an electrical engineering position in my area after having been a software quality assurance engineer for two years already, and for at least another two years while I finish my masters degree?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

However, I have a few questions.   \n\n\n1. My resume is very sub par. The only relevant projects I can list were games that my friends and I coded during hackathons in high school and not much else. How can I build my resume up in order to get internships? I've read that research positions or individual projects help, but I have no idea where to go for both of these. \n2. Should I be applying everywhere I can get my hands on even if I don't meet some of the requirements? Also, should I be sending follow up emails to companies if I don't hear back within a few weeks? \n3. How important is GPA for the first internship? I hear from upperclassmen that GPA isn't very relevant, but I talked to some of the recruiters at my college career fair and they told me that they want a good GPA. \n\nThanks for hearing me out.",

A lot of people say you should be applying to a lot of jobs as a new grad but I have found that to be difficult. I just graduated with a Bachelor's in EE, with CompE concentration. I have a good gpa (3.59) and have gotten a few calls back and one on site interview in a week, but I still want to apply to other jobs just in case. Out of all the jobs I've applied to online I've gotten one call back, and I've applied to maybe 20 jobs. My other opportunities came from the career fair. That is kind of disappointing because my university only has two companies that I was interested in, I feel it's because our city doesnt have a lot of good companies around us and companies don't want to take the time to come over here. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see a lot of people ask on here that you should apply to a lot of companies. Some people even say apply to about 5 a day. I don't see how people can do this unless theyre applying to jobs they don't meet the credentials for. I'm an EE major with CompE concentration so I've taken mostly courses involving digital logc, FPGA, HDL and microcontroller based courses, embedded systems and C/C++. There are a lot of jobs but they ask for 2+ years of experience, which I don't have. I also see a lot of jobs that I don't have the skills for such as Controls Engineering that involves PLC &amp; HMI which I've never come across. Or Electrical Designer positions that require knowledge in Auto Cad, and jobs that involved power. I didn't take any courses that focused or went into depth on autocad, controls, or power but there seem to be a lot of opportunities in these fields.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I be applying to these positions that I don't have the knowledge or the skills theyre asking for? Did anybody start off with a job that they had no related experience in or taken related courses? And is it frowned upon to be applying to jobs that require multiple years of experience as a new grad?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The course plan of embedded systems (which i can take next year) also looks same and not interesting.\nThe thing is I don't want to come to a conclusion because of this. There is huge difference between what we study and what we do in real jobs. So it would be helpful if I know what a job of embedded engineer actually is.\n\nI like solving puzzles, maths problems. I liked digital circuits course from last semester and solved more fun problems in it out of interest, as it was similar to puzzle solving. I also got interested in signals and systems course because of the maths part in it.  Is it a good thought that digital design,vlsi,fpgas etc. will also be similar to this?? \n\nSo pretty much it would be helpful if you guys help me out with what a embedded engineer and digital design engineer would actually do  in real jobs and also other important factors of the job. \n\nThank you.",

Or is it more like each cycle carries 1 bit?\n\nAlso, bandwidth is the range over which specified frequencies will pass, so in [here](https://www.google.ca/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA551CA551&amp;biw=1574&amp;bih=828&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=BZKtW6eGF5-gjwTNrKWQDA&amp;q=bandwidth+signal&amp;oq=bandwidth+signal&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i8i30k1l7j0i24k1l2.402.2176.0.2313.16.10.0.0.0.0.352.919.0j4j0j1.5.0....0...1c.1.64.img..11.5.917...35i39k1j0i67k1.0.n8aurjHPC-s#imgrc=xVfTrXqDcDQdTM:) frequencies [-fl, +fh] will pass but how does that affect the bitrate? \n\nDoes it have to do the decrease in the amount of data rate as more devices are connected to the network? (can relate to how the speed of the internet/user decreases when the number of users connected to the network increases). Increasing the bandwidth would allow all devices to get more data rate since now the network can accommodate more connected devices without reducing the data rate/user? \n\nI am just having a hard time visualizing the relation or i'm just confusing myself.

Heres my thought process:\n\nA) Enroll in the Intelligence thread to get an understanding of the methods and code behind AI while relying on my EE degree for chip design, or;\n\nB) Choose the Systems and Architecture thread for deeper understanding of the hardware, hoping to understand what I need to about AI later‚Ñ¢\n\nC) Switch to CompE, which would allow me to inherently focus more on architecture while also taking one or two CS classes based in AI\n\n\nWhat would be most beneficial in your experience? Any advice greatly appreciated!",

Now I  have 2 choices either do the job part time at a MAXIMUM of 10 Hours a  week or Full-Time.\n\nThe  university has to get me approved by some higher education board before  I can work full time so, this approval takes at least a month so But  choosing full time means I have to commit to the job for a long time  lets say at least a year.\n\nI  have applied to a lot of positions and taking the full time position  will mean that I might not be able to do those If I get accepted. The  lab/teaching assistant job will surely be great if I am pushing for a  career in academia.\n\nSo  what do you guys think should I do the job full-time prepare for a  masters and then leave in a year or 2 or should I keep working for  meager pay as part-time until I get a proper opportunity?.",

        "text": "So right out of high school, my main objectives were to move out of my parents' house by any means necessary, and see if I could find my niche somewhere between my fascination with engineering and math, and my experience with music instilled by my classical musician parents. I ended up getting a nearly full-ride scholarship to an audio engineering program at an acclaimed school, and at first I had a great time and was learning a lot about the operations of studios and the technology they used. However, after the first few months of seriously getting into my program, I found myself at odds with the general attitudes of the recording industry, and also felt like I was not being challenged very much in school. I had expected audio engineering to be a lot more like engineering than it actually is. Since I wasn't being challenged, I threw my restless energy towards studying calculus and elements of circuit design on my own, since those subjects have always fascinated me. Thanks to this, I've been able to repair my friends' electronic devices and work on building my own. After studying independently for most of my time at university, I've come to realize that though it's been great to make connections here, I'd be much better off studying EE, and since I'm at a music school, it will have to be somewhere else. This has been exceedingly difficult for me to figure out since I won't have any financial support from my family to pay for school, and I am not too familiar with the process of transferring from one school to another. I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience in transitioning from a different subject, or if you had good recommendations for how to build knowledge and skills outside of school. Reading books by yourself only gets you so far. \n\nThank you in advance!",

Though I have received over 10 phone interviews and 2 onsites over a span of &gt;4 months, and in most of the cases they ended up taking someone with more experience. \n\nI am mainly targetting embedded/hardware jobs. Anything related to firmware (not OS related), pcb design is what I think I enjoy doing the most though I still don't consider myself an expert. Most of the hands on embedded stuff I learned was outside of school. \n\nThe only experience I have is a research position I undertook last year but that wasn't too great either in the sense I was the only one working on something that I never really did before but certainly was a huge learning curve. The entire project was about implementing sensor fusion algorithms in C++, interface with the IMU and be able to model an object's orientation, but I only got done with the implementation part. I ran the code and it seemed to give the expected output but that's about it. The main issue was I kept running out of memory and I optimized to the point I could. \nSo if the employer asks me to tell him about this research, I am afraid I might only be able to tell simple stuff.\n\n[Here's my resume](https://www.docdroid.net/uAUMqQi/anonymous-resume-5.pdf). I got some advice to change my resume template because it looks \"all over the place\" but I couldn't find any template that lets me fit everything within a page. For the research part, I don't know what else to write because that seems bland in the sense it doesn't follow STAR technique. \n\nAny suggestion is more than welcome!\n\n",

The only required peripherals are a few GPIO, UART, and timers.\n\nCurrently I am leaning towards a PIC18F97J60 since it has an integrated PHY which will simplify board layout/cost considerably, Microchip has a free TCP/IP stack available for it, and a cheap dev board is available for prototyping.

As an international student, I am unable to even apply for these jobs and I feel a bit demoralized about the whole job application process.\n\nMy ideal position would be as a computer/embedded systems engineer at a medical device company (I am very interested in healthcare/medicine), but I know that jobs in this field are sparse, relatively speaking. I am willing to relocate anywhere and I don't mind about the size of the company as long as I'm in a place where I can learn and continue to grow as a practicing engineer.\n\nAre there any particular tips you guys have for international students trying to land an ECE/Embedded Systems/Signal Processing job? Any particular industries I should be looking into? Are there any particular cities or companies that are willing to take in students with my background?\n\nSidenote: STEM international students are able to work up to about 3 years without any particular type of sponsorship (OPT under the F-1 student Visa). I intend to make use of those 3 years to gain valuable experience at a company here in the US. I know that many companies don't really want to hire international students because of all the visa sponsorship stuff, but I wouldn't need one until my OPT runs out.\n\nThank you all in advance!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Also curious what kind of amperage this will set up will draw from my power source. Any help is extremely appreciated!!!",

        "text": "**TL;DR**\n\nI'm reading up on the RISC-V specs, but I'm not sure how to implement the hardware. And I have no idea at all how to load software onto it.\n\n**\\TL;DR**\n\nI'm reading the RISC-V user-level ISA spec sheet, as well as Patterson's [book](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/0999249118/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) providing an overview of how the instruction set works.\n\nThere are a few things that I don't quite get about the ISA itself just yet, but that's not the point of this post.\n\nThe point of this post is that I don't know how to do, well, *everything else*.\n\nFor starters, are there any guidelines for how to implement the rest of the processor? The ISA spec basically tells me only how to decode the instructions and prepare them for execution, if I'm not mistaken. That leaves things like pipeline depth, branch prediction, caching, the actual execution hardware, and the overall hardware layout up to the designer, right? In which case, are there any guidelines as to how I should set those things up? I suppose I can compare results after running some benchmark, but that kinda leads me to a further problem when it comes to loading a program.\n\nLet's say I successfully write up a synthesizable VHDL model of the core and I want to load the bitstream onto my Arty S7 FPGA board. First of all, for instruction and data memory, I want to use the off-chip DDR3L RAM instead of the block RAM, right? Would the IP block RAM be suitable for a cache, or do I want to use flip-flops? Or both, with different hardware for L1 and L2 caches?\n\nThen comes the challenge of loading a program to run on the core. I suppose I can fumble my way through writing a crude assembler program or script to translate assembly instructions into binary lines. And then, I guess I need some kind of program loader logic on my board (which may be available as an IP core) to interface between the UART and the DDR3L. And then I can use a terminal program to stream the binaries to the UART to load the program memory.\n\nBut what if I want to compile C code to target the RISC-V platform? I don't know anything about toolchains. I've only ever programmed microcontrollers in integrated development environments; I know how to write code and click \"compile\" and \"run\". I don't really understand anything about GCC or Make or anything like that. Are there options to do that sort of stuff on a Windows machine, or is it all Linux stuff? Should I look for an Eclipse or Visual Studio plugin to fill my needs?\n\nFinally, there should be programs to translate from HDL code to a  VLSI layout, right? I downloaded Glade and I have poked around it a little bit, but I have little idea as to the extent of what I can do with it. Is there some way to translate the HDL code to a netlist, and then have Glade automatically generate a silicon layout from that for a given CMOS process technology using a given library of standard cells?\n\nTo anyone smarter than me, thanks for indulging me with your time.",
