We have a public wiki where anyone with a login can edit, so we patrol pages. The problem with the CSV upload is that all the pages are getting marked as unpatrolled.   \n\n\nIs there a way to upload CSV files to create pages without it marking as \" This edit has not yet been patrolled?\" If not, is there a quick way to get all of these uploads transferred to patrolled without clicking in to each page? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",
