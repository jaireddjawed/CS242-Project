Not just that, but they're being \"polite\" when in reality they hate me. When I'm stressed and anxious these paranoid thoughts become more severe. I feel like I'm such a repellent to people, they're practically running away.\n\nI don't think there's any reason they might be like that... I mean, I'm an ordinary person... I've always had low self-confidence. Even my own mother doesn't like me. She oftenlly ignored me and rarely ever cared about anything I had to say. And she's always super critical of me and negative when she's with me like everything is wrong in the world.\n\nThe same with my older brother and many others. They hated me and picked on me for no reason. To this day, everyone is the same with me and I don't know what to do.",

        "text": "Hey fellow \"socialskills\" members. I just had a lightbulb moment after about a year, so I am posting this because out of the 3 million people in this group, I figured if I can help one person, that would be a success. \n\nJust a little background about me. I have struggled with social skills for the vast majority of my life, and have always had trouble making friends. To use a little bit of context, I cannot use Snapchat (like incapable) because I absolutely despise small talk hahahaha. \n\nI would drive home on the weekend and work because I had very few connections on my college campus. I could leave without a trace and nobody would miss me.\n\nWith that being said, someone (we'll call him Mark). Mark was the exactly opposite of me at the time. I spent a long time trying to be just like Mark. I changed myself so much that I fell into a very deep sadness. So much so that I went to see my psychiatrist after about three or four years. I was an emotional wreck. In fact, sometimes I still am, but it is improving now.\n\nNow to the lightbulb moment:\n\nAs socially awkward individuals, we very commonly attach ourselves to people that we see as \"superior\", or more \"socially accepted\". Although it is important to use them as a role model in social situations, I made the mistake of trying to change my personality to someone that I was not. I can remember straight up that I told Mark that my favorite Beer is \"Bud Light\" because I was too ashamed to admit that I was 19 years old and had never drank before. Someone can be the nicest person in the world, but if they cannot accept you for who ***YOU ARE***, then they are not worth your time. \n\nI also lived alone, so I had nothing to do all day but try to morph into another person. If I would have never met Mark, there is a good chance that I would not have improved as a person.\n\nNow I understand that is much easier than done, and I am still trying to wrap my hands around this concept. It really is a day by day process. \n\nTL;DR: We as humans love to play pretend and try to turn ourselves into others that have seemingly better lives than we do, but it is important to take our own personalities into perspective and don't give ourselves up for likes. Trust me, it doesn't go well!\n\nGod Bless, everyone!",

So I have a friend who is very funny on the outside, always laughing and making jokes, he is also very funny and all right. But the problem is he is actually very suicidal. I think he had a bit of depression in him always but it increased even more when he get rejected by a girl. He is talking about depression and suicide sometimes when we are alone. And I know he only talks to me about it because he feels more comfortable when he is talking with me. When he talks to me about these things I generally try to shake him and say things like \"don't worry about it too much\" or \"You can't quit\" etc. I never had a friend like this so I am not very experienced what to say or do, I simply try to encourage him but he is convinced himself that he is a loser, depressed guy or something. His beliefs to himself is terrible and I don't know how to fix him to no commit suicide or become more depressed. I would be really glad if someone could help me what to do or what to say in this situation. He is only talking to me about these things so I really feel like I gotta do something.",

I'm guessing this is widely considered normal?  \n\n\nI just found it funny that my hesitancy was me playing it safe yet others that are active socially do not see it that way. It's as though they don't even have that component in their brain of \"What if this many messages annoys someone?\". They don't annoy me, btw, just found it interesting.",

One of the ways is that some colleagues just ask for free knowledge and save their time. Or they will come and start talking of their problem. I will ask a question or so and it solves the problwm. Once in a while it's ok but it's not my responsibility to train them or mentor them. In recent incident, a colleague was stuck in something for a few hours and then came to me and started talking about the problem. My response was to ask them if 2 things where done and it immediately solved their problem. These aren't like a 'ducky chat' things. My questions are usually specific to technical knowledge which comes after lots of hours of work. After their problem was solved there was no mention of me in front of our supervisor. \n\nHow do I change my natural helping response and put some filter there.",

I have lost the last of my friendships during the pandemic, and now I've been alone for a couple of years so I'm freaking out.\n\nI have unsupportive flatmates and a warm but distant relationship with most family members: some of them are very close as in opening your heart and calling them in times of need, but they are relatives, I want friends who have no business with me and freely chose to be close to me. I also had a trouble with previous friends who didn't share and open up as much as me, I'm really looking for reciprocity. However, even those friends were real, meaning that we shared interests and humour as our real selves. With my flatmates I have been criticised for liking to go to dance classes (\"it's like being a teenager, you are too old\") so it's not likely that I will share anything of myself after many episodes like that one.\n\nMy mother keep saying that I should be self sufficient and do not come from a place of need when looking for friends, but I don't want to die earlier than I have to and I keep thinking that we are a social species. I am an introvert so I look for few quality cherished friends, the whole \"social group\" lifestyle is very draining and shallow for me.\n\nI have made that mistake of trying to \"close in\" with people because I need friends, a bit like an over enthusiast puppy, and got burned as a result. The truth is that I dearly miss the daily sharing of a link about a niche interest with a \"look at that!!\" message, it was very important to be able to be understood like this.\n\nShould I wait and have no friends until I don't need them to avoid codependency, or what?",

I think my attitude was a lot more pleasant to be around; I feel that non-depressed people don't want to really be around people dealing with depression, as I've been told by people I hung out with that they felt \"unwanted\" around me.  I guess it's the vibes that I give off after becoming depressed, even when I do want to be around others? I don't say anything that indicates that's how I feel, I just try to be social and laugh but the energy is just not there when I get in those depressive moods.\n\nIs it best to wait until the depression is significantly better before trying to meet new people, even though I feel like I'm ready to make that step?

Not everyone does this, but I've noticed people who were teased a lot when younger (and still are) may fall into the trap of thinking everyone is against them. This results in either a sour demeanor towards others or compensating with illusions of being better than everyone else or thinking others are the problem. There are likely more ways this manifests. But it boils down to a fear of being ridiculed for who you are. And these are the ways we cope with this irrationality, by closing ourselves off to others. If you don't give someone else a chance to get to know you, most people won't bother. And actually will ridicule you, ironically. See a cycle here?\n\n&gt;Learning to be vulnerable doesn't mean throwing all caution to the wind socially, but rather not being afraid to be yourself, show others your self and opening up to the idea that not everyone is against you.\n\n&gt;I would always worry people at work were constantly trying to find ways to make fun of me behind my back. No one really liked me because I didn't give anyone the chance. When I finally said fuck it, if they make fun of me they make fun of me, I started making closer connections and some really good friends.",

Everything was very smooth and nothing was one-sided. When we took different classes,  I was afraid that we won't talk as much but we found a way to call by the end of each week. Now, I have been making new friendships with people so that I don't cling to that one friend and have company during lunchtime. I started to feel like I am ignoring her or choosing to meet new people over talking to her. And she has a lot of friends unlike me, so I kind of started feeling like I would lose her to those other friends.  Since I am kinda slow and awkward, my coping mechanism is usually to isolate and distance myself in order not to be disappointed. I am not that good at small talk at school, so sometimes I just can't figure out what to say plus we are both good listeners. So it makes sense that we won't talk each class or every time because it is easier to lend an ear than to initiate a random convo. That is why she is around her extroverted friends more because it makes sense to just be there around those people who can spontaneously talk about anything. Eventually, I kinda feel like I suck. And I am afraid that I am ruining our friendship. How can I feel better about this?",

I don’t know if it’s in my head or if it’s something that is actually happening. We will sometimes talk on discord one on one once in a while. My internet dropped immediately after she was teasing me about something and she was frantic thinking I was upset and left. I just can’t help but feel like we aren’t as close as we were. And I just feel like we aren’t as close as the other people around us. We are in a friend group and i can’t help but feel like after this new person joined the group they are kinda pushing me aside and we aren’t as close as we used to be. Part of it is that I’m worried about losing my friend because I wouldn’t have anyone else. I see how they treat everyone else and it’s not the same as they treat me.",

Possibly due to life experiences and maturity, we become less open and vulnerable into wanting or building 'real' genuine connections, most of us have acquaintances more so than real friends.

The entire issue has arisen because the way I speak can come off as aggressive. I've asked if it's due to my crass language, but what it seems to be moreso is me being very passionate when I speak. I'm not sure if it's because of \"mansplaining\" because my female friend did say that I mansplain to other men too, it's not a targeted gender expression.\n\nThis problem is exasperated when I'm drunk on occasion (once every two weeks or so, with friends) where I can come off a bit rude / dominating. I don't want to be this way and I am looking to make a change.\n\nIn sum, any advice?",

        "text": "So, a bit of backstory: We're all teens. I'm 15, my friend is 14, and she is 14. Let's call my friend (J), and the girl (F).\n\nJust a few days ago, J out of the blue DMed me asking what I would do if someone in our classroom had a crush on me. I told him, \"I'd tell them that I'm a huge fucking disappointment and that their taste is absolutely horrible\" and I asked him what's up with it.\n\nA little story about J: J has been my friend since kindergarten (10 years). We were never really THAT close, but we enjoyed talking to each other in class. J is also close friends with F.\n\nAbout F, I guess she and I got along? I guess? We mostly talk both to each other in English, but I rarely talk to her. Most of the times we've chatted were during the quarantine and at 5th grade.\n\nHe then told me that someone DID have a crush on me, which I doubted. I never really believed that anyone would like me. Maybe it's my non-existent self-esteem or whatever, but I've never seen myself in a positive light. I don't think a girl had a crush on me before, either.\n\nReasons why I'm never proud of how I look is that I was called ugly multiple times as a child. I was compared by looks by my relatives to my brother, who looks really handsome. I guess it's fair to say that I look better now compared to before, I guess? I exercise and take care of myself. (Which is rare because this country is relatively unhealthy)\n\nI remember 4 years ago, the same situation happened. My \"friend\" (he was just beneficial) lied to me that a girl liked me, and of course, I doubted him as usual, but I slowly began to think that I was actually loveable. This improved my mood until he told me that he was just joking and she never even liked me as a friend. I tried so hard to hide my tears that day. \n\n Well, thanks to that experience, I developed a \"safety mechanism\" for myself. I doubt people who compliment me. I am ugly; that's it. \n\nBut anyway, what do you guys think? Should I just doubt him?",

        "text": "I have a coworker, we will call her Linda, who I absolutely adore. Linda is obese and often makes jokes about her weight, but I can tell certain situations are uncomfortable for her. I strive to treat Linda equitably and try to anticipate her needs - For example, I wait with her if she needs to stop on a hill when we are walking outside, and my coworkers and I make sure that there are chairs without arms for her to sit in at events &amp; meetings. (She never asks for special treatment and always thanks me profusely for waiting with her, and I always say that's what friends do!)\n\nHowever, I'm really struggling with how to make her comfortable in social settings. We went to a movie together once - The theatre had Dreamloungers, which are larger chairs, but I could tell the armrest between us was squeezing her. I offered to put it up and she immediately said \"No, I don't want my fat touching you.\" I respected her wishes but I said \"Linda, I want you to be comfortable.\" (I then thought about how maybe I could have bought 3 seats so we still could have sat next to each other and she would have had her own room without the armrest.) The movie was so fun, but it really bothered me that she was uncomfortable.\n\nFast forward to today: I invited several coworkers, including Linda, to a one-woman musical that I'm super excited about at a small theatre, plus lunch. I sent personal texts and not a group message. Everyone said yes, except Linda, who said \"Thank you but I will pass.\" I told my partner that I was bummed she said no and he replied, \"Babe, she probably can't fit in the theatre seats and doesn't want to tell you that.\" So I texted if she'd like to join us just for lunch, she was totally welcome to, and tried to laugh it off that I knew not everyone was a musical theatre nerd like me. She said she'd love to join for lunch and said that she did enjoy theatre but honestly, she knew she couldn't fit in the seats. :(\n\nI called the old director of the theatre and she said they could add a chair for Linda on an end cap and that it would be no problem, but I don't want Linda to feel singled out or embarrassed. I was thinking maybe I would visit the theatre to see the setup, and then offer the accessible seating to Linda if she wants it.\n\nHow would you approach this situation? Linda is very social and very fun, and I think she would go if the seats weren't a barrier. Would it be socially acceptable for me to research the accessible options for her and chat with her about it privately? I really want to get this right.\n\nThank you for any advice.",

It sounds fucked up but if someone's like a typical \"not popular in highschool\" more introverted, non dominant type of person I don't get those nerves as when someone is either very outgoing or someone I consider extremely friendly, good natured, or cool. Like people who just have good ass character and treat me well regardless of how I come across (and are always friendly) make me have a nervous reflexive reaction because I feel obligated to make them like me and cast a good impression. If someone's a super outgoing situationally dominant (basically opposite of me) I get nervous because of I guess the same reason. I know alpha and beta are stupid terms but I'm so tired of feeling beta bro like fuck 😂😂 \n\nGirls make me nervous but not even as much as certain dudes. Like when I'm talking to a girl, idk, I find it easier to be good natured and charismatic. Even if its a girl I'm interested in. I've been seeing this one girl a lot, she took my virginity, closest thing I've had to a real relationship and we're getting closer. When I'm with her I am so goofy and in tune with myself and what I find funny. I make her laugh and myself laugh. I find that shit impossible with almost everyone else but ESPECIALLY other dudes.\n\nI want to fix this. The only thing I can come up with is put myself out there and actually try to be social from now on like most people do because I've completely ceased making an effort for some reason. I've noticed that being funny and social isn't as effortless for everyone else as I thought and requires actually focusing on being liked/charismatic/funny or whatever, because if they weren't trying they'd just be completely silent like me. The only difference is there's no self consciousness and self negativity in their trying- they just do it without over analyzing. I do it and think about how stupid what I just said was for 15 minutes after, completely silent and contemplative looking as I torture myself while everyone else is just bouncing back and forth😂😂😂",

School was the only place where I'd get to be around other people, covid happened and made things worse. I missed out on a good chunk of high school cause of it.  And in 2022 I graduated high school.  \n\nSince then I've spent the past 8 months alone in my room. I know it's pathetic but I have a very unhealthy relationship with the internet. But it's all I have. My parents don't really talk to me or care that I've spent so long indoors. One of them is always screaming and it's hard to talk to about any problems I'm having. The other is tired, sick a lot of the time, and getting old. My friends are gone. I don't even really talk to people or have any friends online. I don't have a car. I've never had a job. I'm not in college. I've gone outside maybe *3 times* in the last 8 months. I've just now started to pick myself back up after being alone and depressed for 8 months.\n\n I feel like I've missed out on a lot of opportunities because I was scared of getting hurt. I would purposefully avoid social situations and isolated myself because I was scared, now I'm kind of paying for that.\n\nI want to get out there, get a job, go to college but I'm afraid of being around other people. I read the news and get scared of the outside world. The world just seems so overwhelming nowadays. Being isolated for so long has messed up a lot of my thinking and social skills. I want to enjoy life and not be scared of it. But I always imagine the worst. I just don't want to do that anymore.\n\nTherapy is *not* an option but I'm trying out these therapy youtube videos.",

I dont know how to get this feeling out of my head or how to find friends that has familiar mindset as me. For some other info: i am 18f and I play pc games a lot. I dont go to clubs in my town because they are way to sketchy and people in my school are just way different than I am. I would love to make new contacts but I just dont know how or where.",

        "text": "There are these two friends that I like being around. One we are really cool, but the other one not as much. But I still think we are cool. Also, I want to prefece this by saying that I know both of them for slightly less than a year. BUT I truly do cherish them since they help me forget certain things. \n\nI recently started therapy and meds after an incident occurred and was diagnosed with severe social anxiety. Prior to therapy, I was told by one of my friends I can be arrogant and over-confident. I would try to act cool and ignore what they say. However, inside, I was crying and often times would cry to myself. Now I have realized why people have a different perception of me and it's honestly because I really don't know how to talk to people. \n\nI have already had 8 sessions. I won't go too in depth about what the session was about, but I was tasked by my therapist to tell them how I feel since I always have a fear people think negative things about me. One of them I am comfortable to talk with face to face. The other...I am genuinely scared. I think the reason I am mostly scared is because when I text him to be sure he is okay, he never texts back. However, I also understand because he is going through a lot right now. BUT he also texts my other friend so who knows. Also, when we recently saw each other face to face, he looked unhappy to see me (or so I think). Though, with the way I acted before, I am not surprised. Also, there was a time he jokingly said he wouldn't be my friend if it wasn't for a mutual friend. I also agreed jokingly thinking it maybe a joke, but honestly I did take it to heart. \n\nHowever, despite this, I really do want to be his friend. He is a funny, kind-hearted, and smart person. It would be an honor and pleasure to be his friend. I may not be a good friend to him in his eyes, but I still at least want to talk with him briefly and be like, I do like you and I would like to be a better friend. However, I would of course ask if he feels the same and if he doesn't then I would respect him and give him distance. I would feel hurt, but I would also feel a sense of relief since I know the truth now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess this comes to my question. Is it worth talking to this person? I know he is going through a lot and I don't want to mess with his life right now since he is going through a lot. I am worried and scared I may cause some emotional damage or he may think that I am being confrontational. I don't want to be. I dont want to hurt him.",

Should I text her and ask if she's still up for dinner and give her an out in case she's tired (it was a long day of flights)?
