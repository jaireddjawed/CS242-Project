        "text": "(Sorry about the title. Meant cousin's wife)To be brief, me and my Nmother were evicted in September and her cousin(male) let us move in. His wife is unfortunately one of those loud, aggro old ladies, which was a small reason why my Nmother moved out on her own in December 2015. Anyway... I started going to a city clinic in April and have since been diagnosed with depression and PTSD(Fortunately, I was given daily medication on my first appointment; bupropion). Since December, cousin and his wife have had a rocky relationship, but his wife has been aggro with me when I've done something wrong or she suspects something is \"suspicious\"; she also doesn't like that I'm paying my phone bill and a storage bill and can't afford to always help on utilities. Like today, she vented to me about why I wrote my name on a bag of chicken in the freezer, and when I explained it's because there's not a lot of food in the house, she said she doesn't think it's right for me to buy for myself(she doesn't like the type of chicken I bought), thinking that I'm being /sneaky/ in doing this. Throw in the fact that I have big social issues bordering on anxiety thanks to my mom and you get a nervous wreck who freezes up, endures the nagging, and compromises by declaring everyone can have it. Now, it's made me avoidant of buying food for myself because I know she's always going to think it's not fair for everyone. Then, she said how my cousin told her recently not to be mean to me because a lot happened to me, and what's she say? 'SHE'S been through a lot? I'VE been through a lot and look at me. I prayed and talked to the pastor and friends and got better. I stand up for myself' and that her father tried to assault her as a kid. I'm not one to say whose trauma is worse, but to use it to make someone else's struggle seem not as bad and should be overcome right now? This intimidated me as my mother used to silverline everything I got anxiety over. Telling her I have social issues I'm trying to fix did nothing. I haven't given her any details of my past either and now I never will.\n\nNot to mention I've developed heart problems and very low white blood cell count from a lack of appetite(nearly blacking out at work and going to the ER for the first time ever). I threw away what I cooked after she vented at me and took antihistamines to calm down when I got to my room. Was on the verge of tears and an anxiety attack despite my medication.  Probably not going to store food here anymore..",

        "text": "warning: strong language down below\n\nGoodness. What a 24 hours I've had. I just want a place to vent and share my frustrations. I know this post is not primarily regarding abuse by my N-Mom (but don't worry, it's in there!) but it's all one big fucking clusterfuck anyways, so mods please remove me if you want.\n\nTo set the scene; I live with my husband, a few towns over from my N-mom and codependent father. I see them every few weeks - a casual dinner here or there, holidays. Been considering NC for quite some time. I may be ready now.\n\nLast night, I received a text from N-mom asking if I wanted to go out on a boat for father's day. Now, let's forget the fact that *my husband just broke his fucking ankle* and a goddamn boat isn't the best place for someone who just had surgery. We have never, ever EVER done anything for father's day except eat dinner together. In all my 30 years. Now, a week after my husband has surgery on his ankle which he needs to WALK, you want to go on a boat??? I expressed my concerns. My mom immediately says \"well you don't have to go\". I said, I didn't say that, I want to go, I'm just worried it might not be the best thing for my husband. she responds again \"its okay if you don't want to come, whatever you think is best. its just a pontoon boat, he can just sit\" and I ultimately agreed. She says \"text your dad for the details\".\n\nSo I text my dad, \"where are we going out on a boat?\" he responds \"xy lake. we're leaving at 6:30AM\". Now, my dad is a bit if a joker, and he KNOWS I hate getting up early. So, I thought he was kidding. I played along saying \"what are you insane?!\" and I thought we were joking back and forth. I get a response:\n\n\"Don't go\"\n\nAt this point I suspect I may have misunderstood the convo and say \"what, are you serious? why so early\" conversationally. I get another response:\n\n\"don't go\"\n\nI am very confused by now. I say that I'm confused, I thought he was joking, etc. I get a third response:\n\n\"Just don't go then. I won't be offended\"\n\nHe has completely ignored what I was trying to ask him, entirely stonewalled me. I am super confused, and now very concerned that this devolved so rapidly. I try to explain again. I get told to \"stop complaining\" and that \"he has a reason it's so early but he doesn't owe me an explanation and won't tell me\". He just *won't*. I'm speechless. I send one more text reiterating that I am confused, I thought he was joking, and I don't understand why he is being so weird and secretive. No response. \n\nAt this point I was hysterically crying. what I thought was a pleasant conversation turned into ... this abhorrent confrontation. I had just gotten back from therapy before this confrontation w my dad, it was a very hard session, and then when I got home the husband told me he \"needed his passport by tomorrow\" and so I had to tear the house apart and find it - I was so utterly scattered that I forgot entirely where I put it. (Spoiler: I found it)\n\nSo today, I look like hell. I'm 100% sure that everyone can tell I cried for hours and hours. In fact, the old bitchface down the cube row came and asked \"if I was okay\" and told me how bad I looked - thanks bitch. Silver lining is my boss also came to see how I was bc I called off the day before (too depressed - nice mood to go into this bullshit with) and I'm sure I sold it lol.\n\nI get a text from my mom around mid-day. \"Are you not coming bc its too early\". I text back, generally - no, it's bc of dad's behavior, I was joking, he got offended, rude, etc and I don't want to be treated like that. Then I get a flood of messages from my mom about how we \"are a family and have to stick together\" and \"I should forgive him\" and \"we need to talk things out and share feelings\" and \"you and husband don't care about us\" and \"you don't have time for us\". She harangues me and tells me that the reason my dad got mad is because I don't consider them and if I did maybe he would have given me the benefit of the doubt. \n\nUM EXCUSE ME? MAYBE if *I* was nicer then he'd be nicer? Jesus f-ing christ. I cannot believe the levels of manipulation going on here. When the fuck has this bitch ever said a goddamn word about \"love\" and \"acceptance\" and \"forgiveness\". seriously? And what, is my dad such a fucking cuck that he can't fucking fight his own battles, he sends his fucking bitch-ass narcissistic wife to do his dirty work? Fuck that shit.\n\nI am so fucking tempted to just say, you know what, fine. You want to talk it out? Let's talk it out bitch. Let me tell you how much you fucked me up, let me tell you what a fucking narcissistic bitch you are, let me tell you how abusive and disgusting of a mother you are. And my father - equally as disgusting. Grow the fuck up. Can't stand when your daughter, 30 years your junior, has a problem with your behavior? Can someone tell me why the fuck I have to be the adult in the goddamn situation?\n\nI just didn't respond. It's not worth it. Frankly this is not her battle and there's nothing that I have to say to her. She's so fucking two-faced, it boils my blood. It actually amuses me too, I can see more clearly now. My mom is J (Nex)- they are one in the same. They twist and they manipulate and they use. \n\nThank you anyone who listened :)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It's ridiculous. \n\nI've discovered something that works well for my dynamic, and hopefully it will help others too. \n\nInstead of Going \"No Contact\" I've gone \"No Apologies\".  \n\nI've decided to keep members of my Nfamily in my life, but have let them know hat I will not accept apologies for abusive behavior. So far it's worked well. The first time I practiced it though was in the heat of one of their rages. They tried to apologize while still dominating, and what I said, that is now my stock reply to phony apologies for recurring abusive behavior, was \"I do not accept, need, or want your apology\". This initially enraged the family member even more, screaming at me \"you'll never get an apology ever again!\" \n\nFor me, it allows me to retain my dignity. Raging and verbally abusing someone is basically a violation of basic social contract, subsequent apologies and the expectation that the apology will be accepted is abuse of that social contract, and acknowledging the apology  gives them permission to continue the behavior. \n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "TL;dr : My parents have just been terrible to me; through childhood, until I went NC with them. I was hit with a sense of finality recently...wondered for a bit if I have been childish. I'm so much happier though, I really don't want to go back! What was it like for you? \n\nI've felt so good, and stress free since I went NC with my parents almost two years ago. The answer I give people when they ask me why I am estranged with my parents, is that they disapproved of my husband... that they wanted me to have an arranged marriage with some random guy they chose for me. Because you see, the real answer is much too long, and far too complicated... If it had just been the disapproval, I would have never initiated the NC. It was more... it was a lifetime of never being good enough, no matter what I did. I was always too ugly, too lazy, too stupid, too underachieving, and too much of a failure.\n\nSince I went NC, I have these memories of incidences that just pop into my mind, that make me go 'WTF!!! Why would you do that to me... what were you thinking?' I feel powerless when I think of these though, because other than my husband, there's really no one who *gets* why these seemingly trivial things would be enough to end a relationship with my parents. I mean, by themselves they weren't enough, but just everything I remember, coupled with their behavior towards me now... just... is shocking.\n\n\nFor example, there was this time when I was about 9, that my mother took me to Haw per villa in Singapore. They have an attraction there, where they have portrayed the 7 levels of hell, and all that happens there... so you walk through this cave, where you see these devil figurines pulling all sorts of torture on mortal figurines. My mother had me convinced that at least some of it (frying in hot oil) if not all, would happen to me after I died. I was bawling by the time we reached the end... apparently, she thought it was a joke, because that night, she laughed about it with my dad and older sister about how she 'got me'. \n\nI was a good kid... did well in school, was a school prefect, helped out in the school library after hours, was part of the girl guides (we called them brownies). I didn't have any behavioral problems, and can't for the life of me imagine why she thought it was okay to pull something like that on me... you see, I wet my bed most nights till I was 13. \n\nThere was also this time when I was 15, that my mother started talking about putting me in the Singapore army. They have a policy where all able males above 18 are required to serve for a period of time... and despite me being female, and how opposed I was to joining, she told me I had no say in the matter.  \n\nShe told me about the experiences of her friends son, who'd joined the army. About how they would strip the recruits, and make them exercise naked, all the while caning them on their buttocks and balls. My mother would routinely sit me down and tell me that, that kind of treatment would be good for someone like me. \n\nWhy?!? I was doing well in school... I was sectional leader, and assistant quartermaster in my school band, I also played the keyboard, and I was on my school debating team. \n \n\nAnyway, I have memories of so much more than this, from both my parents... and well, I guess the reason I'm writing this down, is to do one final check on whether I have been childish in going NC with them. \n\nI talked to my husband about this last night, and he told me that while he can't tell me if I've made the right decision, he says that from everything I've told him, my parents sounds pretty abusive. He tells me about how utterly anxious and stressed I used to be before I went NC with them... and how much happier I am now. \n\n\nFor me, the straw that broke the camel's back was a year or so before I went NC. I was in grad school, and would have to call my mother every weekend. And during every call she'd lament about what a huge failure I was... about how all of my cousins had become engineers, whereas I was still stuck doing some shit research in biology. She'd routinely ask me to give it up, because I was too stupid for this, and was taking so long... that I could still make something of myself... \n\nI was already stressed about my research by then. I'd put up with her laments of me being a huge failure all through the 4 years of college, and believed that it would stop when I graduated college. It didn't. And at that point I couldn't take it anymore... I went NC, and hauled ass to therapy. \n\nIf you've made it this far though, I'd love to hear from you, and your reasons for going NC. I just hope I've not been childish in making this decision. ",

So since February I am nomadic, sort of because I need my meds so every couple of months I visit my doctor in my mother's country.\n\nBefore I left I dreamed about moving to certain area for two years because it made sense. After some traveling I arrived to that particular area and I am not sure about anything. I am questioning everything, from my ability to live in cities because they are loud to the idea of settling down.\n\nI am realizing that the idea that I will settle somewhere and won't be able to leave for yet another 12 or so years terrifies me. \n\nI am not even trying to talk to people about it because it often ends up with 'culture shock, big deal' (when talking why I don't feel comfortable in my passport country) or 'what are you running from?' (Neither belonging nor fitting in with my family there or people from my passport country, most of my family with whom I talk occasionally don't  live there, also xenophobia against perceived foreignness).",

Last week I was contacted by a guy who seemed somewhat promising.  We talked on the phone, he was generous with his compliments, but he also dominated the conversation (ugh).  He did, however, express awareness of it and said he was nervous, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  We arranged to go on a date the next night.  \n\nHe started texting me at 7:30 the next morning, because he was so excited about the date.  I responded in an appropriate manner but was a little annoyed and was wondering if he realized that this was a little weird.  Then he tried “jokingly” telling me what to wear (he LOL’d but then repeated that he wanted me to wear what he suggested), and the alarm bells went off in my head.  What guy in his right mind tries to tell a woman what to wear, EVER, let alone someone he’s never met?  I pushed back (politely) and told him I would not be wearing what he suggested, that I would be presentable, and to not text me again unless he needed to cancel (and I was really wanting to cancel but couldn't quite bring myself to do it yet).  He replied that it seemed I had issues with men, and he would cancel the date because he was looking for someone who was fun and spontaneous, and gee, he hoped I wasn’t upset.  I replied that I was not, that it was a great idea.  \n\nI’ve summarized considerably, but this is the gist.  \n\nI saved the text conversation so in the future if I forget all the crazy and I’m kicking myself for not trying harder, I can read the transcript and know I did the right thing.  I have also been reminding myself frequently that I am grateful to him for showing me his crazy so soon, before we even met!  (The Nex hid his crazy for two years; he didn’t unleash it until after we got married.) \n",

I bought a train ticket but then the baby came early.

This is right, isn't it? It wouldn't be tactful to say, I bought a ticket to come, can I stay at your house?

        "text": "Long story short, I had a breakdown when I was 23 due to persistent and intensifying abuse from my NP and have now recovered now that I am 28. I am looking to finish my degree finally. I was emailing my eldest brother about my situation, and outlined exactly what happened to me. After offering his sympathy he suggested that I write out a plan for next few years. I did that this morning, making note of my age instead of the year and I finished at 33 I was [and am as I am writing this] sad and frustrated that I have had to delay my plans so long because of that horrible woman, my NP.\n\nIn my emails to my brother I mentioned that as far as experiencing my 20s I maybe was lucky enough to get 18 months, the rest of it was spent recovering from her abuse and learning the things she neglected, forbade, or refused to teach me about life. And my childhood and adolescence (what I remember of it) also were mostly write-offs due to the abuse and my eccentric personality she molded me into. It's frustrating.\n\n I am glad that my depression, trauma, and false identity that I projected as a safety measure against her abuse are all gone. The time it took though is sad. By the time most people have purchased a house, I plan to maybe buy a car. Though I have been told by a few close friends I have more grit in my soul than most people, it is still sad.",

In my dream, I ALWAYS stop and think, \"I don't need to be here\", pick up my backpack, get in my car and start leaving for the house I live in, now.

I did speak to two different psychologists/counsellors last year, but neither of them were trained in npd or narcissism and in fact i found their advice quite dangerous in hindsight as they are not trained in this arena - and when i saw them i didnt realise my family are all NPDers - this was before i did so much research and worked it all out.\n I really need some uplifting advice to get through this. I don't mind being alone per se, as i enjoy my own company, and as an HSP, i need a lot of alone time....but i feel so alone, and my mind reels and replays and analyzes daily trying to make sense of my family, when i know one can never make sense of a narcs brain. I am highly analytical, so that makes it worse.\n I just don't want to bother opening my heart or self to anyone ever again, when the people i loved the most in this world have betrayed me and abandoned me over and over.

        "text": "Abbreviated Back story: a few years ago I was dating a man who seemed wonderful at first, and doted on me a lot in the beginning. After a few months, he started needling me with requests and disguised insults, manipulating me to behave, look, and act in certain ways for fear of punishment (withdrawal of affection, yelling, verbal abuse). I was always a people pleaser, which, when paired with my problematic tendency to set myself aside to make others happy, really must have made it easy for him.  Anyway, this went on for about 7 months until one night I woke up to him holding me down and raping me. I left him, he stalked me, I got the police to tell him to leave me alone, haven't heard from him since. \n\nNow, for the first time in years, I am interested in someone again. I like that he does his own thing much of the time, so he doesn't \"require\" me to do everything with him like the abuser did. He also doesn't make any kind of comments about how I could appear more attractive... He seems to like me as I am. He's considerate, kind, and I have very good friends who introduced us and vouch for his character as a very decent human being. \n\nMy problem, then, is in my head. I find myself reverting to the mindset I had with the poisonous bf, thinking that if I don't have this or that \"just so\", he's not going to like me anymore. I am normally quite a secure person,  at least when I'm single. I don't care what people think about how I live, dress,  etc. But suddenly I care what this guy thinks, because I really like him. \n\nMy question is, have any of you experienced this, and how do you get beyond it? Does it just take patience? Should I talk about it with this new man? He knows what happened to me, but I haven't told him about how I still struggle. When I wasn't seeing anyone, I wasn't struggling so much, though now I really am. I have to remind myself constantly that he is not that other guy, that he will not do the things the other one did, and that, despite my obvious imperfections, he still keeps coming around to see me and spend time with me. \n\nSorry for such a long post, I'm just hoping anyone out there can give me some advice. I don't know anyone else who has dealt with the aftermath of a narcissist. It's amazing how long the abuse lasts... Far longer than the relationship. I just want to move on and be happy with this wonderful new man. I'm terrified that I'll screw it all up. ",

        "text": " I will try make this straight to the point. Probably will be long!\n\nMy boyfriend (of 2.5yrs) had a friend.. they met through their mothers and were kind of pushed together at a young age. I will call friend K. And bf B So, when I met my boyfriend, we were friends for about a year, during this time K would also message me, often he would describe their friendship a lot more 'lovely and brotherlike' than my boyfriend did. They were in a band at the time and my boyfriend would often say if it wasn't for that they wouldn't talk.\n\nMe and boyfriend start dating and K gets very funny with me, I would get texts saying we will never last for a million different reasons.\n\nHe often lied and didn't care my bf knew it. Every week he would be moving to a new city because he was offered an amazing job. He was a bell boy at a hilton hotel his fb profile said \"hotel manager\" he claimed to us that he was getting a hotel built for him to manage. What's worse his mother and my bfs mother would believe him and compare him to my boyfriend who is at uni. They would put my boyfriend down and say how fabulous K's career is... even though none of this amounted to anything. Lies that he was going to buy a house and had thousands in the bank... but next month he was telling us he was relieved he could pay his rent.\n\nK treated my bf not nice, he would often say hurtful things about his appearance, and only seemed to be happy when things were going wrong for B. Whenever things went right like when we moved in together K would tear it down. He never asked how B was, what he has been up to, it was stories about his elaborate nights out and many women.\n\nHe dated with a number of girls and treat them horribly... then would call them psychos and they were crazy, his mother and bfs mother again believed this and again Poor K.\n\nOne night me and my bf went out for drinks and invited K, we then invited others a mixture of boys and their gfs etc. Half way through the night K pulled me to one side and said \"you shouldn't be here this a boys night, B shouldn't have let you come, you are never apart, he is obsessed, you won't last much longer.\" I was very upset and told my bf, he asked K to apologise and K laughed and said 'you know what am like hahah I am a dick' ( this is his throwaway excuse for everything. ) On nights out he takes drugs and one instance grabbed a girl and kissed her in front of her boyfriend The girl started crying and he just laughed. He took 15 year olds back to his apartment. He took drugs and was hospitalised, he then lied and said to his parents it was stress, then it was my bfs fault ( he wasn't even out that night with him ). My bf mother constantly tells B off for K's wrong doings. She never believes B.\n\nHe is very odd about his family, he calls his sister sexy and she will get loads of men, his 13 year old brother is a stud and going to get laid loads and will be a professional football player. It is all very odd.\n\nWhen K and my bf were out often my bf would have to get him out of situations especially regarding the band and if they were socialising with other bands. K would get enraged and start yelling they were terrible and he was the best guitarist ever and everyone else is shite. K's ego is insane. He eventually split up the band and moved to another one severing all friendships except my bf.\n\nHe has done many other things but the final straw came when he lied about me, he told mutual friends I had slept with the entire band and that is why they split up. That me and my bf have an open relationship, that I am controlling, we sell drugs it goes on and on.\n\nMy bf has cut all contact however K is telling sob stories to all mutual friends and saying he hasn't done a thing. All of B's friends are telling him.to get over it, including the mothers B has explained whole story but they think he is over reacting. How does he go about this. I have a feeling K is a narcissist however I am not sure. It's difficult when the mothers are involved, I feel K's mother has narcassistic tendencies as he does know wrong, she also makes side comments to me and B and is very passive aggressive whilst praising K at same time.\n\nAlso want to add just cos I just remembered it and it made me mad hahah, when we had been dating a little while K decided to rate girls out of 10, almost every girl they knew ( average or above ) got a 7 or 8. He then pushed to rate me and gave me a 4. The lowest of everyone which without sounding vain I wouldn't say was accurate, it wasn't the mark i was mad about it just felt he was going out of his way for a reaction and to make me feel uncomfortable especially as I kept asking him not to do it as did my bf.\n\n",

It's weird but nifty that online people treated me better than my FOC ever did...\n\nBonus: ** I found out our mods use some top-end tools to connect which alts belong to which Ns.**  As a former intelligencer, finding this out was reassuring and motivating :)\n\nThe mods are continually monitoring, and nuke a huge pile of disgusting comments before they reach our posts.  Mine was just a little poop that fell out of the avalanche of shit our mods shovel  on every shift....above/beyond duty... wow!\n\nJust remember it's the N, if they weren't targeting you then they'd just target someone else... the Keys are to remember you are not alone, that good people exist, that someone will help you... tough on the ACON within but part of the brain-cleaning necessary to recovery. \n\nYou're not alone here :)  And we can all talk without fear here because our admins.",

The one day a year I got to do what I wanted. I usually spent the whole day with my e/n mother doing my favorite things-pedicure, movie, lunch &amp; maybe some shopping. Then we'd have dinner &amp;/or dessert with the rest of my family. It as a full day about me that I got once a year. \n\nNow obviously things are better/different on this side of being NC. I have a loving doting husband and supportive MIL. My kids are adorable and sweet. I have generous caring friends who have really stepped up in helping us with diapers, etc since the baby arrived. \n\nAll I want for my birthday is to feel special and not be alone. I want dinner with my in laws/family -preferably out- on my actual birthday. We are having friends over this weekend to celebrate my birthday (&amp; I think everyone chipped in to get me a massage for my birthday which is awesome). But I'm feeling all sorts of intense emotions about my actual birthday day. My in laws want to cook me lunch on Sunday not on my birthday Tuesday.

So without further ado here is my story for today.\n\nFor a little backstory: I grew up having to beg everyone for everything and anything, always coming up for reasons for why I wanted or needed it. It has become second nature to me to just explain myself to avoid confrontation, I don't deal with my own Ns anymore but I still frequently have to deal with my boyfriend's Nmom so I haven't been able to heal from this quite yet.\n\nMy birthday is on the 15th but we can't celebrate that day because no one would be available, we decided to celebrate today instead. My bio mom's (Not an N) boyfriend's father picked us up and we went to his house. There was a bonfire and it was awesome. He asked if we wanted burgers. I felt bad because this man was so nice to us that he was offering us his food and I barely know him. He freaking mowed my lawn like it was nothing, no guilt trips, no gas lighting, I truly didn't know how to react. My birthday party was wonderful. He offered to cook the burgers and hotdogs on the grill. I even explained to the man why I was reacting weird to his generosity, he just said it was my birthday and I deserved it. \n\nSuch a big difference from yesterday when we went to a town with my boyfriend's mom 45 min away to pick some stuff up, I said I wanted to eat at a Chinese restaurant as it was basically my birthday trip and she literally told me she didn't care that we were getting fast food because a sit down restaurant was too inconvenient for her and she didn't have time. I was supposed to get a tattoo as well but she wouldn't let me because it wasn't \"within her time frame and her schedule\" when I told her that the world doesn't revolve around her and her schedule that other people have lives as well she just scoffed and said \"When you ride with me it does.\"\n\nI just didn't know people could be so nice, that people out there like that exist! I will sleep better tonight having gained some hope for humanity. Thank you for hearing what I have to say LifeAfterNarcissim. Hopefully, with some more time there will be more healing from the damage that has been done over these past 26 years.",

        "text": "Part of growing up with nparents is that we have to guess what normal is. When somebody behaves in an unhealthy, boundary-crossing, or even abusive way, it may take me a long time to notice, or I may just feel some discomfort.  It can take some time for reality to sink in, and for me to decide whether or not I want a certain person around. I also tend to experience a lot of guilt even after I make my decision. So I created this imaginary scenario for myself to help me remember why I do not want an nparent in my  life. I call it the Coworker Test, and you can use it on anybody.  \n\nHere's how it goes. \n\n**Step 1: Identify whose behavior you want to examine, and write down 3-5 behaviors that you feel uncomfortable with.**\n\nWrite down a few things that the nparent said or did that made you uncomfortable, or unsure of yourself. It's important to point out  specific behaviors that happen quite often. In this exercise, I'm using my mom and some real-life examples of stuff she said to me in my late 20s.  \n\nMom's behaviors:\n\n* asked me what kind of birth control i was on\n\n* told me that my breasts looked big, and i better make sure i'm not pregnant\n\n* made repeated comments about my physical appearance \n\n* kept quoting the bible to me, even after I asked her to stop.\n\n\t\t\nNow that you've written down a few actions/behaviors, you'll plug this person and their behaviors into an imaginary scenario. \n\n**Step 2-- Set the scene.**\n\nHere's where you'll use your imagination to create a safe and protected space that the person from your life is going to walk into. Think of an imaginary, ideal workplace.\n\nImagine that you work at a company that treats its employees very well. It's informal and casual, and you feel comfortable being yourself there. There's a lot of diversity. A lot of people who are a lot like you, and a plenty of people who aren't. The environment is fun but also cordial and professional. Everybody looks out for each other. You do a great job at what you do, and your team values you for your contributions and also respects you as a human being. You feel happy and safe every time you walk through the door.\n\nBeing a healthy work environment, there are some pretty strong boundaries in place. Trash talking, racial slurs, and sexual harassment are not tolerated. Physically lashing out at somebody else is out of the question.\n\n**Step 3: Place your nparent  into your imaginary scenario**\n\nHere's how it plays out with my nmom example. \n\nToday, you have a new colleague in your department. The new hire (aka nparent) sits right next to you for the next 8 hours. You've never seen them or met them before.\n\nThe workday starts, so you open up your laptop and start working.  Every few hours, your new colleague turns to you and says something a bit strange. And it's loud enough for your coworkers to hear. First, she says, \"8pointsforgryfindor, your breasts are pretty big! wow. you better make sure you're not pregnant!\"  You hear this and you freeze, and feel a bit sick to your stomach.  You figure maybe she has the first day jitters, and you don't want to attract attention, so you let it slide. \n\nA few hours later, she approaches you for help with a work-related question. After you answer her, she asks you what kind of birth control you're on, and tells you how pretty your teeth are, and that you should probably straighten your hair. You see one of your best work friends peer over your cubicle wall and mouth out \"What the hell was that!!?\"  You think to yourself, \"Houston, we have a problem.\" But you're really busy on a project, so you try to finish up.\n\nTowards the end of the day, the colleague tries to strike up a chat with you again. She talks about her hobbies.  She tells you she loves the bible, and teaches sunday school every week. You tell her that's nice and all, but that you aren't comfortable talking about it at work. Then she preaches at you and starts quoting the scripture. \n\n\"That's it!' you say to yourself. You get up from your desk and walk to the Human Resources department. You explain what happened, and you ask your nearby coworkers to corroborate your story. You say, \"Hey HR Manager, this new employee made me really uncomfortable with the following behaviors...\" The HR manager listens to you and is horrified. She asks your new colleague to pack up her desk and never come back. She is fired. \n\nThe next day you go back to work a little shaken, but relieved.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Questions to ask after you do the exercise**\n\n* If I worked alongside this nperson as a fellow adult, could they keep a job if they continued their present behavior? \n* If the nparent can't meet the bare minimum requirements of respect for others, do I want to be around them? \n* Would I ever willingly choose to be around this person in my social life? \n* Would I feel guilty for telling HR about a colleague who behaved like my nparent? \n* Would I feel bad for getting this person fired?\n\n\nIf you answered no to all or most of these questions, the person failed the test. \n\nIf anybody in my life doesn't pass this test, I won't willingly go into contact with them. It's a simple as that.",

        "text": "Hi all, so I am now 20 weeks pregnant and my cousin has said that she wants to throw me a baby shower closer to my due date. \nThe problem is I don't really have anybody to invite and the list has gotten smaller especially now that I'm NC with my NMom.\nMy cousin is suuuper outgoing and social and has hundreds of friends and I don't think she understands that I don't have many friends at all.\nI feel like growing up, I was never allowed to make and keep friends. I RARELY went out and spent most of the time at home or with NParents. I went on dates with my BF (whose now my husband and baby daddy) and hung out with my one friend from time to time. And even then, NMom would complain that I'm \"going out too much\". NMom and NDad make remarks that I have no real friends, when they were the ones encouraging me to be friendless.\n\nYesterday I broke down crying to my husband that I don't have enough friends to have a real baby shower.\nNow that I'm older and away from NParents, my husband thinks it's not so much my parents anymore, but that it's hard to maintain friends because of the stage we are at in our lives, relative to our peers. We are in our mid 20s, married and expecting a child, and have our own home. Even if we have acquaintances or friends, it's kind of hard to relate with them and I feel like they kind of pull away from us because we are at such different stages in life. I hang out with my one friend once a month and other than that I feel no reason to socialize because I enjoy my husband's company, his bro and his family's company more than anything.\n\n\nFor the baby shower, currently I have on my guestlist:\n\n-my cousin\n\n-my aunt\n\n-my MIL\n\n-my one best friend\n\nNot much of a list, I know :( My baby shower would be bigger if I invited NDad's female relatives but I really don't like them. Hubby's female relatives are great, but all are out of town and cannot make it.\n\nI guess I'm reaching out for support from those who also had trouble making friends because of their NParents, and looking for suggestions on how to make this baby shower or baby celebration work, I've heard of doing a co-ed combined family thing. Thanks in advance for any suggestions!\n\n**[edit]** WOW thank you so much for all your suggestions and words of support. I didn't realize I would get this many replies. Great suggestions. And and now I don't feel as alone in my situation anymore :) Thank you !!\n\n**[edit 2]** so DH and I are thinking of doing a co-ed picnic in the park as suggested by someone here, but we feel weird inviting his parents since I am not inviting my parents. We are thinking of this guestlist:\n\n-my cousin\n\n-my cousin's husband and their little daughter\n\n-me\n\n-my husband\n\n-my husband's brother\n\n-possibly my other cousin (my cousin's bro) and his new GF. I have not told him I am pregnant yet but I eventually might\n\nWhat do you guys think? this way I'd be leaving my cousin's mom and DH's parents out of this.. I feel like my parents being missing is the \"elephant\" in the room",

They may offer parental coaching services/classes to Mom &amp; Dad. I told them everything I knew (which admittedly isn't much, not even the parents' first names).\n\nThe neighbors may also report them, which will definitely accelerate the process.\n\nYa know... The worst part is, I tried to talk myself out of doing this, and I made up lots of reasons why I shouldn't call. \"I don't have an audio recording of them.\" \"I don't know the kid's exact ages.\" \"CPS won't do anything.\" And the worst one... \"CPS will invalidate everything I saw &amp; heard, and laugh at me as they hang up the phone.\"\n\nI told my therapist that I was nervous about calling (for the above reasons), even though I knew the reasons weren't valid. He said it sounded like I was regressing to my child-victim role, where I'm too small to help myself, or help anyone else; and what an awful trap that is. Those reasons that my mind invented, it's \"damned if you call, damned if you don't call\".\n\nWell, I talked it out, and I felt the truth in my gut, and I knew that I *had* to call CPS. So I did.

        "text": "When I had my son over three years ago, that was the start of everything-realizing who my nparents exactly were and what I went through; and most importantly realizing what love for a child should actually feel and be like. \n\nNow I'm two weeks postpartum with my daughter and I have a few random thoughts  \n\n-when I was getting the spinal block for my c-section and then the subsequent surgery it was scary and extremely difficult to remain calm. One thing that helped was that I kept telling myself \"if you can get through your abusive childhood, you can get through this next hour\". I kept saying that over and over to myself and have since repeated it when I've had physical difficulties over the last two weeks. It helps out things into perspective. It's my own version of \"this too shall pass\" I guess. Lol! It helps me realize that this is temporary and just a phase. Things will change. \n\n-I remember months after my son was born that my e/n mother mentioned to me that she was concerned in the beginning that I wasn't attaching well with my son. I remember feeling very guilty and sad when she told me that. My e/n mother was a nurse (who mainly worked with babies) so I took her word as gospel. Fast forward to now and my son is thriving and brilliant. He's autonomous and empathetic. He loves me and his Dad. And what's even funnier is I'm pretty sure I have C-PTSD and I read somewhere that it's more along the lines of an attachment disorder. So I find this whole thing quite funny and ironic. Don't you think? ;) \n\n-Lastly, we were at the pediatrician yesterday for baby girl's two week check up and actually got to see the doctor and not the NP. I forget how it came up but she made a comment about how she \"hasn't seen grandma in a while.\" At first I thought she meant my MIL who my son calls grandma but then I realized she's never come but once to the pediatrician with us (and that was just two weeks prior!) bc she lives an hour or so away. Then I realized she meant my mother! I had to quickly explain that I hadn't seen or spoken to them in two years (my nc anniversary is next week!) and why. She was very supportive. Just kinda came out of the blue!\n\nSo those are my random thoughts. Things are going pretty well here-well as much as they can when you have a newborn and sleep deprived parents and a hyperactive toddler. Lol today is the first day I'm completely on my own with both kids and we have a specialist dr appointment in another town (baby girl may be tongue tied). My husband took the baby last night in another room and let me sleep (yay melatonin!) for a solid 7'hours. So I'm feeling slightly more human this morning. Hopefully that'll last for a while :) hope everyone else is doing well!",

        "text": "Ch. 1: Adventures of the sober one\n\nSo I go into my glove box to get my wallet on my lunch break. It's cold today and I really want to get a pumpkin spice cappuccino from wawa. My wallet is there but my beautiful debit card is not. Instead his green emerald card is in it's place. I doubt it has any money on it or it wouldn't be there instead of my debit card. I immediately know that something is wrong. Last night I remember asking him if he happened to notice my wallet in my glove box when he went out and took my car. He said he didn't know because he never opened the glove box. He must be magic if he can make my card disappear without ever touching my wallet. I text him one simple sentence that I've had the pleasure of texting more than I can remember: k where is my debit card.\n Notice there is not a question mark at the end of that sentence. That is because it is not a question to me, but a statement. Those 6 little words unleash a whole plethora of questions when read by the receiver of that text. And they demand a lengthy explanation. Unless you have been living (or rather struggling to live) in my current situation, you may not understand. He certainly understood. I sit there staring at my phone biting my lip wondering what kind of answer I will get today. Will it be the \"I'm ignoring you and pretending my phone doesn't have service in this area of our humble home (the living room couch) and hope that you will just deal with this later after work.\" Or the \"I'm angry and appalled that you ever dare accuse me of having any shred of knowledge for the whereabouts of your beloved debit card.\" Or the \"Aw she found out, I'm fucked. Mind as well just tell her everything, there's no escaping this.\" Or lastly the \"What the fuck, Capitol letters, shouty font, angry words, explicit content, !!!!!!!!!!!!!!.\" Luckily I was swiftly answered with option number 3 including a complicated answer, excuse and apology. That's the best case scenario at this point. Apparently while I was enjoying the only period of my day when I'm not plagued with anxiety (sleeping) last night, he woke up and made the decision to drive to wawa and withdraw $120.00 from my bank account. This money was to be used for something other than the bills they were intended for. Mainly rent and my daughters expensive-ass Girl Scout trip to sleepover at the Zoo. He was planning to use this money for coke....\nNow I know what you're thinking. Or at least I would like to think I can remember a time when I was a \"normal\" person. A time when my first instinct would be to say things like ,\" why do you put yourself through this?! You could do so much better, dump him, kick him out, what is wrong with you?! He's a drug addict, blah blah blah\" but unfortunately I haven't felt \"normal\" for the longest time. I'm not too sure I could even adjust back into a \"normal\" lifestyle at this point. I see families sharply dressed shopping together, enjoying outdoor activities and attending school functions and feel in my gut that we will never be like this. I see myself in my quickly approaching 30's still living the same way. It's not that this is what I want for myself or my family, this is just Our \"normal\". This is what it's evolved into. I always remind myself that 'it's' been worse. I try to hold onto that mantra that we have been through worse. And by worse I guess I think back to what I've labled as \"The Dark Days\" or \"The Bad Times.\" The times from the past that have triggered my current anxiety and my existence of mistrust and stress. The period of my life that I never want to return to. That I had to drag myself to therapy for where I was told I'm experiencing a form of emotional PTSD. No, I've never been in a war or saw fellow soldiers die while I watched helplessly. But I've been in a place of total shock and desperation. I've felt utter loss and pain that I've never thought possible. \nWe had just had our daughter, our first and only child and been evicted from our first apartment all in one fell swoop. We had been evicted due to not paying rent. I think we owed them about $4,000 when all was said and done. I remember that day, he was working with an electric business that my dad had helped him get into and was out working. I had just given my baby a bath full of bubbles and giggles when I walked into the living room and found a paper jammed under our door. Thinking it was a random unimportant notice I unfolded it. I had to read it probably 6 times before I fully understood. We were being evicted and we had 10 measley days. With a new baby. I was going to night school full time to be a medical assistant and working 5pm-2am shifts at a bowling alley on weekends. I knew we were having some money issues otherwise he never would have pushed me to work those corny weekend shifts and take time from my precious baby. But I didn't really know the full extent. My breath wooshed out of my chest as I ran to the phone. I called our landlords office slowly feeling my chest tighten with each breath and my irritation level reaching about 100. The girl that answered seemed to totally not give any a shit about my super important issue. My voice cracked as I explained that we'd gotten an eviction notice and  that there must be some mistake. The first day of each month I'd sent Him to pay the rent with a check in full. I was beyond hysterics by the time the office manager got on the line to confirm that He had indeed not been paying rent. She said he'd given her $300 about 4 months ago, said he would return later to pay the rest then never actually returned. I managed to choke out the words,\" I'm coming to your office, I'll be right there!\" Before slamming down the phone. My mind was racing as I threw on my slippers, grabbed the baby, forgot my keys, ran back in to grab the keys and ran back out again. I remember passing by the Maintenence man on the way. My face was red,my hair looked like if been electrocuted, my eyes were tearing up and I was buckling under the weight of my emotions while trying to carry my baby. He tried to be nice and remarked how big she was getting. \"Yeah she is!\" I screamed at him. I remember feeling guilty for screaming at him and embarrassed at how crazy I must've looked to him. When I entered the office I was shown records of our payments. It was there in black and white. We no longer had our own place. The home I kept spotless for hours on end, the walls I scrubbed to try to make myself go into labor after being over a week past due. All of it. Was gone. Those clean-ass walls were to be enjoyed by someone else that could keep rent paid up on time. The carpet that my baby first crawled on, the nursery where I painstakingly folded tiny onesies and decorated perfectly for our new addition. The bedroom where He took care of me when I was sick, the closet my cat pissed in when he was jealous of the baby, the shower that I stained with fake tanner lotion. Our home, our responsibilities, our feeling like adults and my dreams of being a real family were all thrown out the window with that crisp piece of paper. I tried to shut down my mind and go into dumb-totally-oblivious mode. I tried to convince myself that there was something we could do, there was always hope, my dad can fix this. \nI called His cell. He answered as if everything was cool and the gang. My voice dropped about 3 octaves as I stated,\" Soooo, have you been paying rent?\" Silence for about 3 seconds. \"Of course I've been paying rent! What are you talking about. Ya know what, I'm at work! I can't deal with your bullshit right now! I'll see you when I get home!\" Click. I knew from that moment that I had 2 choices. Fight or flight. I chose fight. Sometimes I really wish I'd chosen flight. I think back on that day and wonder how different my life would be now, ten years later, if I hadn't decided that we would be a family no matter what. That this was my goal, a mom dad and baby living under one roof. I was going to have this if it was the last thing I do. This was the one thing I wanted, the one thing that would be mine. No one was going to take this away from me, not even him. From there on out I did the following: went to our bank to have our complete records printed out. Poured over them for hours with a highlighter. Matched up dates that money was given strictly for renting purposes. Confirmed that money was withdrawn in small hundred dollar  increments not spent on such renting. Found out that other than rent, several other checks had been bounced including health insurance, car insurance, medical bills, cable, electric and other various utilities. I went to school that night. I shouldn't have. While at a red light at a busy intersection I felt anxiety streaming through my veins. I thought, what would happen if I let go of the break and drove into oncoming traffic. I felt the impulse to move my foot. I managed to keep it on the break but it was as though I could not control my body and it was moving on its own. I was having a major anxiety attack. While driving. I worked to control my breathing, hyping myself up the whole way home, you can do this, you're okay, you're just driving home, everything's fine. I contacted my dad who would help us fix this and asked him to come over that night. I showed him the bank statements, explained the eviction then begged him to let all 3 of us move into his house until we could get back on our feet again. He was happy to have his only daughter and grandchild move in with him but first he wanted an explanation. He asked him where all the money went, What happened to the rent? Not to mention my portion of the rent that Dad was paying and all the other bill money. Are you gambling, do you have some sort of problem? Dad asked. Immediately he became angry. He raised his voice at us,\" No, not at all, is that what you think of me?!\" His excuse was that he was trying to pay astronomical medical bills that didn't even really need to be paid at the time and bounced them, causing us to get into such a hole that he could never dig us out. I admit even after pouring over those bank statements I still bought it. I believed his lame excuse because I wanted to. I wanted so much to believe him and feel that unconditional trust that movies make you think is real. After super Dad left that night, I joked that I was relieved he wasn't doing drugs because that's the conclusion I had jumped to and what I had assumed was going on at first. I tried to smack his ass almost like a 'I'm so relieved that we aren't homeless and you're not a closet drug addict so I'm trying to flirt with you now' type gesture. He turned and gave me a look of just pure hatred and disgust and said \"Don't.\" I now know in all my wisdom that he was just a textbook addict, projecting his guilt and shame onto me. At the time I thought my heart would fall out of my body. What had I done? What did I do to make him mad at me? Is this my fault? Maybe if I had just stood up and took charge of the bills and finances this wouldn't have happened. I should've stopped being such an emotional pregnant person and opened my eyes to what was going on. At this point I couldn't fathom that someone could be so selfish and such a narcissist when they just had their own child brought into the world. I ignored all the signs and signals over the year leading up to this that something wasn't right because my mind was warped in a tunnel of emotions and baby propaganda. I blamed myself for all that was happening and took the weight of it all on my shoulders to fix. My new plan was: move into my Dads, go back to being a family, make everything perfect and if I just love him enough all his problems will go away and he won't do drugs anymore. This was not the smartest of my plans. I thought that if I had enough hope and faith and if I wanted it all bad enough, it would come true. Well my beautiful plan was a failure, to say the least. I emphasize this day with such detail because it was such a momentous point. It was the starting point of \"the dark days\", \"the bad times,\" the pain-in-the-ass period\" if you will. And this my friend was only the first day.\n",

Ummm...he tried to steal your children so the state would give him twenty grand to buy a bigger house? That's a good enough reason, isn't it? Or how about the time he left your wife to walk six miles in a thunderstorm to make it to your son's hearing appointment, because he figured he'd make me miss the appointment and then cry about \"medical neglect\"? Isn't that good enough? How about the fact that the stress of dealing with TWO psycho families of origin caused two heart attacks in your wife before the age of forty? That'd be a reason to be annoyed that you spoke to him, right?!\n\nI guess I don't understand why DH chooses to continue to play games with his FOO. I don't even acknowledge mine anymore, but he still seems to care what his thinks. I can forgive my kids for being shocked into speaking to NBIL (and my youngest is autistic, so he doesn't have a clue), but DH KNOWS how manipulative and psycho these people are, and still half pretends everything's fine. \n\nOkay.

        "text": "There was a nice older man living next door to me. He recently moved out, and now the house is occupied by a family: Shouting Dad, Shouting Mom, and three children (ages 0-5, I think?) who are constantly being shouted at, and driven to tears.\n\nShouting and shouting and shouting. I'm in the backyard once or twice a day, and I swear the odds are about 66% that I hear Mom and Dad shouting. Sometimes their windows are closed, and I can *still* hear it clearly.\n\n\"Get your shit together!\" Dad screamed at his 3-year-old son, then (I think) he locked the kid in the next room, and the kid sobbed and sobbed. Mom was there, and she let this happen. This was one moment amidst a long barrage of awful parenting, both Mom and Dad were shouting at the kids for an hour. I was gardening that day (...well, *trying* to focus on gardening...) and this was very triggering. After a few minutes of this, I started dissociating; then I realized I was dissociating; then I remembered that this was my coping mechanism, growing up in my parent's awful, sick, angry, toxic household.\n\nEventually Dad started the car, then sat in the car for almost 10 minutes, then Mom came out and shouted at him, to check if he was okay? Then he drove off. Then the kids were left alone with Mom, and she shouted like crazy, shrill freak-out levels of rage and terror erupting from her mouth. A human monster.\n\nIf I had any doubt that my parents were abusive, that doubt has now been crushed. My household was nightmarish, and so are these neighbors.\n\nI don't know what to do. I guess I'm posting this because I need advice. Should I call CPS? I have no idea if that will do any good. The Dad apparently has a tech job, I'm sure he earns enough money so it looks like the family isn't living in poverty. What does CPS look for?\n\nIn a lucky coincidence, I'm moving to a new house in a few weeks (this was arranged before the neighbors appeared), but part of me feels like I'm abandoning these kids next door, who I haven't even met. I want to do *something*.\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "I could not wait to cut my therapist loose after the latest incident with my sister the narcissist. My therapist had me focusing on my future and every time something new would come up with Caroline, she would tell me that there is nothing I could do, that I cant change her. My sister is the most toxic, unpleasant person I have ever met.\nWhen my mom passed away 3 years ago, Caroline decided that she was going to be part of the family again. Her only involvement with the family was meeting my dad at the Rose Bowl for one hour on \nChristmas day.Caroline hated my mom and refused to come to the house. The day after mom died, Caroline stepped into the house for the first time in 10 years. Dad, who has dementia, and worshipped the ground my mom walked on, said to Caroline and myself as he left with my brother Pete to work out funeral and reception arrangements,\" dont mess with moms stuff, thats my stuff. Those are my memories\"\nCaroline took it upon herself to eliminate any and all memories of mom by tossing all of moms belongings in garbage bags. Mom smoked so Caroline felt that moms stuff could not even be donated. \nWhen I walked in the room, Caroline has one hand on her nose and the other hand is used to toss moms belongings in garbage bags. When I see this, I am completely rattled and ask her,\"what are you doing?\" She snaps at me and says,\" you cant even donate this stuff John\" The devil himself is in moms room tossing her belongings in to trash bags. Twenty minute later I went in again to attempt to get her to stop, but she knew I was rattled. I was. I could not believe what I was seeing. I yelled at her, \"YOU ARE A FBOMBing-( the most unpleasant word ever) then I left. I spent the rest of the day shaking on my couch. She got me that day. She won. A week later, from San Francisco, she arranged for Salvation Army to come by dads house in Pasadena and pick up all the garbage bags. She never asked dad if that was ok. My dad throws nothing away and he certainly had no interest in donating his wifes belongings. Caroline called from SF that day and asked dad if Sal Army came by. Oblivious, dad said, \"Salvation Army? ummm I'm not sure. Let me ask John. John did salvation army come by?\"\n\"No dad we cancelled that.\"\n\" I guess we cancelled that Caroline. Anyway how are you?\"\nShe was livid when she heard I canceled. One would think that she might feel bad about her actions. Remorse. Nope, Caroline was pissed. It would soon made sense as to why she was so adamant about having moms stuff donated. I am happily seeing dad everyday after work and becoming his caregiver. Anyway, about 5 weeks after mom passed, dad was ready to finally go through moms stuff, that has been sitting in garbage bags. We were not on Caroline's time or salvation army's time. We were on dads time and he was ready. We went through two to three bags a night. It brought tears to dads eyes when he saw how Caroline had treated moms belongings.  One bag would have gold earings, trash, clothes, cigarette butts ect. She knew if she did not get moms stuff donated, than dad would see first hand how she treated moms stuff. Dad's short term memory is shot so he cant fully understand what Caroline has done. Six months later she would rise from the ashes and start plotting her next move. She decided that the situation with dad was not working so she attempted to force his hand and move him into a nursing home. Dad did not want this and made that clear. Her friend is a realtor and she gave the listing to her buddy. She thought that if she gets dad into a home than it would make sense to sell his house.\nDad is in pretty good hands with the care team we have assembled for him. Dad's good friend Bill, and myself go to all of his neurologist meetings. We feel that any major decision should be run by the neurologist. We also have Mary on our team who is a senior care specialist. She has 30 years experience, knows all the nursing homes in Pasadena, loves dad to death, and is confused as to why Caroline is forcing dads hand. What is amazing is Caroline is trying to pull this off without consulting with anybody on our team. Our team and dads attorney all agree that we should honor dads request to stay at home. I move in with dad. Carolines problem is now me. Her plan is starting to fall apart. Dad sends her a stern warning not to continue to put him in a home, and to stop trying to sell his house. She responded to that email from dad accusing me of writing it, calling me a coward who hides behind dads computer, embarassment to the family, to myself, pathetic. She is so out of line. If your going to call someone a thief or a liar, you better be 100 % sure. \nShe wanted to make good on her offer of the listing to her friend, so she planned an emergency family meeting, 6 weeks later. By the time of the meeting we were air tight. We had letters from friends, dads attorney, his neurolgist. We also had solid representation at the meeting. Bill, Mary, Wes, Dad, Myself in this corner. Caroline and sort of brother Pete in the other. They both live in San Francisco. Pete could not believe what he was up against at the meeting. The letters, Bill, Mary and Wes. He was not ready for that. Caroline showed up an hour late to the meeting. She would later say the reason was that her flight was delayed. I asked why she did not call. She said she did not have her cell phone. Why are we lying? At the meeting she waited about 5 minutes then took over the meeting. She is rambling on and on pissing everybody off, then she drops the bomb. She said,\" and I want to make something clear, I never tried to put dad in a home and I never talked to anybody about selling his house.\" She would not have said this had she known that we all had a copy of her email where she says she wants dad into highlands home by the end of summer, and that \"we should sell the house because it would do spectacularly in this market.\" Sorry dad, the market is hot right now so you have three weeks. It was not until after this meeting that I realised what I was dealing with. It was obvious that she had a disorder of some kind. I typed in her traits and got some relief knowing I was dealing with a narcissist. It gets worse. I'm not kidding. Thanks, John\n\n\n\n\n\nl",

        "text": "Due to some recent fucked up relationships, I was reading about attachment styles. My mind was blown upon learning that I have a fearful attachment style...meaning in the most basic of explanations that I want to get close, but I'm scared of basically everything, not sure how to find the gray area so I cling and then leave fully. \n\nI was reading that it pertains to how you were treated as a child. How the world is new/scary to you, and so you try to go to your parent for comfort, but they either don't give it or they are scarier themselves...\n\nI just want to share a few things that really hit me. \n\n1. This phrase: \"Children with secure attachment see their parent as a secure base from which they can venture out and independently explore the world\" From this article: http://www.psychalive.org/what-is-your-attachment-style/\n\n2. The Still Face experiment. On youtube there's an experiment where the mom just looks at their baby with a still face, and the baby freaks out. It's really sad, and hit me HARD. I started crying half-way through and it's only a 2:48 video. (trigger warning) \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apzXGEbZht0&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n3. This: \"The child cannot escape the anxiety coming from the environment and cannot be soothed by the parent. To make matters worse, the parent’s behavior might actually increase the child's anxiety and impel the child to once again approach the scary parent\"... \"these children can be seen to approach the parent, only to freeze and withdraw or wander about aimlessly.\" \nfrom this article: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-freedom-change/201505/come-here-go-away-the-dynamics-fearful-attachment\n\nI guess I'm just sharing my research stuffs with you guys, as an adult child of narcissists I've gotten a lot of not only still faces, but sneers, and have come in contact with a lot of trauma. I'm mad that I formed these coping mechanisms, but eager to change them and grateful that I've come as far as I have. I guess I'm also grateful for the \"avoidance\" part of this coping mechanism as it has allowed me to be able to go NC when need be.\n\n",

I didn't have much Internet at the last job that I was talking about so I didn't get any of your awesome, supportive comments until today! I wish I could reply to every one (I may later as I plan on spending the afternoon at the library). \n\nI just wanted to give an update because things have taken a turn. I was having to live in a cabin with 3 other people in the middle of nowhere, and things quickly turned hostile there, reminding me way too much of the violent, volatile household I grew up in. Being horribly isolated in literally the middle of nowhere with almost no connection to the outside world made this far more terrifying, and I made the decision to leave. \n\nI really wanted to return to the location of my previous job, but the job I worked with there is ending and all of the people I worked with are leaving for other states. I have nobody there to shack up with for a bit, despite that I miss it. Living in my car there right now also likely wouldn't be a good idea, considering it is very hot there 24/7 this time of year. \n\nSo I returned to my home state since I have to take care of a few things in my hometown anyway, not that I want to stay there at all. A friend who lives 45 minutes from my hometown took me in for two days to help me feel a little anchored and with a little normalcy, but I can't stay long-term with him. I'm now living in/out of my car around the area with absolutely no idea about my future. \n\nIt seems being RBN has made a really difficult twist on that - I can't suck it up and go back to living with relatives at all, for one. It also seems like most of my \"friends\" here are not as supportive as I once thought they were. It's been total silence, not even an asking if I'm okay or anything. I don't expect anything from anybody, but even a lack of a few words is terrifying, and makes me feel as rejected and unwanted as I did the entire time I lived with my Nparents. ",

But when he got old and I had children it was not possible I felt - so we did meet and I cared for him on his deathbed.

I have pressured myself into some level of functionality (my mom was bipolar and on medical drugs so really I was an abandoned child - saving mysef with perfectionism and compulsive fetishism - to get acceptance and  vicarious parenting.) He clearly lacked empathy. In my novels and poems there were lots of hints at my having bi or homo issues...and so once he told me: \"It would have been a tragedy if you would have been gay.\" \n\nI had to overcome my symptoms (several compulsive/addict stuff) in order to be able to really accept and like myself as I am. It included Freudian therapy EMDR and somatic /touch/ therapy /to give acceptance to the \"inner child\" part of me/. \n\nAll this together made it possible to skip all my symptom behaviors (which were a dysfunctional way of vicarious parenting) and then I realized that I am able to like and accept myself as I am. \n\nI do not know if he was a narcisstic person or just a cold father - his father died when he was 3 ys old -  because otherwise he did care for me on a financing level and even became emotional about it (rarely: when I wanted to stay abroad and he pressured me into coming home.)

        "text": "Hey guys.. so I've been in therapy for 3 years, and overall it has been successful in ridding myself of FLEAS and co-dependant traits. I am by no means perfect, but I feel as if I have a pretty good handle on my life now. Specifically, I am really good at saying \"NO\" to problematic behaviours/people. \n\nI've finally got back into dating. With every red flag I've encountered, I've been able to draw a boundary and disengage from the situation before getting hurt. I've developed a keen sense of N radar and I've come too far in my healing process to slide back into compassion or tolerance for N behaviour. Trouble is, seems everyone I'm meeting has that N poison in their body.\n\nNo one is passing my red flag checklist and I haven't been able to date longer than a few months because of this. I've been trying to draw parallels and find answers as to what a healthy relationship looks like, but at this point I am only seeing two different types of relationships: 1) Couples who stay together to re-enact abandonment issues upon each other and therefore trauma bond into a feedback loop of abuse (e.g. my parents) or 2) people who give up or settle for less than they deserve in order to avoid being alone (probably the healthier of the two since the only negative is existential resentment).\n\nIt would be helpful if some of you could share what your idea of a \"healthy\" relationship looks like, and maybe whether you find it to be achievable in the modern world. I am really struggling to see this situation in a realistic framework. Perhaps a bit grandiose, but it feels like I've been woken up but look around to see that everyone is still unconscious in delusion. It is extremely isolating and discouraging, particularly because I've engaged in so much personal growth. I need to know that I'm not alone and that there is really life after narcissism.",

        "text": "Just looking for a little encouragement. It's been 2 months and 5 days since things went south with my LDR Nex - no contact (from me) since then. He told me to \"move on\" (via text) and disappeared from my life, after I confronted him about his ill-treatment of me during a recent visit.\n\nAt first, the anger buoyed me through the pain, I was too angry and indignant, too ashamed, too embarrassed. I would NOT give him the satisfaction of having me beg for his attention. The despair was blunted by anger, but that faded quickly.\n\nThen the anger faded to depression, feelings of unworthiness, and the sense that my entire world had imploded. I began the long process of moving on. I was almost at a point where I had stopped thinking of him every day, all day - and then, he reached out to me almost a month to the day.\n\nSaid he \"misses me\". Said he \"deleted my number\", and \"intended to message me back\" and wants to rekindle our relationship. What a load of horseshit. Funny he knew just how to contact me when he wanted to (via reddit, email).\nReceiving those messages sent me into a tailspin - if I needed any proof that this was some kind of N game he was playing, this was it. After telling me to get lost, get gone, fuck off and die...you saunter back into my life and ask \"hey what's up?\". Fuck that. On one hand, it was like ripping a scab off a wound and bleeding all over again, but I also get perverse pleasure that he even approached me to rekindle - mainly because I enjoy denying him.\n\nWhen he contacted me, all the progress I had made disappeared. I was thrown back into the heightened emotions that went along with the initial event - back to thinking about him all day, every day, feeling shame and anger and depression and unworthiness and pain.\n\nIt's been 23 days since he attempted to rekindle. I have not responded, and took steps to block him from both avenues of contact. Things have been fine and I have been managing, distancing myself...until the last few days.\n\nLately, I can't stop wanting to get back in touch with him. I feel like I miss him as a person, despite the terrible things he did and is. The last few days have been a big struggle, I am so, so tempted to reach back out to him and I know that it's the wrong thing to do, so I have resisted.\n\nI worry that my resolve will falter soon. I am trying to figure out why I want this person back in my life. I worry that I vilified him too much; that yes maybe he has N personality traits but he isn't all rotten. And what was my role in this, I am not innocent, is this just a big misunderstanding where his bad personality traits came against mine and ended in such a spectacular failure?\n\nI want desperately for there to be a way to have him back in my life. I flip-flop frequently, telling myself there is no way he can be a part of my life while being a mentally/emotionally healthy part of it. Then, I'll find myself wracking my brain trying to find some excuse, no matter how small or insignificant, that I could use to gloss over everything and take him back into my life. I tell myself that \"this time will be different\" and \"I will set boundaries\" but I know from how I feel when I think about him that I will once again find myself dancing to his tune, as always.\n\nI just wanted to vent and get this out \"on paper\" and hear some feedback on the situation.\n\nI will remain strong. Any discomfort I feel now will never compare to the negative emotions I experienced as his partner.",

Yeah, like we could afford that!), how do his parents feel about him dating her (as if she's unworthy?), where do they go on dates, stuff like that.

But WHY this obsession with our daughter's boyfriend? They're eighteen year old kids, this is the first relationship either of them have ever had, so it isn't like they're going to run off and get married tomorrow. Are they just looking for something to gossip about, or could they be planning to try to sabotage their relationship with each other? Why the sudden attempts to re-establish contact?

First of all, for you guys and how supportive, comforting and caring you have all been through my pregnancy and my anxieties. High fives for everyone. \n\nSecondly, I'm also so deeply touched and grateful for my amazing MIL. She's been watching our son since Saturday and taking him to visit us here at the hospital every day (&amp; it's an hour and a half drive from her house to the hospital one way). She's brought us food, drinks etc.. Last night our dog sitter couldn't stay with our dogs, so she suggested that my husband go home with our son (who has missed him something FIERCE! I'm apparently chopped liver lol) and she would stay the night at the hospital with me since I still need a hand. \n\nSo she stayed last night. We've always had a good relationship but we've never had a chance to bond one-on-one like we did last night. (This part is gonna make me cry) I realized that *I had a mom-a real life mom-last night and it's been years since I've experienced that*. She was attentive, sweet, doting &amp; wonderful. We had deep, emotional conversations. I could talk to her about anything and not have concerns about the impact of what I was saying. We joked about Farts lol she doted on my little girl. \n\nI woke up this morning feeling *wonderful*- full of gratitude, love, joy and peace. I have this beautiful baby girl in my arms who is just perfection and I got to be a daughter who needed a mother last night. I didn't have to be the \"I have to be strong to do this myself\" type last night. I needed help and I gratefully took it. I haven't been this filled with joy in a long long time (with the exception of my son's birth of course!!) \n\nAnyways, I can't type through tears lol. We've gotta get ready for discharge. We are busting out of this place! Oh and s/n: my nparents never showed up at the hospital (*knock on wood*) and hopefully will continue to stay away. ",

I have followed RBN for a while and with some coaxing today, a fellow redditor/friend has encouraged me to reach out and research this. In reading into Narcissistic parents so many things have fallen into place. So very much about my relationship with my Nmum (I am still getting used to the terminology) suddenly makes sense. I am on my own completely cut off for the first time in my life.\n\nI'm 28, have no real ability or memory of how to live like an adult. I feel like a teenager who just has their crappy part time job and just ran out of the house. I literally did. I don't know what to do from here. I mean the bare basics, I have just got out of a toxic situation (for full details I did post a long wall of text cathartic release and vent on RBN) with a controlling Nmum. She dominated and influenced much of my life, bills and such were deemed \"too much\" for me to handle, and I was told I didn't make enough to live on and what a spendthrift I was I could never make it on my own.\n\nI am staying with my boyfriend who has been very supportive, but has no experience with how to handle a socially anxious depressive with all the mental side effects that being a child of a Narc entails. I love him dearly and he tries but he too is a socially anxious depressive of a different flavour and I can tell the stress is getting to him. I have thankfully already found a place to move to so logistical stuff is mostly taken care of, but I am totally lost as to what else to do. I don't even know whether there is anything else I should be doing. I feel lost, emotionally drained and everything still hurts. I still find myself bursting into tears randomly with just emotional release.\n\nAre there even next steps????",

I qualified for unemployment and filed, so I was getting by financially, but only just.  Monday afternoon I got a call from a temp agency, asking me if I could start the next day at a place that was so desperate for someone, they didn’t even need to interview me.  I accepted the job and started yesterday.  Loooong story short, I realized this morning that I was in way over my head and I knew it wasn’t going to work out.  I had every reason to stay and muddle along because the pay was good and I probably would have been hired on eventually, with even better pay and benefits, but it just didn’t feel right.  So I pushed myself to do the very difficult task of telling the people at the new job that I didn’t think I was right for the position, and I went home.  It felt really good to leave, and it felt like the right decision even though I had nothing other than my intuition at that point to justify my decision (and who knows, I may never get any validation for that decision, that's just the nature of intuition sometimes).  \n\nFortunately, I did not have to fight the inevitable tide of self-recrimination for very long; an hour after I got home, I got a call from my old job, asking me if I could come back full time (to work in a different position) and indefinitely.  It’s still a temp job with no benefits, and it’s the same pay, which wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either, but I’ll be working with someone I really like and in a relaxed, quiet, low stress atmosphere.  I really enjoyed working at this company before, my only complaint was that I wasn’t a permanent employee, so therefore no benefits.  Maybe I'll get hired on eventually, maybe I won't, but the new work I'll be doing will be something new to add to my resume, and being able to keep my stress level relatively low whilst being gainfully employed is a huge benefit in and of itself.  \n\nSo I just thought I’d let y’all know.  I really appreciate the support I received a month ago when I posted about losing my job, and I wanted to give you an update.  :)\n\nEDIT: to add a clarification\n\nPostscript:  Thanks everyone!  :) \n",

The job was easy to quit, but the only place I could go from there was back to my Nparents. Instead, I piled everything I needed in my car in January and drove from North Carolina to California because CA is where I've always wanted to live. It's been my pie-in-the-sky for at least ten years but I was always bullied and terrorized out of going. The catch: my psychotically Nmom and severely BPD dad still held the title to my car. I still felt obliged to live by their rules because they could pull that out from under me any time they felt like it.\n\nTwo week ago I asked for the title (my dad had always said the car was mine. He was more than happy to give it to me. My mom, not so much. CONTROL CONTROL CONTROL.) At any rate, I was a grownup, I did all the things I needed to, I filled out all my forms and made an appointment at the DMV. This morning I officially got my California driver's license, officially own my car, and officially have it registered in my name.\n\nDriving back to the house I share with two random people from Craigslist, I started crying because I was overwhelmingly, delightfully, completely free. I AM FREE. The only thing I have left between me and *total freedom* is to get signed up for CA health insurance and my application is already processing.\n\nI've been working lately on *feeling my feelings* and the relief and joy I felt at being completely in control of my life is the strongest thing I've ever let myself feel. I've spent the past few months feeling utterly dejected when I apply for jobs and get rejected etc., but at this point I feel like I can apply to anything I want, do whatever I want, and actually be gainfully employed. The $281 car registration fee was a small price to pay to buy myself such freedom. Who knew such a feeling existed?",

        "text": "I was checking out my aunt's Facebook page.  This is my father's sister, and I've been NC with my father for decades for truly excellent reasons.  My father's ex-wife (my ex-stepmother) is FB friends with this aunt for some reason (probably no reason other than they are all nuts).\n\nSo my aunt posted a link about some Tennessee church pastors who have been involved in sex trafficking.  My ex-stepmother posted a comment about how she can still be surprised by evil.\n\nUh, yeah.\n\nLet me run down for you some of the evil she was involved in when I was living with her and my father as a teenager:\n\n1) Multi-hour-long sessions of criticizing me for, well, everything.  This would happen a few times a week.\n\n2) Creating fucked-up household rules like I should only wash the dirty dishes that *I* used but no one else's.  (I think this was part of some weird goal of trying to pretend I wasn't *really* living with them.)\n\n3)  Calling up members of my *mother's* family to tell them stories about how awful I was and not to believe anything I tell them about what was going on and definitely NOT to help me.  Unfortunately, these relatives ate that up and complied, even though they supposedly thought my father was evil and totally to blame for a million things.  When it came to joining forces against someone more vulnerable, suddenly none of that was a problem.\n\n4) Stealing my university tuition receipts (i.e. not giving them to me when they came in the mail) to claim MY tuition on their tax return even though they had contributed $0 to my university expenses.  Their argument was that my father would get a bigger tax refund from the receipts than I would, so that made it OK.\n\n5) This is sort of the capper:  Locking me out of the house at night according to a random on-the-spot curfew.  I had a key, but they would put the security chain on whenever.  Some nights they would let me in but then there would be horrible scenes.  Some nights they didn't, and I am very fortunate that I had friends and a boyfriend I could stay with.  I still can't get my mind around that one - locking your *teenage daughter* out of the house at night.  Really bad things happen to girls in that situation.  They were putting me at a terrible risk.\n\nOh wait, got another one:\n\n6) Writing a letter to me during my first year at university telling me that I'm horrible and they wouldn't want to have anything to do with me if I weren't their daughter and some other awful stuff I've blocked out.  Basically disowning me.\n\nThey both also put my sister through even more fucked-up shit.\n\nSo, YEAH.  This is the shit pulled by a woman who claims to be \"surprised\" by evil.",

        "text": "Sup LAN, I just need to vent. I'm in my 30s and was staying with my Ngrandmother, stuck in a town with a bad economy and no long-term jobs, so I did the only thing I could at the time and headed back into the field I studied in college. Unfortunately, there are nothing but seasonal jobs in that field and I managed to line up two in different parts of the country.\n\nI'm now on the second one and it is miserable. The first was awesome, and I grew to love where I was, and may consider moving back to the state in general although the job or my awesome coworkers will no longer be there. Or I may move back to the city 1 hour where I was living with my Ngrandmother because I still know a lot of people back there and miss them. \n\nThe thing is, now that I'm doing this job that I hate, in a place I hate, it's hitting me hard how much all of this is just because I have had to continue running from an Nfamily, and I resent it immensely. I've never really been able to figure out what I want or need to do with my adult life. I just keep having to take what's available to me, even if it goes against most or all of my values, or literally beats up my body (these jobs are physically difficult and are almost beyond my physical means). I'm intensely miserable and angry here, and realize I'm just going to suffer more in two months, because I have nowhere to go when this job runs out (I've been job searching without much luck) and will probably be homeless (but living in my car, at least I've got that) until I can determine what is next. \n\nIt's just eating me up that this is what my life has become all because of being RBN, even at 33. I'm in a state I didn't want to ever come to, doing a job I didn't actually want to do besides it just being what was available at the time and to finally get away from my hateful Ngrandmother, now running myself into the ground physically and emotionally. I can't even see another way right now. I'm posting this here because I don't even have anybody else I can tell this to, because the friends I do have (which, by the way, I most likely won't be able to stay with when this job ends because of various reasons such as one being newly married and others with no space) just don't understand it. \n\nAll of this also makes me feel invisible and disconnected from humanity as a whole. To know that I can end up in the middle of nowhere, where nobody seems to \"get\" the fact that I'm just doing what I can to get by, and to know nobody really cares where I end up blows my mind. \n\nI'm not sure where else I'm going with this, but I know those of you who have been RBN do know where I'm at in a sense.

        "text": "Hi LAN,\n\nIt’s been a couple weeks since I reached out for help and you guys responded with so much support. Now that I’m on the other side, I can really see just how important your responses were to me - they are what pushed me to get out of that hole. A few people expressed an interest in hearing from me once I came back to myself, so I thought I’d check in and tell you about some of the things I’ve learned.\n\nIt took me about two weeks until I was ready to go in for therapy again. During that time I managed to reconnect with my husband and talk with a couple friends. All of those connections helped a lot with balancing the freak-out in my brain. I was able to talk with my husband and my IRL RBN friend about my therapy worries and they were both supportive and encouraging. Both have seen me go through these slumps where I become afraid of the attachment I have with my therapist, and both helped me to think through my hesitation. Both of them thought that I should try therapy again, that it was worth sticking it out and that some of my worries were just in my head, not actual fact (this turned out to be true).\n\nThe truth is that I have a very hard time when I miss a therapy session. It has become my outlet and I have formed a very strong attachment with my therapist. But, as I said, that attachment often really scares me. This type of attachment was not safe growing up and so I constantly worry that I’ve asked for too much, pushed too hard, and she’s going to tell me she can’t handle me anymore. I think that’s what happened when she wasn’t able to immediately provide the help I was asking for. I freaked out that she was done with me and my Tough Guy coping mechanism kicked in, “Fine, no one cares. I’ll just take care of myself.” But I was in such a bad place that I couldn’t really take care of myself.\n\nAs the week without therapy turned into two weeks, I started to really stress about how unsettled I felt the relationship was. I very much don’t like to leave things unresolved, and I felt there was a lot I needed to tell her that I hadn’t. So, with a lot of encouragement from my husband and friend, I emailed my therapist and asked if she had an available appointment. She responded almost immediately that she had time the next day and she was really looking forward to seeing me.\n\nI was a nervous wreck until the appointment. I didn’t sleep that night and my body was displaying all of the physical symptoms I get when my anxiety peaks. But I knew I had to take care of this and soon because the next day I had a dentist appointment which I was even more nervous about (severe dental anxiety, story for another day). I didn’t want to be approaching the dentist appointment with my anxiety so high over an unrelated issue. So I went in and… it was fine!\n\nAs always, my therapist was happy to see me, calm, understanding, and supportive. As she always has been. I had written her a letter explaining what happened because I didn’t trust myself to say it out loud. That helped a lot. I handed it to her and as she read it she said “Mhm, oh yes. I understand how you could have felt like that.” And she wasn’t angry or upset with me - which continues to amaze me. [In my house, you NEVER had a problem with Nmom. If you did you would be yelled at for hours and then given the silent treatment for at least a week. She would only talk to you again once you’d sufficiently groveled and berated yourself for being ungrateful.]\n\nIt was a tough session for me but it really cleared the air and we came up with a game plan for what to do if this happens again. And I came out with a couple realizations: 1) She really *does* seem to care about me. She really does want to help and she is doing as much as she can. 2) While I so appreciate all of the suggestions and support I got on this sub, I think many of us are quick to dump people. I don’t blame us at all and am very guilty of this too, it’s how we learned to survive and how we continue to protect ourselves. There are people out there who would take advantage of us, but there are also some who just need another chance. It’s something I need to remember - there do exist people who want to help me, even (and maybe especially) when I find myself in that very bad place.\n\nToday I am feeling so much better and I feel like I’ve made some big leaps in recovery. This seems to happen a lot after I go through these slumps (anyone else?). I took care of myself well at the dentist and am asking for and receiving the help I need. I feel comfortable in my relationship with my therapist and in a good place with my husband and toddler. I’ve also been more attuned to the things going on in my head, noticing and being curious about them instead of being swept away by them. That is a really big thing for me. \n\nOn Tuesday I had my two-year NC anniversary and I’m feeling strong. It was a good reminder of the kind of people who are not trying to help me and how different that feels from the people who do care.\n\nI think that’s mostly it. I’m definitely feeling much calmer now and that I am able to care about things again. I’m working hard on self-care and am making some progress. But mostly, I just feel alive again which is a really good place to be. Thanks a lot if you read all of this and thank you again for all of your support!",

        "text": "As a lot of you know, we are expecting our second baby very soon (like by the end of the month). We have a 3yro at home. This pregnancy has been very rough on me and I've become physically more and more of an invalid with each passing week. I'm pretty much on bed rest now. My amazing husband has had to take on everything and has become very overwhelmed which turns him into a ticking time bomb of anger and anxiety. It's very unlike him. He's the rock. He's the emotional constant. \n\nSo he's been trying to use coping skills, grounding techniques etc. I've been trying to be supportive and as not needy as possible  (which is difficult when you can hardly do anything for yourself). He's been running on E for months now and it keeps getting worse. \n\nFinally last night he broke down and shared his feelings with me. It wasn't anything I didn't know but it was good for him to actually talk to me about him. I did find out that he's been throwing up at least 1-2x a week from the stress and anxiety. He threw up twice yesterday and almost a third time while we were talking. Understandably I was/am very concerned. But he got it (it being the emotional stuff) out-most of it at least. He was afraid he wouldn't be able to with out screaming, yelling, etc. at me for no reason. That's what had kept him from sharing for so long. He said he didn't want to stress me or the baby it and he didn't want to trigger my PTSD. That killed me. He was so afraid of-even for a moment- me seeing him as a monster, as my nfather, that he kept it inside. I assured him that would never happen and that he is my safest place. I gave him examples to support it. I listened and comforted. I encouraged him to continue to talk to me (&amp; I promised I would tell him if it got too much for me) &amp; to talk to someone else too (mom, friends, therapist) since I'm part of the stress. He agreed. \n\nToday he talked to one of his best friends and aid it was therapeutic. He says emotionally he feels like a new man (though physically he has a bad emotional hangover). I asked questions about it-nothing too prying, but he gave me general answers. Normally he tells me everything, specifics. Even if it's other people's private stuff (who am I going to tell? Plus that's what you do with your spouse). But he wouldn't this time and said it was because he didn't want to share his BFF's private stuff and he didn't want to rehash because he still felt raw. \n\nI totally get and respect that on a logical and mental level. I'm so glad he talked to me and to his BFF. I'm\nSo relieved he is feeling more like himself and is not keeping it in to the point where he is making himself physically ill. \n\nEmotionally is another story. It was hard enough yesterday during the first conversation to not take it personally that he was keeping all of this from me, didn't talk to me about his feelings or that he was getting physically ill. But I pushed it aside because it wasn't about me. I was quite proud of myself for that. Then today, just checking in and asking questions, he wouldn't share everything again. Like I said-logically I totally get and respect it. I didn't push. Emotionally I'm trying to not fall down the rabbit hole. I'm trying to not be paranoid, feel worthless, etc. but it's really fucking hard. This isn't who him and I are. We share. We don't hide. It's because of that (&amp; many other reasons) I feel safe with him. I did explain a lot of this to him (except the safety part- that I just realized). I've been careful to explain this to him in a way that acknowledges potential triggers with out putting those triggers on him. I'm so glad he's made a break through. I'm so glad he's letting me in to support him. I just emotionally feel like shit right now and I don't want to put it on him at all. ",

I'm trying my hardest to leave their influence on my life behind.\n\nBut one thing that I've identified about myself that I cannot destroy is a set of sexual kinks that now very obviously tie back to my physical and emotional abuse. Unfortunately those kinks have also been used as a means for past partners to sexually abuse me. And I really hate that part of myself. It's a reminder of how my parents got in my head and messed me up, and while I don't believe kinks are inherently bad, I feel like mine always beget pain when I'm with someone and regret when I'm not. They make me feel trapped in the role of a victim, and I really wish I could make them go away. But that's like wishing I could make the depression or the anxiety disorders go away. It's just a part of who I am as a result of my childhood.\n\nI guess I'm posting this on here because I don't really know who to turn to about this.

        "text": "Apparently realizing that my youngest GCbro is one of the very few biofamily with whom I speak, Nparents fed him a story about my beloved grandma going into sudden kidney failure. \n\nI speak with her every couple of days and so far as I knew, she had an ear infection... and that's still all it is, thus she was rather alarmed when I phoned in a panic about if I should hop on a plane urgently to see her.\n\nPhoning again today, gran says that my (to Nparents, an SG) uncle just had a nice vacation visit with her last week and just now left, so she feels perhaps Nparents were \"overly dramatic\" about her medical concerns.\n\nThus I ?d GCbro politely (Hey Gran's just got an ear infection is why she didn't answer her phone lately, also she says she didn't tell you directly it's kidney failure so how did that happen?) it turns out that indeed Gran did not speak to him directly, Ndad texted him.\n\nIt is all simply a creation of Nparents, with bonus triangulation of GCbro, who is visiting gran tomorrow and now feels thoroughly ridiculous about being played by Nparents just to get to me. \n\n(For those who missed the last Nparent attempt to suck me back in from NC, gran gave Nparents a family item to ship to me since she's in her 90s and not up for lugging furniture to FedEx - they promptly gave it to their current GC, aka Ncousin, who has kept it despite gran pleading with her to do the right thing and send it on to me.  Now the nursing home staff are on full alert when Nparents visit, as recently they've started in on Gran's jewelry - Ncousin is banned already.)\n\nAnd I feel ridiculous for not checking myself before panicking - again, something I always do professionally, but that I try not to be a paranoid asshole about in my private life - argh.\n\nI am changing my social media profile and scanning all remaining family members for being friends with Nparents and Nparents' known pseudonyms.  \n\nAnd, sadly, I'll need to rely on my Gran's nurses to tell me if there's a problem (knowing the family, they've promised to tell me) because youngest GCbro is no longer a reliable source.\n\nWhen even the most veteran nurses of end-of-life-care's family feuds are shocked at the Nparents' stooping to this level... :(\n\nCan I get a witness? Or a hug? :(",

        "text": "Parents are divorced and are both narcissists.  My spouse has met both of them, but I've been NC over 5 years for both except for an exceptional situation (you can see my post history).\n\nIf I get a moment these days and need to vent (even now!), my husband and I always discuss them by their first names.  I have 95% forgotten the terms of 'mom' and 'dad.'  \n\nIt's sometimes sad to know that I don't have those 'people' anymore, but I'm much happier now.  I'm still very close with my sister (she respects my boundaries), and I have slipped numerous times calling our parents by their names.  Then the other times I've been on point, I feel very strained saying 'mom' or 'dad.'  *Shivers*\n\nAnyone else?",

I know that I need to leave my current situation, but I am just worried that I won't see the red flags while interviewing housemate prospects and end up repeating the same mistake of choosing wrong housemates. I also worry that I won't find a new place on time, or I'll make a bad impression and they'll pick other people over me, all these anxieties.\n\nI just want a peaceful affordable place where I can decompress and not get drained from abrasive emotional vampires. sigh",
