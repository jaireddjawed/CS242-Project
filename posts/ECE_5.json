I was EE major, but the Electromagnetic course did not go well (I did not like it and eventually Q-dropped it), so I decided to transfer to CE to avoid Electromagnetic and Solid-State Device. Meanwhile, in my school, I still can take Analog Elective like Electronics Circuit and VLSI Circuit Design as CE. \n\nAfter researching more on this sub, I think I made a huge mistake switching to CE since I read that Electromagnetic and Solid-State Device are important for Analog.\n\nI have accepted an internship offer as Mix-Singal Design Engineer for next summer. I don't know if not having those two classes (Electromagnetic and Solid-State) will screw me up. I found YouTube playlist for those courses online. Can self-learn those courses online be fine?",

Grug no teach new thing, change old ways.\n\nOld spirit-talking vine from thirty winters ago. Spirit-talking vine controlled by big chief god, big blue ball. Blue ball bad, but blue ball indifferent. Grug help make changes through the winters. Grug make many many ritual and incantation and prayer. All this time, sacred number of spirit-talking vine remains same, travel through many god's domains. Some gods evil, some gods incompetent, some gods both. Grug finally bring sacred number to final resting place, voice of googles.\n\nGrug mix together a voodoo with eye phone, blue teeth, and a DECT base station with handsets. But it not sacred number. \"Grug just forward sacred number to new phone\" Grug not stupid but this no work. Relative must be able to pick up handset, dial, no ritual.\n\nAlso worse thing: Many many evil spirits call on sacred number, day and night. Number nearly older than Grug. Voice of googles only keep away one out of ten. Grug turn off all call forwarding, ring nowhere, but now no way to call screen. Many evil spirit call upon sacred number, leave silent message.\n\nGrug not done.\n\nGrug have Obi 202, won in battle. Grug buy Obi 212 from scalp man, pay many shiny beads. Scalp man send Grug Obi 202. Grug say, item significantly not as described. All beads come back. Grug get free Obi 212, scalp man give Grug many many curses. Grug laugh.\n\nGrug not ready plug Obi in. Grug know this work out of box, but not want subject relative to evil spirits. Grug want build phone tree. Grug wish to serenade evil spirits with sounds of shrieking monkeys.wav, but good spirits press 2, speak to relative. Relative not dumb-dumb, can handle if occasional sneaky spirit presses 2, but not want answer phone all time.\n\nGrug like rummage through garbage like raccoon, find \"56k USB modem\" at salvation military encampment and trash store. Grug pay one leaf then forget about modem, box go on collection of ancient technology. Grug originally think make magic lantern show of ancient things still in boxes, then out of boxes, but Grug drink much firewater and meet Gruggette.\n\nMaybe you say, \"Grug, usb modem is winmodem, linux not speak it tongue.\" It not winmodem, it say work Linux. Maybe you say, \"GRUG 56k DATA MODEM IS NOT VOICE CAPABLE BIG DUMMY\" but Grug see clear language indicating support for Digital Telephone Answering Sytem. Grug best kind of hunter: lucky kind.\n\nGrug plan following ritual:\n\nOBI-202 &gt; ??? &gt; DECT base station\n\nGrug find rasperry pi zero wh on shelf but Grug never use. Grug happy to plug old laptop up for time being, no need find mini HDMI vine.\n\nMaybe you say, \"Grug just get cheap ATA\" maybe that fine maybe Grug grudgingly do that but Grug not see point, when Obi do all relevant work and all Grug need is glorified answering machine pass through.",

I am only electrician at the company, so I shouldn't do it, because I am still \"young\", but it was needed to...\n\nSo I am more and more inclined to find a job, that would be more like it, to repair things, to learn more about electronics, which my job wouldn't allow thanks to amount of time, that I have...\n\nThere is a hurdle, I am a student at University ( Electronics and Communication Systems) it is distance learning, so I have usually from Monday to Thursday work and Friday school. \n\nWhat positions would I have on the market ? I am fine with a wage as normal worker and having Friday + weekend for university. I was at Law School after high school ( Electrotechnics ), but I drop out, I wasn't just for me. Last years I started working as Test Engineer and started studying to know at least basic stuff about electronics repair and motor controls and a bit of PLC, but it is just a basics and a bit more, but I need still time to be more proficient, which would allow me a different job, where would I have time to do this type of stuff.\n\nIt seems that Technicians are rather scarce, that I would have rather a good chance to find a good job.

It had two answers on each side of a slider and you had the options of slightly agree or agree on both sides, you could not put the slider in the middle you just had to select one or the other. Now these would be easy for me if the questions were like \"I don't like to work in groups\" vs \"I love a challenge\". Easy i would go strongly agree \"I love a challenge\". Bruh, These questions were crazy. To paraphrase one question was like \"I don't feel bad about people who don't have much in life\" vs \"It is not wise to try to do a task you already made a mistake in\". How in the world do I answer that? Why do i have to do this? lmao. I went with the not feeling bad option but I mean of course I think both things are awful. Any feedback? I ended up failing the assessment and now can't interview for this position so I really need to get good at this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: How to answer personality/behavior assessments when the questions have options to choose from that are both horrible. e.g.  \"I don't feel bad about people who don't have much in life\" vs \"It is not wise to try to do a task you already made a mistake in\".",

I've worked with the diode in LTSpice and the manufacturer's model is surprisingly good in terms matching physical measurements at high frequency (&gt;500MHz). The problem is that their provided model is encrypted. When I try to import into ADS, regardless of whether I try PSpice or HSpice or LTSpice options, I get a whole bunch of 'internal' components, most of which are SDD2P elements. What I don't get are any device ports and that's the obvious first problem. Can't do anything without ports to connect to and I get a ghostbuster 'no port' generic symbol for the imported device. I've tried reasoning out the netlist from all the internal components that are generated, but honestly it seems like there are way too many components for a Schottky diode. Would expect to see a handful, maybe up to a dozen depending on how they are modeling the device, but not 60 disparate components. So no ports is an obvious problem, but I feel like I'm just getting garbage out in general.\n\nI'm trying to import as schematic, but I've tried importing as netlist and I get a ton of 'skipping unrecognized element' for various lines of encrypted hex. I've tried setting the 'reference technology definition' option to within the .lib file I'm importing, but it says there are no units defined in the file. I've also tried using HSpice import 'wizard' and didn't get any further with that. I have reached out to the device manufacturer's technical support and gotten no response.\n\nHere is the model I am trying to use in ADS. It's a SiC Schottky from GeneSic. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n[https://genesicsemi.com/sic-schottky-mps/GB02SLT12-214/GB02SLT12-214\\_SPICE.zip](https://genesicsemi.com/sic-schottky-mps/GB02SLT12-214/GB02SLT12-214_SPICE.zip)",

Should I just poll this? The only thing I'm worried about is that I feel like when i just add more if statements to my code, it's somehow convoluting the process.\n\nAlso worth noting that my project isn't doing anything too complex, i just have a timer that will send a DC signal when a certain amount of time is reached, and the button pauses or resets the timer.\n\nThank you in advance.",

        "text": "I have come across a similar need/interest in various amateur projects, and am stuck in how to approach it most effectively, or where to look for further information/education;\n\n1) I've bought several cheap soundcards and microphones, and have attempted various experiments where I record the same sounds from them all simultaneously, but have discovered that their sample rate varies ever so slightly, and varies by time; a loud sound from the same location twice in a row will show up as a different interval (in number of samples) among the sound cards even if configured identically, and the variation is different if I try the experiment several times. How can I analyze in what manner the sample rate varies? Especially without a reference sound (sine generator/tuning fork) available that I trust to not have more variation?\n\n2) I have two pictures of a wavy curtain lit by ambient light, taken some distance apart horizontally. The curtain has an abstract, non-repeating artistic pattern that is pretty noisy on it. Can I recover the 3d information of how the curtain is hung by the parallax between the cameras in an effective way? Especially without a separate step of analyzing the pattern for identifying marks in the two pictures to correlate.\n\n3) Assuming I've figured out problem 1, or gotten better sound cards, if I spread the microphones out across the room, can I track where in the room my voice is coming from as I walk around talking, especially my velocity, without making presumptions about loudness and accoustics, just from the varying dopplering relative to the different microphones? Specifically, how do I figure out the difference in dopplering between two microphones in a computationally efficient manner?\n\nThese problems all seem to be abstractable to the same mathematics after I've used the methods I already know:\n\nI have N different devices sampling the same source F, and this translates to (ignoring noise) several functions S_n(t)=F(G_n(t)) for n in N, where F is the same across them and there are significant constraints on each of the G_n's - e.g. G is always monotonic, G is close to continuous and has reasonable bounds on its derivative, etc., and I want to recover each G_n using S_n and the knowledge that F is common.\n\nBut I don't know how to solve this kind of problem effectively, and do not know the term for this kind of analysis, if there is any, to search for it. What methods are used in these kind of problems? Where do I look for more information? \nFor background I'm 44 years old without any formal training in ECE, can at least read and understand some mathematics in the fields of calculus and linear algebra, can write and use fourier transforms (FFT and more tailored/expensive versions of my own for particular purposes), and can at least think of a few ways to theoretically solve this problem slowly and inefficiently, but I'm looking for better/to learn. I'm not going back to school at my age, but I might pick up a text book if it has information about these things, and I can read academic papers if necessary.

My goal is to become either a software engineer or computer engineer at a big tech/computer company such as NVIDIA. \n\nSo far I’ve been really enjoying my computer science courses and been loving the aspects of programming. I’ve even been able to secure a software engineering internship for the summer. However, a part of me feels like I could accomplish my goals as an electrical engineering major, as well as have more opportunities to explore when I graduate (I could also call myself an engineer). I also have strong interest in computer hardware. But the other part of me really enjoys the CS major topics and classes a bit more, so it has left me at a crossroads. \n\nI would totally major in computer engineering, but my university is not ABET accredited in computer engineering, it is however accredited in EE. \nDoes anyone have any advice?",

I know some C and Python and I am learning Data Structures and Algorithms now, after which I will learn C++ and networking. I also do some things with hardware, for example I plan on trying to repair my old monitor (the backlight died and there are bad capacitors on the power supply board, if I am correct). Also, my grandfather was an electrician, so I guess it's a family thing (yes, I know electrician != EE).\n\n**What I want:**\n\nI want to double major, because education is free in my country and why not, if the courses overlap enough, more knowledge is better in my opinion. \n\n**What is my plan:**\n\nI am thinking about doing an Electronics and Telecommunications degree first, which is something like CE degree in the US (there is no CE per say in my country, but this degree is the closest), there is about 65% EE and 35% CS, besides Maths and Physics. You learn about Analog Circuits, Digital Circuits, Microprocessors, Signal theory, Python, C, C++, Assembly, VHDL, Verilog, Embedded, IoT, Network Programming, Operating systems, Antennas and so on. \n\nThen halfway through the degree, I would like to start another one that is related to it. I can choose either EE or CS (maybe there are some other options ?). The CS degree is not really that appealing (Java, C#, webdev and so on, which I can as well learn on my own, on top of that, I will have a lot of programming courses during the CE degree), although I have friends who have CS degrees and work as webdevs (mostly frontend) and they say that I should exclusively do CS degree, the thing is that they don't like hardware, hence why I still think that EE + CE would be a better choice.\n\nI don't care about earning X more doing thing A instead of thing B (the pay differences are often negligible). I definitely like CE more, but it's not like I hate CS, I could do either. And I presume that it's not difficult to switch from hardware to software, the other way around definitely is tougher.\n\nWhat do you think ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd about the last question, here are my core Math courses (EE, CS, CE, doesn't matter):\n\n1)Calc 1 (1st semester)\n\n2)Calc 2 (2nd semester)\n\n3)Linear Algebra (1st semester)\n\n4)Intro to Probability and Statistics (3rd semester)\n\nI have no idea about Physics  courses though.",

        "text": "I'm a technician at a very small engineering company, and today my boss assigned me with the task of finding out the limitations of our oscilloscopes, i.e. finding the frequency at which the signal begins to attenuate, then he wants me to write a report about it.  Most of our scopes are rated at 300 MHz and we only have one signal generator there that only goes up to 100 MHz, so I can't even reach the rated limit of most of the scopes.  And we have a scope that goes up to 2 GHz, how do I even get a signal that high?  And wouldn't it be dangerous to push the scopes to the limit, or at the least damage them?  How do I even accomplish this.\n\nI am not even sure what I am asking.  I am just flabbergasted at this assignment and wanted to share.",

In our field promotional raises are very small and we make about 120-150 k after 10-15 years in the industry. Electrical engineering really fascinates me . For example the control that are used to control aerospace structures, robotics and machine learning algorithm use in cell phone and other novel cause really interest me. I also think ECE engineers starts making good salary after only 2-3 years in the industry. Do you guys think I should go back to school to get a masters in ECE working part time as a civil engineer? Is it worth it now to do ece? Or ece is saturated now and the pay grade is not good enough? What kind of masters specialization should I do if you guys think its worth it ? Thank you",

        "text": "Some quick background info. I just finished my BS in EE and am on the hunt for my first job. I had a Summer internship but for outside reasons, I had to quit it 2 weeks in so it's not on my resume and basically, I have no engineering work experience. I've been working full-time as a medical assistant while in school. Before going back to school I ran restaurants for about 10 years. My GPA finished off at 3.14 so nothing too great. I'm in my early 30s. An average entry-level salary for my area is $60k + benefits.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so I want to get into medical device research and design as an end career goal. I know I won't jump into that role right out of school with no experience. That's fine, I want to gain as much experience and learn as much as I can. It's looking like I'm going to have the choice of two offers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) As a repair/test technician working for a company that designs medical equipment. Since I don't have the experience I won't be starting out as an engineer and it will be a 6-month contract. After 6 months they'll either fire me or extend me a permanent role. I've been told they like to promote from within and this path could lead me to a design job later down the road. It'll be full-time at $25/hour\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) As a transmission line engineer for a power company. I'll start out as an engineer, but doing something I have very little interest in. My internship was in power and after 2 weeks I was thankful I had to quit because it was so boring. That said, I'll be starting out as an engineer instead of having to work my way up and the pay is $60k/year so almost $10k more a year. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty broke now so more money sooner is definitely nice. I have a BS in psychology from my early 20s and those student loans plus my EE student loans had me max out my federal loans so for the past two years I've been paying for school out of pocket and now at this point I'm a month or so behind on bills and about $10,000 in CC debt. I'm afraid that if I take option 2 I'll get all my experience in the wrong field and will have a hard time moving to design later. That said, I'm scared that if I take option 1 I'll get stuck as a technician and not be able to move up to an engineer. Any and all input is wanted and greatly appreciated. I know the end choice is mine but it's nice to hear opinions. Thank you!",

        "text": "Hey all - \n\nI have set up a very simple problem in HFSS: monostatic RCS from a perfectly conducting sphere. Most studies of this kind look at RCS as a function of sphere size. I want to do something EVEN SIMPLER: just look at RCS as a function of azimuthal angle, phi. Should look the same from every direction, right? Well, when I run an SBR+ model I get what I expect, constant RCS over phi. When I run the FEM model (using both Radiation boundaries and PML boundaries) I get...not that. I get something that looks like trash and varies by up to 10s of dB. Making a finer mesh or curvilinear mesh does not improve things much. \n\nPlease let me know if there is a better subreddit to ask, but I was wondering if anyone else has seen this issue or can possibly run a quick verification of this calculation. I'm pretty flummoxed on this one.",

Both have good pay and are in my field of interest. Location isn't an issue. My no 1 goal is to build a good resume so that I have a solid chance in Boeing when I graduate or during my senior year. \n\nI guess the main reason my choice isn't obvious is that while interviewing with both companies, the big company made me feel like an object, like I am part of the process, and feels very robotic. While the not-so-big big company made me feel more personal, they shared the company's vision with me and made me feel more welcomed and personal. But still, for me, my self-interest should come before the company's mission isn't it.\n\nAs the first internship, which one would have a better impact on my career? \n\nOne of my many thoughts is to go with the more well-known company, keep in touch (LinkedIn and career fair) with the other company, and when I am done with building my resume with the better-known company, apply for the other one.",
