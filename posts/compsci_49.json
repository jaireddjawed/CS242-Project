The deterministic verifier version of the definition of NP just says that for any language L in NP there exists a polynomial-length certificate u as well as a polynomial-time verifier machine M that takes the input x and the certificate u and outputs 1 if and only if x is in L. The definition makes no statements about how easy it is to compute the string representation of the verifier machine M, or to find out what the polynomial describing the length of the certificate. Without this information, how can we ensure that we can compute the required arguments for TMSAT for any NP language in polynomial time?",

I realize going from acting to computer science is an incredibly drastic change, but I have always been interested in computers and technology and have been researching different majors and have come to the conclusion that Computer Science is the most appealing thing to me. Though the math is daunting I believe that if I apply myself I can do anything. However I am wondering if 28 is too old to go back to school for something I have virtually no experience with (though I have a lot of interest in it) and if by the time I get my bachelors (I should be 30-31) I would be too far behind to build a decent career out of it for the rest of my life.

Eventually, the idea of a \"reverse\" L-system occurred to me, where an image could be provided as input, and a set of rules representing a \"best fit\" L-system could be returned. Perhaps you could provide a picture of a tree (I'd think the background would have to be incredibly minimal), and the output would describe an L-system that could retrace the trunk and branch formation (to an extent, maybe dictated by a maximum number of iterations?).\n\nGiven my undergrad experience in CS, plus my whole two days of experience with L-systems, this strikes me as being phenomenally complex. But I was wondering if any people with actual experience in this area have ever considered or attempted such a thing (and if so, if it has a name other than \"Reverse L-system\".)",

        "text": "Hi there so I am starting a computer science degree in a few months, and I have some time to kill wondered what everyone would recommend learning before I start.\n\nI had been teaching myself python but I decided to leave it and start CS50, I've just finished week 4 and I'm enjoying it enough, but I wonder if this is the best use of my time before I start? Part of me just wants to go back to python to delve into my own projects.\n\nI have been out of school for a good few years so I'm not sure how much of it I will remember. I've read brushing up on my maths would be a good idea, what are some good topics to start on?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.",
