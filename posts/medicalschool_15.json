        "text": "Last year i had a very awful experience with a physician. I came in for a bad headache and also some partial vision issue when i get up which makes me lightheaded. One part i was still trying understand was when i first came in to see him, he asked me why i came today, not yesterday and if i had this issue for so long why did i choose this day to come. Every time i answered him and told him i had a headache and tried to explain he would cut me off and repeat the question saying but why today? He would say i know headache but why today‚Ä¶..It went on almost 10 times that it was so frustrating because he kept on cutting me off. I didn‚Äôt even get to 3 words across. He also said since i has this since i was in primary school how did I manage it? His information was incorrect as i only has it when i was in secondary school but when i corrected him he just shrugged his shoulders as if he didn‚Äôt care. Then why ask? My question is what is this doctor trying to ask me? Is such a question very important to a physician that they require knowledge of and does it even matter? Because what matters is me the fact that im there trying to get help rather than not right? Please help me have a clear understanding. Thanks üôè",

        "text": "\nI'm an M1, and for the first time since med school started I feel like I'm gonna make it. My first quarter was chaotic, I needed to adjust back to school and to living on my own, and it was a huge struggle to keep my head above water for most of that time. But I've been +/- 5 points of the exam average since December, without having to work very hard, and I feel like I've got my study life down. A lot of my classmates have joined interest groups and got research for the summer, I didn't feel like I had the headspace to do anything other than try to pass my classes until now, and I'd like some of your input on where to direct my energy.\n\nOne of the better things about having pre-medical school workplace experience is learning about yourself. I've worked a few jobs before medical school, some of them were boring. It really didn't bother me; as long as the paycheck was steady and the hours/labor wasn't abusive I really don't care. I can have plenty of interesting things outside of work. For that reason, I don't think I'd have a problem pursuing a specialty others might rule out as boring, like path. The only thing I'd rule out is primary care; my only shadowing experience has been primary care, and it wasn't for me. Nothing against primary care, but I'd like to be more specialized.\n\nI don't care about prestige, and I don't care about quality of patient interactions. The only things I care about for long term is lifestyle and compensation. Lifestyle wise I'd like to have a reasonable residency (as reasonable as residency gets), and then after that be able to see my kids grow up and be a part of their lives. Compensation wise, I live on a shoestring budget now and I'm happy, but I'd like to be able to give my kids more than I had growing up, so let's say around the median non-competitive specialty salary (based on the last chart I saw here that seems to be around 280-320k). \n\nTLDR; looking for something fairly well compensated with a decent work life balance, non-competitive specialty, hopefully humane residency. Don't care about prestige.\n\nIdeally this would be something slept on by everyone else so it's not too competitive, but I know it's impossible to predict what will happen 3 years from now. Right now I'm interested in anaesthesia, PM&amp;R and maybe rads, but these are just based on interactions here and with fellow med students, most of whom probably don't know what it's actually like. Based on my criteria, am I off base with those 3? Is there something else I should look at?",

The hosting hospital doesn't need to provide any grant to me or insurance. My University will provide them to me. \n\nI would be glad if you could provide me with the essential informations.\n\nGreetings, X",

Fantastic, I'll have my school pull the letter from ERAS and use that! Oh wait. Not an option.\n\nEmail the surgeon explaining the situation, asking to forward the same letter to the school so they can upload it to VSLO. No response, but not a big deal, I didn't get a response when I sent the documents for ERAS upload and it was the holidays. \n\nEmail my school (1 month later) asking if they received this letter. No, no they have not. Fantastic news.\n\nI email the surgeon AGAIN asking for the letter to be forwarded to my school. Now I assume it will happen, no big events going on, no excuse to not forward the SAME DAMN LETTER.\n\nApply for VSLO rotations with dates opening up this summer. Get an email from my school asking if i have a LOR because one of the programs is asking for it, even though they didn't have it as a required document. I'm like \"oh you don't have this one?\" No, no they do not.\n\nCut to me literally calling VSLO customer support asking if they can take the letter out of ERAS and put it on VSLO, it's all AAMC right? Surely this is possible!\n\nNo. No it is not.\n\nWhy is this process so convoluted? If i didn't have to \"waive my right\" to see the LOR in the first place, i could have it on my laptop ready to go. But nooooo, virtue signaling or some bullshit. \n\nJust needed to vent about it all, there isn't really anything I can do at this point anyway. \n\nTldr: if you request a LOR in your third year, make sure they send it to your school as well as ERAS when you request it",

I've always been a strong standardized test taker and have been doing well in classes this year (even though my preclinicals are unranked p/f so it doesn't matter), but I understand that step is another beast. Does anyone have any advice or insight? Obviously, time is precious and limited so if I have free time for shadowing/research I just want to make sure its intentional and productive",

Up until now, I was pretty set on Anesthesiology cause it's the only field that interested me but I am on my last rotation right now (Psych) and I've enjoyed this rotation a lot too. I've found this field really interesting too. So I'm not sure what to do. I've already applied for AIs/Aways for Anesthesia so I just want to get some of your thoughts. Here are the pros/cons I have for each.\n\nAnesthesia\n\nPros:  \n\\-Find physiology really interesting  \n\\-hands-on work  \n\\-great pay  \n\\-have done some anesthesia research  \n\\-can start my own clinic if I get into pain fellowship  \n\\-shift-work so don't have to worry about anything outside of my shifts  \n\\-Minimal documentation  \n\\-Could potentially work fewer hours for less pay (and still get paid as much or more than psychiatrist)  \nCons:  \n\\-IM/Surg Intern year will be rough  \n\\-Won't know how competitive I am until after Step 2  \n\\-Don't know how CRNA/AA stuff will work out. Will Anesthesiologists be in less demand? Will pay go down?  \n\\-Toxic OR culture (especially having to work alongside surgeons)\n\nPsych\n\nPros:  \n\\-Find psych interesting as well  \n\\-No IM/Surg Intern year  \n\\-More chill residency with less on call  \n\\-Less hours  \n\\-Potentially could work remotely after residency  \n\\-Easier to match into\n\nCons:  \n\\-Much lower pay  \n\\-Stigma of going into psych  \n\\-Fewer challenges/less stimulating work  \n\\-Long notes/detailed documentation for each patient\n\nThese are just some thoughts I've had so far. Would love to hear from others who are either in these fields or considering them!",

(I also like cardiology for the pathology research but I feel I could help many people in psychiatry, and I love that). So do you see it feasible to do Pathology and study psychoanalysis on the other side, and being able to manage to combine both into daily life? I think pathologists are really creative and sensitive and curious people, so I guess some pathologist have studied another thing in addition to pathology. I don't know if you have any idea or know some cases that could orientate me better. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

Only a first year so have no real research experience to contribute.\n\n*Am being asked to participate in the study (very easy nutritional study). Not hard at all but uncertain if I was asked to fill a quota/if I will be significantly involved in the analysis portion.\n\nLab 2:\n\n*Very small lab, PI JUST started/moved his lab from the Oxbridge to an Ivy League (where i will be doing my research).\n\n*H-index of 10, doesn't publish nearly as consistently. However, I would assume it's due to his recent promotion to assistant prof?\n\n*Unsure about publishing (have not asked directly, but does seem receptive)\n\n*Seems much happier to train a beginning researcher on methods, projects etc. Seems like a kind PI and would be able to make a meaningful relationship with (and get a good LOR etc)\n\n*Will have to pay for accom/live in a new area of the US, however nice to connect and meet others.\n\nI may be able to do an option of Lab 1 being virtual and Lab 2 being in person, but I would assume that sacrifices any chance of getting a publication at Lab 1.
