        "text": "This study explores the concern in Epicureanism to create brief renderings of its philosophical tenets. It is argued that although the Epicureans were characteristically apprehensive about simplifying their philosophy so that it would appeal to a broad audience, they utilized literary formats such as epitomes to allow new students and well-disposed outsiders to gain an overview of the philosophy. From around 150–50 BCE evidence though emerges that some Epicureans produced heavily abridged and simplistic texts in order to promote the philosophy widely and to ease the induction of new recruits into the school. This study allows the character and intentions of this largely forgotten movement to emerge, and the potential this has for aiding our understanding of the dissemination of philosophy and intellectual ideas in antiquity to be highlighted.\n\nhttps://www.academia.edu/12472017/_Epitomizing_Philosophy_and_the_Critique_of_Epicurean_Popularizers_Journal_of_Ancient_History_3.1_2015_22-54",

        "text": "I've been reading two books on Stoicism, one about how to adopt it as a \"philosophy of life\" and one about it's connection to modern CBT practices. I've also started reading Aurelius' Meditations, which does give some good advice too. I've found all of them interesting and full of good advice on how to live life, but I can't help but feel that I'm not entirely convinced by some of the Stoic arguments. \n\n**So I was wondering: are there any good books on Epicureanism as a philosophy of life? Simply put, how does one practice Epicureanism? \n**\nI'm reading \"Epicureanism - A very short introduction\" by Catherine Wilson right now and I think it's very interesting, especially the Epicurean materialism and it's connection to the Renaissance and modern science. But it hasn't really got that \"philosophy of life\"-vibe that I'm looking for.\n\nI've looked at the book recommendations post but I don't feel like delving into all the primary sources. As for Stoicism, Aurelius \"Meditations\" has been interesting (I haven't read much) because it has a lot of advice on how to live a good life even if I find the language a bit strained (english is not my mother tongue), so if there is some sort of Epicurean counterpart to \"Meditations\" I would happy to read it.\n\n**Simply put, I'm not out to read all the primary sources, I'm not even out to call my self a Epicurean - I'm trying to adopt some kind of philosophy of life based in part on ancient advice. \n**\nAnyone have any recommendations?\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Thank you to all involved on this sub for providing a solid place to learn about Epicureanism. Some Reddit subs  portray things inaccurately, but this seems like a very clear, levelheaded place to discuss ideas. I just wanted to express how Epicureanism has been fitting into my life now that I've discovered a title for some things I've perhaps known internally but needed framing. Feel free to comment on any aspect of my thinking below! In particular you may find my idea of Epicureanism as a framework for all other pursuits/thinking to be attached as an interesting take. \n\nTake care all!\n___________\n\nMany times I have tried to pin down what I’m all about. What’s the main thing I’m into? What describes me best? I would mention “trying to live really well,” “life enthusiast,” “doing things in the best way,” but never really considered that I could just call myself a philosopher. That title gets a bad rap. It conjures up images of  misanthropes who think they’re better than others, believe they’re quite the intellectual. Really philosophy only means a lover of wisdom. So I’ll call myself a philosopher because the main pursuit of my life has been finding wisdom.\n\nIt’s interesting how Stoicism, Epicureanism, and the Dhamma relate and interact. Certain aspects of each are shared in the other, and each has various bits that I apply to my life at various times. The one that matches my disposition the most is Epicureanism. It values mental pleasure over physical, friendship and community, simple living, balance between desire and rationality (one can lean heavily toward restraint). I think simplifying is very good to do– to be content with less is important, finding joy in little things rather than consumption. At the same time, Epicureanism doesn’t ask me to forgo every mental desire/pleasure that exists like the Dhamma does. Perhaps one day I will know whether I could extend that forgoing indefinitely like the Dhamma asks.\n\nAt any rate, Epicureanism is a good starting model for living a healthy lay life. I don’t think one can properly follow the Dhamma and still do a good job at being a leader, musician, performer, educator as I am. One needs to be cloistered away in order to do well at dropping all desire. That process of contemplation really gets in the way of doing what people and the world expect me to do. It can help, but a full devotion to it mucks it up.\n\nPerhaps I can consider that philosophy, music, education are all things that are quite noble as a pursuit. But even nobler would be one day to transcend those as well. After all, ideas are moldable, changing; they’re just models. Sometimes you can change a factor and the whole thing falls down or you just glue it together with another idea. Experiential knowledge would then be the only real knowledge– thus Buddhism.\n\nStoicism certainly has some ties to Buddhism in the way that pleasure and pain are indifferents, and that the best good is to be virtuous (skillful), to control that one thing we have control over: our actions. Stoicism adds a great impetus to doing great work as well: part of being virtuous is doing our very best work in whatever we do. To fulfill our role. In doing that we fulfill phusis, or nature’s tendency to move toward perfection. We are great not to be great, but because it is part of fulfilling that ultimate good.\n\nI would imagine that Epicureanism is a framework, and to that framework (one that I’ve already naturally inclined towards) I can then attach anything and everything to it that will also help me achieve mental ease. Absorb what is useful. Either that, or one day continue exploring the limits of my renunciation, or pursue a different explanation of the Dhamma altogether. Whatever I decide to do, for now I will read some Nietzsche.\n\n______\n\nDoes anyone else experience this rub between practicing Buddhism and living lay life? Do you think Epicureanism is a good \"in between\" that captures the best wisdom for how to live life? So far it really explains a lot for me and gives me a viable alternative to Buddhism if I feel that won't work for me. \n",

        "text": "I've been interested in epicureanism for a while and just came across this sub because of the ad in the sidebar. \n\nI was reading through some of the posts and I think a lot of people are incorrectly associating epicureanism with aspects of hedonism in essentially saying that pleasure is the greatest good and thus to feel free to self-indulge in whatever provides you the most pleasure. This is decidedly not what epicureanism is about. Epicureanism is about seeking pleasure through minimizing suffering. Epicurus states throughout his writings that it is only through living modestly and taking enjoyment in a variety of activities that pleasure and contentment can be maximized. Overindulgence leads to suffering. \n\nEpicurus was a proponent of the \"golden mean\" (different from the golden ratio in mathematics if you decide to google) which means balancing various sources of peace and pleasure, such as eating, drinking, socialization, privacy, etc. Furthermore, Epicurus exalted psychological well being and intrinsic enjoyment as paramount over materialism, lust, and partying. Epicurus himself never married and avoided romantic relationships because according to him, these would inevitably result in suffering of some kind. Epicurus saw the path to an ideal life not as engaging in things that involve more pleasure than suffering, but completely removing himself from anything that could potentially cause him suffering. The focus in Epicurean belief is to minimize anxiety and suffering and to seek knowledge that helps minimize such suffering (such as knowledge that helps one avoid fear of death). However, too much knowledge and thinking could cause one suffering (as it did in many Greek philosophers) and thus he thought it was also important to avoid becoming too philosophical or questioning, again exemplifying the golden mean. In Epicureanism, pleasure is the absence of suffering. \n\nEpicureanism is certainly a cool philosophy, but make sure you know what it's about before jumping completely on board and saying you believe in the Epicurean doctrine. I personally agree with many components of Epicureanism without completely subscribing to the theory as a way of life, as I think some degree of suffering is not only inevitable, but necessary to live a good life. Please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this, but I'm pretty sure this is essentially what Epicurus is talking about in his poetry and writings. ",

Sometimes just thinking about those moments gets me feeling reflective and grateful for what I have and the people around me.

        "text": "There are a few papers and books out there that remark on the similarities between Epicureanism and the philosophy to be found in the Book of Ecclesiastes. Epicurus not being particularly beloved by those religions which hold the bible holy this seems a strange idea. [So I gave it a read](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+1&amp;version=KJV) and there are many passages which seem to echo Epicurean thought. \n\nThere is debate about the composition date and location of the Book of Ecclesiastes. The presence of loan words from Persian place it after the 6th century BCE, and the first historical comment on it place it no later than the 2nd century BCE. If written later in that time period then the conquests of Alexander could well have spread Epicureanism with the other trappings of Hellenism.\n\nHere are the sections I found had some resonance to Epicurus, and which seem to sit ill at ease with the rest of the bible.\n\n\n**Ecclesiastes 1:\n14** - I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.\n\n**Ecclesiastes 2: \n5** I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:\n6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees:\n7 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:\n8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.\n9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.\n10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.\n11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.\n12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been already done.\n13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.\n14 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all.\n15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.\n16 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.\n17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.\n18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.\n19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.\n20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which I took under the sun.\n21 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.\n22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?\n23 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.\n24 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.\n\n**Ecclesiastes 3:\n12** I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.\n13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God...\n19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity...  \n20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.\n21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?\n22 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?\n\n**Ecclesiastes 4:\n6** Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit...  \n9 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.\n10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up.\n11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?\n12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.\n13 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.\n\n**Ecclesiastes 5:\n10** He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.\n11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?\n12 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.\n13 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.\n14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and there is nothing in his hand.\n15 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand...  \n18 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.\n\n\n**Ecclesiastes 8:\n15** Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.\n\n**Ecclesiastes 9: 2** All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath...  \n4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.\n5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.\n6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.\n7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works...  \n9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.\n\n**Ecclesiastes 10:\n4** If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.",

        "text": "Epicureanism is an expansive philosophical school with teachings on subjects as diverse as atomic theory, meteorology, metaphysics, theology, and ethics. While all these are interesting to the student of philosophy it is in the ability of Epicureanism to improve our lives today which hakes it worth studying.\n\tUnfortunately there are two, diametrically opposed, misunderstandings commonly held about what Epicurus taught which need to be addressed.\n\n**A life simply of pleasure**\n\nThe most widely made mistake is that Epicurus was an unbridled hedonist who thought any and all pleasure was worth pursuing. There was a school which taught this in the ancient world: the Cyrenaics. In part Epicurus was writing against this school. Lumping him with them was an attack made even in his lifetime and has continued ever since.\n\nIn fact many fragments that we have from the works of Epicurus clearly demonstrate that not all pleasures were worth seeking out.\n\n&gt; It is better to endure particular pains which produce greater satisfactions that we may enjoy. It is well to abstain from particular pleasures which produce more severe pains so that we may not suffer them.\n\n&gt; **Fragment from Ethics**\n\nThis means that we have to consider each thing in itself and the consequences attached to it. One glass of wine may be good for conversation and happiness and health, with very little risk of a hangover. A couple of bottles probably produces a short lived euphoria and a longer lived hangover, and then painful memories. The euphoria may be intense, a greater pleasure, but the pains associated with it make overindulgence far too costly.\n\nThe same is true of pain. We all flinch naturally away from pain just as we tend towards pleasure. I dislike the pain of injections but I know that the small pain now prevents a much larger pain later from illness. I hate being taught, but I like the later pleasure of knowing things so I sit through lessons. I undergo a pain for a larger pleasure.\n\nSo with an Epicurean view of pleasure and pain what sort of life should we lead?\n\n&gt; Of our desires some are natural and necessary, others are natural but not necessary; and others are neither natural nor necessary, but are due to groundless opinion.\n\n&gt; **Principal Doctrine 29**\n\nEpicurus can be seen as a philosopher of the simple life. He split our desires into three categories. The first, those that are natural and necessary, are the ones which we cannot do without. We need food, we need water. Going without them causes pain so it is useless to struggle with ourselves against these desires.\n\nThe third type of desire, the unnatural and the unnecessary, are the ones we can cut out entirely without causing any pain and probably increasing our pleasure. Many addictive things come from this category. Caffeine or nicotine. You have to accustom your body to them to even want them.\n\nThe second category is the one where we have individual choices to make. Being evolved creatures we have desires which are natural but unnecessary. Luckily we also have minds. We can judge which desires should be played out and which denied based on our reasoning out the consequences. \n\t\n&gt; If you wish to make Pythocles rich, do not give him more money, but diminish his desire.\n\n&gt; **Letter to Ideomenus**\n\nUnfulfilled desires are painful. Getting into simple habits is one way of avoiding these pains. \n\n&gt; Nothing is enough to someone for whom what is enough is little.\n\n&gt; **Vatican Saying 68**\n\nWhen we read Epicurus or Lucretius it is clear that we are exhorted to be rid of extraneous things. Surely this makes him the philosopher of the simple life? Unfortunately it is not that simple.\n\n**Epicurus was not a pseudo-Buddha**\n\nThe second trap that people reading about Epicurus fall into is the opposite of the hedonistic one. They read quotes such as-\n\n&gt; Happiness and blessedness do not correlate with abundance of riches, exalted positions, or offices or power, but with freedom from pain and gentleness of feeling and a state of mind that sets limits that are in accordance with nature.\n\n&gt; **From Cyril Bailey’s translation of fragments**\n\nOr...\n\n&gt; The magnitude of pleasure reaches its limit in the removal of all pain.\n\n&gt;**Principal Doctrine 3**\n\nOr...\n\n&gt; It is better for you to be free of fear lying upon a bed of straw, than to have a golden couch and a lavish table and be full of trouble.\n\n&gt; **Letter Fragment**\n\nThey assume that Epicurus thought that the ultimate pleasure was the complete removal of pain. This is at best a partially correct reading. All Epicurus meant was that we can only reach our maximum amount of pleasure when we have no pain, not that the state of being free of pain was itself the highest pleasure. This is just common sense; even the best day of your life would be spoiled by a toothache. That does not mean everyone without a toothache is blissfully happy.\n\nWhat Epicurus taught was that life should be as simple as possible, and no simpler. \n\t\n&gt; There is also a limit in simple living, and he who fails to understand this falls into an error as great as that of the man who gives way to extravagance.\n\n&gt; **Vatican Saying 63**\n\nThe Cynic Diogenes tried to live as simply as possible. He lived in a tub which he rolled about Athens, defecated in the street, and masturbated in the agora. A pretty simple life, if not pretty in the details. One day when he was drinking from a clay cup he saw a child using their hand to scoop up water. He threw his cup away realising he could do without it.\n\nThis is the danger of exalting the simple life too extremely. Yes, we can do without many things. But if going without a cup, or a home, or a toilet, or masturbatorium, causes us more pain than having them what have we proved? \n\n**The Epicurean way**\n\n&gt; What is good is easy to get.\n\n&gt; **Tetrapharmakos**\n\nEpicurus is a complex philosopher because he did not lay down any one single way to live for all his followers. Pleasure is as individual as the people experiencing it. Thomas Jefferson gives a concise description of the Epicurean ideal for moving through life.\n\n&gt; Everything in this world is a matter of calculation. Advance then with caution, the balance in your hand. Put into one scale the pleasures which any object may offer; but put fairly into the other the pains which are to follow, &amp; see which preponderates… Do not bite at the bait of pleasure till you know there is no hook beneath it. The art of life is the art of avoiding pain: &amp; he is the best pilot who steers clearest of the rocks &amp; shoals with which he is beset.\n\n&gt; **Thomas Jefferson, Letter To Ezra Stiles Paris, Sep. 1, 1786**\n\nThe injunctions Epicurus left will tend towards a simple life, but one must remember that the aim is simplicity to maximise pleasure. We should not sacrifice pleasure for the sake of simplicity.\n\n&gt; We think highly of frugality not that we may always keep to a cheap and simple diet, but as a means to keep us free from hunger.\n\n&gt; **Letter to Ideomenus**\n \n&gt; The wealth required by nature is limited and is easy to procure; but the wealth required by vain ideals extends to infinity.\n\n&gt; **Principal Doctrine 15**\n \n&gt; Don't spoil what you have by desiring what you don't have; but remember that what you now have was once among the things only hoped for.\n\n&gt; **Vatican Saying 35**\n \n&gt; Freedom is the greatest fruit of self-sufficiency.\n\n&gt; **Fragment**\n \n\n\nEpicurus states his outlook best in his **Letter to Menoeceus**-\n\n&gt; Again, we regard independence of outward things as a great good, not so as in all cases to use little, but so as to be contented with little if we have not much, being honestly persuaded that they have the sweetest enjoyment of luxury who stand least in need of it, and that whatever is natural is easily procured and only the vain and worthless hard to win. Plain fare gives as much pleasure as a costly diet, when once the pain of want has been removed, while bread and water confer the highest possible pleasure when they are brought to hungry lips. To habituate one's self, therefore, to simple and inexpensive diet supplies all that is needful for health, and enables a man to meet the necessary requirements of life without shrinking, and it places us in a better condition when we approach at intervals a costly fare and renders us fearless of fortune.\n\nDon’t seek out and become addicted to luxury, but don’t refuse them should you stumble on them out of a bizarre sense of purity.",
