        "text": "This happened a few months ago, so the details may be slightly off. I'm sure you'll forgive me.\n\nSo, playing Edge of the Empire with a GM and three of us PCs. We are: A Force Sensitive wookie carrying some lunatic chaingun with a life debt to my character, the female Twi'lek bounty hunter who takes no guff, and lastly the Rogue Human Pilot who tends to be the one to get us into trouble more than get us out of it.\n\nQuick Background: My character was trying to collect a bounty on Teemo the Hutt, got betrayed, was forced into some rather... unsavory slavery. Broke out, saved the wookie (thus the life-debt), but sadly, my sister was also captured. My obligation (which is a great mechanic if you ask me) was to rescue my sister and complete my contract.\n\nAdventures ensue, great fun is had by all. But finally, we get the opportunity to take the fight back to Teemo who started this whole mess. I could possibly complete both my obligations at once. The original contractor turned out to be a rival Hutt, who heard we were out and wanted to sweeten the deal if we could get rid of his competitor. I jumped on the offer.\n\nWe basically went full-frontal assault on the compound. We had the help of several NPC soldiers who opened a gap for us to get through and start our search of the compound for my sister. I was determined that, if nothing else, she was going to be freed. Through some stealth, and some well placed laser blasts, and finally a liberal use of explosives, we find my sister... but she is pretty much catatonic. She has obviously been abused horribly, and it takes her a while to even recognize me. \n\nThis gets my characters blood boiling. Sexual predation is one of her triggers. My sister gets sent back to the ship with a couple of droids for protection while I decide to finish this one way or the other. Luckily, the wookie had been a slave long enough that he knew his way around. A few short minutes later.. and we bust into the throne room. Big Hutt Boss Fight!\n\nAnd we absolutely MAUL this guy. Fight in this universe generally go pretty quickly, but none of us were holding anything back, and some good rolls definitely helped. But just before the coup de grace could be performed, the ceiling explodes. A dark man floats down through the hole in the ceiling and waves his hand... all of us, Hutt included, are frozen in abject terror...\n\nWell, all of us but me. Thanks to an absolutely incredible roll, which I played IC as my complete focus on killing my target, I resisted the effects of this incredibly powerful Sith's fear suggestion. I freeze with the rest however just to keep from drawing attention to myself. The Sith turns to Teemo and begins going into a speech about how he failed the Sith, and no one is allowed to do that and live.. yadda yadda. \n\nSuddenly I realize this guy is going to kill Teemo! I tell the GM that I raise my blaster rifle (fitted with a sniper kit), as slowly and quietly as I can. He raises his eyebrows, \"This guy just froze everyone in the room on a whim, you want to take him on yourself?\"\n\nI shake my head, \"I am aiming for Teemo.\"\n\nHe laughs and lets me take my shot. I crit and Teemo's head spatters into bits of bone and blood and brain while the Sith was in the middle of a sentence. He turns back to me, eyes on fire at my insolence, \"Sorry. He was my contract.\" I say with a shrug. And just then the skies light up with blaster fire! Our NPCs have overrun the compound and are attacking the Sith from the hole in the roof!\n\nThis distracts him enough that I am able to snap the other PCs out of their stunned states and we all book it for our ship. We manage to contact the Hutt who gave me the contract and get the credits wired to us. But he also warned us that a very disturbing, dark human was asking questions and leaving bodies behind looking for a Twi'lek with a sniper rifle and a smart mouth.\n\nSo... now I have a Sith on my tail. Good times. :)",

        "text": "Before I start, please note that most of my adventures are off the cuff, and as such it might seem a little less planned.\n\nThis adventure all started while everyone was out doing some shopping.  Most of the players were just hanging out in the market, buying goods, trying to steal stuff, the usual for my group.  Our force sensitive, Melui (Human Smuggler Scoundrel) decided to grab a few drinks in the cantina and just listen in.  She heard of some kind of discovery to be made on a moon of Yavin, coincidentally IV.  Unfortunately that was all she heard as she was discovered by the group to be listening and they immediately skulked off to prevent further eavesdropping.\n\nWith this information the group decided to hit up a nearby Library to do some researching.  In the research they found that there are several missing ships primarily one that was smuggling good from Yavin IV for a Hutt lord.  This particular ship was shot down at some point and the location that it landed was never found.\n\nThe group gathers up and plots a course to Yavin IV.  Upon dropping out of hyper space, they try to do a few mass broadcasts to find a good place to land, where they immediately receive a transmission back containing only coordinates.  They opt to head towards the coordinates to find who sent them.  As they approach the area they point to, they are flanked by two A-Wings on either side.  The A-wings open a channel and inform them that they are going to take them to a docking area at a nearby rebel post and to keep all weapons, shields, and communications down until further notice so they can bring them in.\n\nThey land and disembark their ship (The Kato Kolossus - YT1300) with hands raised to see about a dozen rebel troops with weapons trained on them.  Jaseran Jinx (Human, Explorer, Thief) Looks around and happens to notice the CO at this location is a man she's worked with before on setting up an orbital bombardment on an Imperial base before.  She gets his attention and he orders the men to stand down and chats with her to catch up with her on what they are doing there.  After hearing what they are doing he offers the base to them to use as an operating location if they need it and opens its facilities to them.\n\nThey stock up and borrow a landspeeder from the rebels after checking some local maps and noticing some inconsistencies.  They head to the location of the errors and begin checking around.  Jor'Rha (Twi'Lek, Bounty Hunter, Assassin) is walking about after someone found a few pieces of scrap metal on the ground, when she falls through a hole in the hull spraining her ankle when she hits the ground.  Nobody saw where she fell so they begin looking for her as well.  Then Kotran (Zabrak, Explorer, Trader) finds the hole, but falls down as well, his leg catching on some loose wiring and hanging from the ceiling.  The rest of the group tries to find a safer way to enter into the ship now that they have found where it is mostly located as the jungle has just grown over it.  They find a door after clearing bits of brush away and attempt to open it, however it appears the bolts are locked into place and it can't be opened at this time.  Nak (Jawa, Technician, Outlaw tech) tries to use his ionization blaster to deliver enough electrical charge to disengage the locks.  Even though he missed the door itself from 2 fee away, he manages to deliver enough of a charge to the panel to jump start a backup power supply within the ship and this enables them to get the doors open with brute force.  They begin exploring the ship and enter a command room, likely where most of the crew was when the ship went down.  There is a gaping hole in the center where whatever was fired at the ship, destroyed a section of the hull, sucking most of the consoles out into space along with the crew.\n\nThey head back the opposite direction and manage to get a data chit with the cargo manifest.  Checking through the crates and the manifest they see most of the items on there, except 4 crates, of which the contents are encrypted.  They move through one of the doors in the cargo bay and find themselves in the Dining area where there are two large cooling units for food.  This seemed a bit excessive for a small ship and small crew so they began inspecting them.  They opened the cooling unit and were immediately hit by rancid food that had long since expired.  While swatting away at the smell Jaseran accidentally hit one of the shelves.  As she did this she discovered a small panel on the back wall of the unit with a button.  She pressed the button and could hear gears attempting to turn but there was too much scrap in the way as it looks like the fridge is trying to shift locations.  They begin moving the scrap away and as they do they hear blaster fire from their speeder outside.  Melui (forgot to mention she stayed to watch the speeder) radioed telling them everything is fine, just some rabbit Woolamanders, but they should probably hurry up.  They finally get the unit shifted to the side to see a small crawlspace.  Nak goes in and checks for traps.  He finds a small wire leading to a thermal detonator and disarms it.\n\nThey pull out the 4 crates they find in the hidden room and see they don't have the equipment to open them.  As they are pulling them out, they hear movement in the cargo bay.  Jor'Rha sneaks out and looks around.  She sees eyes and shadows as the red glow of the emergency lights fade in and out.  As she looks her foot gets caught in a hold in the floor.  She manages to yank it out but falls backwards and somehow causes the door to the dining area to slam shut.  All the character now take up firing position on the door and just wait.  The doors get pulled open by several creatures and they open fire.  There are approximately 8 of them but blaster fire from the rear takes out 2.  They all open fire and take down most of the creatures but not before they manage to land a few blows on the Kotran.  They dispatch the rest of them and a few that were coming through the maintenance vents above and grab the crates they can and run.  2 people per crate, except the Zabrak, he is able to carry one on his own.  They leave a 4th crate behind and as they leave the dining hall the ceiling collapses in on it leaving no way to go back.  They manage to get the crates out of the hole in the ceiling as the door they came in has shut and they don't have time to mess with it.  They get all the group and the crates on the land speeder when it gives them an overweight indicator.  They kick one of the crates off the speeder and watch it crash below as it breaks open, the contents were what appears to be Ancient Ceremonial Massassi armor, now shattered from the impact.  They zoom off in the speeder.  \n\nThey now see that the creatures are rabid woolamanders and are chasing them down, swinging through the trees and jumping down to land on the speeder.  They blast them off one by one as they drop down.  One lands on and keeps dodging the fire and ends up damaging one of the engines.  Just as he is about to strike a very large woolamander jumps on the speeder, grabs onto is, and slams his feet into the ground. He begins slowing the speeder to a crawl combined with the lack of engine power, when Melui stabs its hand with a vibroknife but ends up getting the hand stuck to the speeder. Jor'Rha takes a grenade and shoves it in the roaring woolamanders mouth and kicks him back.  Unfortunately the hand is still stuck in the speeder so he doesn't go far before detonating and destroying the rest of the engines in the back.  The Speeder slowly comes to a crawl outside the rebel outpost.  Kotran grabs a crate and runs. Jaseran and Jor'Rha grab the other and take after him, but Jor'Rha (took a stimpak earlier to help with the ankle) begins to feel her sprained ankle again and Jaseran trips.  Several of the creatures drop onto Jaseran and hold her down while Jor'Rha fires a stun blast at them to manages to hit both the creatures and Jaseran, rendering them all unconscious.  Creatures begin landing all around Jor'Rha and she defends herself while Melui tries to help take them out and calls out an SOS over the short range comlink.  Shortly after the rebel troops come out and start opening fire with heavy repeaters.  This scares most of the excess ones away but 3 still surround Jor'Rha.  She manages to take one out, while Nak runs away chugging after chugging some booze.  He then proceeds to fire a holdout blaster at the creatures from long range, hits, and just pisses it off so it chases him.  The last one is about to take a swipe at Jor'Rha when somehow the blood covered, arm and section of its body missing, giant rabit woolamander comes up and smashes it, Roaring and spewing blood all over Jor'Rha and Melui.  Jor'Rha cowers in fear for a moment, and Melui moves to attack it with her vibroknife.  She misses and it raises its hand to strike Jor'Rha when all the blood rushing away from it's arm causes it's heart to stop, and instead it collapses ontop of her.\n\nThe Rebel help to get everyone back to base and cleaned up and open one of the crates and de-encrypt the contents of all the containers.  The one left behind contained a datacron with valuable information it seems.  They pop open one of the crates and it contains numerous weapon mods.  Since the rebels saved their asses, they opted to give these supplies to them, minus one mod per person of the group.  They second crate they take away to open later (contains 100 doses of glitterstim).  They have their databanks wiped for what they encountered and the location of the base so it can't be tracked down in the future.  The group thanks the rebels and vice versa for their help and head out.\n\nThat's it for this time!  Please feel free to critique, comment, make suggestions for things I can do to improve as I am the GM and am always looking for ways to improve.\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "I will preface this by saying holy shit did the dice gods favor my runners tonight.\n\nThe group was relaxing on their back porch with some old friends waxing nostalgic and comparing recent adventures when all the commlinks went off. Literally every single commlink in the house, including the duffel bag of dummy links Breaker (the group hacker) had laying by the couch. Breaker pulled up her inbox and opened the new message marked 'urgent'.\n\nA pre-recorded message, that had quite obviously and not very skillfully been voice-altered to sound like an adult male, piped out of the speakers and everybody listened with mild bemusement. \n\n\"good evening, my name is Mr. Johnson and I have a job for you of utmost importance. I need you to extract a high-value asset from the Yamatetsu Tower in downtown Seattle. You will have the highest chance of success tonight during their release party for the new plot device. I am willing to pay a sum of Ten thousand Nuyen to each of you for the successful completion of this assignment as well as making available a five thousand nuyen slush fund to compensate the cost of any equipment lost in your attempt. The target is known by its code-name \"Queen.\" goodbye and good luck.\"\n\nQuasi (groups primary DPS street sammy adept) finished off his Mountain Soy ^(TM) and belched \"frag that, too much money with limited intel, it's a trap so Mr. J can catch him some thieves and look good for the bosses.\"\n\nBreaker shrugged, \"yeah probably, imma see if I can frag with the audio file and see what the Johnson actually sounds like, maybe we can use that to find out more, also ten grand is a lot of dosh for hookers and blow, and that black ice I want.\"\n\nEverybody shrugged and went back to talking while Breaker twitched and mumbled to herself for ten minutes before coming back to the group and smiling \"got it, though you probably won't like it Quasi.\"\n\nThis time when the audio played the voice was clearly that of a small child, maybe ten years old at most, and she sounded scared. Quasi listened to it for about three seconds, a look of pain and anger settling onto his face, before standing up and stomping into the house swearing under his breath. Less than a minute later he walked back out wearing his 'nerd pride' heavy combat armor, \"I'll be back later, hold my calls.\"\n\n(I should mention at this point that Quasi has the 'code of honor' negative quality and cannot willingly let civilians come to harm, primarily small children (because he's ex-military and saw a lot of terrible shite during the desert wars) also this was the only in-character way the group could be convinced to go on the run)\n\nSo with everybody suited up and piled into the turtle-tank (ares citymaster, don't ask) they headed out to the Yamatetsu Tower and made their plans along the way, as well as giving Quasi dreck for dragging them into it. Their plan was to have Grins (adept face) schmooze his way into the party and set up a distraction so the rest of the group could sneak in through a side door and on up to the 89th floor (where Breaker had discovered \"Queen\" the apparently powerful technomancer of \"Project Monarch\" was held due to some ridiculously good dice rolls)\n\nWith the party parked around the corner Grins jandered up to the front door and Conned his way past the doorman and up to the center stage. And then he sang a song of soul searing, mind melting, heart crushing beauty (adept power Enthralling performance, each his he gets on his singing test his audience gets as a dice pool penalty on perception. Motherfragger used edge for the rule of six and ended up with sixteen fragging hits, the largest perception someone had was twelve.) it was so beautiful even the mindless drones delivering drinks paused to listen and shed robot tears.\n\nThe team then easily snuck past the distracted guards (and pretty much unless they rolled in firing their guns into the air they wouldn't have been noticed.) and headed down the hall to the nearest elevator and Breaker plugged into it, pausing for the half second it took to slip into the system and spoof their access to the high security lab (another ridiculous success rate, thirteen of his sixteen dice were hits)\n\nafter getting up to their target floor Breaker sent Grins a message to bug out before dreck hit the fan (which he did, netting him the easiest ten K a runner ever earned) and the team swept down the hall, Max (backup tank) and Jan (dreckwrecking combat mage) taking the lead. \n\nAfter roflstomping over the rest of the security (seriously they were averaging 80% hits) they came to a gigantic steel vault door with a maglock.\n\nThey break through the door and see a nine year old blonde human girl strapped to a chair reminiscent of 'old sparky' clothed in some bulky looking bodysuit with wires poking out of it connected to several battery packs and a cruel looking chrome helmet strapped to her head.\n\n\"Hello, I'm Alice, please help me.\"\n\nQuasi jumped forward and used his combat knife to cut the straps and wires holding her down and gently removed the helmet from her head before picking her up and cradling her in one arm (3.5 meter tall troll, I wasn't gonna tell him it wouldn't work)\n\n\"Please hurry, when you cut me out it alerted security, they're on their way now. I've sent one of my friends to interfere with them but it won't slow them down much. There's a helicopter on the roof, if we hurry we can make it.\"\n\nI'll kind of gloss over the next part because at this point the characters entered beast mode, they slaughtered four HTR teams in a single combat round each and completely wrecked a custom tank-like drone I had written up (after one character using some edge and managing to get hit by two full bursts from the two full-auto assault cannons to take a whopping two boxes of damage, which is about how many you get for accidentally smacking your toe against a table) they got to the roof in about half the time I expected so the forces waiting for them there weren't nearly prepared (I was running in-game timers for how long it took them to reach the roof, I expected about three minutes (they had to go up three floors with some serious fights) and they made it in a minute thirty) and, once again drawing upon the dice magic they had completely eliminated the team of Yamatetsu Elites (re-skinned Renraku Red Samurai, the people seal team six and spetsnaz want to be when they grow up) in two initiative passes. \n\none-point-five fragging seconds\n\nthey then had enough time to warm up the Helo and dump the special forced bodies into the back of the helicopter (after running them over with the bug-zapper to prevent RFID tracking) and dipped out a full minute before the super-elite forces arrived.\n\nUpon landing (and sending the helicopter on a flight path in a straight line towards to horizon) the team had the turtle-tanks auto-pilot drive over to where they were and everybody went to safe-house one to lie low and sell off their ill-gotten gains (after taking the best stuff for themselves of course)\n\nat the end of the run they got the ten thousand from Alice, and another 67 thousand from the gear they had looted off of the bodies (that was 45% of the street value divided six ways, yeah they had some high value gear them dudes what died real good) and Quasi, rather than let Alice run off to live by herself, dumped almost the entirety of his cut of the nuyen setting up a trust fund for her and adopting her unofficially and building her a bedroom addition to their house.\n\nso that's the tale of how my runners turned a tough and deadly run into a pain-free* pile of nuyen\n\n*actually the only person on the team that didn't take any damage was Grins but the only damage they took was stun, as in non-lethal, as in they resisted the damage so hard they turned deadly bullets into bruises.",

So I had just won a battle in the arena with the paladin of the order of law by throwing up oil on him and lighting him on fire. ( that is a story for later on)\n\nSo I defeated him, and was given my reward. Ater that I ask if I can have his armor and weapon, which they gave to me seeing as I just basically threw up fire. I take it to a black smith who says I can't sell the paladin's gear, but I should return it to his order. \n\nI ponder this and ask if anyone in town has a cannon. The black Smith says he has one. I ask to borrow it and 2 powder charges as well. I forgot to mention I am in a party of 5 - a very attractive elf who I am having relations with, a small teen bard on his first adventure, a dwarf who believes he is the son of a non exsistant thunder god, a silent, extremely strong samurai, and myself.\n\nNow I get this cannon and by this time it is late in the night, with no one around. I joyously drag the cannon, the charges and the armor down the main street, while my companions alert the guard and church of this. I set up the cannon, fill it with both charges, stuff the armor into the cannon, aim it at the door of the church of Order, and as I do this the guard and the paladins surround me. I light the fuse and run. The smoke covers my escape and I run like hell, and duck into the home of a very poor family. They hide me by burying me in their dirt floor with, a flute to breath through. The guard walked in, didn't think twice about the flute since it was a poor family, and left. I was home free.\n\n\nHis name BTW is whatever he feels like - on this day it was iron tornado.\n\nEdit: Fixed grammar.",

After a week of play, we decide to start Mystcraft and are met with pretty good sucess...until...**The Third Age**.\n\nIt was late at night in The Third Age, or maybe it was an eternal night. Truthfully I couldn't tell as my power suit's night vision module had me seeing the hellish landscape ahead of me.\n\n My partner and I had arrived here maybe a few hours ago? Determined to find more of the mystical pages that could create entirely new dimensions him and I began to create these *descriptive books* rather haphazardly.\n\nThe first two we made were peaceful, ideal even. But this one, **The Third Age**, was far from peaceful. Ghasts hovered miles above us as zombie pigmen shuffled around moaning as we creeped by. Our feet dragged as we crossed the soul sand into the odd swamps and then my partner and I decided to split up.\n\nAs I said, we were here to find pages. Both us are fairly competent and in our power armor are nigh indestructible. So we decided to split up and find some of the ancient libraries which contain the before mentioned pages. I had found two such libraries, while my friend had only found one.\n\nAs I walked out of the second one, his cheerful voice turned to panic over the comms. \"*CHOPPYCHOP! SOMETHING IS INTERFERING WITH MY SUIT I C-*\" and then static. I checked the HUD map...and he wasn't there...my friend was gone.\n\n\"*Damnit*!\" I activated my sprint assist module and began trying to find my way back to the linking book we had set up, as something was clearly wrong. I arrived where I had thought the book was.\n\nI gasped in absolute confusion. The book was gone...no...it was never there at all. I had went to the wrong coordinates.\n\nI'm afraid to admit that this is when I began to panic. Tearing off my heavy power armor I grabbed at the console we had came into this world with. I began to warp in descriptive books in an attempt to find something called a *star fissure*.\n\nThese fissures are said to take you back to the true dimension, in other words...a one way ticket home.\n\nI opened each book faster than the last. I felt sick and disgusted as I teleported through demented landscapes. Eventually, I passed out only to wake up with my armor and tools gone. With but a single descriptive book left, I turned the page and felt my body ascend into the tenth age.\n\nThe sound of birds chirping. A sheep bleating. Soft Grass under my feet. And as I looked to my right, a curious hole. Approaching it, I looked deep down and saw the void.\n\nI jumped.\n\nAnd ended up where my friend and I ha-\n\n**My Friend**\n\nI pulled up my console, and warped in copies of my tools and power armor. They weren't perfect but they'd have to do for now. Teleporting to our base, I stepped into our linking room and approached the book of the Third Age.\n\n\"*I'm coming buddy, hold on*\"\n\n**TL;DR:* Got stuck in an age because I made a mistake with coordinates so I made a bunch of descriptive books in creative to find a star fissure. Died by accident so when I finally got back gave myself my armor (NEI does wonders) and tools. Warped back to Third Age to discover spawn was not at 0,0.\n",

        "text": "I've been looking for a place to tell a few of the stories I've collected during some of my campaigns, and I thought this would be a good place to do it.\n\nWe're playing Lamentations of the Flame Princess, which is based off of 1st edition D&amp;D. This was during a time where the main campaign had kind of dissolved, so the DM was just running some one-shot adventures. For this one, we were on trash island, which is, as its name suggests, a island either made entirely out of, or covered entirely in, garbage.\n\nThe first creatures we met are things I've termed opposite goblins. They're basically just goblins, except they always say the opposite of what they mean.\n\nSince we didn't really know what we were doing, we decided to ask the goblins what was on the island. They told us that there wasn't an artist colony further inland. They knew very much about them, because the artists had not fortified themselves in and were not very suspicious of strangers.\n\nWe had nothing better to do, so we decided to check it out. After a bit of walking, we find a fort made out of old cars, around where the goblins told us the artists weren't.\n\nObviously, we want to get in, because adventure. However, they're pretty well dug in, and they almost definitely outnumber us. So, we decide to try and talk our way in.\n\nFor some reason, we decide to let our cleric do the talking. The person playing our cleric is far and away the strangest person I've ever met. She always loads up her inventory with nonsensical random items, such as a ghost costume, a top hat, two cinder blocks, a trash can, dry ice, or a box of mysterious slugs (none of us know why they're mysterious, and I'm not sure she does either). She also asks everything we encounter to be her friend, and always removes the teeth of fallen enemies.\n\nSo she starts shouting up to the battlements at the guard atop the fort wall. The first thing she tries is \"Can I use your latrine?\", to which the guard replies (in a mediocre British accent) \"The whole world is a latrine!\"\n\nShe then abandons that line of questioning altogether, and uses the greatest tactic I've ever seen or heard of anyone using on a guard.\n\nShe yells to the guard \"Jim's dad has prostate cancer. You need to let us in so we can tell him.\"\n\nTurns out, there was a Jim in the fort. We did end up telling him that his dad had prostate cancer, after which he got some of his friends together and sailed off to nearby Spider Island where his dad lives.\n\nWe ended up staying the night in the fort, and then tried and failed to rob it.\n",

        "text": "In a previous session of SW:Edge of the Empire, my players did what players do and bungled up a third of my written plot in their current adventure. Ending in a settlement on a jungle planet that they had set into multiple riots and chaos, the players needed to escape *now*. The NPC helping them was a cybernetics expert, and happened to have three amphibious creatures with lizard-like heads on giraffe-like bodies. Basically three Lapras' came swimming out of the lake at the NPC's signal, saddles ready on their backs. \n\nThough this was merely a taste of what the creatures were actually for, I just sped up the story and used them as transport back to their ship, at which point I said they couldn't take them on their ship with them. And if there's one thing you learn as a GM, it's that telling a player they **can't do something** will make them move mountains to do it anyway.\n\nThe group fled to Coruscant, at which point the player in question, a droid with a cargo in his belly of 10 valuable metal ingots, went around the city streets looking for a fence to take his ingots. Sadly his Obligations were too high, meaning nobody gave him the time of day until he made himself less notorious.\n\nHe made it no secret that as soon as he found a way to sell his ingots, he was going to find somewhere to get himself one of those Lapras creatures. He asked *three times* if there was a Coruscant zoo or pet store where he could find them. Finally getting sick of his shit, I told him he runs into a contact in the streets that asks him what he's looking to trade.\n\nThe player then proceeds to tell the stranger that he has these incredibly valuable metal ingots and was looking to buy an animal with them.\n\n\"Well, what kind of animal would you be looking for?\"\n\n\"Do you have any Reevos?\"\n\n\"Reevos, you say?\"\n\n\"Yeah, like big giraffes with lizard heads that breathe underwater.\"\n\n\"Yeah, totally, I have those. How many do you want?\"\n\n*with glee in his eyes* \"Do you have *two?!*--NO, wait, **THREE?**\"\n\n\"Yeah, totally, just give me the ingots and I'll show you to them.\"\n\nThe player then gives his haul to the strange man, who then tells him to stay put as he grabs the giraffe-lizards of which he spoke.\n\nHe waited a good 3 hours out of spite even after he realized what he'd done. Then tracked the guy down, saw he had spent all of the ingots on a giant crate of Death Sticks (cigarettes), and there was nothing he could do (but he bashed the guy's head in for good measure anyway).\n\n**TL;DR:** My player was so adamant about getting an amphibious mount to ride into battle that he gave all his money to some random crackhead he found in a Coruscant alleyway.\n\n*edit: speeling*",

        "text": "I recently DM'd a game running ADnD rules with a small group of my usual 3.5 friends. The basic intent was for a campaign replicating the Tomb of Horrors difficulty but set on an Island. The players had chosen a broad spectrum of alignments and Gods, we had everything from a paladin praising St. Cuthbert to a rogue/fighter who really really liked spiders. \n\nI had already promised the players I would go out of my way to kill them and so far in the session only one player had died. It was nearing the end of the night and the players had mostly reached level 3, which means they had just started accumulating gear and more than 3 hit points, and were just starting to feel sorta invincible. They had even made friends with a cities Lord who was kind enough to give them a boat and a crew. However, the night before the group left to the boat one of them stumbled across a slightly mysterious potion. And drank it. It immediately sullied his mind and changed his alignment to Chaotic Evil and his god to Chtulhu. And because his lord and savior made him crazy he even got to use the good ole' ADnD insanity chart of fun (pg 83 of ADnD DM guide), granting him delusional insanity. The player did a wonderful job and immediately began acting as if they , a male, were a queen. The paladin and ranger in the group saw this, knew what had happened, and rather than kill him like they should have, chose instead to go along with him/her and do what she/he asked.\n\nThat's a big no no. By ignoring evil, the paladin had forsaken his promise to follow the law! And the poor old ranger couldn't very well love animals and what not by letting this monstrosity live! So the following day they were clued in to just what this kind of breech of moral code meant. They were stripped of rank, skills, gods, and level.\nNow rather than say \"fine\" and start again my players decided to enact revenge upon the one who had done this to them. And they knew just how. Using explosives, a boat, and some very unknowing crew they rigged the freshly borrowed boat with explosives, ordered the crew to sail 30 miles away from the island... and blew up the boat with everyone on board. \n\nIn the end only I got what I wanted. All my players had died at least once, and evil had triumphed once more. The players now understand that choosing alignment isn't just what you spend 2 seconds doing during character gen, but rather what you operate on. And because of the hilarious method they used to get revenge, I've been lenient and allowed them to come back next week with some fresh level 3 characters. But while they may think they are out of the woods, the truth is far worse, every action has a reaction, and they will soon discover just what evil they had let win.",

        "text": "So I was running a game of Heroes Against Darkness (a free D&amp;D-like) recently. I'm GMing for a large group right now, at least when everyone's paying attention (I could stand to be more assertive), so I won't list all of the player characters. The one that was at the center of this anecdote is the party's half-elven healer, Elthale.\n\nAnyway, the party was by a lake in the dwarven lands, and they saw burnt patches of ground all around. The apparent cause of this was the fireballs that were randomly flying, sprinkler-like, from the top of the \"clockwork tower\" on the far end of the lake.\n\nAnyway, as they take a boat to the tower, one of the fireballs fell toward them. Elthale creatively used a haste-style spell to give the rowers more actions, allowing them to move the boat faster and successfully avoid the fire. They safely reached the tower's docking bay. It was dark at first, but they used spells and items to illuminate the area, which turned out to be guarded by a group of Drow. A battle ensues.\n\nHere's the layout. The room was basically shaped like a big, blocky letter C. The entrance was the open part of the C. The boat, still going at a good clip due to the accelerated rowing, started there and coasted forward forward 5' (1 square) per round. At the far end was a big dock in front of the stairs to the higher levels of the tower, guarded by a greatsword-toting Drow \"Battlemaster\" (using the Human Battlemaster stats). Smaller docks led to pathways on both sides. Bow and crossbow-wielding Drow flanked the boat from those pathways.\n\nAnyway, battle happened. Our party's eccentric frost-lizardman (cold-dwelling lizardman from the region of Polt) \"Frostlord\" (basically a cryomancer warlock with a touch of Berserker) got creative with some ice pillars, making a neat bridge to some of the smaller docks and allowing some melee without any tests of athletics needed. Wilhelm screams were uttered as Drow flew over the railing and into the water, creative tactics were used, and the bowmen were taken care of.\n\nSoon, only the Battlemaster remained at the far end. He had been spinning his sword for a few rounds, and he proceeded to jump into the air and throw it at the party members on the boat (indeed, I'm a JRPG fan! How could you tell?). Some damage was taken, but the worst seemed yet to come: his jump continued in the direction of the boat. Presumably, he would have landed and reclaimed his sword on his next turn (which had embedded itself in the deck of the boat) and started wreaking havoc in melee against the ranged and magicky types unless something was done about it.\n\nLet me explain something before continuing. Elthale's player is consistently involved in the roleplaying aspect of the game, which is good. However, he tends to do a lot of planning. He's no munchkin, but he works out a lot of strategies and ability combinations that confuse me at times. When his plans don't work out, he sometimes get a bit upset. Not really angry, but he will not hesitate to argue his point.\n\nAnyway, Elthale cast a spell that immobilized the Drow (with bits of paper in this case; Elthale uses art to cast spells), halting its jump. I ruled that the Drow was restrained in midair, its forward and vertical momentum immediately halted. I even tossed in a bit of whiplash damage. Anyway, when the Battlemaster's turn came around, it used its \"Shake It Off\" ability to break free of the effect. Therein lies the issue.\n\nJust to be clear, the monster version of \"Shake If Off\" is different than the player version. The text says that it just gets to break free of one condition at the end of its turn. No check or action is needed. Now, since it was restrained, I didn't concern myself with the action, but I thought that it would be fair to make it roll anyway. It succeeded with a Strength roll to cut its way out of the paper with a dagger and break free, which I thought would be appropriate. However, Elthale's player took issue with this, even after I explained the monster version of Shake It Off (I did fumble around a bit at first, though, as I hadn't concerned myself with whether or not it was prohibited from using it because of the restraint- all it could really do was fall for actions, and no action was needed to use this). After explaining the difference and how it worked (and that I had added in a roll to be fair), he still thought that it was kind of unfair, and that all of his non-healing spells were now rendered useless. Unable to convince him otherwise (despite mentioning that only a few, tough monsters have Shake It Off anyway), I apologized and continued the game. It wasn't graceful, and I sort of mangled the explanation, but I tried. This is not to say that I am a paragon of awesomeness and that he was in the wrong. His concern is understandable, and I would share some of his sentiments in that position. I just tried and failed to satisfy him with my explanation.\n\nAnyway, when its next turn came around, the Drow fell straight down into the water (remember, the jump's momentum was lost). Anyway, once in the water, it tried to climb the front of the boat and get to its sword on the deck. The party members on the boat kept it down, however.\n\nAnyway, here's the reason for my posting this story. Soon after Elthale's player's complaint, the boat kept on moving forward and, running into the big dock that the Battlemaster had started at, rammed said drow against the dock. I didn't even fudge that for the player's benefit or anything (though that might have been a good idea anyway). The boat's speed happened to lead it to the end when the Drow was in the water, which it only was because it had escaped from the restraint spell.\n\n***In short, the \"useless\" status spell actually led the party to victory.*** I was just amused by that, and I hope that I'll soon be able to laugh with the player about this. Anyway, thank you for bearing with my wall of text. I just wanted to share that.",

        "text": "(So this is another story from earlier in that campaign. I'll post the character's again. There was I, Kabuto the Halfling psychic, Lendar the Elf thief. Theor the Dwarf Ranger and Esriep the Human Sorcerer while using the vampire template.)\n\nWe had just escaped an attack on a village where the party had met. So the characters were all adjusting to each other and getting to know each other. We also had an NPC with us, a giant bear. That's right, a giant bear in huge armour, it was the DM's character before we decided for him to be DM. So, we're in this cave and we decided to go to sleep, except from Esriep of course.\n\nWhen we awoke, we did what we normally would do in a new area, that being spot checks. Lendar went first and spotted a rabbit. Then it was Kabuto's turn. He walked out and found a small bit of water, but when going towards it, the DM decided to throw in a quick dex check. Rolling a critical fail, Kabuto tripped over a rock and fell on his face. To the DM's description, he slid a few feet on his face before his own feet touched down. Giving the rest of the party a fine laugh. But after recovering from that we walked deeper in to the cave, when someone (can't remember who, memory's a bit fuzzy.) found a small hole in the wall, indicating a tunnel. Our Dwarf who had managed to roll an incredibly high starting strength, swung his hammer down and brought down the wall in one swing. \n\nWe entered with haste. (I should mention at this point that Esriep was awake with us considering the darkness of the cave.) We stepped in to the tunnel and walked for a small length before encountering our first real foe. A skeleton. Lendar attacked first, shooting at it with his bow and watching as an arrow slid through the skeleton's ribs and went flying down the tunnel. Then, it was time for Kabuto. Who while wielding his walking stick (He was a travelling halfling) Went to swing it. But, seeing as it was dark, I received a negative to my dex seeing as I didn't have dark vision. I rolled a critical fail once again. This was hilarious to the group considering it was my first session ever and I had already rolled 2 critical failures. Well, it was funny to all but one seeing as Kabuto's stick swung round and broke Esrieps nose, dealing a good 6 points of damage immediately. \n\n(But yes, these both happened within about 20 minutes of each other. I have a few more stories but that will be it until we have another session. They always include hilarity.) \n\n",

        "text": "Hoohooo, boy! Children, are you gonna **love** this. Y'remember the how I was tellin' yah about Three Dog, that monster summon? Well, it turns out he's been up to a lot more than pushin' mooks overboard or beatin' bosses before the ragtag heroes can get their initiative scores in order and, oh *man*, it gets better.\n\nNow y'know me, children, I'm not one to ramble, but I've gotta give you a background check on Tyribas' latest band of adventurers. Six in total: a magus, a 'slinger, a dorf barbarian on a diplomatic mission, a sorcerer on the hunt for bounties, a kobold with raptor friends, and a half-drow with more felonies to his name than the rest of the party combined (well, he *would* if he'd been caught doin'em). An odd bunch, they met like most adventurers do - in the middle of combat against some random grunts that appeared out of nowhere.\n\nBut these guys, these six random guys, they make an impression on the king. Remember how the whole raid was based around the crown Prince being on board the airship? Well, right after Three Dog did his thing, who else should show up but the King himself, full regalia and royal airship in tow? \n\nAs it turns out, the prince wasn't the only target for kidnapping, and his sister hadn't been so lucky as to have a band of plucky heroes nearby. So the king tasked the party - less with convincing words and more with bags of gold bigger than your head - to sneak into a rebel stronghold on a rescue mission, with a hit order on the rebel leader to boot.\n\nEverything goes off well, at first. The party does their things, gets in good graces, scouts the location... and then that dealer, a rogue, managed to get himself caught trying to messily murder the guard outside of the head honcho's room. Now, this turns out to be a good thing for their mission, since the jail he gets thrown into after getting beaten to an unconscious pulp is just down the hall from the princess' cell. The magus, making liberal use of his invisibility spells and spell recall, snuck in, got the doors open, and got the rogue and princess on their feet.\n\nHere's the good part, children. While the rest of the rebels were occupied in a debriefing regarding the latest assassination attempt on Comrade Leader, our party was busy orchestratin' *another* hit attempt. They fought their way past the guards and locked a vault door behind 'em to keep the mob of rebel scum from swarmin'. They're facing down the leader - and, I kid you not, he's one of those psion freaks. He does a number on our heroes; tradin' blows with the magus, knockin' the dorf on the skull, and generally handing them their asses. Again. But then, the magus burns everything he's got to deliver one helluva spellstrike, and the rogue manages to get his daggers into the guy's ribcage a few times, so the bugger starts running.\n\nNow, Three Dog's been hanging back, since this is *definitely* not his fight, especially after getting reduced to 1HP by a guard with a sharp boot outside. But as Dear Comrade runs by, Three Dog does his thing and makes an attack - and *massacres* this guy.\n\nY'know the fountain in the middle of capital square? Of course you do. Well, the plume of blood that shot out of this guy's jugular after Three Dog ripped it out was about as high as the water spout in the fountain, if that paints a grisly enough picture for ya'll. And that's the fight - done, over with, Three Dog takes the kill *again.*\n\nAnd it's at this moment that a divine light shone down from above, my children. And the LORD did say, \"Holy **SHIT!**\" and there was much rejoicing among the adventurers as our boy Three Dog started glowin' like the tip o' Gandalf's staff. A lot of things happened right then - first off, Three Dog got a look in his eye like he finally \"got\" something; kinda like the look a toddler gets when he first figures out that the fleshy things attached to him are bits o' him. Second, he started morphin' around, and by the time the glow wore off he was a full-fledged Dire Wolf. Once that was over with, he started howlin' - and, I tell you, there ain't *nothin'* like Three Dog's howl.\n\nSo if you've got a monster summon and want to take a lesson from Three Dog, just remember - you, too, can get PC levels, if only you're badass enough to claim 'em.\n\n---\n\n**OOC** Three Dog the monster summon who was too awesome to banish stuck around with the party and survived the initial fights in the hideout raid. During the fight with the rebel leader, he lands a *triple-crit* attack of opportunity and drops the guy, effectively derailing a lengthy chase scene the DM had had planned in a single dice roll.\n\nThis *monster summon II* had killed *every boss* the party had fought in the campaign so far, and *always* in an epic manner. He pushed one guy off the side of an airship and ripped the throat of a psion out with an AoO triple crit - he was the party goddamn mascot, and we'd be **damned** at that point if he wasn't given some serious levels to match his level of badassery. The DM conceded; he upgraded the wolf to a Dire Wolf and said he'd get PC levels... and there was much rejoicing.\n\nNow, earlier in the evening, we'd been discussing bards, and the idea of Three Dog being a Pathfinder bard came up. So, of course, we imagined our then-wolf as a bard named Three Dog, and the name stuck. So now when he's *actually* getting character levels, he *had* to be a bard - but the DM insisted on holding at least some form of order and rolled a random selection. He rolled on a table... and sat in stunned silence for 30 seconds. \"What did you roll?\" Silence. \"What, is he a friggin' paladin?\" Silence. \"Oh god. He's a fucking bard.\" Silence. \"*Holy shit he's a bard.*\" The DM walks over to the whiteboard, writes \"I rolled a 2. Bard was the 2nd class on the table,\" and then he collapses into an unholy combination of sobs and maniacal laughter.  \n\n[This was the room's response. Madness. Unadulterated madness.](http://youtu.be/xSGW7CwD5GM?t=28s)\n\nAnd that's how we got a Dire Wolf Bard.\n",

Hell if I know, but I'm gonna *keep writing anyway.* Now listen up children, it's time for the story of Three-Dog. For those of you who've heard about Tyribas, it's a homey little kingdom that's not too bad a place to set up shop and put down roots... well, if not for the roaming dinosaurs, the undead dwarf army in the mountains, or the elves invading from the south. \n\nNow, just a few weeks ago a band of cats coming from the coast on the airship Enterprise ran into some trouble with Shadow Hand rebels. Turns out, the crown prince was travellin' incognito-like, but *somebody* was a little loose-lipped at the tavern and some rebel punks tried to kidnap him. Here's where our heroes come in, children - I guess the big man upstairs found it fit to put the right people in the wrong place, and a bunch of adventurers happened to be on board to kick those bandits' asses back to the First Age.\n\nNow, these guys come from every background you can imagine. One's a guard in his majesty's not-so-secret service, another's an airship first mate with a penchant for gunpowder and a flair for the dramatic, a third's a drug dealer half-drow who, to be honest, scares the life outta me, kiddies. Hell, one of them - and no, I'm not making this up - is a kobold druid. With raptors. *Raptors, children.* \n\nNow, they have a sorcerer with 'em, and while they're fighting against the Shadow Hands' little minions he casts that wonderfully useful spell Summon Monster II, and out pops a wolf. They wipe the deck of the raiders, and run up to the bridge to deal with the man with the plan; a sergeant of the rebellion.\n\nWhile the mooks they've been fighting so far have been short work, this guy's a walking tank. More metal than man, he's decked out in some pretty badass armor and wielding a scary-lookin' hammer like he's some sorta doped up hill giant poser. Long story short, he's handin' our heroes a helluva fight and doesn't look like he's gonna go down easy... but then, Three Dog joins the fight.\n\nHe jumps, he jukes, he jives like one foxy dog, nippin' at Bossman's heels, buyin' time for the heroes to do their thing. But then, the unimaginable happens - the beginnings of a legend, children. The Legend of Three Dog, boss-killing badass summon. He bull rushes, he hits, and he pushes ol' Bossman over the edge of the airship with a one-way-ticket earthbound. \n\nNow, as you know, wizards and witches, Summon Monster II only lasts about a minute. In Three Dogs' case, his time on this twisted earth should've only been about thirty seconds; in those thirty seconds, he killed more men than our heroes combined, including an officer of the kingdom's rebellion. Thirty seconds came, thirty seconds went, and Three Dog was still standin' tall. In spite of the odds, in spite of the laws of magic sayin' otherwise, Three Dog didn't feel like dispelling so soon. He'd be stickin' with our heroes for a while longer, come hell or high water, because by Pelor he still had jugulars to rip out and hitching posts to claim as his territory.\n\nAnd that, my children, was just the beginnin'. That's it for today, kiddies. Keep your swords sharp, your spellbooks open, and your trap-magnet at the front of the party, and I'll see ya soon. This is Thorgold, signin' off.\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr** Sorcerer summons a Wolf. Wolf proceeds to wreck face and gets more kills than the rest of the party combined by maneuvering enemies over the edge of an airship. Rules-wise, he earned enough XP to level up from the encounter. The party went nuts, and even the DM overlooked the spell rules to let \"The Wolf\" stick around, with an upgrade to pseudo-familiar.\n\nWhy's he called Three Dog? Find out, *next time*, on the Legend of Three Dog; Ascension!\n\n---\n\nBonus: Random off-topic during the session prompted the creation of \"The DM's Prayer:\n\n&gt;Our DM, who art in Fairchild*, hallowed by thy dice. Thy campaign come, thy plot be done, on the board as it is in your notebook. Give us this day our prepared spells, and forgive us our meta, just as we forgive your fiat against us. Lead us not into TPK, but deliver us from railroading. Praise Helix.\n\n*Fairchild is the name of the building we hold our games in. Substitute an appropriate location or, for a generic prayer, \"Who art in character,\"",

        "text": "(Ok, so this was a session that took place a few months ago. I'm not entirely sure. It was my first or second time ever playing a table-top RPG, so please keep that in mind.) \n\nAnyway, there were four of us. There was I, Kabuto the Halfling psychic, Lendar the Elf thief (original, right?). Theor the Dwarf Ranger and Esriep the Human Sorcerer (while using the vampire template.)\n\nWe were in a fort, which we found out somewhat too late, was occupied by enemy forces. We didn't know this at the time and entered, them obviously letting us in. We held up and the vampire rested during the day. Kabuto was a character troubled by his past, so he took to wandering in his spare time. Theor was our diplomat, so he was in the main hall talking to the leader of the fort to have supplies and messengers sent out to alert our allies of our intentions to head north. (Side not here before I tell you what Lendar was doing, the player, and the character are our, how would you say, dozy, delirious target for all abuse. Though in good spirit, of course.)\n\nLendar was out in the courtyard, making friends. (So, seeing as we were all a bit new to this, we rarely took checks in social situations, only in diplomatic.) Lendar was in a situation where he, for some unexplainable reason, was surrounded by guards on the ground.. With a dog pissing on him. I kid you not. The best part being that his character was so happy go lucky, he accepted this. Anyway, while Kabuto was on his walk, he took a stroll up to an alcove above the room that Theor was in. Theor, overhearing some talk of the enemy, asked the wrong question, that being something a long the lines, \"What do you mean this station is under the control of...?\" This, ended with him being trapped between multiple spear wielding guards. Kabuto ran back to Esriep's room, waking him up. Esriep alerts his ghouls to the situation, falling back asleep as the ghouls and I haul ass to where Theor is.\n\nThe two ghouls jump from the alcove, after a roll of fifteen, not taking any damage and swing in to combat. Theor takes his chance, on a dex check, he leaps over the table and rolls to hit. Landing a critical, he takes off the general's head and sends it whirling through the air. At that moment, the door blasts open and a large group of guards can be seen outside. Kabuto in his alcove takes action. taking an int check for psychic enervation, rolling a 17, succeeding. He then casts psychic missile, rolling a natural 20, he aims at the wall. It connects sending it crumbling over the masses of guards and killing every one of them.\n\n\n(I'll be posting more of these, more hilarious by default. I've just been wanting to tell this one for a while.) \n",

        "text": "I'm getting fed up with the Pathfinder group I'm in. Some of the players in the group seem to have more fun arguing than actually playing. I'm the \"noob\" of the group, though, so I would feel really awkward talking to the DM about it, since it's his group of friends anyway.\n\nThe session we had last night was terrible. It's been a month and a half since our group has gotten together to play. I would have hoped everyone would be excited enough to not bicker about everything. Instead, there was more arguing and pointless bullshit than ever before.\n\nIt all started when we were having some downtime at the beginning of the session. The player of the ninja wanted to find a weapon that counted as an \"unarmed\" weapon, that he could use cold iron and silver plating on. We were in a dwarven mountain city, and due to the raging storm outside, the doors to the outside were permanently closed. The city did not have anything like that inside, and the craftsmen, being used to making axes, swords, and other standard weapons, weren't able to craft anything for him. He got upset, but we moved on.\n\nWe were trying to track the creatures who have been murdering the council members in the city. These monsters couldn't be tracked (they excel at jumping, and were covering their tracks and leaving false trails), but we didn't know that yet. We tried to track it, but our rolls didn't turn up squat (we didn't roll spectacularly either). This same player wanted to do repeated perception checks in all directions to see which way the monsters went. Now, there's a skill specifically for tracking (survival), and in the PRD for the skill, it specifically says you can't track unless you use Survival.\n\n&gt; Alternatively, you can use the Perception skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature's passage using the same DCs, but you can't use Perception to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.\n\nHe fought the DM on this until some of us were getting frustrated.\n\nEventually he dropped it and we were talking about setting up an ambush for the monsters, using the remaining council members as bait. He started fighting this too, saying it was a bad plan. I honestly wasn't sure what he was getting at, something like \"It would be too suspicious to use all the council members as part of the same trap, people who are paranoid about getting killed would be more likely to separate.\"\n\nNot only was he using weird logic (look at horror movies. people don't split up when they're locked in a city and something is trying to kill them. the ones who go by themselves die), he had no alternative plans. He didn't have anything to suggest, and he was trying to defeat the only thing we could think of to do.\n\nWe moved on, deciding to use only one council member as bait, hiding the other members in a fairly secure room in the same building. When we were preparing ourselves for the ambush, this player wanted to go talk to the drow emissaries and buy spider silk, using it to somehow make a silent alarm with trip wires connected to each his fingers, so we could have security on the 6 windows.\n\nThe drow didn't have any for him, which upset him. He tried his underworld contacts, who also couldn't help him. He then wanted to get the next thinnest thing, and see if it would work. Obviously, twine is visible, even in the darkness to creatures with darkvision. He fought the DM on that too, for a long bit of time, before giving up on that idea.\n\nWe were playing for at least 5 hours, probably more, and managed to barely squeeze in one fight, when the creatures fell for the bait. It was rather uneventful, other than the first hit of the battle being a critical hit on a flurry of blows that also did damage to another character's armor. The player of this character (my girlfriend) got super pissed and didn't even care about the game any more at that point. In her eyes, we had done pretty much nothing but argue the whole time, and as soon as she was able to do something fun, she almost got one-hit-killed and had to run away.\n\nI don't know. It sucks to have your ideas shot down by the DM every time you try to do something. But everything he tried to do couldn't be done with the resources we had available. This player even got talked to privately, twice by the DM, in response to two of the things I mentioned in this post (I forget which ones). He dragged out every argument, took up a lot of time getting nothing done, and ended up making hardly anything happen in last night's session.",

        "text": "As with most tales, a short introduction of the members involved is needed, as well as a short background of the setting that these heroes(?) find themselves in.\n\nThe world trends more towards a \"standard\" fantasy setting, with the stereotypical dwarves, elves, and gnomes. The magic in this world is slightly more subdued than the fireball throwing, lightning-sparking displays normally thought of by most. The magic is more of the manipulative kind, with slight tricks of mind influence and bending trees or breaking rocks(this is key later on).\n\nBut enough of the world. Let us meet our heroes of this adventure. First and foremost of our group is me, a pleasantly laidback warrior with a fondness for spears, huge armor, and massive towershields named Scafwolf(SW). I made him with an overpowering fear/hatred for bunnies. Just an amusing quirk that has gotten us into trouble a lot of times. Our ranger and all-round good guy is Maeg(M), who is inclined to carry an obscene amount of knives secreted around his person and enjoys smoking a pipe, despite spending an inordinate amount of time up in trees and in a forest. The wizard is rather forgettable except for his penchant for painting. His name is Trivius(T). The gnome of our party is an alchemist who creates various potions and sells explosive ones exclusively to T, on commission. His name is Finius Fisituy Fogreddle(FFF)\n\nSo our intrepid band of adventurers has been hired to secure the lands surrounding a fair-sized village leading up to a grand festival that they are holding to celebrate the passing of a plague, that was rather cleverly solved with the assistance of our alchemist, and my hatred of bunnies(who were carriers for the plague. Dang rabbits.)\n\nThe party finds a perfectly round boulder that is quite sizable. Since it is such a recognizable landmark, we all agree to use this as our base camp while we search this area(it was a mountainous region to the west of town. Sea was to the east). Our Ranger ventures off and we settle down. T turns to the DM.\n          *T: I paint the rock.*\n          *DM: You what?*\n          *T: I paint the rock like a globe while we wait for the ranger.*\n\nThe DM agrees to allow this. He then turns to me and tells me to roll for listening. Uh oh. I roll a 14, and he tells me that I hear...nothing. No birds, no nothing. T has finished his masterpiece and we head off together, leaving FFF behind to guard the camp and protect our rock.\n\nM finds us wandering around the woods a little bit later and informs us that he has found a cave system that looks to be inhabited by a troll and possibly some minions. We head back to camp to hash out a plan.\n\nUpon our return, the first thing that we notice is that the giant boulder that T had spent half his painting supplies on was gone. Quite curious considering the large size and the fact that it was on rather flat ground.\n\nFFF emerged from hiding in a bush.\n           *FFF: A troll ate your world, T.*\n           *T: I beg your pardon?*\n           *FFF: this giant troll came along and saw the boulder, and I                  guess he thought that it was edible.*\n\nIn terms of character motivation, T was pretty upset that he lost his world, and the DM was looking a little too smug about the whole situation. We'll show *him* in part two when we meet again this weekend.\n",

        "text": "**Disclaimer:** I belong to a gaming club at my university and every week I play in a one shot there, some of these stories are old and my memory is shoddy so I may not remember certain things. All stories use the Savage Worlds rule system. I will use terms and reference things without explaining them much just ask if you wish to know what I am talking about.\n\nA Lot of Luck and Fire\nSetting: Deadlands :Hell on Earth\nCharacters: Rusty the Junker (Me), The Templar, The Toxic Potato Shaman (and his potato golems), The Crazy Lady\n\nThis was my first foray into the system so I took the premade character offered me because he had a flamethrower and fire is fun. I soon came to the realization that this was my primary weapon and my teammates were all melee characters.\n\nThe game began with us pulling up outside of a doctor’s office in Junktown, it was basically a shack, to get information on the job he had contacted us about. We entered the office to find the doctor being threatened by a group of thugs who we quickly take care of. So with a few crispy bodies in the front waiting area and a thug digesting in the stomach of one of the potato golems he tells us that the citizens of a nearby town found some kind of vault. \n\nSo after a stop off at the town where the children of the townsfolk told us where the vault was we were on our way to a mysterious vault fully knowing that enemies had set up shop there. Sure enough when we got there we got caught up in a shootout and an unfortunate group of enemies learned that I was really good at rolling to light things on fire. The rest were quickly mopped up by my companions and the adults from the village who were nearby and came to give us a hand. Then I learned why the other players didn’t like these enemies as a lucky shot got one of them in the head destroying the chip that was planted there and caused all of their equipment to explode including the grenade on their belt. But still, no casualties on our side so we were feeling rather confident as we strode into the vault.\n\nWe snuck passed the zombies inside until we found what was so valuable in this vault. There before us sat a Ghost Rock bomb, the things that had ushered forth the apocalypse, and truck we could carry it on. So we loaded it on the truck and put the truck on the freight elevator that was in the room with just enough time to bar the door against the 30 odd enemies that had just arrived to kill us. The door bought us a few rounds of combat for the elevator to start ascending so we had an elevated position when the guards came pouring in. From our elevated spot we opened up with every weapon we regardless of ability to use said weapons in the hope that we would be able to hold them back, the flamethrower was working wonders on this front, and then it happened. A bullet found its way into a soldiers chip, two players spent their last bennies to cause this, and his grenade exploded which caused a chain reaction which blew us back and all of them to pieces.\n\nWhen the elevator arrived at the top we found out what an earlier adventure card had affected. Instead of finding a bunch of troops at the ready and two horrible warmech things we found a bunch of dead people being eaten by rats and two horrible warmech things. I managed to get us out without dying by cobbling together a temporary cloaking device with spare parts and junker magic. Just when we think we are in the clear we see a V-tol patrolling nearby and we know we won’t be able to avoid this fight. There is one small problem however we don’t have a way of hurting it. The only weapons we have that could cause it damage are my flamethrower, some grenades we found, and the bomb which we aren’t keen on using. So after some discussion we decide on our plan of action. I use my last power points to cobble together a crude rocket and launcher into which we stuff the grenades and the remains of one the potato golems into the launcher and send it all flying at the V-tol and we just barely managed to hit it causing it to crash. After it crashed we took off for Junktown at full speed. On the way we drop kicked the Crazy Lady off the back of the truck. She was creeping us out.\n \n**End Notes:** That came out a lot longer than I had originally intended I will try to keep the other stories shorter.\n",

This silliness is reserved for those times when we're in a dungeon crawl as we were two weeks ago, sneaking through the Underdark while most of the drow were busy with their invasion topside.  \n\nThe drow had recently been taking Topsiders down below to either murder or enslave them and we went down to rescue who we could, kill as many as we saw and capture a leader.  Eventually we get to a drow noble's throne room but as we're opening the door, a side conversation is going on where two of the players are joking around to a YouTube video of [Hanna Barbera sound effects](http://youtube.com/watch?v=g5LuFBxL41Y).\n\nSuddenly we see what's inside is essentially a rape room with a throne in a raised platform so the noble can watch her people defile the humans they've captured.

        "text": "I was running an Easter themed Delta Green one-shot that took place in the fictional town of Whitechapel, Missouri. The party were Delta Green agents from B-Cell and included an ex-Marine turned IRS agent, a gun instructor from Westpoint, a diplomat/gun merchant from France and a German immigrant who works at the National Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC. \n\nTheir mission was to investigate a jewelry theft in Whitechapel that was thought by their handler to have occult influences. The big reveal at the end was supposed to be that in the center of Whitechapel on Calvary Hill was the mythical Garden of Eden, and Pastor Lucas, the youth pastor of the Damascus Church in town was using stolen gold, frankincense and myrrh with the apples from the tree of good and evil to make a wine that turned people into Jesus. He was doing this to homeless on the street, slaughtering the jesus clones and harvesting them for steaks that he was using for communion, trying to be closer to God by eating him. Crazy creepy stuff.\n\nThe investigation went pretty well, they were getting creeped out by all the religious references, (Their room was #666, they kept getting woken up at 3:16am, Bible passages kept appearing everywhere, etc) but at the end things went a little crazy. The police finally figured out they weren't the FBI agents they claimed to be and were chasing them as they went up to Calvary Hill to finally confront Father Lucas before the Easter service the next morning where he was going to try and summon Jesus from heaven by slaughtering 12 Jesus Clones. They make it up the hill and find an old church building with a crab apple tree in front. One person bites an apple and recognizes the smell from the wine they had found early, and decides the tree has to be chopped down. \n\nI had no idea what to do, obviously chopping down the tree would have to have some impact on the world, it's the Tree of Knowledge for goodness sake! So on the fly I had the Earth start to rumble, the tree start to leak a sick green vile liquid and when she finally cut the tree down out of it's stump slithered a large winged serpent.\n\nSo, not only do they have Father Lucas and the Jesus Clones to contend with, they have Beelzebub loose from his prison and he's kinda pissed. Lucas goes down with one gunshot since he's just human. Jesus clones scatter into the wild but Beezlebub is a tougher nut to crack. The German tries to grapple with him and gets up on his back while the Diplomat takes a magical spear they found in their Green Box and stabs the serpent in the chest where it was promptly stuck. The serpent roared in pain and took off with the German on his back and the Diplomat clinging for dear life onto her spear. \n\nOn the ground, IRS agent and Westpoint Instructor have to deal with the Police about to stumble across the scene, they have no clue how to get rid of the rest of the tainted wine, the church, the massacred Jesus corpses and the Tree of Knowledge, so up in flames it goes with a few hastily made malatovs. Up in the air, the German and the Diplomat realize it's a lost cause and they manage to land with only a few broken bones and half their hit points left. Reunited the four of them make their escape, their mission technically a success despite the demon they let loose on the world and the destruction of one of the oldest places on Earth.\n\nAll in all, it was six hours of the best one shot I've ever had the pleasure of DMing, and they all want to come back and do another session for the next holiday. Arbor day is next week, hopefully I can think up something by then. :)",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/23jegd/kerberos_club_fatelord_byrons_notes_part_1/",
        "text": "I am also the GM of a [Shadowrun game](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1n07u7/shadowrun_the_first_run/) and a [Fate Accelerated one shot campaign](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1scr5r/fae_social_combat_mongol_style/), and I have unrecounted material for both, which I am certain to get back to in the future. Most certainly. But for now I am here because of my third campaign: a tale of adventures in a world of steam, magic, and ~~rampant~~ rousing nationalism.\n\nKerberos Club is a game for Wild Talents or FATE, set in a 19th century London where every pulp fiction dream is real. It's a world where men are truly men, unless they're fairies, aliens, godlings, demons, automechanical creations, shape shifters, or irish, in which case things become a little less well defined. It's a world where Queen Victoria takes the throne and becomes God, where an indelicate dalliance may grant Syphilitic Vampirism, and where the War Pyramids of Atlantis blitz London. In this world, the gentlement, gentlewomen, and *others*, of the Kerberos Club are Britain's first and last line of defense against the Strange that so permeates the world. Russia's attempts to seize the Orient by magical means, the cataclysmic results of certain languages translatable with the Rosetta Stone, the unbearable stench of London summers; they're all the purview of the Club.\n\nIn particular, we will follow some members of the Club:\n\n* **Lord Andrew Sterling** - The younger brother of Earl Sterling, and perhaps the finest master of Bartitsu, he is a notable member of the British Geographical Society and a well traveled gentleman. He has seen the most remarkable parts of Africa, Arabia and the Orient. He has documented ancient sites of cultural heritage, and rescued its treasures for proper appreciation by the more civilized minds of the British upper class. While in India, he came to be accompanied by Dipak Nagarkar, a scholar and mystic with a hankering to see the world.\n\n* **Trentor Regis Cromwell** - A state sponsored boffin, and perhaps the most brilliant mind in Europe. His scientific genius is centuries ahead of his time, allowing him to construct mechanical marvels with little more than gum and some brass paperclips. Foremost among his creations is his constant companion Mr. Reynolds, a steam-powered mechanical golem.\n\n* **Earl James McBorough of Edinburgh** - The destitute Earl, who lost both family and fortune in a terrible fire which he could have prevented. His Strange eye allows him to see both past and future, and he has the ability to stop time for brief periods of time, but is practically helpless without his grandfather's watch. He has dedicated his life to preventing the terrible tragedies that occur all around - from train accidents to spilled tea - but has turned rather eccentric in the process.\n\n* **Lady Emilia Brentwood** - The youngest child and only daughter of the terribly doting Earl Essex, she has inherited two gifts from her parents (apart from a first rate education, a great deal of wealth, and social influence). From her mother's side she carries the blood of the Siren, that grants her voice a particular persuasiveness - and on occasion a considerable force of destruction. From her father's side, she has gained the protection of a secret order of knights, represented by the young Elizabeth Gray, who poses quite competently as her lady's maid.\n\nBut when we begin, our heroes are not yet members of the Club; indeed, it is some years even before Victoria takes the throne. It is Thursday April 9th, 1835, the day after Robert Peel resigned as Prime Minister (which is not relevant to this story).\n\nThe four characters are not aware that they are about to be tested for potential membership in the Club and put to the Challenge by their respective sponsors. The scenario aspect is *This is too easy…*\n\n----\n\nMr Cromwell is enjoying his morning tea in the break room adjoining his laboratory slash workshop, when his friend and mentor, Sir Aubrey, Chair of the Royal Academy of Science, storms in. Tossing his coat to Mr. Reynolds, currently on coat hanger duty, Sir Aubrey sits while pouring himself a cup and nicking one of Trentor's scones.\n\n\"Trentor, my good man, I have a favour to ask. How much do you know of Lord Byron? Rhetorical question. See, the British Museum has a new exhibition about him. Opens tomorrow. They have his last notebook; in from Venice. I strongly suspect there's something Strange about it, and I'd appreciate it very much if you could get a hold of it before someone else goes about reading it. Never know what might happen. Go ahead and bring it to me tonight - I'll be at my Club, you know the place. But whatever you do, make sure nobody else gets it, and nobody reads the blasted thing. Cheerio!\"\n\nWith a wave of his hand, a brushing of crumbs, retrieving of his coat, Sir Aubry removes himself from the premises, handing his empty cup to a lab assistant on the way.\n\nTrentor slowly sips his tea to ease his frayed nerves before rising from his chair. \"Mr. Reynolds, fetch me my coat. I shall be at the museum.\"\n\n----\n\nLord Andrew, in the breakfast room of the Geographical Society members-only establishment in London, is similarly enjoying tea and a type of spicy cake he came to enjoy in Istanbul, when his mentor and many times sponsor Edward McDougal, takes the opposite seat after carefully pouring himself two fingers of brandy.\n\n\"Andrew! Good thing I caught you. How much do you know about Lord Byron?\"\n\n----\n\nLady Emilia has just finished the laborious process of putting herself together for the day, when Beth walks in with a note inviting her to visit her teacher and mentor, Lady Katerina Lannigan, dowager baroness of Lannigan and iron fisted matriarch of a vast host of children and grandchildren. After a (ridiculously) short carriage ride, Emilia is shown into the drawing room by a most serious little boy she suspects is one of Lady Lannigan's great grandchildren.\n\n\"Ah! Emilia, my dear. How would you feel about a visit to the Museum?\"\n\n----\n\nCromwell is the first of the trio on site. The British Museum’s grand exhibition of artifacts from ancient Egypt is in full swing, and massive statues of Egyptian gods stand on either side of the entrance. The Museum has only just opened for the day, and Trentor finds himself in the sparsely populated lobby, joined only by a nanny with two children veering off in one direction, a trio of Greek gentlemen, and a couple of uniformed guards slash guides.\n\nStepping up to a counter to the side, he is informed that the Byron exhibit is certainly not open to the public yet and that Professor Worthington is curator for the exhibit. At his request, one of the uniformed guards is detailed to show him the way.\n\nLord Andrew arrives just as Trentor is leaving the hall, and receives much the same information, and the second guard for escort.\n\nLady Emilia arrives last, but doesn’t care to ask around for the assigned curator. Instead she racks her memory, and recalls that she was introduced to a Museum curator at a social gathering earlier in the Season. She asks and receives direction to Dr. Graves’ office.\n\nProfessor Worthington is perfectly happy to receive Trentor in his heavily cluttered office, and interrupts morning tea to receive his guest. Trentor’s player immediately Compels *This is too easy…* - the professor is a member of the Club, present to make things more difficult. Trentor settles in to form a rapport with the professor to gain access to the exhibit. But when Lord Andrew arrives and is similarly invited and has a hard time of following the socio-historical literary analysis, Trentor’s player Compels his Conviction *Science! Abolish Ignorance* - Trentor feels compelled to make the conversation as lengthy and in-depth as possible to teach the adventurer something truly useful. The professor is only happy to oblige.\n\nMeanwhile, Lady Emilia’s strategy is considerably more effective. After being invited to Graves’ office she easily learns he is distraught over the difficulties of funding his research and potential exhibits on central african cultures - something about half naked women and primitive stone tools not constituting a moral and educational topic (“Which is a terrible injustice! It is a matter of culture! Totally! If only I had the funds I could bring up authentic tribes~~wo~~men for the exhibit to show everyone wrong!”). Emilia easily charms the poor man with her considerable charisma and her father’s even more considerable wealth (“I should speak to my Father about a donation”) and in short order she has convinced him to show her the archive for cultural artifacts, with a small side trip on the way for the not yet opened Byron exhibit (“I hope you will excuse my weakness for his poetry”).\n\nHowever, after gaining admittance to the exhibit, she cannot find the notebook in the collection. While her search is only cursory, with Dr. Graves impatiently hovering nearby, she is satisfied the book is not there. On the way out, she runs into the trio of Greeks, who are saddened to learn that the exhibit is not yet open. They had great respect for Lord Byron due to his contributions in the Greek war of independence. Lady Emilia is then hustled off to the African Archive, located in a separate building, followed by viewings and demonstrations for the next several hours.\n\nCromwell and Lord Andrew’s efforts with professor Worthington finally bear fruit, as he promises to show them the the exhibit. At least after he’s finished telling them an amusing anecdote about the 3rd Baron Byron over lunch.\n\nThe two are indeed shown the exhibit, though the professor is unfortunately called away. They carefully examine the room, but find no trace of the notebook. Trentor takes a seat to consider things carefully, while Lord Andrew returns to the lobby hall, reaching at the same time as Lady Emilia, just back from the archives.\n\nThey reach the hall just in time to learn the shocking news: Professor Worthington has been stabbed.\n\n*Character limit*",

        "text": "So this particular story actually happened just tonight, and honestly it was quite an amazing moment for the whole group. I am DMing a game with friends, and the current party consists of a Half-Orc, three Half-Elves, and an Undine. Three of the these players are brand new, something I value in that new players are generally more likely to think outside of the box in many situations simply because they are not sure of the actual rules or details in a lot of situations. Tonight, that very thinking accomplished something amazing.\n\nThe party had been shipwrecked not long after discovering an unpleasant cult. They are quite desperate to escape so that they can warn the authorities of the land that robed men are up to dastardly deeds (robes are always bad, am I right?) So while the captain stayed on the beach to continue searching for survivors and supplies, the party is sent into the jungle to find out more about their location.\n\nIt didn't take long for the group to discover that this island was just chock full of unpleasant surprises. The first was finding a giant crab. Fortunately, it wasn't too interested as it was already eating pieces of another crewmate. They noted its presence and moved on. The second was a surprise encounter with assassin vines. This resulted in what I described as a \"Jack Sparrow-esque high legged run through the jungle\" as the creatures ate two more crewmates and nearly strangled a party member. A quick rest and some healing, and the group was ready to keep going. They didn't want to return empty handed after all.\n\nNow we get to the true fun. This half beaten party is only level five, so the extended difficulty of a shipwreck, waking up on shore, and a beatdown by murderous plants was taking its toll. They had stopped to rest at a river when the spellbreaker noticed a trail leading off further into the jungle. More importantly, a human made trail. Following it, they came across a set of footprints only a couple of days old and decided to see where they led. Now, this next part I'm going to describe as I told it.\n\n\"The trail leads through the jungle, and the trees begin to thin. Finally, you come to a small hill where a single tree stands alone. The hill is a gentle slope, and you can see that the tree at the top is quite large. In fact, it even looks healthier than the rest of the trees. At the base of it sits a hooded figure, apparently snoozing in the shade.\"\n\n(Swashbuckler) \"Well... lets go up the hill guys. Maybe he knows something.\" General agreement.\n\n\"You begin to climb the hill, enjoying a gentle breeze. The old man doesn't respond to your calls, so you walk briskly upward. You stumble over the arm for a second, but other than that it's easy go...\"\n\n(party)\"The WHAT?! What arm?! You never said anything about an arm!\"\n\n\"Arm? What arm? I said you stumbled over the tree root a little on your way up.\"\n\n\"Uh... no... you definitely said arm.\"\n\n\"Don't be so paranoid. You continue up the hill, still trying to get the old man's attention, but he is sleeping very soundly. Slipping in the wet blood, you continue to climb this hill.\"\n\n(party)\"BLOOD?!\"\n\n\"Blood? What are you screaming about? It's just leaves. Jeez. What's wrong with all of you today?\"\n\n(party starts coming around) (Spellbreaker) \"... Shit.\"\n\nSo the group had wandered into a hangman's tree, and every single one of them had failed their will saves vs. the hallucinogenic pollen. Of course, the spellbreaker finally started figuring it out, and snapped out of it with a will save in time to see the first vines noose around a few of his friends. The resulting fight was above their rating, and the tree was throttling three of them at once before they all became aware of the danger. With a desperate struggle, the Spellbreaker and Cleric managed to free their Ranger.\n\nHowever, by this point, three of the characters were in single digits, two were still hanging in the tree, and the cleric and spellbreaker couldn't hold out much longer under the onslaught of branches and vines. The tree cracked open its trunk to devour the Swashbuckler, who was being throttled by a noose-vine. It looked like the party would lose at least two players at this rate, and there wasn't much option but to flee. Then came those magical words every DM loves to hear...\n\n(Ranger, and new player) \"Hey... what would happen if I fed a tree a ring of sustenance?\"\n\nComplete silence. (me) \"Uh... you don't know... and neither do I...\" Now, normally it takes a ring of sustenance a week to work, but this was so goddamn amazing I just couldn't help but see if he could pull it off. In the end, the ranger makes a great throw, lands this ring in the maw of the tree, and the resulting satiation causes the tree to lose interest in eating the party, which means that they were free to collect their strangling friends. The newbie saved two party mates with an amazing idea. I have never had a single experienced player consider feeding a ring to a tree. xD",

        "text": "I was NPCing a short larp as part of a larger continuity, fairly standard fantasy setting based around ancient rome/greece. One character has been kidnapped and the others need to gather 12 talismans by defeating necromancers throughout the day.\n\nNecromancers 1, 2 and 3 were accompanied by 2 skeletons, and now it's time for necromancer 4 to go out and this time we want 4 skeletons. This is where the first silly thing happened, because we had 3 spiffy looking evil skeleton masks and 2 rubber ones. What we hadn't realised was that once you put the rubber one on someone it made them into the happiest looking skeleton on the planet. So when the skeletons lined up to go it went something like \"grr. \"grr.\" grr.\" \"hello!\"\n\nIn an attempt to reduce the silliness we gave the Happy Little Skeleton mask to the taller guy and gave him a hood. Four skeletons and a necromancer (me) ready to go.\n\nFor the last few necromancer appearances the larpers had been indoors, and one person had been sent in to say the alarm had been sounded from wherever the necromancer was walking outside (we were at a scout camp, it was raining a lot, encounters were outdoors in gaps in the drizzle). This time they'd decided to post sentries all over as soon as the rain let up, so instead of scrambling out of the lodge they spotted us as soon as we came on scene. Unfortunately they were at the top of a slope and basically had us surrounded. We would have been flattened. \n\nSo I muttered to the skeleton entourage, \"just keep walking\" and we ignored the hell out of these twenty heavily-armed greek warriors aiming swords, arrows and spears at us and walked right through the middle of them.\n\nIt worked! But now we had to figure out where to go, and the GM was busy giggling to himself at the poleaxed expressions of the larpers so we just kept walking slowly down the path. The larpers at this point had a whispered argument and miraculously decided they were going to follow us and see where we went because obviously this was some kind of clue. So we walked the entire length of the campground, the larpers getting more and more confused and the NPCs desperately trying to keep straight faces until the GM recovered enough to tell us we shouldn't go farther than the bridge because it would be too slippery to be safe up there.\n\nTen minutes of walking and poker-faces later we hit the bridge, and  it's perfect. I turn around and order the skeletons to attack, and now we have the high ground on a narrow path with wooden railings on both sides so they can only come at us two at a time. \n\nTheir faces when they realised we'd just kept walking until we had the high ground advantage, there was no clue, and they'd let us all waltz on past and destroy any kind of formation or tactic they'd set up were priceless.\n\n\n",

After an empty connecting room, the party comes across a room with a large arcane sigil painted on the floor. While Rax debates casting Detect Magic, Gashur shrugs and enters the room. He crosses the sigil, stops, and swings his club. Unbeknownst to his party, a struggle has taken place for control of his mind… and his will is strong enough to resist the alien intelligence that has invaded his person.\n\nAs a dungeon created by a mad scientist obsessed with creating dark creatures for his won purposes, this one was a foregone conclusion.  I also wanted a different kind of challenge – the enemy is one of you, you cannot just cut him down. \n\n&gt; Swinging weapons in air is having some effect, but no one can tell what. Suddenly Arler stops, his eyes go black and a deep voice issues from his open mouth (but with no articulation of teeth or tongue) \"AT LAST… NEW FLESH.\" Arler turns on his teammates. He turns aside Gashur's warclub effortlessly, and Imlin's attempt to disarm him is reversed upon him, the assassin's scimitar flying into a corner. Rax casts sleep on the cleric, and he collapses to the ground. Arler's true battle begins behind his closed eyelids.\n\n&gt; On the blank stage of his mind, Arler finds himself facing a smear of solid darkness, peering through red slitted eyes. He also feels another presence just behind him. As the hidden presence approaches, he launches himself at the darkness. A struggle of wills ensues, and Arler disperses the being to the void whence it came. His companions discuss what to do next, and start to move with the Ogre carrying the cleric on his back. Arler awakes soon after, and joins the rest under his own power.\n\nThey came up with the non-lethal damage strategy almost immediately, and when Arler went to sleep he extemporised his internal mental battle, and I ran with it. He even added the second presence in there, hinting at his secret backstory! Planning is for chumps, it would seem.\n\n&gt; Passing through a small antechamber, the party encounters an impressive iron door, engraved with warnings about Ligo's power, and his long memory for those who cross him. As the party enters, they hear a low, constant hissing of indeterminate origin… and interrupt four beings surrounding a low purple mound on the floor. These creatures may have nonce been human, but the grey cast of their skin and their sewn-shut mouths, noses, eyes and ears suggest that they have become something… other. Whips unfurl, and the party launches themselves at the hostile – but eerily silent – foe.\n\n&gt; Lashed by whips, the party begins strongly, Rax and Arak nearly finishing one of the figures in a single, terrible joint attack. One of them, though, has other ideas. He takes a medallion from under his shirt, and it begins to glow in his grasping hand. The low, purple mound begins to move… and to rise. A tentacled, beaked horror reveals itself as the source of the now overwhelming hissing noise. It swings its slimy tentacles at the party, damaging some and terrifying all. \n\n&gt; The Ogre, after a swift mental review of resources, pops the top off a flask and chugs its contents.  He begins to grow, soon matching the Horror in size. They lock in a pitched battle of strength, while Rax casts sleep to disable to Horror's handlers. The battle is furious but swift – our party stands amongst its vanquished foes, drenched in the black ichor that fuelled the cancerous monstrosity.\n\nThis was the big boss. A straightforward battle, but intense and super fun for all that.  The use of the Enlargement Potion was a great idea, and it really felt like a battle of titans. And Sleep was finally paying off for Rax after last session's inability to cast. I was determined to drench them in gross yuk, so when it perished it exploded.  Why not?\n\n&gt; In the recessed floor that held the Horror, beneath a trapdoor, Imlin finds a large iron box, cubical and featureless aside from the two rings on the side obviously meant as handles. It is heavy, and the weight shifts slightly when the box moves.  There are no seams, no locks, no latches, yet it clearly contains something. Convinced this is what their *ahem* employer is seeking, the Ogre lifts the box and they make their way to the original rendezvous point, eager to put this bad business behind them.\n\nAt this point, we were reaching hard deadlines for leaving, but everyone wanted loot.  I cut out an encounter I had planned for on the way back to the meeting place (I'll use it next time!) and got them straight to the closing scene.\n\n&gt; When they arrive at the abandoned warehouse, Graeling – Vorner Rahe's incorporeal amenuensis – is waiting for the group. He explains that, despite his master's reservations (and his own conviction that you would be dead already) the party has performed well above expectations. He reminds the group that while they have already felt the firm hand of their master wielding the stick, he also finds value in the judicious use of the carrot. He steps aside, revealing four ornate wooden boxes of various sizes, each engraved with an initial.\n\n&gt; The members approach the boxes and open them in turn – Feather Step Slippers for Imlin, a magical ring of protection for Rax, culturally significant iron bands for the Ogre's warclub naming ceremony – until Arler is left. Instead of opening his box, he offers and ultimatum. He explains that if compelled, he will fight Rahe at every turn, becoming a thug at best, and useless at worst. He offers his willing assistance to Rahe, in exchange for a measure of autonomy. Graeling begins to protest and threaten in the same breath, but is stopped by an unseen (and unheard) other party. He informs Arler that his terms are accepted, and bids the group to disperse, and await further contact.\n\n&gt; It would seem that Vorner Rahe has plans for these four…\n\nAll in all, a really enjoyable couple of sessions. Now I have to start working on the next adventure. A daring heist, perhaps…",

        "text": "Continued from [Part 1] (http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/226gex/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/) &amp; [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/226hwt/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/)\n----\n&gt; After an uncomfortable night sleeping in the storeroom, our heroes (Rax the Drow summoner, Imlin the Elven assassin, Arler the human cleric and Gashur the Ogre barbarian) continue to explore the Barrow of Ligo the Horrendous. The exit to the storeroom opens into a room filled with writing desks, dark figures sitting motionless behind them. Investigation reveals the figures to be humanoid columns of ash, which crumble at a touch. At each desk is a parchment in process of transcription – some containing propaganda pieces regarding Ligo, others outlining steps from dark experiments.\n\nSomeone obsessed with creating a new branch of knowledge would be obsessive about documenting it.  And such a monstrous ego would of course begin writing his successful history well before it was strictly necessary. I managed to get the party VERY worked up about the motionless grey figures… until one of them bumped a table and it collapsed to dust. A great RP moment!\n\n&gt; From the scribe room, the party proceeds into another (formerly) functional space: overturned stools; long tables with arcane symbols on them; broken glass and the occasional unbroken retort or flask; the shattered remains of a chalked slate. The most telling detail is that the symbols on the tables are small magical flame generators – arcane Bunsen burners. The party has stumbled on Ligo's laboratory.\n\nI designed these rooms to evoke a feeling more than anything – there was no treasure to speak of, no monsters to fight. The tension was ramped up pretty high here, and despite me providing no direction, they found these rooms at just the right point, and in a useful order.\n\n&gt; Following their own hand-drawn map, the party decides to backtrack to the East, and finds a nest of Giant Spiders! Gashur is poisoned, but Rax steps forward and declares that he won't be attacked. He proceeds to leap onto the back of one of the animals, bringing it under control… to the astonishment of his peers. A quick sleep spell neutralises the rest, and the threat is dispatched (but not before Rax can milk some very useful spider venom).\n\nAs soon as I saw the Drow race ability to ride spiders, this rom was a foregone conclusion.  If they had missed it, I would have shoehorned it in somewhere because a giant spider mount is too cool for school. The poison was worrying to everyone, as it was hitting them HARD. The player who had the drow played this scene for all he was worth, casting sleep frantically to ensure he could at least get samples before the party killed them.\n\n&gt; The party (along with Rax's new mount Arak the Weaver) continue through the barrow, only to find another nest of arachnids… this time with grabbing claws and poisonous tails. The party fights valiantly (despite some unfortunate crossbow work by the assassin), but with the help of Arak the scorpions are dispatched forthwith.\n\nThis was my first real test of balance. I did not realise how strong these were until the party started fighting them, and began getting absolutely reamed. I started thinking about how I could nerf the encounter before a TPK when the Drow/Spider combo started wiping the floor with them. The spider's bite was vicious (1d8+3) and proved a tonic for the rest of the party. \"We are going to die!\" quickly turned into \"We could win this!\" and the rallying from the players was a genuine pleasure to watch.\n\n&gt; A portcullis with an elaborate opening mechanism is at the end of the north exit corridor, and a stone wall with an iron ring mounted in it is visible through the bars. Rax attempts to open the door, but triggers a (unusually working) pit trap. With no spikes at the bottom, Rax and Arak take some damage but manage to climb free (spiders are useful!). The Ogre is able to open the bars, and they enter the room with Arler the cleric at the forefront. A calm, peaceful feeling percolates through the party as they enter, and it becomes clear that they have found a prison cell, and it is occupied. As they approach the hunched, blanketed figure manacled to the wall (with both chains and magiks), and each character sees a female figure of breath-taking beauty – but each sees their own race's version of that beauty (the drow sees short white hair and black skin surrounding a thin, sharp face, the ogre sees green skin, a strong jaw, and thick, lustrous black plaits of hair, etc.). A beguiling and delicious smell suffuses the room. Deft pickwork by the assassin releases the manacles, and the being begins to glow with a divine light. She thanks the travellers, and reveals that she has been confined so long that she has forgotten her name, and is nearly out of power. She can grant a boon in gratitude: wealth, power or wisdom. She is pleased at their choice of the third option, and offers them information that Ligo spent his years attempting not to summon creatures from the darkness to do his bidding, but to create such creatures from the very fundament itself, ensuring control over these beings. His successes await the party, and a pure heart will defeat them. She peacefully dissipates, her last act one of charity and gratitude.\n\nAs one of my central set pieces, I had a lot of fun with this one. Ligo managed to capture an angel, but didn't know what to do with it. It wasted away in this cell for centuries, slowly fading away.  It was a point when a full healing and permanent +1HP bonus was heartily welcomed. What I had not anticipated was the players RPing the 'enthralled' state so vigorously – they were suspicious immediately, but also immediately attempted to release the being.  No compels from my side of the table.  I was so proud!\n\nConcluded in [Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2362g6/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/)!",

        "text": "I am currently running a small game (three players) with a fairly simple background plot-device: Elven zealots use the stars to read fortunes, and human astronomers or 'skymancers' predict in advance that after 4 months, the elves will be \"ordered\" to wipe out humanity.\n\nThe party are residents of a human city (not murderhobos!) who are three amongst many trying to save the city.\n\nAfter a prolonged battle with a spellcaster from the previous game, the party tracks down the slain spellcasters base - A tower with a magical orb on the top floor which enhances all magic within it. A ring of cat's grace and a ring of invisibility had given this spellcaster an invisible, moving tower.\nThe party figure this tower will be a valuable resource for fighting elves, so they head on down and start battling up through hordes of undead and a lesser spellcaster who kept fleeing upwards to the next floor before they managed to finish him off.\n\nThe party's ranger had shot two crits into the spellcaster, and was a little upset he hadn't killed it yet, which is fair as he was the newest player.\n\nThe other two party members (fighter and sorcerer) had gone on a previous quest in this world, where they received cursed arrowheads - a former sword containing an ultimate evil, which had been reforged to rob it of some of its power. The evil is legendary in game, so they have not letting anyone - even the third party member - know what it truly is, incase carrying such evil around turns the populace against them. The fighter occasionally uses an arrow as a makeshift stabbing weapon, as they are incredibly powerful.\n\nMaybe you can see where this is going?\n\nWhen they reach the top floor, the undead spellcaster rushes into the orb and his spirit merges with it. He becomes one with the tower, a fun 'fight the room!' boss battle I'd designed.\n\nThe ranger gets initiative, rolls to rob a demon arrow from the fighter and shoots that reforged ultimate evil into the orb.\n\nThe ranger cheers and is delighted both IC and OOC, while the other two players stare at him in horror.\nHis character passes out, as -unbeknownst to him but known by the other two players - the arrow drains health from the user with ever swing as the weapon tries to suck the life from its wielder.\n\nI redesign the room battle on the fly, as a powerful demon bound into that arrowhead pulls the rest of the quiver into the orb and grows more powerful than it's ever been.\n\nI've never seen more horror on my player's faces as when they sat in a moment of silence and realized they'd escalated acquiring a tower for their cause into rebirthing a demon named 'Souldrinker', which had been contained by the heroes of old who'd lacked the power to destroy it, and made it more powerful than ever.\n\nThe tower ports itself to the middle of an innocent city, pouring out undead into a gathering of halflings.\n\nSouldrinker explains he is going to annihilate all life, city by city, plane by plane.\n\nThe sorceror rushes to the orb and tries to use magic device to navigate away to elven lands, hoping to at least decimate people the party doesn't like.\n\nThe fighter has lost his arrows, but his other weapon is a magical greatsword that adapts to the properties of whatever it hits, gaining a stacking +chance to hit that caps at 2.\n\nI'd just like to say, I was running this all off the top of my head and hoping we didn't Total World Kill.\nThe sorceror rolls a 20 on use magic device, so I allow him to understand how to shift into the orb and be standing next to the demon. He tries to limit it's wrath and explain that if he kills everyone at once, there'll be no death left - I liked the effort and started designing things in that direction as quickly as I could, making sure to not pause as I've never seen my party so excited or co-operative in their OOC planning\n\nMeanwhile, the fighter tried to leap into the orb after the sorcerer, but lacking comprehension he thudded into it. I remember his buckler (strapped to his arm) was a lesser holy item, so as it touches the orb I make it freeze in place as the celestial runes along it re-write themselves.\n\nI then narrate the scene every high-level spellcaster they'd met going into a trance -regardless of alignment - and focusing on making this item the most powerful holy object they could\n\nThe shield on the orbs surface casts a light into the orbs interior realm, and the sorcerer stands in that light, becoming blessed with the powers and knowledge of all the spellcasters around the gameworld (including the deceased ones, helping from other planes of existence) desperately trying to save life.\n\nAs the shield breaks off and become a beacon for others to help them, the fighter uses his greatsword to strike the orb multiple times. I say that, having adapted, it strikes open a gap in the surface that he can crawl through, maintaining his physical form in the spirit realm without being magical.\n\nHe crawls in as the sorcerer holds the demon back with the magic of all the friends and enemies the party had ever made (and foreshadowing of some they had yet to meet!) as the warrior walks up and uses his adaptable sword to cut this demon apart with it's own essence.\n\nTL;DR - Shit got real crazy, then I got real proud",

        "text": "So, Descent is basically a casualized DnD. You don't really make your characters,  but pick a card with your stats done for you already. It has similar dungeon-crawling aspects, plenty of dice to roll, and a DM.\n\nAnyways, our party consisted of me as Trenloe the Strong, who was designated tank, and had a thing for referring to himself in the third person, Mad Carthos, who was basically a useless hobo who was supposed to be our offensive caster, Andira Runehand, our healer turned mage, and finally Steelhorns, a seven foot tall minotaur armed with massive blades and chainmail was our melee DPS.\n\nNone of our special abilities really did anything cool, for me it was that I could reroll a dice of my choice whenever. But Steelhorns, oh boy Steelhorns. His ability is that he can rush up to 4 tiles, giving him an extra attack, along with his normal one. (Or so we thought, the rules were sorta vague.)\n\nWe make our way through with little difficulty, except for one run-in with a rather nasty Flying Behemoth.\n\n&gt;Trenloe slowly creaks open the door, listening intently for anything out of the ordinary. \n\n\"Trenloe hears nothing down the hallway.\" he mutters, as he reaches down to grab his weapons, one an old relic blade made of bone, the other a shield made of crystal. Yet as he lets go of the doors latch, a click sounds out into the near-silence of the group, and a fireball erupts where Trenloe stood. He merely grunts, wipes off some soot, and looks back at the group, when he steps forth into the hallway. As the group forms up behind him, Andira whispers.\n\n\"I sense a large presence ahead.\" As she finishes her sentence, the group realizes that in the low light, what they thought was a statue, was really a giant chimera-like creature, with wings that spanned across the room. Why it chose to be hanging out in a cramped sewer, we couldn't figure out, but it was there nonetheless. \n\nMad Carthos stammers \"M-maybe we should let Trenloe lead the way.\", which Trenloe agrees with, since that means more gold for him. \n\nBut Steelhorns was off in his own world, as a red mist fills his vision, his breathing gets heavy, and he draws his massive two-handed scythe, yet another old relic known for both its massive weight, and its ability to punch through armor like paper. \n\n\"Ok, I am thinking I'll just try to keep it stunned as much as possible, Trenloe can engage, then Steelhorns can come in and do what he does-\" Andira tries to formulate, as the massive minotaur lets out a bellow, alerting everything in the room, and he goes spinning in not so dissimilar from a rogue blender. He starts with a Beastmaster that made the mistake of getting in his way, cuts through his midsection like a knife through butter, and using the momentum of both the initial swing and his massive weight, slams into the behemoth ahead, planting the huge blade into its upper leg. It bellows in pain, as it brings down a clawed hand into his back, swiping him onto the floor. Steelhorns then gets shot in the side by an unseen Skeleton, as he tries to pick himself back up, and then gets pounced on by a second beastmaster. He finally kicks it off of him, and rolls out from under the behemoth, while wrenching his scythe free.\n\n\"Trenloe thinks Steelhorns is in trouble.\" The Strong quips, as he shuffles in behind, slightly out of breath from his massively heavy gear.\n\n\"Well no shit.\" Andira replies. Carthos takes a seat on the floor, legs curled beneath him, staff at his side. He could contribute, but he was a little tired from having to perform telekinesis so many times. He yawns and lays down, fast asleep.\n\n\"Trenloe also thinks we should abandon the hobo at the next available moment.\" he says nonchalantly, while making his sweet way to the battle occurring ahead.\n\nAndira sighs, then replies \"Yeah, you are right.\" She preps a quick spell, and blasts the Behemoth with it right before it smashes Steelhorns head with a quick jab. It stuns him, and gives Trenloe enough time to both deal with the Beastmaster standing over the Minotaur, and then smash the Skeletons skull with his shield. Steelhorns stands back up, takes his scythe, and swings at the last creature in the room, but in so much pain he puts his scythe into the floor next to its foot. It looks at him with what could be pity for a second, then stomps him into a small puddle.\n\nTrenloe reaches back with his blade, and smacks the beast in the small of the back, causing it to bellow and turn. It swings its tail while doing so, knocking Andira off target with her stun spell, sending it wide into the nothingness. This yell wakes up poor old Carthos, which makes him cranky.\n\n\"Hey you stinky, hairy son of a bitch!\" he screams, in his feeble old man voice. The beast looks at him quizzically. He pulls his arm back, and hucks his old staff at the thing. \n\nIt strikes him critically, square in the eye. It screams for about five seconds, then collapses onto the floor. \n\nAndira stops, hands still raised in a position to cast, drops them to her sides, and says \"Are you serious. The hobo just killed that thing with his staff. Not even a spell, just his staff.\"\n\n\"Well, I threw it using telekinesis.\" \n\n\"Trenloe thinks he hates this place.\"\n\nThe two ferrets, Mata and Kata, owned by Andira, scurry into the room, grabbing all the gold and hauling it to the heroes. \n\nThe three, now joined by the freshly re-kitted and respawned Berserker, gather their thoughts and proceed to enter the next hall.\n\nNinja edit: Wow the formatting in this place is cool. I normally just lurk and read from mobile.",

        "text": "(I posted this to /r/gaming a while ago but realized it would better be served here.)\n\nI was replaying Bioshock as I tend to do on occasion, along with many others, and up to about half way it was just standard fun. Where it started to get interesting was when I started my journey through Fort Frolic and obliging the whimsey of that artistic lunatic Sander Cohen.\n\nThe third checkpoint in the construction of his masterpiece was upon me after finishing a few of his cronies and former students. I sat in judgement of his unfolding piece of art, garnering his explosive ire, but what else could be expected?\n\nUp to this point in the game I was bouncing between plasmid and weapon combinations in search of the most entertaining. As it happens I had chosen pure fire in this particular area of the game. The ability to set enemies ablaze and reduce them to ashes with nothing more than a flick of my wrist piqued my interest for a few moments.\n\nBack to the game. Cohen was starting his rant of being judged and let loose his waves of minions upon me. That's when something magical happened.\n\nThe lights went dim, the spot light singled me out, the music started, and I was struck with inspiration. The music that Cohen selected for this dance of carnage was Tchaikovsky's Waltz of the Flower. Suddenly I wanted to, no... I was compelled to start dancing! Enemies started pouring in from the entrances and the ceiling while I began to twirl. Spinning faster and faster I pirouetted up and down the stage snapping my fingers and immolating any poor splicers who drifted across my field of vision. I stopped aiming all together and merely let the flames leap from my outstretched arms to whom they desired.\n\nA cacophony of screams from the splicers filled the room and I was the conductor of this incendiary concerto. Tchaikovsky's musical genius grew louder and louder reaching its climax, blending in my mind with Cohen's frenzied, maniacal encouragement. I began cackling with my demented teacher and became more than a whirling dervish wreathed in flame. I became a spirit of the flame itself.\n\nAt this moment of insane bliss I realized that I am not working to complete Cohen's masterpiece, I am his masterpiece!\n\nOnce I reached this point in the game I knew I could go no further. I had turned a single player, story driven, linear game into an RPG where I chose not to save or condemn Rapture, but to fulfill my destiny as one of art's greatest embodiments. I turned off the program and uninstalled the game knowing I would never be able to take this game any further.",

        "text": "Our band of heroes finds itself at a loss as to what to do. In the middle of their quest to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the King of Tyribas, their Shadowdancer compatriot received sudden summons to visit his dearest grandmother, leaving the rest of the party without a tracker. To kill time while waiting for his return, the party turns to the Arena for excitement; the only alternative being lazing around the tavern with the (admittedly comely) wenches.\n\nA Divine Archer, a Vampiric Mage, and an Elven Gunslinger walk through the gates of the arena, confident in their ability to face the challenges of random hordes of monsters summoned from realms unknown. And, for a time, their confidence is justified - until they enter the lair of the Yuki-Onna. Four, to be precise.\n\nThe fight is long, bloody, and rife with close calls. Twice, the party is hit with cones of cold, coming to the brink of death only to be revived by a timely administration of channeled healing from the paladin (much to the chagrin of the vampire, who was lucky to resist the repulsive energy of goodness).\n\nThe Elf dodges off, firing his rifle as he runs, to try and draw off the ghouls. But then... another cone of cold, thirty feet in size, springs forth from one of the frozen maidens. Already injured, the Elf is reduced to the brink of death - a normal hero would be seconds from death and unconscious, but yet the Elf held on.\n\nFor this gunslinger was a hero of unmatched resolve. So long as he had his rifle in one hand and bullets in the other, he would fight on - and so he fought. Pinned to the wall by the torrent of ice, the Elf fires his rifle once again. The bullet flies true, piercing through the heart of the abomination, obliterating it. \n\nNot to be satisfied with a single kill, he turns - reloading the rifle deft hands of a master rifleman - and fires at the last foe in the arena. This bullet, like the one before it, flies with near supernatural precision; it tears through frozen flesh as if blessed with divine providence.\n\nThe gunslinger, exhausted and held up only by his will to keep fighting, has finished is last, spiteful act. An instant later, the final ghoul - now aware of his presence, having been distracted by the paladin earlier - crystallizes him in ice with the wave of an arm.\n\nAnd such was the final stand of the Elven Sniper, the Man in the Arena.\n\n------\n\n**tl;dr** Party is getting its ass kicked by frost undead. My gunslinger runs out to try and stop the 15-foot cone attacks, only to get blindsided by the realization that Yoki-Onno also have *30* foot cone attacks. Even with an ungodly reflex save, he takes half damage - enough to reduce him to the *brink* of death at negative HP, but with \"Never Stop Shooting\" he can stay up and fight (a la Diehard). He critical-kills one ghost, then lands a critical hit on the other before being immediately obliterated by the next cone of cold.\n\nOh, and the reflex save on that spell? Nat 1. Elf Sniper (no name given, *yet*) died with -63 HP at level 7.\n\nFor added comedy, as if horrific overkill wasn't enough, in the next fight the Vampiric Mage used only one spell: Unnatural Lust, cast on a barbarian rider with the target being his horse, *and vice versa.* Everyone was glad when they made their will saves.\n",

The stuff is indestructible, our rogue-type character had missed the session, and all we're left with is faces and fighters to figure a way out. And also our necromancer.\n\nNow our necromancer was new to the group, and new to roleplaying in general. He must have assumed that it was a drinking group with a few dice thrown in, because he had pregamed before coming over. There were two thermoses full of gin on the table and a handle of backup gin in his backpack. He was kind enough to share the hooch around, so no complaints. Still, the dude was lit.\n\nAnyway, this necromancer used to serve one of the big bads of the setting, and he still had a magic mirror that could send messages back to his Deathlord boss. You write a message in blood, the guy on the other end sees it in his own mirror. Easy enough. Since we were captured by highwayman ghosts his pickled little brain came up with a brilliant little plan. I imagine the thought process must have gone something like this: \"I know! I'll bluff the ghosts into thinking I'm still in league with my old boss. They're scared shitless of Deathlords, and if I spell out a kill order on my mirror they'll fall all over themselves letting us go. I'm so smart. I deserve more gin.\"\n\nSo with a big shit-eating grin on his face he tells us he's got this, then pantomimes holding up the mirror. He points with one meaty finger at the imaginary magic item, then he shouts at the top of his lungs, \"TERPINATE!\"\n\nThe rest of the table sits there in befuddlement. So do the ghosts. Thinking that we must not have heard him properly, he gestures insistently at the invisible fucking mirror in his hands and repeats, \"TERPINATE!\"\n\nWe glance around at one another like, \"What's he trying to tell us? What does this mean?\" It was an existential crisis on our end, and must have been damned frustrating on his. He proceeds to explain the plan. \"No guys. See, the mirror says 'terpinate.' Like a kill order, you know? They'll get scared and let us go.\"\n\nSomebody pipes up. \"Do you mean 'terminate?'\" And we all proceed to lose our collective shit. Necromancer laughs so hard that gin comes out of his tear ducts.\n\nThat was two or three years ago now. He became a regular in our group, and a pretty good gamer. He still giggles every time we shout TERPINATE at him.",

        "text": "I loged on the next day to find i had terrible lag. I was getting 5-7 fps in the city. The game was almost unplayable. Luckily another town resident who I will name Tim wanted me to see his house. Because of the lag (which I assumed was because of crappy computer being in the city) i was very eager to his house He gave me the coordinates which was roughly 1500 blocks from the city across an ocean.\n\nI made a boat and went on my way. I used to travel in minecraft was to go to the exact \"x\" point first. Then I would go to the exact \"y\" coordinates. It took me roughly half hour and when I got there Tim said \"sorry i have to go\". Well i took a look at his house. It was in a village that was half in the ocean and the usually minecraft village mess ups. His house was one of those pre-made minecraft village homes. I went home.\n\nI don't know why but at 11:30 pm my brain said to me \"hey aytos is really laggy, \"Orion\" is a bigger city so there wont be any lag because there is more people there\"! So I looked at my resource's crafted a full suit of iron armour, a diamond sword and a minecart. I went to the \"Aytos\" rail station, put down my minecart and went off.\n\nAfter a 5 minute travel i arrived at \"orion\". Just as a side note I have had to play the game at render distance 2 this entire time. So I climbed up the ladder to see 'orion\"! yes i saw all 2 chunks of this beautiful city in a full 2 frames per second. Then I crashed. I logged back on and i saw \"orion\"! well two chunks of it at 2 frames per second. It was bad. I logged off for the night. \n\nThe next day I traveled back to \"Aytos\" (some how) and logged off. I tryed to log on the next day but I still had terrible lag. I tried to divert more RAM available for minecraft but this only slightly helped. I logged off for the day. i spent the night thinking \"I wont be able to play civcraft anymore, and that's a real shame because \"my civcraft story\" was just getting its 4th part and was getting \"72% people liked this\".\"\n\nAlmost caught up with modern events guys thx for the support from all those people who up vote my stuff\n\nPart four: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/22doqy/minecraft_my_civcraft_story_part_4/\n\nPart three: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/228u6w/minecraftmy_civcraft_story_part_3/\n\nPart two: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2272ct/my_civcraft_story_part_2/\n\nPart one ( the crap one): http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/225rjv/my_civcraft_story_part_one/      \n\nEdit; im not posting anymore, not because of negative feedback or the fact that my computer handles minecraft as if its the titanic and minecraft is the iceberg (i downloaded optifine really useful btw), but because bugger all has happened since I joined the great city of Aytos. Nothing worth typing has happened. As soon as something does happen I might come back to this. \n \n ",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/22h4hd/eve_online_new_wormhole_neighbors_unwelcome_pvp/",
        "text": "This is a story from Eve Online that took place over the weekend and will be my first submission to /r/gametales. Eve is pretty complicated and I have chosen to not elaborate on some points because this has already grown from a game tale into a small short story. Still, I hope you enjoy! \n\n*New Neighbors Move In*\n\nOne of my Eve characters primarily lives in a wormhole. Saturday I logged in and found that another group of players had set up 2 bases, or personal orbit stations (POS), inside my wormhole. So I welcomed them like any good neighbor would, by popping an industrial trying to setup a POS, and then a few minutes later I caught a Retriever idly mining at an asteroid belt without a care in the world. Two easy kills. I was nice and ended up chatting with each of those players. They seemed nice too. I mentally decided I was OK with having new neighbors - it would be fun hunting / PVPing against them. Unfortunately, I don't think they were looking for PVP.\n\n*Mercs Show Up*\n\nA bit later a separate group of players show up and start camping the entrance to the wormhole. I started a conversation with them and basically let them know about the other group of players currently moving into the wormhole and that they might get some nice kills. I wished them happy hunting and left it at that. An hour passes and I don't think the merc group really got any kills. But then I get a conversation from the same guy, saying my new neighbors tried to hire the mercenaries to evict me, but since I talked to him first he would cut me a deal and \"just disappear\" for 20 million ISK. I figure this was a scam. The merc group only had ~4 people as far as I could tell, and reinforcing a medium POS with guns and ECM takes more, or access to larger ships, which is not an option in a C1 wormhole. Even so, I tossed the guy 40 mil because I figured I had enough on my plate already (I'm just one guy, albeit with two accounts), and I appreciated the work the mercenaries did of just scaring this group of wormhole-noobies. Mercs disappeared. \n\n*New Neighbors Move Out*\n\nI login the next day and find one of the two POSs my neighbors setup had been removed. I figured I'd cloak, AFK by the remaining POS, and see what would happen. So I fired up some Diablo 3 and waited. Eventually one of them shows up at the POS in an Industrial ship (1) . He talked in Wormhole local chat (2) and said something like \"Moving out would be easier if I knew you wouldn't kill me, or is your goal to be a dick\"? Well, in response to that, there IS pvp especially in wormhole space, and the game IS eve online, so I'm not really sure what you were expecting. So at this point I decided that yes, in fact my goal was to be a dick. I just wasn't sure how yet.\n\n*The Exodus*\n\nSo this guy starts slowly - and I mean really, really, terribly, slowly - taking down his POS guns. He would slow boat out of the POS shields in his Iteron (he didn't have a Microwarp drive, ugh) and pick up guns then go back inside. I could have killed him but I left it alone, looking for a better opportunity. I let him move most of his shit out. I did want the POS gone, and him unanchoring it was by far the easiest option. Then he ejects all his ships from his hangar - maybe 5 total - and starts moving them out. A friend shows up and helps. The friend arrived in a Harpy (a tier 2 DPS frigate). The pilot had to eject from the Harpy inside the POS shields to help move the other ships back to highsec. \n\nEventually, all the ships are gone except the Iteron, a scanning frigate, and the Harpy (still empty, and available for stealing, if those shields weren't in the way). Meanwhile, the entrance wormhole has reached \"End of Life\" and less than 50% mass remaining (3).\n\nAt this point my plan was basically something like this:\n- Wait for him to offline his POS and the shields to go down. When this happens, his ships (presumably the Iteron industrial and Harpy frigate) would become vulnerable for attack. I'd have to handle both with essentially 1 combat ship, which happened to also be a Harpy of my own.\n- Warp in with my cloaky ship, warp scram the industrial (my main goal, juicy target because I thought it would be carrying the tower), and also warp scram the tech 2 dps ship.\n- Simultaneously, warp in with my other account that can actually provide DPS and kill the enemy Harpy and Industrial. \n- Escape in my cloaky ship which would easily be destroyed, it's just there to 'tackle' for ~10 seconds while my other ship lands\n\nThe part I didn't know until now, because I've never taken down a POS, is that it takes 30 minutes to unanchor a medium POS. So when this guy clicked \"unanchor\" he essentially had to come back 30 minutes later and pick it up in his industrial, where he would be completely vulnerable - unless his friend in the Harpy defends him. Ok. Let's start the action.\n\nSo the Harpy pilot comes back in his pod, the Iteron is still waiting in the POS. The Harpy pilot gets in the Imicus, the very last ship, and warps to the wormhole. A weird choice, because the wormhole could expire and the Iteron would be totallly F'ed, but OK. A short time later the Iteron pilot moves down and offlines the POS. With the empty Harpy still sitting there, and the Harpy pilot outside the wormhole piloting the Imicus. DING DING DING! Opportunity knocks. At this point I also realize he has to wait 30 minutes to actually pick up that POS. \n\nMeanwhile, my main character Dom is 40 AU away outside of dscan, aligned to the POS in question. As soon as the POS goes offline I warp to within 20k on my cloaky character. The Iteron warps away randomly - I assume the shields going down but 30 minute timer to scoop the POS confused him. The Harpy is sitting there, alone, undefended. My main can fly Harpies - actually he was currently in one of his own. So I bookmark where he is, eject from my own harpy, and warp to 20k of my cloaky alt. I land 5k from the enemy Harpy, right-click, Board ship, and get away clean. I stash it in my POS without changing the name for the lols. http://imgur.com/x9jUtbE Gotta love the Dread guristas warp scram with meta 4 rails and a missing rig. Sweet fit. \n\nOk, so with the Harpy stolen my next goal is to find the Iteron. I prepare to combat-probe scan him down but a quick dscan reveals he's at a planet cluster. I warp to within 100k and land near him. My cloaky alt has a total of 6 points (3x warp disruptors, because fuck warp core stabs) so I prepare to engage. I figure at this point I should really pod him out of the hole so I trade the Harpy for a Flycatcher (can drop warp bubble to prevent capsules from escaping), spring the trap, and get the pod. My first time killing something in an interdictor (totally worth the train). \n\nAt this point as far as I knew there were no targets inside the wormhole. Based on their behavior of always leaving 1 person inside the wormhole and no one coming back for the missing Harpy. As I killed the pod he threatened he would \"just move back in\" since I killed him. I figured I'd make it tough for him and defend my entrance. So I immediately warped to my static in my flycatcher and a pvp Drake. Yeah, laugh it up, I love the Drake. Anyway, I slowly collapsed the hole by flying the Drake back and forth. It takes a while to close a C1 but a lot of ships had already passed through. About 45 minutes later I collapsed the hole, locking my new enemies out. Fortunately (and kind of randomly) both my pilots ended up back inside the hole. I picked up the now un-anchored medium POS for a cool 130 million, looted and salvaged the Iteron, and deleted my bookmark \"PERCH FOR FUCKING THEM\", which I made for providing the best warp in to land on top of the Iteron. I am great at naming bookmarks. \n\nLessons (hopefully) learned: There is PVP in wormholes (gasp). Don't move into an occupied hole unless you will stand your ground. Don't offline a POS while un-piloted ships are floating inside. Shield hardeners should be anchored *inside* not outside. You don't need to fly outside of your POS to anchor guns. That Harpy was terribly fit - no tank at all. Don't unanchor a POS unless you can defend the area for 30 minutes (this was also news to me). I learned just because pilots are years older than myself doesn't mean they are as dangerous. \n\nGood times were had by all. At least by me. \n\n(1) Indusrial ship: Designed to haul crap around, not for combat purposes\n\n(2) Wormhole local chat: Normally you can see all other players in 'local chat' so you know who is in the same system. In wormholes you cannot see who is in the system unless they chat. Since I didn't speak in wormhole chat the player had no way of knowing if I was present or not.\n\n(3) Essentially this means the wormhole entrance will expire soon and a new one will spawn elsewhere. It requires a scanning ship to find the new entrance/exit. This is why they kept the scanning ship inside until almost last - they were worried the hole would expire and they'd have to scan down the new one - a good idea on their part.\n\nKillmails are not yet on the killboards. Once they are they will show up here: http://eve-kill.net/?a=system_detail&amp;sys_id=5715, and I will try to update this post too. ",

My orcish blood allowed me to take in my dark surroundings; Iron bars, wooden floors....a rocking sensation. It seems i had been taken by some party, though the lack of windows left me a bit disoriented. I stood up, only to fall back down to my feet from that reoccurring rocking. Was i at sea? I was no stranger to captivity, but I've never been too fond of the ocean. As my eyes continue to adjust to the darkness i see i am not alone in my cell. Four others accompany me in my quarters; two men, one half-mer. Despite their uniformed rags, each of the characters looked quite diferent; one man young, one man hidden behind a large, bushy beard, and the half elf with smooth skin, eyes darting about the room as he sits against his wall. In the cell next to us i see my wolf, Bertrum, chained next to a large, bipedal mammal. My dog whimpers, but seems to have no fear of the large animal. \n\n  Eventually my eyes meet his, as we are the only ones whose eyes can accommodate the very small amount of light. He stares at me, and holds up five fingers, then silently counts down on his hands, on finger after another. Once he put down his last finger, he could hear a door open above us. Out side our cell was a set of stairs, which two men descended, both of them looking scraggly and unkempt. They briefly came to the cell door, then walked back up the stairs, closing the door behind them.\n\n  Upon the door closing, the half elf sprung to his feet and approached me. Still sitting myself, the pair of elven eyes looked down on me, and then held out his hand. In his small palm he held what appeared to be a nail. \n \n   \"They make rounds every twenty minutes. Frankly, i don't care to be here for much longer, and I'd imagine you feel the same\" His eyes moved to the nail in his hand \"Can you bend this?\" I raise an eyebrow to this \"If I have a lock-pick, even a makeshift one, i might be able to get us out of this cell\"\n\n   I pick up the nail, and bend it into an L shape. \"It'll do\" The man-eld said, as he turned to the cell door. He began to work on the large, iron padlock. \"You got a name? Mines Shellis\"\n\n  \"Yes. Shokk\"\n\n \"Strong name\" he replied, and as he finished his sentence, a small metal 'clink' was heard. \"Ha! Perfect\". He swung the door outwards, but I stopped him\n\n  \"Wait. Stay in the cell. Have an idea.\" Puzzled, he stepped back into the cell, the padlock in his hand \"And let me see that\" Then we waited, and just like clockwork the men opened the door and walked down the stairs. With the cell door closed, they didn't catch on right away. Only when right in front the bars did they notice the padlock was missing, but by that point, it was too late.\n\n Padlock in hand, I Charged at the gate with my shoulder, swinging the door open and hitting one of the men in the face. He fell to the ground while the other man drew his sword from his belt and swung at me. By sheer luck, the rocking sensation caused me to lose my balance, and i fell just under the blades swing. I didn't let this opportunity go to waste, as i swung the padlock at the man. His skull cracked as it was crushed between the iron bars and the padlock. \n\n However, still off balance, i fell to my knees. I heard the man who had been knocked over first get to his feet behind me. The sound of of his blade being drawn made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. However, the sound that followed were not what i expected.\n\n  While preparing to feel a blade in my back, what i heard was a few light food steps, three sounds of impact, and the sound of cracking bone. I turned to see the young man who was in the cell now holding the rugged man's now limp body up by it's neck. He dropped it to the ground, making a loud thud. He then held out a hand to me. After a moment of hesitation, I grabbed on by his wrist as he helped me up.\n\"Still not used to your sea legs, eh? Ha, the name's Daniel. Brother Daniel.\n\n  \"Working on them\" I replied. At this there was a sound from above, and a voice called down from the top of the stairs. \"Ay! Don! Garris! You boys finished? Capt'n wants a meeting with the crew? Fellas?\" Luckily the bodies were out of sight from the door. Brother Daniel quickly put a finger to his lips as he picked up one of the bodies, and pointed to the other. He  set the corpse down under the staircase and crouched in the shadows. I followed suit. Two more men hurried down the stair case. Luckily Shellis had closed the iron gate, and the men waled past it. However, they did see the blades and blood stains on the floor, which led their eyes straight to us. Daniel clenched his fists as the men drew their swords. Of course, this would be very unnecessary. \n\n  Hearing a loud metal sound, the two men turned around to look at  the cage behind them. The cage adjacent to our. The cage containing the animals. The large ape's hands pulled open the bars just enough to fit it's arm through, and that's all it needed. The monstrous arm grabbed one of the men by the neck, and viciously pulled the man against the bars. His body bent before going limp.\n\n  The second man dropped his blade and turned to the stairs, only to see Shellis, holding the blade of one of the fallen men. The man seemed to impale himself on the blade as Shellis gently trusted the blade into the man's heart. \"Shhhhhh\" he whispered, as he gently led the man to the floor. He laid the man on the floor, then closed his eyes. Shellis then looked over at at the bearded man and said \"The big fella belong to you?\", his eyes then looking over to the ape, now playing with the mangled body of the man. \n\n The man simply giggled, which grew into a hearty laugh. The men i surrounded myself were no doubt odd...but they seemed efficient. Which i appreciated. Which led me to my next question; how the hell were we going to get off this boat?",

        "text": "First time playing a tabletop rpg bloody good fun, playing with friends we all ended up doing ridicolous things.\n\nMy Dwarf ended up having an odd time i was playing a cliche angry, drunk, axe loving, goblin hating fighter.  Two things that caused some hilarity.\n\nFirstly the group was talking to a small party of goblins, the leader had lost an object deep in the dungeon want the group to go fetch.  Both myself and my character hadnt been paying attention so half way through this quest being given i turn to my friend and ask 'who are we talking too'.  he and myself had been drinking both in game and in real life,  So he responce 'just some goblin dudes'.\n'DIE GOBLIN FILTH' i scream,  this would of confused the goblins as they were happily and peacefully talking to us at this time.  I charge at the leader stopping to throw my axe at his face.  The GM is shaking his head at me calling me an idiot I roll a 1 ' you throw your axe with the power and accuracy of an untrained girl the peacefull confused goblins move to defend themselves' he says.  After a few rounds the goblins are all dead are wizard and cleric are very low hp.\n\nThis puts us in a real bad position for fighting the boss,  being noobs we have no potions the cleric had wasted her healing spells earlier on. Only me and the elf rouge have a chance of taking on the dragon and not dieing instantly,  after an entire game of general dwarf vs elf racial banter (v. cliche) we put our differences to one side shake hands and charge.  A real touching moment ruined by the next 3 rolls.  DM says roll for inititive elf gets 18 dragon gets 14 I roll another 1.\nElf boy charges with his dragonbane longsword (found in the dungeon i think the DM wanted us to have an easy victory first go around) and rolls a natural 20.  He confirms the crit and lands mega damage killing the big boss in one hit.  The DM sums up 'the two rivals make peace and face up to the greatest challange unfourtantly Marklar the dwarf after triping on his shoelaces completley misses Veridus burying his lonsword in the dragons heart up to the hilt. killing it in one for shame'\n\nmy final shame came later however the local mayoress is giving each of us our 500gp reward in the town square. As she hands me the pouch of gold i look at the DM and say 'mylady you can give me my reward but i would rather have you for the night'.  he says roll for the seduction but i had better roll high. I roll a 1.  After the group stops laughing the DM says 'you remove you cock from your trousers and wink at the mayor, before she can slap you in disgust you loudly shit your self in front of the whole town'  Needless to say I didnt receive any money for killing the dragon and i know have a permenant -3 Charism in the local area. Cant complain i didnt help in any constructive way. the goblins reward if i hadnt instigated a massacre would of been an item that would of been of extreme usefullness in the dragon fight.  Oh well the elf didnt need help.",

I had to get off for the night so I didn't get to see much of the city at this point.\n\nThe next day I started to post \"my Civcraft story\" on Reddit and loged on. I didn't really know the layout of the city so I asked Bob to give me a tour of the city. He happily showed me around the city and I was (somewhat) oriented with the city. During my tour of the city I asked Bob about some questions I had about civcraft. I had read the sub Reddit before I joined the server but I still had a few questions. The one I asked Bob was about \"The HCF war\". I learned that a bunch of (read the rest of this line in a sarcastic tone) hardcore minecraft PVPers from another server invaded and nothing could stop them because they were too good. Really guys, minecraft pvp is just if you can click faster and have a solid FPS. I got my minning tools and went digging just outside of the city.\n\nI started to dig with hopes high of finding large amounts of resources so I can start to build myself some better armour, tools and eventually a bigger house. I dug down to diamond level and started digging. Well I dug, and dug, and dug, and dug, and dug, and dug, and dug, and dug and dug. I spent three hours digging only to find 14 iron, 5 gold and three large chests of cobblestone. I asked Bob why I found such few resources thinking if one of the server's plug-in's made caused this. I was right. Resources  are much harder to come by in Ciccraft and the only way to to get resources is to get a job and work.\n\nI got a job as a tree cutter for the leader of the city. For every three stacks of log I cut down I earned one diamond, on a normal server I don't think three stacks of log is worth a diamond. Well whatever I wasn't going to question it was easy pay. While cutting down some tree's my axe broke so I went back to my house to make a new axe. On my way there some one typed \"cheifjames stop!\" I froze. 'cheifjame I place you under arrest...\" oh god what did I do i thought? \"by the fashion police\"! My minecraft skin is Master chief in a tuxedo. He told me I was a menace to fashion and to change my skin. I told him to screw off and went back to my job.\n\nLater that night I went home to find the \"fashion police\" vandalized my house with signs saying that I was wanted. I tore them down and logged of for the night. \n\nPart three: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/228u6w/minecraftmy_civcraft_story_part_3/\n\nPart two:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2272ct/my_civcraft_story_part_2/\n\nPart one ( the crap one):  http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/225rjv/my_civcraft_story_part_one/         \n   ",

The setting is an infinite mish-mash of planes coexisting kind of, created when the Feywild was pushed into the \"space between planes\", so to speak. Everyone has inherent magic to them, though some people(PCs and special NPCs)'s abilities are more pronounced.\n\nThe humans are living in opposition to nature, nature being the defining characteristic of the world. They live in an extreme sort of Capitalistic society, where most everything can be bought and as little government involvement. I was there for a time as a slave, and then later as a mercenary hoping to buy my family's freedom.\n\nThe human kingdom had decided they needed more land (didn't even make an excuse up) and declared war on the Elves (very socialist/communist society). The party said fuck that, and teleported (teleportation circle and an Elf wizard who studied in the capitol city).\n\nAfter some plot, we became the elf task force, hoping to assassinate the king and place someone more friendly onto the throne. There were a few caveats, largely being that they could just resurrect him. Well, as it happens, the party has a sword that can suck in souls and use them as casting components (the \"party\" being our questionably good aligned halfling). So the goal is: kill the king with the sword, and get out alive.\n\nSo we're given 4 small glass spheres. Three will summon a Gate upon shattering. One will summon a portal to the capitol.\n\nThe plan goes like this: group I for intrigue goes in and warns about assassins, carrying one sphere. Group M for *murder* goes in and waits where we think he will retreat, as we are told by an informant. Group I is composed of Amun, Xavier, and Sid. Group M is me, Anna, Seraphina, and Valenthi.\n\nThe plan went *ok*. \n\nWe gate in while the friends are talking to guards. Nothing terribly eventful at first, and I'm tuning out for the most part, being a weasle in Seraphina's pocket to avoid the chance of rolling a one. Valenthi puts up an invisibility aura, and we start going as guard activity picks up. That's a good sign, but they're out of my comm range, so party chat consists of group M for a time. Unfortunately, Anna, whose gift I never quite learned, but can guess at, rolls a one. Normally, with this DM, that just means you rolled a one. Well, Anna is Anna, and slips on some parchment. She's still in the sphere, however, so we chill for a moment while guards poke at where she was with halberds. Seraphina tosses a demon gate, which quells the guard's fear when they start popping imps.\n\nWe make it to the audience chamber suffering only one more case of parchment, and the find the king is calmly and confidently sitting on his throne. We decide he's not fleeing and whatever magic is on that bitch isn't worth dealing with. At this time, team M gets in and has tossed their gate while helping to kill the result, successfully bluffing their way past suspicion. Over party chat, we say we're going to chill at the guy's room until he gets back, and wait for the night under his bed or something.\n\nThe plan went less than ok.\n\nThere is his study behind the throne, with a staircase leading towards his room. His concubine is chilling in the study, but we manage to get past without arousing suspicion. From there, we get to his room no trouble, and wait.\n\nLater that night, we do a bit of dancing around his room while a wizard with true seeing looks around, and we discover a passage in the bathroom. We try and fail to disbelieve the wall, but decide it's not worth our time.\n\nSo the day comes to an end, the guard Captain and a buddy are chilling outside, and the king and his concubine are... being a king and concubine above our heads. Whatever. While this is going on, team I is starting a party downstairs -- they were confined to a room, but the guards were allowing the shindig because they didn't think team I was actually a problem.\n\nSeraphina watches their brains for sleep, but not close enough. Once the moment comes, with Anna and Seraphina poised to the two lives, the concubine wakes up and shouts \"ASSASSINS!\"\n\nSeraphina leaps at the king and nearly finishes right there. Anna strikes at the concubine, and whiffs, and now both pop out of invisibility. Valenthi jumps out from under the bed and readies tentacles once the door to the outside opens (Centered at outside wall to avoid catching us in the radius). The captain makes his save, but his buddy doesn't -- and starts singing. While the captain tries to drag the king away, the halfling holding to the king like death, I jump out and wall of stone the doorway to the hall and the bathroom.\n\nThe captain opens a new passage, and turns a corner. At my behest, everyone crams inside (like 4 spaces) and I wall off both progression through the passage and entry, leaving the concumonk sexbot (at first I thought she was some fleshy construct or something, because that was the human kingdom's big claim to fame) outside.\n\nInside goes fucking crazy. The concubine doesn't break through, but the far wall opens, though only a sliver of opening is available. Still, it's enough for line of sight, and the bard on the other side starts casting cures like the king's life depends on it. I stoneskin and try to block line of sight with my body (because fuck, man, I'm a druid in a tight space), but the guard captain blocks me, so I start tanking hits from him for a little while as our halfling is trying really hard to run the bard out of heals. Eventually, Valenthi does a call lightning, excluding only friendly targets, not including the king.\n\nHe goes unconscious, but the concumonk shows up to pull the king through the hole in the wall. Right then, a bunch of warforged (reflavored something else monsters that hit a shit load of times) break down my back wall. Anna takes Val's sphere, a demongate, and tosses it at a wall. Why? Crazy wanderer god of fucking crazy. Also like she thinks she can control them or something.\n\nSo that happens. The warforged wipe Valenthi from full to one health. Seraphina goes down right after, but I healing word her do the only thing I can think of: I polymorph the king into an ox, hoping to get him as heavy as I can make him as an animal that fits inside that hallway.\n\nAt this time, the guards are arriving, but haven't entered the fray. Anna takes Seraphina's sword, slips past the captain, and strikes the final blow to the king. Then the concumonk literally snatches victory away by disarming Anna and wielding the blade. I decide it's time to get out, healing word Val, grab the escape sphere from Seraphina (not her turn, and she's still prone), and watch as she gets taken out again. Anna is outside, and demons are appearing to my left, escape is behind me, the guard captain is in front of me, and death machines are to my right. The death machines finish me off first. I didn't survive the encounter.\n\nAnna manages to dance past the guard, out of reach of the concumonk (holy shit, that cunning action tho), and into the escape portal. She meets a number of armed elves, and pleads for help. A flimsy elf warrior goes through. Sure, good luck guys.\n\nShe goes down in a turn, but Sid arrives, having been pretending to drink for a while. He cast a mutli-taget heal, catching everything in the room and succeeding his bluff to look drunk. Seraphina gets up as Val, who amazingly hadn't gone yet since I had Healing Worded her, gets up, now much healthier. Seraphina pulls my nearly dead corpse through the escape, and Val disengages and GTFO's.\n\nI nearly make it, but I fail my last con save and die. Anna pops back through on the last second, saving the near-dead elf they sent to help us as the gate is collapsing. Sid made his bluff, but group I gets put in the dungeon still after they all mop up the last of the demons.\n\nI get resurrected, and quip, \"It's less dramatic if I make it!\", and get slapped by a crying Val.\n\nOn the other hand, I bet this makes up for accidentally trapping her next to a lich. The wall of stone giveth, and the wall of stone taketh away.",

        "text": "This one is early because i wont be able to post one tomorrow\n\nAfter dying from the side of the mountain I spawnded quite far away from \"Little Latvia\". I told Jim that I wont be able to make it there. I continued to travel and found my self near a town called \"Never Winter\". It was abandoned like every other city I found. I typed my usual \"hello is anyone there\" and I was greeted again. I asked him where the nearest town is and he gave me the link to the server map. My only thought was \"that would've helped an hour ago\". The map told me what city's where active and which ones where abandoned. Judging from the map the nearest town was \"Iria\". I was roughly 2000 blocks away. I took some wheat from 'Never Winter\" (replanted of course), got some wood and made some basic tools and I was on my way. \n\nThere was very little greifed settlements during my travels this time. I came across an ocean so I crafted a boat and sailed my way to \"Iria\". When I got within 200 blocks my only thought was \"is this going to be where all my traveling comes to an end, can I finally settle down\"? I arrived to find an empty town. I managed to find the town's message bored and there wanted list. I took a moment to read all of it and i'm glad I didnt settle there. Every wanted person's crime was being Norwegian or helping Norwegian's. \"Ok I only wandered into Nazi Germany\" I thought. I got back into my boat and started to head north (forgetting about the server map). When I ran out of food I just drowned myself to spawn else where.\n\nI spawned on a 10 X 10 island in the middle of the ocean. There was nothing there except for a sign that said \"Gonzo was here\". I'm assuming \"Gonzo\" used the one tree that may have spawned on the island to make that sign, made a boat and left that god forsaken island. I changed the sign to \"where the hell is civilization\" (If any of you find said island and find that sign put the answer to that question in the comments). I didn't hesitate as I drowned my self.\n\nI spawned outside \"Hobo city\" abandoned of course. I was on the verge of giving up on the server at this point. I hadn't found any sign of non-racist civilization in two days. I typed my usual \"hello is any one there\" to be greeted by three people. I explained my situation (new to server, been wandering around for two days) and they told me about the city of Aytos. I gave them my cords and one of them came to me and gave me food and a swiftness potion. He told me to follow him so I did and he led me to the city. He granted me citizen ship and gave me a house, more food and some wood. My quest was finally complete I found civilization!

She wants to be a part of everything even if she's no where near it. She wants to loot every body and room and never wants to share with the party.

        "text": "After I re spawned i wan in the middle of a field. After wandering around for a while I found a road with a sign saying Aurora city way point. This was my first sign of civilization since I found that floating sky city. I followed the road for several in game days. I passed the ruins of several cities, small griefed houses that i too shelter in to hide from mobs. It reminded me of fallout 3, a lone wanderer going though the remains of once \"great\" civilizations. I started to find more Aurora city checkpoints so I assumed i was heading the right way.\n\n My travels lead me to an ocean. I punched a nearby tree to get some wood and made a boat. I started to sail across the ocean typing every couple of minutes \"hello\" to try and get contact. I was mostly greeted by silence. After 10 minutes of sailing i was in an arctic biome at the base of an extreme hill. I sent my \"hello\" message and for the first time since i joined the server i was greeted by another persons hello. For the purpose of this story I will refer to him as Jim. \n\nWe talked for a while and he gave me the cords to the town he was in called \"little Latvia\". I started to head over to the cords he gave me. The only way to get there was to travel over the mountain. I climbed up the side of the mountain and got to the top. After traveling 50 blocks the mountain ended and i had to travel back down. After traveling down the mountain i was in a small valley surrounded by more extreme hills. I climbed to top of one of them to find more mountains and more valleys. The mountains were usually 50 blocks thick so every time I climbed a mountain I had to shortly travel back down. There were no trees in sight so I couldn't make a pickaxe. My current one was almost broken and I would only use it in emergency's. After half an hour of climbing over mountains and climbing down on the other side of said mountain i was getting close to my destination. There was only one more mountain in my way. I climbed to the top of this mountain, i could see \"Little Latvia\" in the distance. I started to dig straight down on the side of the mountain (breaking the one rule in minecraft and using my pickaxe thinking i was in the clear). I was half way down the side of the mountain when the block I broke led to nothing and I fell down. I had only half a heart left so a 15 block fall killed me. \n\nAfter dying twice now by climbing mountains I swore to never climb another mountain in civcraft  \n\nPart one: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/225rjv/my_civcraft_story_part_one/ \n\nPart three:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/228u6w/minecraftmy_civcraft_story_part_3/\n\nPart four:  http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/22doqy/minecraft_my_civcraft_story_part_4/       ",

        "text": "Continued from [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/226gex/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/).\n----\n&gt; As they exit the bar, and before they can get their weapons, they are accosted by a group of drunken dwarves looking for a scrap. As the group squares up, the cleric challenges the spokesdwarf to a one-one-one fistfight outside. His honour impugned, the dwarf accepts. The dwarf is bested, but his buddies are less than pleased.  Weapons are scrambled for, and a melee ensues.  It does not go well for the dwarves.  One of them is slashed in the chest, and the Summoner manages to cast Sleep on the few standing dwarves. The bleeder is stabilised by the cleric at the last moment, leaving 6 unconscious dwarves, a VERY angry landlord, and a group of Watchmen cleaning up the mess.  It is made clear that these dwarves are known troublemakers, and the group (after providing some details to the Watch) find lodging at a temple to the cleric's god, and avail themselves of the generous hospitality (and meagre accommodations) of the temple.\n\nThis was one of my key pieces, and I was both surprised and fulfilled.  I spent a good five minutes explaining the Ogre's historical cultural friction with dwarves right at the intro.  He wears Dwarven rings cut form Dwarven fingers braided into his hair, and his leather kilt is made of tanned Dwarven hides. I made this a THING.  I then completely failed to account for the possibility that he would STAND OUTSIDE THE BAR. Somehow, I had to get the fight into the street.  Then the Cleric steps up and does it for me!  It was glorious.  The dice seemed to know the Dwarves were drunk, and they fought terribly.  It was all the party could do to NOT kill them all outright. Then the Watch arrived (not in my original plan, but the only sensible outcome given the situation) and here is where I really dropped the ball - my only true regret of the evening. The cleric stripped to the waist, and I forgot HE HAD THE DAMN TATTOO. This town - and especially the Watch - would have SOME opinion on that, but it slipped past all of us. Ah, well. \n\n&gt; Under cover of darkness, the party travels to the location of the barrow… only to find an empty field.  After some exploring, they notice the taste of tin on their tongues.  Suspicious, the Summoner casts detect magic and finds the entrance to the barrow under a powerful glamour that makes it not only invisible, but incorporeal as well.  Approaching the entrance while detecting the illusion breaks it, and the party can see the giant status guarding a stone slab with an inset wooden panel. Using runes around the slab, as well as a poem scrawled on the back of the map, they are able to engage the magical lock and open the entrance to the Lost barrow of Ligo the Horrendous.  \n\nPride vies for bitter disappointment as the Cleric works out the correct sequence IMMEDIATELY. Preparation of mistaken attempts and eventual failure were never taken into account. \"It needs blood from all four of us. *slice* *dab*\" I was proud I had left the right clues, and bitterly disappointed that there was not even a hint of struggle there.  Harder puzzles next time (I rolled stats for those animated statues you breezed past, my friends, and I rolled then for NOTHING)!\n&gt; Down into the darkness the party goes, finding a zig-zagging tunnel acting a sa light trap.  On the other side, there is still light in the form of a blue, bioluminescent fungus growing in streaks on the ceiling. Careful checks of the initial corridor reveal a secret door, tempting them forward.\n\nI had forgotten about the secret door, and consequently the party missed a rotten, ineffective arrow trap I had set at the intended first door.  I wanted to indicate that traps were a thing, but have the trap fail from lack of maintenance so they were not punished for ignorance.  So I moved the trap. No problem!  They got it right away, and it served its purpose.\n&gt; The room they enter is sparsely furnished, and unremarkable…except for an odd purple stain on the floor.  Closer examination reveals a gelatinous purple Ooze in front of the exit. The Barbarian is directed to use his club to smash the floor and draw it away with vibrations while the party sneaks past.  An excellent plan…until the ooze detects them and grabs the ankles of the Summoner and Cleric, burning their flesh. Scimitars and staves seem to have n9o effect, but the club of the barbarian makes short work of the wobbling mass, and our party continues further into the depths.\n\nThe Goblins and Dwarves were 'soft' fights, to get them pumped about combat.  I wanted the ooze to be a bit more challenging.  Monster balance was one of my big worries, but I seem to have hit it right – it felt challenging, damage was done in both directions, and they had a satisfying (gross) kill at the end.  Just the right level of peril, in my opinion. The rolls allowed me to add lots of flavour text, with the staff bouncing off like a slap on Jell-o, and slices of a scimitar healing themselves. The Ogre simply beat the jelly to death, quietly swinging his club every turn until it was paste. My veteran told me he was happy that the ooze was more interesting than the first two fights (which he conceded as necessary, given the groups collective lack of experience).\n&gt; Traversing several corridors brings our party to a small room lined with shelves.  Smashed glass covers every available surface, but a careful search uncovers a handful of intact vials with various tinctures inside. After equipping their new finds, the party pauses for breath.  What shall they find next?\n\nI had thrown together a random potion table, and rolled a d12 to see how many potions they were able to find with two successful search checks – 12, of course.  They ended up with 5 healing potions, 2 Blindness potions, 2 bottles of ipecac, 2 potions of Protection From Evil, and one potion of Enlargement (unanimously entrusted to the Ogre). \n\nThis is where we hit the 4 hour mark, and had to call it a night.  The disappointment we all felt at stopping there was my final badge of honour. \n\nNext session on Wednesday!\n\nEDIT\n\n[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/23620u/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/) &amp; [Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2362g6/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/)",

        "text": "The following are the session notes for my very first session as a GM. \n----\nI wrote this adventure with generated characters in mind, as three of my four players were brand new players – their first RP experience! The Cleric I assigned to the veteran, as his backstory is complicated and I knew he could roll with it easily. The most trepidations of my new players I assigned the Barbarian… after all, who doesn't love smashing things with a club? As my story opens with the Barbarian, it also gave me an opportunity to gift-wrap some description for him, and give him a feel for what to expect… and it worked beautifully.\nI decided that I would crib the mechanic I would use to get the party together from *The Usual Suspects* – a group of specialists brought together under false pretences to do a job for a mysterious criminal mastermind…\n&gt; An ogre (our Barbarian) approaches an abandoned warehouse, thinking he is going to find work as a bodyguard.  Instead he encounters three strangers (a human Cleric, a drow Summoner and an elven Assassin) all of whom also believe they are present for some other reason.  Before they can leave, another figure enters.  He is thin and regal-looking, wearing simply designed clothes of exceptional quality. He passes notes to each of them and waits.  The notes reveal a secret of each individual, and promise coercion. There is a rune at the bottom of the note which the reader is told will reveal the truth of its message.  When touched, all participants feel intense pain along their left arms simultaneously. They also understand the truth of the blackmail within.  The note-passer introduces himself as Graeling, the emissary of Vorner Rahe - a shadowy, near-mythical underworld figure and leader of The Burning Scroll. The Cleric attacks Graeling only to find his mace passes through his incorporeal form.  He then checks his left arm, and sees a large tattoo of a burning scroll along it. Graeling explains that these fellows are now the property of the Burning Scroll, and should they follow orders willingly things might be easier for them.  He explains that rumours have cropped up about the existence of a map to the hidden location of Ligo the Horrendous, an archmage who died during the Great Kobold Uprising 500 years ago. Rahe wants Ligo's treasure. The party is ordered to bring it back to the meeting place, and upon delivery they shall be rewarded.\n\nMy players took to these characters VERY quickly, which made me very happy. Immediately, the assassin developed a dislike of the Summoner, and the Cleric attached himself to the Ogre (played by someone new to the game, and decided on a 'speaks softly and carries an enormous club' personality that was RP'd perfectly). Elements of the backstory that I provided and that the players embellished began to trickle out, and it was glorious.\n&gt; The party travels to the nearby town of Eden's Burrow, the source of the rumours regarding the map. On the way, they are ambushed by a troupe of Goblin highwaym... muggers. A quick battle ensues.\n\nThis was about as perfect a first fight as I could have hoped for.  Everyone got some great shots in, the Ogre smeared Goblins to paste left and right (actually batting the head right off one of them), and the Goblins were Wile E. Coyote-level comical. The Summoner could NOT get a spell off, and it was more fun than frustrating. It got everyone in the mood for more, and set a great, casual tone for combat.\n&gt; The goblins have amongst their takings a set of documents and a note pointing to an Inn and a reference to 'Wine' and a meeting about the map.  \n\nI dropped this in because I saw this portion fo the story taking a VERY long time, and frankly I wanted to get them to the next story beat.  Hooray, railroading!  Nobody minded.\n&gt; In town, the travellers (who are already thinking of themselves as a team, if an unlikely one) approach the Dwarven Liver Inn. The Ogre waits outside given his race's (and his personal) mutual animosity towards Dwarves. The party has their weapons confiscated by an indifferent warder, the assassin almost reflexively smuggling his poison dagger into the bar. After a conversation with the friendly Dwarven pub landlord (and several orders of locally sourced bramble wine), they are directed to some tables at the back where some business is being transacted. Here they meet a fellow named Wine who is running a dice game. He engages the cleric in a game of Cutpurse, winning 10gp from the party.  Mention of the map is made, and purchase is negotiated.  The party makes its way to the exit.\n\nI had set this up with numerous possible outcomes - gambling for the map itself, direct intimidation, tense negotiation, etc. - and it went more smoothly than I imagined. The party accepted nearly the asking price for the map, and I only realised afterwards I offered it at my negotiating floor instead of my staring price... oops.  No harm, no foul I guess. They enjoyed the dice game, rolling actual dice.  Result!\n\nMore to come...\n\nEDIT\n\n[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/226hwt/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/) &amp; [Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/23620u/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/) &amp; [Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2362g6/ml20_the_burning_scroll_or_the_unusual_suspects/)",

For those of you who don't know what civcraft is it is a minecraft server focused around making civilizations like the game civilization. So I got the server Ip and joined the server. I spawned in the middle of a blank field with no trees. i started to head west for a couple of in game days. I then found a small floating city in the sky. To get to said sky city there was a mountain with a bridge connecting to it. So I climbed the mountain and when i got to the top a skeleton shot me off the mountain and I died. I hope you guys liked this i will try to post my story on a daily basis here. \n\npart two: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2272ct/my_civcraft_story_part_2/ \n\nPart three: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/228u6w/minecraftmy_civcraft_story_part_3/\n\nPart four: http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/22doqy/minecraft_my_civcraft_story_part_4/",

        "text": "What follows is a made up story following a group of players through a Star Wars Saga type adventure through an Old Republic setting. But first, the characters\n\n**Mark, the GM.** Mark is a pretty good GM. He tries not to railroad the team too much, but when they get too far off base, he tries to give them a nudge in the right direction. Easy going and will put up with a lot of crap the team does. But he is also fair. If you do something stupid, he will make the world react to it.\n\n**Jim, the Human Jedi.** Not your typical Jedi. He plays more like a sith. Long time player, he is the leader of the group, he is regularly the one coming up with the plans. Not too easy to anger, but he will act on his emotions if you push him. He also is always trying to find new uses for his abilities. True Neutral in nature, he will do just about anything as long as it brings him glory.\n\n**Dave, the Rodian Bounty Hunter. (AKA: That Guy)** New to the game, he chose the bounty hunter. One of his favorite characters from the movies was always Boba Fett. Never played a tabletop game before, he is the source of many of the screwups of the game, though this is more due to his lousy luck with the dice. Though he rarely breaks character. Chaotic Neutral in name, but not in practice\n\n**Arty, the Jawa Mechanic.** The smart but quiet one of the group. He plays as the resident pilot/mechanic of the group. He deals mostly with the machines the team runs into along the journey. Calm and level headed. He is generally the one who comes in to save the day when shit hits the fan. True Neutral as well, he will be willing to do a job as long as it pays well.\n\nFor the remainder of the story, and all following stories, anything that is in parentheses should be considered out of character.\n\n---\n\n(Mark(GM): Ok Welcome to the game guys. Let me see your character sheets....)\n\n(Everyone passes their character sheets over)\n\n(GM: Lets see, a Droid, a Bounty Hunter, and a Noble. Ok, Not bad. Lets see how it goes. I need you all to figure out why you are heading to Coruscant. You will all be on a small shuttle heading there.)\n\n(Jim(J): Ok, I am heading there for a council meeting being the diplomat for Naboo.)\n\n(Dave(D): I am heading there for work. Looking to find a bounty.)\n\n(Arty(A): I am the local R2 unit on board the ship. I am responsible for maintenance.)\n\n(GM: Ok, now for the background. *in a theatrical voice* A long time ago in a galaxy far far away...)\n\n(D: Really?)\n\n(GM: Yes, really, if you have a problem with me trying to bring a little enthusiasm into the story too bad. Now...where was I? Oh right *In theatrical voice* It has been a time of peace in the galaxy. Many planets are enjoying a time of prosperity. The people growing lax in this time of peace. However, in some of the darker corners of the galaxy there are rumors of a new threat. A rebel faction has risen up to try to overthrow the Republic.Jim, your noble has been called to Coruscant for an emergency meeting on how to deal the rebel group. Also on your shuttle you see a pilot droid, an astromech droid, a bounty hunter, and a robed man. You cannot see this mans face. What do you do?)\n\n(J: What kind of ship are we on.)\n\n(GM: You are on a small transport shuttle. It has basic shields, but will not be able to withstand an explosive blast from a larger ship. You chose this ship for its cover to avoid assassins.)\n\nD:(I head over to the robed man.) Sup, why you heading to Coruscant?\n\nRobed Man(RM): Go away, I don't feel like talking to you.\n\nD: Well that was rude. Just trying to make time pass. \n\nRM: Make it pass your own way. You are wasting my time you fool.\n\nD: Fool? (I punch the man)\n\n(GM: Really Dave? Already? Alright. Roll to hit.)\n\n(D: *roll* “5” ....Uhh...can I get a redo?)\n\n(GM: Not on your life. You miss as the man senses the punch coming. He tumbles past you to the middle of the shuttle. He draws and ignites his lightsaber. The blood red blade extends from the base. During his tumble, his hood is thrown from his head, his eyes are a sickly glowing yellow. Before you stands a sith.)\n\n(D: Aww crap...Wait...a sith must be worth a boatload of credits. I engage him.)\n\n(GM: Roll initiative.)\n\n(D *roll* allright 19.)\n\n(GM: Ok, you get to go first)\n\n(D: Alright, lets see what do I have to attack with...*Dave spends a few seconds looking over his character sheet* Oh...Nice, I attack him with my wrist mounted rocket.)\n\n*All stop what they are doing and look at Dave like he is an idiot.*\n\n(GM: Really?)\n\n(D: Yeah, I want to shoot him with a weapon that can hurt him and he can't send back at me.)\n\n(J: Can I shoot Dave?)\n\n(GM: You don't have your weapon out and you aren’t in sight of him. You would have to use your move action to draw it. You won't be able to draw it and move in range to hit him in time. Arty, What are you doing?)\n\n(A: drawing up a new character sheet.)\n\n(J: Yeah...thats a good idea.)\n\n(D: You guys are acting like we already lost. Come on guys, have a little faith. I roll to hit *roll* “9”)\n\n(GM: Well...Game over, hand in your character sheets.)\n\n(D: What? Why? He didn't hit me. How are we already dead?)\n\n(DM: Dave...you fired a rocket in a small shuttle with no armor. You missed and your rocket kept going and hit the wall behind the sith. Blasting a hole in it. What happens when you blast a hole in a space ship?)\n\n(D: ...Oh...Right.)\n\n(J: Yeah. Right. Well...I think next time I will be a jedi. what about you Arty?)\n\n(A: I’m thinking Jawa mechanic and pilot)\n\n---\n\nAnd thus ends the first adventure of the team.

        "text": "Story based off the Star Wars Sage rules. This is all made up for your enjoyment.\n\nLittle background first. Team consisted of a NN Human Jedi, the group leader, leaning towards CN and the dark side and has a certain dark side force ability that will come into play. A CN Rodian Bounty Hunter, and a NN Jawa Mechanic/Pilot. Group had to take out a gang on Coruscant that was causing trouble for the locals.  It took some coercing to take the job. Was able to force a few extra credits out of the slums leader who wanted the gang gone.\n\nSo, group heads down to the slums where the gang hideout is and makes up a plan of attack.  The hideout is a large bar that is only open to the members of the gang. After some scouting, the group finds a back entrance to the bar. Only one guard making sure no one gets in. \n\n---\n\nBounty Hunter(BH): Ok, whats the plan?\n\nJedi(J): I have an idea. I dont know if it will work, but if it fails we can just kill the guy. Be ready to move if it fails.\n\nBH: Ok...but what are you going to do?\n\nJ: Kill the guy without him ever seeing us. (GM Can I use the force to push a vein in his head to cause a stroke)\n\n(GM: I guess you can, but it will be a pretty high DC roll you will need)\n\n(J: Ok. *rolls* \"19\" Will that do?)\n\n(GM: Uh...yeah, just barely, the guard drops dead leaving the entrance free to go into)\n\nJ: Huh...I cant believe that worked... Ok. Lets move up.\n\nBH: Well that was easy. (I move up and check his body for loot)\n\n(GM: On his body you find a datapad. You also find a credit stick worth 50 credits. He had a small gun on him, but it is cheap. On closer inspection, you can tell it is only worth about 40 credits.)\n\nBH: Hey, Mechanic, heres a datapad, see what you can find out of it. (I take the blaster to sell later and the credit stick)\n\n(Mechanic(M): I check the datapad for any information)\n\n(GM: On the datapad, you find a crude map of the bar. If you roll a mechanics check you can try and see if there is more information on there.)\n\n(M: *Rolls* \"14\".)\n\n(GM: Searching the datapads inner files, you see you have access to the guards bank account. In his account there is *roll* 300 credits that can be moved into your account. You also find you can hack into the bars basic control systems. There is nothing else of interest on the datapad)\n\n(M: I move the money over.) Guys, there's a map of the bar on here, it pretty big, but theres the office, the kitchen, and the large main seating area of the bar. This door here leads into the kitchen.\n\nJ: Can you tell if there is a sprinkler system? I have another idea.\n\n(GM: There is an adequate sprinkler system set up in the kitchen and bar area, but not in the office.)\n\nJ: Ok. M check the door and see if we can sneak into the kitchen from here without being noticed.\n\n(M: *Roll* \"9\")\n\n(GM: You open the door silently and can see that the kitchen staff consists of just the one chef. There are a few service droids moving around, but they have no weapons on them.)\n\nJ: BH, go in there and take him out as silently as you can.\n\n(BH: I draw my vibroknife from its holster and sneak up on the chef. *roll* \"13\")\n\n(GM: You are able to sneak up on the chef and are standing right behind him now. As long as you dont roll a 1 you will be able to hit him.)\n\n(BH: *Roll* \"2\". Shit...that was close)\n\n(GM: You successfully manage to grab a hold of the chef and slit his throat, however, on his way down, he hits several pots and pans knocking them to the floor with a loud clang. *roll* luckily, due to the loud nature of the kitchen, no one comes to investigate the sound.)\n\nBH: (I make my way back to the door) What now?\n\nJ: Go around to the front and bar the entrance. Make sure no one can get out. \n\nBH: I can do that.\n\nJ: M, once he does that I need you to trip the fire alarm and turn the sprinklers on.\n\nM: Ok. Then what.\n\nJ: (Smiling) Then the fun begins.\n\n*In the interest of time and space, BH is able to successfully bar the doors. No one can get in or out.*\n\nBH: Alright, all set up on this end. \n\nM: Roger, setting off fire alarm now.\n\n(GM: The fire alarm goes off and the sprinkler system activates. The 10 gang members in the bar rush for the exit, but no one can get through the doors.)\n\nJ: Ok, now that everyone is wet, shut off the sprinklers.\n\nM: Shutting them off.\n\n(J: I step into the main area of the bar. I turn towards the group of gang members and shoot a force lightning into the group. *roll* \"16\")\n\n(GM: *makes several rolls* Due to the fact that everyone is wet, they are all hit by the effects of the lightning. Roll damage and add +3 to the damage due to being wet)\n\n(J: *Roll 2d6* \"12\" Oh nice. plus 3 thats 15 damage.)\n\n(GM: All of the gang members are overcome by the strength of the lightning and they all fall to the ground dead.\n\nJ: Well that was easy. BH, you can open the doors and come in now. We are all good.\n\n---\n\nAfter this, the gang searches for loot, but most of it is fried thanks to the lightning. They are able to get about 100 credits of working cred sticks out of the group though and a few items they can sell for cash later. They return to the leader of the Slums and they get their credits for the job. All in a days work.\n\n\nIf you like this and would like to see more, leave a comment and I will continue the adventures of the team.\n",

        "text": "After finding this sub I've decided to post one of my favorite role-playing stories.\n\nIt was a game of Star Wars: Saga Edition, and the party consisted of two soldiers, Sarge and Corliss, a soldier/pilot, Mack, a soldier/engineer, Alphonso, and two Jedi whose names I can't remember because no one cared.  \nThe campaign was set in the Old Republic and the four soldiers were attached to a Jedi diplomat and her Padawan. The encounter begins with the party coming out of hyperspace right in front of a Sith battleship. Our ship a Republic cruiser gets pummeled by turbo lasers and eventually caught in a tractor beam. \n\nFeeling that we should take the fight ti the Sith as soon as we hit the flight deck, Sarge and Alphonso devise a plan. Our cruiser has a small continent of low level marines and a cargo bay full of speeder bikes we picked up from a Sith outpost. The plan is to put on spacesuits and when the ship is a few meters from the entering the Sith ship we drop the cargo bay doors and lead a Calvary charge onto the enemy ship. \n\nSeconds creep by as the tractor beam pulls our ship closer and closer to awaiting doom and glorious death. At last the moment arrives and Mack jerks the ship lining up the cargo bay with the Sith flight deck, the doors drop and 33 Republic marines coming buzzing out pf this cruiser like bees attacking a hungry bear. The important part of this story is the modifications that Mack and Alphonse had made to these speeder bikes, the modification being Dixie horns. \n\nThe Sith troopers are caught with their trousers down and we clear the flight deck within a couple of rounds. Our next move is to fight our way to the bridge, the ships corridors and our low level marines to bottle neck our enemies and lay down suppressive fire. After what seems like hours we slog our way to the bridge, kill or incapacitate any resistance, and seal the doors. \n\nSo now here we are trapped on the bridge our numbers half of what they were when we started and no real way to fight off the rest of the ships garrison of Sith troopers. Thats when Alphonso has a stroke of genius, he sits down at a control panel and starts rolling dice going over all the ships life support systems, a few decent rolls later from him and Mack and the ships life support systems have been shut down and the atmosphere vented. The ships defenders are defeated and we've taken a capital ship with a cruiser and thirty marines, ruining the GMs escape storyline and netting the group a Sith battleship as loot. \n\nFrom that day forward the 13th Republic Marine Recons motto was simply \"speeder bikes.\"",

        "text": "(note, any stats listed are without modifiers)\n\nSo quick background, i'm the current DM for a large DnD group, and they'd been grinding through a Dr.who based homebrew campaign for the past three weeks now. (we play on a monday night)\n\nMost of them are evil.\n\nWalking into the next room, they all come across a huge metal door, complete with closed eye's, a closed mouth, and written above it is \"the password is buffalo.\"\n\nOur sorcerer walks up and, without thinking, proceeds to shout \"Buffalo\" at the door. Slowly, the door opens it's eye's and angrily screams, \"WHY DOES EVERYBODY ALWAYS SAY THAT! WOULD A HELLO SUFFICE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE!\"\n\nSpending the next five or so minutes trying to calm the door down, the human mage walks up and starts casually talking to it, asking it how long it's been down here. It responds quite happily with, \"Oh gee...um...gosh....It's been a very long time, since my master created me a long time ago to protect something, but i don't know what, but i have to protect it, and not many people come down here though so it's nice talking to people and...\"\n\nThe mage cut in and asked, \"So what's behind you?\" To which the door replied, \"a room.\"\n\n\"May we enter?\"\n\"Nope.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Because my master said not to let people pass.\"\n\nOur barbarian (with a failed diplomacy check) asks, \"So can you just say the password?\" But instead, comes out something more like, \"Password say please?\"\n\nThe door, still smiling, just stares the barbarian and says, \"I'm sorry, but what are you trying to say?\"\n\nAfter a re-roll, 18, he asks the question once more.\n\n\"Oh no, i can't possibly say it, my master told me I couldn't, or people would get past.\"\n\nAt this point, they could see that they weren't getting very far, so our doppelganger, who was a bird at the time, decided to transform into a human to see if she could do anything. At this, the door stated, \"Oh my god, that was amazing! can you do magic tricks!?!\"\n\nBefore anyone could respond, our sorcerer, with a bluff check of 19, proceeds to convince the door that it was him that transformed the bird into a person. The door then asks for more.\n\nSo with another bluff check of 19, he \"turns\" the doppelganger into a buffalo. The door, who is ecstatic at this point, starts yelling \"Oh my god that's so amazing you've turned it into a cow or an ox or something, that's so cool!\"\n\n\"No, not quite an ox, or a cow, but something close....\"\n\"No it's definitely a cow, but that sort of magic reminds me of my master, he did cool things like that.\"\n\nThe sorcerer, using more bluff, then tries to convince the door that he is in fact the doors master.\n\n6\n\n\"Pfft, don't be silly, my master would be reaaaallllly old by now, and he had a beard, and did cooler things. You're not him.\"\n\nAsking again if he could roll another bluff, I told him one more time before the door started ignoring him altogether.\n\nNatural, 20.\n\n\"OMG master it is you! How have you been!? I'm so sorry i didn't recognize you! You look younger now and you've shaved your beard. Well i did what you asked, no one got through, and I've been here all this time making sure, it's totally safe.\"\n\nThe sorcerer walked forward and in his mightiest voice, said, \"Thank you door for your service throughout all these years, and now, i release you from your verbal bounds.\"\n\n\"You mean I can say it? I can finally say my favorite word? Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, here goes everyone i can say it, i can finally say it, here goes...............................................Buffalo.\"\n\nAnd with a groaning creak and a scream of pure agony, the door splits open down the middle and opens up to the next room, it's eyes closing and it's voice silenced.\n\nNot a word was spoken.\n\nEveryone was now staring at each other in silence, wondering what just happened.\n\nThe barabarian looked at me, and in a tiny voice, asked, \"Can we make a heal check on the door?\" I just shook my head. \"No.\" The dragon born asked, \"can we still talk to it?\" Again, i answered. \"No.\" \n\nFor once, all the players who played evil characters felt a shred of remorse for the innocent door they just killed, and on that day, I saw them want to bring back something they themselves had murdered.\n\nAs they silently walked through the archway, I could swear they were internally crying.\n\nThey had killed a door.  \n\n  ",

        "text": "In my first session ever, I played the role of DM. My players were, for the most part, rather crazy, even by my current standards. \n\nThe Cast:\n\n* **Frank, the Obligatory Thief**\n\nSo, Frank was played by a really good friend of mine who always plays the chaotic evil character. He was also the only person in the group who had ever played DnD before. He always loved and still loves to throw wrenches into carefully-laid plans.\n\n* **Morokei the Wrangler, Minotaur**\n\nMorokei was played by a good friend of mine, and is the only character that has been frequently resurrected for different campaigns. His typical Barbarian INT was 1, and we decided that he could not speak common for giggles.\n\n* **Bubba Hexblade, the Quiet One**\n\nThis character was based off of the class Hexblade from Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms, but my friend didn't realize that Hexblade wasn't his last name. We just rolled with it, though. Sadly, he didn't do much in the adventure.\n\n* **Elgeon Bear-Tamer, the Bear Tamer**\n\nThis was my personal favorite. Elgeon was a druid with a spectral bear companion, again based off whatever variation is in Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms. As new players, however, we didn't really get that the bear was a spirit, and assumed that Elgeon could seriously just summon bears whenever the fuck he wanted one, which, coincidentally, meant all the damn time.\n\n\nAnd so, in typical DnD fashion, the story begins in a tavern. I sat behind my makeshift screen with my first d20 and some notes, covering the paper dungeon map with a blanket. Everyone was ready to play. I cleared my throat, pulled the first paper from my stack, and began to read.\n\n\"You are in a tavern. It is a rowdy evening, and-\"\n\n\"Are there women??\" asks Frank, quite eager to piss me off as quickly as was possible.\n\n\"No. The kingdom is prejudiced to women.\" I say, thinking that perhaps I'd outsmarted him.\n\n\"Well, then I want ale.\"\n\n\"You already have a frothing mug of-\" \n\n\"I drink it! MORE ALE! MORE ALE!\" he chants, rapidly drawing in all the other players at the table in what appeared to be some sort of blood ritual as they pounded the table rhythmically and in time. I groan. *So, this was how the evening was to go,* I thought. I couldn't have been more correct.\n\nAfter about three minutes, I seriously got up, made them all mugs off cream soda and a big plate of nachos, and then came back, throwing them on the snack table haphazardly.\n\n\"NOW! You have your damned ale, so let's get back on track.\"\n\nContent, Frank allowed his ugly head to lie back down, at least for the moment. The other players followed the leader, and calmed down as well.\n\n\"*Ahem*...as I was saying, it is a rowdy evening and the tavern is full of men enjoying their evenings. Elgeon (as he had the highest passive perception score), you notice a man in black armor and a woman in her fifties looking at you over their shoulders. What do you do?\"\n\nElgeon contemplates this for a moment, before realizing that he has a bear with him.\n\n\"I send my bear to investigate.\"\n\n\"What?\" I ask with confusion, \"Your bear may be smarter than Morokei (who at this point interrupts to describe the piece of mucus he has just pulled from his nose), but that doesn't mean he can talk.\"\n\nFrank chimes in with a defense of the bear, claiming that it should be able to telepathically communicate with Elgeon. The group begins a spirited debate over telepathic connections between bears and players which lasts a good twenty minutes. I put my head into my hands, wondering what unholy thing my suggestion that we should play DnD could have given birth to. \n\nAnd that is how Elgeon learned to telecommunicate with his bear, and thus, the rise of Bearlock Holmes the First began.\n\n**To Be Continued**\n\n",

        "text": "This is the story of how an otherwise underpowered character almost singlehandedly saved his party with quick thinking, good reflexes, and impeccable roleplaying.\n\n[This happened some time ago but I'm leaving it in present tense as most of it is copypasta from the session report I typed out immediately after the game. For those readers unfamiliar with DnD, I'll try to explain game-specific terms in brackets like these.]\n\nI sm DMing for a party of five 2nd-level characters in a game of DnD 3.5.  This is the first tabletop RPG that most of the players have participated in, so we have been moving slowly while they learn the game mechanics and suss out what exactly they are dealing with. I'm a fair DM and I base most of my decisions on what would be \"fun\" for the players, but I let them call their own shots and they are fully responsible for the consequences of their actions. There has already been one death in the party, so they aren't unaware of the very real dangers that their characters face.\n\nThere's one character in particular that I need to flesh out for you before getting to the meat of the story. He's a halfing [think hobbit] monk with severe ADHD. The player has been roleplaying the character exceptionally well; he actually makes regular rolls to check what his attention-deficient response to any given situation is, often with near-disastrous results for the party (a mechanic that constantly keeps me on my toes, as I never know what will happen next). \n\nWe've been making our way through one large underground complex for quite a while, largely because I'm placing them in big battles with large groups of weak/not too clever enemies to help them get used to the combat mechanics without facing too much danger. Things have also been slowed by significant periods of serious roleplay/diplomacy as well (not that that's a negative at all - they've gotten as much experience from that as from fighting). \n\nSo anyway, it seemed the time had finally come for something a bit more challenging, so I set that up for them tonight. Last week they had fought two big battles and were seriously depleted on HP and spells, so I had strongly encouraged them to head back to town and rest up in safety before continuing. They decided to go ahead and delve deeper into the dungeon despite my heavy hint, however. Knowing what was coming, I began to fear for all their lives.\n\nWe left off last time in a large room with a spiral staircase leading down a hole in the center of the floor. They climbed down and found themselves in the middle of an enormous room: 40-ft high ceilings with luminescent fungi everywhere and a deep layer of rotting compost on the floor. There they met with twig blights [walking pokey sapling-thingies], and four skeletons skulking around and tending to the accumulated compost. For the sake of space, I'll just say that they dispatched the baddies (except for 2 turned [frightened] skellies that disappeared through a door on the south wall) but took still more wounds in the process. The dwarven rogue immediately went to check the passageway the skeletons had escaped to while the rest of the party stayed near the bottom of the stairs. Most everybody was down to 1/4 health or less by this point and they were very much in need of a break. \n\nNow there was a large cave mouth in the north wall which led to the residence of an absolute beast of a bugbear (heavily armored lvl 4 fighter/barbarian with excellent melee feats wielding a two-handed morningstar). The original idea was that he and his two well-trained (and HD-advanced [extra-tough]) dire rats would come investigate the sounds of battle during the third round of combat in the main room. I rolled up on my decision tree that he happened to be asleep when the battle started, however (phew), and it took him some time to don his armor. The initial battle was over by the time he was ready to fight. I had the party make listen checks to hear him getting prepared, so they were aware something was up and were ready for trouble. \n\nNow they're standing in the middle of the room watching the cave mouth when this horrendous seven-foot tall creature decked in full battle regalia (stag horns for a hat, anybody?) comes barreling straight towards them at full speed, yelling and cursing in goblin, telling them to, \"Get ready for the stewpot!\" I mean to this weakened party, dude was SERIOUSLY scary. They've hardly encountered anything bigger than a goblin before. I'm talking total party kill in maximum 6-7 rounds [~20 seconds] of toe-to-toe combat. \n\nThe players debated their choice for a or a bit (I always let them discuss strategy and tactics out of character, even in the middle of combat, because how else does anyone learn that stuff?); in an attempt to save their collective asses I let them make wisdom checks so I could not-so-subtly inform them that discretion might be the better part of valor in this particular situation. The barbarian player went completely against her character's personality by deciding to listen to my advice and high-tail it out of there; most everyone else followed in a mass exodus up the stairway. \n\nThe little monk, however, faithfully rolled and failed his ADD check and thereby determined that the best course of action would be to rush full-speed towards the threat. He later told me he seriously feared for his life at that point, but had to play inside the bounds of his character's weakness (if only all players would operate that way... sigh). He fortunately realized his mistake before actually reaching the baddies and turned to run back toward the stairs-. The rats caught up with him, but both missed their trip attacks and he slipped away cleanly. He started up the stairs and had the presence of mind to lay some caltrops (which he had cleverly decided to pick up earlier in the dungeon) behind him to slow any pursuit. \n\nBoth rats and the big guy missed their intelligence checks to not go barreling up a narrow stairway in pursuit of a large party; they also missed their spot checks for the caltrops, and all three wound up wounded as a result [slowing them to half speed, for those of you not familiar with the item - just think a bunch if thumbtacks scattered on the ground]. This gave the monk the chance to pull out his sling and start taking pot shots as he retreated up the staircase (faster than the enemy could travel, given the whole \"metal spike in foot\" situation). He knocks one rat off the staircase to its death, and the other two finally make their percentile roll to give up the chase and head muttering and grumbling back towards the cave, glad to have chased the intruders away. (The monk can't see them at this point since he's retreated high enough that the stairs below him effectively block his view.) \n\nThe rest of the party, meanwhile, are busily retreating and yelling for the monk to come with, abandoning the rogue (remember him?) to his fate. \n\nNow all this time said rogue had been silently slipping down the eastern wall to get in position for- BAM! ranged sneak attack right as the big baddie is dealing with the caltrops wedged between his toes. Significant damage from a bolt in the back. Mr. Big is too angry and hurt to find the source of this new irritation, however. \n\nThe monk can soon see the enemy heading back towards the cave, limping and grumbling about the \"stupid spikies\" that had dared to get in the way. The rest of the party is getting worried that no one has made it up the stairs yet, so they head back down to check on the situation. Metal armor + move silently down a staircase = not such a terrific idea. The bugbear, who's most of the way to his cave by now, of course notices the commotion and comes rushing back with a renewed rage. \"How dare they continue to harass me after I've chased them away,\" he thinks. He charges up the staircase at double speed [meaning he's Charging and can easily knock people ahead of him straight down to their deaths] - I had judged that a spiral stair could approximate a straight line since he used his hand to anchor himself to the central pole, using it as an axis of rotation (yes, I know it's not strictly legit, but it sounded cool and the DM has discretion, right?) The monk had fortunately moved to the outside of the staircase the previous round to take a shot at the rat still on the ground, so the bugbear just whizzed right past him on the way up. Attack of opportunity missed, but the monk is now standing behind his foe. At this point I have no idea how this whole thing will turn out. Biggie still has most his health, monk and rogue are trapped below him, and the rest of the party is totally unsure of whether to run or fight... \n\nThen the monk comes up with an absolutely batshit crazy idea - he's going to try running up a spiral staircase with no rails and jump up on this giant bugbear's back. Remember now, this creature is fully thrice his size and has disrupted balance due to his injured feet - not the most clever idea, but perfectly in character for this little dude. Mr. Halfling makes his balance check to run up, makes his tumble check to fling himself on the beastie's back (there are rings welded onto the armor that almost act as a ladder for him), and prepares to, well, I'm not sure exactly what he was going to try next. Problem is, his new mount fails its own balance check and begins to fall back down the stairs itself. Our super-duper halfling monk leaps off (with a grossly successful tumble check), but then lands too close to the edge of the stairs and teeters precariously over it. Nope. Balance check failed. He immediately tries to catch himself- reflex save made, but then the strength check to hang on just isn't quite good enough. Nearly thirty feet to the bottom, and only ten HP to spare. I give him a little credit for slowing his fall by grabbing out for the ledge, and he gets a further reduction to damage from the soft ground below. The dice fall in his favor and he pulls a total parkour move, smoothly rolling as he hits bottom- 3d6 falling damage, minus modifiers, and boom-only 3 total points of damage after falling most of the way from the ceiling. Now that's what I call a class act {for those who *are*familiar with the game, nobody remembered his tumble check for saving against the fall.} \n\nThe bugbear, meanwhile, fails multiple checks to slow its fall and crashes all the way to the bottom of the stair (and right through all the caltrops, I might mention). It lands prone on the ground, injured from the fall, and as it shakily rises to its knees our sneaky rogue, who's been withholding his action the whole time, pops up with his readied sneak attack. His javelin flies true and plants itself firmly in the monster's ear. The horrid creature slowly collapses into the dirt, its lifeblood quietly oozing out of its cracked skull. The other rat (who somehow failed multiple spot and intelligence checks to deal with the party or at least run away) was easily dispatched with a couple of crisp ranged attacks as it wandered back to the cave. \n\nVictory accomplished. Cue halfling success kid.",

        "text": "This is a story of the first encounter of the Warforged (played by yours truly) and his ragtag team of companions (all of us are level 5).  Really, our Druid did most of the leg work while the rest of us tried to help out.\n\nThe Cast:\n\n-  Rogue (Skill-Monkey McBackstabbers)\t\n-  Warforged Dungeoncrasher Fighter (22 AC and Improved Trip, a meat shield)\n-  Bard (Cob the Goblin, aka, the Cob-Goblin, our shady businessman)\n-  Wu Jen (the water Halfling)\n-  Druid (Vow of Poverty, bear companion)\n\n\nThe Baddies:\n\n-  Lots of Kobolds (all the baddies go after my turn)\n-  Kobold Summoner\n-  Kobold Badass Spear-Chucking Body Guard\n-  Summoned Hell-Hounds\n-  Dire Weasels\n\nThe Setting:\t\n\nA small refuge camp for gnomes.  Lots of injured housed in a few tents (one big tent in the middle) with a road heading west, northeast, and southeast.  There are some trees to the southwest about 60 feet from the majority of us standing at the main tent.  At this point, the Wu Jen and the Druid have not yet joined the party.\n\nThe Fight:\n\nA spear lands next to the Bard, the Rogue spends his turn telling everyone to take cover as he does likewise.  I ready my shield and start charging the trees where presumably the spear came from.  Halfway there, I see some Kobolds and start making a beeline for them.  Everyone else starts to move into position/join the initiative because they were not initially aware of what was happening.\n\nThe Summoner summons a Hell-Hound on me, so I start dealing with it and eat a breath attack in the process.  The Druid starts spamming Summon Nature's Ally # like there is no tomorrow.  The Bard sings, the Rogue comes over and gets a sneak attack due to my flank on the Hell-Hound.  Another Hell-Hound is summoned on me, and I eat another breath attack and a melee attack.\n\nThe Rogue dispatches the one hound, and I, being sick of having all these arrows and spears bounce off of me, decide to move over to one of the Kobolds (taking an AoO from the Hell-Hound as if I cared) and proceed to Bull-Rush/Dungeoncrash him into (and through) a tree.  He doesn't die somehow, but someone else finishes him off in a jiffy.\n\nAt this point the Druid (brand new to DnD) is having a fun time having his pets miss like crazy in between spurts of them destroying things with flanks.  He is taking up half of all our turn taking time.  The Wu Jen is throwing needles and spells that seem to be taking people out.  The Rogue kills one more thing before missing for the rest of eternity.  The Bard has been taking pop shots while I eat a critical hit from the Body Guard.\n\nThings are looking bad for me now,  I have less than 20 health, so I move behind a tree to heal up with my trusty Healing Belts (at ½ healing effectiveness because I am Warforged).  I eat another 2 breath attacks from the remaining Hell-Hound and a brand new one (somehow the tree provided 0 cover for me.)  I spend a turn getting a new Healing Belt out of a bag of holding and another turn equipping it and healing some more.  I am still pretty messed up, but I can still tank normal Kobolds all day unless they crit, so I stay there.  The Druid's bear exploded someone with a Crit, and most of the summoned wolves either die or expire after taking out many Kobolds.  The Druid himself crit a Kobold so hard that he killed its first born son.\n\nThe Summoner, seeing his forces diminished, casts a fog spell and starts to retreat.  I give chase with my small amount of hitpoints, but the Body Guard blocks my path somewhat.  As I get in range of the Summoner, the little Body Guard bull-rushes me backwards on a tied strength check.  The Summoner retreats, I give chase, only to see a solid line of Kobolds blocking my path to the Summoner.\n\nThe Rogue comes into melee of the Body Guard and gets dropped instantly.  While he bleeds out, I spend the next round chasing the 5-foot-stepping Body Guard towards his approaching backup, all the while I am rolling 1s three rounds in a row on my trip attempt's touch attack.\n\nThe Druid tries to call for peace, but none of the Kobolds speak common (besides the Summoner who is too far away).  Cob the Goblin asks for peace in Draconic, and the Body Guard tells the goon squad to stand down.  The Wu Jen had other ideas.  He moves in line with the goons, and in one breath spell kills all of them.\n\nAt this point, I am chomping at the bit to get my revenge on that Body Guard, but in the distance we hear the rumble of approaching mounts of some sort.  The Druid tells us to bail out, so he heals the Rogue (who I had ignored) enough to get him conscious.  Everyone bails out and meets up back at the main tent.\n\nWe see 6 Dire Weasels come out of the fog plus an additional one rode by the Summoner.  Our Druid uses a spell to talk to the Dire Weasels and convince them to run back the way they came, except for the one rode by the Summoner and another one that went after a wagon full of refugees escaping to the east.  Our Bard (also a brand new player) decided to shoot at the Kobold Summoner, but due to his poor aim, he hit the Dire Weasel instead.  The Summoner gets bucked off, and now we have an angry Dire Weasel after our Bard and one after the wagon of refugees.\n\nThe almost dead Rogue and Wu Jen book it down the road to the West.  I run after the wagon (going behind the biggest tent) and Cob follows after me in hopes that I can save him from the terrible 700 pound mistake of angry weasel he has made for himself.  I run around the tent, and now seeing only 1 Dire Weasel instead of 7, throw my flail at the weasel (the plan was originally to pull the tent down on all the weasels.)  The DM throws me a bone on my damage roll and I knocked it unconscious.  I chase after the wagon to push it up to max speed and leave Cob with the angry weasel who had come around the corner of the tent to find the little morsel of food that made him angry.\n\nPoor Cob gets grappled by the Dire Weasel, but the Druid sent his bear over to help (which was almost dead due to a crit it ate earlier), and it immediately joins the grapple.  I ignore them over the next 2 turn and get the wagon moving.  Cob failed to counter-grapple the Dire Weasel (only by about 20 some points) and he ends up unconscious.  Bro bear manages to knock the weasel out of the grapple but misses all of his attacks on the following round.  I charge back like a freight train and manage to trip the weasel.  It gets beat down by the bear's AoO (he beat me to it before I could roll) just before the other weasel wakes up.  I charge the weasel and hurt it a little before the bear comes over and crits it so hard he rips its head off and wears it as a hat.\n\nWith all the foes in sight dispatched and the refugees safely on their way, the Druid and I get Cob back on his feet and run to catch up to our friends.\n\nThe Outcome:\n\nThe Druid chased away 5 Dire Weasels, killed someone's first born son, and also killed about 4 or 5 more Kobolds between him and all of his many pets.  He also told the bear to take off his new Dire Weasel head hat because he doesn't want to risk it interfering with his Vow of Poverty.\n\nCob manage to not die, got a few hits in, gave us some buffs, and managed to prolong the combat by pissing off a Dire Weasel that might have walked away due to the Druid's negotiations.\n\nThe Wu Jen did a lot of damage to several Kobolds and totally ruined our chance at ending combat peacefully by annihilating a whole squad of the little buggers.\n\nThe Rogue got in a few good backstabs, a lot of misses, and a narrow escape from death due to his teammates.\n\nI ate a lot of hits and every single breath attack from the Hell-Hounds while managing to not land a killing blow on anything.  I may have killed a summoned creature, but they don't count for much.  I may have left a Healing Belt behind on the ground when I switched it out with another one, but since we ended the session about 100 feet away, I can just run back and get it.\n\nOverall, we were surprised and glad that everyone survived.  We had a fake bet going that Cob would die in his first encounter, and we were just a hair off from being right.  We got 0 loot for our efforts, but our Vow of Poverty Druid probably doesn't care too much about that.",

        "text": "So I, the DM, was hosting the finale session for my four man group when things kind of took a turn for the worse.\n\nFirst, some context. The party was a pretty standard setup, a Cleric, a Barbarian, a Rogue, and a Sorcerer. Now all my players were fairly experienced, they'd played in my last campaign which had lasted a few years, but we'd just switched to the slightly more deadly Pathfinder from 4e and our Sorcerer... well lets just say he wasn't the most cautious person.\n\nSo the group is exploring a ruined tower looking for magical artifacts when they reach the bottom of the basement. There, they're met by a not so friendly devil with a strange spiked iron crown on his head. Negotiations very quickly go south and combat is had. After a few rounds and a few close calls, the Barbarian manages to behead the creature and its body bursts into flame, leaving nothing but the crown behind.\n\nLet me describe this crown. Its ugly. Its iron. Its got spikes on the outside and the INSIDE. Did I mention the spikes on the inside?\nSo the Cleric nails his lore check to figure out what the hell this is and I tell him its an ancient artifact owned by a ancient tyrant king. Anyone who places the crown on another creatures head can then control that creature as if Dominate Person.\n \nSo, obviously bad news and the implication is someone put the crown on the devil to control it.\n\nAfter telling him this, I continue skimming the rules, just to make sure I know all I need to about this when the Sorcerer states very clearly \"I put it on\".\nI pause for a moment. I told him about the spikes right? I chuckle and then ask, \"Really?\" Kind of a red flag if you're a player when your DM asks that. \"Yeah, I put it on.\"\n\nI hand him the rules sheet for the item and have him read out loud.\n\"The crown is destroyed if a creature places the crown on its own head. This not only destroys the crown but it also kills the wearer. The wearer cannot be returned to life by any means short of divine intervention.\"\n\nI narrate how his head is destroyed by the SPIKES inside the crown and the whole thing blows up, leaving nothing behind. The rest of the party is stunned for a few seconds and then busts out laughing.\n\nHis reason for trying this?\n\"I thought I could control my own mind\" ",

        "text": "Warning: Immaturity level 7/10\n\nSo, a little while back me and 3 friends did a D&amp;D game (which we still have yet to find a time to finish). It was Melerian Greenleaf the Elven Ranger (Me) Dan the Pie Eater the... I believe human Paladin, and I think my other friends character was Eve... the 12 year old prostitute rogue... yeah I have weird friends. Anyways, We set off on a quest to slay the dragon at the end of Middle Finger Mountain (ha.), however, we had a slight problem...\n\nMelerian:\n\nIt all began when we had slayed for scorpion monkeys, when Dan decided to try and skin the monkey's ball sacks to make a sack for the heads of his victims (please keep in mind this was not my decisions). I decided I'd actually make progress and traveled up the stairs in the dungeon while I left Dan to his business and Eve to explore further in another direction. Up the stairs, there was a nest with 5 monkeys, one oddly larger than the others, sleeping after eating a goat, who was actually still alive. Feeling pity for the goat, I used my incredible stealth to get to the goat without waking the monkeys and heal the goat. Unfortunately, I failed, and not only increased the goat's suffering by healing it, but I also caused it to cry out, waking up the scorpion monkeys and causing them to investigate as I hid behind a table in the room. \n\nEve:\n\nMeanwhile, Eve ventured into a hallway with 3 doors, one barred with wood which she smashed her head against to no avail, 1 leading to a room full of useless armor, and one leading to a room with 3 locusts about the size of a 30 pound dog I'd say. She immediately ran out of the locust room and decided to chuck one of the old weapons at the locusts. She critically failed, however she didn't damage herself, but did alarm the locusts. They swarmed her, and even with her 18 armor, she only had 3 health and they landed lucky shots, causing her to bleed out, as the locusts ran into the room Dan was in, leaving her to bleed.\n\nDan the Pie Eater:\n\nDan noticed the locusts enter the main room he was in as he headed for the stairs to find me, and instantly sprung into action. He sliced at the locusts who managed to do no damage to him, as he chopped off two of the locusts' heads and impaled a 3rd. Seeing the locusts had come from the direction Samantha had went, he went to see what had happened.\n\nMelerian:\n\nI had only just realized I was holding a torch from earlier, so I immediately blew it out and ran, knowing they probably had seen me. I ran for a door, hoping it would be unlocked. It wasn't. I was stuck between a rock and a hard place, the rock being the rock walls and the hard place really being the sharp place, the end of the scorpion monkey's stinger. I thought it'd be the end of the party, Eve dying (of course my character didn't know that however, I wasn't there), me about to die, and Dan having to face his killers, probably resulting in his death. The monkeys attacked, 2 doing only 1 damage each. I was doing okay, but knew I'd be overwhelmed. But then, the big monkey stepped in. He began to stamp the ground like a bull, and charged. But he *missed*. In fact, he slammed into one of the the monkeys, smashing through the wall next to the door, and then immediately turning, missed me AGAIN, and body slammed onto another monkey, crushing it, while swatting a third to the side, injuring it. I decided to take action, and with my 7 ride skill, I was able to get a 6 I believe, getting a 13, so I stayed on, but I had no control. However, he went insane, ran around the room killing the third and smashing into the wall on the OTHER side of the locked door, falling to the ground dazed. I got thrown off, landed without any damage but still roughly so I had to role to get up, and rolled 20 so I could get up and move immediately. I used my sling to kill the charger monkey, then climbed over it and shot the other one as well. I was still panting, surprised I was alive, and that's where we left off. Next time I'm probably going to have the Paladin heal the goat if it's still alive, and he'll probably be called George. Don't ask why, just keep reading.\n\nEve:\n\nEve was bleeding on the ground, at -6 but luckily Dan was able to get there quickly and managed to stop the bleeding. That was also where we left off, he's gonna heal Eve back to full health next time... hopefully.\n\nThank you very much for reading, and I hope you like my story! If I remember, and there are more funny and suspenseful parts after this I'll try to update it!",

        "text": "\n(With Attack/Defense/HP Ratios: the enemies HP wasn't very high, so that's why the numbers are very small. The first boss we chose to do was 50 HP, and he was beat easily. I now consider that in our next game.)\nHere is a story of the most amazing game I've ever hosted. \n\nOk, me and my friends got together and as people who play way too many RPG games, why not try tabletop? I had the most experience in RPG managing and such, so I was picked the GM. We decided to just make some stuff up as we went along. Genre? Fantasy. Enemies? Wolves. Elves? Check. We created a short game, with a few special features. \n\nEach character would pick 3 traits from a small list I had made. One defensive, one offensive, and one special (SPCL as we wrote it). Every level, you picked a new trait. We each had 4 attacks, 3 regular, changeable attacks, and one SPCL move that had to be leveled up. It was fairly simple. We took our turns, the enemies took theirs. Not too complicated. Our HP started at 15, and every Defense we had (Which represented armor and level ups) added to our Defense count. One other feature we had was the ability to buy and sell shops. This would get is Gold, so I allowed it. As our first game, we took it serious enough, by still had some fun. \n\nCharacter one was a small dragon named Kand. He was a bit OP, though we reasoned with him and brought him down to an acceptable level. He did well in battle, and we liked him. Not much to say about him. \n\nCharacter two was my Rouge. He was Jeff, a human male. I chose Silent Assassin as my offensive trait, Dagger as my defensive trait, and Stalk as my SPCL trait. Silent Assassin did 6 damage (Compared to my base weapons 3) and Dagger gave me +1 Attack and +1 Defense for one turn. Stalk meant that an enemy couldn't retreat. He was a simple character. \n\nCharacter three was an Elf archer. He chose Dagger, Barrage (7 damage compare to his base damage of 4) and Double Barrage (12 damage, but only useable once per fight.). He was one of my favorite characters. He was a standard setup, like Jeff. \n\nHere comes the fun part. \n\nCharacter 4 was Jesus fucking Christ.\n\n I'm not joking. \n\nHe was a Mage (though we referred to him as Priest) and had only one offensive attack: The 10 Plagues. For 10 turns the enemy would get a random amount of damage. This wasn't as OP as it may sound. Other than that, he was mainly a healer. Though he had 0 Defense while most of us had 1-3. Of course he still had the 15 HP, but no buff to it. \n\nSo we started our adventures. We attacked a group of raiders while only having Jeff take slight damage before coming to a tiny village. After a while of cutting trees, they allow us to make a small hut where we sell some equipment. \n\nI'll make this story short so that is sounds nice. \n\nWe did this in every. Single. Town. All of them. All of them were 'owned' by our Jesus character too. We pretty much started referring to him as Shopkeeper Jesus. This made for some rather funny encounters. We were attacked by rival shops, a group of theives, and I even put in The Hand Of God as a little joke. \n\nAt the end Jesus had around 1500 Gold. The other three of us combined had 200. \n\nIt was amazing. ",
