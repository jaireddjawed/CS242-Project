        "text": "SPOILERS FOR THE FIRST EPISODE OF THE FOURTH SEASON:\n\nThere is a chance that Robert didn't really believe that these creation were conscious, since creating sentient computer code is A) absurd, B) not something someone actively plans to make happen, and C) not something that most people would believe existed even if they were presented with some evidence suggesting that they are indeed sentient. He might have thought he was just fucking with things that were like extremely advanced versions of the Sims. If he didn't really believe they were alive, then it wouldn't be too difficult to justify. I mean, how many people torture their Sims? Would anyone say those players were evil because of it?\n\nI'm posting this because a lot of people think that Robert is evil and his actions were unforgivable. And he's definitely fucked up in the head! But the mortality of the situation because a lot less clear if he didn't think the code-people were sentient, and, I'd argue, it isn't really evil. At least not in the way I define it: I believe that, for something to be evil, the person needs to at least know that they are hurting someone else.\n\nSome soft evidence:\n\nHe didn't try to profit or become famous from his invention. The creation of sentient code beings would be, in some ways, the greatest technological leap in the history of mankind, but he doesn't use it to establish himself as perhaps the greatest genius in the history of the world or make tons of money. There is no reason to believe that what happens was widespread at the time (everyone acted like it was unprecedented).\n\nWhen the crew escape with the ship, he chases them, rather than just saying 'Exit game' and winning that way. This suggests that he think everything was a game and not a situation worth taking seriously.\n\nHe seems to think that pausing the game pauses the people inside of it as well.",

The first weird dream was about  'playtest' I was stuck in a house with scary crap going on, this one wasn't as memorable. \n\nWhen I woke from this one I just remember going back to sleep soon as I woke up, right after I fell asleep I remember hearing my alarm and then waking, setting it for later then falling back to sleep, and then in my dream I had weirdly agreed to something when I went to sleep and dreamed I got some incriminating emails akin to 'shut up and dance'. I don't remember much else about the dream besides looking at gmail and seeing a file I was for some reason scared of it was titled 'grandma.wmv'.\n\nWell thanks for reading, nothing scares me more then what people can do with modern day technology so some of these episodes are blowing my mind.",

That might not have saved him, but it could be used in a later investigation in hos death.  In Crocodile the protagonist (?) dumps a body at an industrial site.  I would think that a site like that would have cameras.  Arkangel: Privacy Mom doesn't install cameras in the house.  \n\nIt's a fine point, but I find it strange that cameras are so prevalent in our universe, but they don't seem to factor into the writing much.

Just how much does this woman Mia weigh? 80# &amp; after a shower soaking wet? No way she was useful throwing a body in the lake.   The scene where she kills her accomplice was far too easy.  At what point does one realize that tinker bell is trying to kill them and start fighting in earnest??? That entire scene was not believable, including her dragging him around like a sack of very light potatoes afterward.\n2. Same situation with the insurance investigator. Really, these people seemed a little too willing to just give up, like they were humoring her or something.\n3. The baby...wow that was brutal and felt somewhat gratuitous yet was the only physically possible victim out of the whole lot, well ...maybe the guinea pig. \n\n",

I could practically recap every episode for more examples, but to cut straight to the point, Black Mirror showed me there truly are worse fates than death in this tech filled world, and sometimes, death can almost be seen as a reward of a long rest for a long life fully lived.",

Yesterday, after spending about a week in a motel inside dreading life, I felt almost exactly like how the character felt in the episode.

But what's the point of that? If someone really wanted to hack you or spy on you, they can bypass a silly piece of tape. The mic in the camera could still be used. They could still access you search history. You live and operate on a grid everyday. You're constantly around security  cameras. \n\nMaybe if it truly calms you nerves acting that was is a \"good\" thing, but do people seriously think someone might be trying to spy on you like they did to Kenny?\n\nNot trying to be judgmental.

        "text": "Am I the only one feeling a little jaded by the fact that Season 4 seemed rushed, and a drastic departure from the quality episodes we've all become accustomed to?  \n  \nI genuinely feel like this show was well done in previous seasons and was a true pessimistic view of future society where they highlighted true fear, or at least angsty \"uncomfortableness\" in regards to how technology can be utilized to highlight unforeseeable circumstances...  \n  \nI liked only about 2 of the 6 episodes and even then they were episodes that could have been almost true movies. I LOVED 'Black Museum' and 'Metalhead', and to a lesser extent, my wife liked 'Crocodile' but they seemed to be a hanger-on of previous seasons.  \n  \nEven 'Arkangel' seemed contrived solely based on the fact that Jodi Foster directed. Don't get me wrong - as a parent I can associate with the characters in the fact that your child's safety is paramount but it just fizzled after the point was made. Maybe I'm too critical. Maybe it was just a half-assed episode. Regardless, I feel as though things need to be re-evaluated so that we're getting quality episodes.  \n  \nThis seemed like a shallow attempt to bring episodes to market because of the popularity demand of the success of previous seasons for Netflix and less of an actual succession to the IP of the creators who made this show good in the first place.  \n  \nUltimately I think we need to decide if this season is worthy of our accolades since the only way we're going to get good quality episodes in the future is sharing such distaste with the directors and creators to induce them to make better choices on what qualifies as quality in regards to the Black Mirror Universe.",
