        "text": "I used to think that hard work would get you far and no matter how low paying a job is there would always be a way. I used to have good connections in my country, but they were all gone once I moved somewhere else. I started a master degree and after not finding a job in my field I started working in retail. Retail was minimum wage and there was no option for full time for anyone who was not at least an assistant manager. This meant that the most I made was around $1,300 and even that was not guaranteed. One of my managers -I went through 4 different ones- started cutting my hours after I refused to take a co-workers shift when I wasn't even in the city, which the manager knew. I started making less than $300 a month. \n\nI had some support from my parents and partner, so my lack of money didn't hit me as hard, but someone without the right support can easily end up homeless when working retail. Getting a second job might be an option, but with the hectic schedule of many low wage jobs  most places won't accommodate your other job's schedule, so you might end up working few hours. Additionally, it might take a while to find a low wage job with a consistent schedule, but your low income doesn't allow you to live off savings while you find something else.\n\nFurthermore, low wage jobs tend to be unskilled and they're unlikely to lead to something much better paid. For example, a part-time sales clerk can become a keyholder, but a keyholder often doesn't hold a full-time position and barely pays a few cents above minimum wage, and the higher you try to go up the retail ladder the harder it becomes because there's just not many positions at the top.\n\nI'm fortunate to have had my family's support which allowed me to spend my time volunteering in my field and learning marketable skills, but this isn't an option for everyone. Working in retail really opened my eyes to the challenges that people who make low income face.",

It is the most commonly bought and eaten part of the chicken in Germany.\n\nThis is intriguing to me because, in my home country of Turkey, and in most other Asian, Mediterranean, or African countries, the chicken breast is considered the least favorite part of the chicken. It is often seen as the least tasty and most bland part, while drumsticks, thighs, and wings are considered the most delicious and in-demand parts of the chicken. In Turkey, chicken breasts are even used in milk-based desserts because of their lack of flavor.\nBut in Germany, the chicken breast is the most popular part of the chicken!",

We had gone out to a bar the previous night and were both feeling the effects of our wild night out. We wanted to have a good time, but we didn't want to go out and party again. That's when Zack came up with the idea of having a beer challenge.   \n\n\n\"Hey, I have an idea. Let's have a beer challenge,\" Zack said.   \n\n\n\"What's a beer challenge?\" I asked.   \n\n\n\"It's simple. We each drink 4 liters of beer (low alcohol%), and whoever finishes first wins. Are you up for it?\" Zack said.   \n\n\nI hesitated at first, but I eventually agreed to the challenge. We headed to the store to get the beer and returned to my apartment to start the challenge.   \n\n\nWe set up a timer and started to drink. At first, it was all fun and games. We were both laughing and joking around. But as time passed, things started to change.   \n\n\nZack was drinking at a rapid pace, and he was way ahead of me. My belly started to feel full, and I was struggling to keep up. I knew I wasn't going to win, so I decided to have some fun with the situation.   \n\n\nI took out my phone and started taking pictures of Zack's bloated belly. His belly was getting bigger and bigger, and he looked ridiculous. I couldn't help but laugh and tease him.   \n\n\n\"Look at you, man. You look like you're about to give birth,\" I said, laughing.   \n\n\nZack didn't seem to find it as funny as I did. He was getting more and more uncomfortable, and he asked me to stop taking pictures.   \n\n\n\"Come on, man. It's all in good fun,\" I said, trying to keep the mood light.   \n\n\nBut Zack was clearly not having fun anymore. He was getting more and more embarrassed by the minute.   \n\n\n\"Stop, please. I don't want anyone else to see these pictures,\" he said.   \n\n\nI realized then that I had gone too far. I had taken the teasing too far, and I had hurt  \n Zack's feelings. I felt terrible, and I apologized.   \n\n\n\"I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I was just trying to have some fun,\" I said.   \n\n\n\"It's okay,\" Zack said, looking down at his bloated belly. \"I just feel really uncomfortable right now.\"   \n\n\nI promised to delete the pictures (i still kept oneüòÜ), and we continued with the challenge. Zack ended up winning, but We were both bloated and uncomfortable, and we both regretted the challenge.   \n\n\nNOW... He showed a baby pic of me (he found the album in my old shoebox in my apartment containing my old stuff) to my GF earlier as an effort to tease and embarrass me...\n\n  \n I'm thinking of posting the pic here (face covered of course but im sure he will still feel embarrassed) and then I will send him the link with the comments after a day as a funny revenge üòÜ",

The consoling point was that fewer and fewer people would speak to me in English as the years passed by.\n\nThis time, I've been in France for 4 days now and so far I've been talking to everyone in French and no one has switched to English on me so far! My French is far from perfect and maybe this being a non-tourist season also helped, but everyone that I've interacted with (from flight attendants to random passer-bys on the street) would just walk up to me and start speaking in French (this has not been the case in the past because I don't \"look\" like the kind of person who would typically speak French... Rather, I look a typical tourist found in Paris), and when I respond to my clearly flawed French they just kept responding in French! WTF!!\n\nI'm really happy with my progress, that I didn't have to ask them to keep repeating themselves so that I can actually understand what they're saying, and that they understood what I was saying without being confused :) This is such a progress for me and I'm really happy about the progress and the extra opportunity to practice French, but no one around me is a language nerd and I feel uncomfortable bragging about this, so I'm anonymously posting an Reddit instead lol.",

After a rather productive week, both in work and personal aspects, I gave myself permission to install an infamous videogame called League of Legends, which is indeed a great source of suffering, and I usually stay a month every 3 months away from to have a clear mind.\n\nI was inting my ass off with my Gangplank against an Aatrox, hitting good barrels, but getting perma ganked by Lillia, and farming about 7.5 CS/min. An occasional and subtle flame in chat, nothing serious, all in good sport.\n\nAlmost near a decisive drake fight, my Sister, who lives alone, calls me in agony. Vomits, diarrhea, fever. I had to go right away. What does a man do? What can a man do? I teleport and engage into the enemy, hitting a good barrel, but no crits, and although my team came right away, we lost the fight, especially due to a weak ADC.\n\nAs I put on a coat and respawn, I ult a wave to give way to our super minions in bot lane. Our Kassadin was level 16, and I write to my team mates that I have to go. I might be demoted out of my low elo, and I shall find out when I return home.\n\nI get to my sister's home and she can't get out of bed. Can't even drink water. I go to the pharmacy to get her medicine, but the pharmacologist recommends me to get her to the hospital. I help her down the stairs into the car, and we go to the hospital.\n\nEverything is going fast, but she needed serum, and after that, she needs more tests and an x-ray, and I am almost falling asleep. I will not open op.gg to know if I won or lost the game and forget it to enjoy the weekend in nature. She will most like likely be OK. GG WP.",

        "text": "Some examples to illustrate the first point:\n\n* On AskReddit, there were a couple of threads that asked, \"Which country will you never go back to?\", and \"What is the worst country you have visited?\" Egypt was by far the most common answer to these questions, especially on the first thread, and many people shared how they had similarly bad experiences with Egypt.\n\n* A post on r/travel titled, \"Went to Egypt this year. Biggest mistake of my life\", got hundreds of replies, with several people saying how Egypt was the worst country they visited out of literally dozens they have been to. Someone who has visited every single country in the world also mentioned how Egypt was his least favorite.\n\n* Recently, on r/solotravel, a guy found India to be the hardest and most stressful country he has visited, despite having the experience of living in China and traveling to over 60 countries, including many developing countries. Again, there were hundreds of replies which agreed with how they found India to be difficult and unsafe, and several people who had been to over 40 or 50 countries mentioned how India was the worst country they visited, and/or the one country they will never return too.\n\nCommonly cited reasons on Reddit why Egypt and India are so disliked: scams, harassment from vendors on streets, dirty streets, unsafe for women (especially solo women), getting sick from eating food, difficulty of getting around.\n\nHowever, despite all these issues, both countries are still popular destinations due to their histories and cultures. Even on Reddit, there are some people who enjoyed, if not loved, visiting them. \n\nFor those on this sub who are not Indian or Egyptian, would you visit either of the countries despite what many Redditors say? What interests you about them?",

So I get it.\n\nBut that doesn‚Äôt make me want to go out and play in it. That‚Äôs what my spouse wants to do. She always asks kindly, I always hesitate, she shrugs, and jumps in. Every time. Even after a heavy shoveling session when we‚Äôre both sick of the heaviness of it, even if it doesn‚Äôt have that pearly-white look. She still takes the leap. Often looking me straight in the eyes as she falls backwards into the snow. Waving her arms like a child. Sliding her legs like a child. laughing, giggling, smiling like a child.\n\nAnd I stand there, gradually growing a grin until it‚Äôs ear to ear and all I can do is feel that inner-kid-warmth wanting to smash the snow on my face. To see my own angel.\n\nBut it‚Äôs more than that these days. I‚Äôm 37, she‚Äôs 33. We‚Äôre not young, and I feel it some days, when my body is already starting to ache in waysI didn‚Äôt notice before. So when her snow angels convince me to add my own, my body loosens up a bit more. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve lost my youth as much. And that helps get me through the day, especially when winter can be a little bit more dreary than other seasons, not to mention the news and the craziness of the past 3 years and and and and‚Ä¶\n\nAll this to say, do yourself a favor and make a snow angel once in a while. It might bring you closer to your spouse. It might remind you of the kid used to be. And maybe, just maybe, it might make you giggle uncontrollably and see the world a little bit better.",

        "text": "Hi!\n\nSo about a month ago i got pretty strong deja vu two days in a row, once on both days. Since then i've gotten it on/off several times a week, most frequently at night when i'm on my phone or computer doing casual stuff, like watching videos or chatting. I got it once in the morning after waking up when i watching some tiktok.\n\nNot all the deja vus i get are strong or even easily recognizable as deja vu - very often i just get a \"mild\" sense of familiarity which makes me question if the situation has happened before or not. It's still sudden and random enough for me to pay attention to it though.\n\nI should also note that almost everytime, even when getting the strong ones, i recognize that there are (a lot of) familiar elements in those situations that i encounter in my daily life. However it still feels more like deja vu and not regular remembering/recollection as it comes on so suddenly and can be strong. \n\nI don't seek medical advice or anything like that from here, just thought of posting in case anyone has had similiar experiences or is interested in discussing this topic.",

        "text": "I  watched the movie for the third time yesterday. Which is crazy for me  on it's own. This is the first movie ever that I watched more than twice  in the theatre. And I'm saying this, while also being a lifelong star  wars fan! Go figure... But also, this movie was the first one ever that I  watch on my own in the cinema. Avatar is breaking my personal records  too!\n\nBut anyway, with movies I  always favor the original dub to the translation. For some unimportant  reasons however, two out of my three watches was in the hungarian dub.  And I have to say it is incredibly well done.\n\nA  little context: hungarian dub has always been very high quality. The  voice actors are actual theatre and movie actors, the lip sync is always  well done and usually a big actor (say Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise) is  dubbed by the same hungarian actor in every movie, so it's very  consistent for the national audience and the hungarian counterpart  always sounds a lot like the original actor too. However the translators  tend to get a little wild here and there. Usually it's all fine, but  sometimes they bend the meaning behind something or use the oldest  phrases ever. This summer I watched the new Top Gun in hungarian too and  the one liners in the action sequences sounded like they were written  in the 60s. Like noone talks like that anymore.\n\nNaturally  the voice actors in TWoW are amazing as always. They kept all the  voices from the 2009 dub, which were already great. And the kids were  pretty well done too. My personal favourite is Kiri who in the original  obviously has Sigourney Weaver's teenager voice, which makes her sound  like an old soul (which she is) I guess. In the hungarian she isn't  voiced by Sigourney's usual voice actor but they found a younger actress  who actually has that old soul-feel to her voice. Very well done.\n\nBut  the translation is where the dub really stood out for me. There is not  one weird sounding hungarian line in the entire script. And if you  consider the heavy slang (especially the constant *bros*)  Loak and Spider uses this is a pretty great achievement I would say.  They actually used today's slang words that best fit the english  counterparts. I was surprised twice now, how well they made this work.\n\nAnd  a little extra fun fact is that Spider was translated Gekk√≥ (Gecko)  probably to make the syllabels work. Since the actual translation of  Spider would have been P√≥k and that's probably too short for the lip  synch. Now this is exactly the kind of weird mistranslation that I  mentioned above and that I usually don't like, but this one I actually  love. It's close enough in meaning and now I actually think it suits the  character better. It's less menacing.",
