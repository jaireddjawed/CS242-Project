I’m from West Virginia in the United States, but I have family that lives in Indiana, where they have a noticeably different accent. When I travel to Indiana, all of the natives immediately notice my accent and ask where I’m from because according to them, it’s very noticeably different than theirs. However, this effect doesn’t seem to go the other way. From what I can hear, people in Indiana don’t sound that different than me. If you were to have someone from Indiana visit the part of West Virginia where I live, I probably wouldn’t even notice that they have a different accent. I’ve asked friends that live in West Virginia and they said they also couldn’t hear much of a difference in our accents. So why is it that my accent is noticeable but it doesn’t go the other way?",

        "text": "I’m from China so I’m not as familiar in European history. It seems Latin, once dominant in Europe, diverged and became Romance languages and later itself died. Why is this process considered dying instead of evolving?\nI’d like to compare Latin with Chinese. In scient times, they were both used by a large population across a large landscape. They both had an official, formal variation used by educated people, and an informal variation spoken by commoners, and they differed a lot. After centuries, Chinese now has so many local variations like Mandarin, Cantonese and Hokkien/Taiwanese. None of these languages is the same as what old Chinese was centuries ago, speaking-wise or writing-wise. However, no one thinks Chinese dead; it simply evolved into the different dialects/languages now. Do other languages go through a similar process? Are they considered dead now?\nAlso, why is Italian not considered “a/the modern Latin after centuries of development”, just like how Mandarin is the modern standard Chinese?\nMy best guess is this is a political issue, as Roman empires fell and Europe is split most of the time, while China continuously survives and is unified most of the time.",

        "text": "For those who don't know him, JJ McCulloch is a Canadian YouTuber. Some of his content is interesting but something that always pulls me out when I'm starting to enjoy his videos is his pronunciation of \"about\". He literally does a full on Terrance and Phillip-style \"aboot\". He also does this with the word \"around\". However, he doesn't do this certain other words like \"south\", \"out\" and \"amount\". There is examples of all of these in this video - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xprzqBFv1M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xprzqBFv1M)\n\nI grew up in Scotland and around people who spoke Scots, and in Scots the \"ou\" vowel (I'm sorry, I'm not even close to an expert on linguistics) is always pronounced \"oo\" - about actually is pronounced \"aboot\". South, out and amount are all pronounced \"sooth\", \"oot\" and \"amoont\".\n\nI've also lived in Vancouver for a long time and have never once heard a local say \"aboot\". Even my East Coast friends aren't even close.\n\nThe leads me to think that either:\n\n a) Either McCulloch is faking his accent as a sort of gimmick, and doesn't realize all the different instances when he would have to replace \"ou\" with \"oo\" (again, sorry)\n\nb) He has an idiolect that just happens to be the most stereotypical Canadian accent feature\n\nc) maybe there is actually a difference between how \"oo\" and \"ou\" are realized in Scots and Canadian English depending on the context that it occurs in a word? Or perhaps something to do with the fact that Scots is a dialect/language and McCulloch's Canadian English is an accent?",

Spoken English names often stress the first syllable and have a falling tone on the last syllable (eg JOHN-a-than, HEN-ry, STA-cy). But when chanted, the last syllable is stressed and has a rising tone. I realized it’s a similar chant pattern for Italian and Spanish kids.\n\nIt made sense to stress the last syllable to keep the rhythmic pattern of the chant, but I was wondering if this is a universal pattern, or just something in Germanic and Romance languages?",

        "text": "Over the last few months I have been delving into some of the details about Large Language Models (LLMs) such as the GPT variants being developed by OpenAI and other companies such as Microsoft. While the professional establishment has characterized these LLMs as \"stochastic parrots\" (see [https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/dangers-stochastic-parrots](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/dangers-stochastic-parrots) ), the behavior struck me as something more than just a parrot, but less than human. Specifically, I've been pondering if language itself is a living parasite, and humans are the symbiotic host for that parasite.\n\nI soon thought, I can't be the first person to come up with this idea, and sure enough, there is the linguistic philosophy of Symbiosism, which has a long history. This provides a good outline: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249904767_Symbiosism_Symbiomism_and_the_Leiden_definition_of_the_meme](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249904767_Symbiosism_Symbiomism_and_the_Leiden_definition_of_the_meme)\n\nIf language is a living organism in it's own right and humans are the parasitic host, then it could be that what computer scientists and engineers are doing by building these LLMs is creating a kind of composite language parasite and instantiating it outside of its normal host. If so, we could have a fertile opportunity to study the language organism separate from that host, something we couldn't really do before. It could be a way to really test out and the Symbiosism philosophy in practice, and get a better understanding of what we are doing (there are also some significant new ethical considerations to make I think if language is in fact a living organism).\n\nThoughts?",

Ibrahim son of Azhar, may peace be upon him, around Ur of the Chaldees, circa 2000 BCE (4023 years ago!):\n\n\"Amar-ânn ullûm Akannaka la mada Ilu, šū eli edaniu Allallu, u amar-ânn Ullûm atta, Ibrahim, Allallu-ya ibr-âta.\"\n\nI haven't found the time to translate the letters to Cuneiform. If you are interested, I might follow up :). If you guys want my notes, sources, etc, lmk!",

This peculiarity applies to a few other place names such as Angola, Moçambique, Cabo Verde, São Tomé e Príncipe, Essuatíni, Macau, Timor Leste, Andorra, Israel, São Salvador, Aragão, Castela and Leão.

        "text": "Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

I’d have to leave my job since I couldn’t do both full-time, but does a master’s really present better opportunities in this field? I would love to do some actual linguistics research but I’m worried I’ll never find anything well-paying, especially if I want to look into historical linguistics or language preservation/revitalization. Like would a prospective employer look at a linguistics master’s and think anything of it, or is it better for me to just deal with the job I have now?",

The distinction is probably similar to that of much vs. many, respectively!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3) My translation of “kmariani” was off. I correctly assumed that -ani was a possessive/relational affix used to form adjectives from nouns. But my next assumption was that “kmari” can probably mean “man” (as in “man and wife”), with the adjective being “manly”. While the correct line of thinking is: husband + possessive affix = “having a husband”, i.e. “married”. The affix meaning would be more evident if we tried to rephrase the translations: e.g. regarding “didmnišvnelovani” as “having a lot of meaning”.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Puzzle 2**\n\n*by I.A. Muravyova, adapted*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKoryak is a Chukotko-Kamchatkan language spoken by less than 2,000 people in the easternmost extremity of Siberia. Its first writing system was created in 1931 based on Latin script, but it was only used for a few years, before switching to Cyrillic-based in 1937. During the pre-writing period, Koryaks used an original system of symbols that had ideograms for things like days, people, modes of transport and principal commodities, such as types of boats, tobacco, mittens, furs, etc. It also utilised a basic set of numerals, with | for ones, Х for tens, ⃝ for hundreds, and⊗for thousands\n\nejek — эек — lamp\n\nļəļapək — лыляпык — look\n\nqojaŋa — қояңа — reindeer\n\nļaŋe — ляңэ — girl\n\nļuqej — люқэй — milk\n\nwajampiļ — в’аямпиль — brook\n\nkokjolꜧən — кокъёлгын — hole (in the ground)\n\naļvaŋ — альваң — let\n\nliŋliŋ — лиңлиң — heart\n\naŋjak — аңъяк — answer\n\naməļļoka — амыллёка — deftly\n\nņəmqəqin — нымқықин vsmall\n\npeņņək — пэнник — attack\n\nənnin — ыннин — this\n\njiŋlək — йиңлык — throw\n\ntəņņin — тыннин — I stitched it up\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Write in Cyrillic:*** jejolək (understand), juŋəj (whale), wəjilwəjil (shadow), qaļꜧajak (cry), ļəmŋəļ (fairy-tale), ļaļļaļ (duck).\n\n\\*For those of you who know how to read Cyrillic, this is quite a bit easier. Here’s what you would already know:\n\n&gt;!я, ё, ю, е, и are variants of а, о, у, э, ы, respectively, and indicate that the preceding consonant is palatalised. As standalones or after vowels or ь/ъ all of them, except и, read as diphthongs starting with /j/.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!ь also indicates palatalisation of the preceding consonant but does itself not make a sound. ъ is similarly voiceless, it indicates the lack of palatalisation before я, ё, ю, е, and и, and that such  following letter reads as a diphthong.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Short answer:*** &gt;!jejolək = еёлык, juŋəj = юңый, wəjilwəjil = в’ыйилв’ыйил, qaļꜧajak = қальгаяк, ļəmŋəļ = лымңыль, ļaļļaļ = ляльляль!&lt;\n\nIf you solved it without knowing Cyrillic or checking the spoiler above, please share your thinking process in the comments!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Explanation:*** &gt;!1) Less-than-straightforward correspondences are for letters like ņ and ļ, and j+V combinations.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2) The pair of aŋjak — аңъяк is a good example for the second issue, showing that a = a, but ja = я. Same in wajampiļ — в’аямпиль. Similar correspondence for o can be seen in kokjolꜧən — кокъёлгын, where o = o, but jo = ё. And ejek — эек gives us the letters э (for e) and e (for je). Ы/и does not really pose a difficulty, since different letters are used in Latin script for these, but there’s a trick, nevertheless: ji combination does not correspond to a single letter in Cyrillic, yielding йи instead, as seen in jiŋlək — йиңлык.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3) Now for the consonants. Final ļ corresponds to ль, as seen in wajampiļ — в’аямпиль, and the same goes for ļ before another consonant: aļvaŋ — альваң. Otherwise, it’s better to look at CV combinations, not separate letters. This gives us a number of correspondences from ļəļapək — лыляпык etc.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!ъ in kokjolꜧən — кокъёлгын can be a bit tricky (although irrelevant for solving the task), but you since it’s the only Cj combination, it is possible to assume that ъ gets inserted in the middle of such combinations.!&lt;",

        "text": "I find it both interesting and baffling how English speakers, teachers and even some linguists distinguish 'accents' from 'dialects' in varieties of English, limiting accents simply to the 'the way words are pronounced' and dialects to 'differences in vocabulary and grammar'. Though I definitely think there is a lot of merit to refer to some forms of English as simply 'accents', I, as an outsider, find it surprising how 'accents' are applied to some forms of English with such a striking difference that in another language those would only be referred to as dialects.\n\nFor one, I think it is silly to limit the definition of a dialect to simply vocabulary and grammar and to disregard phonology. Comparing the way someone from California speaks to a speaker from San-Francisco the difference in all three aspects will be minor between them and I personally can definitely see why these varieties might be referred to as accents. Both are quite close to each other and neither had a lot of time to develop separately. However, comparing an Essex speech to Manchester I find   that naming those speeches as 'accents' is very arbitrary since those varieties not only posses noticeable differences in auditory qualities of shared phonemes, but also have different sets of phonemes all-together. Not to mention intonation, speech patterns, vocabulary and some grammatical differences. Setting vocabulary and grammar aside, why is it that when discussing the sound of those speeches people will use the  word 'accent' to describe the differences? Seems as if the English speaking world is stuck in Middle Ages with this narrow-minded description of speech differences.",

I can't help but notice some similarities between the two, even though they are not related.\n\nFor instance, in both languages, there exist two classes of adjectives (as well as adverbs). One contains those that are graded by adding the correct suffix (or a prefix in Polish), so for instance, \"hot, hotter, the hottest\". On the other hand, there are those that are graded with the addition of superlative words in front. We won't say, \"exquisiter\", or \"exquisitest\", but rather, \"more exquisite\", and \"the most exquisite. And then, there are those that take completely different shape in the superlative forms, like, \"good\".\n\nAll of that is in Polish as well as English. Dobry/lepszy/najlepszy vs good/better/the best. In both of those cases, the superlative forms are totally different than the basic one.\n\nThere are also many other similarities. Fir instance, some ideas are conceptualized similarly. In both Polish and English, time is conceptualized as something that flows (\"the flow of time\").\n\nI wonder, why do such strikingly obvious similarities exist between languages with no relation to one another?",

I'm having trouble deciding the best way to translate her dialogue into English, and I was hoping to get some input from the community.\n\nHere are the options I'm considering:\n\nIgnore the accent: Should I simply translate her dialogue without including the \"aru\" at the end of her sentences? This would make her dialogue sound more natural in English, but it would also mean that I'm not fully capturing the character's accent.\n\nAdd \"aru\" to the end of sentences: Alternatively, I could include \"aru\" at the end of each of her sentences to convey her accent. However, I'm not sure if this would come across as too gimmicky or make her dialogue hard to read.\n\nWrite her dialogue in a stereotypical Chinese accent: Another option would be to write her dialogue with a stereotypical Chinese accent in English (e.g. \"Me so solly\"), but I'm worried this could come across as offensive or insensitive.\n\nAdd appropriate Chinese words and phrases: Finally, I could add appropriate Chinese words and phrases to her dialogue to emphasize her ethnicity and cultural background. However, this could also make the dialogue harder to read for English-speaking audiences who aren't familiar with Chinese.\n\nWhat do you think would be the best approach?

Does the “-s” make a difference?\n\nI’m not familiar with the phonestheme literature, but I was wondering if there’s a difference between “related words that share phonetic features because the newer word is a derivation” and “related words that share phonetic features because they derive from the same original word.” \n\nI’m thinking of “sniff” and “sniffle”. Dictionary.com says sniffle is sniff + -le and is first recorded about 300 years after sniff. Sniff came first, then sniffle took the original main meaning of sniffle and changed it slightly for the new word.\n\n“Wa-” came to mind for words like “water” and “wash”. They’re contextually related words and I could see similarities between /wat-/ and /waʃ-/. Dictionary.com says “wash” is “from Proto-Germanic *watskan*, equivalent to *wat-* (root of water)”. Going back further you have PIE *wed-.\n\nWould “wash” be a derivation of “water” like sniff/sniffle, or are they independently derived from PIE? Is it more like a straight line that water&gt;wash or is it more like a branching tree with *wed- at the center? Is there a difference?\n\nReflexively I would think that more basic/Swadesh-type of words would be present earlier, but I’m not sure if that’s accurate.\n\nGetting back to phonesthemes, is there any difference from light/vision “gl-” words that derived from previous gl- words (maybe “glow” is earliest?) and carry over the light/vision relation, compared to an even earlier “gl-” root word that some of the current gl- words derived independently from and have the light/vision relation from the original word? Maybe “glow and “glare” are daughters of (hypothetical) PIE *gl- and “glint” is a daughter of “glow” separate from “glare” whose daughter is “gleam”?",
