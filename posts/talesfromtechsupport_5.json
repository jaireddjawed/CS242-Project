        "text": " Greetings,\n\nI wanted to start a trend here with stories. Anyone that is anyone who works in tech support (help desk, desktop support, QA, Networking, etc.) has a story to tell. Post up your best stories.\n\nRules of the stories\n\n* no disclosing birth names of users\n* no disclosing names of company\n* nothing racial (that should go without saying)\n* any vulgar works, BLEEP them out\n* have fun with it\n\nI'll go first:\n\nI worked as a level 1/2 technician at an undisclosed law firm some years ago.\n\nA user reached out to me via phone and I answered:\n\n\\*me\\* Hello this is tech support, how may i assist you?\n\n\\*user\\* yes, hi. there seems to be an issue with my computer and i want someone to stop by and take a look at it please\n\n\\*me\\* sure i could stop by shortly. could you tell me what the issue is so I know what tools i need to bring?\n\n\\*user\\* yes thank you, my coffee cup holder isn't working\n\n\\*at first silence, then i speak\\* I'm sorry did you just say that your 'coffee cup holder isn't working'?\n\n\\*user\\* yes that's correct. can you come over please?\n\n\\*me\\* uh yeah sure. I will be there soon.\n\nNot knowing what to expect, I bring my full toolkit as a just in case. I arrive and introduced myself as tech support\n\n\\*user\\* thank you for coming so quick. so here is the coffee cup holder\n\nUser proceeds to point to ... the CD ROM drive.\n\nRight below that, it is wet with coffee and seemingly dripping out of the desktop\n\n\\*me\\* I apologize but that is not a coffee cup folder.\n\nand I then proceed to educate the person to what the CD ROM drive is actually for. We went ahead and saved all their work when all of the sudden, smoke comes out of the desktop. I immediately pulled the power cord out of the wall and without even missing a beat, the user then says.\n\n\\*user\\* why is the computer smoking?\n\nI had a hard time not cracking up but explained what happens when you mix liquid with electronics and it finally clicked for them.",

On the 4th one I got there and went straight to her office.\n\n\"So your mouse isn't working again?\"\n\n\"Yeah! I don't know why it keeps doing it. But every time I plug my laptop back in after taking it home the mouse won't work. I usually just unplug it and back a few times and it starts working on its own.\"\n\n\"Oh that's weird!\" I said to her even though I suspected she just wasn't waiting for the USB driver to load on startup.\n\n\"Yes! And it's doing it again today!\"\n\nSo I took a look at the mouse, followed the cord around, and found the USB plugged snugly into the RJ45 port. (Little did I know they were the same width)\n\nI explained nicely to her that the mouse needed to be plugged into the USB port on the other side. A week went by.\n\nMonday morning, same user, same voice-mail, same problem, same solution.\n\nAnd then it happened AGAIN. From what I could tell she had plugged her USB mouse into her ethernet port on 6 consecutive Monday mornings before she figured out what she was doing wrong.",

        "text": "Yesterday (Monday) I came to the office, and for some reason, most of our phones were down. I did troubleshooting on them, called the company, they said it looks like the phones are dead. Ordered new phones.\n\nToday I get to the office early, and nothing is working. No phones, no computers, nothing can connect to the internet. I'm like, what the hell is going on...\n\nLast Friday we had a bunch of storms roll through and knock out power for a few minutes, on and off. Yesterday I was thinking that maybe the power outage blew up the phones somehow, 'cause some of them were still working. But then I plugged in a spare phone that was new in the box to test it... dead.\n\n\\**angry IT Guy noises*\\*\n\nThen today nothing would connect at all. I'm thinking \"Did the storms blow out my network switch somehow?\" Except there were three devices in the building that still had connectivity throughout all this, and they were all connected to the switch with all the other devices that were failing. And some of the devices that weren't working earlier started working for a bit, and then stopped again.\n\nNow I'm even *more* confused.\n\nThen I logged onto the one computer that could still connect, and went back to my training: I ran ipconfig. Checked all the settings, everything looked right. I checked all the settings on another computer that couldn't connect, and the Default Gateway was wrong. I'm like, \"why do these two have different Default Gateways... how the hell did that happen...\"\n\nAnd then I realized what the IP address it was pointing to was:\n\nThe security camera DVR.\n\nTuesday of last week, the security camera company came in and put in a new DVR. For reasons I don't understand, even though they knew the old camera DVR was on my main network and all the cameras they were setting up were analog cameras directly connected to the DVR... they set it up as a DHCP server. So when Friday rolled around and the storms knocked out our power, everything started getting its IP addresses from the DVR instead of my network's DHCP server.\n\nWent into the DVR settings to confirm... sure enough, they had its DHCP server turned on. Turned that off, rebooted my network switches, and everything went back to normal.\n\nIt's Tuesday and I already feel like I've worked a full week.",

        "text": "I worked at a vending company that placed vending and arcade machines at locations like restaurants, bars and similar in exchange for either paying a fixed rent to the location owner or splitting the profits with the location owner. They also rented machines out for events and parties and such.\n\nThis place for the most part had actual competent techs working for it. Unfortunately, I wasn't so great at helping to move large items, and they needed that more than they needed a full time tech due to their rentals and events, therefore I had a relatively short period of employment there.\n\nOne day, we got a call from a bar that our shooting game was initially starting up okay when they turned it on upon opening up the bar, but later on it would black out and show \"no signal\" on the screen. (yes, some arcade monitors do that). We knew by the title, that this was one of those games that had a computer tower inside acting as the \"brain\" of the game rather than a custom arcade motherboard. This also meant that the tower in some cases used a standard ATX power supply, which we had several of laying round as spares for these types of games. \n\nAfter finding a power supply and verifying it worked using our tester, I headed over to the bar. \n\nIt was soon enough after opening that the machine had not shut itself down yet, but I decided to do some exploratory \"surgery\" on it rather than just wait around for it to go wrong. I opened the back cover with the key, and thankfully, there is plenty of room around the tower to take it's cover off while it's still in place. I popped the cover off, and I saw that the CPU fan wasn't turning anymore. Well, darn. I don't think we have a spare of that. On the other hand, we caught it before the actual CPU failed: score one for whoever designed this motherboard. Clearly the computer was going into thermal shutdown. \n\nI noted in the ticket that the CPU fan was broken, and I took pictures of both the fan itself and the model number on the computer tower case, so that we could figure out what fan to order, or find a broken tower of the same model to pull a fan from.\n\nEven with thermal throttling and shutdown, it's not wise to continue to run something that has improper cooling, because hitting the upper limit repeatedly is still a good way to cause failure sooner or later. The machine had a removable power cord, so I decided to take it with me - and let the bar manager know the reason I was taking it with me. He appeared to understand so I went on my way. I also made a call to the boss and explained the whole thing. \n\nFast forward about 4 weeks.\n\nWhile I was out replacing the monitor on another machine in a different location, I got a call from my boss. He said that (same shooting game) is broken down at (address) and just showing \"No Signal\" on the screen. The address sounded familiar, but I didn't make the connection in the moment. As I got closer to the location, the realization hit that it's the same one I had found the fan broken in..... But how did they even get to the point of saying \"No Signal\"? \n\nI entered the bar and just as I suspected, there was another power cord attached and plugged in. Sure enough, the screen is saying \"No Signal\". I tried to reboot it, however, instead of the single short \"beep\" that this machine usually made on startup, I get an ominous series of long beeps. I forget what the pattern was offhand, but it wasn't what you would want to hear when booting up a computer.\n\nI took the back cover off again and found that whoever put the new power cord on hadn't even closed up the tower so it was still open. More importantly, the fan was still broken, so the CPU had been started and forced to run up to it's limits multiple times. \n\nNormally, I would try reseating the RAM and possibly the CPU and graphics card to see if that fixes the problem. My hope of that working here was quite thin, knowing what's happened, but I might as well try something while I'm here. \n\nI pulled out the RAM first amd put it back in. No change. Then I tried the graphics card. No change. The thing I saved for last, because it's not a pleasant task due to the thermal paste, is the CPU. Well, whatever, I might as well get it over with. So, I unscrewed the heat sink, removed it, undid the lock on the CPU socket and removed the CPU, then put it back in and reattached the heat sink. Lights, Camera, Action! Power on and, just as I suspected, no change. I get the same error beeps. Drat. \n\nI called my boss to see if he knew anything about the power cord finding it's way back to the bar.\n\nIt turns out that he had gotten a call that \"the power cord is missing\" and he had just sent one of the other employees out there with another power cord, and that guy had just plugged it in, and when it booted up in front of him he (understandably) assumed all was well. However, neither that employee OR my boss had bothered to look at the ticket. The restaurant manager didn't mention anything either, and apparently assumed the problem was fixed or forgot what I had said, and didn't unplug the machine. \n\nI calmly reminded my boss to check the ticket from 4 weeks ago that had my name on it. After a moment of silence on his part, he surprisingly doesn't find a way to blame me, for once. Score one for him, but that's about all he got due to his generally poor attitude. Well, maybe two because he wouldn't have stood for the kind of crap that went on at the other game room store I had worked for previously. \n\nThe guy who didn't look at the ticket got an earful from the boss, but I don't think that was entirely fair because the boss could have checked the ticket himself, or the call-taker if it wasn't the boss. (I don't know who picked up the \"power cord is missing\" call). I told that employee that I didn't blame him.\n\nTL;DR: The crap hit the fan, but the fan wasn't working anymore so the crap just stayed there.",

        "text": "Thank you all so much for the positive feedback and awards across my other posts, I've only been contributing for a couple of weeks but it means a great deal and encourages me to churn out more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI introduced Colleague to MyBoss and that’s how he got the job. Years before I’d been round to see Colleague or “C” one evening, he was tearing his hair out trying to get a PC set up. It was one of those one step forward two steps back nights for him. He had no home internet and this was before smartphones or mobile internet were common.\n\nI don’t remember the specifics but you’ll get the idea of the spiral he was in.\n\nC: “Why won’t the XP installer see my hard drives??”\n\nMe: “What does it say in the BIOS?”\n\nC: “SE\\]&amp;/TE B;@#ACUD?”\n\nMe: “IDE conflict, check your jumpers on both hard drives” (for he had two)\n\nC pulls the drives and cables out and examines them, corrects the jumper settings.\n\nC: “Cool it shows up properly as SEAGATE BARRACUDA now!” (and whatever the other one was)\n\nC proceeds to install.\n\nC: “It’s bombed out! Why did the install fail?”\n\nMe: “Test the HDD?”\n\nC runs a disk diagnostic but it doesn’t yield a pass/fail. There was a fault trying to test it at all.\n\nMe: “Unplug one of the hard drives and try with the minimum plugged in”\n\nC pulls drives and cables out again, unplugs one drive.\n\nC: “It’s still failing”\n\nMe: “Ok well we didn’t get a valid test before, lets try the diag tool again”\n\nC: “It’s still not able to test the drive properly”\n\nMe: “Try the other drive”\n\nC pulls drives and cables out again, swaps them over.\n\nC: “Install failing on this one too!”\n\nMe: “Right, test that drive”\n\nC: “Same thing! Still can’t run the test!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can imagine he’s been at it since before I arrived, poor thing. Nothing makes sense, nothing works, he’s started going through the five stages of grief I think. Denial, Anger and Depression certainly. He’s absolutely miserable after hours into the endeavour.\n\nMe: “umm….”\n\nC is glum. He wants his PC to work. It doesn’t. He can’t fix it. He is very sad. He is a forlorn puppy, tired and defeated.\n\nMe: “S\\*\\*\\* sorry dude. Not much else I can think of without internet to research or download anything”\n\nC: “Yeah I know… no worries, thanks for trying”\n\nI do not like this either. I am autistic, though I won’t know that for another decade and a half. My brain sees a problem and it has the raw, biological impulse to solve it. I must fix it. It is wrong, it must be made right. Some people have called me helpful, some have called me kind even. If you say so, but that’s not what is going on upstairs. I’m glad it benefits others if I can but it’s coincidental to me. One of the most aggravating things for me is when someone says they have a problem with their computer but say no it’s fine I’ll deal with it or get a new one, “BUT I HAVE CABLES.. I HAVE COMPONENTS..”\n\nIt’s the lizard part of my brain. Before thought, before feeling, like the defensive systems wired directly into the nervous system that make you shut your eye before something hits it or to release something picked up much hotter than expected. As the spider waits, as the rabbit flees. Devoid of cunning or cruelty, simply “fix”. No words, no concepts, just “fix”. There is no u/SubstantialTerm3843, only ~~Zuul~~ “fix”. \n\nWithout hope, without reward.\n\nHundreds of millions of years of evolutionary development gaze down upon the open tower. Untold generations of neurological divergence stare blankly over the motherboard, the jumpers, the drives, the ripples of ribbon cables. Something pure, something of the Divine speaks to me through the static and the tinnitus. I achieve Sennin Mode.\n\nfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixitfixit\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMe: “If the cables weren’t knackered before all that plugging and unplugging won’t have helped, have you got another IDE cable?”\n\nC gasps, C scurries. C replaces the ribbon cable.\n\nC: “OMG it’s working!! OMG it’s installing!! OMG dude it’s happening!! OMG!! OMG!!”\n\nC is ecstatic. C is back from the brink. C was lost in the dark forest as Dante was, but C gets to skip all that. C is in his own little world, mumbling gratitude but utterly captured in that familiar old screen, the blue background, the green progress bar, the primary colours of the Windows logo. C is awash with tranquillity.\n\nC is presented with the prompt for the product key. C wails, a moan of heartbreaking calamity.\n\nC, to no one: “I don’t suppose anyone has an XP license key?”\n\nC has arrived at Bargaining, but C is bereft. No eye contact, no expectation. C approaches Acceptance.\n\nMe, still placid and blank faced: “ABCDE-“\n\nC, uncomprehending: “…what?”\n\nI nod toward the keyboard. \n\nMe: “ABCDE-“\n\nC dares not to hope, but eyes wide takes direction and begins typing.\n\nMe: “FGHIJ-KLMNO-PQRST-UVWXY”\n\nC presses enter. C remains silent. C needs a moment. C barely breathes for the remainder but soon enough, he is Welcome.  And it’s blue skies, fluffy white clouds and rolling green hills once more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*D\\*O\\*P\\*A\\*M\\*I\\*N\\*E\\*S\\*",

        "text": "So...\n\nUnlike my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/92ksjk/never_trust_the_guy_thats_leaving/) [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8m94wc/its_installed_where/), this is one that i hope gets a bit of a chuckle. Mainly because of just how stupid it is!\n\nAs I was starting in my previous role, construction was wrapping up on a new building that was going to be specifically for students in higher education.  it was a glorious monstrosity. Built up from ideas that a dozen people on a committee thought were amazing design choices that would make the school look more modern.\n\nHigh (very high) ceilings, glass everywhere. a wonderful opaque bit at the front that would house a pulsing light that constantly changed colour. Blah blah blah.\n\nBasically, what I'm saying is that, as is always the way, what it looked like was given more attention than boring stuff like infrastructure, cabling, etc etc. \n\nAbout three weeks after the building was opened to teach in, we get a call that the data projector on the ceiling has suddenly stopped working. the entire inside of the building had been put together by contractors. Everything installed without any consultation with the support team and being that the building opened late, we barely had a chance to look at stuff before it was being used to teach!\n\nOff I go to take a look. it's a new projector, it must be a loose cable or something equally dumb. right?\n\nNOPE!\n\nSure enough, the projector isn't working. no power, won't switch on, nothing.\n\nI grab my boss (mainly because i need a sanity check and a second man for a ladder to get into those ceilings) and we start unpicking cables behind the projector.\n\nHead firmly in the false ceiling, I trace the power cable back to a mains socket in the ceiling and unplug/replug it. Nothing.\n\nI swap out the power cable. Zip.\n\nI grab the site team and we go and check the trip switches. Naff all.\n\nI swap out the projector. Nada\n\n2 hours into this issue we are on the phone to the installers asking them to come take a look. \"Tomorrow\" they say. We make our apologies to the teacher and wait.\n\nThe next day, the installers arrive and we walk into a classroom with a fully working projector!!! No one knows how, it just sprang to life in the middle of the last lesson the day before!  Slightly embarrassed, we send the fitters away and get on with our day.\n\nA day later the same thing happens again! No power, no nothing. Now I'm in the ceiling on the phone to the installers and he asks me...\n\n\"Have you checked the switch for the mains\"\n\nWait! What? What switch? There is no switch! I've spent hours LOOKING for a switch.\n\n\"Yes mate, it's on the dado railing around the room. every class has one\"\n\nOh for fuck's sake! Really?\n\nI stick my head out the ceiling and look down, sure enough, there's a power switch in the cable trunking. I ask a student, sheepishly, to flip the switch for me. *Due to the extreme height, he can't hear me and I have to send down a telegram with the hiking guide that got me up here*, the projector wakes up and springs to life - showing the teacher's personal email address to the class in the process!\n\nIt turns out that the projector was accidentally (or not, this was early in my education career, i learned different very quick) being switched off and on my students leaning back in their chars against the wall and knocking the switch! \n\nEmbarrassed, i quickly slinked off for a coffee and a smoke and tried to forget it ever happened.\n\nIt did lead to years of laughs though when it happened over and over again and I looked magic by just waltzing in and flicking the switch on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Too often they got shiny, new laptops.  We also made a New Hire sheet with all the info for them to start here first, including how to change your password.  Every so often, a new hire or in this case, the Intern, came to me with how to change it.  So I pull my usual solution of getting a copy of the New Hire sheet and said\n&gt;Well, on the New Hire sheet, it says here...\n\n  \n\nNext issue, and the main reason for the post, was at the end of the day, were I typically was the busiest trying to wrap things up (and users came to me with last minute issues knowing I was about to leave).  Intern came to me needing a network cable for the next room, a minor request, however I was dealing with a moderate networking issue of some kind and asked him to wait a couple minutes.  Rather than wait, he looked around my little office of a server room, spied a network cable that appeared to be available, and tried to take it.  However, that was for THE server and my presence there was the only thing that stopped him from disconnecting the main server.  Only person I recall needing to order out of the server room.  Yes, he did still get his cable.\n\n  \n\nLast IT related issue was that despite being an intern with a brand new laptop, he didn't take good care of it and in the 2 weeks he was there, it was stolen.  His replacement laptop was an older model, recently repaired.\n\n  \n\nFinally, he wasn't just brash with IT, and I could clearly tell that while some other interns, including his best friend there, would comeback for other internships or job offer, \"sadly\" BadIntern did not.\n\n  \n\nTL;DR Intern can't read New Hire sheet, nearly unplugs server due to impatience, loses new laptop.  Does not come back.",

        "text": "**Part III**\n\n**Day 3: “Professional Waiter” should be on our resumes**\n\nI’ll be honest with you, writing this even only a day later I don’t remember some of what went down. We’ve had so many phone calls these past 24 hours that my brain is utterly fried.\n\nI’m sitting at *other airport* right now with *TurBoss* waiting for the FAA guys to show up. It’s 12:56, and they *were* due here at 13:00, but of course they called to inform us they’re running late.\nAt least they called.\n\nSo. Yesterday.\n\nTo be perfectly straight, yesterday wasn’t particularly interesting. It consisted mostly of driving, sitting in various parking lots for hours on end, and waiting for people to call us back.\nWe check out of the hotel in the morning, as this was before the FSDO informed us that they wanted to come out to look at the plane and our flight out of hell was scheduled for 17:00 that day. (Sorry for screwing up the timeline). We’re going back and forth with the FAA and *buyers*, which is very frustrating as the FAA rep never picks up the phone, but rather emails us back a minimum of an hour after we call. \n\nThere’s waiting. A lot of waiting, and a lot of Hulu. One of the *buyers* has already left to fly back home, and the remaining one has a flight scheduled as we don’t really need him anymore. \nWe pick up *buyer* to take him to the international airport since other *buyer* already returned their rental car, and pass 15 miles of stopped traffic on the other side of the interstate. The way we have to return. After we drop him off, we park in a nearby restaurant’s parking lot for ~an hour, and await another FAA phonecall. \n\nThe latest item of bullshit is that the *buyer* signed the 8130-6 with his name, but listed his LLC as the aircraft owner, so NOW the FAA wants proof that he’s actually a partner in the LLC. \nWell he’s on a plane now, so we can’t get anything from him. We call his office, explain the situation to the girl working, and how we need some sort of official document listing him as a partner, but she informs us that she can’t give that out. Several more phonecalls later, we get connected to somebody else associated with the business, and thankfully, *buyer* has been filling him in on the plane situation as the story developed. We get a document emailed to us, and email it to the FSDO a few minutes before they close.\n\nResigned to the reality that they won’t see or respond to the email until the following day, we place several more phonecalls, cancel our return flights, reserve two new rooms at the hotel we just checked out of, extend the car rental, and drive back to the hotel after ~2 hours of sitting in the car in a gas station parking lot, stopping to grab some carryout, and go to a drive-through beer warehouse. \n\nWe’ve drunk a lot on this trip, but I’ll be *goddamned* if anyone tries to tell me we don’t deserve it.\n\nFood. Beer. It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Typing part II of this tale. Replying to Reddit comments. Bed.\n\n**Day 4: Ugh**\n\nThank, GOD this last part is rather uneventful. We wake up, hang around the hotel until 12 when we have to check out, then drive to *other airport* to **finally** wait for the FAA reps to show up at 1. Why WOULDN’T we get a phonecall letting us know that they’ll be a half hour late? Really, why WOULDN’T everything that could go wrong continue to go wrong? \n\nThe half hour turns into an hour, and they finally arrive. Five ~~damn~~ **fucking** minutes later, they hand us the ferry permit and walk away happy. *TurBoss* and I high five, shake each other’s hands, and breath a massive sigh of relief that this ridiculous debacle is finally over.\n\nI left out a lot of details, as the story didn’t need explanations of *every* last phonecall and second we spent waiting around, but seriously guys.

        "text": "Hey guys, first official TFTS post!  \nLet me start by explaining that I work within a small events company that hires out space and computers for exams and other computer based training etc. A recent post in TFTS reminded me of this story that happened a few weeks ago.     \n  \n  \n\n  One evening after imaging ~30 PC's to be used for tomorrow's exam, I go to connect them up to our exam server. Surprise surprise, as soon as I patch into the core switch the network shuts down. Not the whole thing thankfully, but still it is the part that is vital to the exam....  \n  Ok weird, this worked last week, why is this happening now? Start again, plugging one cable at a time. I get to one particular CAT5 that leads to a particular room, plug it into the switch and bam. No network.  \nI think to myself, \"it couldn't be, no... not that simple\". I'm sure you could guess the problem that had me running around for 2 hours was.\n  \nThat's right, I had a loop. Someone (probably me, if I'm honest) had plugged a small 8 port switch into the wall, and then another cable coming out and back into the same darn switch.  \n\nTL;DR Overthinking a simple problem, wasted 2 hours by making a rookie mistake.",

        "text": "Man, this whole encounter has definitely had me confused for this whole entire day. It happened this morning, and even after going over it a couple of times I still don't know what the heck this guy was wanting.\n\nA little back story...\n\nI work first level tech support in a call center for a very large company, and help sales people to associates. I assist with all hardware and non-proprietary software issues, as well as password resets and most access issues.\n\nSo I get this call from a department manager. Since I can't remember what most of what I say right after I said it, some of the following will be paraphrased, but most of it is still correct.\n\nI will, of course, be $me, and the manager will be $manager.\n\n$Me: Thank you for calling tech support, my name is ovenproofcorgi, may I have your name and employee number?\n\n$Manager gives me his information. Generic pleasantries are exchanged.\n\n$Me: Thank you, $Manager, how can we help you today?\n\n$Manager: I'm having trouble with my computer password. I changed it last Monday, and then again on Friday, and my computer will only take my old password. And then when I went to change all my other passwords to make them all the same, those wouldn't work either.\n\nNote: Our company has several different passwords. There's the computer password for the majority of things, but then there are other passwords for accessing paychecks, as well as ones for logging into specific servers. I am able to reset computer/windows account passwords, but all the others he is referring to are done via a password reset site that the user themselves has to log into. Also, for security, we always advise our employees to have different passwords for all of their accounts. They of course don't listen.\n\n$Me: I'm sorry that's happened, and I'll be more than happy to assist you with that. Let me check some items here on my side to see what we can do for you.\n\nI check his windows account, and I see it was last changed on Monday of this week, five days ago. His account isn't locked, nor has the password been reset at all. The tool we have is basic, but does give us that amount of information.\n\n$Me: Okay, well, I can see here that your windows account is in good standing, and hasn't been reset since Monday. But you said you had to log into your workstation using your old password, correct?\n\n$Manager: Yes, and then when I tried to change my other passwords they wouldn't work either.\n\n$Me: Okay... Are you working in the office today, or are you working from home?\n\n$Manager: I'm in the office.\n\nI explain to him that sometimes what can happen, is if the password was changed, sometimes our systems don't recognize that it had been changed. I have seen this once in my over five years in my current position, but it has happened, so I don't second guess it at the moment. I ask the manager to restart his workstation, which he does (begrudgingly). Once he is back at the log in screen, I have him log back in with what he is telling me is his new/current password. He tells me it doesn't work. I ask him to then try logging in with his old password. He tells me it lets him log in. At this point I ask him if I can remote access his system. He obliges, I give my standard legal statements of don't have personal information up and I dig in.\n\n$Me: Okay, after looking over some things, I can't find a reason why your system isn't accepting your newest password. At this point, I think we will have to go ahead and reset it since it didn't take the last time.\n\nAgain, I *have* seen this before.\n\n$Manager: No, I don't want to reset my password again. Then I'll have too many passwords to remember and I don't want that.\n\nInternally I'm thinking... dude... it's two passwords! I have multiple accounts that I have to keep up with and change on a semi regular basis, including (but not limited to) three admin accounts, a couple of dispatch sites for order equipment, MY computer password, the password I use to check my paycheck, and several PINs. If I can remember my passwords, all varying lengths and complexities (up to 16 characters, letters, numbers, symbols, upper case, lower case, no sequences), you can remember your two passwords. Anywho...\n\nIt was at about this point that something finally clicked... When he was talking about when he reset his password he kept saying \"last Monday\" and \"Friday\". That seemed especially odd since I could clearly see that he last reset his windows password on *this* Monday, just five days ago.\n\n$Me: Manager, I have a quick question, when you say you reset your password last Monday, are you referring to Monday of this week?\n\n$Manager: Yes.\n\n*Imagine my face as I just stare straight ahead with a \"Are you kidding me\" face.*\n\n$Me: Manager, that isn't your old password, that's your current password. It hasn't been changed or reset since Monday.\n\n$Manager: Okay, well, I'm trying to change all my other passwords to make them the same and those new ones aren't working.\n\nI opened the password reset site and I have him log into it using his windows password... his \"old\" one, as he so frustratingly called it. I go straight to the password that he's trying to reset and I watch him as he changes it. He is doing everything correctly. But the password change for the paycheck site isn't working. It is telling him he can't use it because he's used it before.\n\n$Me: Okay, it didn't take that password because you've used it before. You'll need to come up with something different.\n\n$Manager: I don't want it to be different. I want it to be my new password. It's only taking my old password\n\n*Ding! He said NEW and OLD password...*\n\n$Me: I have a question, because I just want to clarify something. I'm going to repeat back the information you've given to me. You are able to log into both your computer and the paycheck site using the password that you have been referring to as your \"old\" (I actually used air quotes in real life... don't judge me!) password, correct?\n\n$Manager: Yes\n\n$Me, contemplating throwing my keyboard across the room: There is no need for you to change your passwords, you are not logging in with or accessing anything with an old password. You are using your current password. They have no been changed, nor reset, since the last time you changed them, which was on Monday of this week.\n\n$Manager: But I still can't get into everything.\n\n$Me: Then what were you trying to log into that wasn't working?\n\n$Manager: I don't know, I forgot\n\n$Me: . . .\n\n$Manager: This is taking too long. You've been absolutely no help\n\n\\*click\\*\n\nI stared at my computer screens for a good couple of minutes as I contemplated *how* I was going to notate the ticket in our ticketing system. I tried my best, hoping that when/if he called back, that hopefully the next person he spoke with would read it and be able to just, I don't know... figure out what in the hell he needed help with.\n\nI couldn't figure out if I was confused, annoyed, or frustrated. I wanted to help the guy, but it didn't seem like he could help himself. A couple hours after this, when I had a moment, I talked to my supervisor about it since I wanted to see if maybe I missed something during the conversation. She was just as confused as I was.",

        "text": "**Greetings and welcome to another temp tale! This is only a \"part 2\" in spirit because I didn't call the original part 1. Hey hindsight is 20/20 right? At any rate if you wanna read the first one, it can be found here**: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9g88c2/wait_i_need_to_save_my_icons/?st=jmmog1a6&amp;sh=03910652\n\nSpot the easter egg  obscure pop-culture reference for internet points!\n\nAnyways with an alarming decrease in the amount of alcohol currently at my disposal, let's trudge bravely onward!\n\nFirst let's set the characters:\n\n* $Kevin: Ah the illustrious Kevin! Not his real name of course, but a \n real Kevin nonetheless\n\n* $Me: The brave hero in this story - runs on coffee, beer, and an unbearable lightness of being in my inventory.\n\n* $AC: Account Manager - A simple man with too much to do, and the sender of AD account removal requests\n\n\nRecently I was \"promoted\" to asset management at $MSP which means I no longer have to deal with end users (Yay) but I'm responsible for all hardware repairs and computer issues with our agents. Normally, this shouldn't be a problem. You might say to yourself \"Well golly gee these people are tech support agents, they should be able to handle things themselves\", and that is where my dear reader, you would be wrong.\n\nMy desk provides technical assistance for $GovOrg and during the end of summer/beginning of fall we have a very high call volume and as such, we hire about 60 temps to help handle the case-load.\n\nNow $Kevin is a very special man. He's been around the block a few times and the path around the block has formed into a rut, but Kevin is a proud man who perseveres through the hurdles life throws at him. Hurdles like typing, sending email, or the immense challenge of filling out tickets. The third bit is what this story is all about.\n\nNow $MSP uses a ticketing system that is pretty easy to use with some procedures on how different tickets are supposed to be written up. Easy enough right? When a user calls in, the process is pretty straight-forward you document the issue with troubleshooting notes, and a resolution or escalation to another resolving group. The point of the ticketing system is to capture any and all notes about the incident prior to routing/resolving.\n\nWelllll $Kevin had a notepad. No, I don't mean the notepad application I mean the dude had a physical pen and paper. Kevin wrote everything on this notepad. He'd write out his bathroom breaks, his credentials for various systems (he left this notepad on his desk in the open at all times despite $AC getting after him about it multiple times), but the big kicker was he would write his entire tickets on this notepad and then type them into our ticketing system at a rate of 4 keystrokes per hour.\n\nIt was annoying for the $Leads and $SupportStaff, but it finally came to a head one day. $Kevin lost his notepad. Now the losing his notepad would have been bad enough with the sensitive information on it, but it also had all his tickets. Now, dear reader you might assume at this point that $Kevin would do the responsible thing and tell someone, but this wouldn't be much of a story if that happened. So what's a $Kevin sans notepad to do?\n\nWell we keep an eye on the call to ticket ratio, and if there's a significant discrepancy then $AC or AC'sBoss will get really interested in the agent with the discrepancy. Knowing this, $Kevin does what any sensible $Kevin would do in his shoes. He ~~goes to $AC and explains what happened~~ makes up the tickets based on his memory.\n\nSo he picked usernames and made up tickets to send out. Needless to say, it wasn't long before we had a ton of confused users calling about an email confirmation on tickets they didn't make and pissed off users who didn't get a ticket for their issue.\n\n$Kevin was immediately pulled into a meeting and not 15 minutes later I got an email to pull his workstations and revoke his AD credentials.\n\nit was the best email I've ever received. If it didn't contain sensitive info, I'd have it framed.\n\nTL;DR Temp agent at $MSP writes everything down with pen and paper instead of using our ticketing system and it backfires ~~horribly~~ hilariously.\n\nStay tuned for part 3: \"compute dont work\".\n\nHope you enjoyed, wear your seatbelt and don't eat rocks!\n\nEDIT: We found his notepad shortly after. It was in a bathroom stall on the toilet paper dispenser.",

        "text": "This is a story from about a year and a half ago. I had been telling it to a bunch of my IT friends and realized that you guys would probably appreciate a good laugh at my expense here too.\n\nI'm going to start off by saying that the network structure at my company isn't the best. I've improved on some of it, especially because of this story, but it could still use work that probably isn't in the budget.\n\nAbout a week before everything went downhill, my company had gotten a new copier in. It was hooked up and after a few days of testing, we decided that it would work, and that we would move it to its final resting place. For whatever reason, that last part had been done without me. But at least one of the people involved in it was tech-savvy enough that I trusted him to unplug wires and plug them in at a new location, so I shrugged and let them do it.\n\nThe next day I was in our secondary location when I got a call. The network seemed to have a bunch of issues. The network was running super slow, and they had already gone through the basics to troubleshoot everything (power cycling the servers and network devices). Everything was slow enough that it was enough of an emergency to drag me back to the main location so I could take a look at it. Of course, this all happened on a Friday before I was going to be out for the weekend, so I got in, repeated the basics to make sure it had been done properly, then started to monitor the situation.While monitoring, I poked around, and determined that the only changes that had been made to the network recently was the copier move. I immediately decided that the copier couldn't have been the issue. After all, it worked in its old location, there's no reason it would suddenly start throwing a fit in the new location. And well... I was right. Sorta.\n\nBy the time we determined that there was still an issue, it was time to leave, I would get in early on Monday and resume troubleshooting.\n\nMonday rolls around, and I'm there at 7AM.Throughout the day I replace most of our major networking equipment, i.e. the main router and switches, part of which involves me driving about an hour to pick up new ones. A new problem also pops up, of course. One of our more important computers is acting up. It's just sitting on the login screen, unable to log in. This goes on the backburner, because the network is more important. Eventually, 7PM rolls around, and I'm stumped. I can't see where the issue possibly is. I'm tired. I go home.\n\nThe next day, In a fit of frustration, I do what one of my coworkers (who had previously done tech work) has suggested. I change out the 10/100 switch the new copier is on with a proper gigabit switch. (And yes, we have a gigabit network, but my old boss loved saving money by not upgrading old equipment, and I had picked up on that habit when I took over.) At this point I'm desperate for any change that isn't rewiring the whole building. And of course, having done that... everything is fixed. I'm baffled, but whatever, everything works, I'm happy again.\n\nBut of course, there's still that problem with the one computer not logging in. I go over, hook it up in my office... and it boots up fine. I shrug and hook it up where it originally was again... right next to the new copier, hooking it up on the new switch.\n\nThe next day... the computer has stopped logging in again. Exact same behavior as before. And this is when I do the thing I should have done when the whole mess started. I look at the wires that are connected to the switch. I trace them... and I discover that in the course of moving the copier, someone had discovered that there was a loose ethernet cable on the floor, figured it was supposed to be plugged into something, and plugged it in. Only... it was a cable that had been left over from a previous device that had been moved away at some point, and the other end was already plugged into that same switch. \n\nI had a loop. I had a loop, and the old switch was so old that it didn't support the more modern network protocols to not cripple the rest of the network in the case of a loop. Changing to a newer switch had isolated the problem to the devices local to it.\n\nSo yeah, that old switch? Right into the trash. In fact, after all those days of stressing out, I went on a purge, replacing and throwing out any and all of the switches of that make we still had.\n\nBut yeah, I learned that day that I shouldn't blindly trust other people to know exactly what they are doing. Also, to not keep extra ethernet cables laying around, where someone can unknowingly create a loop.",

We had 2 IT groups, one in the US, and one in the UK. Now, we have a 3rd IT group based in India. This decision stemmed from the guys in the UK, and we had no decision making power here. Anyways, for the past 6+ years I've been with the company, I've always setup all North America user accounts, and the UK group would create accounts for the rest of the world. Now, *all* new user requests go to India. \n\n$U has a new employee starting, so a ticket is submitted with all the new user details. This is the very first time we got a new US user since the new India team went live, so I passed the ticket over to them for user setup. A couple days later I see the user account is still not setup, so I take a look at the ticket conversation history....\n\n&gt; $S : \"Hi, $U, before we create this user account, can you please confirm the spelling of the user's first name and surname?

No, we do not need the users fathers name, that's just weird.\n\nI ended up assigning the ticket back to myself and just taking care of everything. This new process going forward has already failed on our very first attempt.

The desktops had arrived and had windows and basic programs set up. I email the user in question, and ask what other software the users will need.\n\n\"They need $Programs which are web based shortcuts\" I of course am hesitant as Rule #1 starts to gnaw at my brain as I confirm \n\n\"When you say \"Web Based Shortcut\" you mean there is no installed software, it is just a web page with an icon on the desktop that opens in their web browser correct?\"\n\nThey say yes, which unfortunately I took be truth, In this case however Rule 1A was relevant, \"It may not be malicious or willful, but Rule 1 is always in effect.\"\n\nAt the time I was just going to push out the web shortcut via group policy and call it good, which takes much less time than installing software. \n\nI show up to the site with my team ready to get the desktops rolled out that day, everything is going smoothly and I ask for the URL's for the web shortcuts. After we get a few desktops deployed I get the link to the software, which is not a web shortcut at all but a exe that needs to be locally installed. To make matters worse the software needs a bit of configuration as well as opposed to just clicking next a bunch of times.  \n\nLuckily we ended up getting it installed but we only after running around to PCs we had already said were \"done\" and running back and forth clicking next on each window, plugging in settings etc. We ended up \"finishing\" the project (see edit) but after staying much later than planned and having to deal with rush hour traffic on the way home.\n \nedit: One of my techs called me out, we got it \"complete\" where our tech for the site (poor soul) had to finish up a few lingering items that we meant to get done. Sorry $Tech!\n\nLet this be a cautionary tale, never forget Rule #1 of tech support.\n\nAs others here have said \"Trust, but verify\" \n",

        "text": "Some years ago I was consulting as a network admin/project guru for a college.\n\nI had started there many years ago as a level 1 tech before going on to Sr Sys, then left for the corporate world.\n\nNow I'm back doing various projects and triage coverage for sysadmins.\n\n\nAll the admins/techs were in the same area with office or cubes in a building on the edge of the campus.   They current top sysadmin was  in an office right next to mine, and I saw him rush out the door just before noon.\n\nThinking nothing of it, I\"m still logged in working on a 365 admin process, when one of our professors walks in and asks me for help. \n\nTechnically, I'm not supposed to do any level 1 because it's outside my contract, but we all know that \"other duties as assigned\" has a way of intruding on reality.  \n\n-------------------\nMe&gt; Hi $Prof, what's up today\n\n$prof&gt;  Oh, hello JK, I couldn''t find anyone else in the building, can you help our presenter with some computer things?  He's due to hold his presentation in 10 minutes in the #conference1 room, down the hall.\n\nMe&gt;  Ok, just let me finish up here and I'll be over.  I check the COnfroom1 schedule, and see that my co-worker WHO JUST LEFT IN A BIG HURRY, was supposed to help this person due to previous arrangement, and that he apparently bailed. \n\nSo I skip over to the ConfRoom1 and realize that the presenter has an old PC with no HDMI out.   He's not in the room yet, so I go looking for long  VGA cable &amp; adapter for the projector, and when I return I am introduced to the presenter.\n\nHe's an old gentlemen who can hardly walk, can't speak above a whisper, and he's *TOTALLY BLIND*\n\nOur confroom  is NOT equipped for this at all,  and I am having trouble getting video out,, but finally manage it.\n\nHis PC  is ancient (XP) has special software on it that requires pressing the TAB key multiple times to hilite a screen area, and the computer then reads him out loud what that item is, so he can press the enter key to run that function..\n\nJust getting him through auth on guest wifi is a real PITA with that software for non sighted people.\n\nIt's obvious we now need a pair of speakers as Bluetooth isn't present, and no HDMI, so my next job is hunting a pair of PC speakers, which requires a trip across campus.\n\nFinally we think he's ready to go,, but then he asks how we will be RECORDING HIS SESSION so he can distribute that for his blog.\n\nMe&gt; sorry  $Mr Blind person, we don't have that capability with our current setup. ( Without HDMI, the white board could record video, but no audio) \n\nBottom line, he's not happy that we are so far behind the times with tech support, and complaints are made to Dean of the College.\n\nTL:DR&gt; Don't ever assume anything,  co-workers will bail on you with no consideration at all\n\n",

        "text": "**PART II**\n\n**Day 2: The shit-storm starts brewing (continued)**\n\nTo reiterate: we are here inspecting this aircraft and working on getting a “ferry permit” for it (FAA Form 8130-6) to allow the plane to go on a one-time flight despite overdue maintenance, so that we can fix everything at *our* shop.\n\nAs I said, the FSDO was NOT particularly happy with our assessment of this aircraft. Ultimately, the consequences of the decision to allow it to fly do fall to *TurBoss* and I, but this FSDO doesn’t seem happy with that. Our shop/repair station has the capabilities to do all of the things they’re unhappy with, but our shop is the one we’re trying to *get* it to, and nobody at this airport has any of the necessary (very expensive) equipment. Great.\n\nWell, we figure the least we can do is service the oxygen and nitrogen. It turns out, contrary to what we believed, there *is* a maintenance facility on base here at *unnamed airport*, so we decide to pop on over to see if we can pay them for some of their precious N2 and O2. They don’t seem the most thrilled, but they lend us their N2 bottle. The O2 they say is down at another hangar, and is regularly used to service the ~~perfectly fine~~ leaky ass oxygen bottle of that guys plane. We’re about to take the nitrogen, turn the regulator on just to ensure we have enough to get above the required ~2000 psi, and discover it is essentially empty.\nCool!\n\nMeanwhile, the guy whose hangar the oxygen is at returns from wherever he flew to. We drive down there, ask him about the oxygen, and he states that he has none, has the local shop service it, and recommends going down there. \n\nFuck this.\n\nWe inform *buyers* of what’s going on, and they find a local *gas store* to get our N2 and O2 from. Finally something is going ~~totally wrong~~ right. An hour or so later, *buyers* return with a bottle of nitrogen, and a bottle of oxygen. Welding oxygen. Now, gas isn’t super expensive, but when you’re buying a whole new canister, it’s not that cheap either. Taking advantage of *buyers* naivety, or simply not knowing enough about it himself, the *gas store* employee sold them the welding oxygen, uncaring or unaware to the fact that aviation grade oxygen is its own very special thing. Thankfully, we’re able to charge up the nitrogen, however we’re still SOL on oxygen.\n\nWe decide to return to the hangar where the oxygen is *supposedly* stored and see for ourselves if it’s there or not. Thankfully, the door is unlocked, however as soon as we open it, the alarm system the hangar **apparently** has starts beeping, so we immediately leave and go back to the local shop. They give us the key and alarm code, and we go commandeer an oxygen bottle, and after an hour of more bullshit, finally get it fully serviced.\n\nProblems solved, right. Nah....\n\nWe go back to the hotel and spend hours getting and filling out the paperwork. The hotel computers won’t let us access the FAA’s website to get the forms, but eventually we get them and send them to the FSDO. \n\nThis dude is *still* not having it. First off, he doesn’t answer his phone. We’ll call him, and he won’t ever call back, but a long time later he’ll email us. He’s still very iffy on giving us the ferry permit, so we call *bossman* to see what he can do. He calls OUR FSDO, has them talk to *this* FSDO, and eventually calls this FSDO himself. In an absolutely unprecedented sequence of events, *bossman* gets on a conference call with not one, but FOUR *feds* with the FSDO here. They continuously try to offer explanations for why they can’t grant the ferry permit, but *bossman*, with his decades of aviation experience and familiarity with the FAA regs, shoots down all of them. \n\nNow the FSDO wants their OWN mechanic to come out and check out the plane and the logbooks to ensure what FAA certified A&amp;P (airframe and powerplant- the certification for aircraft mechanics) *turBoss* is true.\n\nThat brings us to today. September 27th.\nPart 3 coming soon.\n\n\nSorry for formatting and grammar- I’m in the midst of drinking to forget these problems, and I’m not sure how many I’ve had. \n\nEdit: [Part I in case you missed it](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9jgu0z/welcome_to_hell_the_unfortunate_travels_of_an/?st=JMLY81KT&amp;sh=83fb105e) \n\n\nEdit: reiterated what we’re doing and what a ferry permit is. \n\nEdit Edit Edit:\n[Part III](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9jt96z/welcome_to_hell_part_iii/?st=JMMUEZBU&amp;sh=f045c8b5) ",

I am happy to say I can FINALLY, 6 months after college, call myself a tech and not a retail employee trying to escape from  $sparkmart.  I'm on mobile so obvious apologies for formatting editing spelling and all that jazz.  \n  \nI have posted a few small stories in the past this one is one of those ones that when it's over you just feel so stupid.  I just started 4 days ago to work for a small sales and service shop where I live in small-town usa.  Today I was working on a laptop that couldn't connect to Wi-Fi.  Now I was working on other projects at the same time as the boss/owner wants.  I plugged it in turned it on and verified what was going on. Wi-Fi was off, so was airplane mode.  I looked over the case for a WiFi switch but didn't see one.  Here's the highlights of the next 3 hours: airplane mode on then off, network settings turned on wifi it went off immediately, updated drivers, ran sfc, chkdsk nothing worked. Finally, half hour before close I employ the boss's help.  He looks at it does many of the same stuff he asked if I checked for a switch and I said yes. He's looking at it to see how easily the the bottom plate comes off and then he says \"what's this?\" And folks, my heart sank into my shoes.  There it was, really tiny, like less than half an inch, the same for as the case save for a tiny white dot in the middle, on the front edge of the case right below the touchpad: a WiFi switch!  I spent the next 5 mins trying to defend myself and feeling like a total idiot.",

Did they think they would order twelve thousand PCs and none of them would come equipped with the most basic not-even-a-peripheral?\n\nAnd what the fsk am I supposed to do with them, make a mat and curl up under it to die? Sounds tempting right about now.\n\nAnd I'm all out of coffee.",

        "text": "Hey all! To preface this, I was inspired by u/Zeewulfeh ‘s TFTS stories about his experiences as an aircraft mechanic. I’m also an aircraft mechanic, and wanted to share some stories of my own, however I didn’t think I had many worthy of dedicating a whole story to. Today that has changed! I’m writing this still in the midst of the hell of a shit-storm we’re in. \n\nLet’s begin.\n\n**PART I**\n\nCharacters in this story:\n\n*Crympt*: Yours truly\n\n*TurBoss*: Our shop’s turbine manager, and my coworker with me on this adventure\n\n*Buyers*: The two people buying this airplane\n\n*Seller*: The guy selling this airplane\n\n*Bossman*: The owner of our shop\n\n*The Feds*: The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) representatives\n\nHere goes:\n\nI don’t even want to type this out because I’m so sick of even thinking about this bullshit, and I’m so mentally dead, but perhaps having people laughing with me at my suffering will help. \n\n**Day 1: Welcome to hell**\n\nOur company was tasked with traveling out of state to perform a pre-buy inspection on a Citation (small business jet). Right off the bat SHTF. *Turboss* and I depart *airport*, arrive at *other airport* for a connecting flight, and then find out our flight has been delayed. No big deal. I have unlimited data so I’ll spend the time watching Hulu.\n\nOur flight gets delayed again.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.^andagainandagainandagain\n\nFinally they go ahead and cancel it, at which point we decide simply to change our rental car reservation and drive to our destination, as it’s only two hours away. During the whole drive we monitor what *would* have been our replacement flight, and see that get delayed and delayed, and finally cancelled at 9:30. Score. We made the right choice by driving. We check into the hotel, have a few beers, and go to bed, eagerly awaiting the easy money that is our few hours of work the next morning. \n\n**Day 2: The shit-storm starts brewing**\n\nAs expected, our inspections go off without a hitch. *TurBoss* and I meet *buyers* and *seller* at the hangar. We unload our tools and get to work performing our inspections. The airplane looks great. Sure it has 3 years of maintenance due, but from the few things we checked, it seemed to be in good enough shape to get the ferry permit to our shop. (A ferry permit is a one-time authorization from your local FSDO ((Flight Standards District Office)) to fly the aircraft to a location where whatever due/overdue maintenance can be performed)\n\nWe finish up in about 3 hours, then send off the FAA Form 8130-6 (for the permit) to the FSDO. *The Feds* **aren’t** happy with us.\n\nThey call and complain about several items. Uncertified transponders, uncertified airspeed indicators and altimeters, empty oxygen bottle (for emergency air), empty nitrogen bottle (to force the landing gear down if it doesn’t work for some reason). \nWe don’t have the capabilities at *this* airport to resolve any of those issues, however we should be able to get a ferry permit regardless. This is an unusual experience for us, as back at home it takes a phonecall and 10 minutes to get a permit. Little did we know, that the shit-winds had JUST started blowing. Our problems hadn’t even started.\n\nEdit: [Part II is here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9jjcsy/welcome_to_hell_part_ii/?st=JMLF9938&amp;sh=2fd5056b) ",

        "text": "A little bit of background before I start, we're an off-shore technical support representative for a telecommunications company. We specialize in telephone service difficulties such as having no dial tone, unable to receive incoming calls or the inability to make outgoing calls.\n\nAlex and I worked graveyard shifts but our clients are only two or three hours ahead of time so technically speaking, when we're working, most of our customers are deep in slumber, suffering in insomnia because they don't have a phone service, horny, and/or drunk. I won't go into detail as to how many horny customer calls I've received, I will however, tell you the story of Alex, my teammate.\n\nAlex is a great coworker. You can't ask for anything better. Since we don't have that many calls during our shifts, he would entertain us with his stories, however, something more entertaining than listening to his adventures was also listening to his calls. English is not our first language and sometimes, what we want to convey doesn't come out *exactly* correct. One time, he even asked a caller, \"Do you know your name?\", but this story is the most uncomfortable of all.\n\nOne boring night, Alex receives a granny call. This elderly woman asks for a wake-up call because she needs to catch a bus early in the morning. We don't technically cater wake-up calls, but Alex, being the gentleman that he is, asks a couple of questions first before giving in to this lovely grandma's request.\n\n**Alex:** I'm sorry, ma'am, we do not do wake-up calls. \n\n**Grandma:**: Son, I really need you to do this for me. I don't have a cellphone or an alarm and I really need to catch that bus.\n\n**Alex:** As much as I really want to, we're not allowed to do outbound calls. Do you not have anyone in your life to wake you up?\n\n*(silence)*\n\n**Grandma:** No.\n\n**Alex:** You don't have any loved ones to wake you up?\n\n*(silence)*\n\n**Alex:** Because ma'am, you can ask any of your loved ones to wake you up. Are you living alone?\n\n**Grandma**: (sounding sad) Yes, I live alone.\n\n**Alex:** (still perky as hell) Ahhhh, you don't have any loved ones.\n\n**Grandma:** (starts bawling) Why do you keep on insinuating that? Yes, I live alone! Yes! My children forgot about me and yes! If I don't wake up in the morning and die, nobody will notice! Is that what you want to hear?!!\n\nAround this time, Alex starts to panic. \n\n**Alex:** Ma'am, that's not what I was trying to say. I was just asking if you don't have any loved ones there to wake you up. That's all. I'm not insinuating anything, ma'am.\n\n**Grandma:** I was only asking for a wake-up call! I didn't call to get insulted! I expect that from my children, but not from a stranger like you! You don't know me!\n\n**Alex:** Okay, ma'am. Calm down. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you. Okay, I'll escalate this to my subject matter expert and request for an outbound tomorrow morning so that we can give you a wake-up call. Please, ma'am. I didn't mean to offend.\n\n**Grandma:** No! I don't want you doing me any favors because of pity! To hell with you! (hangs up)\n\nAfter that call, Alex starts to run around the production floor, looking for someone who he can escalate the situation to. After a couple of days, we had a call-listening session and calls were picked randomly. Unfortunately for Alex, that call was chosen. We were all quiet during the call listening session but Alex was the most uncomfortable of all.\n\nHe saved her details and  tried calling back the customer to wake her up but nobody was picking up the phone. To this day, Alex is still filled with guilt and starts to panic whenever he receives a granny call in the middle of the night.",

The convo then goes as follow\n\nMe: Can you ask one of your coworkers to help you?\nClient: No!\n\nOk so I assume theyre all busy. So I decided to remote to their computer to verify the drivers and devices. (Yes even if the mouse itself is broken you can control the cursor from remote). Before remoting though we need a specific tag.\n\nMe: In that case may I please get the pc tag so i can connect remotely and verify something?\nClient: I dont have my glasses let me get one of my coworkers to read it for me\n\n.... are you fucking kidding me?\n\nSo I then try to connect and tell the client to press enter so that the pop up asking if they want to allow me connect can be accepted.\n\nClient: I cant see anything the screens are flashing!!!!!\nMe: Did that start just now?\nClient: Yes!!\nMe: Ok can you get your coworker who read the tag for you to verify if everything is properly plugged in?

Cant you just send a tech here?!\nMe: I will send a tech if we do the basic troubleshooting and the issues are continuing ok? Please try rebooting your computer.\n\nI prayed to god that fixed their issue even though I knew it would very likely not.\n\nAfter rebooting is done.\n\nClient: The screens are still flashing!!!\nMe: Ok before I send a tech down please have a co worker help you with all the cable connections.\nClient: Just send a tech down!\n\nAnd then they hung up...\n\nTldr; Client's mouse problem turned into a monitor and mouse problem because they did not want to cooperate.\n\nThe pay is worth it though and most the clients we get are super sweet people.",

I proceeded to her work station and inquired as to what was troubling her productivity. \"Well the new EHR we are supposed to use...it was here the other day and now it's gone.\" No problem, probably just changed profiles and needs a new shortcut. \"Sure\", I said, \"this will only take a minute.\"\n\nI opened C:/ to navigate to the install path only to find...no folder. Strange, it must be in x86 by mistake....nothing. Someone probably installed it to the admin desktop or something...nope. A glance to Programs and Features; nothing...but....what is this? One of the separate components that is required to run it still shows as installed? Strange, it most definitely existed here at some point.\n\nI find myself now immersed in log files scanning for any source of foul play or tom foolery. For now the culprit is at large; but I will find them. I *will* find them.",

        "text": "Hi TFTS!\n\nLTL, FTP (heh)\n\n___\n\nI'm a systems engineer with a heavy hand in 2nd/3rd tier support. I have to interact with people a lot, especially when there are some data issues (I'm one of the database specialists).\n\nWe require our clients to regularly upload data files to our FTP server. One of our long-time clients' data started failing, and we got in contact with them. Now, we try to avoid uploading the data ourselves for them for various ^^read: ^^legal reasons, but we often get sent the files in an email to upload - which we subsequently have to turn down.\n\nCue my conversation with their technical manager.  \nAs these were spread across multiple nicely formatted emails, I'll paraphrase a bit for easier reading.\n\n&gt; **$me:**  Hi $mgr, it seems like the data you send us is incorrectly formatted. Could you please take a look?  \n\n&gt; **$mgr:** Hi, I've attached the files to this email. Could you please upload them?  \n\n&gt; **$me:** I'm sorry, but we do not upload files ourselves. Could you please push them to the FTP server?  \n\n&gt; **$mgr:** Could you give me the address for it?  \n\nNow this is strange, they should have these saved as we're receiving data every day. Whatever, we've dealt with them before and they're always nice, so since we don't store their logon info I quickly create a new user for him and set it to expire in a few hours.\n\n&gt; **$me:** Here are the `$ftp_details`, you should be able to connect with these.  \n\n&gt; **$mgr:** No, I meant what's the email address for it?\n\nOh boy.\n\n&gt; **$me:** There's no email address for it. You push the files to a remote location, and we read them from there.\n  \n&gt; **$mgr:** Oh, I thought that we just sent the csv files to a special ftp email address and you picked them up. I guess I'm wrong then?\n\nHe was really cool and polite with the whole thing so I'm more surprised than anything. But this explained a lot; this is the guy who asks us to upload a summary file at the end of _every_ month, we have to turn him down each time and he complains that it should be easier.\n\nNow, it's perfectly fine to not know how FTP works. But I'm not sure how someone becomes the manager of the technical department without knowing the difference between an email address and an FTP server. ",

        "text": "Another tale from my days working for $GiantSupermarketChain on their helpdesk.\n\nYour cast of characters:\n\n**$Miscreancy**: A dashing ne'er-do-well, now in $sysadmin team for the company after a year or so on the helpdesk. Still had to answer the phones though...\n\n  \n**$Hagrid:** My boss on this team - friendly, approachable and very much had my back at any given point, as you'll see later on.\n\n  \n**$Dumbledore:** My whole department's boss. Widely respected. Slightly feared. Extremely fierce in defence of his employees.\n\n  \n**$GodricGryffindor:** Director for the area of the business I worked for. Didn't know the guy but he turned out to be pretty solid on this occasion.  \n\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** Worked for $Contractor who helped service a particular type of machine over in another city. Dealt with users directly, but had 0 ability to access any of the admin infrastructure, which meant me getting involved for account issues.  \n\n\nAuthor's note: $HeWhoMustNotBeNamed will, in fact, be named later, but the name he provided I have switched out for a different one, just to ensure anonymity as best as possible. I promise this note will make more sense later - and the name he provided was every bit as ridiculous as the one below!\n\n  \nThe tale begins!\n\n*So this was while I was manning the help desk for $GiantSupermarketChain - now moved into more of a 1st line Sysadmin role, provisioning accounts, fulfilling access requests, groups and suchlike. It was a great job but my gosh the workload was hectic, and I could find myself smashing out 2-300 requests in an 8 hour shift. Requests ranged from the simple, 30 second script run type to the full-on, it takes half an hour type. And those were just the ones coming in via email, the phone calls were, invariably, worse, if it wasn't a simple issue.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*ringeth the phone\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$Miscreancy:** Hi, you're through to $Miscreancy in $Sysadmin team at $GiantSupermarketChain - how can I help?\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** Hello, I'm calling from $contractor - I have a user here with some account issues.\n\n**$Miscreancy:** Okay - can you describe some of the issues for me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed then walks through some issues logging into a machine with $fruitOS. I know right off the bat what the issue is, which is that they need to log into a machine with $SeeThroughOS first before being able to log into $fruitOS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$Miscreancy:** Okay, so the issue is that the user needs to log into a $SeeThroughOS machine and do an initial setup before $fruitOS will work.\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** \\*doesn't pause to ask the user if they've done this\\* The user has already done this\n\n**$Miscreancy:** Are you sure?\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** \\*still doesn't ask\\* Yeah, definitely.\n\n**$Miscreancy:** Okay... I'm going to check the data in $CommonDirectoryService and just check the relevant flags show that's the case. Just hold on for two minutes for me.\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** \\*spoken away from the phone, clearly under the impression I can't hear him and directed at the user he's helping\\* I'm sorry this is taking so long, the person at the other end of the phone is absolutely useless.\n\n**$Miscreancy:** ... \\*ahem\\* you do know I can hear you, don't you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA panicked silence breaks out on the other end of the phone. I'm running through $CommonDirectoryService checking stuff and sure enough, the configuration of the user profile shows first login hasn't been completed, so $fruitOS has no chance of working yet.\n\n  \n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** I thought I was on hold? Anyway, I'm sorry if I've offended you, but you're not really helping, you're making me wait while you check things unnecessarily when you should be doing your job and getting the user working, which is what I'm trying to do.\n\n**$Miscreancy:** Did you actually ask the user if they'd completed first login into $SeeThroughOS?\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** It doesn't matter whether they have or not, that question is pointless.\n\n**$Miscreancy:** And I'm telling you that the only way to get $fruitOS working is to hand the user a spare $SeeThroughOS machine, have them complete first login on that, and then restart the $fruitOS machine and try again. You have no business talking to me or about me that way, especially not to a user. What's your name?\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** Errrrrr.... Harry.\n\n**$Miscreany:** Harry what?\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** Harry Potter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA beat of silence passes. I know he's just lied to me. He knows I know he's just lied to me. The question is, will he get away with it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**$Miscreancy:** Alright... Harry. Like I said, follow those steps with a $SeeThroughOS machine and your user will be up and running within 5 minutes. Anything else?\n\n**$HeWhoMustNotBeNamed:** ... No.\n\n**$Miscreancy:** Okay. Have a good day.\n\n\\*end call\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm in two minds about what to do here. I could shrug and pass it off as an idiot abroad, which is what I would ordinarily do. On the phones people are rude, these things happen, that's... not okay but it happens and most of the time I wouldn't raise a fuss, I'd just crack on with my day, especially as I was in the right. But giving a fake name is an extra layer of aggravation that has really naffed me off, and the fact that he directed the comments at the user I was trying to help also didn't help. So, knowing that the call recording would show all of this, I pinged an email to $Hagrid:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Hi $Hagrid,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Not a huge deal, but could you take a look at the recording of the call I just had? The guy was extremely rude, had no idea what he was doing, and was personally insulting to boot. Not a good combination!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Not looking for anything major but someone should probably have a word with him.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Miscreancy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I was genuinely not expecting what happened next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll spare you the interminable email chains that ensued, but here's a rough flow:\n\n\\&gt; $Hagrid reads mail, listens to recording, and gets absolutely fuming. $Hagrid then emails me back telling me that he's absolutely fuming, and is going to pass the recording on to his boss $Dumbledore to see if anything can be done.\n\n\\&gt; $Dumbledore gets the recording and the email, listens to it and is also absolutely fuming. He emails $Hagrid and I telling us that what happened was absolutely unacceptable, especially from a contractor, and that he would be passing it on to $GodricGryffindor to pass on to $Contractor.\n\n\\&gt; $GodricGryffindor gets the recording, listens to it, and emails me to apologise for the way that $HeWhoMustNotBeNamed behaved. He then passes this on to someone very high up in $Contractor and cc's me in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, one of $Contractor's guys get back to us and tell us that $HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has been terminated effective immediately - not because of what they said as much as for the fact that when confronted with it, they then lied about their identity, giving a ridiculous false name. Also because they were being given the correct information but decided that because it didn't match something they'd encountered before, it was clearly wrong. Particularly bad when this was $HeWhoMustNotBeNamed's first day working on behalf of $GiantSupermarketChain - amazing that this person thought in the couple of hours on this contract they'd sussed out how all of our systems worked and interacted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Tl;dr: those warning messages that tell you something's being recorded genuinely mean you're being recorded. Also don't give a fake name, it never works, and may get you fired.**",

The first alarm should have been that they were wrapped in big contractor trash bags and taped closed.\n\n I get one up to the counter and cut the bag open and I’m immediately greeted with a moldy stench of water damage and cigarettes.

This is where they inform me the relative was a bit of a hoarder. I grit my teeth and open the other bag but instead of water and cancer smoke it’s absolutely filthy and every crevice has a fine orange line of old garbage food waste in it. The bag has the most disgusting keyboard inside which I refused to touch and excuse myself while I get a fume mask and some thick gloves and begin getting to work. \n\nThe man from the couple verbally disagrees with me donning protective gear and says I’m insulting them by saying it’s so filthy I need a full mask to deal with it but I ignore them and get to work seeing if they even turn on witch surprises me because they both do. \n\nI had plastic sheets covering the work surface and they remained as much in their plastic bags as possible and I spent the rest of the day transferring everything to a drive and then removing all critical pieces to be destroyed. \n\nEverything else is tossed into 3 garbage bags layered together and the drive is given to the customers with the offer for the remainder of the parts which they declined. \n\nDealing with gross equipment is a normal thing in the computer repair business but sometimes something comes through which honestly makes you consider quitting.

        "text": "TLDR: User threw router out, then plugged the new router we sent into the wrong sockets, then reset the new router.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGo grab a fresh coffee cause this is a long one.\n\n1st line helldesk tech, 40 sites, 250 users, 40 servers and 2 IT, both 1st line, one with 2 years experience (me), the other 1 year. Did somebody say blind leading the blind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe recently started to bring an acquired company in line with our IT standards, many, many things went wrong with this process but I shall start with one of my favourites.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have owned this company for maybe 4 months and in that time we have slowly set about getting them on track with our software and practices.\n\nOne of the last things we did was supply them with a new modem/router, this was a big deal for us as we would finally be able to get them linked back to our HQ through our VPNs the same way that every other branch in the company worked, file shares, get remote access for support, print servers, all the good stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis particular site was 350-400 miles away, so everything was being done remotely, i.e. Take pictures of the router and do a 20 page step by step on how to connect it up, on the phone telling them to unplug this cable from the old router and plug in the new one. We already had a picture of their old router, so it was even easier, unplug the cable from the red port on the old router and plug it into the yellow port on the new one.\n\nThe kind of thing that if these people were in their own home would manage without breaking a mental sweat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe sent the router down to the site and asked them to give us a call if anything didn't make sense, anything didn't work properly, or even if they just wanted IT to 'hold their hand' through the process.\n\nWe waited a week before we wondered if everything had gone smoothly or not, so we called them up and were promptly told that 'The Internet' wasn't working and hadn't been working for 2 days.\n\nI about fell off my chair when I heard this, my morning coffee now adorning my monitors, desk and most of my internal organs after the coughing fit died down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out this site had 2 internet connections, one for PCs and the other for the IP phones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after getting pictures for our how-to guide, someone on site thought it was weird and untidy that they had 2 modems. So they unplugged one and threw it out, this shall be FU No.1. This was 'fine' as they moved the network cables to the other router, and everything worked, but they did say that it had been a bit slow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that they had tossed the 'PC' router and plugged everything into the 'phone' one. The 'PC' internet was 80mbps FTTC whilst the 'phone' one was only 4mbps ADSL. I sit back as the problem is now apparent, we provisioned the router for the 80mb connection, so the logins and other details were all wrong. My heart rate is now falling back down from 'dangerous' to 'fast'. \n\nI ask if they can move the cable over to the other ISP's port on the wall as this will get them onto the right connection and get them back up and running. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd here everything starts working and Plutian goes and gets a fresh cup of coffee...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe connection never came up, fantastic! We go through the basics: Is it turned on, is the power cable actually plugged in, do you see flashing lights on the front, is the internet cable plugged in properly? Ticks across the board, at this point I can add a line fault cherry to the top of my internet misery cake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is where FU No.3 happens. I'll get back to No.2\n\nAfter what felt like a week but was only the next morning, we manage to get an engineer to go out to site to test the line.\n\nHe confirms that the line is fine, and the site is back up and running.\n\nGreat! Fantastic! Wait... the router isn't phoning home, the VPN isn't linked. I ping the site, Nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI get on the phone to the site and the conversation goes a little like this.\n\n**Me**: Hi, the engineer just called saying that you're up and running.\n\n**User**: Yeah the internet is working, but the phones aren't and we don't have access to the shared drives or anything, and the printer isn't working.\n\n**Me**: What did the engineer do?\n\n**User**: He put in the login stuff, and it worked straight away.\n\n**Me**: He put in the login stuff? What stuff?\n\n**User**: The internet ones. \n\n**Me**: What on the router?\n\n**User**: Yeah, the internet credential things\n\n*My spidey sense are tingling now.*\n\n**Me**: How did he get on to the router?\n\n*I have an almighty sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach.*\n\n**User**: He reset it.\n\n*This is where my second cup of coffee in as many days is nearly lost, and my spidey senses are going mental. All the little pieces fall into place. I ping the IP of the 'phone' connection:...  success.*\n\n**Me**: Let me call you back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis goes back to FU No.2. \n\nWhen the site was asked to swap the cable to the other socket, they got confused. For some unknown reason they moved the RJ11 from the new router back to the old router, which had no power and nothing else plugged into it. After that didn't work they unplugged the cable again and plugged it back into the new router, just in case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe engineer has then gone in, factory reset the router, and entered the 'correct' login details, which are for the 'phone' internet connection.\n\nThe site specific internal IP's are gone, the printer and phones are on a site specific IP so they don't work, the VPN credentials had been wiped so it wasn't working, and the site were running on a 4mbps connection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took 4 days of remote work to try and get them back up and running on the 80mb fibre line, which didn't work, followed by a site visit which involved an overnight stay and approximately 10 minutes to swap the cable to the correct port and restore the router from the backup we took just before sending it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really goes to prove the saying \" I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this to you.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

No special cooling, power, or anything else you’d expect.\n\nThe hosting company website advertised that all of its datacenters were like US2 - modern state of the art facilities with multiple redundant systems in place in the event of failure.\n\nI walked into work one morning and noticed a lot of commotion.   I didn’t think much of it since it tended to be a hectic work environment. \n\nI sat down at an open workstation and entered my login credentials.   I kept getting login errors.\n\n**Me:** Hey, I can’t login to AD, is anything going on?\n\n\n**Coworker:** Oh, you didn’t hear?   A construction crew using a backhoe severed all of our fiber lines at US1.  The entire datacenter is offline.  \n\n**Me:** Holy shit!\n\n**Coworker:** Yeah, we are trying to figure out what to do.\n\nLooking around, it quickly became evident to me that management had no idea what to do.  They simply had no contingency plan for this type of event. \n\nMeanwhile, calls from angry customers with services hosted at US1 were flooding the support center. \n\n“Our company email is down.”\n\n“Our corporate site is down.”\n\n“We were in the midst of a demo for a big prospect and our site is no longer accessible.”\n\n“Your claims about redundant links are full of shit and we’re going to sue you.”\n\nInternally, a bunch of ideas were being tossed around since no one knew how long it would take for the connection to be restored.\n\nDue to the severity of the cut, the repair crews determined they couldn’t repair the lines and had to run new ones. \n\nIt was decided to move all the servers from US1 to US2.   This was no small feat because in addition to physically moving them we also had to reassign static IP addresses because the subnets were different. \n\nWe were working through these migrations well into the evening when the connectivity was restored. \n\nLast I heard they were able to recoup some money from the company that was responsible for the fiber cut.\n\nIt was a total shitshow, and I genuinely felt sorry for the affected customers that day.

        "text": "[**NOTE:**  TftS-SAVC #1 is located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7x8av3/tales_from_the_scottishsounding_anti_virus/), #2 is located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/9e2kqi/tales_from_the_scottishsounding_antivirus_company/).  AG]\n\n#Dramatis Personae\n`$Customer` - *the customer at the other end of the phone line*  \n`$Me` - *as well, me, /u/goretsky*  \n`$TheBoss` - *the founder of the Scottish-Sounding Antivirus Company* (not present when this happened, but hey, he's `$TheBoss`)\n\n#Prelude\nThis is another call I took on the Dark Avenger virus which originated in Bulgaria, much like in the previous post.  The `$Customer` was not a technical user, but was interested enough in the virus to do some homework.  `$TheBoss` does not make an appearance, as he was out in his RV meditating at the time of the call.\n\n#The Call\nThis is another call I took back in 1989, when I was doing technical support for the  Scottish-Sounding Antivirus Company out of `$TheBoss` home at his kitchen table.\n\nThe call from a customer who was also some place in the United States.  The customer's computer was infected with a virus which we called the [Dark Avenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Avenger) virus (also called the Eddie virus by some other anti-virus programs).  Like many computer viruses of that era, it was a parasitic file infector and it increased the size of infected files by 1,800 bytes, because that was how large its code was.  One thing that was notable about this particular computer virus is that the author mentioned inside the virus code that it had been written in Sofia, Bulgaria.  In those days, Internet access was uncommon and expensive, so that meant that viruses spread themselves slowly through methods such as file downloads from BBSes and mailed floppy disks.  Getting a virus-infected program from half-way around the world was about as notable as getting a physical letter in the mail from there; it simply did not happen that often for most people.\n\nI told the customer what we knew about the virus, gave them instructions on how to download our software to clean things up from our BBS, and then call me back if there were any further questions or they needed help running the cleaner.\n\nAbout an hour later I got a call back from the customer.  They had looked up [Sofia, Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia) in an encyclopedia (no Wikipedia back then, and web sites were still a few years out) and found out that the city was 1,800 feet (550m) above sea level. \n\nThey wanted to know if this was related to the increase in file size from the Dark Avenger virus code.\n\nI had to explain that, no, it was just a coincidence.  And odd one, to be certain, but that's all it was.\n\n#Moral of the story\nCustomers may not always be technical, but they often have an internal consistency that is logical to them.  In this case, the customer's desire to achieve some kind of understanding of a computer was strong enough that they did some research and found a pattern that matched a value.  Unfortunately it was not a particularly useful piece of data, and it was just happenstance that the size of a computer virus and the altitude of the city in which it was written had the same numeric value.\n\nRegards,\n\nAryeh Goretsky",

        "text": "**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**$Selben:** Me! “Technical Team Lead” previously Tier II ~~helldesk~~ helpdesk technician for a mid-sized company with a very skeleton-crew helpdesk. There were 10 of us total providing 24-hour coverage (not including supervisors) for 2500+ people company-wide.\n\n**$Snickers:** My cubicle mate, also a “Technical Team Lead.”\n\n**$BadIntern:** Intern2, still in college - got in due to a mistake. Previously called $Baddi, but name changed for clarification.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Some of you may recognize parts of this tale, and that would be because it is an unplanned continuation of “The Goodi the Baddi and the Nauti.” Additional information was recently provided while reminiscing with ~~$Snickers~~ an unconfirmed source.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$Snickers was checking his email and going through the normal office memos (meeting tomorrow, the ketchup needs to be refilled in the breakroom, a reminder to not take lunch meeting food with someone else’s name on it, set up a conference room next week for a video conference, etc), when $BadIntern returned to their shared cubicle. Having been missing at least an hour, $BadIntern tried to creep in, but $Snickers could see his reflection on his monitor. As $Snickers turned in his chair towards him, $BadIntern quickly put his hands in his unprofessionally baggy pants pockets, acting like he’d been there the entire time. $Snickers patience had begun to severely wear thin several days ago, when $BadIntern was re-assigned to his cubicle after repeatedly telling a female co-worker how nice she smelled (and other uncomfortable things).\n\n&amp;nbsp;                       \n\n&gt; $Snickers: Please, whatever you’re doing, just stop. Sit down.\n\n$BadIntern thunked down into his chair.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n$Snickers returned to his work. Within a few seconds, $BadIntern was playing with a wireless mouse. With a crack and a pop, a piece of plastic mouse shrapnel hit $Snickers in the back of his head. He spun around.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; $Snickers: STOP doing that!\n\n$BadIntern had a look of confusion and shrugged. $Snickers rolled his eyes and glared.\n\n&gt; $BadIntern: Huh?\n\n&gt; $Snickers: Just… Stop…\n\nThis is where $Selben, temporarily in a cubicle nearby, observed $BadIntern choosing to do what any rational person would do in that situation, and threw the broken mouse over the cubicle wall. Fortunately, no other victims were hit.\n\nA few days later, $Snickers was working and heard $BadIntern plop down in the chair behind him several hours later than normal. His heightened sense of smell insisted he inspect the situation as opposed to ignoring $BadIntern as much as possible. He slowly turned to see $BadIntern attempting to secretly eat a hoagie—the hoagie was half hiding in his sleeve—he froze upon being spotted. $Snicker’s stomach rumbled in response, but he ignored it and turned back to continue working. After a few minutes his senses were again hit with a similar, yet different overwhelming smell, and turned to see $BadIntern eating another hoagie, from his other shirt sleeve. $Snickers noted this one had bell peppers and onions and was definitely a different sandwich. Before he could begin his questioning, he was distracted by a call.\n\nBy the time the call was over (a branch lost email access…their internet was down), $BadIntern had disappeared yet again, leaving $Snickers slightly confused and a bit suspicious.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe next day $Snickers was on a break and chatting with $Selben while $BadIntern had been shuffled off to “work” with $Selben. He was playing with some ~~tweezers~~ zip ties and kept getting his fingers stuck. Suddenly $BadIntern looked up at what $Selben was doing and shouted out like a young child.\n\n&gt; $BadIntern: OOOH! You’re playing video games at work! They said you can’t do that!\n\n$Snickers paused and looked around. $Selben clearly had work on his machine. He had a website minimized with information about a game, but not an actual game. $Selben explained you can browse the web during your breaks if it is in moderation and work safe. $BadIntern seemed a bit perplexed by this but slowly nodded after pondering it over for several moments.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSoon after, $Snickers was nominated to train the interns on a new process he had created. He was only able to locate two of them, with $BadIntern missing again. After a brief search he gave up. Rather than crowd everyone into his two-man cubicle, he opted to take the interns into a conference room. They entered the darkened room and flipped on the lights. With a loud bang, $BadIntern jerked up and hit his head on the table he had been, apparently, asleep under.\n\n&gt; $Snickers: Were you sleeping in…\n\n$BadIntern ran out of the room.\n\n$Snickers looked under the table and found a blanket, a cell phone and a small pile of crumbled sandwich wrappers. After a more careful inspection he saw different names on the wrappers and recognized many of them as people from different parts of the office.\n\nIt was explained to $BadIntern that the “free sandwiches” that he had “found” were not, in fact, for him. He was reprimanded, and food for staff meetings seemed to go missing less often. $BadIntern was caught napping in the conference rooms several more times and was warned he would lose his internship if he kept it up. He seemed to stop but would still randomly disappear at times.\n\nA few weeks after his internship ended (which he did complete), a janitor made the discovery of “the nest” in a broom closet. He found the exact same blanket from the conference room and a large collection of snack wrappers. Fortunately, it didn’t look like it had been used recently.\n\n$Selben looked over at $Snickers, who was starting to turn red with anger, when they heard the news.\n\n&gt; $Selben: It’s okay, he’s gone now.

We offer free troubleshooting so as you can imagine, we get some characters that come in. \n\n\nOne day in particular, I start to help a gentleman who had gotten locked out of his phone that he had purchased the day before and needed help getting back into it. Our process for this to erase the phone and set it back up, since we have no way of overriding the password. \n\n\nI explain how the process works to him, and he asks me, \"Will I get my contacts back?\"\n\n\nAnd I respond, \"Well sir, there's no guarantee but [cloud based server] typically syncs contacts automatically once you log into the phone. If it's not in the cloud, then they might be tied to an email account and if so, will come back once we log back in.\" This answer seems to satisfy him, and he makes a joke about starting fresh and not worrying about people calling him. \n\n\nWhile the erase runs, we chat about luxury brands and how he wishes he had bought stock before Coach acquired Kate Spade. He tells me about his business, what he does. We have good rapport going, or so I thought. \n\n\nThe erase finishes, and we start to setup the phone. Immediately he has issues remembering his account password to see if he has a backup or anything saved to the cloud. After a fair bit of bitching, he remembers it and we get in. There is no backup. I explain that we need to setup the phone as new, and reiterate that his contacts *might* be still be recoverable. \n\n\nWe proceed with setup, and when the phone gets to the home screen, I check for his contacts. They are not saved in the cloud. I make a reference to his previous joke about starting fresh, and his attitude does a 180. Immediately he starts cursing and talking about how it's our fault he lost his contacts and how we had BETTER get them back. I take that as a cue to step into the back hallway and let my manager know what's up in case it gets any more escalated. \n\n\nWhen we both came back out, he storms up to us and angrily says, \"I have a year to live! I am not leaving here until you get my contacts back!\" \n\n\nOn that note, my manager sends me to my lunch break, which I was 30 minutes late to at this point. When I get back, she pulls me into the hallway and fills me in on what he did after I left. She had agreed to try accounts with him but informed him that if he doesn't know the passwords, there's nothing we could do. He calmed down a bit and tried some passwords with her but ultimately didn't know any, and eventually left, agreeing to try passwords at home. \n\n\nAfter walking away, he walked back up to my manager and said to her, \"You know, you should be nicer to someone who's dying. It doesn't even seem like you care.\"\n\n\nAbout an hour later, he left a survey comment under the salesperson from the day prior in which he claimed that I was incompetent but trying, and my manager was cold but knowledgeable. Despite this, he called us both cancer to [company].\n\n\nLater I find out that the salesperson actually personally knew this man and he was not, in fact, dying or sick at all. What an absolute loon.

I ask for the computer number as we have that many and I start walking towards the computer where the lady is seated. Let's say it is number 314 for geeky purposes. Something in the back of my mind knew there was something wrong with that computer, I had a feeling that I got an earlier call for it, but I couldnt recall it fully. \n\nAnyway, I pick up a new keyboard from storage just so I dont have to walk back and forth constantly and I head towards this lady, confident that I will fix this problem and be called \"smart\" for changing a keyboard. \n\nI arrive and suddenly I remember. Computer 314 had a broken ethernet cable which needed to be replaced, but we for some reason had none laying around (often times people \"fix\" stuff themselves, unaware that we like to keep track of our storage). So to clarify that it was broken it had a note on the keyboard saying \"broken\".\n\nThis lady sat down there and thought only the keyboard was broken. Fine, not sure why you don't just pick another computer then, but okay. She actually grabbed the keyboard from computer 313 and moved it over to her computer. No unplugging the keyboard from 313 and plugging it into 314, no, she just moved the thing over. \n\nShe just moved the thing over and expected it to work.\n\nNeedless to say, this made my day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

You know computers so your friends and family just offload all their problems onto you instead of figure out how to solve them themselves. It's a tale as old as time. Well, this short entry describes the pain I suffer from one particular member of my family.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy dad is a smart dude. He's an A.P. teacher so revered by his school district that, although he never would admit it, he's to go to guy for many students, teachers and administration members. Everyone who meets him is overwhelmed by his intelligence and worldliness. He's travelled the world, worked in many fields including television, hospital management or, of course, teaching.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYet for all this he still doesn't know how to use his technology correctly.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe's not ancient, and he's not a stranger to technology either. Just at this moment he has an iMac, a Mac, a Windows 10 laptop, a Samsung tablet, an e-reader, an Apple TV and an iPhone. But the requests for help are pretry constant whenever I see him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThia particular story revolves around his iPhone, which he had just purchased at the time. It goes a little something like this:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDad: I'm so sick of this new phone! These are supposed to be the best phones out there (lol) but I've only had the thing a few months and it's already slowing down and can't hold a charge.\n\n\n\nMe, knowing exactly what the problem is immediately because this happens all the time with every family member: Let me see.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCue: examining phone to reveal evwry single app he owns in open, from banking to shopping to school (college courses in your 50s, yo. That teacher life) to work to, well, everything.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMe: Dad, show me how you close apps.\n\n\n\nDad: Well, I press this button right here. [Presses the home button.]\n\n\n\nMe: Right. Well, you're not actually closing apps when you do that. You have to do this. [Shows him how] Your phone wasn't running slowly because there's something wrong. It's just that every app you've ever used was open.\n\n\n\nDad: Oh.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nDad: You should work for the Apple Store! They'll pay you to do stuff like this!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme...*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: To all those saying \"That's not how iOS works!\" all I know is it solved the problem and ever since my dad started closing his apps he's had no complaints about slowdown or battery life.",

I just wanted to share that.\n\nEdit: double word/missing word",

He got one of my helpline people up-in-arms today.\n\nJoyboy had called in because he got some drawings released, but he'd checked the wrong files in to the objects. These objects went through a review process, but the reviewers must be pretty crummy, since they let this error get by. So Joyboy wants our helpline to just put the files in.\n\nThe key part is that Mr. Joyboy works for a government-regulated area of our business. There are federal laws which determine where reviews are required, for example. So my helpline person rightfully said, \"No, you need to revise your objects and put the proper files in.\"\n\nThis is what prompted Mr. Joyboy to respond, in e-mail, \"Really?\" To which my helpline person said he'd talk to his manager. Mr. Joyboy then copied my helpline person on an e-mail he sent to a number of his coworkers, saying he was going to have to make them go through the whole review process again because my person wasn't being helpful. This, understandably, upset my person.\n\nIn discussion with my other helpline folks, mentioning \"Mr. Joyboy\" got an instant, \"Oh, *him*!\" reaction. Apparently, he has a habit of doing this sort of thing.\n\nHis business area has superusers who can do what he asks...if they deem it acceptable under the rules dictated by federal law. We can't make that call. We told him to talk to those superusers.\n\nBut it seems he wants to pester us and make us look like the bad people, for not letting him break the rules, after already failing to do his job.\n\nI'm waiting for him to pushback on the idea of talking to the superusers in his area, because I'll be more than happy to forward his actions to our internal auditors and his manager.",

She had gotten a glowing referral from the person she and her husband had bought a hotel from.  As soon as she said that my warning bells went off.  \n\nI confirmed her address/hotel name and no surprises its the infamous hotel I just blacklisted.   I explained a little bit of what had happened and she embarrassingly admitted that was her husband.  Soon to be ex husband specifically, she apologized, offered to pay the last call out and also pay me again to fix the network.  She promised he wouldn't be on site or need to be contacted on the phone and would pay the base call out fees in advance.\n\nAgainst my better judgement I went out this morning early to look at what happened.  Before I started work I had the lady sign our paperwork, pay the last call out plus a retainer for the work she wanted us to do today.  She asks me to tell her everything that happened in detail.   After I was done she apologized again profusely and explained that her and her husband started a divorce in the middle of buying this hotel but it was too late to back out.  He never really wanted to buy it and she was getting the hotel in the divorce.  He was pissed he had to manage the hotel for a month and stopped paying bills as some sort of power play on finances. The old front desk manager quit and he never told her. So things kept getting worse and worse as the front desk manager was supposed to be running the day to day operations.  They had already lost their biggest housing contract for the hotel and a good portion of the long time staff. \n\nSo then I go look at what he had done. Nothing as bad as I might have expected.  Everything was just unplugged so people would stop complaining about the internet not working.  It was a simple matter of plugging everything in and testing connections.  Then the lady got trained on the equipment along with the front desk person I worked with last time.\n\nShe did tell me to call the police if he started harassing us again and that he wasn't supposed to be involved with the hotel at all ever again.  \n\nSo happy ending I suppose?  The whole story feels a bit sadder with the full context.  I hope she can turn things around.",
