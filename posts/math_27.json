I take classes self paced and as such do not have professors to reach out to and so am asking the community.\n\nI would appreciate feedback on all of the foundational subjects I should learn, and then guidance on how to move to a field in my interests.\n\nFirstly I assume the basics are(undergrad level)  Calc 1-3, Linear Algebra, Discrete, Topology, Differential Equations, Abstract Algebra, Real Analysis(I've seen referred to as Advanced Calculus). what else may I be missing?\n\nNext, I was looking at Tropical/Algebraic Geometry as an upcoming REU is focused on it, googling around I saw that it has applications towards optimization/algorithm efficiency in computer science, as well as mathematical physics.  Very much sparked my interest.\n\nThe REU specifies only a knowledge of Linear Algebra.  However on Reddit I see recommendations of needing Differential Geometry, Projection geometry, commutative algebra, number theory, manifolds, diving deeper into topology and abstract algebra first, and many other prereqs to learning Algebraic Geometry.  Ive also seen a google result that simply said Algebraic Geometry is taught from the ground up without prereqs.\n\nHow do you guys focus on attacking an advanced subject after you have taken all of your foundational courses?  I started watching a lecture series on Tropical Geometry, then thought better if I start with Algebraic geometry(from seeing responses to other threads on the subject).  Now it seems like a rabbit hole of prereqs to get lost in.",

        "text": " \n\nHi everyone--\n\nI run a heavily homebrewed TTRPG game and am currently designing out the war systems. I currently have a system in place that looks at an 'army composition' of a military force and ultimately assigns it a strength score (typically marked as a single integer in the hundreds or low thousands).\n\nBasically, I'm trying to make it so that, when one army strength score is the same as its opponent, there is a 50.00% chance for who wins.\n\nI represent this 50/50 chance by digitally rolling a d10000, to represent it down to the tenths of a percent (XX.XX% either way).\n\nI can do that fine! If they're even. I take one of the strength scores and divide it by the other, which I multiply by 2, and it represents it as a 50/50 chance in Excel. There's a real chance some of you just tore your hair out when you read that. Please note I have an English degree, and failed almost every math class in college, before calling me obscenities.\n\nThe problem, as you might expect, comes when they're not even. If that's the case, then the scale slowly gets out of hand the further away they are, up to the point of obscenity.\n\nFor example, if one army strength is doubled another (say one is 10,000 and one is 5,000), then it's either a 0% or 100% chance of winning. I don't want that, but I don't know how to fix it, or what equation to use.\n\nI do have an idea of how I want the scaling percent odds to result:\n\na straight fight is 50/50\n\ndoubling strength is 66/33\n\ntripling strength is 80/20\n\nquadrupling strength is 90/10\n\nquintupling strength is 95/5\n\nBeyond that, it caps at 99.99% but never quite gets there.\n\nI'm willing to be totally flexible on the scaling, so long as it's a sort of 'curve' to it. I don't know what the curve is called--exponential? Logarithmic? I'm mostly at a total loss.\n\nBasically, an equation that I could plug into Excel utilizing the two strength cells to get a percent % result that feels close to these kinds of odds is what I'm looking for. Any and all help is appreciated in figuring out what equation that would be. Thanks!",

        "text": "The axiom of infinity in ZFC is sometimes presented as being \"infinite sets exist\", but the actual axiom is a lot more explicit. Specifically, it says that there exists a set which contains ∅ and is closed under succession. That is, there exists a set which contains all finite von Neumann ordinals. It seems overly specific to me when compared with the other ZFC axioms. So I wondered if the naive version (\"there exists an infinite set\") would work, and I think it actually does.\n\n---\n\nAssume ZFC minus the traditional Axiom of Infinity.\n\nDefinition: a set is a *natural number* if it can be obtained by successively applying the successor operation (*a* ↦ *a* ∪ {*a*}) to ∅.\n\nDefinition: a set *A* is *finite* if there is a bijection between *A* and some natural number.\n\n\"Axiom of Infinity\": There exists a set *S* which is not finite.\n\nUse Power Set and Separation to construct the set *R* of all finite subsets of *S*: *R* = {*r* ∈ 𝓟(*S*) | *r* is finite}. By assumption, *S* is not in *R*, so for each *r* ∈ *R*, *S* \\ *r* is nonempty. Use the Axiom of Choice to define a choice function *F* : *R* → *S* where *F*(*r*) ∈ *S* \\ *r* for all *r*. Now let *s**_0_* be any element of *S*. Let *s**_1_* = *F*({*s**_0_*}), *s**_2_* = *F*({*s**_0_*, *s**_1_*}), *s**_3_* = *F*({*s**_0_*, *s**_1_*, *s**_2_*}), etc. This sequence is an injection *f* from the class of all natural numbers to *S*. By Separation, the image of *f* is a set. We can apply *f*^(-1) to this set using Replacement to obtain the set **N** of all natural numbers.\n\n---\n\nSo this seemingly weaker axiom doesn't actually lose anything. It seems like weaker statements of axioms are preferred because they seem more \"basic\". My guess for why this one isn't used is because I think you need AC to make it work, so you wouldn't be able to make set theory without the axiom of choice.",

        "text": "I've been taught that interpreting a, let's say, 95% confidence interval on some population parameter as \"there is a 95% chance that this particular confidence interval contains the population parameter\" is incorrect and this would rather be something called a credible interval.\n\nMy logic was that let's say you hypothetically have the set of all possible samples from a population and you magically put them all into a hat. For each, you also can calculate the sample statistic corresponding to the population parameter and the 95% confidence interval. Pick one out of the hat at random, then the probability that the sample you picked contains the population parameter within its CI is at least 95% (I say at least because to my knowledge if there is a finite amount of possible samples then it could be possible to have a greater than 95% chance, correct me if I'm wrong). \n\nTo me at least, this \"probability of picking a random sample from a hat knowing that at least 95% of them contain the population parameter in the CI\" is equivalent to saying \"there is at least a 95% chance that this one particular sample I took has the population parameter contained in the CI.\" To me, collecting a sample is exactly equivalent to picking a sample out of this magic hat.\n\nBut, apparently this is wrong under the frequentist definition of probability because the population parameter is already set in stone and it's not a random variable you can assign a probability to. But again to me this just seems like an issue that arose from an arbitrary way of framing the problem. An analogy would be if my friend flipped a coin and covered the result. Let's say the result is heads, then I make a guess and say it's heads. If you ask \"what's the probability that the coin is heads\" I guarantee you most people would respond with \"50%\" and not \"that question is nonsensical, the coin is either heads or it isn't, it's not a random variable at this moment and thus you cannot assign a probability to it.\" Most people would look at you like you're weird if you said that.\n\nI searched through several forum posts and YouTube videos trying to find someone who could properly explain why this interpretation of confidence intervals is wrong. Most videos just regurgitate \"because the population parameter is not a random variable\" without going any deeper. Even Khan Academy who usually does a good job explaining things did this one video on interpreting confidence intervals where one of the answers in a multiple choice question was my interpretation of them (the wrong one). He simply said something along the lines of \"this is a questionable interpretation\" drew a question mark next to it and moved on then the video ended and he never looped back around to it to explain why. I'm starting to think that most people who keep repeating that this interpretation is wrong don't *truly* understand why and are just repeating it because that's what they've heard over and over again.\n\nThe closest I've come to understand it, right on the edge but I never got there, was this top answer on this post [https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/26450/why-does-a-95-confidence-interval-ci-not-imply-a-95-chance-of-containing-the](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/26450/why-does-a-95-confidence-interval-ci-not-imply-a-95-chance-of-containing-the). The reason is the example he gives from David MaKay's book which I was sort of able to follow along with but not quite. But, that example while I think it makes sense, is hard to compare and apply to confidence intervals pertaining to say population means, sums, or proportions for example which I'm currently dealing with trying to learn statistics. Like the example there was constructed specifically to show that confidence intervals are not credible intervals, but it's difficult to apply that idea to confidence intervals in the context of a population mean. \n\nAre there any other good examples you guys might know, ideally, showing for a confidence interval constructed around a population mean that shows clearly why the confidence interval would not be the same as the credible interval and why they must be interpreted differently? I've learned stats from scratch like 3 or 4 times in my life but nobody has ever properly given a satisfactory explanation in my opinion.",

This year I want to do well on it and not just because I got lucky. For those of you who are familiar with the test  is there any specific fields I should look in too. I've looked at former tests and I can handle most of the questions fairly easily  but the later multiple choice questions and the longer questions are completely foreign to me.
