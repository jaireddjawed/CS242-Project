It's a fascinating concept that has been explored in science fiction for decades, but what if it were to actually happen in real life?\n\nWhat would be the immediate reaction of people all around the world? How would the discovery affect religion, philosophy, and society as a whole? Would it change the way we view ourselves and our place in the universe?\n\nMoreover, what if the aliens we discovered were more technologically advanced than us? Would they be peaceful or hostile? Could we learn from them or would we be in danger? Would they have any interest in forming a relationship with us, or would they see us as insignificant?\n\nI'm eager to hear everyone's thoughts on the subject. What do you think would happen if humans discovered extraterrestrial life tomorrow? Let's discuss!",

        "text": "First of all I want to hear what you guys say tell me what you think would happen. Ok I think we would be pulled out of our orbit since the gravity of a neutron star is really close to a black hole add any more mass and boom you have death itself (not death from puss in boots) but HELL basically darkness but lets stay with neutron stars I say we would be in a binary system for about 8ish minutes but the neutron star would suck up the sun (I think) and maybe if we lived far enough we could live with this star that is now the new sun or we would die idk what do you guys think. Thx if you reached it this far. I am sorry this was so long thx for reading.",

The towel would eventually crack. Could this also happen to the universe, that it would just split in half in the middle?",

        "text": "Hello, layman here! 😊 so I’m trying to understand how exactly black holes evaporate. I understand it up to a point : virtual particles materialize in pairs. Usually they annihilate each other. But when they appear near a black hole, one gets sucked in and the other escapes and this is seen as radiation emitted by the black hole. Thats the part I don’t understand. The particle was never part of the black hole so how is that considered as the black hole evaporating?",
