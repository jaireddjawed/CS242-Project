        "text": "I graduated recently with a BS in EE and would like to know what career options exist for someone interested in analog electronics. For my electives, I focused on analog courses as much as I could, including microwave electronics, and two semesters of analog ICs. They were a bit overwhelming and I understand it takes a lot of time to become somewhat comfortable and competent with analog circuits, beyond basic DC circuits. I'm finding that analog seems to be concentrated in IC design, RF circuit design and power electronics. Are these the main career options for someone interested in analog? I have a romantic view of the old days when every electronic made was analog and think I was born too late, unfortunately. It seems that electronics are entirely digital/embedded and the only options for a career in analog are the few I previously mentioned. What would be the best career for someone who is fascinated with analog electronics? Also, would all these analog careers require a master's for the most part?",

        "text": "Hey!\n\nI am a new user, and I have read and abided by the r/ECE guidelines in preparation for my post. I am frustrated as to what career route trajectory is there to focus on. \n\nDespite the fact that I've witnessed a growing trend of engineers transitioning into data science, I'm actually interested in exploring how my data science background can be put to use in the electrical engineering sector. I suppose I'd be happier if my job involved genuine engineering rather than the boring data doodles I've been doing. In addition, I have other obligations that I need to focus on in the future, and I don't want to become a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" by spending too much time in the data area. \n\nAfter earning my physics degree, I took an internship in the field of data science at an engineering firm. I'm frustrated since I've only completed one semester of my master's degree in EE, but I'd like to become an engineer and work on projects that contribute to the greater good of society. People I've talked to have advised me to forego my engineering degree since I'm already working in the industry, but I don't like to give up easily and am worried that if I switch to a career in data science or software development, I'll come to regret it. I hope to one day pursue a profession in the electrical engineering field (though I'm still undecided between the power, telecom, and spatial domains).\n\nMy second worry is that because I was never an A+ student and/or particularly brilliant, I may be at a disadvantage in the professional world because most of my peers are more intellectually gifted than I am.\n\nI would like to have some perspectives from you.",

Monitor quality is also bad, colors aren't vibrant and looks dull\n\nI and many others that I've talked to who live in Vancouver BC, Vancouver Island and Washington State have all suffered with this issue for years. There is an entire online forum dedicated towards this \"dirty electricity input lag issue\".\n\n[https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewforum.php?f=24&amp;sid=635699a636e3659c3dd67dce773251e1](https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewforum.php?f=24&amp;sid=635699a636e3659c3dd67dce773251e1)\n\n And there are YouTube videos (which you can find by searching the quoted text above) of people coming out recently with people from Europe and North America all with similar desktop input lag symptoms.\n\nthis issue exists outside of my computer so reinstalling windows does nothing to help. ive tried a online double conversion pure sine UPS battery off grid and that didn't help. I've tried EMI filters online but they were probably \"snakeoil\" products. \n\nOne of my friends talked to an electrician a few years back about this same issue but nothing could be resolved\n\nThe only thing that has actually relieved symptoms of \"heavy &amp; sluggish mouse movement, and input lag\" has been plugging in a Heated Iron into my power bar which leads me to believe it also could be related to Reactive power.\n\nAnother thing is EVERY night from 11pm until 7 or 8 am my bullets, and mouse movement feel way snappier as if the issue disappears when the power grid is less congested.\n\nbasically I'm asking you guys if there is a possible permanent consistent fix as I've tried everything except moving very far away.\n\nThanks",

I currently work at a controls engineering company designing temperature sensors  (My job title is product design engineer) and while the work is somewhat engaging, it's no longer super interesting to me. It was my first job out of college and i've been here for a couple of years. I've been thinking about what I would need to do in order to switch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo switch industries, it looks like I have two options. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Get an MSEE degree through CU boulders with a specialization in power - This would require me to brush up on some calculus and differential equations math my EET degree never covered. But I would graduate with a masters degree and some work experience. However I would have no actual real-world projects to show employers since I am busy working full-time.  Total cost would be $20,100 and it would take me 3 years to complete.\n2. Self-taught - This path is riskier, but cheaper and much faster. Coursera has excellent videos on magnetics design and various power supply topoligies such as Flyback, SEPIC, Cuk, charge pumps, and inverters (these videos are actually part of CU Boulders MSEE program). Texas instruments has some great documentation for the math behind designing power converters. My plan would be the following:\n\n* Build a micrcontroller powered birectional DC-DC converter\n* Build a Flyback topology AC-DC converter\n* Build a DC-AC inverter\n\nAll three of these products I would design a PCB for using EAGLE and simulate in LTspice (both skills I learned from work) and built from the ground up.\n\nEatimated time: 18 months to build all three of these. I would have an online certificate from Coursera and three functional products to demonstrate my knowledge. Cost for everything would be under $5000.\n\nRight now I am leaning towards option two, but option one brings some benefits such as a masters degree that will stand out in a resume pile. Which path should I take?",

        "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nI‚Äôm currently a 4th-year computer engineering student and uncertain about what career I want to pursue after graduating.\n\nAt first, I was determined to become a control system engineer, so I used 2/3 of my technical electives on controls class like classical control systems, and digital control systems. I enjoyed what I learned in those classes and is what makes me enjoy engineering. However I‚Äôm hesitant about pursuing this field as a career because of the limited opportunities available, and its application. For one, the only opportunities I could find for control system is in the defense industry. I don‚Äôt see myself working in the defense industry and would rather work in tech. In addition, my current background limits my opportunities to the embedded side of controls. I‚Äôm interested in doing pure controls as a career(i.e. designing block diagrams), but found out that I need to pursue higher education to get those jobs. I have considered PLC programming as a career and do find it interesting. However, it‚Äôs not as lucrative as SWE. I also don‚Äôt like the idea of having to travel to different places to do my job. I prefer to work at one location.\n\nOne of my main reasons for picking computer engineering is to have the background necessary to become an SWE. If SWE wasn‚Äôt a lucrative field, I probably would‚Äôve been an EE major. The salary potential of SWE over-engineering didn‚Äôt faze me enough to sell out to SWE. But WFH opportunities for SWE have started to make me reconsider. In addition, there are SWE opportunities where I live, whereas if I wanted to pursue control systems, I‚Äôd need to move away from home.\n\nIn truth, engineering is just a means to an end. If money wasn‚Äôt an issue, I wouldn‚Äôt pursue engineering. As such, I prefer working a job that pays the highest salary but job satisfaction and ethics are still important factors for me. I think I‚Äôd have better job satisfaction if I pursue controls as a career. But, I feel that the benefits and salary of SWE would outweigh my job satisfaction for it. Not that I don‚Äôt dislike SWE as a career. I just wouldn‚Äôt mind pursuing it if the compensation was right.\n\nI‚Äôm really not sure what to do. Whether to combine my interest with my job, or just treat my job as just a job.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

But I could also just finish out the current Masters (1.5 years in), but it would be extremely unrelated to my profession. \n\nSo long story short, should I drop out and go back later for a more relevant education?

A little about myself: I work at a small engineering firm as an electronics technician, where we make time-domain reflectometry instruments to locate faults within a cable.  We make other equipment but the TDR is our big seller.  I have an associate's degree in electronics but I feel the ceiling of opportunities is pretty low at this level and I would like to learn more and expand my career a bit and get into engineering.  Due to having a full time job and a wife and kids, I only have the evenings available to study.  I anticipate completing this degree in 6 or so years due to my other commitments, but better late than never I suppose.\n\n1. I would like to stay at this company as long as possible and learn as much as I can, and hopefully become an engineer there once I finish the degree.  Is there anything related to TDR technology I should be learning to get ahead of the curve?\n\n2. Should I be learning some programming as well?  For my associate's degree I had to learn how to program a PIC microcontroller with the assembly language, but I didn't find it that useful and would like to learn a high level language.  What languages should I be focusing on?\n\n3. I've heard about the STM32 development board, would it be a good idea to do some projects on that?  I also have an Arduino and I am familiar with prototyping circuits on a breadboard.\n\nThanks for any info.",

Unfortunately, my independent series cannot begin at zero for my experiment as it is a spatial frequency. When I compute the instantaneous phase from data where the series begins elsewhere, the phase profile is correct, but there is a DC shift in the phase.\n\nHow can I correct for this error due to my start position?

While I'm grateful to be in a position like this, I'm genuinely stuck on what to do. \n\nMy dilemma doesn't really involve the roles of the internships: I'm pretty interested in both software and hardware (honestly the choice of what to do is a problem for later, i.e. next app season), and I've been alternating between software and hardware heavy semesters. I'm pretty sure that I'll learn a lot at either company anyway. \n\nTo be honest, I don't think that I would go back to Apple even with a return offer because I want to stay in NYC after I graduate. I really liked both of the interview processes though, and genuinely wouldn't mind a summer in Cupertino, but staying in NYC is also appealing. \n\nMy decision mainly comes down to the value of both companies on a resume: I thought Atlassian was pretty well known in the tech industry but from talking with my friends and Apple recruiter they had no clue what it was, which indicates to me that maybe I should go towards Apple for the resume boost. Is Apple that much more reputable to warrant picking it over Atlassian?",

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nI'm in kind of an interesting position. Where I work is about 80 miles away from where I live. When I have to commute in the drive takes me about an hour and a half to do it. I did this full time for nearly 4 years and it's absolutely soul-sucking to have to do it. I then swapped jobs over to my current position where they let me work from home full time and I've loved it. Have a great setup to do it, enjoy being able to see my family as soon as I'm off work as opposed to right before the little ones go to bed, or run and get lunch with my wife and kids, etc. \n\nThey're pushing back on WFH, haven't given many big raises to anyone in the two years I've worked there, and today announced they're doing away with PPO healthcare which as someone who has a two year old and a one month old that's a complete non-starter.\n\nI'm not really looking to move at the moment since my little girl is a month old. We want to be close to family in case we need help, hence why I'm not looking for other opportunities in that area. Also my wife and I have been wanting to move to a different state for a while so starting a new job here would keep me here for a while. For reference, I live in Alabama and work in the Huntsville area.\n\nSo does anyone know of any companies that still allow full-time remote employees? \n\nMy job is a bit weird at the moment. I'm split across two programs, one where I do embedded C dev and VHDL work for FPGAs and the other program where I design power systems and do system simulations/analysis, grounding design, cable design, routing, etc. My previous position entailed a lot of power systems design. I much prefer working in power but am open to anything other than the embedded/VHDL stuff... Just isn't for me even though I am capable of doing it.",

        "text": " \n\nI'm in charge of the electrical subsystem of an RC plane I'm building in a team. Part selection is almost done, just waiting on control surface torques so I can size the servos.\n\nI made a schematic of the circuit in PSpice by creating parts as part of a custom library.\n\nI need to analyze the final circuit to figure out what battery is required.\n\nAs such, I need to model these parts as actual circuit components, instead of just a bunch of connections if that makes sense.\n\n**If I have power consumption and internal resistance available for each part, can I use this information to model each part to a point where, if done correctly, I can size a battery?**\n\nIm not an EE (close, an ECE) and it has been a while since I touched analog circuits. I'd imagine I could do something like plop a resistor down to model the internal resistance of each part with a current source in series to model the power consumption as well (paying attention to the direction).\n\nWould this work? Is there some other method I can use? I can't seem to find a way to edit these attributes of a part I make.\n\nThanks for any help",

The companies I am interviewing for are extremely competitive, but I thought just with the large number of interviews that I would get SOME offer by now.\n\nJust kind of frustrated because it's hard to both interview and focus on classes.",
