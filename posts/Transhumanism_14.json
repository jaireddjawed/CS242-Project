Although what happened to them was horrible, for those who love civilization the correct reaction is 'too bad'. Nobody was going to cry for the working class women who faced misery anyways. It was only after a millionaire died of the radium treatment that people began to  give a damn about it, and the guy who applied it, a Harvard dropout, was not punished and had a very successful career at IBM during World War 2 (he died of radiation effects, but did live till 64, not bad by the standards of the day).\n\nSuch kind of sacrifices by those lower in the social rungs are needed to study how various new stuff affects the human body.\n\nThere are billions of poor people in the third world, and lots of people down their luck in the advanced countries. I think that to advance transhumanism, it will be necessary to re-legalize unlimited human experiments, with limiting any kind of damages at, say, $25,000/case.\n\nTo reach Transhumanism, a radical re-approach of things, and abandoning the false notion on human rights instilled during the '60s, are needed.",

While I think life extension and cybernetic enhancements will definitely exist, I'm not sure people could(or even should) become immortal robots. Cyborgs, yes, but replacing our entire organic body with something artificial is something I don't think is possible. \n\nWhile I do think we could place brains IN artificial bodies eventually, I don't think we could really replace the brain, nor is it guaranteed that replacing our organic meat bodies would be an improvement(the word singularity is apt here, because we really don't know.) I see a future of life extension, intelligence enhancement, genetic modification and technology built into our nervous systems and even our cells, and even parts of the brain being replaced by something artificial, but I just don't see the whole brain being replaced as possible.\n\n I could be wrong, I'm not a neuroscientist, but it seems like even if we could transfer our memories to a sapient artificial intelligence, it wouldn't be us though would be a kind of \"mind child\", a futuristic type of reproduction based on memetics rather than genetics if that makes any sense.
