        "text": "The use of \"respect\" in tiktok, youtube shorts, ect?\n\nSo this probably my first question as a starting to be out of touch with upcoming generations. I am 31, currently without children, and wouldn't consider myself out of touch normally. But as above what's with all the \"respect\" videos/tiktok/youtube/whatevers knocking about? In pretty much all of them it's got someone either doing something that you should be doing anway, like holding a door for someone, giving your seat to someone who needs it more than you, picking up something someone less able or unaware had droped. Through to some tasks that most would consider repetitive or menial, usually to a high standard or extremely quickly which in context are impressive not traditionally respected. Often alot of them contain things that are really stupid or dangerous, or just carrying something, or an animal doing something. All the videos usually have some dramatic music and then just \"respect\" written across the screen. \n\nI just don't understand the use of \"respect\" has the meaning evolved or changed? Is it one of those things where the upcoming generations are so desperate to be deemed as respected that they are assigning what anything  they want as something to be respectful beyond the norm? If I am missing something then please explain, I just find the use of the term interesting/out of place compared to my understood use. \n\nOf course I am also assuming this is a western generational thing over that of a cultural difference I was potentially unaware of.\n\nLink for context:\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/IcnQnxvUPsk?feature=share",
