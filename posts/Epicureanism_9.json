        "text": "It is general election time in the UK and I thought I would share some insights I’ve gained from the Epicurean disengagement with politics. \n\nI used to be a politics junky. I would watch the news, read the papers, never let an argument go. What did these things do for me? Nothing pleasurable. \n\n\nYou become angry at the opposing side. How can they possibly be looking at the same facts as you and creating such-and-such a policy? The politicians and supporters of parties you disagree with become enemies. How do you feel when you see an enemy? The sensation is never pleasant. If you see them fail… Well you may feel some joy there but it is hardly an appealing trait to take happiness from the misery of others.\n\n\nBut you also become angry with your own side. How can they possibly be supporting this? How can they not be attacking that? \n\n\nIf you disengage a little from this tribalism you begin to see things more clearly. Is an Us and Them mentality helpful? Do you find yourself defending things you do not really believe simply because it was suggested by ‘your’ party? Do you attack a policy you support because of who suggested it? Without reason your ability to judge the right course to take simply become a toss of the dice. By allying yourself to one side or another you put in jeopardy your control over your life and your pleasure. \n\n\nHaving friendships means negotiating the differing opinions held by people. It is impossible for two people to think exactly alike. One of the pleasures of friendship is discussion. But I found politics was disruptive to my friendships. Arguments, which in a clear light would not amount to all that much, became heated because of politics. Since disengaging myself from politics I find any disagreements weighing far less heavily on my relationships with others. We talk, we argue, but there is no great split between us. \n\n\nWorse than the hazards to friendship caused by politics is the risk that politics will make you hardhearted generally. There is a programme called Question Time where an audience asks questions to a panel of politicians. It can be quite informative, though more often it is simply infuriating. The politicians are evasive, the audience applauds such nonsense that you end up despising absolutely everyone involved. How can people ask such stupid questions? How can they support such foolish answers? And these are people you assume are more aware than the average voter as they have gone out of their way to be in the audience. Politics can make you misanthropic. \n\n\nIs the average voter qualified to make decisions on foreign policy, economics, jurisprudence? Probably not. But then nor am I. By removing myself from questions about which I cannot fully understand I remove a source of anxiety from my life. No one person can master everything. Concentrate on the things you can control and you bring pleasure within your control.\n\n\nThe final argument against engaging with politics is that in the area I live one party regularly takes an overwhelming majority. My vote, in any direction, is wildly unlikely to make any difference at all to the outcome. All that pain for no result?\n\n\nI will spend the time I would have used in going to the polling station in taking a stroll beside the river. ",

        "text": "The great duty that epicureans have in our modern society is to provide guidance on how to maximize the quality of one's life.\n\nFor some, epicureanism is mainly about avoiding pain (mental disturbance) and choosing pleasures wisely.\n\nFor me this is not enough, because as a society we live in a world with much less pain in the acquisition of necessities, than in ancient times. Our problem now isn't pain, but how to best use our free (non-pained) time. Epicurus anticipates this by suggesting a focus on mental pleasures (discussing philosophy, remembering beautiful memories, gratitude) as well as on friendship. But I feel this is not enough or perhaps its a bit too narrow.\n\nTo give a quick example of this: If I told you I knew two people. Person A, spent most of his time playing video games. Person B, spent most of his free-time reading poetry. If we asked a normal epicurean, which of the two has a better quality of life, the epicurean would probably say either, that its a preference. \n\nFor me, its clear that one who spends his time playing videogames has a poorer quality of life than one who spends his time reading poetry, because the former is relaxation and the latter is leisure\n\nLeisure improves the mind/body via voluntary choice of activities that involve mental creativity. Relaxation is a passive stimulation of the senses usually for pleasure.\n\nPart of the problem with Epicureanism or at least part of the criticisms are due to the fact that there is not a clear enough distinction between leisure and relaxation. \n\nEpicurus's view of leisure/relaxation is also too narrow. Leisure consists of hobbies, contemplation of beauty (philosophy/poetry), and play. But for Epicurus we get only contemplation of philosophy as leisure.\n\nThere are other aspects which for lack of space I will not include here, like the value of toil (strife), and how strife or effort should not be confused with pain.",

        "text": "The following quote is from [a letter by Thomas Jefferson](http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/presidents/thomas-jefferson/letters-of-thomas-jefferson/jefl50.php) and comes from a dialogue between his head and his heart. Jefferson's head displays some markedly Epicurean leanings...\n\n\n&gt; This is not a world to live at random in as you do. To avoid those eternal distresses, to which you are forever exposing us, you must learn to look forward before you take a step which may interest our peace. Everything in this world is a matter of calculation. Advance then with caution, the balance in your hand. Put into one scale the pleasures which any object may offer; but put fairly into the other the pains which are to follow, &amp; see which preponderates. The making an acquaintance is not a matter of indifference. When a new one is proposed to you, view it all round. Consider what advantages it presents, &amp; to what inconveniences it may expose you. Do not bite at the bait of pleasure till you know there is no hook beneath it. **The art of life is the art of avoiding pain: &amp; he is the best pilot who steers clearest of the rocks &amp; shoals with which he is beset.** Pleasure is always before us; but misfortune is at our side: while running after that, this arrests us. The most effectual means of being secure against pain is to retire within ourselves, &amp; to suffice for our own happiness. Those, which depend on ourselves, are the only pleasures a wise man will count on: for nothing is ours which another may deprive us of. Hence the inestimable value of intellectual pleasures. Even in our power, always leading us to something new, never cloying, we ride serene &amp; sublime above the concerns of this mortal world, contemplating truth &amp; nature, matter &amp; motion, the laws which bind up their existence, &amp; that eternal being who made &amp; bound them up by those laws. Let this be our employ. Leave the bustle &amp; tumult of society to those who have not talents to occupy themselves without them.\n\nThough it must be said he then goes into a denunciation of friendship which is not really in keeping with Epicurean thought. [Edit: I should say his head puts forward an argument against friendship, his heart is much more reasonable on the matter] But the above quote, particularly the bold part, is perfect.",

His argument for dismissing it seems half-hearted however.\n\nYes, when we die we cease experience. I agree with Epicurus that I do not fear an afterlife. Loss of life still prevents potential future pleasure. It may leave obligations to friends and family unfulfilled. It may cut short the legacy of wisdom that one may pass on, imagine if Epicurus had died at the age of 20 before his philosophy.",

        "text": "Because Epicureanism fell out of favour for so much of history there are many Epicurean terms which either have not become common parlance or whose meaning is not immediately apparent. Even the term Epicurean itself has been distorted. Here is a list of some of the more useful terms which appear in Epicurean studies. Feel free to add more in the comments. Hope all is well.\n\n**Aponia** – An absence of pain. For Epicurus pleasure was maximised when you no longer experienced any pain.\n\n\n**Ataraxia** – A state of profound tranquillity. Ataraxia is achieved when you have no more worries or fears at all.\n\n\n**Apatheia** – The Stoic analogue of Ataraxia. Apatheia is the state of mind achieved when the passions are controlled, perhaps even entirely removed. \n\n**Clinamen**- This is the term given by Lucretius which describes the random motion of atoms in a void. In the atomic theory of the Epicureans without this random swerving then atoms would not have been able to form larger objects by collision. The random swerve also prevents the universe from being deterministic.\n\n**Epicurean epistemology** – Epistemology is the study of truth and knowledge. How do we know what we know? Epicureanism has three main routes to knowledge. Sensations (**aisthêsis**) are the information our sense organs receive and refer to the mind. These are always right, though we may misinterpret what we are sensing. Preconceptions (**prolepsis**) are those ideas which all people share, universal ideas. Feelings (**pathê**) are those things which are true for us, our own sense of pleasure for example. A square of very dark chocolate may make me happy but it is not a universal experience.\n\n\n**Eudaimonia** – An objective goal of a philosophy. Eudaimonia can be translated as ‘good spirited.’ Eudaimonia is the state a philosophy aims to place its practitioners in, a state in which they are flourishing. It varies from philosophical school to school but for Epicureans Eudaimonia is pleasure (as understood by Epicureans, see **Hedonism**). \n\n\n**Gods** – Epicurus was parodied by other philosophers as being an atheist. His surviving letters show that he did believe in gods, but perhaps not in a way they or we would recognise. The gods of Epicurus were beings within the universe, composed of atoms, and utterly unconcerned with human affairs. They lived lives of ataraxia and aponia.\n\n**Hedonism** – Named for the goddess embodiment of pleasure – Hedone. Hedonism is the pursuit of pleasure. There are many schools of hedonistic philosophy, of which Epicureanism is one. Hedonism can be the mindless chasing of any pleasurable activity or a more refined study of the maximising of pleasure in a rational manner. Epicurus explains some the possible confusions hedonism can imply-\n&gt; When we say . . . that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.\n—Epicurus, \"Letter to Menoeceus\n\n**Katastematic pleasure** – Literally - Pleasure at rest. A katastematic pleasure is a pleasure one feels from ‘being.’ So aponia is the katastematic pleasure one feels when you are without pain.\n\n**Kinematic pleasure**- Literally - Pleasure in motion. Kinematic pleasures are derived from ‘doing.’ The pleasures of eating, drinking, conversation, those derived from the senses. \n\n\n**Otium** – A Latin term which has a number of distinct meanings. For Epicureans Otium was the quiet joy of an unassuming, contemplative, life. Thus otium is at odds with the Romantic idea that heroic struggle is something to be sought out.\n\n\n**Materialism** – The belief that matter is the main constituent of the universe and that all phenomena are derived from the interactions of matter and the laws of the universe. Epicureanism is a materialist philosophy because it does not posit immaterial souls, or spirits, or gods made of divine stuff. Not to be confused with a love of material things.\n\n\n**Soul** – When Epicureans refer to the soul they generally mean consciousness or mind. The Epicurean soul is composed of atoms and does not survive the destruction of the body.\n\n**Tetrapharmakos**- A short summary in four parts of the beliefs of Epicurus recorded by the Roman Epicurean Philodemus. \n&gt; Don't fear god,  \nDon't worry about death;  \nWhat is good is easy to get, and  \nWhat is terrible is easy to endure.\n",
