        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/zrrao3/if_hearing_loss_causes_death_from_sudden/",
        "text": "In 2007 a team of scientists noticed that 31 people with right-sided hearing loss died suddenly in their sleep. They said that hearing loss is a cause of sudden death during sleep, since the inner ear hair cells - microscopic, sound detecting cells in the middle ear (not to be confused with visible hairs that you can see) - act as respiratory chemoreceptors that stimulate autonomic breathing. They then patented a device which wakes deaf people up if the device detects breathing problems during sleep. The same team of scientists later proved this hypothesis (that hair cells are respiratory chemoreceptors) in experiments on mice, 3 years after creating the patent. After doing these experiments, they said that in humans, damage or loss of these hair cells will cause death from respiratory failure.\n\nWhat about people who are completely deaf then, such as Hellen Keller? She went completely deaf when she was a child and she lived until she was 87 years old.\n\nHow do scientists explain that? And why is any paper talking about hair cells being pivotal for breathing always authored by the same team of scientists? Why aren't other teams of scientists talking about this discovery?\n\nAccording to Oxford Academic, loss of hair cells is the leading cause of hearing loss.",

        "text": "A team of scientists said hearing loss is a major risk factor for sudden death during sleep, since the inner ear cells act as respiratory chemoreceptors that stimulate autonomic breathing. They patented a device which wakes deaf people up if the device detects breathing problems during sleep. The same team of scientists later proved this hypothesis in experiments on mice. Afterwards, they said that in humans, damage or loss of these hair cells (sound detecting cells) will cause death.\n\nWhat about people who are completely deaf then, such as Hellen Keller? She went completely deaf when she was a child and she lived until she was 87 years old. \n\nHow do scientists explain that?",
