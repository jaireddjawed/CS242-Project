        "text": "I am a 22 year old guy who never had a girlfriend before and I do chat with some girls on Instagram whom I knew in high school days and are 19-22 age range. For over 2 weeks, I had been chatting with this girl who is 20 year old. We were in the same school but she was my junior so we never interacted those days. Now we are in different colleges but still the same city. We chat daily and send virtual hugs to each other daily and she makes me blush and she even says that I am sweet and cute. I feel butterflies chatting with her and I think I am falling in live with her but I noticed that at times the chats get really one sided. Like I ask her how are you and she just replies great and doesn't ask about me and when I ask her whether she had lunch, she just answers yes or no and doesn't ask me whether I had lunch too. Sometimes her replies can be one word. At times she is really sweet and compliments me and we do say that qe will meet and hug each other one day in real life and go to parks or cafes but does it mean she is bored of me as doesn't ask me how am I doing and stuffs like that? Sometimes she does get a bit flirty but other times her replies are dry. Is this normal?\n\nTL DR: A girl with whom I had been chatting sometimes give me dry replies so does it mean she is bored of me?",

        "text": "My bf used to show too much interest in the beginning of our relationship. Calling me, texting me everyday, complimenting me a lot. Also made some hints that he wanted to have sex with me bc he desired me. We ended up having sex 4 weeks after we started talking. He also told me he was a jealous type, and i was okay with that bc i am the same as well so I could understand. For example, one time he said if my gf would go to a club i wouldnt let her go or i would follow her with my car. \n\nIts been 3 months now and I feel like he has changed. Yesterday i told him i wanna visit a museum with a male friend from university. And wanted my bf to come with me too. I expected him to say yes etc. But instead he said “you go, i wont come”. I was surprised that he was reckless. Later then i told him i was disappointed at his reaction. If it was me i wouldnt let him go with his female friend. Then he said “okay im not letting u either then, dont go”. \n\nOn Valentines Day he said he is too busy with work(i know its not a lie, we work in the same office) but at least i expected a rose etc. But i got nothing. \n\nHe used to offer me coffee dates after work. No more coffee dates after work either even when he is not working extra time. \n\nI told him i wanna go to abroad with my friend and he said only “have a good time”. \n\nOne day i texted him “morning love❤️” message and no response from him. He texted me in the evening. The day after i told him i was broken for not getting a morning back. And he told me “u know its bc of work, im busy. I apologize”. But that day i saw him going to lunch with his friends. Its obvious that he didn’t care. I think nobody is too busy to write morning. It takes seconds. \n\nI really dont understand if he loves me or not. \n\nTDLR; my bf was too interested and showed attention in the beginning. But after 3 months he is acting so reckless. It annoys me.",

I am sitting here crying and can not believe my eyes. He is currently visiting friends in Barcelona (we live in Germany). Last night they went out partying. It is now 8:44 am here and I think they are still sleeping. This morning I checked one of his friends instagram stories. On one of the stories you can cleary see my boyfriend in the background being visibly drunk, talking to a girl and hugging her multiple times pretty intimatley. It also looked like they were dancing. They were also coming very close with their faces. That's all I can see. I already screen recorded the story so I have evidence.\n\nI dont know what to do now. He cleary was very close with another girl but it is also not concrete evidence of cheating as they did not kiss. He definitely overstepped my boundaries of acceptable behaviour.

For the first month or so after I told her I love her she seemed on cloud nine. She mentioned listening to voice messages of me saying I love her multiple times a day, and we'd say we loved each other most days.\n\nSince October she's just chilled in that regard. She rarely says \"I love you\" first anymore - I'll be lucky to hear her say it once every two weeks on her own accord, honestly. If I say it first she'll say it back, but not everytime.\n\nThis change in her approach has made me anxious for months. However, since it has been months of her not saying I love you first and there's been no issue otherwise, should I just assume the initial buzz or high she felt from us saying it to each other is gone and that's all there is to it? That if there was a genuine problem I would've known by now since this has gone on since October?\n\nWe still have things planned for the future, heck she's excited about our vacation away together next month. But little things like this make me wonder sometimes. Thoughts?\n\n**TL;DR: girlfriend stopped saying I love you much after initially saying it a lot. Issue?",

We are in a long distance relationship and every time we are together, things are really good.\n\nHowever, she is still really good friends with a guy that she met on Hinge last year who she has had sex with multiple times throughout the course of months. She got into a relationship soon after with a different guy and when that ended, she went straight back to the ex-FWB's house and he cooked her dinner. She told me nothing happened that night, though.\n\nFast forward to 5 months ago, they try hooking up again but she said she stopped right when he grabbed her and couldn't go through with it.\n\nCurrently, she gets along well with him, they're both in the medical field, he was there for her during her dark times and she was there for him during his. She's told me that she only keeps him in her life because he can be of use to her in the medical field in the future especially with helping her edit med school apps because he has helped many people in the past get into top medical schools around the country. All of me wants to believe this and I really want her to have the best chance at getting into the best medical schools, but a voice inside my head just says that this is just her rationalizing keeping him around in her life. I usually give her the benefit of the doubt, but this time I really don't want to.\n\nAm I a control freak boyfriend if I want them to stop talking to each other? And what would this mean for her chances getting into med school?\n\nIf I do want boundaries, what are the correct boundaries to set (what is reasonable and what is unreasonable)?\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriend is good friend with her ex-FWB. She gives decently reasonable claims for why she still keeps him close. Am I being played? What do I do from here?",

Why are emotions so crucial to any initial interest? \n\nTo be fair, I'm a bit autistic (diagnosis and everything), and while I've read and can appreciate the \"why\" as to this (who doesn't enjoy that emotional rush?), at the same time, women hold all the power in the courting dynamic (for lack of a less wordy way of putting it), and that's stressful enough!..\n\n-now I have to learn to unlearn said stress,  and genuinely have faith, and expect my own, what I would consider, simplistic personality to be emotionally interesting enough for a woman my age? I mean, I can make people laugh, and I'm not *that* awkward, but ofc women are smart enough to see through any small talk/banter I could attempt or so I'm assuming,  so what am I supposed to think of, on the fly when interacting with any women I'm attracted to, to keep any interested longer than 5 minutes? \n\ncharisma? how would it not come off as forced or cheesy? I'm all about observational humour and irony, but is that even good enough? \n\nWhy does it need to be this complicated?\n\nWhat's wrong with something to the effect of - \"hi I think you're attractive and I wanted to say hello\" and go from there? \n\n\nTLDR- I'm overthinking talking to women a lot and I'm frustrated with the need for emotional excitement, because I don't see anything exciting about me.",

Just a couple of month prior he had been saying that I’m the best thing that happened to him.\n\nHe said that the reason why he broke up with wasn’t because he didn’t love me but that he had a lot of personal issues that caused me a lot of pain which put more pressure / stress on him to navigate. Even though he broke up with me, he said he would need some time alone to figure out how he wants me in his life (as a friend, gf or even none at all) but he said he couldn’t put a timeline on it.\n\nThis is causing a lot of stress because of this we haven’t talked about who gets to keep the cat / furniture etc and I don’t know if going no contact is the best way to go.

        "text": "We met each other through a dating app around a month ago and soon started talking a lot. Later found out we had several friends in common.\nShe's nice, kind of an introvert (k-popper, weeb...) And both share some similarities both in interest as in life experiences.\n\nWe had our first date after 2 weeks of chatting, as she seems to be really busy. I invited her to a nice japanese restarurant. date went great, talked a lot and got to know each other pretty easily. She would laugh a lot and in general had a really positive attitude.\n\nAfter we finished there, we walked to a near place to hangout, with a nice view, just in front of some popular nightclubs and bars. She told me she wasn't really comfortable going inside such places, so decided to just stay there and continue talking. I noticed she would avoid any kind of physical contact, which I totally respect and understand. Eventually, she told me that her last relationship ended due to his ex cheating on her around a year ago, ending a relationship that lasted 6 years. We changed subjects and continued talking until eventually she said it was time to head back home.\nI then took a cab and acompanied her back to her place. We both hugged, said thanks and farewells, I joked about she owing me an ice cream for the next date, and I then left to my place.\n\nNext days we would continue texting, but noticed that she would often skip answering for long periods of time, often 6 hours or more, just to show up later or the next day greeting and wishing a good day as if nothing. I found this behavior as weird, since I wouldn't understand if she was interested or not in keep hanging out.\n\nSo a few days later I tried to arrange a second meeting, but she would constantly find a reason to not hang out (she was going to the park at night to exercise, meeting some friends, headache...). Eventually, after a week of trying, I managed to agree for a meeting on Sunday afternoon: a walk at the park with my dog and then going for some ice cream. \nHowever, when time came, she never showed up and later excused herself, as she had what she described as an awful headache, so she took a medication that apparently caused her to fall asleep. She then proposed to meet anytime during that week (this week) to meet after work.\n\nHowever, once again, she would find reasons to not do so (started feeling sick, hanged out with some friends). Lastly, tonight, she had bought tickets for a new movie at the cinema with a girl friend of her at late afternoon. So then I offered to go out for dinner after the movie ended, to which she just answered with \"I usually eat at the cinema\". I just replied with an \"ok\" and decided it was enough. After some time, at late night, she suddenly texted me with a \"hey, what are you doing?\" Which I just ignored.\n\n At this point, I don't know what to do. I really like her, and she'd be really nice and open to me in person, but the rest of the time she'd behave in an oddly manner, showing an on and off interest, constantly disappearing and not committing to anything. She's leaving tomorrow for an event outside the city and coming back in a week, one day before I leave for about a month.\n\nI feel I should try to ask her in a straightforward manner on what are her expectations, and if she's not interested, just leave. But my friends suggest I should just stop trying and ignore her. What should I do?\n\n[TL:DR] met a girl who would show interest and then disappear, causing me confusion on how to proceed or just leave",

        "text": "Me, (24 F) and my bf (44 M),- yes I recognize the age difference- separated in September 2022 after almost four years of being together. I moved out and took the kids with me but we did agree on 50/50 custody of the kids, while he kept our house and I moved back in with my parents. For 3 months, we stayed talking, stayed having sex and I would always ask him for us to get back together, but each time he refused. We never talked about getting back together in the future, so it was a break up. In December, I went on my first date and yes, me and the guy ended up having sex. It wasn't anything meaningful, just sex, but I broke it off in mid-January. The entire time I missed my ex, but I will be honest, it felt good to be desired by someone. At the same time, it felt wrong because I missed my ex a lot and knew I still wanted to be with him. My ex did find out about this other guy because he went looking through my phone one day as we were exchanging the kids. He was hurt and upset and did not understand how I could be having sex with someone else while telling him all the while that I wanted to be with him. I explained to him that it was just physical, nothing more, and it made me realize that I do want to stay with him and fight for our relationship. Prior to this, we never had infidelity issues, we were always faithful to each other, we did have money problems, and I do suffer from depression, anxiety, and overall lack of motivation, which did affect our relationship. He is a great provider and father, and I do believe he did his best to support me when I was down. He has 2 other children on top of the 2 we share, so our home was always busy with kids, us working, me going to school, and just overall life. I will say we did argue a lot during our relationship, looking back at it, it was over trivial things, and yes, I do acknowledge that they were probably most of my fault. I continue to tell him that I love him, and that I want to be with him more than anything. I have confided in some of my friends and even my therapist, and they have all said he should not be upset since we were not together in a relationship and it does not count as cheating, and that since we were broken up, what I do is really not his business. My friends have advised me to give him time and space. I am just not really sure on what to do or what to think. Yes, I think deep down, since we were not together he should not be upset by it but I can see why he is. He says he cannot forgive me and me having slept with someone else is a dealbreaker for us getting back together. I really do love him, and really do want to be with him for the rest of my life, and I have begged him almost every day that I am sorry, that I made a mistake, and I will do everything I can to fix us and makeup for what I have done. Any advice given will be helpful, thank you\n\nTLDR: my bf refuses to get back together after we broke up and I slept with someone else, are we really over?",

Maybe it's just because I'm tired rn or having a mood swing but I just don't feel that interested in her anymore. Our relationship became very sexual because she's hypersexual so it kinda killed the mushy romance I originally wanted and it's mostly just sexual. She just burns me out when everything we do or talk about is about sex or turns sexual in some way and it doesn't feel like I'm romantically interested in her anymore but then again it could be because I'm tired. She doesn't really talk to me much which I get because she's probably busy with something and when I do have her attention it's about sex which just gets boring, like I want to be able to step away from that for one second. Sometimes I feel like she doesn't actually care about me outside of sex too. And as horrible as it sounds, I sometimes look at other girls and I feel terrible about it and really bad for her. Some days I just feel like I'm just going along with it for some reason. I'm not sure what to do because a part of me wants to try to make things work but another part just wants to try something else. Btw this is my first actual relationship so it's still new to me. \n\nTL;DR- I'm scared I might be losing interest in my girlfriend so quickly",

I actually hate myself to a certain degree at this point in my life (mid twenties). On the other hand, I’m academically above average, can be good looking (at times), I’m not in shape at all but I hide that by wearing stylish baggy clothes &amp; im a listener when I speak to others (I don’t like to hear myself talk much in social settings).\n\nPeople don’t get jealous by just looking at me (or at least I believe), it’s usually after they’ve seen my grades, performance, social etc. \n\nI don’t go out my way to show off even I’m actually nervous almost all the time in class and don’t actively participate in class but I’ll sometimes force myself to answer questions here and there in class. All of this has led me to having no friends I’m a complete loner (I literally don’t have 1 friend). \n\nBack when I was in great shape I use to encounter jealousy from absolute strangers and find myself getting into trouble (I’d have random dudes try to pick fights with me even).

I was pretty upset by this...I find it a turn off knowing my bf is so unprofessional and that he has no self control. We have sex every night, usually multiple times, so it's even more surprising that he needs to watch porn daily while at work.\n\nFast forward to yesterday:\nHe and I were hanging out and decided to order food. We always use his phone to order food because he's the one who has the account for delivery services. He was playing a video game and handed me his phone so that I could open up the app and start the food order. I was expecting to see his phone's wallpaper, but instead what my eyes were met with was his still open porn tab.... It was BAD. Like, horrifyingly bad. At least to me it was. \n\nThe type of porn he had been frequently watching completely changed my view of him. I find it disgusting, and I find the idea of him watching that kind of stuff at work, and then coming home and having sex with me, gross. I confronted him about it and it was a huge fight. I expressed that I was very uncomfortable with the type of porn he had been viewing, and he got very defensive and said I was being controlling and jealous.\n\nOur mutual friends only know that, \"we fought because of his porn addiction and the type of porn he watches.\" I did not specify to them what I saw, as it's not really my place to be telling other people his private life/sexual fantasies. But now they think I'm being an overly jealous gf who tries to control her bf's porn usage.\n\nHow do I make my friends understand my side, without revealing my bf's porn to them? Or should I tell them what it was, even though it feels like a violation of his privacy?\n\n**TL; DR;: I(28f) argued with my bf(35m) after I discovered his porn addiction and the type of porn he watches.

I am also afraid that this would escalate into something him actually meeting up with different woman / cheating.   \n\nTL;DR Till now he denies taking the screenshot and goes on and rambles about how loyal he is etc. I dont know what to do.",

        "text": "So my (soon to be ex) wife, this girl, and I all work at the same place but not all in the same area. We've worked together for about 3 years but she's started talking to me more in the past year, specifically since I've become a dad.\n\nShe's quiet, shy, and reserved but she's become increasingly chatty with me and I find these days she really tries to keep the conversation flowing. She asks me a lot more personal stuff and volunteers it often as well. I thought maybe this was because she knew my wife, but apparently they aren't really friends (don't dislike each other just don't interact much). This girl has even forgotten my wife's name a couple times when asking about her.\n\nWe had a particularly good conversation the other day, and I feel like her body language was good. It may not be interest, but I feel like she's at least comfortable with me. She was making a lot of eye contact with me, much more than she used to. She was sitting across from me and had her legs crossed, but her uncrossed leg was pointing towards me, and her crossed leg was making her pants noticeably tighter. She also had her head tilted to the side (resting on the wall) kind of exposing her neck, but she wears her hair back so it's hard to say whether that was purposeful or just comfortable for her. We would occasionally break eye contact and then regain it, not sure if that's good or bad? She would look away when telling me something that seemed like it was painful. For example, when she told me her mom passed away she'd look down for a few seconds. But when talking about happy things (like our kids) she'd usually maintain prolonged eye contact. If she did look away she'd look down for a couple seconds and then look back.\n\nWe actually had a really in depth talk about personal stuff such as where we grew up, our family members, parents who have passed away, our kids (she's a single mom), etc. She also started asking about where my family live now, what nickname I have for my son, etc. She's also started getting more... vulnerable I guess, talking about cost of living pressure and stuff like that. Not super in depth, just passing comments but still ones revealing personal information. She also started telling me how she feels about our town, frustrations she's had with finding things to do (particularly with her kid), etc.\n\nMy friend happened to be there for the conversation and afterwards he said \"She sure likes you.\" I asked what he meant and he said she never talks to him that much, only pleasantries. Upon talking to some of the other guys I work with, they've all basically said the same thing. She did briefly interact with this guy while I was there, but only when I brought him into the conversation and she didn't seem like she knew what to say to him.\n\nAnother thing, she's been making more jokes with me and laughing my (very lame) jokes. The other day I could tell she was looking for someone and I said \"Hey you look lost, you ok?\" Our eyes met, she had a really big smile, and then looked down. She giggled a bit and said \"Oh yeah, I'll find myself in a minute.\" or something kinda dorky like that.\n\nShe could just be more comfortable with me, but I feel like she's taken a particular interest in me the last 6 to 12 months as I said. About 7 months or so back, we had a conversation about my son and ever since then she's much more talkative to me. Not sure if they're related. She's said once she's good at judging people's vibes, so maybe she just thinks I'm a good dad and is more comfortable with me now idk.\n\nAgain, not going to get mixed up with this, at least for the foreseeable future (until wife and I are officially split and also my wife is changing jobs eventually) but it would be good to know at least for future reference because I kinda suck at taking hints, but also don't want to make something out of nothing.\n\nI guess part of me thinks she knows I'm married and she knows my wife directly, so I think why would she be interested/showing interest. She doesn't know my wife and I are splitting yet. It's really hard to say because she isn't as expressive as most women I know.\n\nTL;DR - Not sure if my coworker is reservedly flirting with me because I'm (technically) still married, or whether she's just comfortable with me.",

        "text": "Last weekend my boyfriend and I went to the mountains with a couple of friends and rented an Airbnb. My boyfriend was in charge of cooking for the four days we were there and on the second day he made spaghetti with a meat sauce. I lack an enzyme that can process meat so I get a painful stomach ache and my boyfriend knows this so he put a bowl of spaghetti out for me before he included the meat.\n\nWhen we sat down to eat I noticed my food tasted different but kept eating until I got a weird feeling in my stomach and suddenly I ran to the bathroom and started throwing up. My sweet boyfriend followed me and held my air up until I finished. After I composed myself he asked what was wrong and I started yelling at him asking why he is always so neglectful of my health and how he needs to start caring about me. I chewed him out in front of our friends and said some really hurtful things about him for about five minutes. I am known to have a quick temper and it was on full display that night. I have been trying to work on it but I still have a long way to go. None of the things I said were true of course. My boyfriend always puts my best interests first and has never put me in any danger while we have been together. \n\nAfter I finished screaming my boyfriend didn’t say anything and just walked out the front door. My best friend asked what happened and I reminded her how I can’t eat meat and how the spaghetti I ate included beef. Another friend asked me if the black bowl on the counter was mine to which I said yes and he said that bowl did not have any meat in it and he accidentally added it to the pot of spaghetti.\n\nI realized I made a huge mistake and ran to find my boyfriend who was walking on the side of the road. I tried apologizing to him but he refused to listen to me and said I crossed a major line with him. He said he has put up with my temper for two and a half years but he is sick of always walking on eggshells around me trying not to set me off and yelling at him over spaghetti in front of his friends and my friends was embarrassing at it is an issue he might not be able to overlook. He started crying and said he wants to be with me but incidents like this make him question if I am the person he wants to be with for the rest of his life. My refusal to take accountability for my actions is driving him crazy and he told me to leave him alone.\n\nI walked back to the house and stayed in our room waiting for him to come back but he slept in his car and we ended up leaving a day early. He said nothing to me on the ride back and all week long he has barely said a word to me. I know I messed up big time and I don’t know how I can make it up to him. He is the nicest and most patient boy in the world and I really hurt him.\n\nTD;LR: I yelled at my boyfriend over an incident that was not his fault. He said this might be the last straw for him and to leave him alone. He has barely spoken to me this week despite me apologizing constantly.",

        "text": "My (M18) girlfriend (F18) doesn’t have as high of a sex drive as I do. The last time she and I got intimate was about a week ago(Sunday). Even then, she stopped it early because it was too risky with a ton of people going in and out of the house and possibly in my room. To which I understood and tried my best to let her know that I wasn’t upset about it at all (I really wasn’t upset). Then Thursday rolls around and we hang out privately for the first time since Sunday. And because of our last intimate interaction, and how it was stopped early, I was somewhat expecting to do some things. But then right as we walked into my basement, she says “I don’t wanna do anything today” and I didn’t show her that I was upset, but I was really disappointed. It bummed me out for basically the rest of the day because I was really looking forward to it. I love hanging out with her, I really do, but at some point I kinda want to do some things. If I bring this up with her, she’s going to tell me that I only want her for her body, and that maybe we just should stop doing things altogether, which isn’t what I want. I just sometimes want to be more intimate and it sucks that it solely depends on if she’s in the mood (almost never). I need to know if I even have the right to be disappointed about this and if I should just be happy hanging out with her without being intimate, or if I should express my sexual needs to her and hope that she doesn’t think I just want her for her body. \n\nTLDR; gf doesn’t have a high sex drive like I do, causes some internal complications for me.",

But I opened the text and see flirtatious messages being sent and message being liked this was on Instagram mind you and her profile is private so she added him back before texting. She was saying things like hey we should catch up and asking if he has a car and background on that I don't have a car yet and my moms boyfriend keeps telling me that I need to get one before my girlfriend leaves me and I bring this too her for reassurance and to let her know that I believe in her. but when John tells my girlfriend he has a car she ask him why hasn't he came and seen her and my girlfriend has me posted on her profile so he responds by saying he thought she was dating someone and she says back that it's not like that and she just wants to catch up but then he says I'll still come see you and I wanna see you anytime and I'm not worried about your boyfriend she responds by putting the laughing emoji on the text where he says he's not worried about me. he then tells her to give him her number or text his other account and my girlfriend gave him her number and said just text me and put a smiling emoji and then he says my girlfriend needs to unblock him and she said she blocked him because he called to much when I brought that up in person with her when I confronted her she said she had him blocked since middle school which didn't make sense to me but he responded by saying my girlfriend needs to put him on game and let him know when to call and that he's not trying to mess up her situation. the messages stop shortly after that with her leaving him on seen. When I confronted her she said she just wanted to catch up but later on admitted that she did it because one of her friends said I was being friendly and flirting with a coworker and that friend had no evidence and she's know for being messy because she caused problems before my girlfriend says she's really sorry and it won't happen again and she was just playing around and it was a dumb mistake but throughout our relationship she constantly says she never like cheating and she would never do it and she sees how it effect relationships but then she does this she also says that if I didn't find it she was gonna plan on telling me everything but I don't believe that what should I do?\n\nTL;DR my girlfriend entertained another man",

        "text": "Idc about myself (F19) in this situation and our relationship but I do care about him (M20), we have been through a lot together and have been dating for 4 years and have been doing long distance for 2 of them. \n\nI’m worried about him.\n\nHe only does part time college. In his first year he started full time but dropped a few course so that he could play video games some more (his parents didn’t know he had dropped classes), he was doing 2 courses a semester not the typical 4 for where we live. In his second year of college he started with 3 after his parents found out (he said he dropped out for mental health reasons but confessed to me that it was all a lie and that he just wanted to play video games). By the end of last year he was only doing 1 course however he was refusing to go or do any of the assessments and exams. I’m not his mum and so I can’t force him to go to school each day and I live in a different state. I knew he was playing video games all day and wasn’t going to class but I promised him I wouldn’t tell his parents.\n\nHe doesn’t have any real life friends and only has 1 on the video games, he has never tried to make friends at college or joined any clubs or teams or sports. He used to have friends and play sport but he no longer enjoys any of those things and instead wants to play video games all the time. It’s his 3rd year this year and he has received a letter from the college threatening to kick him out if he does not pass any courses this semester (he is doing 2 courses).\n\nHe plays at least 16 hours of video games a day…. He is already failing his classes with the mid-term examinations coming up really soon. He has a job but rarely goes because he doesn’t want to stop playing video games or if he does go he won’t sleep the night before so he can play video games all day - that’s another thing he rarely ever sleeps or eats or showers it is really bad.\n\nHis parent consistently took away his video games when we were in our final year at high school around exam times and during that time he was incredibly angry and irritable. \n\nHe has ADHD and so I understand that the video games give him a high increase in dopamine every few minutes or so.\n\nHe lies to his family about how often he plays video games however I do suspect that they are realising it has become a problem. However both of his parents are incredibly busy and as much as they love their kids they sometimes don’t have time to just have an hour long chat unless it’s something really bad or really important so there has always been some disconnect between him and his parents especially because his parents were both finishing their degrees when he was born so he was brought up mainly by his aunt and grandma, his aunt has just had a baby and his grandma is really sick at the moment. \n\nHe has wasted two years of his life so far and it is only getting worse, I’ve heard some storied about people wasting 6-12 years of their life and loosing their jobs or never being able to complete their education and loosing everybody that care about them. \n\nI’m lost and idk what to do to help. I feel like if I say something to his parents I am destroying his trust in me as he also has trouble trusting people but every time I try to talk to him about it he either shuts down and refuses to talk about it or he gets mad and won’t talk to me. I think he knows it’s a problem but doesn’t know how to help himself. \n\nHe also has a therapist but he has never once talked to her about any of this stuff, and consistently lies about everything from his emotions and study to basic basic things like that I live in a different state.\n\nI have tried suggesting that he joins the military because where I live they offer structure for his life, an actual degree at the end and pay him to attend and in return all they require is 3 years of mandatory service (we have both done scouts and military trying in high school) and so he genuinely does love it, and he is considering it but is worried that he won’t be able to play video games as this training/education program is in an actual training facility and not at home.\n\nTLDR; he is wasting his teenage/early 20s by playing video games as he has no friends, no passions, no goals and is possibly going to get kicked out of college for it",

It’s gotten so much worse since Christmas (2022) \n\nA little background. My bf came from a very abusive situation and definitely has trauma. I try to be patient with him. He is very reserved and likes a lot of alone time. I feel very compassionate to his past and don’t want to push him too hard out of his comfort zone. He has really been hurt… \n\nHere is the situation… He only really wants to see me about once a week and we don’t really text very much. He will call me at night sometimes to “sleep call” as we call it- just us falling asleep otp. He always calls me over emotional bc I cry a lot but it’s mainly because I feel hurt by him not meeting my needs when I explicitly tell him what I want/need. I do think I am high maintenance but I try to work on it. I have anxious attachment style and he is avoidant. Recently, he has not picked up my calls because he says it’s emotionally draining to be otp with me and I just wanna talk and hear his voice. His uncle who he lives with now apparently thinks I’m controlling bc I like to text him and call him. He just creates so much distance in our relationship I don’t know what to do. \n\n\nThe reason I feel confused is because I feel like what I ask for is normal but he makes me feel so unreasonable. I just asked him if he wanted to hangout before spring break and he said no I don’t want to see you. We have only seen eachother once in the last two weeks. He makes me feel so bad for asking to call and never wants to and says it’s so much work being otp with me. He tells me I’m too emotional and stuff even though I only cry because I feel like he ignores my needs. He says I only make things worse for myself by worrying about us… I don’t know what to believe. I feel like it’s not normal but me makes me feel kinda crazy sometimes. Am I over reacting?\n\nTL;DR :\n\nI feel like I ask for normal relationship things but my boyfriend makes me feel like I am asking too much. Help? Am I overreacting or am I being gaslit??",

        "text": "It all started in december when we started to talk on Tinder(while he was in an abusive and toxic relationship). I made him quit that and he’s really grateful for that, so there’s nothing bad in what I did. He had been doing it for 1,5 year until then and I had to force him to make a decision between me and his ex. \n\nHe chose me, but since then we haven’t even made each other laugh, he’s really introvert and I’m really-really not. Sometimes it feels like I have to be an introvert to get close to him and it makes me really anxious. We match, we play with the same games, listen to the same music. But even in games he plays alone and don’t even let me play with him, he does everything on his own. It’s really hard to think of losing him, although my mental health is the most important for me.\n\nHe takes care of me, as it seems to be he loves me, but my mental health is unstable due to these things. I’m an extrovert and I have to start every single conversation and as he states :”I ain’t got no problem with you, it’s all perfect”. \nI always try to communicate, but “I’ll try harder and everything will be alright” won’t solve these things all the time. \n\nI don’t know what to do and how to do it.\nTldr: I’m the biggest fan of cats, but he’s allergic to them. If I had known that he is, I’d never date him..\n\nAny ideas?",

        "text": "For context I’m 30F dating my boyfriend 36M for 4 years now. Exactly 4, it’s our anniversary. What was supposed to be a great happy day turned sour because I’ve been sick with guilt all day. I tend to beat myself up over small things sometimes though, so I’m coming here to find out if I need to be worried/guilty or if it’s not that big of a deal. \n \nOk so today I was looking for a specific conversation in my fb messenger from a long time ago when i got distracted by some messages between me and some guests I had at my place years ago. Seeing these messages and that they happened while I was dating my bf makes me feel extremely guilty. Please let me know if I should feel like crap the way I do or if I’m overreacting.\n\nSo, back in 2018 (before my bf and I even met) my roommates and I decided to airbnb our spare room for money. These two guests came around Halloween and they were French backpackers on a tour across the US. One was blonde, one brunette. They stayed with us for their NY leg of their trip. They stayed a couple nights and we all went out partying on halloween. It was fun, we all had a good time and they were pretty cool dudes. We added them on fb and it was nice to watch them continue on their journey after they left us. Idk if it was their mannerisms or the fact that they shared our small spare room (which only had a twin sized futon), but I honestly remember thinking they were gay. They were actually best friends but just remember for this story that I thought they were a gay couple. \n\nMy bf and I started dating March 2019, 4 months later. It had been a while since we (my roomies and I) had airbnb’d, it got to be too much for us to deal with.\n\nFlash forward to new years of 2021. Me and the backpackers had had each other on fb for a couple years now, no messages exchanged, just an occasional like on their posts and whatnot, usual bs when you exchange fb’s with ppl you meet lol. The one with the short hair sends me a happy new years message, i say the same back and we start a totally platonic exchange about where he’s traveled, which countries he likes the best etc. Completely harmless until… he decides to tell me that he always thought I was hot but didn’t want to say anything since he thought I was dating someone at the time when he stayed with us. I said no i wasn’t back then but now I am. He says ok and that he figured he might as well give it a shot. Idk what for, since he was back in France at this point and I’m in New York. I had thought he was gay up until this point but now that I knew he wasn’t I feel that this was the point I should have stopped conversing. But I’m just not the type to leave someone on read, idk, it feels so disrespectful so I finished that convo completely platonically, never returning the flirt back to him. He said I should come visit one day, I said maybe one day (knowing full well that wasn’t happening lol) and the convo ended there. I can see in the messages that he replied to my story a couple times after that over the years saying things like my bf is so lucky and heart eyes emojis etc. but I never returned the attraction or anything, just said thanks.\n\nSo in this situation with the brunette I feel I could be wrong for continuing to converse after he called me hot. I mean, it was only a few more sentences said from each of us after that but still. And I feel that I should have deleted him as a friend too. Or is that too far for a simple comment made by a man who didn’t know if I was dating someone when he said it? Idk. Either way he made a couple more flirty moves with those emoji replies to my selfies on my stories which is a bit iffy. Idk, y’all tell me: as a dude would you expect your girl to delete or set a guy straight for replying to her story with heart eyes or “your bf is so lucky” or is this normal and expected when u have an attractive girl?\n\nSo the woman I am today would have no problem leaving him on read after he called me hot, deleting him as a friend, f his feelings, I’m in love with my man. But back then I didn’t want to be rude so I didn’t do that. I feel if I had nipped it right then and there he wouldn’t have been able to reply to stuff with heart eyes and whatnot. Those were also times where I should have deleted/blocked. Clear flirts. So that’s where I am with that. No I didn’t flirt back but I allowed it to happen and stayed fb friends with someone who clearly had a crush. Perhaps I enjoyed the compliments, but I always just said thanks and kept it moving, never had another full blown convo with him. \n\nBut there’s more. There’s also the situation of the blonde. Last summer he posted a pic on his story of the two of them clearly on another backpacking trip, I replied to the story saying “my two fave frenchies!” Idk, just starting a conversation. They looked to be having tons of fun, I wasn’t really thinking of the conversation I had with the brunette over a year ago, just wanting to converse about their new wave of travels which looked intriguing. I enjoy traveling as well so it’s just fun to me to chat about travel. Then the blonde does the same as the friend, turns a completely normal conversation flirty by saying “And what have you been up to sexy Brooklyn girl?” Again, I just ignored the flirt and continued the conversation normally. I’m reading these messages like wtf lol but we continue talking normally and I told him how I finished grad school and was a guidance counselor now. He opened up about not knowing what his purpose is in life and feeling lost and I give him advice which I think made him feel better. He also invites me to come visit France and again I say yeah yeah one day lol.  \n\nI’m not attracted to either of these dudes, had no intention of ever visiting them in France and never flirted back. But for some reason unearthing these old messages has me feeling super guilty. I started out both conversations with pure intentions but I still feel that somewhere in there I did something wrong. Obviously I couldn’t predict what they would say and I thought they were gay up to a point but I feel that after finding out they weren’t and being called hot by the first I should have unfriended them both.  They are now both unfriended but I’ve had anxiety and stress all day feeling like a cheater and couldn’t enjoy my 4th anniversary. It’s crazy bc they’re literally across the world and I have zero interest in either them (oh and did I mention they don’t speak fluent English 😭) but I still feel horrible.\n\nWhat do y’all think? Is it cheating to not immediately shut down flirts? Should I have unfriended them for their inapropriate compliments? Was I wrong to think men and women could have regular friendly conversations? Am I overreacting by being torn up over these old as conversations? Is it my intentions that matter most? I had pure intentions of chatting with ppl from another culture bc that’s interesting to me but now I feel like a bad gf for not having more strict boundaries and enforcing them.\n\nTl;dr I conversed with two former airbnb guests and they both slightly flirted . I never flirted back but didn’t unfriend them as I now feel I should have.",

        "text": "My husband and I have been together for four years, married two. I'm having a difficult time deciding if the feelings building towards him are justified or if I'm not being fair.\n\nWhen we started getting serious we discussed the important stuff like getting a house, kids, etc., and agreed that these were things we wanted. What I didn't know is that he had poor credit from unpaid bills, so a house was put on hold until he could fix his credit. He didn't start right away so by the time he was finally good, he got fired from his job last September. They gave him a good severance and we agreed he should take some time off (our jobs can be high stress and travel, so I get the desire). I went ahead and applied for a mortgage myself and bought a house under my name in December. At that time he also pulled from his retirement to stretch out his money while unemployed. I was a little frustrated because we work at the same office and both saw it coming. I suggested looking for another position before something bad happens, but he said \"two weeks tops\" for him to find a new job so I didn't mention it again.\n\nHe's never had any savings so he did not contribute anything to the house and I didn't expect him to. In fact, when we met he was broke. We make over six figures by the time we include travel and bonus and don't live in a high cost area, so that kind of blew my mind. But he'll do things I think is irresponsible like, for example, while I was on a work trip he bought a brand new Challenger Scat Pack with his only down payment being the trade in value of his old car and now has high monthly payments for the next 6 years.\n\nOur most recent financial-related argument was about putting things on monthly payments vs. outright paying up front. I was taught to just not buy things I can't afford and I avoid monthly payments even if it is interest-free. He puts EVERYTHING spread out in payment forms saying it helps keep more money in his bank account now. I guess I can follow his logic, but I don't agree with it and am not comfortable with it. It affected me because he did this with both of our phones and there wasn't much savings in it - I'd rather have just paid for the device outright but right now I pay $230 a month for two people.\n\nWhat's really made all this boil up is that we did some DIY projects on the house and agreed on a time for him to start looking for jobs. That was back in January and he's only put in a handful of applications. Everything might be different if he was at least actively trying to find a job but he stopped a month ago and said he only has a few months worth of money left. We do split bills 50/50, so he said as long as he is paying his half, I shouldn't care what he's doing. Again, I would completely understand if he was trying and just not landing jobs. I would be more willing to help him out, but if I do now I'm worried I'll just be letting him go longer without looking for work. I wondered if he was depressed but he says he's fine, at least, and he hasn't changed at all.\n\nIt always turns into an argument when we try to discuss money/employment. I try to not bring it up a lot because I don't want to pressure him. He'll say all I care about is money and I can't stress enough that it's actually about his level of responsibility and maturity. I still have places I want to travel, I want to have a kid, but I don't feel like I can trust him to be the partner I need/desire through all of this. I couldn't live with fiscal uncertainty, I had my poor days and I worked hard to get to a comfortable place.\n\nI'm so sorry if I sound horrible, but it's like my respect for him is slipping away. I'm very quickly moving up in my career, I bought a house, I'm going for my MBA. I enjoy always try to push myself a little more in some form and he's very comfortable doing nothing most of the day, he sleeps in and watched TV/games mostly but he will do some light cleaning. These last few months have made a lot surface for me. How can we reconcile our differences? Am I being unreasonable? These are starting to feel like relationship ending issues for me but I'm not sure if they should be.\n\nTL;DR - Husband is unemployed, not looking for work, running out of money, and I don't want to support his poor fiscal decisions. Is there any savings us?",

        "text": " \n\nI am a 27-year-old bisexual man who met a 26-year-old gay guy on Grindr. We hit it off right away and hooked up twice last February. We both acknowledged how good the vibe was between us during pillow talk and we really enjoyed each other's company. We hung out again the following week at my place and had another great time together.\n\nI started to develop strong feelings for him after our second meeting and I couldn't stop thinking about him. I even cried to a friend a couple of days later about how my feelings ran deep for him and that it scared me. I had been with other guys before, but I had never felt this way about anyone.\n\nAfter our second meeting, I always tried to make plans with him, but he was always too busy with school. We continued to text and snap each other, and our conversations were very flirty and sexual. I wanted to spend more time with him, but he made it clear that he wasn't looking for anything serious at the moment. However, he did say that he liked me and we agreed to stay in contact. I even told him how scary this was for me, and that something about him just ran a bit skin deep in me.\n\nThroughout the rest of 2022, we stayed in touch and continued to flirt through messages. However, he never really took much initiative in trying to spend time with me. There were times when he wouldn't respond to my messages for weeks, but I didn't take it personally.\n\nAt one point, he ghosted me for two months and I thought it was over between us. But then he texted me out of the blue to apologize and tell me that he had moved back home to another state to save money and had some other issues going on . We continued to text and be flirty throughout the rest of the year, but I was always the one who was more forward and wanted to spend more time with him.\n\nHe moved back to my area last month and we hung out again. It was great and we hooked up and shared each other's company. However, the next day I felt sick to my stomach because I thought he would just disappear again like he did last year. I tried texting him to tell him how great it was and how I started watching a show we watched together, but I never heard back from him after 3 days.\n\nI got very anxious and emotional a few days later and called him out for ghosting me in the past and for only texting me back when he was in the mood. He apologized and said that he was hesitant to hang out with me because he didn't want to see me get so stressed out if he couldn't return my feelings to the extent that I wanted him to. He suggested that maybe I needed to experience something intimate with another man and that he didn't think he was the right person for me right now.\n\nI told him that I appreciated his honesty and that I didn't want him to feel hesitant to hang out with me or to feel smothered by me. I said that I would like to see him again in the future and that he should take all the time he needs to think about it. I also told him that my expectations and emotions were my problem, not his. I also told him if i have to chance to build that trust up again in order for him about me worry that i'll freak out , i''l take it.\n\nI really like this guy and I'm not sure what to do. I don't think I have a good hand, but I feel okay with the outcome of this situation. I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with it.\n\ntl;dr: I met the guy I liked, a 26-year-old gay man, on Grindr and had two successful hookups. We stayed in contact throughout 2022, but he often took weeks to respond. After he moved back to the area, we hooked up again, but I became emotional and called him out for ghosting me. He said he didn't want to hurt me and suggested that I try being intimate with someone else. I expressed my feelings and asked to see him again in the future.",

        "text": "TLDR;\nThank you to all who previously helped me realize that these are abusive behaviors. I unfortunately am not in the position to leave, but could use some pointers on how to effectively respond when these comments are made. I have had people tell me that I come across as mean towards my partner, but I just honestly feel like I'm at the point where if I don't become slightly assertive then he will continue to walk all over me and continue trying to control me/my life. \n\nBackstory: \n\nWe have been married almost 10 years.\n\nHe often makes comments about what I wear out in public, specifically towards leggings and that he can see my \"ass\" (not see-through leggings, but just being able to see panty lines). I stopped wearing underwear with leggings for a while because of this. Fairly recently, I was getting changed for bed and he saw that I was wearing panties and spent a few minutes questioning me as to why I was wearing them. He has also, on more than one occasion, made comments to me when he has seen other men \"checking me out\".. the most recent occurrence was worded as \"don't think I didn't see that\".\n\nLast week I got home from work, showered&amp;shaved, went up to bed.. he immediately noticed I had shaved and kept asking why, then proceeded to accuse me of sleeping with coworkers. I legitimately just laughed because of how ridiculous his accusation was.\n\nI had spent an extra 15 minutes at work a few days before, only because we work with 2 people on a shift and then have to give turnover. I enjoy talking with the lady who relieved me so I spent a little extra time speaking with her. He had called me the minute I was supposed to be leaving, I sent him a message saying I was still at work and then called him back when I was walking out to my car. He asked what I was doing, why I hadn't left yet and quickly became pretty stern saying \"it's time to come home\". \n\nHe becomes visibly annoyed when I pick up overtime, even if it's during times that he is at work as well. If I get mandated for a shift or any minor inconvenience occurs, he will tell me that I need to quit my job (despite it being a well-paying position with good benefits, a pension and carrying health insurance for our family). It is very upsetting on my part because I know the risks/sacrifices that come with my job and it is what I agreed to. \n\nWe also had an incident come up about 2 years ago where I caught him taking unclothed photos of me without my knowledge, and come to find out there was 40+ more photos I didn't know about. He didn't see a problem with it because we're married, but my thoughts are: he could have just asked, and if he didn't think it was wrong, why do it so many times without my knowledge? As someone who has past trauma, it did not sit well with me and gave me increased anxiety. When I confronted him,  he initially denied it. Then, I told him I already saw the pictures and asked how many he had, he lied again and said there were 10. Continuing to lie to me and then trying to tell me that because he's my husband it's okay. \n\nA little over a year ago I overcame a fear of mine and began seeing a therapist 1x per week (I have since stopped going) When he caught wind of me going, he questioned why and asked why I couldn't just talk to him about things/my problems. He was bothered that I wanted to discuss my life with a stranger, but not with him.  In his defense, I did not tell him I would be seeing a therapist, but only because I knew just how he would react. However, there have been moments where I tried to talk to him about things and get no response/feedback/validation whatsoever because he \"doesn't know what to say\", which is very discouraging on my part and makes it difficult to open up. \n\nAnd most recently, I bought a new pair of jeans - they're baggy jeans, not form-fitting by any means. They're not a style I'd typically purchase for myself so I texted him as we are working opposite schedules so I wouldn't be seeing him.. and told him I purchased them and wasn't sure how I felt. One of the first few things he said is \"who else did you show?\" And tried playing it off like he just wanted to know what they thought. I just don't feel like this is a normal response??? If he were to send me a picture of let's say, his haircut.. my first thought wouldn't be \"who else did you show?\" Like I legitimately didn't even know how to respond to that and I feel like any time I try to speak up for myself an argument ensues and it isn't even worth it.",

We agreed to meet up at Starbucks while waiting for the friend to get off of work. While debriefing each other on our days, he was talking about his and I (21f) received a text from my cousin who’s like a sister to me. \n\n\nMy cousin (20f) has been going through a lot of hardships (parent issues, she got into a car accident, breakup etc) right now so therefore, I just looked at my phone quickly and the text said something along the lines of “going to Ski Resort in my new car wish me luck :P” so I said out loud “hey J is going to Ski Resort. Maybe you’ll see her”. \n\n\nBoyfriend got mad cause “I wasn’t listening” to him but I reiterated everything that he had said about his day in a summary. Even then, he still remained mad. I then decided to end the coffee date because 1. I am not going to argue in a public coffee shop 2. He always accuses me of starting things before he goes out with friends so I was not going to let that happen. \n\n\nI told him to have fun text me when he gets there, left and got into my car and before I closed my car door, he stopped me. He told me he wants to talk about this really quick. I told him there’s nothing to talk about since I proved to him that I was listening and that I was not going to be told I started an argument before him hanging out with friends. He said he wanted to be reassured that I was listening so please say it, I told him that I did because i resaid everything he told me. I said something about how I’m done with this conversation when he doesn’t listen as well. He got up as he was kneeling on the ground, said “you better look in a damn mirror then” and slammed my car door. And left.",

        "text": "Long story short, my mom (32F) wanted a gym buddy &amp; I didn't feel like the gym was something for me. I'm just not a gym guy. My best friend (who I've known my entire life and is 19) said if my mom wanted a gym buddy, he was more than happy to join her. My friend is very into fitness &amp; goes to the same gym as my mom. Since then, he always picks her up from our place so they can go together, which is just simply weird to me. They've cardio classes together, salsa dancing at the gym, kick boxing, mountain climbing - pretty much anything that has to do with fitness, they're doing it together.\n\nOf course I'm not ignored though. They've tried getting me invovled saying it's super fun and that it's good being active. I simply say no. I'm more of walking/jogging type guy, not intense stuff like they do. They haven't invited me to anything in quite a while, so I figured they simply decided not to invite me anywhere due to my same NO answer. \n\nIts beens 5 months &amp; they've formed a friendship together. She even invites him to join us everytime we go out to eat, go to theme parks/events or when she does BBQ at our place. He's an incredible friend who I'm lucky to have in my life, but it's super weird seeing my mother &amp; him bonding happily. He's always very respectful &amp; kind towards her, so I can at least trust he isn't being pervy around her. My mother is also very respectful, yet goofy/silly with him when they're together around me. They genuinely look like great friends that respect each other.\n\nThat's all fine with me, because they're in front of me. But I also get worried about what they do together when I'm not around or at the gym. It's annoying having these thoughts, because I get a bit paranoid. Part of me knows they aren't doing anything together, but part of me wonders if they are. \n\nPlus, my mother is young &amp; very beautiful. She's so hilarious, fun, silly and such an outgoing person. She's someone that makes everyone laugh and smile, it'll be hard to not be attracted to her. I just don't want that person to be a close friend, which is why I worry about their friendship together. \n\nShould I be worried about their friendship? I don't want to tell my mom how i feel, I believe she'll end up feeling bad about this whole thing. She might even stop being gym buddies with my friend and things could get awkward with everyone involved. She loves my friend and is happy she has a gym buddy, so I definitely don't want to mess anything up. \n\nFYI: She's also a single mom, so it's not like she's disrespecting my father or anything. He isn't in the picture at all.\n\nTl;DR: my mom and best friend are gym buddies &amp; bonding together. I'm not sure if I should be worried about their friendship or not.",

Before our fourth date I got the scaries that my feelings are starting to become real and self sabotaged. I asked him if he was seeing anyone else and he said he wasn’t and enjoyed spending time with me and could see this going somewhere. I in turn told him that I have been dating other people [three first dates that didn’t go anywhere(didn’t say that to him)] but I did enjoy spending time with him. I didn’t say I could see it going somewhere back to him. It was a bad attempt on my part to try to seem more hard to get and also I went into the date kinda freaked. Since then I’ve come to my senses and realized I really do like spending time with him and can see it going somewhere too. We’ve been on one date since but i feel like the vibes have definitely changed. The bad date was almost two weeks ago but it’s still bugging me that I messed it all up. I want to send him a text saying something like “been thinking about what I said at xx. I hope I didn’t mess everything up- I really do enjoy spending time with you and would like to see where this goes.” \n\nDoes this come off as desperate and would it push him away more? Should I just leave it be?",

        "text": "I’m new at Reddit so hopefully I do this correctly! I also posted in an advice sub but I was hoping for some more responses - thanks :)\n\n  I (20F) need some advice about how to have a difficult conversation with my parents. For context:\nI love my parents very much but since I left for college, they’ve become controlling and its been difficult for me. One of the big things they are controlling/worry about is “safety”. I often feel guilt for expressing myself sometimes, because if I say something they don’t like, they’re going to worry about it and express their non-agreement, and then I feel guilty for making them worry and like I’m being a bad daughter. I’ve always been well behaved, good grades, no drugs/drinking/sex, my mom always brags about me when talking to other people about how smart I am and everything. My school is about 5 1/2 hours from home, and we skype about every other week or so but text daily. For context, I’m studying mechanical engineering and it is incredibly stressful which they are aware of. When I joined the call last time, I opened it to see my dad’s face looking extremely worried. No matter what I said, he kept asking me if I was okay and if I was eating, looking very very concerned. He doesn’t always do it to this extent, but its very normal of him to worry about things and vocalize it. I understand he’s my father and just concerned but it made me feel like he didn’t trust me to take care of myself, even though I’m in my 20s and have been away from home for some time now. I always respond to his messages, I’m not shady about anything, they know what’s going on, etc.  Seeing his upset/worried face as the first thing on the call made me feel like I was a burden and something he had to worry about, and my heart just sank, not to mention my self esteem. My parents mean well but it doesn’t get communicated effectively, and I end up hurt. Our relationship is slowly improving and I would not consider cutting them out or anything, but it’s been an awkward and hard time for me. \n\nFor the part I need advice on now. I’ve been dating my boyfriend (20M) for over a year and it’s been great. But because of how my parents are, I’ve been afraid to tell them. I know I should’ve taken care of this by now, but I just wasn’t strong enough to handle it then. I feel like I can’t tell them anything because the one time I did (we were still friends then), my mom texted me over and over saying how I cannot trust hanging out with a guy alone and I made a bad choice (took a walk together in a woodsy/nature-filled area close to campus). She didn’t even ask who he was, his name, or anything and just assumed that it was some random guy I guess? I’m thinking one of the next few times that we skype, I’ll announce that I had some news and wanted them to meet him next them they came to visit, which is all true. I want them to be on good terms and to like him. how do I tell them we’ve been together over a year but I’m just telling them now? I fear they’re going to think I’m a liar and don’t trust them or am I hiding something else. They know about us being friends and probably assumed we’re dating, but I just don’t see this conversation going well. I know that I’m an adult and I’m going to keep seeing him whether they like it or not, but I need some advice on how to discuss this with them in a way that’s mutually respectful. I just feel like I’m going to end up feeling guilty and small like I usually do whenever we have any sort of big conversation. \n\nThanks for your advice, and please be kind! &lt;3\n\nTD;LR: I’m not sure how to tell my overbearing parents that I have a bf(20M) of 1 year without them losing trust in me",

        "text": "I \\[20F\\] have someone in my life (3 yrs), a soulmate \\[23M\\], that I love to the ends of the earth. However I come from a background of trauma with narcissistic parents who never really showed love to each other or to me, at least not verbally. Therefore saying \"I love you\" and being verbally affectionate has never come easy to me because it's a very foreign feeling. When I try, it makes me clam up and feel awkward. It's the kind of thing that may seem hard to understand if you grew up in a more loving home.\n\nI've been so bad at this aspect of our relationship and I don't want to lose my soulmate forever just because I have a million unspoken feelings that I can't verbalize (or write to him) too well, therefore making him feel unloved. Sure, we do other things to show affection, but this is an important part as well. I'd appreciate any help or stories from people that come from a similar background &lt;3\n\nTL;DR: how do I express my unspoken affection for someone when I come from a family that never showed love?",
