The thing is, I don’t know where to begin? Do I just start at Genesis 1 and continue to the end of Revelation 22? I have tried but aside from Genesis, Exodus and the 4 Gospels things become difficult because it’s not linear, some of it is law and prophecy, there are narratives but things happen out of order in pretty much all of the books. I have tried to read Daniel several times now because of it’s particular importance to the New Testament but even though I know the story it is so easy to get lost.\n\nI normally use the Douay Reims translation. Where and how should I start?",

What makes an analysis valid or not?\n\nQueer theory, for example, seems like it could be applied to anything, if the author could make a compelling enough case for it -- but that's what amateur video essayists on YouTube do. \n\nIs it about the quality of that case, as judged by academics? Is it about the authority of the theory referenced? What's stopping a layman from choosing any random theme (like \"queerness\"), applying it to any text, and calling it literary analysis? \nHow does litcrit compare to other humanities, like History and Sociology, in the sense of seeking an objective truth vs offering several interpretations of relative pragmatic value?\n\nThis is the Frankenstein paper, by the way: http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/amp/1553/sex-and-sexual-violence-in-mary-shelleys-frankenstein",

I hope its ok to ask here. \n\nI've been inspired and informed by Leo Tolstoy's Christian Pacifism for many years. I have not read all of his fiction but his spiritual writings such as his Confession, Gospel in Brief, and The Kingdom of God is Within You have been very influential to my conscience.\n\nFor some time now I've noticed a trend in search results on Tolstoy in which he is portrayed as misogynist. The reasons given seem unsubstantial to me...that his wife bore 13 children, that she helped a great deal in transcribing his novels before publication, that some female characters in some stories were unsavory, that he willed the rights of his works to the public domain. Certainly it is common knowledge that his wife was not on board with his pacifism, but none of these reasons seem to be overtly misogynistic to me. I do not see that he has a cultural or ideological view that women are inferior or should be treated as less than. I can empathise with those who feel sympathetic to his wife's position, but spousal disagreement doesn't add up to misogyny. Leo Tolstoy seems to me to have been very progressive for the age in which he lived, so much so that he was excommunicated from his church and censored by the state. \n\nHas anyone else come to an opinion on either side of the fence? Are there facts I'm naive about? I am open minded and if this hero must be removed from the pedestal i have put him on, i would like to do so sooner than later. Thanks in advance for any views.\n\nEdited, typos",

I imagine something like that to be fairly difficult to create, mostly because you can show innovations in film on a glance. It is probably more difficult to do the same thing in a book or talk. Are there any \"Histories of Literature\" that are similarly example and \"innovation\" based? I have read the \"ABC of Reading\" by Ezra Pound, and while it goes into that direction it has a strong flavour of crazy ramblings. Ordinary histories of literature do not really do this, I think.\n* What are some innovations in literature that one would show in such a work? Things that have been done well the first time by someone, made big by someone etc. ?

Speaking of Klingons, here comes Worf, whom you might remember from the smash hit television series \"He Cucked You Too, Riker\". Next thing you know, Worf and Jadzia are straight-up married, while Bashir has to content himself with the knowledge -- revealed in the cozy darkness of a gas giant during a harrowing cat-and-mouse game with Jem Hadar -- that Jadzia really enjoyed his flirtations and they might well have ended up together if it hadn't been for Worf.\n\nSometime later, Jadzia is killed. Dax the symbiont, however, lives on in Ezri, another Trill who has to be shipped in on an emergency basis to save her. Naive and insufficiently prepared for symbiosis, Ezri Dax is an awkward, neurotic mess in comparison to the proud and confident Jadzia. Worf, who feels his bond to Dax ended with Jadzia's death, has no complaints about Bashir stepping in to catch her on the rebound. But the woman he was clearly in love with has been replaced, and his relationship to Ezri is tinged with a weird bitterness and imbalance of power that Julian does his best to ignore, though it seems to sit uneasily at the back of his mind.\n\nAnd, I mean, that's basically the end of his character arc, and Dax's.\n\nIt turns him into some kind of tragic hero, but not in the sense I'm accustomed to. It's very noir, but most noir heroes would be cynical enough to see the relationship for what it is, whereas Julian seems to want to pretend it isn't. If I had to compare it to anything, I'd compare it to the bleak tragedy of Floral Shoppe, or other vaporwave music. Katniss from the Hunger Games^(1) has a similar situation, seeming to settle for a man who is inferior to her original love interest who was killed, and certainly inferior to her -- but she seems more aware of it, seems to be doing it consciously out of spite, so that at least she can have a little happiness in her retirement.\n\nIs there a term for this kind of hero arc? Bashir's not really a byronic hero, though both he and Katniss might dip a toe in that pool. And \"tragic\" seems too general, too easily confused with the kinds of Greeks who got violently murdered by cultists or tied to rocks for eternity. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\n​\n\n^(1)I've only watched the movies, so if it's different in the books don't @ me.",

Hopefully I'm summing up his ideas correctly, but I think his main point is that literary studies needs its own conceptual system so that it can study literature as such, without falling into external influences of other scholarly systems. If lit studies doesn't have this, then the field becomes subsumed by external conceptual systems (be it Psychoanalysis, Marxism, feminism, etc.) which are mapped on to literary studies. While this is good for understanding psychoanalysis, Marxism, feminism, etc., it gets in the way of understanding literature as such. From an undergraduate perspective it appears Lit. Studies is fragmented in the way that Frye pointed out in the 50s, though perhaps this isn't true/ isn't a problem. My question is: does literary criticism today have its own conceptual system, and if not do scholars today still think that they need one? Is this observation tired/disproven? A young neumann needs answers. Thank you.",

Had I been allowed to travel back in time, I would have chosen a Masters in Comparative Literary Analysis, but it's best to put those thoughts out of my mind and move forward. I was very pleasantly surprised when my coordinator allowed me to combine Literary Theory with my current program.\n\nThe problem is, after my BA, I never followed any kind of Lit. courses, so I'm missing a lot of background theory. This is where you come in:\n\nI want to analyse and compare two works (preferably memoirs) by humanitarian aid workers. I have more or less settled on the time/place, namely the Rwandan Civil War of the 1990s. (I wanted to pick a crisis that was key in shaping the humanitarian aid field. Additionally, enough time needed to have passed for there to be enough to read about it.) So far I've got *\"Shake Hands With the Devil - The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda\"* (R. Dallaire, 2003).\n\nOff the top of my head, I want to look into themes such as humanity, guilt, post-colonialism, and \"Otherness.\"\n\nI'm just not sure where to start in terms of what theory and methods I should use in order to achieve this. I read some introductory books on literary analysis back when I was studying for my BA, but that was ages ago. I'm currently re-reading *\"Literary Theory - The Basics\"* (H. Bartens), but reading without a direction seems pointless.\n\nHowever, this is meant to be a Masters thesis and I need to raise the bar for myself in terms of what I know. I'm just not entirely sure how to tackle it. What makes matters more difficult is my tendency to not be able to prioritise once I start learning: I want to know *everything*\\*\\*.\\*\\* I like that I'm curious, but perhaps I could postpone my goal to know *everything* till after I've made my thesis deadline.\n\nSo far, the most obvious theoretical application for my thesis seems to be postcolonial theory, but I'm also trying to look at the form of these novels and to link it to the current state of humanitarian aid as a field.\n\nFeel free to tell me if I'm rambling or if parts of my explanation seem ill-defined. I'm still working it out.",

If anybody can critique or offer better suggestions, I'd be ETERNALLY grateful. \n\n\n\n",

They’ve been flirting for so long, I’d love to read what else is in store for them. And Montague is a fine protagonist for his era. I’m nothing like him, not sure I’d like him, but I like reading about him.\n\nI’m not on this binge because I adore Sinclair, rather I’m drawn to his realistic portraits of American life one hundred years ago. As an author, I give him a B. Sometimes his stories end well, other times he resolves conflict or ends a plot line too suddenly that they feel unrealistic. \n\nFor reference, I’ve read in addition to those two, The Jungle and The Brass Check. I’m starting King Coal right now and will read Oil! after that.\n\nCan anyone else recommend some lesser known works by Sinclair? How is the Lanny Budd series?\n\nThank you",

        "text": "I'm currently writing a senior thesis on Pastoral, and am also looking to apply to PhD programs come December. I'm at an interesting and stressful point in my life :) \n\nTwo points:\n1) My writing sample will probably be from my senior thesis. I happen to think that my thesis is sitting on a goldmine, and that Pastoral is really an incredibly fruitful area of exploration that's been overlooked, especially given the methodological advancements in the latter half of the twentieth century by Barthes and Althusser. I'm not the first to think this, obviously, and there have been many attempts to sort of recuperate Empson, by Christopher Norris and the like, and configure him as some prophet/precursor of Deconstruction, etc. (there's a very funny little segment in one Norris' essays where he sent Empson a letter with Structure, Sign and Play and Empson scoffed at all of the nonsense produced by someone he repeatedly calls *Nerrida*) and I know Ian Watt has lambasted this unhappy marriage. \n\nI'm not interested in that; to me, Ideology is a version of Pastoral, and this is a claim I would like to prove. I would like to spend years trying to prove it. I think that the line of inquiry inaugurated by Empson can be read side-by-side these latter developments but that it's essential thrust is stronger, and that it proposes a more explicative modality that is primarily situated in the literary but by no means is limited to it. I know there is a Pastoral of fashion; I think Pastoral can be used to explain Hipster cafes and artisanal beers. It has its own logic and exists in the crossroad and transition points bettween semiosis, poiesis, and aletheia.\n\nNeil Hertz recently released a book on Pastoral in Palestine, but he's retired. I don't think Johns Hopkins would be a bad option at all though. \n\n**Who is doing work on Pastoral? What departments would this work best in?** I am looking at CompLit, not English, because I can already read in four languages and have taken the equivalent of three of French in my undergrad. My own thesis concerns a sort of genealogy of Pastoral with the Greeks (I don't know Ancient Greek but I'm working with a professor who does), and then 16th century Spanish and 19th century Russian Pastoral, two-out-of the way non-modern (and pre-modern) locales and to then show the Pastoral hegemony at work here. Part 3. would be on the uses/abuses of irony in the 20th century (probably taking Sartre's Anti-Semite and Jew as a starting point: maybe some Platonov, Bulgakov and Zamyatin, but I want to do English stuff here, so Joyce, or Pynchon, I'm not really sure at this point.)  \n\n**2) Is this a good mode of trying to get *into* programs?** My idea (and mind you this could be complete fantasy and fabrication on my part) is that if I apply with this rather particular research interest which I think can actually be blown up into a whole other system, would be attractive to scholars also working in such a field. Of course, it's not always department heads reading applications. I don't know, I'm just trying to maximize my chances of admission. What if my writing sample, for example, cites people working in the department, or cites the theoretical intrigues of a sizeable portion of the department? I'm terribly sorry if this is naive, I'm just looking to play the odds as best as I can wherever I can :) \n\nKeep in mind: I am not completely dedicate to Empson and Pastoral. I have a diverse array of interests: currently I think this is the most fertile, and I cite plenty of authors who at first glance have no seeming association with Pastoral (Leo Strauss being my favorite). \n\nThank you for your advice :) ",

All the while it seems to priveledge the reader over the work which I found really presumptuous and pretentious (as if my dumb 19 year old self has the authority to deconstruct a Shakespearean play). This might just be the way my teacher taught the course (very uninspiring, dry professor). Anyhoo, I know Derrida and deconstruction are pillars of modern literary studies, and I wanted to ask you good people of Reddit: what am I missing?

I finished Dubliners a few days ago and I'm finishing up Portrait of the Artist within the next few days (might even just read Exiles for fun, who knows) and I am planning on starting Ulysses soon. I've wanted to read this for a while so I'm excited and I've loved everything by Joyce so far.  I have a couple options in mind for reading Ulysses the first time through.  I do want to understand the main references which Joyce will make, and even though I have read Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, etc., I know I will miss a lot.  \n\nThe two ways I'm thinking about going about it are either to a.) read the Gabler's Corrected Text edition along with The New Bloomsday Book or b.) to read the Oxford World's Classics edition with Jeri Johnson's analysis and annotations at the back. Is one of these methods better and/or more comprehensive than the other?  Or is there an even better method to understand the text?\n\nI know a lot of people will say to just read the book without any other material the first go around, but I know myself and I would just be googling everything anyways, so I would rather have a creditable analysis rather than whatever I can find on the internet.  I don't plan on going all out with reading multiple annotations on word definitions per sentence either, I mostly just want a plot analysis to explain parallels or references to other literature that I may not see. \n\nThanks in advance!",

I mean, reading a novel academically is different to reading for pleasure. Should I be constantly taking notes as I read, annotating, highlighting? And, if so, what exactly should I be focusing on? Should I write synopses of each page or longer sections, or each chapter? And how can I make this as efficient as possible?",
