        "text": "The older I get the more I miss being a little kid. When I was very little I remember going to my grandparents house when both of my parents were at work. They had this big tree in the front yard that dropped spiky ball looking things and we would see how far we could throw them into the road. We would clean the house, play with toys, play in a sandbox under a big tree in the back yard and more. They recently cut down the tree in the front yard and back yard. We would collect trash from the asshole neighbor they have that threw stuff on their lawn and put it in a small wooden wheelbarrow. It’s been so long now but there is just something about little memories that stick with you. I still vividly remember one moment where I was eating breakfast and watching tv as a toddler. Or when my dad would give me vitamins and stuff before I went to bed. I wish I could go back, but that’s not possible.",

I have heard varying stories of what will happen, as some people have told me they felt fine after a few hours, whilst others said that it took them weeks to recover. I do not know what to expect, as the four teeth I must have removed are not impacted like many people's are. The problem with mine is that the tops ones and the bottom ones rub together when I close my mouth and, if they were to be left in, would probably really mess up my jaw over time. The rubbing also has left me unable to close my mouth to where the front top teeth touch the front bottom teeth, as it creates a (relatively small) opening between them. Other than that rubbing, the wisdom teeth had no problems when they came through my gums. I would assume this may help make the surgery easier, as the teeth are all upright, quite accessible and are not jammed against the teeth beside them. I have also my age working in my favour, as I am currently 17 years old and I have heard that similar procedures become more and more problematic the older you are. With this in mind, what should I expect tomorrow? I know that there will be a variety of foods which I will be unable to eat for a few days, but other than that, what should I know in regards to the procedure itself? How long might this operation take, and what will be the effects of the  anaesthetic when I awaken?",

        "text": "Last night before sleep I had random recall of event that occurred many years ago. Basically one of college classes— first day, I saw side and back of one male student for one second I had the biggest gut feeling that I knew him and was very close before.   \n\n\nMind you I never seen him in my life before but the feeling of “He is important” was intense. Whole cell in my body was telling me “hey, hey, hey, hey you HAVE TO introduce yourself this is only chance!!! This is it!!!” Obviously I was like what??? I tried to ignore it but every class my whole existence was telling me I had to do this. \n\nDid I? Nope. I thought it was too strange to tell someone “hey, uh, I am \\_\\_\\_\\_ and I am suppose to know you???? Uh my whole existence is telling me to introduce to you.. apparently it has been waiting for this moment??? Im not sure whats up really.“ Like thats weird. I dont know why… why should I contact someone because my whole existence tells me to?   \n\n\nIts far different than crushes if someone thinks this is like that. Its almost like as if I knew him in past life. Feeling was similar to when you coincidentally saw someone you were super close with for YEARS but havent seen them/contact with them for 30 years walking the street. Did anyone else experience something similar? If you are curious another reason I didnt introduce myself was because he always had a girl next to him. Was not sure whether she was just friend or gf but either way I found it unnecessary to interrupt them for some weird experience on my end.",

He moves on and lives a happy life with his adoptive parents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich got me thinking....he has the technology and power to know more, but chose not to. Why? Some might say \"well he doesn't feel the need to anymore\" and end the conversation like that but let's pick brains for a moment.....do you really think human nature can just simply choose to be ignorant in order to be happy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKind of like if you break up from a relationship. We have the power to stalk our exes on social media but some people choose to block and move on. Do we block because we do not feel the need to know more about their lives anymore, or do we block in fear if we find out something, it would hurt us more? Because I blocked my ex before and yes, it is true I went years without thinking of him so there was no need to find out more info about him and his life. BUT the other day, I was monitoring my block list to, in a sense \"see who deserves to be on here still\", and I saw my ex on the list. I did not unblock him but apparently Facebook shows updated profile pics, and from the small icon that I can see, he is happy with his new gf. Not gonna lie, it did sting a bit that he would not upload couples pics of us 5 years ago, but did for the new girl. So....I wonder if deep down the \"no need to stalk\" is actually a \"fear of getting hurt\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

We kind of rushed into it and paid a little more then what the house was worth as it was a sellers market and now with the market settling our house value is apparently so much less than what we bought it for. Our idea wasn’t for this house to be our forever home but we do plan on staying here for a while 5-10 years or more who knows but we eventually want to buy land. We’ve already remodeled our kitchen and in the process of remodeling the backyard too. I’m scared we made a mistake and when we try and sell we won’t even get how much we paid for it let alone the money we put into it to make it look nice. At the time it seemed like a good idea because everyone was saying buying a house is the best investment you can make and it is better then having to pay some landlord rent and not having our own property to do whatever we want on. We’re in our 20s about to be 24 y/o and I just need advice and comfort that we didn’t make a huge mistake. We are very comfortable here btw, we’re able to make our mortgage payments every month + add some more to reduce principal. I’m just nervous.",

She'll hide if she doesn't like someone. Never seen her be aggressive ever. The only person she actively barks at is my brother. The day we adopted her she ran away and he tackled her to prevent her from running into traffic and she never forgave him lol. \n\nLast night my sister was taking our two dogs out, the other being a blind/deaf 14 year old beagle. It was dark and late. A neighbor who just pulled up asked to pet dogs and approached without waiting for an answer. My chihuahua pushed the lther dog out of the way and got between the man and my sister. She wouldn't let gom get any closer. My sister said the man seemed friendly enough and we are on good terms with the other people who live in his house (we just moved and haven't met everyone yet) so she wasn't too worried. Plus we keep pepper spray on their leashes just in case. I never thought my dog was capable of protecting us. I mean im sure one good kick and shed be dead but she still tried and thats more than i ever expected. She usually hides behind us. I'm just so shocked. I have had this dog for 3 years and she has never tried to protect us ever. I'm happy. It makes me feel safer. Normally she doesn't even bark when we get home. Or i am home and my sister walks in she won't get up until she knows who it is. Now i think if someone broke in st night she would let us know. Before i thought she would keep quiet. My bog theory on why she suddenly protective then and never before is because she has bad eyesight (one eye is completely sideways and wonky) and she is more nervous at night when she can't see as well.",

As I am now in the second half of my second year, it means I have to start looking for an internship soon. It will be my first time working in a full-time work environment. \n\nFor the past few days, I have been obsessed about finding a part time job. Even though I could make more money by taking a part time job in the field of my education, I wanted to work in a fast food restaurant. I've never wanted this before. In my country, fast food restaurants are mostly occupied by teenagers working a part time job.\n\nI realized I want this because I am terribly afraid of having to grow up. In exactly 6 months, I will start an internship and I won't have any classical education anymore. I will have to leave my friends because everyone will be following their own internship and start their own 'mature' life. \n\nI'm going to apply for the fast food job, though. Even though I usually don't like customer service, it feels like it's the only thing that can keep me young for now. I am terrified.",

This thought came in my mind when I saw a person sitting next to my table ordered a ginger tea (basically a big chunk of ginger with hot water). \n\nHave you ever wondered why people use a large piece of ginger in hot water and then discard it? It just doesn't make sense. Instead, you can create a concentrated ginger syrup with the same amount of ginger, allowing you to make multiple delicious drinks without wasting any ginger. It's a much more efficient way to enjoy the flavor and benefits of ginger.",

        "text": "Backstory: My daughter has been afraid of any beeping sound ever since she was born. Wake up alarms on phones, microwave alarm, the car door alarm, oven beeping, and obviously the more obnoxious alarms like the fire alarm/smoke detector alarm. You may be thinking, \"Well yeah, that's pretty normal for a baby/toddler to be afraid of those sounds\". But her fear is deep, she is TERRIFIED anytime she hears these things. Even the mild, quiet, unalarming beeps you hear in everyday life. She will stop, run to me and cry histerically and ask me what is causing the noise. Even after I show her and explain it to her, she will cry until the sound stops. Also of note, she isnt afriad of other loud noises. Dogs barking, vacuuming, book falling on the ground, hammering, drills, loud tv, people yelling, loud crowds, none of these things effect her. Only beeping alarm sounds.\nAnd I think I figured out why. I was an ICU nurse when I was pregnant with her. I had just accepted a position as the nightshift charge when I was first trimester with her. It is a stressful job at baseline, but due to other circumstances on our unit, it was even more stressful than normal. I worked my entire pregnancy in the ICU. \nIf you dont know, the ICU setting is full of many different alarm sounds. Monitors beeping, vent alarms, iv pump beeping, code blue alarms, fall alarms; you get the point. I think she could hear these sounds while in utero and I think she felt my body's stress response everytime an alarm went off. \n\nIs this crazy? Am I full of shit or could this be a viable reason for her extreme fear of beeping noises/alarm sounds?",

Raichu got stolen from me in school, as well as Luxtra and Logock and I don't know what happened to Mewtu tbh. \n\nAnd I once missed a bottle full of juice my mother had given to me. A teacher found it behind the trash bin and I thought my then chaotic brain would have just forgotten it there...now it dawned on me that someone probably hid it there. Assholes.\n\nAnd when I came from sports, the last lesson, the cleaning lady told me that some people in the class had thrown my bike helmet around, making fun of it. Imagine, one crack and it would have not been safe anymore.\n\nAnd the leader of them, we call him C, made jokes about me, up until even the teachers started to call him out on it. He always tried to keep me small, destroy my happiness, take my courage from everything. When I took part in a school play he said to me that he got \"eye cancer\" from my performance. And when he got the news that my cat died, he made jokes about this and about me being sad. \n\nAnd when we had a class trip and C started with his idiotic games once again, I straight up KICKED him in the balls. And he broke down, screaming, crying, like a baby. And guess what. Of course, the nearby parent who supported the teacher said I should excuse myself to C. He said I am guilty in that situation because he understood nothing.\n\nSo yeah. I just realized I was heavily bullied at school, in a random moment. And it makes me kinda angry.\n\nLast I heard, C had a pretty bad motor bike accident. I don't like him, but I hope he's okay.",

Nearly all of these aren't \"red flags\" but are literally just bad behavior or things they don't like. \n\nIt's never the danger itself. A literal example is if you were going swimming and saw a row of red flags in the water it could mean many things but it says \"Don't swim here.\" \n\nA good example of a Red Flag: People who drink in your car while you're driving is a strong red flag that they are an alcoholic or have a drinking problem. Why? If they can't wait to get to the bar or at least wait until the car stopped moving. It's a strong indication that they can't wait which implies something dangerous. Now notice it could go either way. Maybe they are an alcoholic or maybe they just drink heavily but aren't necessarily addicted. Either way, that's a *warning sign* that things could get dangerous if you continue in that direction. Red flags are not detailed. They just show what **could** be.\n\nNow what isn't a red flag? A red flag isn't the literal danger. Let's be clear about that. Red Flags warn of the danger, but aren't the danger itself. So if you see a house on fire. That's not a warning. That's the danger. There are red flags, and there are house fires. \n\nNow that [list](https://old.reddit.com/r/Tinder/comments/11cpd2h/we_spoke_for_about_a_week_when_i_asked_her_what/ja7zku5/?context=3) that showed someone's red flags. Some of these things listed are legitimately problematic at best but other ones are literally house fires. \n\nThe first thing on the list is \"alcoholism\". Yeah that's a house fire. Not a red flag. But then it says \"cares too much about my exes.\" That's fair. That could mean they're obsessive or controlling or insecure. I could see that being a red flag of danger. But then it goes on to say really benign stuff that's not really indivitative of any dangerous behavior. \n\nAnyways I just wanted to point out that not everything you don't like is a red flag. And not ever house fire is a red flag, it's literally the thing you're trying to avoid.",

        "text": "Question is open to your own interpretation, it can be about science, it can be about mental health, literally anything.\n\nWhenever I learn something new but pretty easy and rather obvious, I'm speechless. Life would be so much easier if I knew some stuff before, although I get that some things we just need to experience first.\n\n1. Clean room. Drinking water. Healthy sleeping habits. All three work wonders for our mental health and productivity. Sure, once or twice some biology teacher mentioned this but it doesn't work. If I was shown the actual studies about sleeping hygiene, I'd take care of that.\n2. Saving money. First job. Making a good impression at work. Types of contracts. Manipulation at work and laws protecting you. Harassment. I should have known that in high school. Instead the only thing I've heard about work was \"You shouldn't work, you need to focus on your education\" during my studies.\n3. More stuff about buying cars or properties, types of insurances, taxes.\n4. The importance of learning a third language (or more) &amp; tricks making the process easier since teachers tend to be focused only on what is happening in the class.\n5. Routine sometimes makes our lives better. You don't have to do workout for two hours everyday. But create a habit of 5 minutes every day and it will be easier to change the duration however you want.",

I slept on couches, out of cars, under bridges. I started working when I was 13 at Winn Dixie as a bagger, and in landscaping too. I just wanted a place that was mine, and I no longer had to ask if I could exist there. It's taken 17 long years but I just bought my own Land. 2 acres Paid in full. I also bought a 1996 Ford f350 truck and a 1991 34 foot class a RV. It's not much but it's paid off and it's mine. So for those of y'all still struggling, keep going.",

We wanted to show them around town, go to a show, and attend a sporting event. We really worked our tails off to get the house clean and make it comfortable for their stay. We bought tickets for everyone, cooked multiple meals, and made sure they had anything they needed. We noticed that they didn’t really initiate any conversations, had little reaction or emotions at the game, and were just generally quiet despite us all looking forward to this for some time. After they left, my Wife and I felt a bit insecure and wondered if they actually had a good time despite them mentioning that they enjoyed it. \n\nAnyone else experience something similar when hosting friends as adults?

For one concert, it is going to be at the shore - the rest of the day can be enjoyed in the beach and enjoying the boardwalk and all the games, shops, and food. Another concert is in the complete opposite direction but is in the same small city as an amusement park/zoo which will be another fun day. And as for the other possible concerts - well the metro I am a part of has quite a few and the perks for some of them is not even having to drive to get to them (and wanderinf around the city is always fun).\n\nWhat concerts are any of you planning on going to this year? Do you have an all-time favorite concert, or venue, that you like to go to?",
