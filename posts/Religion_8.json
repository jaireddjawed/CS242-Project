        "text": "One year ago today I experienced a spiritual event which altered the course of my life significantly. I was in the yard working on preparing our chicken run. \n\nGod told me when I was a teenager that he wanted me to help get our collective back on course. He showed me that the economic disparity which exists in our society is essentially the benchmark to gauge how healthy we truly are. I asked him how I was supposed to help change it because I could not wrap my head around how I would ever be able to make an impact on something like that. He said to just be myself and that I would know when it was time, he also told me to listen when he would lead me. \n\nThis guidance would typically come in the form of what is commonly referred to as the \"Holy Spirit\" with feeling the energy associated with it or having an idea come in and knowing it to be truth, however I have heard a voice on a few occasions. I usually do not speak of this, because I know the negative connotations associated with hearing voices. \n\nThe voice was heard strong and loud and led me to winning a car. This was after a series of vehicle trades were made where I essentially traded even or down. The vehicles were exactly what the other people were needing at that moment. \n\nGod wanted me to start listening to the local Christian radio station again, after over a decade long abstinence. A few days later I was on my way to work and they came on the radio and said \"Caller number 9 to win…\" I was arrogant enough that I remember thinking there's nothing they'd be giving away that I would want. \"...a chance to win a new car\". I changed my tune and picked up the phone and called a couple of times and got a busy signal. I sat my phone down and then heard a voice loud and clear that stated \"Try one more time\". I was familiar with the energy associated with the voice because of a lifelong relationship. So, I picked up the phone and called again. This time it started to ring and then someone answered and said \"You are caller number 9!\"\n\nI got the 93rd entry out of 94 they were giving out. The giveaway was two days later. I went through some of the worst spiritual warfare of my life (up to that point) the night leading to the giveaway, almost to the point that I didn't drive the 1.5 hours to even attend. Obviously, I ended up going and they gave everyone a raffle ticket and when they drew your number you got to go up and pick a key in an envelope and then try to open a lock. I watched for two hours while people went ahead of me, I was the 80th person to pick an envelope. I went up and lined them up in a row and went down the line and touched them and went to draw one and heard the voice sternly say \"Not that one, keep going.\" I kept going and then hit one and heard it say \"That one\". I picked up the envelope and pulled out the key and then it was almost like I was watching myself through tunnel vision as I opened the lock. \n\nI don't tell this story to brag. I believe that God gave me this experience to share with people. I also believe that he gave me this experience to direct me down a specific path and so that I would listen again when the time came. \n\nNow, back to one year ago. I knew that the answer was linked to a way to limit the economic disparity, but everything I had come across had fatal flaws. I had recently watched the newer Star Trek movie and was thinking about the scene where Spock helped Scotty with his transwarp equation. He said \"Imagine that! It never occurred to me to think of SPACE as the thing that was moving!\" and then I realized that if we change the way we determine income tax rates to use the lowest paid employee's salary as the divisor to determine tax rates within each company that it would scale automatically and indefinitely while tying the welfare of the lowest paid employee to everyone else in the company. \n\nIt felt like a spiritual nerve had been ripped open. I could see and feel connections that I had never experienced before. It was beautiful and terrifying at the same time. I had to go inside and start writing so I would not forget, because I don't have the best memory. I laid out the details at www.pauseforthecause.com on how I could see things being handled to address any pitfalls associated with the change. \n\nShortly after, I was also directed to register the domain www.alldenominations.com with the message there. This led me to a desire for a fuller spiritual understanding of what had happened to me and to see if anyone else had experienced anything similar. \n\nIt took weeks for the feeling of the raw spiritual nerve to subside. It was a bit overwhelming… \n\nHere is a summary of my findings over the past year, regarding spiritual matters. \n\nIn the beginning we were all with God, who is the source of all existence. We are more than this flesh, our souls exist as energy and are eternal, but we are not God. \n\nGod created a paradise that is commonly referred to as \"Heaven\". Where there is no suffering, however we were oblivious to what suffering was… God told us that we could stay there and enjoy everything there is to offer. \n\nHe told us that the only rule was to not eat from the \"tree of knowledge\", because then we would know good and evil. By giving us this commandment, he gave us a simple choice as to follow the rules or not. By consuming the fruit, we willingly accepted this spiritual journey. This is why people believe in the \"original sin\".\n\nWe live as multiple beings throughout this journey to gain the perspective needed for \"Heaven\" to exist alongside free will. As we progress spiritually, we exist as different beings with different capabilities. The beings who exist in the higher spiritual planes have more authority (some people call these entities \"gods\"), however, if we abuse our form then we essentially move down (descend) in planes during our next existence. \n\nThink about it like a pair of escalators. On the left hand side, you have one that is moving down towards the realm of the flesh where pain and suffering exist more prevalently. This is used when you make a majority of choices that are geared towards the flesh and go against God's optimal path. On the right hand side you have one that goes up towards the spiritual realm. This is used when you make a majority of choices that are geared towards the spirit and towards God's optimal path. We all take this journey at our own pace, it is up to us if we choose to make fleshly or spiritual choices. As our souls ascend to a higher plane, free will does not disappear, we just choose to make better choices. \n\nAs we begin to better understand and reconcile with our role and more people start advancing through their spiritual journey, as a collective, we start to see the positive effects on society. As this happens, the number of spiritually enlightened people grows. So peace and harmony continues to grow over time, but as with all things, there are ebbs and flows and cycles…. \n\nOnce this reaches \"critical mass\" and then starts to descend, you start to see negative influences growing in society. As the spiritually enlightened continue on to the next portion of their journey, it leaves behind those who choose to not listen, or grow and progress with the rest of us… This leads to an increase in pain and suffering caused by the hands of humans. \n\nGod gave us the 10 Commandments for simplification, we just have a tendency to over complicate things. They are to act as a guide for us to follow. If an interpretation of God's will contradicts them, then it is usually a pretty good indicator that they have misunderstood. \n\nThere is a lot of commentary of what people believe to be what God wants us to do or not do, but what does arguing about the past actually accomplish? We can't change what has already happened in the past, but we are in control of what will happen in our future. It is up to us to make those decisions. \n\nDo not blindly trust anyone. There is only one authority… If you truly take the time to develop your own personal relationship with God, then he will guide you along his optimal path for you. However, it is still your choice. \n\nWith that being said, I asked God for guidance on my role. I am Benjamin Joseph. I do not seek glory for myself, only for God (our father), and I am doing my part to enact God's optimal will for all of our society. \n\nI do not have all the answers, however I am open to attempt to answer any questions about the spiritual event, proposed plan or my spiritual journey.",

I had been dealing with a lot of OCD lately, and when i encountered a thought a bit of time back I decided to give it a one last shot, I told myself that I will wait till Shivratri, to see if Shiva does really bless me, If he did, I would stop performing the compulsions and focus on getting better and if he didn't, I would do the compulsions next morning, Basically I just tried to delay the compulsion for the time being. I had set a condition into my mind, now it may sound silly and stupid but I really love cats, so I wished that If Shiva does see me, and does watch over me and protect me with anxiety, Then i should encounter a cat and that I'm able to pet him\n\nThis may sound really silly and stupid and also coincidental, but this was what came to my mind, Today evening when I went out to perform the puja of Mahashivratri, a cat magically appeared out of nowhere and I did pet him (Since cats do not like being pet). And this is how i feel Lord Shiva does look out for me and he doesn't want me to perform my compulsions\n\nI'm sorry if this sounds too stupid to be true, but I really felt happiness in a long time knowing that the Lord of The Universe watches over me. Let's together work for the service of others in the name of Lord Shiva!\n\nHAR HAR MAHADEV!",

A human is \"created in the image of God\" in the fundamental sense of being, like God, a first-person subjectively experiencing experience that has visual and tactile experience of having a \"body\" or \"animal body\" that degrades and eventually dies, which in Pantheopsychic Theology is not cessation of the existence of consciousness (for those that replicate the experiences of God) but transformation into a higher state of being that replicates the experiences of God outside the Crucifixion, which is the source of any and all evil (defined by James H. Dee as \"natural and deliberate evil\", i.e. evil delineated into malice or perniciousness \\[accidental or natural harm\\]).\n\nIf Universalism, the Christian doctrine that everyone, including Satan and his demons and even the worst human psychopaths, will be eventually saved according to lobotomizing in the process of ultimate Apocatastasis is true, even Satan, demons, and human psychopaths are God-Replicants.  If the Christian doctrine of Annihilationism or Annihilism (for short) is true, only humans that replicate the previous experiences of God in one of three personalities and states of consciousness (the source of all negative experiences that shall ever be experienced by those that replicate God's content of consciousness derived from the incarnation of God in Pantheopsychism called \"The Crucified Man\") are fundamentally and fatefully immortal, with every being that does not replicate God's previous experience mortal, including Satan, and are doomed to a sort of \"quasi-atheistic\" death, i.e. cessation of existence of consciousness.  Given in Pantheopsychism there is no such thing as coming into or going out of existence but only *transformation* (*a la*  the First Law of Thermodynamics but for *consciousness or subjective experience*, as physical energy and matter do not exist), the \"going out of existence\" for Satan and all other non-God-Replicants means the transformation of their person consciousness into the objective consciousness of the saved, i.e. a saved person's perception of objects, such that the wicked are \"recycled\" from being persons to be others' perceptions of (heavenly) objects.\n\nBut this is, in the end, a hypothesis of the nature of reality, one that might be true for all anyone can know.\n\nJay M. Brewer\n\nPantheopsychic Philosopher\n\nAustin, Texas",

        "text": "^CW: ^this ^post ^does ^mention ^some ^disturbing ^topics, ^including ^child ^abuse, ^religious ^violence, ^sexual ^assault, ^torture, ^lynchings, ^and ^judicial ^executions \n\nThese incidents are especially common in countries like Nigeria, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola, Tanzania, and Papua New Guinea, but they are alarmingly common throughout much of Africa and Melanesia, and in various parts of Asia, Central Europe, and the Americas. \n\nBetween 1960 and the year 2000, it's estimated that more than 40,000 people in Tanzania alone were murdered due to the belief that they were \"witches;\" thousands more have been killed in similar incidents spanning more than a dozen other countries (and several different continents). \n\nIn the last 100 years, in fact, it's estimated that there have been hundreds of thousands of deaths related to these allegations of \"witchcraft,\" while millions more have been persecuted in other significant ways -- being subjected to mob violence, being imprisoned, being tortured, raped, and/or starved, being physically branded, being beaten, being flogged, having limbs forcibly amputated, suffering arson attacks, being disowned/abandoned by family members, being banished (or having to flee) from the community, having land and/or property stolen, being denied access to education, employment, housing, and/or healthcare, losing custody of children and/or watching as their children are ostracized and punished in similar ways (because they are viewed as the offspring of a \"witch\") etc. Countless people are currently suffering as a result of these practices. \n\nBut the really shocking part is that this issue *is only getting worse* -- it's continuing to grow and spread into different parts of the world, facilitated by the destabilizing effects of the pandemic and all of the escalating economic, environmental, and political crises, along with the growing popularity of fundamentalist sects within both Christianity and Islam. As a result, acts of violence targeting \"witches\" continue to become increasingly normalized (and are occuring with greater frequency) throughout much of the world. The legal persecution of so-called \"witches\" by government entities has also become more popular. \n\nSome examples of the incidents that have occurred as a result of these beliefs:\n\n- Experts believe that most of the 25,000 to 50,000 children who live on the streets of Kinshasa (the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo) were originally abandoned because their families believed that they were \"witches.\" Many of these children were still just infants when they were abandoned. \n\n- The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also home to thousands of churches/pastors who are known to perform exorcisms on alleged \"witches\" for financial profit (the same pastors are usually the ones who identify these \"witches\" in the first place). In 2005, the government of the DRC passed new legislation making it illegal to accuse minors of practicing witchcraft, but this legislation is almost never enforced, and it has been estimated (according to reports from both the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and Human Rights Watch) that as many as 50,000 children, having been identified as \"witches,\" may still be imprisoned in religious buildings throughout the DRC, where they await \"deliverance ceremonies\" (i.e. exorcisms) in which they often face abuse, violence, torture, and sometimes even death under the pretext of spiritual cleansing. \n\n- In many cases, children who have endured these \"deliverance ceremonies\" at churches in the DRC have been left with serious injuries, including permanent blindness, because the ceremony often involves pouring chemicals like chlorine bleach, gasoline, or battery acid directly into the child's eyes; in other cases, the children are forced to *ingest* chlorine bleach, gasoline, or battery acid, leaving them either gravely ill or fatally wounded. During a similar \"deliverance ceremony\" in Angola, a man used a syringe to inject battery acid directly into his young son's stomach in an effort to \"exorcise\" the evil from him, leaving the boy gravely injured. Some of these children are also permanently disfigured after suffering serious chemical burns from having caustic/toxic substances like battery acid or chlorine bleach poured over their faces. \n\n- Some other tactics that are often deployed during the \"deliverance ceremonies\" that occur in places like the DRC, Angola, and Nigeria include branding or burning the child, chaining them up and securing them inside a room for days at a time, depriving them of food/water, cutting them, beating them, and/or forcing them to drink putrid concoctions with ingredients like blood, feces, dirt, urine, and noxious chemicals. \n\n- The fees that are charged during these ceremonies are also exorbitantly expensive, usually costing more than what most local families would make in an entire *year*...so when the financial cost of the \"deliverance ceremony\" is more than what the family can afford, when there is no one in the community who is actually *willing* to pay for it, or when the child has no immediate family to begin with, then it is extremely common for the children in question to be abandoned, banished, or simply killed. \n\n\n- In Ghana, a series of settlements known as \"witch camps\" have been established to provide shelter/safety to women who have been branded as \"witches;\" many of these women are widows with small children, and the children are often sheltered in the camps alongside their mothers. It is estimated that these camps currently house between 1,000 and 2,500 women in total, along with hundreds of children. Some women have been residing in these camps for more than 40 years. \n\n- In India, records indicate that more than 2,500 people who were accused of practicing \"witchcraft\" were captured, tortured, and killed between the years 2000 and 2016. \n\n- In the Limpopo Province of South Africa, more than 600 so-called \"witches\" were killed between the years 1996 and 2001. \n\n- When a wave of \"witch-hunts\" swept through East Java (Indonesia) in 1998, more than 200 people were killed over the course of just a few months. \n\n- From 2010 to 2011, more than 20 elderly women were hacked to death in Zimbabwe as a result of similar allegations. \n\n- In 2008, the Gambian government imprisoned 1,000 alleged \"witches\" in a detention center, where they were tortured and forced to consume a dangerous hallucinogenic concoction. \n\n- In 2007, more than 200 suspected \"witches\" were murdered within a single province in Papua New Guinea. \n\n- Reports indicate that thousands of women in the Indian state of Jharkand are formally accused of practicing \"witchcraft\" each month, and that hundreds of these women are then beaten, tortured, and/or killed. Many of the women are instead subjected to scenes of public humiliation, however; some are forcibly stripped naked and paraded before the rest of the village, while others have their heads forcibly shaved in public, and some are forced to eat excrement. In some of the more violent cases that are routinely observed in Jharkand, women who have been accused of \"witchcraft\" may also have their eyes gouged out, and some are set on fire. \n\n- In May of 2008, 15 women in a single region of Kenya were set on fire and executed by an angry mob; the women had all been accused of practicing \"sorcery.\" \n\n- In recent years, at least five different individuals have been officially executed by the government of Saudi Arabia on charges of practicing \"sorcery;\" other purported \"sorcerers\" have been tried and convicted in Saudi Arabia, though some have received public floggings (and other forms of torture) instead of the death penalty, and others are currently in prison awaiting trial. Saudi also has the dubious distinction of having an official, state-sponsored \"Witch-hunting Task Force.\" \n\nThese violent attacks on so-called \"witches\" continue to spread in both rural and urban population centers; some of the most significantly affected countries include Nigeria, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Angola, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Micronesia, and Vanuatu, with frequent attacks also occurring in countries like South Africa, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Haiti. Over the last 50 years, several similar incidents were sporadically documented in Poland, too. This form of violence has been on the rise for several decades now. \n\nI think it goes without saying that there is no simple, one-size-fits-all explanation for all of these incidents. There are lots of different factors that may converge in order to produce this kind of violence, including things like interpersonal conflict, economic rivalry, traditional folklore, poverty, environmental strife (e.g. drought or famine), lack of resources, inadequate access to education, unexplained illnesses, the desire to uphold homogeneity, misogyny, socio-political imperatives, and/or the promotion of religious rhetoric -- essentially the same factors that have *always* contributed to the witch-hunt phenomenon. \n\nBut there are some interesting trends occuring in the cases from Africa and Melanesia, where violent attacks against \"witches\" are especially prevalent -- it's clear that these acts of violence are often intertwined with a particularly toxic blend of Evangelical rhetoric, traditional spiritualism, and socio-economic instability. \n\nIn Nigeria, for example, popular Pentecostal preachers like Helen Ukpabio have explicitly promoted the belief in \"child witches,\" and these pastors have encouraged the parents of the accused \"witches\" to subject their children to the cruel, abusive, and often violent exorcism rituals that are offered by local preachers (for an enormous fee). \n\nFrom *The Telegraph:* \n\n&gt; The devil's children are \"identified\" by powerful religious leaders at extremist churches where Christianity and traditional beliefs have combined to produce a deep-rooted belief in, and fear of, witchcraft. The priests spread the message that child-witches bring destruction, disease and death to their families. And they say that, once possessed, children can cast spells and contaminate others. \n\n&gt; The religious leaders offer help to the families whose children are named as witches, but at a price. The churches run exorcism, or \"deliverance\", evenings where the pastors attempt to drive out the evil spirits. Only they have the power to cleanse the child of evil spirits, they say. The exorcism costs the families up to a year's income. \n\n&gt; During the \"deliverance\" ceremonies, the children are shaken violently, dragged around the room and have potions poured into their eyes. The children look terrified. The parents look on, praying that the child will be cleansed. If the ritual fails, they know their children will have to be sent away, or killed. Many are held in churches, often on chains, and deprived of food until they \"confess\" to being a witch. \n\n&gt; The ceremonies are highly lucrative for the spiritual leaders, many of whom enjoy a lifestyle of large homes, expensive cars and designer clothes. Some Nigerians blame the increase on one of the country's wealthiest and most influential evangelical preachers. Helen Ukpabio, a self-styled prophetess of the 150-branch Liberty Gospel Church, made a film, widely distributed, called End of the Wicked. It tells, in graphic detail, how children become possessed and shows them being inducted into covens, eating human flesh and bringing chaos and death to their families and communities. \n\n&gt; Mrs Ukpabio ... also wrote a popular book which tells parents how to identify a witch. **For children under two years old, she says, the key signs of a servant of Satan are crying and screaming in the night, high fever and worsening health - symptoms that can be found among many children in an impoverished region with poor health care.** \n\nIt's interesting to note that these religious beliefs/cultural trends are relatively new to Nigeria (and they're new to most other African societies, too). This is something that has no precedent within the local culture, but has instead evolved from the modern rise of religious fundamentalism, the spread of Evangelical theology, widespread instability and inequality, and traditional beliefs about spiritualistic entities/forces. \n\nIt seems like there is an inherent volatility that arises when Evangelical beliefs concerning spiritual warfare, Satan, and strife come into contact with communities that are already in crisis. The widespread uncertainty and devastation within these communities is framed as a direct consequence of Satanic influences that have arisen from *within* the community itself, manifesting in the form of a real/physical person...and the most vulnerable people are then quickly singled out and blamed. They are viewed as Satanic emissaries who are directly responsible for causing tragedies within the community (e.g. the unexplained death of a local child, a fatal accident, a devastating famine, the outbreak of a deadly disease, poverty, etc.) which means that the accused \"witch\" must be punished and purged. \n\nMore of the details about the practices that occur during the Nigerian \"deliverance ceremonies:\" \n\n&gt; ... at his church in Ibaka, the Bishop pours a homemade substance called African mercury, a potion of pure alcohol and his own blood, into the eyes of a young boy lying on a table. \"I want this poison destroyer to destroy the witch right now, in Jesus' name,\" he says. \n\n&gt; And according to Sam Itauma, a Nigerian man who runs a youth shelter to help care for children who have been abused and/or abandoned as \"witches:\" \n\n&gt; \"If you are not rich and don't have anything to eat, you look to blame someone. And if you don't get anything, you blame it on the witches.\" \n\nSimilar circumstances are at play in Melanesia -- especially in Papua New Guinea, where extreme Pentecostal rhetoric has likewise interacted with existing conditions to encourage the (often violent) persecution of alleged \"witches.\" \n\nFrom *Introduction to Pentecostal Witchcraft and Spiritual Politics in Africa and Melanesia:* \n\n&gt; ... a mob in Papua New Guinea burned alive a young mother, Kepari Leniata, 20, who was suspected of sorcery. This highly publicized case followed a series of instances over recent years of lethal group violence against women and men accused of witchcraft. \n\n&gt; In 1992, a well-orchestrated upsurge of third wave evangelism and apocalyptic thinking took off in the Mountain Ok area, which had a considerable influence on people’s lives and thinking. Jorgensen (2005) specifically addresses a local movement called “Operation Joshua” and the centrality of “spiritual warfare” within it. **The focus of this movement was to attack directly invisible evil forces such as witchcraft and sorcery through “spiritual mapping,” “healing,” and “crusades.” Through this confrontational, aggressive, and effective form of evangelism numerous charismatic movements and campaigns found their way into PNG, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.** \n\n&gt; During an intensive period in 2014, the entire Christian congregation of the small island of Ahamb in Vanuatu came out of their church building and besieged every corner of their island in order to drive out demons and evil spirits. It culminated in a witch hunt, where people of the congregation ganged up on accused witches, and in the end killed them by hanging them in the community hall. All this activity relates to Joel Robbins’s (2009) point that Pentecostalism is marked by an intense preoccupation with ritual—to the degree that ritual cleansing overflows church boundaries and becomes concerned with all social life.  \n\nAnd the role of Pentecostal rhetoric in both regions: \n\n&gt; ... the demonization of children also highlights the crucial role played in the persecution of ‘witches’ by the Christian Pentecostal sects that have proliferated in urban and rural Africa during the last\ntwenty years. While a full analysis of Pentecostalism – taking into account its role in the globalization process and its evolution in the course of the 1980s and 1990s – remains to be written, **the connection between Pentecostalism and the persecution of witches is well documented, possibly providing a clue to the rapid expansion of witch-hunting in so many different parts of the planet.** Ogembo discusses the role of Pentecostalists in the spree of witch killings that occurred in Kenya’s Gusii province during the early 1990s, noting that **with their emphasis on the devil and exorcism, Pentecostalists latched onto Gusii indigenous beliefs about mystical\nforces and powers. Through books and open-air sermons in market centers and other public spaces, evangelists increased people’s anxiety about their social environment, preached a connection between\nSatan, illness and death and incited a spiritual warfare of sorts.** \n\n&gt; The crux of Pentecostal universalism seems to lie in its handling of witchcraft or demons. **Spiritual warfare is the Christian version of taking a stand against invisible evil forces. The foundation for this ideology is the belief that evil spirits intervene in human affairs, and this is as relevant to the movement in the context of the USA or Scandinavia as it is in Africa or Melanesia. However, Pentecostal universalism has taken inspiration from experiences in non-Western settings.** \n\n&gt; ... when a congress on world evangelization was held in Manila in 1989, with thousands of participants from across the world, the three most attended workshops were on the Holy Spirit and spiritual warfare. Another member of this group, Ed Murphy , a former missionary in Latin America, explains their general attitude as follows: \n\n&gt; \"We are at war. As to the origin of this war, all we know is what the Bible tells us. It began in the cosmic realm, evidently before the creation of man, in an angelic rebellion against the Lordship of God.\nThe experienced deliverance minister can compel evil spirits to tell the truth. I do so all the time. We obtain from them the information we need to proceed with the deliverance and then expel them to the place where Jesus wishes to send them.\nWe need to condition ourselves, so to speak, to put on our spiritual warfare eyeglasses to correctly view present reality.\" \n\n&gt; Such evangelism proceeds by building universal examples from situations in parts of the world where witchcraft and forces of the invisible dominate people’s daily lives. **The examples are fed into in a systematic global struggle against the demonic. The demonic, as well as the warfare against it, is presented as an ontological starting point, where Pentecostal energy is dedicated to discerning the presence of Satan in social life anywhere. This always takes place as a war with competing ontological regimes—of science, reason, and the state.** \n\nI just wanted to share some of this, particularly the articles/papers listed below, because I don't think that there are many people outside of the affected regions who are really aware of the fact that these incidents are becoming more widespread...and that it actually seems to be getting worse. And I think these interactions between religious rhetoric, folklore, and poverty/strife in general are really interesting (and often alarming). \n\n#Some additional info/sources (please be advised that these articles may contain some disturbing content): \n\n- New York Times: [The Persecution of Witches, 21st Century Style](https://www.archive.ph/U24hM) \n\n- BBC: [Branded and Beaten - the children accused of witchcraft and murder](https://www.bbc.com/news/resources/idt-sh/nigeria_children_witchcraft) \n\n- Reuters: [Killing of Women, Child \"Witches\" is on the Rise, U.N.

I am not here to debate, just to learn how others think. \n\n**1-** I just want you to assume for a second that God exists as he describes himself in the Islamic faith. How do you rationalise saying these sentences? \n\n\\- \"So what if God exists? I ain't worshiping him for xxx reasons\"\n\n\\- \"Your God is a xxx for letting xxx happen and I'd never even want to submit to him even if he really existed\"\n\n\\- \"If God exists, and he is as malevolent as he is shown in the (insert religious book here), then I'd rather burn in hell than worship him\"\n\n\\- \"So you're worshiping God out of fear? How is that gonna lead to a healthy relationship? I'd rather xxx than worship your God\"\n\netc...\n\nThis also applies to that popular saying that tells you to just lead a good life, if God is good, he'd reward you, and if he's bad, he wasn't worthy of your worship anyways.\n\n**2-** If by some miracle you wake up tomorrow 100% sure that Islam is true (Don't question it, it's a hypothetical situation). Will your negative thoughts about Islam prevent you from being a Muslim to avoid Hellfire? Or will you still rebel against God?",

        "text": "Hello! I have come across some books that I would like to ask this sub in helping me figure what in them is and isn't true. Specifically, based upon their descriptions on Amazon. The descriptions read....\n\n1)  INSCRIBED UPON THE CROSS WHEN JESUS WAS CRUCIFIED were the latin  words \"Jesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum.\" Pontius Pilate was the author of  that famous inscription. Latin was Pontius Pilate's mother tongue.  Authorities competent to translate and pass upon the correct translation  into English agree that is \"Jesus the Nazarene Ruler of the Judeans.\"  There is no disagreement among them of that. THE WORD \"JEW\" did not  occur anywhere in the English Language until the 18th Century. Jesus  referred to himself as a Judean. The modern day \"Jews\" were historically  Khazars or Chazars, a Mongolian Nordic tribe who roamed northern  Europe. \n\n2) In the ancient times and land of the Bible, over 3700 years ago,  Rebekah, the wife of the patriarch Issac, was informed by God that she  would give birth to twins whose fate would be as diverse as their  character. The birth of these twins, Esau and Jacob, and their ensuing  destinies, would have the most profound impact on future events in the  world. This analysis of the history and prophesy of Esau and his  descendants will unveil many of the problems in this world, and will  bring a new perspective on wars and conflicts, Zionism, political  conspiracies, anti-Semitism, economic problems, and the Jewish issue.  This material will also explain why one group of people have made  concerted efforts for the establishment of hate laws, world government,  abortions, crime, interracial marriages, wars, deindustrialization, and  slavery. The ancient and pronounced struggle that prevailed between Esau  and Jacob still exists today and is causing the world to be turned  upside down. The question of, “Who is Esau-Edom,” undoubtedly involves  the most stupendous drama ever enacted in the annals of mankind. That  drama is presented here to help us better understand God’s plans for man  here on earth. \n\n(An additional review of the book whose citation is 2) reads: \"The  author of this book is right about the fake Jews (Askenaz Gomer) being  who they are as Zionists. But the Author is completely wrong about who  the natural branches are (Jacob/Yisra'el). The Israelites in the Bible  (Jacob) are a black race, not white Christians as the Author emphasizes a  lot. Not all black people are Israelites because the children of Ham  are black also, which are called Hamites/Ethiopians. White people were  never sold into slavery on slave ships, black people were, as was  prophesied in detail (see Deuteronomy 28 to name a few).  \n\n\nAmos 9:7 even points out that Israelites (Jacob) looks like Ethiopians.  \n\n\nGentiles are a white race of people as Japheth being their progenitor, Genesis 10 explains that fact.  \n\n\nAnd  America is not the New Jerusalem as this author tries to explain. The  land of America is just as corrupted as the rest of the earth.  \n\n\nThe  natural branches of Israel (Blacks/Hebrews) and the wild olive trees  (Gentiles) become one in Yahusha HaMashiach by their faith in Him. And  this how Israel is further populated (Romans 9, 10, 11).\n\n  \"As the author gives evidence of who Esau-Edom  \nis, he also give information on who he believes the Real Israelites are.  \nConstantly he says \"White Christains\" are the Israelites but this  \ncannot be true because \"White Christains\" do not fit the curses of  \nDeuteronomy 28. I would say take the meat and leave the bone on this  \none.\") \n\n3)  \"This book traces the history of the ancient Khazar Empire, a  \nmajor but almost forgotten power in Eastern Europe, which in the Dark  \nAges became converted to Judaism. Khazaria was finally wiped out by the  \nforces of Genghis Khan, but evidence indicates that the Khazars  \nthemselves migrated to Poland and formed the cradle of Western Jewry.    \nTo the general reader the Khazars, who flourished from the 7th to 11th  \ncentury, may seem infinitely remote today. Yet they have a close and  \nunexpected bearing on our world, which emerges as Koestler recounts the  \nfascinating history of the ancient Khazar Empire.  At about the time  \nthat Charlemagne was Emperor in the West. The Khazars' sway extended  \nfrom the Black Sea to the Caspian, from the Caucasus to the Volga, and  \nthey were instrumental in stopping the Muslim onslaught against  \nByzantium, the eastern jaw of the gigantic pincer movement that in the  \nWest swept across northern Africa and into Spain.  Thereafter the  \nKhazars found themselves in a precarious position between the two major  \nworld powers: the Eastern Roman Empire in Byzantium and the triumphant  \nfollowers of Mohammed.  As Koestler points out, the Khazars were the  \nThird World of their day. They chose a surprising method of resisting  \nboth the Western pressure to become Christian and the Eastern to adopt  \nIslam. Rejecting both, they converted to Judaism.   Mr. Koestler  \nspeculates about the ultimate faith of the Khazars and their impact on  \nthe racial composition and social heritage of modern Jewry. He produces  \ndetailed research to support a theory which could make the term  \n'anti-Semitism' become void of meaning.\" \n\n(And an additional review of the book whose description is 3) reads: \"The  \nbottom line is there is no archaeological evidence for a Jewish conversion by Khazars; no Jewish Khazar cemeteries, no mikvas of Biblical proportions, no synagogues for communal prayer, no ritual objects, no Jewish text in the Khazar language - NOTHING..  The book is fiction\" \n\nWhat is and isn't true from the text I copied-and-pasted above? It's all alot to take in, and I was hesitant to ask this sub at first, but decided to. I also am not linking to the books themselves on Amazon, but you should be able to find them via copying-and-pasting the texts above. I look forward to any replies and sorting through what's bs about the text above... of which, I imagine a lot (of the text) is.",

        "text": "Protestants tried to get rid of tradition for a \"purer\" form of Christianity. This is kind of odd considering that Jewish people still appreciate the Oral Torah tradition as important, and it is understandable Catholics also saw Tradition as authoritative in the same fashion. So that idea of getting rid of tradition seems to be too extreme, and although Jesus criticized some traditions, He did not encourage his followers to get rid of it.\n\nThis idea of getting rid of tradition is not new either. Bishop Marcion tried to teach a Gentle Christianity totally clean of Jewish traditions and focus solely on Jesus as God, while protestants today actually do the opposite and find Jewish origins as more authoritative than Hellenism. It would have been interesting to have an almost purely Greek Golden Christianity without Old Testament, basically a totally new religion vaguely inspired by the Jewish God. Sadly, that was not very popular. In that world, Jews would not be mad that Christians appropriated their beliefs, and also Gentiles would have their own original ideas and traditions of God, no boomer Evangelicals favoring unjustified public money for Israel and Zionism, etc. Sure, Gnostics seem to have tried that to an extreme and even called YHWH a demon god, but their beliefs never standardized and never took roots in Christendom. At the end, the team for Christianity keeping the Jewish roots, won, for the good and the bad.\n\nThe fact the New Testament avoid details about rituals seem to suggest that it expects itself to rely on Tradition. However, this also opened freedom for Christians to make their own traditions and rituals.",

Personally, I find that taking a deep breath and saying \"You got this, be strong\" or \"imagine how you would feel in that situation\" to myself does the trick, but different strokes for different folks.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/114ki0m/the_old_testaments_ethical_perspective_when_it/",
        "text": "The relationship that the Old Testament has with atrocities is an interesting and important one. Often times in our modern culture we see the Old Testament as being synonymous with atrocities. The truth is much more complicated than that. In the Old Testament's ethics surrounding war what we see is a complex understanding of the nature and conduct of war that sits side by side with a humanitarian desire for social justice. We also see the reality of atrocities being presented for different literary purposes and reasons. In presenting this, this is going to be a fairly long OP so if people don't want to read this they can skip this. Here are a couple of points that outline the Old Testament's attitude to atrocities in war:\n\n**(1)Atrocities in war: Explicit condemnations in the Old Testament.**\n\n* I thought I would start this off by giving explicit vs implicit condemnations of atrocities that take place in war during the Old Testament. Throughout this this is going to include as many extensive quotations from the text as well as reflections. So here are examples of this:\n* \"*Then the slaughtered every male there, including Hamor and his son Shechem. They killed them with their swords, then they too Dinah from Shechem's house and returned to their camp. Meanwhile the rest of Jacob's sons arrived. Finding the men slaughtered they plundered the town because their sister had been defiled there. They seized all the flocks and herds and donkeys-everything they could lay their hands on, both inside the town and outside in the fields. They looted all their wealth and plundered their houses. Thy also took all their little children and wives and led them away as captives. Afterwards Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, 'You have ruined me! You've made me* ***stink*** *among all the people of this land-among all the Canaanites and Perizzites*\"(Genesis 34:25-30)\n* \"*Simeon and Levi are two of a kind their weapons are instruments of violence. May I never join in their meetings; may I never be a party to their plans.For in their anger* ***they murdered men,and they crippled oxen just for sport***.*A curse on their anger, for it is fierce; a curse on their wrath, for it is cruel. I will scatter them among the descendants of Jacob;I will disperse them throughout Israel*\"(Genesis 49:5-7)\n* \"*There was a famine during David's reign that lasted for three years, so David asked the Lord about it. And the Lord said, '****The famine has come because Saul and his family are guilty of murdering the Gibeonites****'. So the king summoned the Gibeonites. They were not part of Israel but were all that was left of the nation of the Amorites. They people of Israel had sworn not to kill them,* ***but Saul, in his zeal for Israel and Judah, had tried to wipe them out***\"(2 Samuel 21:1-2)\n* \"*The armies of Israel captured 200,000 women and children from Judah and seized tremendous amounts of plunder, which they took back to Samaria. But a prophet of the Lord named Oded was there in Samaria when the army of Israel returned home. He went out to meet them and said 'The Lord, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah and let you defeat them.* ***But you have gone too far, killing them without mercy and all heaven is disturbed***. *And now you are planning to make slaves of these people from Judah and Jerusalem. What about your own sins against the Lord your God? Listen to me and return these prisoners you have taken, for they are your own relatives. Watch out, because now the Lord's fierce anger has been turned against you!' Then some of Israel's leaders.....agreed with this and confronted the men returning from battle. 'You must not bring the prisoners here!' they declared. 'We cannot afford to add to our sins and guilt. Our guilt is already great and the Lord's fierce anger is already turned against Israel*'. ***So the warriors released the prisoners and handed over the plunder in the sight of the leaders and all the people. Then the four men just mentioned by name came forward and distributed cloths from the plunder to the prisoners who were naked. They provided clothing and sandals to wear, gave them enough food and drink, and dressed their wounds with olive oil***. *They put those who were weak on donkeys and took all the prisoners back to Jericho*\"(2 Chronicles 28:8-15)\n* \"*This is what the Lord says: The people of Ammon have sinned again and again, and* ***I will not let them go unpunished***\\*\\*. *When they attacked Gilead to extend their borders\\** ***they ripped open pregnant women with their swords***\\*\\*. So i will send fire on the walls of Rabbah and all its fortresses will be destroyed\\*\\*\\*\"(Amos 1:13-14)\n* More could be mentioned but these are major ones that have a lot to say when it comes to social justice and humanitarianism in a war time context. The passage from Genesis for instance where Jacob says that they have made the house of Jacob \"stink\" in the land because of the atrocities committed has lot of resonances even today where the image of leaders and institutions, political or religious are often times ruined because of atrocities committed in their name. The story of Chronicles also has a lot of power in it where it speaks of the atrocities their causing \"heaven to be disturbed\". So when atrocities happen, it disturbs heaven itself.\n\n**(2)Atrocities in War: Implicit condemnations in the Old Testament**\n\n* While there are explicit condemnations in the Old Testament, there are implicit ones as well that also have interesting themes and motifs in them. These are the following where you see this:\n* \"*So they asked 'Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we assembled in the presence of the Lord?' And they discovered that no one from Jabesh-gilead had attended the assembly. For after they counted all the people, no one from Jabesh-gilead was present. So the assembly sent 12000 of their best warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to* ***kill everyone there, including women and children. 'This is what you are to do' they said. 'Completely destroy all the males and every woman who is not a virgin'***\\*\\*. Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found 400 young virgins who had never slept with a man and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.....\\*\\****In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes***\"(Judges 21:10-12/25)\n* \"*You will surely die Ahimelech, along with your entire family!' the King shouted. And he ordered his body guards, 'kill these priests of the Lord, for they are allies and conspirators with David! They knew he was running away from me, but they didn't tell me!'.* ***But Saul's men refused to kill the Lord's priests***\\*\\*\\*. Then the king said to Doeg, 'You do it'. So Doeg the Edomite turned on them and killed them that day, eighty five priests in all, still wearing their priestly garments.\\*\\* ***Then he went to Nob, the town of priests and killed the priests families-men and women, children and babies*** *and all the cattle, donkeys, sheep and goats*\"(1 Samuel 22:16-19)\n* \"*At that time Menahem destroyed the town of Tappuah and all the surrounding countryside as far as Tirzah, because its citizens refused to surrender the town.* ***He killed the entire population and ripped open the pregnant women***. *Menahem son of Gadi began to rule over Israel in the thirty-ninth year of King Uzziah's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria ten years. But Menahem did what was* ***evil*** *in the Lord's sight*\"(2 Kings 15:16-18)\n* These sets of passages have interesting and connecting themes here in their implicit condemnations of atrocities. In the chapter from Judges, which I presented in edited form, it ends by saying \"they did what seemed right in their own eyes\". In other words, this is what happens when you chooses what is morally correct in your own subjective eyes, rather than the eyes of God and his commandments. Furthermore since it comes at the end of Judges, it is presenting the spiritual and moral decline of Israel as a nation. In Kings, there is a succession crisis in the monarchy of the Northern tribes and to gain the thrown Menahem commits atrocities. Just like Judges, this is seen as representing the spiritual and moral decline of Israel preceding the Assyrian invasion. The distinction is this. Judges is presented in a context where there is no King. Kings is presented where there is a King. In the story of 1 Samuel we see just like 2 Kings an atrocities taking place by the ruling monarch. And just like 2 Kings its a sign of decline. In the case of Saul, a decline in his reign morally and spiritually. A distinctive of this though is when the orders to carry out an atrocity are given, his men refuse in an act of civil disobedience.\n\n**(3)The atrocities and its relationship to lamenting**\n\n* Throughout the Old Testament a common theme is theme of Lamenting. There is an entire book devoted to this called \"Lamentations\". Often times these laments are taking place in the context of atrocities taking place in war. The genre of lamenting itself speaks a lot because the definition of lamenting is to \"passionately grieve\". So we see expressions of passionate grief many times in the face of atrocities in the Old Testament. These are examples:\n* \"*Elisha stared at Hazael with a fixed gaze until Hazael became uneasy.* ***Then the man of God started weeping***\\*\\*. 'What's the matter my lord?' Hazael asked him. Elisha replied 'I know the\\*\\* ***terrible*** *things you will do to the people of Israel. You will* ***burn their cities, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground and rip open their pregnant women!***\"(2 Kings 8:11-12)\n* \"*Though he brings grief, he also shows compassion because of the greatness of his unfailing love. For he does not enjoy hurting people or causing them sorrow.* ***If people crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land, if they deprive others of their rights in defiance of the Most High, if they twist justice in the courts-doesn't the Lord see all these things***?\"(Lamentations 3:32-36)\n* \"***Tears*** *stream from my eyes because of the destruction of my people! My* ***tears flow endlessly***\\*\\*; they will not stop until until the Lord looks down from heaven and sees.\\*\\* ***My heart is breaking over the fate of all the women of Jerusalem***\"(Lamentations 3:48-51)\n* \"***Our enemies rape the women in Jerusalem and the young girls in all the towns of Judah***\\*. Our princes are being hanged by their thumbs, and our elders are treated with contempt. Young men are led away to work at millstones, and boys stagger under heavy loads of wood. The elders no longer sit in the city gates; the young men no longer dance and sing.\\* ***Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning***\"(Lamentations 5:11-15)\n* \"***The women of Moab are left like homeless birds at the shallow crossings of the Arnon River. 'Help us' they cry. 'Defend us against our enemies. Protect us from their relentless attack. Do not betray us now that we have escaped. Let our refugees stay among your until the terror is past***\\*'....Gone now is the gladness, gone the joy of the harvest. There will be no singing in the vineyards, no more happy shouts, no treading of grapes in the winepresses. I have ended all their harvests of joy.\\* ***My heart's cry for Moab is like a lament on a harp***\\*. I am filled with anguish for Kir-hareseth\\*.\"(Isaiah 16:2-4/10-11)\n\n**(4)Atrocities as a just cause for going to war**\n\n* Throughout the Biblical text we see reflections on when it is just to fight and go to war. Many of these occasions occur either at the command of God, or when a what is seen as a great atrocity is taking place. And in many instances they intersect(though not always). These are examples of this:\n* \"*Those Canaanites who lived long ago in your holy land were hated by you because of their detestable practises, their sorceries and their wicked rituals.* ***They mercilessly slaughtered their own children and feasted on sacrifices of human flesh and blood*** *during their pagan rituals.* ***You told our ancestors to destroy those parents who sacrificed innocent lives***\"(Wisdom of Solomon 12:3-6)\n* \"*Never forget what the Amalekites did to you as you came from Egypt.* ***They attacked you when you were exhausted and weary, and they struck down those who were straggling behind. They had no fear of God***\"(Deuteronomy 25:17-18)\n* \"*The King's secretaries were summoned and a decree was written exactly as Haman dictated. It was sent to the king's highest officers, the governors of the respective provinces, and the nobles of each province in their own scripts and languages. The decree was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king's signet ring. Dispatches were sent by swift messengers into all the provinces of the empire,* ***giving the order that all Jews-young and old, including women and children-must be killed, slaughtered and annihilated on a single day***\"(Esther 3:13)\n* \"*So on March 7 the two decrees of the king were put into effect. On that day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but quite the opposite happened. It was the Jews who overpowered their enemies.* ***The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the king's provinces to attack anyone who tried to harm them***\\*. *But no one could make a stand against for everyone was afraid of them\\**\"(Esther 9:1-2)\n* \"*The Levite, the husband of the woman who have been murdered said 'My concubine and I came to spend the night in Gibeah, a town that belongs to the people of Benjamin. That night some of the leading citizens of Gibeah surrounded the house, planning to kill me, and* ***they raped my concubine until she was dead.****...And all the people rose to their feet in unison and declared '****None of us will returned home! No, not even one of us! Instead, this is what we will do to Gibeah; we will draw lots to decide who will attack it****....The Israelites sent messengers to the tribe of Benjamin saying 'What terrible thing has been done among you!* ***Give up those evil men, those troublemakers from Gibeah, so that we can execute them and purge Israel of this evil'****. But the people of Benjamin would not listen. Instead they came from their towns and gathered at Gibeah to fight the Israelites....Israel had 400,000 experienced soldiers armed with swords...*\"(Judges 20:4-9/12-14;17)\n* We have hear acts that include rape, human and child sacrifice(mixed with cannibalism), attacking stragglers while they are weak, and resisting a genocidal decree in both passages in Esther. These are examples of atrocities that justify going to war for a just cause. And an interesting note is that the command in Deuteronomy around Amalek is connect to the story of Esther. Because Haman, the architect of this decree, is a descendant of Agag. Agag was the King of the Amalekites. Hence why in the Jewish liturgy at Purim this command in Deuteronomy is always read before the story of Esther.\n\n**(5)Harsh demands for accountability and justice for atrocities committed**\n\n* There are many instances where there is a harsh judgement and demand for justice for atrocities committed. And this demand is either executed by God himself or by human actors acting on his behalf. These are examples:\n* \"\\*Then Samuel said 'Bring King Agag to me'. Agag arrived full of hope, for he thought 'Surely the worst is over, and I have been spared!'. But Samuel said '\\****As your sword has killed the sons of many mothers, now your mother will be childless. And Samuel cut Agag to pieces before the Lord at Gilgal***\"(1 Samuel 15:32-33)\n* \"\\*David asked them 'What can I do for you? How ca I make amends so that you will bless the Lord's people again?' '**Well money can't settle this matter between us ad the family of Saul**' the Gibeonites replied. 'Neither can we demand the life of anyone in Israel'. 'What can I do them?' David asked. 'Just tell me and I will do it for you'. Then they replied 'It was Saul who planned to destroy us, to keep us from having any place in the territory of Israel. So let seven of Saul's sons be handed over to us, and we will execute them before the Lord at Gibeon, on the mountain of the Lord....\\****The men of Gibeon executed them on the mountain before the Lord....After that God ended the famine in the land***\"(2 Samuel 21:3-5;9;14)\n* \"*In that wonderful day when the Lord gives his people rest from sorrow and fear, from slavery and chains, you will taunt the king of Babylon. You will say......'Can this be the one who shook the earth and made the kingdoms of the world tremble? Is this the one who destroyed the world and made it into a wasteland? Is this the king who demolished the world's greatest cities and* ***had no mercy on his prisoners?****' 'The kings of the nations lie in stately glory, each in his own tomb,* ***but you will be thrown out of your grave like a worthless branch. Like a corpse trampled underfoot, you will be dumped into a mass grave with those killed in battle. You will descend to the pit***\"(Isaiah 14:3;16-19)\n* An interesting historical note on the harsh judgement on Agag in 1 Samuel. During the capture and even trial of Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal responsible for the mass murder of millions of Jews, when his sentence was handed down, his mother demanded mercy. And the president of Israel at the time quoted this passage back, essentially arguing that just like Agag, Eichmann is receiving the karmic justice he deserves for his war crimes.\n\nThere is much more I could say on this subject but it would not fill this OP which is already very very long.",

        "text": "Hi all! Just wanted to bring up something that doesn't get brought up a lot in these spaces but which I feel like is an important topic and cultural gap between Christianity and Islam and other various faiths. There's something that I feel causes a lot of misunderstanding and conflict that I feel can perhaps be helped by talking about it. Specifically this is the concept of Religious Consent,  and more specifically a simple four word sentence any Non-Christian or Non-Muslim has likely heard: \"I'll pray for you 🙏\"\n\nAside from the fact this often used passive-aggressively, it's also a very quick way to land yourself in hot water. I've often seen Christians and Muslims confused by this. There's a big gap in religious culture I think, so let me hopefully shed some light at least from the pagan perspective\n\nTo Pagans like myself the relationship between an individual or communities and their Gods are intensely personal, but more importantly, they're voluntary, mutual, and consensual. We are polytheists, and so if people have had a negative experience or opinion of a deity they may focus on other Gods or exclude that deity entirely, and that's not seen as an issue. Even some of the Gods do not care for the presence of certain other Gods, but I digress. \n\nIf a person does not want a particular God or Goddess involved in their lives that's seen as almost a sacred boundary, not to be crossed, as invoking that God or Goddess to their lives is seen as almost violating. As a result,w hen we pagans pray for other pagans consent is paramount. We ask, \"Would you be alright if I made offerings to (insert Gods here)  on your behalf\" or \"may I pray to (insert Gods here)  for them to help you\"?\n\nSo when a Christian or Muslim jumps over that and just goes \"I'll pray for you 🙏\", it's, in our religious culture, breaking a pretty serious taboo and seen as highly rude and inconsiderate. Christians and Muslims tend to come from different religious cultures themselves where saying that isn't really a big deal both because of their religious principles and the fact that their religions are often normalized in their cultures, so they tend to not even think about it. \n\nThey may even feel like doing so is a kindness to a person, but because of religious cultural differences instead it comes off as spitting in their face and telling them to be grateful for it. \n\nI just want to let Christians and Muslims know that so hopefully we can avoid these things in future. Before you say \"I'll pray for you 🙏\", ask the person if they're okay with that and respect their boundaries if they say no.",

It also would imply learning other Faith's and spiritual traditions and to gain insight from that, not to see the muslims as knowing everything. To understand the philosophy of buddhism, of chinese philosophy, of taoism of the maoris, the mayans, the Egyptians, Greeks etc. Lastly the verse implies that traditions and cultural differences are irrelevant but that the heart of the person matters not their race, culture or religious background. \n\n**The example of those who spend their wealth in the cause of Allah is that of a grain that sprouts into seven ears, each bearing one hundred grains. And Allah multiplies The reward even more’ to whoever He wills. For Allah is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing**\n2:261- This verse praises the act of sincere charity with the metaphor of a corn crop which multiplies by ears and grains of corn. There are multiple interpretations for this metaphor. Some say it refers to the multiplicity/infinity of the heavenly rewards and the power that charity has or that of a simple charity act being multiplied in good deeds and significance. Another view is that it describes the ripple effect and power that a small act of charity can have that multiplies and benefits much more people that can be intended. An example of donating a water well which could benefit tons of people for years yet seems such a small act. And some see this verse as karmic to say that charity multiples and will benefit the giver materially as well. There are some nde stories in which a person is shown a small charitable act (watering a plant or feeding a bird) which we would consider insignificant yet this act is praised and loved by all beings in the realms for the love that goes into it. \n\n**No soul can imagine what joys are kept in store for them as a reward for what they used to do**\n32:17 &amp; 2:25 - This verse speaks to the heavenly realms having happiness that is unable to be put in words and unable to be conceived by people in their normal waking life. It may refer to pleasures that are beyond what the physical world can offer or to the intensity of joy which cannot be imagined and quantified. It's also interesting to note that in some ndes people report hearing music that no earthly music could compare to and to seeing colors that dont exist in this world at all. What other surprises could exist in such a realm is a mystery to be very curious of. \n\n**Say, 'O Prophet,’ “If the ocean were ink for 'writing’ the Words of my Lord, it would certainly run out before the Words of my Lord were finished, even if We refilled it with its equal.”** 18:109 \nA cool metaphor for the omniscience and/or omnicreativity of the creator. \n\n**Indeed, We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they 'all' declined to  bear it, being fearful of it. But humanity assumed it, 'for' they are truly wrongful 'to themselves' and ignorant 'of the consequences** 33:72 &amp; 41:12 \nThis verse baffles exegetes and the tafsirs struggle to interpret it. It does ring similarity to a concept found in some ndes of people choosing to incarnate on earth for some spiritual growth or to gain the reward. It also gives an impression of the cosmos being sentient something also found in ndes &amp; the psalms. \n\n**We are your supporters in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. There you will have whatever your souls desire, and there you will have whatever you ask for. An accommodation from the All-Forgiving, Most Merciful 'Lord**\n41:31 in particular is interesting as it seems repetitive but it is mentioning 2 different things ie having all the desires you ask for but also all the subconscious hidden desires of the soul that remain buried deep within us we dont even know it. \n\n**Allah gives abundant or limited provisions to whoever He wills. And they rejoice in the pleasures of˺ this worldly life. But the life of this world, compared to the Hereafter, is nothing but a fleeting enjoyment**\n13:26, 29:64, 9:38 , 18:45 - It's interesting how these verses highlight this worlds happiness as constantly fading away and even the best life on earth as insignificant when compared to the afterlife. It inspires me to consider what the nature of happiness means. \n\n**I did not create jinn and humans except to worship me. I seek no provision from them, nor do I need them to feed Me** \n51:56-57 - This verse is often criticized as being egotistic but the next verse to it forces us to think deeper about what this service to God really is. If God has no need for human worship. In fact verse 56 and 57 seem to oppose each other \n\n**When Moses came at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he asked, “My Lord! Reveal Yourself to me so I may see You.” Allah answered, “You cannot see Me! But look at the mountain. If it remains firm in its place, only then will you see Me.” When his Lord appeared to the mountain, He \nlevelled it to dust and Moses collapsed unconscious. When he recovered, he cried, “Glory be to You! I turn to You in repentance and I am the first of the believers** \n7:143, 2:253 - These verses are fascinating to the sufi and mystic minded who are curious as to the actual essence of God and what it actually was like to speak to God directly or witness the beatific vision. A topic debated by great thinkers such as al ghazali, ibn sina etc \n\n**He will ask 'them', “How many years did you remain on earth?” 113. They will reply, “We remained 'only' a day or part of a day. But ask those who kept count.” 114. He will say, “You only remained for a little while, if only you knew. 115. Did you then think that We had created you without purpose, and that you would never be returned to Us?”**\n23:112-115 - The nature of this world as waking up from a dream is fascinating to behold. From our perspective this world has so much power on us and we perceive time so strongly. To perceive a whole lifetime as simply a day blip is incredible\n\n**And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and all living beings He dispersed throughout both. And He is Most Capable of bringing all together whenever He wills**\n42:29 - Some call this the alien verse as many believe it implies the existence of organic alien life or civilisations out in the cosmos. \n\n**Remember' when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a successive 'human' authority on earth.” They asked 'Allah', “Will You place in it  someone who will spread corruption there and shed blood while we glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I know what you do not know.” He taught Adam the names of all things, then He presented them to the angels and said, “Tell Me the names of these, if what you say is true?**\n2:30 - This verse is famous for implying adam as being some successor to previous beings on the earth and is famous for demonstrating the Angel's shock at the evil in the world something we humans can relate to greatly. It also speaks to the origin of language\n\n**They ask you 'O Prophet’ about the spirit. Say, “Its nature is known only to my Lord, and you 'O humanity’ have been given but little knowledge.”**\n17:85- One of the most interesting fields of study is philosophy of mind and neuroscience and even with all that we discover consciousness remains ever a mystery. \n\n53:4-18 - An intriguing passage on the cosmic journey of miraaj\n\n**Know that this worldly life is no more than play, amusement, luxury, mutual boasting, and competition in wealth and children. This is like rain that causes plants to grow, to the delight of the planters. But later the plants dry up and you see them wither, then they are reduced to chaff. And in the Hereafter there will be either severe punishment or forgiveness and pleasure of Allah, whereas the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment**\n57:20 - I like this one as it sums up the nature of the world as capitalistic societies that endlessly run until you reach the end and all of it ends up the same. It sums up how we all live to pretend and compete with each other in money, status, importance. But eventually none of this pretension satisfies us. It gives of a Buddhist vibe of the worlds desires as illusory. \n\n**Whoever does good, it is to their own benefit. And whoever does evil, it is to their own loss. Then to your Lord you will 'all' be returned.**\n45:15- These are very karmic thinking with all good leading to good karma and bad leading to bad karma. In some nde stories people have life reviews in which they can feel the good done to others and the bad done to others as if it's their own. \n\n**We did not create the heavens and the earth and everything in between for sport. 17. Had We intended to take 'some' amusement, We could have found it in Our presence, if that had been Our Will**\n21:16-17 - This is a famous question that many skeptics would ask. What purpose is there to a self sufficient god creating all of us. Are we like one big Sims game to god that he has created to experiment and entertain himself with. Especially given the level of suffering in the world its a question many will come across. \n\n**So when I have fashioned him and had a spirit of My Own 'creation I breathed into him, fall down in prostration to him.”**\n15:29 - This verse reminds me of the eastern concept of cosmic consciousness and humans as being a drop returning to the ocean. In some sense a divine aspect has been given from god to humanity. Some translators try to avoid translating it as breathed into adam of MY spirit to avoid shirk issues \n\n**Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. His lights is like a niche in which there is a lamp, the lamp is in a crystal, the crystal is like a shining star, lit from 'the oil of’ a blessed olive tree, 'located' neither to the east nor the westj7^] whose oil would almost glow, even without being touched by fire. Light upon light! Allah guides whoever He wills to His light. And Allah sets forth parables for humanity. For Allah has 'perfect’ knowledge of all things.**\n24:35 - Another very mystical verse with multiple interpretations each one as interesting as the next. \n\n**As for the disbelievers, their deeds are like a mirage in a desert, which the thirsty perceive as water, but when they approach it, they find it to be nothing. Instead, they find Allah there 'in the Hereafter, ready' to settle their account. And Allah is swift in reckoning**\n24:39 - This metaphor implies some sort of illusion or hypocrisy with the mirage parable. Highlights that not everything is as it seems in the world. We cannot see peoples inner hearts and we should not judge people by appearance or be naive. Some people may appear to the world as a very great but its an illusion\n\n**As for those who believe and do good, We will certainly absolve them of their sins, and reward them according to the best of what they used to do**\n29:7 - From this we see that the value of a person will be by the best of their morality and not by the worst of their bad deeds. Its common for society to look down upon and show prejudice to those considered immoral even when they have reformed such as gangsters, criminals, murderers or pornstars. But from this verse God will honor all people by their best deeds and not humiliate them by what they not proud of.",

        "text": " Much of God is so “human.” I don't quite understand the image of Allah. It doesn't make much sense somehow – but maybe my thinking is just wrong.\n\nSo, the reason I'm asking these questions is that I haven't gotten any meaningful answers to them yet. Perhaps they can be answered by those who know more than I do… \n\n   \n\n\n**Question 1:** Why has God made it so easy to be misguided?\n\n   \n**Question 2:** Why does a God have to threaten with hell?\n\n   \n**Question 3:** Why does God have a “throne”? Where is this place, “above the heavens”?\n\n   \n**Question 4:** Why are there 4 holy books—all claiming to tell the truth—and that everyone else is going to hell? Why is this “test” of what life is supposed to be, made so difficult for most of the humankind?\n\n   \n**Question 5:** Why weren't we just created so that most people could pass the “test” easier? Instead, there are so many souls running wild without the “true faith” and will fill the eternal hell.\n\n   \n**Question 6:** Can you believe that the entire human race was actually created from just 2 people (Adam and Eve) through constant inbreeding? Or is this symbolism? If yes, symbolism about what exactly?\n\n   \n**Question 7:** The whole belief system is a trade: do good, go to paradise for eternity, where you can fuck like you want and drink alcohol from rivers—or sip delicious honey from rivers. Or be a rebel, but exchange 80 years of life for an infinite time of hell.\n\nCan you explain this concept in a meaningful way, what about this is something someone should thrive for?\n\n   \n**Question 8:** *(51:49) And of all things We created two mates; perhaps you will remember.*\n\nThis verse states that of all living beings, 2 pairs were created, male and female. For example, was God not aware that Aspidoscelis uniparens (desert grassland whiptail lizard) reproduces through lesbian relationships—and there are only females of this animal? Or that earthworms are hermaphrodites? What about those examples? Didn’t I get the true meaning of the verse because of lack of understanding?\n\n   \n**Question 9:** *(33:51) You (O Muhammad SAW) can postpone (the turn of) whom you will of them (your wives), and you may receive whom you will. And whomsoever you desire of those whom you have set aside (her turn temporarily), it is no sin on you (to receive her again), that is better; that they may be comforted and not grieved, and may all be pleased with what you give them. Allah knows what is in your hearts. And Allah is Ever All-Knowing, Most Forbearing.*\n\nImagine a book that claims to be “a guide for mankind until the Day of Judgment”—and it includes such a verse that provides guidance on the order in which the prophet can perform his sexual practices. What wisdom am I supposed to gain from this? Why does it even say such a thing?  Why do I need this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 10:** *(27:55) Would ye really approach men in your lusts rather than women? Nay, ye are a people (grossly) ignorant!*\n\nThe destruction of Sodom was because of the homosexual activities of its inhabitants. Why does God hate homosexual practices so much that an entire nation was destroyed because of it? Why did God intervene in such cases?\n\n*(26:173) We rained down on them a shower (of brimstone): and evil was the shower on those who were admonished (but heeded not)!* \n\nWhy doesn't God interfere more in today's events?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 11:** There is a God who burns people eternally, constantly renews their skin so that it can be burned again, makes them drink bloody pus, sows discord between people, and incites them to blood feuds just because they don't believe He exists....\n\nMy question is: Why does an all-powerful, all-knowing and loving God do such a thing? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 12:** *(3:61) Now, whoever disputes with you ˹ O Prophet concerning Jesus after full knowledge has come to you, say, “Come! Let us gather our children and your children, our women, and your women, ourselves and yourselves—then let us sincerely invoke Allah’s curse upon the liars.”*\n\nAllah curses? Why is something like this even required or needed? Couldn't this be solved in any other way than threatening God's curse?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 13:** God loves us so much that He created hell just in case we don’t love Him back…. Oh, and it seems to happen on a whim who he wants to send to hell: \n\n*(16:93) And had Allah willed, He would have made you one community, but He leads astray whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills, and you will most surely be asked about what you used to do.*\n\nHow does this fit with the image of an infinitely loving God?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 14:** Did you know that people in Iceland fast for 18 to 22 hours on Ramadan? How is that fair to those who are more fortunate with the daily schedule? What about countries where, in some cases, the sun does not rise for many days?\n\n   \n**Question 15:** Why didn't He send a book that everyone can understand in their language? Why did He leave it to the translators? How can I be expected to believe that this book was written by God if there are always mistakes in my understanding?\n\n   \n**Question 16:** *(25:44) Or do you think that most of them listen or understand? They are only like cattle—no, more than that, they have strayed from the right path!*\n\nWhy is using God “cattles” as an insult here? Why does God insult His creation by using His other creation for this purpose?\n\n   \n**Question 17:** *(49:2) O believers! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor speak loudly to him as you do to one another,1 or your deeds will become void while you are unaware.*\n\nYou go and create a universe of quadrillions of stars and then send a book that says, “Do not shout at Muhammad as you shout at each other, or your good deeds will be erased.” What practical conclusion can I draw from this verse for my use today? There hasn't been a prophet to shout at for over 1,400 years, anyway….\n\n   \n**Question 18:** *“How thoughtful of God to arrange matters so that, wherever you happen to be born, the local religion always turns out to be the true one.” — Richard Dawkins*\n\nDid you ever think about that? How can you be “fortunate” if your belief is a regional matter?\n\n   \n**Question 19:** All plants, animals, and other natural creatures mentioned in the Qur'an are native to the Middle East: Living and non-living things from other regions are not mentioned.\n\nFor example, the desert is mentioned, but not lakes or forests. Natural phenomena that do not occur in the region such as snow, ice, hail, and fog are not mentioned in the Qur'an. Crops such as oranges, tangerines, watermelons, walnuts, hazelnuts, potatoes are not mentioned, nor are animals from the region such as kangaroos, llamas, pelicans, seals…\n\nWhy is the Qur'an so adapted to one geographical location and ignores most of the earth?\n\n   \n**Question 20:** The almighty God sent 124,000 prophets (messengers) to prove His existence, and still the greatest part of mankind is not Muslim. Not very efficient… What do you think about it? Are humans simply not adapted to the belief system, if not, why were we not created that way?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 20.1:** Was only one of those 124,000 prophets a woman?\n\n   \n**Question 21:** *(4:56) Surely those who reject Our signs, We will cast them into the Fire. Whenever their skin is burnt completely, We will replace it, so they will ˹ constantly taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.*\n\nWhy does God have to threaten and make you afraid in case you disobey Him? I mean… Fear works… But isn't fear a lower emotion that shouldn't be used as a tool like that?\n\n*(32:13) Had We willed, We could have easily imposed guidance on every soul. But My Word will come to pass: I will surely fill up Hell with jinn and humans all together.*\n\nIs it God who says, “I would take you all to my heaven, but I have promised to fill hell with you, and I cannot go back on my word”?\n\nWhy does God promise such a thing? Why does He need to promise such a thing to anyone? To whom did he promise it?\n\n   \n**Question 22:** If the earth is the place of testing, why did he create 100 billion galaxies?\n\n   \n**Question 23:** *(33:53) O believers! Do not enter the homes of the Prophet without permission ˹ and if invited for a meal, do not ˹ come too early and linger until the meal is ready. But if you are invited, then enter ˹ on time. Once you have eaten, then go on your way, and do not stay for casual talk. Such behavior is truly annoying to the Prophet, yet he is too shy to ask you to leave. But Allah is never shy of the truth. And when you ˹ believers ask his wives for something, ask them from behind a barrier. This is purer for your hearts and theirs. And it is not right for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor ever marry his wives after him. This would certainly be a major offense in the sight of Allah.*\n\nAgain: Allah admonishes people not to annoy his prophet? Why is this written in the holy book of God?\n\nReading the Qur'an is considered a Deed. But why should I recite something like that? There are many more verses like that, which doesn’t really help anyone today… Am I missing something?\n\n   \n**Question 24:** Why do you think God did not create another human couple instead of letting breeding the children of Adam and Eve? Did the mud run out?\n\n   \n**Question 25:** *(2:106) If We ever abrogate a verse or cause it to be forgotten, We replace it with a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah is Most Capable of everything?*\n\nThe interesting thing is, what are the verses that have been “abrogated”, nobody knows, it is not written anywhere… Those verses have been there for 1400 years in the Qur'an.\n\nIs there any information regarding this?\n\n   \n**Question 26:** If you were born into a non-Muslim family, would you have become a Muslim when you grew up? Have you ever sat down and seriously thought about it?\n\nIf your immediate answer to this question is “yes I would”, why is it that not everyone in the world is a Muslim, are you so different from everyone else? Have you seriously thought about that too?\n\n   \n**Question 27:** *(78:31-36) Indeed, the righteous will have salvation— Gardens, vineyards, and full-bosomed maidens of equal age, and full cups ˹ of pure wine, never to hear any idle talk or lying therein— a ˹ fitting reward as a generous gift from your Lord,*\n\nAnd God, the creator of the vast universe, says something like: “O men! If you have faith, if you submit to me and Muhammad, if you obey my commands, I will find you beautiful women”?\n\nIs this something that is compatible with concepts such as the infinite power and glory of God?\n\n   \n**Question 28:** *(2:99) Indeed, We have sent down to you ˹O Prophet˺* ***clear revelations****. ˹But˺ none will deny them except the rebellious.*\n\n*(3:7) He is the One Who has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book, of which* ***some verses are precise—they are the foundation of the Book—while others are elusive****. Those with deviant hearts follow the elusive verses, seeking ˹to spread˺ doubt through their ˹false˺ interpretations—but none grasps their ˹full˺ meaning except Allah. As for those well-grounded in knowledge, they say, “We believe in this ˹Quran˺—it is all from our Lord.” But none will be mindful ˹of this˺ except people of reason.*\n\nAre the revelations clear – or not so clear? Is this a contradiction, or am I lacking understanding?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 29:** You believe that a man who lived 950 years built a big ship and took a pair of all the animals on it, and those animals did not eat each other, and when the flood was over, each animal returned safely to its home and billions of creatures came back…\n\nYou believe in a man splitting the sea in two with his stick.\n\nYou believe in Satan challenging the great God and making a bet…\n\nYou believe that Adam and Eve were expelled from paradise because of an apple and that their children had incestuous relationships…\n\nYou believe that Cain and Abel practiced agriculture and could read and write.\n\nBut you don't believe in evolution?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 30:** Why are scientists mostly atheists? Why are those who advance our humankind punished with hell?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 31:** Why is there not a single country developed with religion?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 32:**Why is it that there are dozens of verses in the Quran that regulate the sex life of the Prophet Muhammad, but not a single verse about dinosaurs that ruled the Earth for 120 million years?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 33:**Why does God burn those in hell who do wrong or do not believe in Him, while mothers always stroke the hair of their children who do wrong? Why is God not loving like mothers do, instead He threatens with eternal hell?\n\nWhy is the whole system based so much on fearmongering?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 34:**Were the Middle Easterners sent to earth as a demo version of Hell?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 35:**Why is there not a single country in the world that is peacefully governed by true sharia? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 36:***(Bukhari / Tajrid 192) Aisha says: O Muhammad, whenever you see a beautiful woman, a verse from heaven will immediately descend so that you can have her.*\n\nDid you know that there are hadith like this and others like it? What is your opinion?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 37:**There are hundreds, thousands of religions. Each one calls the other a liar. Each one predicts that if we don't believe in it, we will be damned, we will burn. How do we know which one to believe? Is there anything that can prove that one of them is absolutely true?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 38:**Why is it that we can ride in a car built by infidels, use their electricity, use their Internet, use their computers, use their cell phones, fly in their airplanes, watch TV from their satellites, call the call to prayer from their megaphones, but not eat the meat they slaughter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 39:**There is bloodshed in the region where the Quran rules. Why didn't God create human beings with the intelligence to understand His book? How can you be certain that you fully understand the Quran and live as he wants you to (maybe because you live in a western free and secular country that is not governed by sharia?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 40:**Agatha Christie lived 86 years and wrote 80 novels. Her novels were translated into all the languages of the world, and every reader understood them.\n\nEI-ilah (God) is all-powerful, but no one understands his book: if it were not for exegetes and interpreters, there would be no one to understand the “truth” in it as it is, or most of the world would not understand it at all. If it were not for the 20th century atheist scientists, many of the “miracles” in it would not be understood. Don't you think there is something strange about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 41:**Isn't Allah the greatest atheist? He ignores other gods and says that only He exists. If we think so, isn't it an ego game that he wants to burn atheists in hell?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 42:**Khnemu, the god of Egypt: With the skill of a potter, he molded clay and created man;\n\nGod Prometheus: With his tears he molded the earth into clay and created man;\n\nGod Zeus: He gave orders; God Hephaestus took the earth, mixed it with water, put sound in it and created man;\n\nSumerian God Marduk: He mixed the earth with blood, made mud and created the first human being;\n\nGod Aruru: He put his hands on a reed, broke off a piece of mud and threw it into writing, and in this writing he created the hero Enkidu;\n\nThe Chinese God Pen-Gu: created human beings from insects, but after a while humanity disappeared, so the Goddess Ngüho created a new human species from clay;\n\nThere is a difference of about 4,500 years between the Sumerian God Marduk and Allah.\n\nDo you not think the miracle of the creation of man is a borrowing from ancient polytheistic mythologies? What is the Muslim view on this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 43:**There are many more murders committed for God than for Satan. How do you explain this? Was it a false witness? Or is it the devil's mischief that causes God to be blamed? If so, why is there war and killing in the scriptures? Whose fault is that? Man's fault, God's fault or Satan's fault? Who can we blame?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 44:***God is nothing but an exaggerated father figure (Sigmund Freud)*\n\nwhat do you think about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 45:**One of the pillars of Islam is to go on pilgrimage. What is the money given to Arabia for Hajj used for? Does anyone know? Is it definitely used for good? If not, isn't it problematic to go for Hajj? Is there any information about that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 46:***”Allah has made it lawful for you to break your oaths when necessary.*\n\n*(Surah Tahrim verse 2)*\n\nWhy? Is this righteousness *to break your oaths when you feel so*?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 47:**Why do Muslims say that if it is a hadith they don't like, it is a lie, or a fabrication, or deny all hadith…\n\nBut if it is a verse they don't like, they can't say it is a fabrication, so they say “it is not meant to say that”, “it is a wrong translation”, etc., and proceed to twist the verse?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 48:***(3:178) Those who disbelieve should not think that living longer is good for them. They are only given more time to increase in sin, and they will suffer a humiliating punishment.*\n\nIs that god's fairness and loving kindness? How can I understand that? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 49:***(18:54) We have surely set forth in this Quran every ˹kind of˺ lesson for people, but humankind is the most argumentative of all beings.*\n\nIs it a mistake to question for better understanding? Am I making a big mistake right now, making people think about difficult to understand topics regarding the true and only religion of almighty God?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 50:***(43:55) So when they enraged Us, We inflicted punishment upon them, drowning them all.*\n\nAn enraged God? Why can't he control his temper? How can we understand that verse?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 51:** *(Let us inquire) what glory there was in an omnipotent being torturing forever a puny little creature who could in no way defend himself? Would it be to the glory of a man to fry ants? — Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 1923*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 52:***(9:23) O believers! Do not take your parents and siblings as trusted allies if they choose disbelief over belief. And whoever of you does so, they are the ˹true˺ wrongdoers.*\n\nYes, my Muslim sister or brother, would you turn against your family just because they don't believe? Did you ever think about that?",
