        "text": "Last update which has a link to my first post about this topic: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/ztrvhi/update_needs_discrepancies_in_relationships/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\nHello friends, \n\nAs I mentioned before I’m writing these posts half because you are all so wonderful and have incredible advice, and half to create a paper trail for myself so I can better hold myself accountable, hold onto my truth, and avoid gaslighting myself. \n\nOur “come to Jesus” talk happened about 12 days ago now and I have in that time seen significant improvement from him. He definitley pulled his head out of the sand and in big and small ways since that talk he’s been far more communicative and present. He’s been making an effort to sit and talk with me about more than just work or surface-level topics, and has balanced his time much better between video games and time with me, both relaxing and really connecting over conversation. \n\nMost notably, I was seriously ill last week with both a bad cold and a flare of my debilitating chronic illness. He REALLY shined here when I needed him. He knew I wasn’t feeling well and when he got home, he took one look at me and knew I was not okay, and came and sat with me to let me vent and cry. He let me sob and express all my deepest fears around being chronically ill and just my frustrations with feeling so unwell. He showed up with true empathy, by validating my feelings but also hearing and course-correcting my insecurities in a truly sweet and genuinely helpful way (like a fear that he will leave me someday for being sick, or that I can’t handle my job, etc). He made me feel seen and cared for and even cried WITH me at one point. I was really happy with that and it made us feel really close. I felt he was there with me authentically and with deep empathy.\n\nAn example of where he’s vastly improved his communication is he has kept me in the loop of how he’s feeling and lets me know when he’s stressed or tired or grumpy and needs space or to zone out with video games, instead of just disappearing on me. His overall daily communication has very much improved. \n\nPart of our plan going forward to increase intimacy was weekly scheduled talks and planned weekly sex. The first “relationship talk” was honestly awkward and kind of a disaster; he went back from “we are checking in and working on our relationship TOGETHER, for each other” to “I’m in trouble, and this is space for her to tell me all the ways I’m failing.” But, I also felt very unwell and was not myself, PLUS then he showed up for me so well per the above. We haven’t had our scheduled sexy date but again I was not myself (I honestly wasn’t even feeling it). I mentioned we should just skip this week and he said maybe we can move it to tomorrow! He never followed up on that which is disappointing. \n\nOne thing I’m not thrilled with is that despite me expressing that a huge problem is me always having to be the one to bring up talks and initiate sex, he was not the one to do so during just the first damn week. I really need to see effort from him in this regard to actually work the plan, or I will continue to feel like I’m dragging him along instead of that we are both invested in and working together to understand and meet each other’s needs. Im planning to bring that up one more time and then will see if I see that change over time. Again, it’s I’ve really not been well the whole first week so I’m giving a bit of a mulligan but it’s something very important that I will be keeping my eyes peeled for. \n\nFinally, we are taking an international trip this week and planning it has been really fun. He’s felt more like the version of him that I love: adventurous, excited, engaged, thrilled to live life by my side. We’ll see how the trip goes.\n\nAs a bottom line at this point I’m honestly still holding strong to my truth and working through what exactly I expect to see and by when in terms of consistent effort and sustained change. We’ve had these talks before and I’ve seen improvement in the short term only for him to backslide eventually into habits that make me feel invisible, plus I have yet to see him make the organic effort with the specific things I’m asking for that he agreed to (in fact the “weekly plan” for talks / sex was his idea), so while I saw a lot that was in a positive direction so far, it’s way to soon for me to feel optimistic. \n\nOnce we’re back I plan to put effort into documenting for myself exactly what I need to see and within what timeframe, before I will feel comfortable marrying him. \n\nWish me luck, truth, integrity, courage and strength.",

        "text": "A year ago, I moved to a new state and took a job with a company that very closely matches my values that I thought would be a good fit. It has not been that. I do not fit in with the culture, the job itself is not what I wanted or thought it would be. It's been a very hard adjustment both to the city and the company. \n\nI have been very casually looking for a new opportunity and happened upon a position with a good company in an area that I've always wanted to live. I had initial an initial conversation with them mid-December and the interview is next week. The position isn't what I want to do long term but the benefits and area are great. \n\nLast week, a company I previously worked for reached out and offered me an opportunity to come back. It would also require moving, but not to an area I've ever considered living in before. I would love to go back to this job. I really enjoy it and they people are great. Small company, opportunity to move up, an industry I have a passion for. However, it would mean moving to a salary + commission structure, which I've never done before. As well as moving, yet again. \n\nI'm still trying to figure out how I really feel about either of the two opportunities. Pros, cons, etc. \n\nI also feel like there is a chance that my current position could improve based on changes that are happening right now. And I have potential to be promoted soon (have already had initial conversations). \n\nOld company wants a decision asap, plus I have the other interview next week. My yearly review with current company is not until March so I would like to have an idea about what my chances are with them so I can decide if I want to stay. \n\nMy question is, after this long intro, is - are there any suggestions as to how to have the conversation with my current employer about future options? I've never tried to negotiate anything like this before. I'm concerned if I say that I have another opportunity and they aren't willing to offer something else, I'll be let go or forced out. \n\nI'm not 100% I want to leave and take a different job. There is a large part of me that wants to stay put, try to settle in here, make the most of it. There are things I like about the city and the company, the people I work with. So I don't wan tot burn any bridges. \n\nI really don't know what the best course of action is - has anyone been in a similar situation and have any advise? Thanks in advance.",

I basically have the mind of an early 20s right now: building my credit with my first credit card, thinking of my first job and moving out (my family was highly controlling and insidious in keeping me under their thumb).\n\nFortunately I am finally awake now. But I can’t help but notice, now all the men are saying they don’t like women over 30. Well great, I finally am available to date and I feel like it’s too late.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI (26F) am at complete loss what to do with a relationship with my dad whom I met for the first time when I was 19. It is very complex, and needs lots of context.\n\nMy parents were married, and split just before I was born, and divorced a few months after. My dad refused to be involved, and ignored my repetitive attempts to reach out to him when I was young. I sent him letters, he ignored me. I called him, he ignored me. I tried to visit him once at his company and he sent security to escort me out - I was thirteen years old then. \n\nI never understood it, and internalised everything - I had thoughts like 'something is wrong with me, that's why he doesn't care', 'I'm worthless', 'I'm just a horrible person' etc. You can imagine. As a result (together with other circumstances), I have no confidence, I lack self-worth, I struggle with relationship with men.\n\nWhen growing up, I developed coping mechanisms and made peace with the fact that I don't even know how he looks like, let alone who he is. When I turned eighteen, I felt relieved because I became an adult and did not need him anymore. \n\nAnd then he turned up. The first meeting was awkward, lasted only 5 minutes and it felt as if someone picked a random guy on a street, put him in front of me and said: 'This is your dad, be friends now.' \n\nAfter, we exchanged a couple of emails once a six months, and then met for a coffee, three years later. We had a long talk about everything superficially, but I already knew that I wanted to ask him what were his reasons he abandoned me. I was scared though, and at the same time, mind-blowed to see why I am so different to everyone in my family because I am (unfortunately) so much like him. We have the same interests, do similar careers, look very alike. It was the first time when it started messing with my mental health.   \n   \nThe relationship kept going - I however live abroad, so we would see each other only every six months or once a year. Some years later, he invited me to his summer home - I knew he was rich, but turns out he is very rich. I, a girl who lived on the edge of poverty with a single mum her whole life, suddenly walked through corridors of two centuries old building that he was renovating. I saw the life I could've had. I also met my five years younger sister. I cried the whole drive back home, devastated. I started questioning who I am, what is my life, am I like him or my mum, how to I navigate the relationship with him, where do I fit in this madness - I was already 24 years old that time.\n\nThen, he started calling me every month. We would spend hours on phone as I would just go along with his chattiness. However, whatever involves him, it causes me enormous amount of anxiety and stress. \n\nFast forward to 2022, I finally confronted him about the abandonment, after trying to do it for three years. His response - he criticised my mum and insulted her. He said that he didn't want to argue with her over me. I communicated with him my perspective and told him what impact his absence had on me, and what were my thoughts on it as a child, and the consequence in my adult life, and his response to that was that he was sorry but he would do it all over again, exactly the same way.\n\nAt first I was proud of myself that I managed to open the conversation, but now I am just devastated because his words felt like 'you still have no value to me. I would hurt you all again.' \n\nMum criticises me for 'overthinking it too much' and 'being too sensitive' and revealed more things that happened between them when I was little. I started questioning again, why am I alive if both of my parents despise me, and I feel like everything would've been easier if I wasn't born, as my existence caused them so much pain and that never was my intention.\n\nToday I had four missed calls from him, and the anxiety kicked in again. I am leaving soon, and he expects me to meet him tomorrow or Thursday. \n\nTo make it more complicated, there are fears that he could disinherit me if I tell him to fuck off and end the relationship now, but I would be willing to sacrifice that if it gives me peace of mind. The rest of my family heavily disagree and want me to maintain the relationship. I have no idea what to do.",

        "text": "After years of making excuses from pursuing a hobby that I’ve always really enjoyed, I finally committed to shooting film and digital photography. I made a second social media account and started sharing my journey in hopes that I would find a community of not only people to learn from, but who also would be starting out their own stuff. \n\nFor the most part there isn’t a ton of one-one-one conversations or personal interactions. I do not link my personal account to it and I go by a nickname as well to try and keep it a little more separate from my “real life.”\n\nThere was a ‘community’ account that messaged me earlier into my creation of it, and I initially thought they were being friendly, so I was open to the engagement. But, shortly into the conversation they made a comment that gave me the ick. This account is clearly ran by someone who has extensive experience and knowledge in both film and digital photography, but they made a comment to me, a very small and obviously new person, that I “could teach them” how to load film into a certain type of camera. To be clear, 35mm film loading is relatively the same for most camera bodies. I did not reply.\n\nThey had tried to engage with me again on a couple of stories I posted, but I just “❤️”’d the message without saying anything because I didn’t want to be rude, and then moved on. About 2.5 weeks after that first conversation they had messaged me about a post I made for my husband and I’s 2nd dog (his 1st bday). The conversation was very normal and only about him having that dog previously/my current pup. \n\nFollowing that, conversation would pop up from time to time, always about thing’s related just to film. If it ever started to shift to different topics, I always kept any of my personal life very vague **EXCEPT** for the fact that I am very happily married. I made it a point to mention my husband every single time there was any type of discussion that didn’t focus on photography. It didn’t get weird again so I thought (stupidly) that I could make a new friend and that I must have misjudged him originally. \n\nWe really did not share more than 2-3 things about ourselves outside of the hobby itself before he says:\n\n“I’m telling you a lot of personal things and I don’t even know who you are or what you look like 😂” \n\nMind you, I have my profile picture of myself, have a highlight that has pictures of both myself and my husband+me. One highlight of which he specifically has replied to. So, this is just a blatant lie. He then shares his personal page and formally introduces himself. Alarm bells start screaming for me so I respond (location redacted for privacy):\n\n“Aww that’s a bummer! Sorry to hear that but happy for y’all to have the one. Thank you! I have been told that a lot 😊 also I’m pretty sure you commented on the photo of my husband and I at [XXX] lol so you do know what I look like.\n\nJust wanna say that I hope I’m not giving the wrong impression or anything, I genuinely appreciate your page but feel like the vibe I’m getting isn’t really at a professional/acquaintance in the community level. Don’t wanna give off the wrong idea.”\n\nHe then claims that he was about to say the same thing. But apologizes and says he’ll scale his interactions back, etc. so now I felt horrible and awkward like I was being presumptuous and unfair to someone given experiences in the past. \n\nBut, I was wrong again. Interactions from there were certainly less frequent but even if I tried to stop responding and send a polite reaction to a message instead of a response, he would message again. It always remained “normal” so I tried to just give him the benefit of the doubt. Until this last time. \n\nI have the intention to get into portrait photography, so I have a project planned for the start of this year to do some self-portraits to help learn my new equipment and editing software. I posted a photo of a self-portrait I did in 2020 that I have always loved. The way the photo is, there’s a shadow on my face but most of my figure is in it. It’s not an inappropriate picture either, just one where the sun is behind me so you mostly just see a silhouette. I also had changed my profile photo around the same time. \n\nHe specifically responded to my upload twice. The first time he says:\n\n“Promise I’m not saying it hit on you but that last one looks great! I like the shadows.” \n\nWhich was fine I guess, it made me feel a little weird but I shrugged it off. Not even 30 minutes after that, in response to me saying that I hope my project elicits at least 1 good shot of 1000, he says:\n\n“From all your profile changes today you are very photogenic😜” \n\nI stop responding. I just felt so stupid. I felt like I let so much slide and like I knew better but wanted to believe in the best of someone. I don’t know if maybe I’m still just being overly sensitive. I asked one of my good guy-friends and sent screenshots, and even he said that I’m not imagining it and my gut is right. I still feel just gross and like it’s my fault. Even after all the times I talked about my husband and put my foot down. It makes me feel like I can’t be myself and talk to anyone (mostly men honestly) without giving some wrong idea. It makes me feel so sick to my stomach. I would never do anything to betray or disrespect my marriage or my husband. \n\nDo you ever stop feeling this way? I’m 27 and I feel just as small by this whole thing as I did in my teens when shit like this would happen. The only difference being I blame myself like 10% less than back then.",

        "text": "I'm 34 weeks with a high risk pregnancy and need your ladies' advice please. \n\nMy whole relationship (6y), I've had to ask/remind my husband multiple times to do things. This is especially stressful when we have to be on time somewhere - I always seem to have to nag him for us to get out the door (and even then, we're still always late because he takes his sweet time despite my urgency). If anything, I'd say I'm on the low-end of the \"nagging\" scale.\n\nToday, we were supposed to leave to visit my sister. She was making a nice lunch for us. The usual routine starts, I give him 1 hour heads up that we have to leave by 1pm. I remind him again at 12:30, then again at 12:45 when he still isn't dressed and hasn't moved from his computer yet. 1pm rolls around and he starts eating something, and I say (calmly, if I may add) that it's time to go.\n\nLong story short, he freaks out and starts yelling at me to stop nagging at him, and it's only a few minutes late and my sister can wait. He slams some cupboards and throws things around, smashes the coffee pot (accidentally, but still terrifying), yells at me, etc. I did worry for a moment he'd hit me, even though he never has before.\n\nI start crying (because I'm hormonal and hate being yelled at), and I have to end up cancelling the whole thing because I just can't deal with this right now &amp; am having contractions and a panic attack.\n\nI'm wondering - am I doing something wrong ?! Is this the rest of my life? Is it a red flag (he's never gotten so mad before)....\n\nFor context, I've told him before, multiple times, that being late causes me high anxiety, and it's so disrespectful to the person waiting for you. I'm wondering if maybe it is me afterall and I just need to \"relax\" and be late ?",

        "text": "Hi ladies. I've been debating writing about this in here for a long time now. But I feel like I could really benefit from your advice and insight about my situation. (English is not my first language, sorry if  there are mistakes).  \n\n\nMarch 2022 I \\[F33\\] was happily single, and one of my direct coworkers \\[M33\\], that I had known for 1,5  years at this point, started talking to me on a deeper level on Teams. This was someone I had never questioned whether I liked or not, I had never looked at him this way. Anyways, the conversations were endless,  we were really clicking. We had our first date 2 weeks later, it was amazing, we kissed. Never in a million years would I had dated a coworker, this was actually one of my \"rules\", but he showed so much interest and care and gentleness that I just went with it feeling quite sure actually. We dated for 4 months and the time spent together was amazing. The chemistry was insane (still is). I could sense that he was \"fearful\" to where we were headed in a way; he never expressed feelings for me, didn't introduce me to his friends. He explained he liked to really take the time to know the other person, which I understood and respected.  His actions though showed everything I needed to know. I was sure he was developing feelings for me - and so did every friend and family member I talked about my relationship to. He was nice, caring, attentive, thoughtful. This was a brilliantly healthy relationship.\n\nJuly 2022 I told him I had feelings for him, he told me he had not developed some towards me. That he felt \"emotionally disabled\", that with his last girlfriend it had lasted 6 months and ended the same way; he had not developed feelings. He didn't know what was going on about him and his heart, he told me nothing was wrong or negative about me, he really liked our moments together - nothing was wrong, I was a great woman, but he was not in love. And he was really sad about it actually. As I was.\n\nWe took the time to think about it and ended our relationship. Of course as we work directly together, getting over the breakup was really hard for me but I felt like I managed to do it (or so I thought) and end of August, I was feeling fine.\n\nFirst week of September 2022 we saw each other again privately as friends, and ended up spending the night and sleeping together. Then decided to go FWB (such a bad idea). Our FWB included watching movies, ordering sushi, talking for hours and always spending the night together, cuddling while sleeping. It lasted 2 months, during when he checked regularly if we were still on the same page as he was afraid it would hurt me. And for a moment there I was totally fine with this FWB thing, didn't wait nor want anything more from him, or so I thought. But finally I plucked up the courage to end it on November 30  'cause I was sensing my feelings resurfacing. When I ended this, he responded among other things that he had met other people during this FWB time, and that he felt our FWB relationship took \"space\" in his mind, that he was comparing all of the other women to me and seeing me when he talked with them, and thinking \"if I do this with this person, I won't have that anymore with \\*\\[me\\]\\*). That he had thought about starting the relationship again with me, that maybe we hadn't written the full story when we broke up. That he was sure it'd be perfect as before if we tried again, but that he'd probably screw it up in a way, by not catching feelings.\n\nThis just lost me. And gave me hope I guess.\n\nEveryone I know who I told this story to said \"he's in love with you, he just won't see it\". But I also know that no matter the actions, if someone says to you they don't have feelings for you, you have to believe them.\n\nAnd now I still love him. But I have to move on and it's bloody difficult since we work directly together. I get some breathing room during the week-ends, feel better, and when I come back to the office and see him again, hear his voice again, I'm back to square one. I've been in this cycle for weeks now.\n\nNow, I've always been the person who goes absolutely no contact with an ex, and I've actually never remained friends with one of them. And doing so, I have found that it takes me approximately 3 months to get over someone. But with him, no contact is impossible, and that's why I'm drowning and miserable.\n\nAlso here's the thing:\n\n1/ I absolutely love my job, and worked really hard for two years to get a permanent contract in this company, which I got in May 2022. There is absolutely no way I'm running away from this job.\n\n2/ Our team of coworkers and him and I are really close. We get along really well and often go to afterwork parties and other things outside of work together. I have only a few friends where I live, I absolutely love my coworkers team like a second family, and I actually am quite a central piece in this circle (and so is he..). I'm not running away from that either.\n\n3/ This is someone who has never lied, never done anything wrong to me, always treated me right, always communicated clearly and in a healthy way with me - he is a truly nice gentle person that I still click amazingly with. He still cares for me a lot and is showing it. This is therefore someone I'd consider staying friends with (even though I'm incapable of doing that right now; it would break me if he announced me he has found someone else). His only \"fault\" was that he didn't fall in love with me. I cannot and won't be mad at him for that. I have to accept it and move on, he just was not my person - but it's damn hard since I see him everyday, and don't have one detail to be resentful at him for? He taught me so much about relationships, and he really set my standards up high for future relationships (and it was needed!). I have nothing but good things to say about this man and gratefulness for what he taught me and how he treated me. He just \"wasn't my person\". But he remains my ideal one now...\n\nI don't know, I think I need some mental mantras to remember each day as I walk in the office or something... I really don't know what to do to get over him for good.\n\nI would love your input and advice about my situation.\n\nThanks a lot for reading &lt;3",

For example… We have one family vehicle, a large van, and he has a commuter. Every time he uses the van to haul things (which is often) he doesn’t put the seats and car seats back. This morning I got all three kids ready for the gym/my grocery pickup, and we went to leave and my car had no seats/car seats. I texted him at work and he said he forgot. Again. I have a disability and am not supposed to lift anything that heavy, so I’m stuck all day until he comes home from work to fix it. And God forbid an emergency happen. I have a big kid, toddler, and newborn. And this happens constantly. He will put something together or repair something in our home, but leave a mess and tools in that spot for days, weeks even. I’ll ask daily for him to take care of it and he promises he will “later,” usually as he’s on his phone or video games. I’m eventually accused of “nagging” or “criticizing” as time goes on. We have talked about these habits of procrastination and/or inability to see projects through for six years, and there has been zero change. So, I clearly will have to cope with this and it’s making me crazy. I tried to set boundaries and just say, “please use the Camry to haul things, even if you have to make two trips, because I cannot keep being stuck at the house.” He told me he will start putting everything back, but refuses to stop using the van. Well, it has happened twice since that conversation. Ladies, what would you do next?",

And we all know it's not because \"they're just so busy!\" No one is too busy to answer a yes/no question about logistics. It's just rude, and everyone knows it. What do you do to protect yourself mentally from people who could not care less about how their actions affect you?\n\nI've thought about whether I'm the one being awkward but I really don't think so. Done examples:\n\nI was on vacation the last week of December and couldn't remember if my company gave us a day off for New Year's this year. I could have pulled out my laptop, booked it up, looked for the link to the employee handbook, searched through it until I found the holidays, and then found my answer. It would have only taken my 10-20 minutes. But I also knew my co-worker probably remembered and could tell me \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"hm not sure\" in 10 seconds. I texted her a few days before the 1st. It's now January 3rd and she has still not responded. Obviously I just looked it up, but it's annoying that she never responded. I only text her every few months, so it's not like I'm constantly texting her for stupid stuff. We used to get along, but a few months ago she was extremely rude to me out of nowhere. She acts friendly to my face now, but I'm going to start keeping my distance because she's clearly not that nice.\n\nThat incident made me realize how many people have left me on read or been shitty in general this year. I'm so sick of basically everyone in my life. This year I tried to reconnect with a girl in one of my friend group chats since we haven't talked one-on-one on a while. She told me her husband got a new job, so I asked how he liked it. Just a general pleasant question to catch up. She has left me on read since September. WTF. No one is too busy to text back for 3+ months, and I have no intention of messaging her again so I guess that friendship is over.\n\nI'm also stuck in two group chats with people I'm not even really friends with. Both groups ignore most things I say in the group chat. Only one person in each group chat ever contacts me directly. I don't know how to get out of these group chats.\n\nI have more examples like these, but this post is getting long. How do you deal with getting stuck in crap group chats? How do you deal with how rude people/\"friends\" are lately? I do some social things but I'm honestly exhausted and anxious about letting more crap people into my life. Any advice?",

I’m 5”9 and about 155 pounds but my fat percentage is about 35%. I’m suffering from anxiety, on and off mildly depressive episodes. I’m in a poor physical state, my resting heart rate is too high and I feel weak, tired, and meh most of the time. I have too many ailments for being this young and I’m just done with all of this.\n\nI eat relatively healthy but I’m very sedentary. I just literally never work out. I take a weekly average of 30.000 steps. Exercise would be good for my mental state and my body. It’s just so daunting to basically start from nothing. I do not even have a basic stamina.

        "text": "Hello wise women of reddit!\n\nI'm looking for advice on how to ask for a raise. \n\nI've been with my company for a over a year now, and have my yearly review coming up. When I joined the company, I originally came in as a senior, but within two weeks I was the only person left on the team, and got promoted to team lead. I was inexperienced at the time, and accepted the salary increase that they offered. Now I think I warrant a higher salary, but I'm not sure.\n\nPossible reasons for:\n\n* My take on it is that the original salary was for my level of experience. I have now gained experience and have more responsibilities. \n* When hiring new members of the team, we realised that our salary scale was too low for what we needed, and increased it. My current team member now earns €5k more than me a year.\n\nPossible reasons against:\n\n* I live in South America, so my salary is actually very good compared to my living expenses. I don't think this will come into play, but I'm not sure. My team member earning more than me lives in an expensive city.\n* I work in a tech company, and the purse strings are a little tight at the moment.\n\nCulturally, I find it very hard to \"sell\" myself, and to talk about money. I have never had a conversation before about salary in a job that I already had, as I just accepted any increases I was offered, so this is very new territory for me. \n\nI would like to get better at these kind of conversations, and don't want to undersell myself. I have googled the bejaysus out of this, but a lot of what I found didn't really feel like it would fit for me.\n\nDoes anyone have advice?",

I like the industry in general, but after working from home especially the last few years, it's really made me consider whether this type of job is best for me and my mental health.\n\nSpecifically, I'm interested in a career as a radiation tech. Main reasons being:\n\n\\- I wouldn't need a BA to get started, and it looks like the salary is comparable to where I'm at now so I won't take a significant pay cut when I take the leap (I'm currently at 88K living in suburban PA)\n\n\\- It looks like the work-life balance is also better than most healthcare careers. I'm aware of the tough parts that the job would entail too (mentally), but I imagine any fulfilling or rewarding job comes with this at times.\n\n\\- A more rewarding, impactful job where I'm on my feet would be better for my mental and physical health, respectively\n\nHas anyone else here done a significant career change, specifically where you had to go back to school? Did you ever regret your decision? My initial student loan debt isn't paid off, so that's really where my hesitance comes from. On the other hand, I'd hate for that to be what keeps me from something that could really be an impactful life change. Also open to hearing about anyone else's experience in the rad tech field.

My worth = what my job title is, plain and simple and I need it to not be. Its not even about how much money I make, its about the title. \n\nI'm 42, just transitioned to IT 2.5 years ago, got one (apparently useless) certification, work entry level helpdesk (which makes me sick to the stomach if I think about it for too long) for about 2 years. I tried for advancement at work and failed, and it destroyed me. Ever since then its just been this self-inflicted pressure on me to do better, and I can't. Certifications take longer for me to get apparently, I can't study for them in 1 week and pass them like some, which adds to the weight of the pressure. \n\nI know I should be mid career something by this age, but I'm not. Every single second of the day I have something in the back of my head screaming at me that I'm wasting time by watching my favorite show instead of studying or going to sleep at 10:30 instead of getting as little sleep as possible by doing some lab or researching or job hunting. I'm mad at myself for not finding a new job in the 4 days I got off over the Christmas holiday...for some reason. \n\nI can't give myself a break at all, I need to really separate myself from who I am career wise, and honestly I don't know how to do it. I can't even enjoy the things I do outside of working or dealing with the job. I have 3 comics I want to draw/write mostly already created and I can't give myself the time anymore to do them. I haven't drawn in ages, just feels like a waste of time when I could be studying, learning a scripting language, job hunting...something.",

I’m closing out my 20s with nothing to show for while my peers are thriving in comparison. 30s are a time to reflect on the work you put in the past decade and enjoy the fruits of your labor but I predict that won’t be the case for me until at least 40 (career progression / financials). \n\nI know it’s silly to be caught up on the number, especially when this sub is filled with widely intelligent, successful and kind women of all sorts of backgrounds over 30. I think if I had achieved most of what I wanted at this age career wise especially, I wouldn’t care as much. It would be just another year. Since I haven’t, though, it’s weighing on me harder than ever.\n\nI guess another huge part of it is that my parents are immigrants from Europe that moved to the U.S for a better life only to end up in dead end jobs, still having to work well into their retirement years. Different times and all that, I get it, but I hear and see the regret they’re filled with daily and terrified I’ll end up in their situation. I should have planned better by now. \n\nIf anyone asks me next year, I’m 29.99999 and will continue to be for the next decade.

I just don’t want to have offended someone.\n\nSo, A former colleague (30F) and I (34M) had a pretty good relationship when we worked together. One time, early in our relationship when we were talking in a pub, she made a joking comment about wanting to be my second wife. I played it off, but it definitely made me feel pretty great, not going to lie.\n\nI’m in an open marriage. It’s not just me; it goes both ways. I don’t use it much at all, but if I find someone I like, I spend time with them and, if I’m going to go for it, I make an effort. They always know up front that I’m in an open marriage, so it’s not like I’m using them to cheat on my wife.\n\nAnyway, nine months into knowing each other, we no longer work together, but we stay in touch. We meet up for brunch every now and then. We alternate who pays. We text. She laughs at my jokes. At one point we discussed working remotely together. We talk about sex (she’s pretty open about that stuff), consent, etc., too. Not that talking about sex means she’s interested, but at least I would have thought that being open about that stuff would make being rejected a no-hard-feelings type of thing.\n\nRight.\n\nSo, we’re due for a catch-up and I sent a message late in the morning on New Year's Eve: **“Can I take you on a date in the new year? Nothing crazy, but something more than just a catch up.”**\n\nThat night, she replies at 2am, **“Happy New Year (heart hands emoji x3). Here’s to 2023.”**\n\nThen she responds to my message: **“Oooh this is intriguing.” “What’s the intention?”**\n\nI reply (a little inebriated... it's New Years): **“I don’t know. Maybe I’ll shoot my shot… or… we could just hang out and be cool.” “I don’t know the intention yet.”**\n\nThen I put out my idea for the date and say **“Because it’s a date, we’re doing it old school, so everything’s on me.”** She put a laughing emoji on the message.\n\nBut… I didn't hear anything back. I let it sit for about two days then I followed up:\n\n**“Would you be interested? (Nobody has to shoot any shots (cold sweaty forehead emoji), it’s just nice to have a new experience with someone)”**\n\nHaven’t heard back. I’m not texting anything else. I’m just going to leave it, but I would like to know if any of this seems out of bounds or offensive.\n\nI’ve got my own theories about why I haven’t heard back. Maybe she actually does like me, but the whole being married thing means that the relationship can never be more than a thing, so why get started in the first place. But that’s me being presumptuous.\n\nMost importantly, I just don’t want to have offended someone who I really appreciate.\n\nAlso... Is it normal for a guy to be nervous about offending someone when they ask a woman on a date? Maybe it's an anxiety that I need to work out.",

        "text": "In need of some support with my current situation. I’ve (37F) been with my bf (35M) for a little over a year. \n\nIn the beginning of our relationship, we would essentially see each other every free moment we had, which was not very often considering our schedules. When together we would would spend 2-3 days together. Since this was my first LTR in awhile, it was overwhelming for me to spend so much time at once with him. I also need lots of down time to re-energize. I told him I needed some space and he was understanding, but I still felt pressure to see him on those days as our time together was limited. He would also text non-stop, send multiple messages a day on social media, always want to be in constant communication. After I told him my worries, he mentioned to me that once he realized he wanted to give us a shot, he started seeing a therapist because he wanted to be the best version of himself for us. He does suffer from depression. I was flattered and this made me like him even more. We went on a few trips together, and somewhere down the road everything he did started annoying the hell out of me. I thought for sure this was a huge sign that we should be done, as I couldn’t even stand to be in the same room with him. I told him I didn’t want to be together anymore. His response was that he was in love with me, and that he loved me (9-10 months in). Again, I was flattered and also shocked but told him I needed some space and time to think about what was happening. I didn’t enforce the boundaries I set, and he didn’t respect them either. So we kept seeing each other. Maybe I was hoping I would change my mind.\n\nDuring this time, he kept up his usual communication, trying to make several plans for the future. He was clearly in denial of my feelings. Then after another cycle of me asking for space and boundaries being overstepped, I broke it off with him over the phone. He text me a week later saying how much he missed me and how hurt he was and that he wanted to talk. I agreed to talk to him in person. I thought we were going to discuss why I broke things off, but instead he came into the conversation trying to convince me to get back together. I guess he caught me at a vulnerable time, as I had a big event the same week he was supposed to attend with me, and I took him back. \n\nThese things keep sticking:\nHe’s in denial of my feelings towards him\nHe compliments me nonstop, always tells me what I want to hear\nHe needs constant reassurance\nOur lifestyles are not compatible\nI’m always the one bringing up my concerns about us. He has never ever brought up a single concern. (Yes, I have mentioned to him and said he doesn’t have any).\n\nThis entire time I have been thinking I was 100% the problem, that I have been pushing him away because of my past (not entirely false). I know I’m a reasonable, aware, and intuitive person; however, I’m now realizing all of the above after having some alone time over the holidays, and I just can’t help but feel so damn manipulated.\n\nI’ve decided to finally end things once and for all but I don’t want to break up in person/over the phone. I don’t think I’m strong enough to tell him no once he tries to convince me to get back together. Considering I’ve already tried to end it in person/over the phone with failure, what’s the best way to say goodbye? Anyone experience anything similar? Appreciate any non-judgmental feedback and/or guidance.",

        "text": "So my general question is if I show that I’m generally avoidant to being the “top”/dominant person can I ever really regain/acquire that image or do I have to start out strong and kinda ease my way out of it? Also how does one come across as dominant without being scary (like is it tone, a body language thing, about building trust, is it something that you determine and I can’t really affect once it’s set)? \n\n\nBackground: So probably a dumb question but it’s on my mind and I’d like the opinions of women who have a decent dating history. I guess I’m looking for guidance as well as an answer.\n\nSo long story short I (23m) got out of a relationship with my ex (24f) a few months ago and she said something that stuck with me. She said “I’ll always be the top and you’ll always be the bottom. You can be the dominant bottom or submissive bottom but I’ll always be the top.”. \n\nThat really bothered me because when I asked her why she basically gave me a “You’re just not that guy”. I would’ve been mad if I wasn’t so curious as to what she saw that I was probably blind to. Truth be told I’m a very serviceable guy, if I can avoid coming across as dominating or intimidating I generally will because I grew up in a household where fighting and violence was a requirement and I’d prefer not to be like that.\n\nI think my general problem is I really hate fear from women. Like 2 memories that stand out to me is when my most recent ex saw me wake up angry and she dang near curled into a ball out of fear (I was mad that the room was dirty and went to the gym to cool off) and she was convinced I was mad at her. The other time was similar where I had just woken up “on the wrong side of the bed” and my other ex looked the same way. Like I don’t think I’m an intimidating person but both had this look that made me want to go “Seriously? You really think I’d harm you?”. \n\nAnyway I know fear and dominance don’t go hand in hand and don’t necessarily equate to one another but I have a fear of just coming across as scary when I just want to come across as desirably dominant (if that makes sense).",

        "text": "So this is long but holy cow I need a good vent. \nMy boyfriend is very clingy. He literally told me yesterday that “When you’re not home I’m literally like a puppy waiting for you. I’m so bored without you”. We live together. My free time is basically “our time” all the time. Everyday. He doesn’t have a job, is currently learning a trade. Rarely sees friends. So he’s home all day, pretty much everyday. I’m  in the restaurant industry. I could be off from work 3 days in a row and spend all three of those days at home hanging out with him most of the day, each day. Before I head into work it’s “I’m going to miss you so much! I can’t wait for you to come home so I can cuddle you!” All he wants to do is fucking cuddle. Before I go to work, after. Getting home at 1 am and him wanting to cuddle and watch something even if I work in the morning. 2:30 am and I’m barely hanging on, queue the “are you going to sleeeep?” In that tone. Why tf would you even ask me that? Please leave me alone. I feel like a bi**h writing this but I’ve been getting so annoyed lately. \n\nI don’t go out much. When I do I feel the need to run it by him because it’s such a rare occurrence and he’s always just expecting us to be together. If I tell him I’m off he always says “yessss! I can’t wait to hang out with my girl!” Which used to be so cute until I realized that he expected to spend every single one of my days off together. I almost feel like I have to ask his permission if I want to disrupt that routine. If I go out with friends, he’s texting me throughout the evening to check on me and will get bothered if I’m not as responsive as he would like. I had a girlfriend comment on this before and she had a point. I had just left him, was going home to him and had set aside a couple of hours for girl time. And there he is, “how are you? “ and trying to start a full blown conversation about what I’m doing via text 20 minutes after I get there.  \n\nI crave my own space. I’m so tired of waking up and feeling his neediness almost immediately. I don’t want a puppy. I want a partner, a man with a life of his own outside of me. Who doesn’t think it’s attractive to describe himself as a puppy with nothing to do but wait at home for me…. Who won’t get offended if I want to spend time to myself or just do something without him. I feel like I just go to work and come home to him. I told him he needs some hobbies but he’s obsessing about this trade and is saying he’ll be making money soon. So everything is for after that happens. Then he says he’ll start investing time and money into hobbies. I just want to know, how would you ladies handle this? Is this salvageable situation or am I ridiculous for putting up with this ? He’s 32. There’s other things that aren’t quite great in our relationship and it’s been over a year of us dating. I moved in because of an unexpected situation, I told him that I was only moving in with him temporarily until I get another place. It’s been months of this and I’m so tense. Any and all words of advice/wisdom are welcome! Thank you if you made it this far!",

She also talks to her family on the phone often and the conversations are always long so I have to listen to her talk and the other person talk (because she has her phone on speaker). I don't mind it most of the time but sometimes I just want to sleep in peace. I am hoping to go on a trip by myself (something I've been wanting to do for awhile) and the same friend wants to meet me there. I am hoping to book separate accomodations and then meet up with her if our schedules line up. I feel like this is the best way to enjoy my solo trip without having to share a space with someone and would make it less awkward when we decide to do separate things (which will be most of the time).

On top of the collective aging we have done in the pandemic, treatment has created a serious schism in who I see in the mirror. Let alone photos. I’ve been investing in skin care, whitening my teeth, becoming more active, loving my body for what it got me through, etc. I know with time I will adjust. But photos are so hard. \n\nI feel like when I look at others social media or online dating photos, there’s like a course everyone went through that I skipped. I’ve tried practicing a pose from a Tik tok photographer, it took me 30 minutes and countless tries for one okay photo. I’ve tried getting a flexible tripod to try during activities. And I hate them. Loved ones send me photos from activities later and I cringe. Then it takes time to build my comfort back up in my body. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips or advice?",

Do I just go to Ulta and ask them to do a natural look and buy whatever they use on me? Are there any products you live on? I’m nervous about harming my skin if it’s not used to makeup, but I also need to take better care of it. Thanks in advance for your suggestions.",

        "text": "So it’s a bit of a tricky situation. I’m 30F and in September last year I ended a LTR and got a scary medical diagnosis (adenocarcinoma in situ) for which I got a cone biopsy. I’m in the clear for now, but I’ve also got Crohn’s and I would love to have a kid.\n\nI’m now enjoying casual dating, mostly through OLD. Didn’t work for me when I was single before but now I don’t know many guys who are 30plus and single. Also not gonna go to the bar every week lol. Although I’m fine for now, the thought of dating for “the father of my child” is actually something that makes me totally numb. I just don’t know if I can do that without getting too uptight - in a way I find it scary to trust that such a relationship takes it natural course and in the meanwhile see the clock ticking and trying to trust that this person is the right person to form a family with. \n\nThe medical conditions make it extra uncertain actually. I am also considering getting a kid alone or in a co-parenting construction. \n\nI would appreciate your thoughts on this. It would seem unbearable due to time to not get a kid. But I’m not sure about my options. Waiting is tricky, due to possible more surgeries or (invasive) cancer coming back or a Crohn’s flare-up. But it can also turn out all right with both of these conditions. Thank you so much.",

        "text": "This may be a sweeping generalization but I've noticed in my own social circle as well as via social media that men seem to \"rate\" themselves as much better looking than they really are and women tend to be more realistic or even critical of their appearance. I know, I know...the patriarchy lol but what is it that leads men to believe they are such hot stuff or to even be delusional about it?\n\nFor example, I have an old friend (30M) I haven't seen in person in ages but we stay in touch pretty regularly and have each other on social media and share photos of our lives. We were talking the other day about one of my ex boyfriends from over ten years ago and we both agreed time had not been so kind to him. My friend then went on to say something about how we had both aged so well (we are early 30s so...not exactly old yet), and I thought to myself that this friend had not exactly aged that great either. He is balding, has yellow/crooked teeth, his face shape has changed a lot and not in a flattering way, can't grow facial hair. (I know this sounds mean but it's just to give you an objective picture.) He is constantly sending me selfies as if he is blissfully unaware of how weird/creepy he looks in them at times, yet he thinks he is some sort of \"tanned Greek god\" (his words).\n\nAnother example is my own boyfriend (39M) with whom we share jokes about out celebrity crushes. We used to have an ongoing joke a couple years back about how I liked Timothée Chalamet. More recently we have had a joke about his celebrity crush being Dua Lipa. At one point he got a little jealous with the Timmy jokes and I told him that these \"crushes\" are just delusional fantasies and it goes both ways, so there is no need to feel jealous over something unattainable, we're just having fun. (I've since stopped with the jokes so as not to hurt his feeling anymore.) He then got offended about me believing he could never realistically get with Dua Lipa. I was seriously taken aback...my bf is a great person but he's not exactly conventionally attractive and definitely not Dua Lipa level attractive. I told him he was being completely delusional and it was unrealistic to think we could get with any celebrities since we are just \"normal people\" and rich and famous people tend to date other rich and famous people.\n\nAll that is to say....what gives? Why do men think they are so much hotter than they are or deserve to be with women who are so much more attractive and successful than they are? Has anyone else noticed this?",

I’m trying to claw myself out of this hole but I’m struggling to love my life again. I tried to go on more dates to focus my energy elsewhere, but they were fruitless, and I got to the point where I’ve exhausted everyone on hinge in my area, so I guess I will have to be patient on the romantic front… what are some small every day things I can do to love my life again, get over this heartbreak, and make things better?",
