        "text": "Been thinking about skateboard behavior since picking up a deck.  This blog post gives some interesting numbers, like a peak of about 800N corresponding to a \\~70kg person stomping on the deck from a jump: [https://blog.3ds.com/brands/simulia/about-skateboarding/](https://blog.3ds.com/brands/simulia/about-skateboarding/).  I'm wondering about similar cases for bearing failure.\n\nPeople talk about it being possible to crack parts of the 608 (ZZ) bearings with larger impacts, especially the cages.  People often abuse their bearings though, running them wet, taking the shields out and so on.  I was not able to find any reading out there on the specific abuses these bearings take.  Datasheets are somewhat informative though:\n\n[https://www.skf.com/us/products/rolling-bearings/ball-bearings/deep-groove-ball-bearings/productid-608](https://www.skf.com/us/products/rolling-bearings/ball-bearings/deep-groove-ball-bearings/productid-608)\n\n&gt;Basic dynamic load rating\t3.45 kN\n&gt;\n&gt;Basic static load rating\t1.37 kN\n\nThere are two bearings per wheel, and wheels and trucks are pretty hard, so I'd assume in a worst case that one bearing can momentarily take at least a slight majority of the load.  Is this plausible?  It's also possible that SKF bearings also just perform significantly better at the limit than brands typically marketed for skateboards, but I'm not sure how plausible that is given similar overall dimensions, low speed and so on.  \n\nNow, 608s are probably easily the best solution since they're so easy to find, cheap and fit existing hardware.  If I felt like prototyping a bulletproof solution though, what would be some pros and cons of other bearing arrangements?  Back to back needle and thrust bearings, tapered roller bearings and angular contact all seem like options.",

The bar frame is made of pressure treated 2x4s and the bar itself is 6 feet long on one side joining an 8 feet long side making an “L” shape. The frame itself is 4 foot on one side and 6 foot on the other (allows bar top to overhang the frame). The frame is 16 inches wide and about 40 inches tall. The bar will have the capacity to seat 8 people. \n\nThe bar top is not heavy, made with plywood, stain, and epoxy. The finish on the front is stained 1x8s and 1x3 trim. \n\nIf i had to guess, total weight is probably around 500 lbs max. \n\nThe deck is fairly new construction and I’m guessing is built to code which I’ve read is around 40 lbs per sq foot live load (I’m going to check specifically how it’s supported when I’m home later).\n\nAssuming all of this this is roughly correct, would there be any problems putting this bar on the porch and potentially having 8 people sitting at it?\n\nDo I need an engineer to come and evaluate it? \n\nI never totally understood the “40 lbs per square foot” rule. This means that an average person technically just standing on one foot violates this rule. \n\nAny insight appreciated. \n\nThanks",

Essentially, a pump kicks on for a certain amount of time, pushes water to one of 4 outputs, then cuts off.  They want it to be such that every time it cuts back on, the output is in a different spot.\n\nI first thought about a hydraulic position valve, but that requires a human or computer input, and this is supposed to be an art installation.  The goal is to create a fully mechanical device which uses the fluid pressure of the pump's \"on\" cycle to determine where the output will be.\n\nMy other thought is to essentially try and create a fluid operated toggle switch, then some passages to determine which outputs are chosen.  Think of it like this; a first toggle will switch between ports A and B, and both A and B lead to another toggle which drives the fluid to an output (A goes to 1 and 2, B leads to 3 and 4).  So on the first pulse, the output is A1, and then B4, then A2, then B3, and then A1 again, as an example.  \n\nThe problem is that I haven't been able to figure out how to make a \"toggle switch\" which is fully operated by the fluid.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this?  Do these \"toggle switch\" devices exist?  Is there another way to get my desired effect? TIA!",

        "text": "Hi all, my first post! I am a young engineer just graduated and about to face a job interview with some technical questions. One that is very likely to be asked is  : what is e-motor surge over voltage? How can it be simulated in a model?\n\nNow, i have found several websites that describe the phenomena, but most of them refer to high voltages due to grid problems. I have been told that the question refers to a specific problem of e -motors. Is it due to the transient behavior thant when you switch off a motor the induced current can cause high voltage spikes?\n\nHope you can help me! Nice to meet you all :)",

I could just have the grub screw it’s self jam the mechanism, but I think it would be a nicer solution to use a component that expanded and retracted as the grub screw is tightened and loosened. Is there a component I can use that acts as a sort of rawl plug in this situation? \n\nMany thanks",

        "text": "Hello fellow engineers, I'm looking for some advice and/or recommendations. I'm working on designing a mobile liquid transfer / loading cart for work and have been trying to source some good options for the storage tank / accumulator. \n\nParameters:\n\n* Liquid cannot be in contact with pressurizing gas. The liquid that I'm trying to store goes through a series of time-consuming conditioning processes that I'm trying to cut out of the time required for the loading procedures. If the liquid can be pre-conditioned and stored it would greatly reduce the time it takes to load the liquid later.\n* MEOP: \\~200 psia\n* Liquid is a solvent that can be problematic with greased components and some seal types\n* Storable Volume: 30-50 gallons\n* Mobility: Fully built cart will need to be able to be rolled by 1-2 personnel around the factory (think mobile gas station)\n\nI've been looking into piston accumulators but so far most the options I've found that hold the desired volumes are also designed for much higher MEOPs (2-6k psia). This makes them much heavier and expensive for features I'm not interested in. I'm starting to wonder if there are other types vessels other than accumulators that are capable of pressurizing stored liquids without gas/liquid contact. Any insight, searchable terms, specifically recommended products, are all welcomed.",

I have also been using FreeCAD, which has FEM capabilities, though I'm not sure how user-friendly or accurate the tools are. I want to look around before I spend hours making sure I have usable results from an underdocumented software (not that I don't appreciate freeware &lt;3).\n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for an affordable software that can do all the following?\n\n\\- Use imported CAD models\n\n\\- Generate a reliable mesh (preferably with the capability to create finer localized meshes in critical user-defined regions)\n\n\\- Apply the necessary loading conditions (pressure load)\n\n\\- Solve for stress distribution over the part body\n\nThanks!",

I am a new engineer and I have days, sometimes stretches of several days where I get no work done, then days where it seems like all I do is work. The thing is I always have to be billing hours so even on days where I don't do anything per say, I have to bill to the projects I'm working on. There are no P1 Engineers in my dept that I can talk to to see what their experience is like, but from anecdotal experiences of some of my other friends, I know a first-year software engineer who says he does about 3 hours of work per week, and another second-year engineer at a software company who is always loaded with work and meetings. I'd say I'm about in the middle of those two, but some weeks more towards the first guy. I'd say on average I'm spending 5-10 hours per week with my head down actually being productive. \n\nI should note I WFH most of the time, but my productivity is about the same in the office.",

The problem is the sudden increase in force is causing oscillations that the load-cell picks up. The oscillations make it pretty difficult to get a clean signal from the recorded data.\n\nThe previous person responsible just put a rubber dampener in between the load-cell and the source of the force which attenuates the oscillations just about enough.\n\nA problem now came up when I calibrated the system. Due to other connections between the force source i have to calibrate the load-cell with another factory calibrated (reference) load-cell. essentially to offset the additional stiffness in the system caused by the other connections.\n\nDuring the calibration I found that there is a pretty big hysteresis present. So the (measurement) load-cell shows different loads when increasing the load compared to when taking of the load. This is super annoying and even worse for a clean dataset.\n\nDoes anyone have experience with a similar thing and has an idea to prevent it ?\n\nThere are a bunch of additional constraints like the hole deformation can't be very long (a few mm) due to the additional connections. I am essentially looking for a way to dampen vibrations without hysteresis in as short a way as possible.\n\nAny help or Ideas are highly appreciated.",

As some background, I've been working for about 11 years in various areas of manufacturing - my Bachelors was Industrial Engineering with a focus on manufacturing.  I've predominantly worked as a manufacturing engineer, but have also help a mechanical engineer position at a start up, which I really enjoyed.  For the last few years I've had a fascination with applications of natural materials and natural mechanisms in modern engineering products and technologies... bamboo use in composite panels for instance, and using algae to purify contaminated water.  \n\nSo I guess my first questions is... what is this field even called?  Is biomimicry correct?  Sustainable materials research?  Or maybe it's more than one?  \n\nMy second question revolves around what might make for a good master's program to look into to get into this field (or maybe fields).  I do enjoy the science of it, but I think ultimately I'd love to work in a development environment where I'm figuring out how to make practical uses of it a reality, so engineering still seems a better fit.  A masters in Mechanical seems like a safe bet, with maybe a focus on these types of materials or mechanisms.  Or maybe material sciences might be a better fit?  Curious for some of your thoughts, if you'd be willing to share.  \n\nThanks!",

It connects the concrete bed with the bridge lying on it.\nCompared to the mass of the bridge this thing seems really small and negligible. To may layman mind it appears to be too brittle to grant significant stability in the case of some catastrophe. It also doesn't seem to be connected to something electrical, like a measuring device — but its there nonetheless, why?\n\nIt is not possible to imbed pictures, on the other hand they don't seem to be forbidden by the rules either.
