I want to do as well as possible and was hoping other people could chime in.\n\nSome examples I’ve come up with:\n\nWhat is the org chart like?\nWhat products are being worked on by my team?  How do they generate money?\nHow to run tests locally?  What are the different test sites I should be aware of?\nAny key pieces of documentation I should be aware of?\nWhat are the major challenges facing the team this quarter? The company?\n\nIt’s hard because some questions are too broad/business focused to be relevant for an intern, while some Q’s about processes you’ll be taught anyways.",

Anyways, I’ve always been interested in physics and astronomy and would love to work at a research facility but most of those jobs requires a masters or PHD. I’m only gonna be able to get a Bachelors with this program and the counselor suggested I study something like computer science or engineering as a degree in that is more applicable to finding a career after school… my question is what jobs would I be able to do in the field of astronomy/physics with a degree in computer science or engineering? I’m hoping to get some specific answers about companies job titles that would fit the descriptions I just made.",

I used to develop but got into hiatus for way too long.\nThe new position require the above in addition to implementing the website/app.\nI figured out the UI, we’ll use tailwind which I was luckily already researching last month. My issue is with the rest. They want to use NX, payloadCMS, Next js… I have no clue what are those and how to tackle them. My last real development experience was in 2018 making an ERP solution using procedural PHP (15k+ lines).

        "text": "Due to corporate reorganizations, I've ended up on a team that looks like: \n- 2 managers, one for the architects/leads and the other for the scrum team members\n- 10 developers on a scrum team, mostly junior. \n- myself, lead/arch/designer \n- another lead/arch/designer, let's call him Tim\n\nMy job/role is ideal, and I've worked hard to get good at it and get where I am. I get compensated well, especially for embedded, and I enjoy figuring out how to build stuff, making a plan, and working with the team to execute it, mentoring the new folks, etc. I'm proud of my work, and I have a good rapport with teams that I've previously executed successful projects with. \n\nUnfortunately I now have to share the architecture/lead role with Tim. Tim is awful. He takes no pride in his work. On the technical side, he is just straight-up incompetent and makes no effort to improve. Objectively just wrong about things all the time. He either makes design decisions with no investigation/data/thought, or delegates it to a recent grad who has no idea what to do. He is terrible as a leader. In retrospectives for previous projects that he has lead himself, the entire team complained that they had no idea what the hell to do and he wouldn't help them. On a personal level, he does drive me crazy. He constantly requests that we work on a task together, but he doesn't/can't do any actual design/architecture/organization work, so I do it all and he pretends that he did an equal share. It's embarrassing being associated with Tim.\n\nThe IC developers (and their manager) often come to me and ask \"Tim told us to do &lt;crazy&gt;. Is that really right?\" Or \"what's wrong with this guy?\". \n\nI struggle responding to the developers in a professional manner. I try to just focus on the technical problem at hand, and not throw Tim under the bus. \n\nBut I'm not sure how to approach this with our shared manager. I don't have much of a rapport with the manager, since I've only reported to him for a few months and I'm autonomous enough that he lets me decide what's important to work on and how to do that work. We don't interact much because I just go do what needs doing. But I can't take it anymore. I've found two other teams at the company that would love to hire me, but unfortunately after I got that process started the company halted all internal transfers for austerity reasons. So I'm sort of stuck here, and have to make the best of it for now. And I'm stuck with Tim. Nobody gets fired for performance reasons at this company. I think you have to murder somebody to get fired. \n\nHow do I approach this with my manager? I don't want to just complain about a problem without also presenting a solution, but I have no idea what the solution is here. My best idea is requesting that we work on separate stuff all the time, but that seems very un-collaborative, and \"I'm embarrassed to work with this bozo\" is not a professional justification.",

        "text": "I've spent a decade chasing a bachelors in CS (graduated in Jan) and landing the \"dream job\" is probably gonna take another year or so of my life based on some of the posts around here. Honestly, I was determined to not give up on what I started and getting the degree always sounded better to me than working retail for the rest of my life. However, over the years I've lost the desire (maybe passion) to \"keep learning\" as I got older. Throughout the previous decade, I got myself very comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as Sass and Bootstrap. However, I could never bring myself to grind out React or Angular tutorials because I felt fine doing things with vanilla. In college, most assignments were in C++ or Python so I do have some exposure there as well. I feel like if I could actually get my foot in the door, I would be more motivated to \"learn new things\" since I would be paid to do so, but I am completely tired of learning during my free time or I'm just tired of learning on my own. Maybe, I'm just tired of the endless grind. Though, I'm starting to wonder if I just don't want to learn anymore which I'm aware is a bad thing since we're expected to constantly learn new things as developers. Besides software engineering, what careers can a CS degree be used for assuming I can't get my foot in the door or I just decide to give up on being a code monkey? I don't know if I want to work in defense, but I do have a tentative offer in that industry which claims to have 3-5 years paid training. Maybe, that's the best option for me since I don't really want to grind Leetcode either.",

        "text": "I really don’t like my current role. I was lied to about there being no on call, about it being product engineering, about the culture, about the values and just about everything else.\n\nI am quite clear on what I like and don’t like. In the interview process I was promised a lot and on the first day experienced something very different. The engineering manager runs the board. Sprints are just a PowerPoint slide with generic sounds “epics”. The board has 172 tickets in to do and over 50 in progress, 25 people on the board for “visibility”, no product owner or manager in the team and no scrum master. Tickets are more often than not just a title and I should “look at the roadmap for the main story”.\n\nOur active channels are private in a separate workspace, there is a lack of transparency about changing things. I get told “what worked for you before won’t work here” despite when asking individuals in the team of 12 they agree.\n\nRecently in a meeting held by the other arm of my division there was a mental health check where I said the culture feels divided and isolating. I got DM’d by my manager to watch what I say. When I outlined its true, how I feel and I shouldn’t have to lie he went the gaslighty way and said “oh no, it’s for xyz to make you look better”.\n\nIn discussions in 1-1s about where I’m at and what I enjoy not being here I got told “we have that here. If you talk to this person then they talk to product” and keep getting my concerns swept aside. I got told “if you don’t think you’ll stay that’s fine but give a few months notice so we can go to market” which exposes me to risk (Australia is two weeks notice to leave your job)\n\nWhen I had an offer I felt attacked for feeling how I felt and ended up staying. My coworkers are good though.\n\nI’m constantly stressed, walking on eggshells and get my concerns swept aside. \n\nTL:DR - lied to in a way about a role including UNPAID on call, the culture and how it aligns with my career goals. I am not happy with the work or culture. Should I just go for any job (got offered a higher title just frontend somewhere else with more pay. Turned it down and can grovel a bit) or just keep applying and try cope with really disliking being at a place that I don’t quite like?",

Or let experience take the wheel? \n\nI'd like to go for a MSc in Comp Sci for sure after taking a break from the bachelors , and if I'm a glutton for punishment then a PHD / really enjoy my masters. Everything listed below is something I have the GPA / admission reqs to qualify for. \n\nI'll also note that I love to learn and I love school life - so the time or the energy or the willpower is not really my concern. \n\nThe pathways I'm considering: \n\n* **Local Mid-tier Uni (BSc Comp Sci):** I'm pretty sure this school does not exist or matter to anyone outside my province but it would check off the Bachelors Requirement while being somewhat less competitive than other options and could kinda work around my schedule a bit and honestly just a really chill school but just doesn't carry any weight. \n* **Arts - Math at TOP 5 school nationwide:** This would be an arts degree but still a bachelors and a math degree to boot. Plus a balanced humanities education getting to take some fun classes around my work schedule as I love to write reports and essays as well. I work with a guy who has a math degree as well - so I know they'd love to see a bachelors of math on there as well.\n* **OSSU:** So basically with this one its entirely at my own pace and I would basically be doing an excellent job of documenting it + its waaaay cheaper and can be expedited based on my own effort. What I'm banking on here is that my experience takes the forefront but with excellent proof I can still write \"bachelors\" on the resume . \n* **Full Restart:** Basically restarting my education, retaking high school requirements that I feel might be lacking and genuinely going for the TOP 5 Comp Sci Program which is another \n* **Local Uni , then transfer:** So the local uni from option 1 but transfer for the masters program to the local top school. I believe this is possible but its obviously a gamble as well. \n\nAny feedback is appreciated - thank you!",

        "text": "Just posting for advice\n\nI (24M UK) come from a relatively poor family and faced several challenges growing up, which may have affected my mental health. Despite this, I managed to attend a good university, but struggled with severe mental health issues during my time there. This reached a peak in early 2020, resulting in two hospital visits and me dropping out of my course. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic made things worse, and my mental state remained poor for over a year.\n\nThankfully, my mental health drastically improved in 2021, and I graduated from my master's program with a Distinction. I started a data science job in the government, which had long hours and night shifts. I stayed for just under a year while searching for a better job.\n\nIn mid-2022, I was offered a job at a top Investment Bank in London, at an AVP level working on an exciting project. However, as my start date approached, several things went wrong at once and I also struggled to find a place to live in London. All the burnout from my previous experiences caught up with me, and I began to feel overwhelmed and stressed.\n\nAfter about four weeks, I decided to leave the job and returned to my parents' house to recuperate. Since then, I have been working remotely as a software engineer and using the extra time to rest, exercise, and see old friends. This has felt very beneficial for me, I must say. While I sometimes regret leaving the London job, I tell myself that the offer came at the wrong time in my life, and that I needed a break.\n\nNow, after ten months, I am actively looking for finance jobs in London again, as I am in a better headspace and eager to move out of my parent's house. I have not reached out to the previous bank, but I am applying to other similar companies. While I do mention my short stint at the previous job, I don't think it is worth much in terms of credibility.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

But the new head guy is an asshole and gave her (and everyone else) less than a weeks notice. So she has no plan. She's been in software since the 90s. Has some developer experience. A masters in computer information systems. Has worked mostly with PHP and SQL. But greatly prefers project management. \n\nHere's my questions. I've got a bunch so whatever feedback you may have is appreciated. \n\nFirst off she's 60. She's expressed some concern about even being considered for interviews because of her age. Is that a legitimate concern and if it is what can she do to be proactive about that? \n\nShe'd like to brush up on her skills and learn some new languages. I know leetcode but any other recommendations for her on that front? \n\nShe lives remotely in the Midwest and given the area the possibility for an in office job is pretty limited. Thoughts on actual possibilities of remote positions? \n\nWhat's the best place for her to search for jobs? LinkedIn, indeed, etc. \n\nAs I mentioned she was let go with zero notice, again at no fault of her own she was an exceptional employee. With that said if she took a low paying job outside of the field just for a paycheck while she searches for the right gig does that reflect poorly on her resume? \n\nFinally I know there are widely differing opinions on the job market right now but any feedback on availability of jobs is also appreciated. \n\nTL:DR New asshole at my mom's long term company let her and team go with 3 days notice. Advise for a 60 year old project manager with 35 yoe in the field looking for new employment.",

Just looking for some perspective from those who know more than I, because I am currently very lost in life. \n\nI graduated in 2021 with a degree in CS from a university in Ontario (not Waterloo). During school I completed one 16-month internship but it was more IT support work than development. \n\nMy next job experience was working at a bank for a 6 month contract. Again, it was IT/documentation work and not dev. However I found myself deeply unhappy with the job, foremost because there was very poor training and I often felt like I had no idea what I was doing. That contract ended in May 2022, and foolishly I thought I could take some time off to ready myself to get back to work. Now, before I knew it, there is a 9 month gap on my resume with only a couple months of part time work as a wine salesman. \n\nI kept telling myself I would work on side projects but I have no idea where to start and the road to re-learning how to program seems almost insurmountable, even though I thought I was good at it in school. So I have nothing to show for those 9 months.\n\nSo, as the title states, I’m wondering if you guys think it’s even possible for me to break back into the field, or if you think it’s time for me to face reality and try something else. Any advice is appreciated and I will answer any questions. Thanks.",

        "text": "Hi all. I'm studying mathematics and physics at my university and have the summer coming up. Id like to use that time to take some classes in computer science and programming, preferrably online so I can maintain my job at my university over the summer. Id like to focus on data science, I think, both because it is useful to my intended field of study and a nice back-up for if my academic dreams dont go as planned. \n\n\nI looked into a few of these bootcamp programs, but all the ones I can find are for \"full stack\" web developers. I dont really know what that entails, but I dont think its what I want. Im not looking to learn how to build a website or a mobile app. \n\n\nI found one program in data science that looks promising through the Flatiron School, but they make you pay up-front $16 which seems excessive. Ive also found some through Coursera and the like, but those classes tend to not be so good in my experience.  \n\n\nIdeally what Id like is to take 1 or 2 courses online about programming or comp sci with an instructor, but neither my university or the community colleges in my area offer this. Its all either summer programs geared towards high school students, or long term (and very expensive!) courses that teach me thing I dont need! \n\n\nAny recommendations? I am willing to travel if necessary.",

        "text": "So I'm currently on the sixth semester of my career. And as a part of my university's program on our seventh semester we have three opportunities.\n\n1. Going on exchange\n2. Working at an internship\n3. A selection course\n\n I firstly applied for the exchange program to Japan, Korea or China, as it is my final goal to land a future job in Japan. With my current score I couldn't get the offer for Japan but instead I got the one for Korea.\n\nI'm getting to the existential point that, after giving it some thought I would prefer to develop professionaly, instead of personally (such as going on exchange). I'm pursuing the game development path (don't know in which area just yet) but after giving it a lot of consideration I don't know what to do to for now. Right now I have the interpretation that going on exchange conveys some paid vacations to my college, and honestly I'm not willing to go on vacations when I can at least help my CV grow by making a selection course at Computational Graphics.\n\nI know that going on exchange is a one in a life chance of getting to enjoy your college life and working will come later, but right now I'm really motivated to do what I didn't do on my junior years, which is developing projects of my own to help my CV grow.\n\nNot completely ditching the idea of accepting the Korea exchange program, I'm also looking on what does the university offer to my career (It is Yonsei). \n\nBut do you have any advices?",
