        "text": "[Video was released recently](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/10/us/arizona-jury-acquits-ex-cop-of-murder/index.html) of the final moments of Daniel Shaver's life, a Texas man who was shot dead by Mesa, AZ police while sobbing and begging for his life. In it, Sergeant Charles Langley [barks a series of commands at the 26-year-old Shaver] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/12/08/graphic-video-shows-daniel-shaver-sobbing-and-begging-officer-for-his-life-before-2016-shooting/) including, at various times, to shut up, lay down prone, cross his legs, put his hands straight up, and crawl forward. A clearly terrified Shaver appears to be attempting to comply with the orders but is admonished several times including being told at one point  “you do that again, we’re shooting you. Do you understand?” Though, in retrospect, it's not at all clear Shaver understood what \"that\" was referring to.\n\nAfter a series of commands that lasted nearly five minutes ([during which observers suggest the police had several opportunities to cuff Shaver and end the stand-off](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/8/16752914/police-arizona-philip-brailsford-daniel-shaver)), Officer Phillip Brailsford interpreted a gesture from Shaver toward his wasteband to be aggressive, and shot him five times, behavior which resulted his [leaving the police force](http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2017/12/06/trial-ex-mesa-arizona-cop-shooting-nashville-native-heads-into-deliberations/926217001/) but, nonetheless [did not lead to his conviction of the subsequent murder charge](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/mesa-breaking/2017/12/07/philip-brailsford-verdict-daniel-shaver-killing/927052001/). This result has been [roundly criticized on the left](http://www.nola.com/opinions/index.ssf/2017/12/daniel_shaver_police_killing.html), and [the right as well](http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/454504/police-murder-daniel-shaver). The [vast majority of responses from observers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=daniel%20shaver&amp;src=tyah) express horror at the act itself or how harshly Shaver was treated prior to the officer opening fire or both.\n\nA commentary from a fellow officer (in a different police department) on the Blaze acquiesces to the notion that [Brailsford committed a crime (though he insists manslaughter and not murder is the more appropriate charge)](http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/12/14/commentary-im-a-law-enforcement-officer-what-happened-to-daniel-shaver-was-a-crime), but says that much of the behavior prior to the shooting itself was justified and complied with general principles of how police should handle such a circumstance. However, other onlookers have pointed out that [Shaver indicated multiple times his desire to comply](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-mesa-arizona-police-shooting-20171208-story.html), responding, at one point, “I’m trying to do what you say.\" The events that unfolded have been described by some onlookers as [an avoidable execution](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/11/opinions/daniel-shaver-shooting-opinion-gagliano/index.html). Other observers have added that the police were, from the outset, [armed, hostile, brusque and perhaps most importantly, made no attempt to and indicated no desire to, de-escalate the tension of the situation](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/a-police-killing-without-a-hint-of-racism/546983/).\n\nIrrespective of one's opinion of this case, this is an instance of the state taking a life when the suspect in question was unarmed, and, in retrospect, [had likely not even committed a crime](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/12/a-police-killing-without-a-hint-of-racism/546983/). The Huffington Post, after the video, has asserted one possible policy remedy for preventing occurrences like this in the future: [disarming the police](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/disarming-the-police-would-have-prevented-daniel-shavers_us_5a3438a4e4b02bd1c8c6069c). Other work, by Aaron Kovisto in the American Journal of Public Health suggests the more effective remedy may point the other way: [police shootings are less common in jurisdictions with stricter gun control](http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2017.303770). This implies incidents like the one involving Shaver would be less common (possibly far less common) if police were not forced to assume that nearly every suspect they encounter were armed with deadly and easily hidden weapons. In other words, [if scared police officers are scary](http://reason.com/archives/2017/12/13/scared-cops-are-scary), perhaps society should take steps to make sure police officers are operating in a less scary environment.\n\nThis post takes as a given the notion that police shootings of unarmed citizens is a serious public problem. As such, given that premise, does a policy response that disarms or reduces the armaments of police officers and/or civilians make sense to reduce police shootings of citizens? If not, why not? Would other responses to this issue be more appropriate or more effective? If so, what?",

As far as I can make it out without legal experience, the pertinent points seem to be these:\n\n* The investigation requested the emails directly from the General Services Administration (GSA), a federal agency. According to DW, the GSA \"helps manage US government bureaucracy and often stores presidential transition records on its computers. Trump for America Inc. used the GSA's facilities between Trump's election last November and his inauguration in January this year.\"\n\n* The emails belonged to Trump's transition organization, Trump for America Inc., a private company.\n\n* Allegedly, GSA staff \"unlawfully produced TFA's [Trump for America Inc.] private materials, including privileged communications, to the Special Counsel’s Office.\"\n\nOn the one hand, it seems that technically a government agency released files belonging to a private company without that company's consent; the special political nature of the company notwithstanding. On the other hand, to what extent is information about the setup of a federal administration allowed to be considered private property?",

        "text": "Several times today there were a mention of the FCC's preemption of the ability of states to pass laws. According to what I found this is the relevant statement:\n\n&gt;[The commission intends to block any local laws or regulations that  “effectively impose rules or requirements that we have repealed or decided to refrain from imposing in this order or that would impose more stringent requirements for any aspect of broadband service that we address in this order.”](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691344/fcc-preempt-block-state-local-net-neutrality-laws)\n\nMy question is two fold. First is this legal? It looks as though the FCC gets its [authority from congress](https://www.fcc.gov/about/overview) but many states have more stringent rules about commerce, law and many other things than laws made by congress. Isn't the entire point of our republic that each state has the freedom to create rules that better serve the people of that state? \n\nSecondly what will happen if states ignore the FCC and create their own laws. Does the FCC have some form of policing authority that it can use to compel a state government to stop a law its created? If there was a dispute between a state government and the FCC who would arbitrate it or decide the legality of it?",

        "text": "We've had some internal discussions around this as a mod team, and want to get some user feedback around whether we should prohibit comments which contain insults/name calling directed at public figures.\n\nIn particular this came up around a comment calling Donald Trump a cheeto.  We had similar issues around a John Oliver related browser extension which replaced the word \"Trump\" with \"Drumpf.\"\n\nThere are other public figures subject to namecalling too, and any policy would relate to other public figures equally.  Quantity wise though, people talk about the President of the United States far more than any other public figure.\n\nOne issue to consider is how to deal with insults directed at public figures which may be factually justified.  E.g. if one wants to call a political figure a liar based on sources showing that they're knowingly saying things which are not true, we wouldn't want to ban that.\n\nUnder our current rules, the general consensus has been that a comment which otherwise complies with the rules would not break a rule by using an insult directed at a public figure, but would if insulting another user.  A submission which used an insult against would violate the rule against neutral framing.\n\nShould this policy change?  If so, what specific ideas for a new policy would you suggest?",

However, [this article](http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/07/media/21st-century-fox-disney-antitrust/index.html) says it may raise some anti-trust issues along the way. The argument is that Disney will be acquiring 20th Century Fox and 21st’s tv networks to profit, increase their market share, and reduce competition. Both operate in the same industry and offer the same goods and services, which meets the criteria for a horizontal merger, which the article says it's more scrutinized than vertical like AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger. In comparison, it would be harder for Comcast or Verizon to acquire because they're ISPs, whereas Disney is a movie/theme park studio. \n\n[This](https://www.wsj.com/articles/disney-deal-for-fox-would-end-era-of-the-big-six-studios-1512907201) also says that:\n\n&gt;Fox under Disney would likely make fewer movies, further reducing the number of releases from traditional Hollywood studios at a time when Netflix and Amazon are aggressively expanding their film output, primarily for their streaming platforms, these people said. The six major studios released 139 films last year compared with 189 in 2007, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\n",
