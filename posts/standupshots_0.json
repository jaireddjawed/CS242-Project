        "text": " \n\n**Swami, When hell is there, why are human beings punished in this world also?**\n\n\\[A question by Ms. Thrylokya\\]\n\n**Swami replied:**\\- When you are trying to punish others for their faults here, you are also punished by God for your faults here itself. If you excuse others’ faults, God will also excuse your faults. God’s punishments are appearing as difficulties and problems in life. If you try to reform others through love without harsh words, God will also help you in reforming you through love without any harsh action on you. Every human being is a mixture of good and bad qualities.\n\n Sometimes good comes out and sometimes bad comes out. Every human being sees one’s own good only and not bad. Similarly, every human being sees bad only in others and not good. This is the reason why the human being thinks that he/she is good and all others as bad. This is the reason for God’s anger on you. To teach a lesson to you, He gives punishments for your faults also here itself. This is the reason why all the human beings are getting difficulties or problems in their lives. You shall change your faults with mental peace and without emotion. Similarly, you shall advise others to rectify their faults through loving and soft words. Then God will love you and excuse your faults without punishing you.\n\nBhartruhari says “Paraguṇaparamāṇūn parvatīkṛtya santaḥ”. This shloka means\n\n1. Everybody sees one’s own large bad as small bad.\n\n2. Everybody sees one’s own small good as large good.\n\n3. Everybody sees small bad in others as large bad.\n\n4. Everybody sees large good in others as small good.\n\nThis is the reason for quarrels everywhere in the world. If everybody wants a peaceful and happy life in this world,\n\n1. Everybody shall see one’s own small bad as large bad.\n\n2. Everybody shall see one’s own large good as small good.\n\n3. Everybody shall see small good in others as large good.\n\n4. Everybody shall see large bad in others as small bad.\n\nAll this message is for every human being in this world. I am not specifying anybody because this message applies to every human being in the entire world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.universal-spirituality.org/](https://www.universal-spirituality.org/)",

        "text": " \n\n**Journey after death**\n\nAfter death, the individual soul (*jīva*) enters an energetic subtle body and reaches the immediate upper sub-world called *Preta* *Loka.* There the soul waits for ten days for the inquiry of its deeds by God. During this period, its subtle body gets food from cosmic energy. Individual souls have different shades in their energetic bodies based on their qualities and deeds done.\n\nThe first world, *Bhū Loka,* is subdivided into four sub-worlds called *Martya* *Loka*, *Preta Loka*, *Naraka Loka* and *Pitṛ Loka*. This earth on which human beings exist is called *Martya* *Loka* or *Karma* *Loka*, which is the first sub-world of the first world, called *Bhū* *Loka*. This first sub-world is the place for doing deeds and hence, it is called a *karma* *loka*. Above this first sub-world, the other three upper sub-worlds of the *Bhū Loka* and the other worlds existing above the *Bhū Loka,* are invisible to human beings due to the unimaginable power of God. **But by the grace of God, some souls can see them.**\n\nWhen the inquiry is over in the *Preta* *Loka*, the individual soul with its subtle body, travels along one of four channels starting from the *Preta* *Loka* which is the junction. The channel along which a soul is sent depends on the inquiry of its deeds and the corresponding fruits that are to be enjoyed by the soul. The *Naraka* *Loka* and the *Pitṛ* *Loka*, which are the two uppermost sub-worlds of *Bhū Loka* lying above the *Preta Loka*, are called *bhoga lokas.* All worlds lying above the *Bhū* *Loka* are also called as *bhoga* *lokas*, which are the places meant for the enjoyment of the fruits of one’s deeds. The four possible channels through which souls are sent after the inquiry in the *Preta* *Loka* are:\n\n1. The third sub-world immediately above the *Preta* *Loka* is called *Naraka* *Loka,* which is hell. All sinners go to this world. Their souls are present in bodies which resemble black smoke. This body of smoke is called as *dhūma* *śarīra*. Note that the ‘food’ for all energetic bodies is cosmic energy itself. But for the souls in the *dhūma* *śarīras* this ‘food’ from the cosmic energy, is almost not supplied. The souls constantly suffer from terrible weakness. Very very little cosmic energy and that too very rarely, is supplied to them now and then; just to maintain the very mild energetic bodies. *Naraka* *Loka* (hell) is headed by Yama Dharmarāja. In the region just above this regular hell, special hells headed by Kālabhairava also exist.\n2. The uppermost sub-world of *Bhū* *loka* is called *Pitṛ* *loka* to which all neutral souls go. This sub-world is located on the moon. The body of the soul here is made of mild moonlight and is called as a *pitṛ* *śarīra*. Food for these bodies is supplied in the form of the light energy of the moon.\n3. The next immediate world above the *Bhū* *loka* is called *Dyu* *loka*. It is also called as *Jyotirloka* or *Bhuvarloka.* Souls who have done social service for fame on this earth, reach this world. In this world, the soul gets a body, which is like a little bright light and is called a *jyotiḥ* *śarīra*. Food is supplied to these bodies from the cosmic energy. This world lies is between *Bhū Loka* and the sun.\n4. Above this second world, exists the *Suvarloka* or *Svarga Loka* starting from the globe of the sun up to the pole star (Dhruva). It is also commonly called heaven. Souls reaching this world are those who have done good work of social service, which is not for fame. The here gets a body called a *bhoga śarīra*. Food for this body to is supplied from cosmic energy.\n\n**Once a soul attains an energetic body, material food is not at all required by its body.** It is said that the material food given to deserving priests, reaches the departed souls. But this is only an *arthavāda,* which is a lie told for a good purpose. It ensures that even a greedy person performs the death rituals and donates food to deserving receivers. It is very important to ensure that the receiver of our donation during any ritual is deserving of our donation. Donation to the deserving brings merit, while donation to the undeserving incurs sin.\n\nDo not think that the donation of food, clothes and money done to undeserving receivers is a mere waste. Actually, it yields punishment since such donation is sin. The Veda says that a receiver is deserving only if the person possesses the following two things (*Śrotriyasya chākāmahatasya*):\n\ni) Spiritual knowledge of the Veda (or of the holy scripture of one’s particular religion) and\n\nii) The lack of aspiration for receiving anything in return from the donor or performer of the ritual.\n\nThe priest is the principal receiver of the donation of money (*dakṣiṇā*) offered by the donor. Hence, the priest must explain the spiritual knowledge to the donor and other people assembled so as to improve their devotion. If this is not done, the whole ritual is a sheer waste! If the priest does this divine duty in the service of God without any aspiration in return, God will take care of everything for the priest.\n\n**Money cannot be the solution for everything whereas God’s grace solves all problems.** The merit earned in donating to deserving priests protects the departed soul as well as the performer of the ritual. I am not saying that the ritual should not be performed. \\*\\*What I say is that the ritual must be performed properly with perfect knowledge of the background (\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Jñātvā kurīta karmāṇi—\\*\\*\\***Gita).** **By doing the rituals perfectly, good fruits are attained and the punishment for the sin of doing the rituals wrongly can be avoided.**\n\nFor souls who are on the path of *pravṛtti*, which is the path of worldly justice, we discussed the four channels along which they are sent depending on their good and bad deeds on earth. These four channels are limited to the *Bhūloka*, *Bhuvarloka* and *Suvarloka*. The individual souls after enjoying the good and bad fruits of their deeds in the upper worlds or the sub-worlds of *Bhū* *Loka*, return to earth. **This cyclic rotation always continues in** ***pravṛtti***\\*\\*. In the path of\\*\\* ***pravṛtti***\\*\\*, there is no spiritual knowledge or devotion to God. There is only doing good deeds to serve society and avoiding bad deeds which harm society.\\*\\* Social service is the highest merit in this field.\n\n[https://www.universal-spirituality.org/images/banner480\\_b3\\_v2o.jpg](https://www.universal-spirituality.org/images/banner480_b3_v2o.jpg)",
