        "text": "In an effort to get back into OP I began watching the various specials and movies I'd skipped before. \n\nI'd skipped Nebulandia not only because I was more keen to press on with the main story, but also because taking a diversion for a Foxy story was really unappealing to me. Being brutally honest, whilst I think his DF is interesting and his fight with Luffy fun, Foxy for me was always a poor man's Buggy the Clown and the Davy Back Fight arc (in the anime at least) was a real chore to watch through. The fact that Foxy returned for unmemorable filler stuff thereafter inclined me to put this special on the back burner for years. After all, imo, the over whelming majority of the anime exclusive specials tend to be mediocre at best.\n\nThis special however really impressed me. Whilst in my view, not as good, it is a spiritual succesor to the G8 arc in so far as it is a filler story that manages to be engaging and entertaining, doing interesting things with the characters and worldbuilding without stepping on the toes of the main storyline.\n\nThe villain was a stratagist whose entire gimmick was he DIDN'T have a DF ability to fall back on, nor was he just incredibly powerful with Haki. He could fight up to a point but he relied upon his intelligence and exploiting tactical advantages.\n\nFoxy...actually got *character* development in this special that made him far more likable in my eyes.\n\nLuffy was *pushed* quite hard as far as the specials are concerned, with the climax being far more dramatically effective than glorified filler has any right to be. \n\nAnd he special also let the Strawhats outside the Monster trio shine quite a bit by essentially sidelining 2/3 of the trio.\n\nI'm curious to know what others think about this special. Whilst I think those who want to work thru the series as quickly as possible should still skip it, I also think that, if you on the fence about bothering with this one, it might actually be worth your time.",

And if you're gonna say that Dori and Brogy don't know who Big Mom is due to their duel that doesn't matter because Oimo and Kashi are also there and they most certainly know . Also I wanna clarify that I am not hating Kidd with this theory , he's not my favorite or anything but I like him and I do recognise that he's probably in the top 20-30 characters in the series strenght wise , it's just that I don't think him , Killer and their crew can beat Shanks , The Big Officers , the allied crew and however many Giants Shanks brings",

Law said ‘You took the words right out of my mouth’ when Blackbeard said he’d be taking Law’s Poneglyphs, indicating Blackbeard has some of his own. Blackbeard will beat Law and take the Zou and Wano Poneglyphs, meaning he’ll have all 4. Law will escape while Blackbeard returns to Hachinosu.\n\nIn a similar vein, I think Shanks has the Zou and Fishman Island Poneglyphs. He said that Kidd has the chance to give him his Road Poneglyphs and leave, indicating Shanks has some Road Poneglyphs but still needs some more. He’ll beat Kidd, get the Whole Cake Island and Wano Poneglyphs, and head to Laugh Tale while Kidd gets left behind on Elbaf. \n\nMeanwhile, at the end of his Egghead Island escapades, Luffy will get the Fishman Island Poneglyph from Vegapunk, or from somewhere in the lab, since Vegapunk mentioned he was researching Poneglyphs. He’ll have all 4 Road Poneglyphs but will stop at Elbaf to drop off Vegapunk(s) and have a mini adventure. He’ll also meet up with Kidd, while Law escapes there after being beaten, and they all share information.\n\nIn Hachinosu, Garp fights through Blackbeard’s commanders and rescues Coby. However, Blackbeard himself returns and kills Garp using underhanded means, then leaves for Laugh Tale. This news reaches Morgans and Vivi, who manage to locate Luffy in Elbaf and give him the news. Wanting to both meet with Shanks and take down Blackbeard, Luffy heads to Laugh Tale.\n\nSomewhere else in the world, Buggy finds out where Laugh Tale is. Don’t ask how, it’s Buggy. Unaware that others are also on their way, he goes to Laugh Tale to get the One Piece before everyone else.\n\nLuffy, Blackbeard, and Buggy head to Laugh Tale, unaware that Shanks is already there, waiting for them. A clash between the Four Emperors is about to occur……\n\nMeanwhile, Akainu crushes another cigar and rants about how he still can’t do anything. Poor guy should have just stayed a normal Admiral.",

Also, him having a fruit that monopolizes devil fruits and setting up a system to monopolize devil fruits means he will be able to more readily control the power system and stop any rebels with a mera mera or gomu gomu no mi from appearing again to threaten his rule.\n\nEven if the WG is tyrannical now, they are nowhere near as potentially efficient.

Neutral option because it could be self-serving or benevolent.\n\nLuffy-\"he has the Nika fruit I stole\" is the thing he would most likely say.

        "text": "One Piece Chapter 1074 is titled Mark III.\n\nThis is obviously hiding something so I kinda dig into some wikipedia.\n\nBible\n\nMark 3 is the third chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It relates a conflict over healing on the Sabbath, the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, a conflict with scribes and a meeting of Jesus with his own family.\n\nIn verse 4, Jesus asks the people \"Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?\" After healing a man with paralized hand.\n\nFor those who are not familiar, Bartholomew is one of the 12 apostles, they were also declared as apostles in this chapter of the bible, verse 16.\n\n\nSpace Suit\n\nThere was a space suit introduced by NASA named Mark III or MK III and was tested on 1992. \n\nThis is probably a foreshadowing by Oda where in story woukd expand in space.\n\nThere are other technologies wherein they use the name Mark III like in vehicles and weapons.\n\n\nKuma's Race\n\nWith the recent revelation, I am thinking that Kuma's race is similar to the Herbews who were enslaved by Egypt in the Bible. Notice that Kuma always held a bible in his hand even when he was a Shichibukai but it was gone when he was enslaved.\n\nIn Chapter 1067, Kuma was rescued by the revolutionaries but as they ask him what he saw, he started running back to Marijoise. I think there is something important in the Bible so he needs to retrieve it somewhere from Marijoise.\n\nI believe he was raised by a celestial dragon or he might be a celestial dragon or accepted the status. He might led his race to escape slavery and ruled over them. He was casted out of the holy land and was then portrayed in the news as a tyrant king. Maybe his race were wiped out because of his actions. That is why his paw bubble is full of misery as Vegapunk said that it might kill someone who touches it.\n\nThere were parallels with him and Doflamingo, like when they arrived at Marineford, they were viewed together. \n\n\nAncient Kingdom\n\nWith recent story reveals parallels with the Bible, I think the ancient kingdom is Babylon in real life. It was said that Babylon was a evil wicked city who rejects on true God. Thus, God casted and destroyed this kingdom.\n\nBabylon means Gate of God.\n\nBabylonians were constructing a tower they called Tower of Babel. They believed that they can be near God (Marduk) if they built it. But the true God didn't like them building a tower so He gave them different languages.

I just need to share my thought. One Piece is in Israel. (Pun intended)",

Teach was looking for Luffy, Law and Kid, he wanted to steal their poneglyph rubbings. When Kid has lost his, there is no reason for Blackbeard to be antagonistic anymore. He will gladly take Kid's help. He wants to bring down Shanks too. He might plan to cross Kid later. Kuzan is certainly trying to cross Blackbeard. He will do so when Blackbeard and Kid land on Elbaf to end the Redhair Pirates. So when Blackbeard fights Shanks, Kid battles Kuzan. \n\nLuffy will beat Akainu. Kid is chasing Luffy's achievements. Luffy beat Cracker and Katakuri, Kid injured a Sweet Commander. Luffy beat Kaido, Kid (and Law) beat Big Mom. When Luffy defeats Akainu, Kid will defeat Kuzan. The Fleetadmiral and the former Admiral are as close in strength and fighting style as Kaido and Big Mom. They had the same position once, like the two Emperors. \n\nAlso, Kid and Kuzan both lost extremities and compensated with their Devilfruit powers. Kid lost his arm to a Redhair Pirate, Kuzan lost his leg to Akainu (Red Dog). Kid made himself a new arm out of metal, Kuzan used his Devilfruit to form an ice leg. \n\nI believe that Blackbeard, Kid and Kuzan will invade Elbaf at the end of the coming Elbaf Arc, which will be short.",

        "text": "Now I'm working on a mega theory purely about the moon, which has a lot to do with Imu as well, but I wanted to put this out first. \n\nThis theory reveals through narrative, and evidence, that Imu's fruit is in fact, the Moon Moon fruit, or Shadow shadow fruit, and his true name is actually Moon God Imu, warrior of restraint. Why? Read on and you'll find out. \n\n-------------\n\nFor those who don't remember:\n\n\n\"You are the moon, unaware of the dawn\" \n\n\"May your purpose be fulfilled\" \n\n\"and cast nine shadows in the night woven of 20 years\" \n\n\"and you shall know the brilliance of the dawn\" \n\n-----------------\n\nWe know the literal meaning for this. Before her death, Toki prophecised the 9 Kozuki (Momo and the 8 samurai) return 20 years after her death to defeat Orochi and Kaido, and she sends them forward in time. But is that it? \n\nRemember, Toki has seen things. Her fruit has potential for theory uncovering by fans from her dialogue and appearance. I'd imagine 830 years has dulled her memory a bit. \n\nToki was born 830 years ago during the void century. She possesses a powerful paramecia - the Toki Toki Nomi, which allows her to move forward in time. \n\nToki didn't get to meet Joyboy 70 years before she was born, and advanced through time to meet the next one 830 years later from her birth. Oden confirmed this after visiting laugh tale with Roger. \n\nWhat does this have to do with Imu? Well a lot actually. I believe Toki's prophecy may actually be pointing to Imu as well. \n\n\"You are the moon, unaware of the dawn\" - this is the big one, because what comes at dawn? THE SUNRISE!! Sunrises are crucial to all cultures, but especially Japanese, and usually relates to a new beginning, a new age, and the rise of hope. In this quote, Luffy would be considered the dawn, and Imu the moon. Imu is unaware of the liberative power of freedom Luffy will bring to his doorstep. He is doubtful that Luffy will actually be able to topple his grip on the world. This line acts as a threat to Imu, a warning. \n\n\"May your purpose be fulfilled\" - this purpose relates to Luffy, the current Joyboy, liberating the world from the restraints of Imu and the world government. \n\n\"and cast nine shadows In the night woven of 20 years\" - if only this was 10, I could have related it to the straw hats... But thats not possible unless a straw hat dies before Imu is defeated. \n\nSadly this is a hole in the theory and I acknowledge that fact. I hope I can come to an answer for this that relates to the theory. \n\n\"and you shall know the brilliance of the dawn\" - this us Imu's fate. He underestimates the straw hats, and in turn will ultimately be the one who is defeated by them. He doesn't recognise the brilliance of the straw hats, and the brilliance of freedom and liberation. \n\n-----------------\n\nIf Imu is the moon, or more precisely the darkness of the moon, it could give clues as to what power he truly possesses. The power of shadows, not to be confused with Blackbeard's dark dark fruit, no I believe that the shadow shadow, or moon moon fruit will be different. I'm guaranteeing its a mythical zoan like the Nika Fruit, and when awakened, it will transform the user into the moon god, or the shadow God. \n\nWhat exactly it does, I don't know nor can I guess at this time but as more chapters come out, we may get some hints.",

Shanks lost his arm WAY before the events of Higuma, Luffy and the Sea King.\n\nBeing a Yonko, he wouldn't be respected by other pirates or the rest of the Yonko, that's why Benn Beckman ate the Arm Arm No Mi to literally become Shanks left hand, being able to go from his arm form to his human form at will (that's why Shanks had two arms when meeting Ace). And that's why Kizaru didn't felt his presence at Marineford (he's an arm).\n\nBut some will say: \"Dude, Benn Beckman is literally Shanks right hand\". And that's where another part of my theory takes place. Shanks is obviously evil because he did some shady stuff (talking with Gorosei and to some random giant like with Luffy and saying he has to reclaim the One Piece) and he obviously needs a double agent to fulfill his plans. That's the role of his REAL right hand: Con D. Oriano (he infiltrated the Marines and the Strawhats). The myth, the legend. In fact, at the end of the series, when Shanks reveals his plans and Sanji has cooked Beckmann in his arm form, Con D. Oriano will appear again to make the hard choice to follow his captain or side with Luffy, because he's also a Strawhat.",

Luffy, we were also being introduced to his Devil Fruit power, a Rubber-Paramecia that changes his body into rubber, letting him stretch like rubber. Duh.\n\nOn the surface, the power doesn't seem impressive (for a main character, that is) especially when I was so used to characters like Superman, but Luffy managed to turn this superpower into something absurdly powerful and versatile.\n\nHowever, in chapter 1044, the Five Elders revealed to us something shocking, &gt;!Rubber-Rubber fruit is actually Human-Human fruit: Model: Nika, a Mythical Zoan-type that allows Luffy to transform into the Legendary \"Sun God\" Nika.!&lt;\n\nNow I'm not against this idea. I'm a casual enjoyer. But I cannot help but think to myself that this was a case of Great Idea, Bad Execution.\n\nHere's why;\n\nDuring the war in Marineford, Whitebeard made a speech about killing Ace (or anyone with the middle initial \"D.\") won't extinguish his flame, because someone will inherit his will and carry on his legacy.\n\nLater, when Luffy fight Hody Jones, his arm went aflame, and Ace was metaphorically there with him. I thought this was a genius play on the inherited will part. Luffy inherits Ace's Will and that explains how his fists can go ablaze as if he have Ace's Flame-Flame Fruit (not literally though. Its just science, really) With that said, I thought Luffy inheriting Joyboy's Will will be in the same metaphorical sense as him having Ace's power.\n\n&gt;!But no. Rubber-Rubber Fruit doesn't exist, because it really is just a Mythical-Zoan all along. The World Government just reclassified it as a Rubber-Paramecia so nobody will go searching for this Mythical Zoan that turn you into Legendary Sun God. I think it doesn't even matter if Luffy inherits Joyboy's will or not, because when his mind finally catches up with his Devil Fruit power and achieves awakening, he will be able to transform into Sun God Nika anyway, because remember, Rubber-Paramecia doesn't exist, its a Mythical Zoan: \"Sun God\" Nika, always has been, from the beginning.!&lt;\n\nReally bad execution of the idea by Oda.",

We got Sun=luffy, we are assuming Imu is the moon princess/God, we got J Garcia saturn for Saturday. Shanks has a lot of Nordic connections and Tyr is the one armed God of War in norse mythology. Also the fact that he just went to have a discussion with the gorosei and not be attacked plus the fact that he was found as  a baby in God valley but was taken in by the Roger pirates so we don't have a concrete background on his ancestry. The only reason I don't think it could be true is because Mads was created 23 years ago and there's no one to clone a gorosei and create Shanks/Tyr 39 years ago. MADS was only created much later.",

The fact that it's used with Jango too makes me think it could be a Kazuki Yao thing; both characters were voiced and inspired by him.\n\nI'd really love to know where this music comes from, but I can't find it *anywhere* and I have no idea where to look. The FUNimation DVD's have multiple audio channels, but I can't filter out the voices for this scene like I can in most other places. Don't ask.\n\nWould anybody happen to know where I can listen to this music by itself?",

        "text": "I just reread Wano and it made me love the arc even more. Reading multiple chapters at a time was much better than reading weekly. I was glad Yamato didn't join the crew, especially because their df is the guardian deity of Wano. Luffy calling Momo his little brother like Whitebeard said to Oden made me emotional. There were so many great and emotional moments. Luffy, Law, and Kid interactions are always great. I know a lot of people had issues with Wano, but overall I think it's a solid arc. After WCI, Wano is my next favorite post-time skip arc. The only things I wanted to see that didn't happen were the Red Scabbards mourning the loss of Izou and Ashura and Zoro visiting Ryuma's grave.",

I am in chapter 100 right now and before I started I saw a lot of people saying how one dimensional the straw hats are and that fluffy just bashes his head into a problem until it resolves and how most female characters are fan service\n\nI simply don't see that. Luffy is certainly more straightforward than your typical protagonist but he also learns from his mistakes mid fight and the whole point of one piece is that all of those bad ass and grim pirates get bodied by the laughing rubber man.\n\nAlso, although soda has a tendency to draw female bodies a bit oversexualized (especially past time skip as I have heard)I think he does the same with male characters too sometimes. The characters in one piece are purposefully out of proportion.\n\nOverall this is a great manga and is shaping up to many even match blue lock and records of ragnarock in my top manga list(beserk will always be number 1)",

Yassop is obviously a strong gun based fighter. Lucky Roo has been shown using a gun. Many RH pirates have been shown strapped with guns, swords, and knives. The Red Hair pirates core group has been shown to be the most traditional in terms of being more well rounded fighters whole rely on their skills and a weaponry like real life pirates. \n\nM3, Jimbei, (eventually) Yamato, Weird3, and Weak3 are already a damn strong group with such a diverse set of powers that its ultimately more impressive by EoS. BUT nonetheless, imagine how scarey the RH pirates are if everyone just started shooting at you with hella string armament haki infused guns. And some of those haki levels are at least YC1&amp;2&amp;3. With potentially decent Observation number of members up to even FS potential in at least one or more. The rain of hell against you if the RH pirates were being completely serious. As Kizaru said when Ben Beckman showed up, ooo scary. \n\nCan't wait to see what Beckman can do. It is like Luffy and Zoro but its switched. Ben is going to be the brawler with the club while Shanks is the swordsman. I wonder if Ben has CoC, probably not? That may just remain a Roger Rayleigh parallel. How could Ben Beckmans club/gun fare while clashing against King's sword, or Kaido's club, or Zoros sword? It just seems like it would be more feeble than a high quality sword or club.",

That’s ur evidence?? Ok buddy ☝️🤓”\n\nwell, yeah, but think about it. A man who wishes to pursue absolute justice but can’t because he is an immediate servant to the Gorosei and Celestial Dragons. Why not make a secret covert ops division, more secret than the CP factions, that not even the celestial dragons have access to??\n\n“BUT KOBY AND AKAINU HAVE CLASHING IDEALS!1!1!1”\n\nI feel like that’s an over exaggeration. Yes, Sakazuki was hell bent on making sure that no big name pirate could escape, and Koby put a stop to it (well, shanks put a stop to it, but cmon let him have his moment).\n\nAkainu may be hot headed, but judging from how he responded to the suggestion of denying Kizaru’s request to go to Wano, as well as his demeanor in the cover story, I honestly thing Akainu has tempered himself, and knows that brute power alone won’t be enough, so he turns to recruit rebellious souls in the Marines, particularly Koby and X-Drake.\n\nSo now take a look at the marines who *did* go to Wano:\n\n•Greenbull (Celestial Dragon meatrider pro)\n•CP0 (self explanatory, see the revelry arc)\n\nand finally,\n\n•X-Drake (confirmed member of SWORD)\n\nThis is about everything I can list regarding evidence towards this theory, the cover story belongs to CHPT. 592.
