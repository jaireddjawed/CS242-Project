I was wondering if any native speakers or learners of multiple of these languages could elaborate on this. \n\nI plan on learning one of these languages in the future, probably Norwegian because it sounds best to me. Would it be a lot of extra effort to learn to understand Swedish and Danish in addition to Norwegian or is it true that they are practically different dialects of the same 'modern Norse'?

        "text": "Just a very brief review of the effectiveness of Duolingo. The biggest problem is that the earlier levels of most languages are far too easy. They are easy because they rely on text recognition, which is extremely easy. In fact, you can often guess entire sentences even if you don't know the language well. This is very easy to do for European languages, particularly like French and German, but you can even do this for Russian. All you need to know is basic Russian, have some vocab memory and you can guess most of it. Reproducing it is however something completely different. You can't learn languages through sheer recognition. It is at most great for revision and language maintenance but if you are not doing anything else ie. classes, the effectiveness of Duolingo is very limited.\n\nIt may be that the higher levels require more writing input, since I know the last few questions require this but only when you are skipping levels. In fact, doing level tests (with three mistakes allowed) is still my preferred way of learning as it is much harder.",

This one gets the bot to ask you simple questions and reply in kind (whats your name, how old are you, what do you like to do, etc)\n\n&gt;Hello Assistant, can you has a simple conversation with me in German? I am at the A1 level and want to improve. For each of my replies, I would like you to tell me if I made any mistakes, explain the mistakes that I made, and repeat the question you asked so that I can try answering correctly. If I answer the question in a grammatically correct and sensible manner, I would like you to ask a follow-up question in order to continue the conversation. Do you think you could do that for me?\n\n2. This one lets you use it like DeepL or another natural language translator - It will simply take a message and reply with basic information on whether or not it's correct.\n\n&gt;Hello, Assistant. I would like you to help me practice German. I am going to type message in Standard High German, and I would like you to reply. In your reply, I would like you to state \"Wrong\", if there are errors in my message, and \"Correct\" if the text contains no errors. I would also like you to print out the message I send you, but correct it for errors before doing so. Do you think you can help me with that?\n\nWARNING: ChatGPT will confidently tell you things that are totally incorrect. This is not a substitute for working with someone knowledgeable in the language. A lot of the \"details\" that ChatGPT gives me when I ask it for corrects are either wrong or don't make sense. This tool works best as an opportunity to put time into the language, NOT as a substitute for formal study or seeking out native-created input. YMMV, it's free for a reason, etc.",

How do you currently connect with others who share your interest in foreign media, as mentioned above?  And, in your experience, how effective are such tools in helping you improve your language abilities? \n\nAlso, do you use any apps to help you learn a language now? If so, what don't you love about them? \n\nMerci, danke, xie xie, gracias :)",

I was raised in the U.S., and as such rarely used Spanish outside the home. But recently I’ve been making an attempt to get my Spanish to the level of my English. My currently level is B2-Upper-Intermediate according to a test I took. For the most part, I can understand abstract conversations without having to translate in my head but really struggle with expressing myself. \n\nHow should I best go about bettering my Spanish besides reading (literature is actually my main motivation)?",

        "text": "This is, of course, a gross generalisation, but as I’m sure a lot of you already know Japanese speakers tend to be quite liberal with their compliments when it comes to foreigners learning Japanese, to the point where the phrase ‘nihongo jouzu’ (‘[you’re] good at Japanese’) has become a bit of a meme. The catch is that you risk being fooled into thinking you’re actually great at Japanese when your nihongo is, in fact, not jouzu at all. [This article](https://www.icla.ygu.ac.jp/en/anastasiia-nihongo-jouzu/) does a pretty good job at explaining it IMO.\n\nI’ve recently moved to the country where my TL is spoken (Norway/Norwegian) and whenever I get complimented on my language skills I find myself worrying whether I can actually take it to heart or if I’m just getting nihongo-jouzu’ed by kindhearted natives. So I’m curious: what’re your personal experiences with native speakers of your TL? Do they tend to refrain from complimenting a learner unless they’re actually seriously impressed, or are they generally prone to over the top gushing?\n\n(Just to be clear: I don’t think this type of ‘gushing’ is negative at all, in fact I believe it could do wonders to someone’s confidence and might actually be super helpful; it’s just something you might want to bear in mind if you’re learning a language where natives tend to do this and you don’t want to risk getting overly confident.)",

For example, I'd like to buy a cottage in Rural Quebec, but the idea of having to have awkward or uncomfortable interactions with francophones outside of Montreal gives me a ton of anticipatory anxiety.  \n\nSo, This gives me some sort of meta-incentive to learn French - and if I could speak French tomorrow that would be lovely - but I cannot find any motivation whatsoever to put in the work to actually learn. I just can't make the cost-benefit make sense. \n\nMany of the commonly offered benefits of learning aren't compelling to me. I find French culture off-putting, and meeting/interacting with new people is something that I would associate with stressful, unpleasant experiences.   \n\n\nWhen I have spent some time trying to learn languages, my shyness has been my biggest blocker. Often, despite having some rudimentary understanding of both French and Portuguese, I'm just too shy to ever actually use what I learn. \n\nThis leaves me in a scenario where my brain tells me that, in a world with Deepl and Google translate -  it isn't worth the effort.
