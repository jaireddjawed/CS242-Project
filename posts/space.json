The text is part of the prologue of the novel \"Titan\" by British science fiction writer Stephen Baxter. Please note that the text was written in 1997, a few months before the launch of Cassini and more than seven years before the Huygens landing. So some of the described details turned out a little different in the actual landing, and the last sentence of the text serves as kind of a premise to the novel itself.\n\nStill this text has stuck in my head ever since reading the novel about 10 years ago because it's so riveting. Some of the described details of the condition of Cassini and Huygens are plausible but can't be known because nobody was there to take a close look at the spacecraft, but still this style adds significantly to the artistic value of the text for me. Hope you enjoy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>After seven years of flight, after travelling a billion miles from Earth, the human spacecraft Cassini reached Saturn.  \n>  \n>Cassini  was about the size of a school bus. Thick, multi-layer insulation blankets covered most of the craft's structure and radiation-hardened equipment. The blankets' outermost layer was translucent amber-coloured Kevlar, with shiny aluminum beneath; the two layers together made it look as if the spacecraft had been sewn into gold.  \n>  \n>But Cassini looked its age.  \n>  \n>The blankets were yellowed, and showed pits and scars from micrometeorite impacts. The brave red, white and blue flags and logos of the US, NASA, ESA and the contributing European countries, fixed as decals on theinsulation, had faded badly in the years since launch. Cassin's close approach to the sun, with the intense heat and solar wind there, had done most of the damage.  \n>  \n>A fat pie-dish shape, ten feet across, clung to the side of the Cassini stack, so that the craft looked like a robotwarrior going to battle, clutching a shield. In fact, the shield was a combined aeroshell and heat shield for a separate spacecraft, called Huygens, which was designed to land on Saturn's largest moon Titan. The results Huygens gathered would serve as 'ground truth', confirmation and calibration for the more extensive orbital surveys Cassini would perform of the moon.  \n>  \n>Now Cassini reached a point in space almost four million miles from Saturn's cloud tops.  \n>  \n>From here, the planet looked the size of a quarter-inch ball bearing held at arm's length. Spinning in just ten hours,the planet was visibly flattened. A telescope might have shown its yellowish cloud tops, with their streaky shadingand complex, anti-cyclonally rotating cloud systems. The sun was off to the right, with its close cluster of inner planets, so Saturn, seen from the probe, was half in shadow. The ring system, tight around the planet, was almost edge-on to the spacecraft, all but invisible, and it cast sharp shadows on the cloud tops.  \n>  \n>Titan - the largest of the moons, orbiting twenty Saturn radii from its parent - was a reddish-orange pinprick, well outside the ring system.  \n>  \n>Titan appeared to lie directly ahead of the spacecraft.  \n>  \n>It was time.  \n>  \n>Pyrotechnic bolts fired, silently, releasing puffs of vapour that immediately crystallized and dispersed. Three springs pushed Huygens  away from Cassini, and a curved track and roller made the released probe spin, at seven revolutions per minute.  \n>  \n>The path of Huygens and its parent probe diverged, at half a mile per hour.  \n>  \n>Two days after the release, with the two craft about thirty miles apart - each clearly visible from the other, as a bright, complex star - Cassini fired its main engine once more, to deflect its orbit. Now Cassini and Huygens parted more rapidly.  \n>  \n>Cassin's nominal mission was a four-year orbital tour of the Saturn system. Its objectives were to study Saturn's atmosphere, the atmosphere and surface of Titan, the smaller icy satellites, the rings, and the structure and physicaldynamics of the mag-netosphere.  \n>  \n>And while Cassini flew on, Huygens - dormant, unpowered, a mere ten feet across, spinning slowly for stability -fell directly towards the burnt-orange face of Titan.  \n>  \n>It was November 6, 2004.  \n>  \n>Huygens  was built like a shellfish, with a tough outer cover shielding a softer kernel, with its fragile load of instrumentation. When its job was done, the outer aeroshell broke open, like the two halves of a clam shell, and the main chute unfolded.  \n>  \n>So, after being carried across a billion miles, the aeroshell was discarded. It had absorbed nearly a third of the probe's entire mass.  \n>  \n>The descent module, exposed, was built around a disc-shaped platform of thick aluminum. Experiments and probe systems were bolted to the platform. The equipment was shrouded by a shell of aluminum, with a spherical cap for a nose and a truncated cone for a tail. It looked something like an inverted clam. Now cutouts in the shell opened, and booms unfolded from the main body. Instruments peered through the cutouts, or were held mounted on the booms, away from the main body.  \n>  \n>Tentatively, the lander sought contact with the orbiter.  \n>  \n>Fifteen minutes after its unpackaging, the main chute was cut away, and a smaller stabilizer chute opened.  \n>  \n>The probe began to fall faster, into the deep ocean of air. Vanes around its rim made it rotate in the thickening air.  \n>  \n>Diaphragms slid back. A series of small portals opened in the protective shell of the craft, and sensors peered out.  \n>  \n>At the base of Titan's stratosphere, some thirty miles above the surface, the temperature began to rise a little.  \n>  \n>Gradually, the surface became visible. Downward-pointing imagers peered, in visible and infra-red light, and as theprobe slowly rotated, mosaic panoramas were built up.  \n>  \n>At last, the probe crashed into the slush. Slowed by Titan's low surface gravity, and the density of the lower air -- half as dense again as Earth's - the impact was slow, as gentle as an apple falling from a tree.  \n>  \n>The probe continued its battery of experiments, pumping telemetry up to the orbiter, which sailed onwards towards Saturn.  \n>  \n>Huygens was primarily an atmospheric probe. It had not been certain that the probe would survive the impact. And the probe had actually been designed to float if need be, for none of its mission planners had been sure whether oceans or lakes existed here, or if they did how extensive they were, or whether the chosen landing site would be covered by liquid or not.  \n>  \n>Just six minutes after landing, the probe's internal batteries were exhausted.  \n>  \n>Melted slush frosted over the buried portals of the inert, cooling lander.

That is not so. There is a slow and fairly easy way that only needs technology slightly more advanced than ours:\n\nWatch this: [Simulation of Galactic Expansion](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hNMgtRf0GOg&t=12s)\n\nStars in the galaxy are in random orbits. From time to time, stars randomly come near each other. Not enough to disrupt their planetary systems, but enough to make it relatively easy to hop from one star to the next. The growth rate is exponential, and really accelerates as you approach the denser parts of the galaxy.\n\nIn 1.3 milion years, the [star Gliese 710](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gliese_710) will come within 10,000 AU of the Sun, passing well within the Oort cloud. We already have sketches of [at least](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)) [three](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_Daedalus) [examples](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nuclear_salt-water_rocket) of nuclear propulsion, any of which is expected to reach around 7% the speed of light. The first of these had early tests in the 1960s. If we assume that in practice the average speed is no more than 1-2% the speed of light, you can get to 10,000 AU in 8 - 16 years. Keep in mind that the close encounter will last several thousand years. Plenty of time for space probes, some missions, etc. The first people to go there might be astronauts with zero intention of staying. At some point there would be some colonists who might see the trip as not too different from colonizing other parts of the solar system, comfortable in the knowledge that if they don't like it they can go back home.\n\nBy the time Gliese 710 is moving away from the Sun, its inhabitants will honestly see that star as home. Those pepople will not think of the Solar System as home anymore than Americans think of the northern-European regions of Old Saxony and Anglia (birthplace of Anglo-Saxons) as \"home\".\n\n**A galaxy can be colonized with only slightly more technology than we already possess, and without any one person actually intending to colonize the galaxy.**","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678147834.0},{"title":"Techniques in astronomy of taking images of the sky are being used by dermatologists to monitor melanoma in high-risk patient who have their full body photographed.

Based on what we know of astronomy and life, aliens should have already conquered the entire galaxy and they should have been right here on Earth before humans even evolved. Forget radio astronomy, forget the \"Wow\" signal, and forget SETI funding. Instead ask yourself why aliens are not literally right here on Earth right now.\n\nIf you just figure out why aliens are not right here on Earth right now, you will essentially have solved the Fermi paradox.\n\n* You think maybe planets with life are rare? --- See the [Rare Earth Hypothesis](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rare_Earth_hypothesis).\n* You think aliens don't develop technology?

There are numerous possible solutions to this conflict, like for example, that aliens destroy themselves, that aliens dont exist, they are too far away, they are more alien than we think...and so on.\n\nI wanted to share my personal opinion on what is the solution to this conflict. My personal opinion is that aliens are too far away, that our radio searches are pathetic, and that we probably have already detected them. Assuming that the German astrophysicist Sebastian von Hoerner\u00b4s assumptions that the average distance between civilizations is 1000 light years is correct, here is some reasons why i believe this solution:\n\n1. As far as I have heard and known, current telescopes find it extremely difficult to observe any Earth-like planets 1000 light years away or further. Take for example Kepler-452b, a potential earth-like superearth, our current telescopes find it very, very hard at the time to try and directly study this superearth. We cant study its atmosphere as it is too remote. This example means that any Earth-like planets that are further than 1000 light years away are probably currently undetected, or if they arent, they cannot be studied until we have sufficiently advanced technology. Kepler 452-b might very well have a civilization like ours right there at this moment, but we just cant actually observe them.\n2. SETI\u00b4s radio signal search attempts are honestly, pathetic, but its understandable given the big size of space. Why?- They are unable to constantly listen for radio signals on multiple targets (especially multiple planets) for decades. They can either listen to a handful (if not, one) of targets for a year or more, or scan millions of targets for only a small amount of time. We cannot listen to millions of targets for decades, as it would probably be too costly, and probably unwilling. (Why decades? Well, its a realistic timeframe to allow for a radio signal to reach Earth.) \\[source 2\\]- The galaxy is vast. It seems that SETI forgets that. A planet is not a star. A planet is a small ball orbiting a much bigger star, which is separated from other stars by hundreds of thousands of astronomical units (and time, too!). For us to ever find a radio signal, we have to just pray to any aliens that they saw our planet, and sent a radio signal directly to it. It must be pointed DIRECTLY at Earth. That means that SETI also must have their telescopes pointed at the correct time this signal arrives. Space is just unfathomably big.- Time is a massive factor that is often excluded. Because of time, an alien civilization could have very well sent a signal 1,933 years ago, and went undetected, because we simply were not at the correct time to receive it. An alien civilization could also send a signal in the next 1,405 years. Time is such a massive factor that it is in fact a potential solution on its own to the Fermi Paradox (aliens exist and they are common but they often dont exist at the same time to be detected). This absolutely must be taken into account when searching for radio signals. SETI doesnt seem to do this, and later questions why they did not find a radio signal after listening a target for 25 days.- We once scanned 10 million stars for signs of an alien radio source, by guess what? By listening to some region of space for just 17 hours, on the frequency range between 98\u2013128 MHz . Yeah, thats all we did. We attempted to search for an alien signal despite us forgetting how vast space is, how much of a factor time is, how primitive our technology is currently, and how an alien signal would even look like. And we found nothing. Then we acted surprised. We are monkeys when searching for aliens. \\[source 1\\]\n3. On me saying that we have probably already detected them, i present to you, the Wow! signal. Its not much of a surprise, but these are some characteristics that make me believe it is an alien radio signal \\[source 3 for more information\\] :- Compared to the background at that time, it was over 30 times stronger than background noise.- The radio signal matched expectations of what an alien radio signal would be. \\[source 4\\]. Its intensity gradually peaked for the first 36 seconds, before reaching its peak intensity, then gradually decreased for the next 36 seconds.\n\n[ This was the Wow! signals signal intensity versus time, plotted.](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7r6kti2v1jla1.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8e5f6297866e0176edb3c6dd7169f2f0835c716f)\n\n\\- It was detected in the frequency of 1420 megaherts, a frequency that was proposed byscientists that alien civilizations would most likely communicate on, since it is the frequency ofhydrogen, the most common element in the entire universe. \\[source 5\\]- Considering all the facts i previously talked about about the search for radio signals, the Wow!Signal matches what we would see if we ever detected a radio signal. The most interesting factthat aligns with the Wow Signal is that any alien radio signals would have to be directed right atour planet in order for us to have a chance to detect it. The fact that this..was headed directly forEarth, is a strong point on why this signal was probably aliens.  \n\\- The comet hypothesis was disproven. \\[source 6\\]\n\nThe fact that this signal was never detected again could potentially make it not alien in origin, but  considering the fact we sent our famous Arecibo message only one time, i find this unlikely to be a game changer.\n\nWith all of this information combined, i personally believe that the Wow! signal was the very first alien radio signal ever received. What i do have in question though is that it appeared to be unmodulated, which is odd for a radio signal being sent into space. I want to know what are the curving lines presented in the plot after the Wow! Signal reached its lowest intensity.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to share my personal opinion on the Fermi Paradox, and on the Wow! Signal, since it was frustrating to me to find it receive so little attention. Feel free to correct me on any information ive provided, or to clarify anything.  \n\n\nTo sum all of this up, we basically are not technologicaly advanced enough to find them, and that the Wow Signal is a strong candidate for an alien radio signal, and that i personally think it is.\n\nSources:\n\n1.

I always thought they never did because didnt ever see them bring up these problems. For example, when i read [https:\/\/seti.berkeley.edu\/wow\/](https:\/\/seti.berkeley.edu\/wow\/), they never brought up these problems to show that their results could still be proven wrong. I know now that they do know about all of this.  \n\n\nAlso, to answer the questions multiple people have asked me in the comments on just why the hell do we need to do all of this radio searching stuff, and why havent they simply colonized the galaxy by now, please read [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/coolguides\/comments\/fy9965\/comment\/fn1c3g5\/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/coolguides\/comments\/fy9965\/comment\/fn1c3g5\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). I found this amazing to read, although i have no idea how actually true any of the information in these comments are. These 2 comments didnt receive more attention. TDLR (you\u00b4re lazy), there arent any galactic civilizations because we monkeys have underestimated massively how hard it is to colonize a galaxy, and there arent any aliens on Earth because we have also underestimated massively how hard it would be to find us.   \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677851884.0},{"title":"Some of the night sky happenings throughout March.

However, of the LEO stations mentioned, the ISS and Tiangong will obviously still be around, (ISS goes down in 2031). Axiom's been making amazing progress, so they'll probably meet or come close to their 2027 timeline for a station. Not much has been made public about Nanoracks' Starlab station, though they've got a 2027 timeline so I'll be nice and give them a 75% chance at making 2030. Orbital Reef's complicated because Blue Origin so secretive about New Glenn's progress, so we really don't have much to go off of, so I'll say they've got a 60% shot at making 2030. And I have no f\\*cking clue what the Russians are doing besides the fact that they said they want their own station in orbit soon so idk 50%.\n\n\\- The Artemis program's already been ripe with delays, and that's unlikely to stop, given just how bloated and bureaucratic the SLS program is. However, my guess is the Artemis II is done via SLS, and then when a new administration comes in in 2025, SLS gets the boot, and enter Starship full time, (this is inevitable, why else would they pick it for HLS?). I'll say Artemis III lands in late 2026 or early 2027, and by 2030 the base in its beginning stages. As for China, I think they'll land in \\~2035.\n\n\\- Elon loves his ambitious timelines, but, this time he's got a reason to be ambitious. Starship is very close to its first orbital flight test this month, and from there its a pretty straight forward path. SpaceX will work with NASA in developing HLS for the Moon, and the design for Mars will pretty much be that with large fins and of course heat shields; (fun fact, Mars is the only world in the solar system where parachutes won't suffice for a landing on their own, but where you also need heat shielding). That aside, even though Starship's seen such great progress, I'm still gonna say 2031 or 2033 for a human landing, because shit happens.\n\n\\- For the asteroid mining thing, I know I'm gonna get a lot of skepticism for this one, and I get it, asteroid mining's tough. But AstroForge is a really good operation, better than Planetary Resources or DSI. They've already got $13M in seed funding and two precursor missions planned for THIS YEAR. And as for the outer solar system NASA missions, I don't see why we should expect any delays for those either.","upvote_ratio":0.59,"created_utc":1677680468.0},{"title":"NASA administrator selects heliophysicist Dr. Nicola Fox to lead the agency\u2019s Science Mission Directorate","author":"marketrent","url":"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/press-release\/nasa-administrator-selects-new-head-of-science\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677647542.0},{"title":"Col.

One focusing on the small and the other large. They  both work on magnification. General relativity addresses large objects  and the fabric of spacetime. Spacetime gets distorted and even produces  waves that travel across the universe. Quantum Mechanics addresses the  very small and makes predictions using the wave function. Please note,  there are waves in both areas of study which is where they are similar.  As with sound, radio and light: they are waves and as such, are subject  to interference, both destructive and constructive. Recently LIGO  observatory has detected gravitational waves which warp space and time.  Destructive waves are used in noise canceling headphones. With all of  these wave types permeating the universe, there is bound to be such  interference. These can potentially produce anomalies. When measuring  the universe via massive telescopes we do see anomalies. They have been  coined dark matter and dark energy. What if these anomalies are caused  by interference? Space does seem empty, yet it is full of waves. Waves  of light, gravitational waves, radio waves, microwaves and subatomic  waves. There are many ways to learn physics. Some are visual, such as  tree felling or use of Popsicle sticks and some are mathematical. I  personally am a visual learner. In physics, the term entropy is used. It  has been argued successfully that entropy, disorder or heat change will  reach equilibrium eventually. AQUAL hypothesis has some ground. What I  am proposing is dark matter is not real, nor is dark energy. People much  smarter than I am are also challenging this assumption.

One focusing on the small and the other large.  They both work on magnification. General relativity addresses large  objects and the fabric of spacetime. Spacetime gets distorted and even  produces waves that travel across the universe. Quantum Mechanics  addresses the very small and makes predictions using the wave function.  Please note, there are waves in both areas of study which is where they  are similar. As with sound, radio and light: they are waves and as such,  are subject to interference, both destructive and constructive.  Recently LIGO observatory has detected gravitational waves which warp  space and time. Destructive waves are used in noise canceling  headphones. With all of these wave types permeating the universe, there  is bound to be such interference. These can potentially produce  anomalies. When measuring the universe via massive telescopes we do see  anomalies. They have been coined dark matter and dark energy. What if  these anomalies are caused by interference? Space does seem empty, yet  it is full of waves. Waves of light, gravitational waves, radio waves,  microwaves and subatomic waves. There are many ways to learn physics.  Some are visual, such as tree felling or use of Popsicle sticks and some  are mathematical. I personally am a visual learner. In physics, the  term entropy is used. It has been argued successfully that entropy,  disorder or heat change will reach equilibrium eventually. AQUAL  hypothesis has some ground. What I am proposing is dark matter is not  real, nor is dark energy. People much smarter then I am are also  challenging this assumption. I am an ignorant person, relatively  speaking. But I am proposing, the very beginning of an idea, to take in  consideration wave interference to address the discrepancies observed. I  don't know the true shape of our universe. I am ignorant of so many  things.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677629844.0},{"title":"My two year progress shooting Jupiter, using the same $300 telescope!","author":"theillini19","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/1gtjyb6z0mka1.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677453403.0},{"title":"Why don\u2019t we put air intakes on the lower stages of rockets?","author":"Squiggin1321","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/space\/comments\/11eawzi\/why_dont_we_put_air_intakes_on_the_lower_stages\/","text":"Wouldn\u2019t it be more effective to get the air from the atmosphere when the rocket is close to sea level then switch to a closed cycle?

What he's been doing is going into the [Gaia catalog](https:\/\/sci.esa.int\/web\/gaia) (which carefully tracks the precise movement of *billions* of sources) and being great at finding \"needle in a haystack\" type things.  In this case, the thing was a red giant star, about the same mass as our sun, orbiting an unseen companion that we've concluded must be a black hole, named Gaia BH2.\n\nHow do you do this?  Well as you might recall, orbital mechanics state that if you have two objects in space gravitationally bound, they will orbit a common point of interest.  When this happens, you'll see the objects \"wobble\" in their movement back and forth over the course of their mutual orbit (which is how we find many exoplanets, in fact!)  What Kareem did, strictly speaking, was find a star with a weird \"wobble\" in the data... and that \"wobble\" indicated the star's orbit was in a period of P= 1277 days, and the companion it was orbiting would be a compact object ~9x the mass of the sun.\n\nNow, a star 9x the mass of the sun would be stupid bright, and very obvious bc this visible star is pretty bright on its own (12th magnitude).  Definitely nothing there in follow-up observations, so it's not a star.  So basically at this point, the argument is \"if only we knew of something that was very massive, so massive light doesn't escape it... oh yeah, a black hole!\"\n\nNow the trick is some black holes *do* emit at low levels, thanks to accreting dust onto them- this happens in closer star- black hole pairs, called [X-ray binaries](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/X-ray_binary).  This emission is basically created as particles get close to the event horizon of the black hole, \"feeding\" it, and how we can spot them usually in radio and X-rays.  And, well, we know this star pretty well because we can see it, and every star will have some amount of particles coming off of it in a stellar wind (like the sun does, and how we get the aurora), which is pretty well understood for stars of this type.  So then the question is- is Gaia BH2 emitting at *any* wavelength?\n\nNow this is where I come in, in my role of someone who knows a thing or two about how to get radio observations of weird black holes. :) Kareem is in my institute and came in to tell me about this object a few months ago, and that he'd discovered the *closest* period in its ~3.5 year orbit was happening *this month!* (Yes, that's a bit of luck- in science it's good to be lucky sometimes!) So if you want to detect particles interacting with the black hole, your best chance of seeing it is basically now.  Also, it was a very southern hemisphere object, so not just any telescope can look at it.\n\nSo, what I did was file for emergency time to use the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, the best telescope on Earth to do this observation, asking for a several-hour observation of Gaia BH2.  Luckily, they agreed and granted the time, so we took a look a few weeks ago! (And I have now officially hung up my shingle as a \"black hole consultant\" btw- my rates are very reasonable! :) )\n\nNow, the bad news is, we did *not* detect any radio emission from Gaia BH2 (nor did the *Chandra* X-ray telescope.) You can see the details in Figure 10 of the paper linked at top.  But the *good* news is this is actually massively helpful, because there is so much we don't understand about black holes!  For example, how does this accretion process work for emission from black holes?  Our data is good enough that we can say most of those stellar wind particles never reach the event horizon- maybe there are strong winds blowing them away, or similar.  Not as exciting as a detection, but still really useful!\n\nAnyway, moving on from that, Gaia BH2 is exciting because as the name implies, it's the second such Gaia black hole- the first being Gaia BH1.  This discovery happened a few months ago ([press release if you missed it then](https:\/\/beta.nsf.gov\/news\/astronomers-discover-closest-black-hole-earth)), and that one happens to be the *closest* black hole to Earth that we know of (and why Gaia BH2 is second- this one has the largest orbit known for a black hole though).  This is *super exciting* because it now implies that these black holes in orbits are actually rather common in space- more common than ones where the black hole and star are closer at this rate!- and the trouble is detecting them. (It's also not clear how they form, so some nice work for theorists to do.) Well, for now- the good news is Gaia is still taking data, and its next data release (in ~2026) will have a *lot* more of these stars with mystery black hole companions in it!  So, guess there will be a lot more to do!","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1676738877.0},{"title":"Layers of blue haze in Pluto's atmosphere taken by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in July 2015.
