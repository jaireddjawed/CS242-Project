        "text": "Down in Texas we don't get a lot of ice/snow, but when we do, it tends to close everything.  We don't buy all the ice equipment needed since it only happens pretty rarely- especially 25 years ago.\n\nBut, at the university, I got caught when it iced over.  It was cold.  With wind chill, unexposed skin had about 10 seconds before danger of frostbite.  That, and a solid layer of ice on all the roadways.  Not snow, but nice slick ice.\n\nLuckily, it's Christmas break, so the only people in dorms are the RAs, and they have their own kitchens.  \n\nSo, we get calls from all the other guards and as we expected, no one can come in.  This was fine with me- the roads were so bad, I didn't want to drive home.\n\nBut, after a while, we got official word that the school is formally closed.  This is good for us, because when the school closed, all employees got 8 hours on their check.  Even if you were on vacation.  Nice for everyone.\n\nI checked a few buildings, but it was so cold, I would bundle up with everything and when I got inside the building I had to leave everything in a pile by the door cause it was so hot inside.\n\nBut, we eventually got a call from the university president.  He said to call him back at his home to verify it was him.\n\nHe asked how we were doing.  Very nice- he was concerned for us.  There were two of us on duty, and he told us we would take an 8 hour break for sleeping, but they'd pay us for the whole 24 hours.  We had a suite upstairs in the student union called the \"visiting professor\" apartment.  It was like a hotel room with a bath, bed, and all the comforts of home.  \n\nHe also asked how we were fixed for food.  We both had lunch but nothing else, so he told us to just use the cafeteria and eat what we could find.  Keep a record (cafeteria was an outside contractor) and the school would pay for it.  They had a sandwich shop, so we survived on that.\n\nWe were closed for 3 days.\n\nThat paycheck was 2, 8 hour days, then 3, 24 hour days, plus the 3, 8 hour days for the school being closed.  I think that was 112 hours, and everything over 40 was overtime.  \n\nGreat bosses, bosses, boss.  ",

        "text": "In my all around town patrol job, we had to check one of those self storage places that have hundreds of overhead doors.  We were to drive through the place and make sure there was a lock on every door.\n\nMy trainer told me to basically give it a shot, but don't worry about it because the lady that ran the place was nuts.  She'd put a lock on a door and turn the lock where it appeared it was locked but really wasn't locked to \"test\" us.  I was told not to worry about it as what they paid us wasn't sufficient for us to spend a couple of hours physically checking each lock.\n\nBut, we were to leave building 9 alone.  That building wasn't used.\n\nAfter I left the business, I was near my house and I saw one of my buddies driving the company patrol car near my house so I stopped to talk to him and he related this story.\n\nSeems a guard who replaced me didn't get the whole story on building 9.  He checked it, and he found a shed partially open.  He stopped and thank God he took a look with his flashlight before he did anything.  When he looked under the door, he found a meth lab.\n\nSo, he called the supervisor and they called the cops.  When the cops got there, they called the bomb squad and the found the place was rigged to explode if you opened the door without unhooking a wire.\n\nOddly enough, the crazy lady who ran the place hadn't been seen since then.",

        "text": "I have worked many different security, surveillance, LP/AP, inventory control, and liability mitigation jobs.  I have helped develop policies, procedures, training material, and all kinds of shit.  But when I got started in the industry, I wasn't exactly on the up and up with certain things that would be called common sense by someone on the job for a few years.\n\n\nMy best friend and I made it a policy to always work together shortly after high school.  We worked at a hardware store, a large electronics store, and then a mall doing security.  Shortly after we got hired, he was placed on graveyards and I would come hang out with him so he wasn't alone.\n\n\nOn one of these nights, we were cruising around in the parking structures chain smoking trying to kill some time.  There were five three level concrete structures all connected.  Most noises carried pretty well from structure to structure.  We came down a ramp and heard a metallic clanking.\n\n\nI immediately wrote it off as one of the steel plates that cover the expansion gaps in the cement.  My friend was convinced it sounded like someone doing a kick-flip on a skateboard.  It was about 03:00 at the time, so I looked at him doubtfully, \"Dude, if there were skateboarders, you would hear voices.\"\n\n\n\"I don't know, man, that sure sounded like someone ate shit.\"\n\n\nSure enough, we turned a corner and saw some WMA skater, mid twenties, picking himself up off the ground with his board sliding away.  He was completely alone.  We pulled up and out the window asked if he was ok.  He replied in the affirmative and we asked him to please leave as we couldn't risk the liability of him skating in the structures. \n\n\nHe hesitated, but agreed.  As he walked away, he kept looking at his feet or something on the ground.  He then kicked something, looked at it and then slowly walked off.  We followed him to the edge of property and bid him farewell.  Curious, we drove back over to where we found him to see what he was looking at.\n\n\nAfter a few minutes of looking around, we find a small ziplock baggy.  It was probably the size of an unfolded matchbook; like a baggy that Ikea bolts would come in.  We picked it up and saw that it was stuffed full, like maximum capacity, with a crystalized substance.\n\n\nAt the time, the majority of drug experience either of us had was limited to the typical rich white-kid drugs commonly found in the Bay Area.  Weed, shrooms, ecstasy, acid, and the occasional coke.  Looking at the baggy, we just assumed it was meth.  We determined that this was a pretty good amount of meth at that.\n\n\nSince we hadn't been working there for very long, we decided to call the last supervisor that was on duty.  He answered on the third try, obviously annoyed that we were waking him up.  We explained the situation and he told us to go put it in his desk and tell someone about it when they came in in the morning.\n\n\nIn a few hours the morning supervisor came in followed shortly by the boss.  We told both of them about the events of the previous night thinking we did a good job.  The supervisor's face went pale and he kinda shrunk away from us and the boss.  Boss man was a short, but a giant compared to his temper.  His face turned a bright red as he just glared at us.\n\n\nFinally he popped, \"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO?!\"\n\n\n\"We found the baggy, thought it was meth, so we called the supervisor and he told us to put it in his desk,\" replied my friend.  We were both confused at his anger since we thought we did perfect.\n\n\n\"[REDATED] TOLD YOU TO DO THIS?!\"\n\n\n\"Yes... Were we not supposed to do that?\"\n\n\n\"FUCK NO!  GET [REDACTED] ON THE PHONE!\"\n\n\nSome one called up the supervisor and put the phone on speaker.  The supervisor, peeved again that he was being woken up a second time in a couple hours, just says, \"What,\" in an irritated voice.\n\n\nBoss man just starts screaming, \"DID YOU TELL DREW AND [REDACTED] TO PUT A GIANT FUCKING BAGGY OF METH IN YOUR DESK?!\"\n\n\n\"Uh, yeah, who cares?\"\n\n\n\"DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS HERE?!\"\n\n\n\"No...\"\n\n\n\"ABOUT $2000 DOLLARS WORTH!!!\"\n\n\n\"Oh, shit-\"\n\n\n\"OH, SHIT IS RIGHT!  WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!\"\n\n\n\"I do-\"\n\n\nThe boss hung up on him, picked up a stapler, and throw it like a four seam fastball into the wall.  We all just stood there, stunned.  He paced back and forth for a minute in silence and then asked if we had camera footage of the guy who dropped it.  We didn't, so he said he would just flush it, or maybe call one of his cop friends.\n\n\n\"You two, go home.\"\n\n\nI'm not completely sure what happened to the meth, but we were too happy that we made it out with our jobs to care.  From that point on, we handled all our meth business like Heisenberg: no half measures.  I quickly learned how to handle those kinds of situations, both in regards to the evidentiary chain of custody and drug offenses.\n\n\nBecause that job worked like a good ol' boy network, nothing happened to anyone, and eventually the boss, the supervisor, and I became very close friends and engaged in many other questionable hijinks.

        "text": "Hey everyone! I'm a newly appointed MOD here, so all you should kneel before Zod!  Seriously though me and the other mods are gonna do what we can to get this subreddit alive and kicking.  But for now, I'm going to start off reposting some of the tales I've posted in other subreddits.  I've worked security jobs and loss prevention jobs at a ton of different places, and have a ton of good stories.  I'll start with a few short ones at my old security job.\n\nMy old job's phone number ended in 5555.  The local Cable provider was the exact same number but ended in 6666.  We would get people calling us trying to reach them several times a week.  We would tell them wrong, number, have a good day, etc.  If they didn't listen and kept trying to talk to use as if we worked at the cable place, we would mess with them.  I have a story I'll post later about freaking an old lady out talking about tranny porn.  \n\nAnyways, besides all the calls we receive for *Cablesight*, we get a myraid of telemarketers.  The three most common ones are 1.) You've been selected for a free cruise  2.) You've been selected for a free home security system, and 3.) You may be eligible for a small business loan from the government for free.  \n\nAfter several requests to have our number removed from the lists, we started messing with them.  I mean fuck it, they are scams.  Just wanna get you to give away your info.  So why not mess with them?  Here's a couple scenarios we went through.\n\n**Security System Scenario #1**:\n\nScammer: Hi, thank you for holding. My name is Douchbag Scammer.  How are you today?\n\nMe: I'm fine thank you.\n\nS: So you're interested in our FREE home security system.  (He really liked to stress the word FREE).\n\nM: Yes sir.  I got a neighbor whose spying on me, and I want to put an end to it.\n\nS:  Oh well neighbors can be annoying sir.\n\nM: Not like this. This guy works for the government. He's spying on me, I know it. This system is just what I need. But I could never afford one. Credit got destroyed when I went to jail.\n\nS: Jail?\n\nM: Yea but that bitch deserved it. Anyways, now that I got an alarm system, I can invite him over, set the alarm, and when he trips it I can shoot him dead and say he tried breaking in.  It's the law.\n\nS: umm. Sir. I don't think you can do that.\n\nMe: Don't tell me that, I know my rights. Someone breaks in and I can kill him dead.  I'll get rid of that fucker reeeeaaal quick. \n\n*Scammer hangs up*\n\n**SecurityScenerio #2**: (I'll just skip ahead to where they ask if I'm interested in the system)\n\nS: So you wan't to know about our free system?\n\nM: Yes but I had some questions first.\n\nS: Go ahead sir.\n\nM: So this is for doors AND windows right?\n\nS: Yes sir.  \n\nM: And I can set the alarm, and still be in the house, long as no one opens the doors.\n\nS: Yes sir.\n\nM: Good. I'll tell you. My daughter just turned 14, and I caught her sucking her b/f's cock the other day when I followed them out on their \"date\". Can you believe it, my baby, A WHORE!  I tell you it took all my rage not to murder that little bastard b/f of hers.\n\nS: Uhhh....\n\nM: You have a daughter?\n\nS: N...No sir.\n\nM: Well let me tell you. You don't know rage until you see someone's balls resting on your daughters chin. (at this point, I almost lost it, because my co worker is next to me, and couldn't hold in his laughter anymore)\n\nS: Well that's a shame sir.  If we could just get your info we cou...\n\nM: I tell you, I'll make sure that slut doesn't get out there to suck anymore guys off. I'm sure she has a reputation.  If she's anything like her mother, she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose.  \n\nS: Sir I'm not really comfortable with this.\n\nM: I know I'm sorry for unloading on you.  I also want to make sure that you send a female installation tech.  If a guy shows up he better be castrated cuz he aint gonna get near my daughter.  She's a whore, and I know how these things go. If a male shows up I'll kick his ass then come kick yours.  Put your security system to the test, you feel me boy?\n\n*Hangs up*\n\n**Security Scenario #3** (Note: For this one I gave a really germanic name. Like Victor Von Shaft or something)\n\nMe: So this will connect to fire and police and EMS right?\n\nS: Yes sir it will.\n\nM: There is a way to leave a special note for my account right?\n\nS: A special note?\n\nM: Well you see, it's a delicate situation. My parents are both gone, and my grandmother is somehow still kicking.  She tends to wander out of the house a lot, and we want to keep her inside.\n\nS: I'm sorry to hear that. My grandfather had alzheimer's and tended to wander. I know it's not easy.\n\nM: Well she's not senile. She's perfectly sound for someone her age.  It's more of the fact of our neighborhood.\n\nS: Neighborhood?\n\nM: Well, we live down the street from a Jewish retirement home.  And you know old people. Always holding a grudge.  Grandma never was very forgiving after the Nuremburg trials.  Grandpa was stoic and accepting of what had happened, but Grandma has always been outspoken about it all.  It can be a hassle. You know how it goes right?  Despite the evidence, people just think this so called \"Holocaust\"  *ACTUALLY* happened.  Crazy right?  But anyways, we just want to avoid issues with her going and yelling shit at the people there.  \n\n*Hangs up the phone*\n\n**Free Small Business Loan from the Government Scam**:  \n(Once again skipped all the unnecessary introduction parts)\n\nScammer: So you have a small business?\n\nM: Well no. Not per se.  But I am in the middle of a venture at the moment, does that qualify?\n\nS: Well is it a business?\n\nM: Well. No. I'm writing a play that I hope to perform for the world.\n\nS: Well actually we can work with that I think. What is the play about?\n\nM: Well, it's hopefully, depending on licensing, going to be a musical version of Harry Potter.\n\nS: Well that sounds nice. A lot of kids would like that.\n\nM: Well it's not for kids. You see the entire thing will be performed in the nude.\n\nS:  In the....\n\nM: Nude. Yes. It will envoke the real essence of magic from the HP universe.  You've read the books right? Imagine that world, full of beautiful naked human beings, just being themselves, not ashamed and hiding.\n\nS:..... I don't think we can fund this.\n\nM: Please. You have to. I quit my job for this. Everyone else said it was crazy.  I just stay in and write all day. I'm on the last book. Im *SO CLOSE*. My wife even left me, saying I was creepy and obsessive over it.\n\nS: Well I'd have left you to.  I know you think you're being funny, but it's not.\n\nM: It's better than scamming people out of money. Let alone sticking around for a call to a security office where everything is being recorded.\n\nS: Recorded? \n\nM: Yup. Everything  logged and recorded audio too.  Isn't technology grand?  I can do all that just as easily as you steal information from your victims.\n\n*Hangs up phone*\n\n**TL;DR- I am an asshole with too much free time on his hands**\n\n",

You can tell he's drunk, and he's already known to security for driving off road on our campus in his distinctive 4x4 pickup.  \n\nHe's yelling and staggering, and stumbles on our steps rewarding himself with a fall and a nasty bloody mouth.  Broken teeth, I suspect since there was so much blood.  But, that's not even the story.\n\nI step outside to see if I can help, and when he sees me he starts going off on how security is good for nothing.  His truck has been stolen and I didn't catch the crooks.  Nevermind it was just stolen and it wasn't even stolen on our campus.  He wants the cops.  I think the cops are just what he needs.\n\nSo, when the police arrive, he tells them where it was parked.  It was about a half mile from campus in an area where there are no businesses or any reason for a person to be parked.  The cops note this, but carry on.  A minute later, another radios in that the truck is right where he left it.\n\nSo, he says he wants to go get his truck, and the cops note he's far too drunk to drive.  They're talking about driving the girlfriend there to get it, but he doesn't want her to drive.  She's saying she'll take him to a friends house to sleep off his drunk.  She's only about 5 feet tall, and he's a hulk of over 6 feet, belligerent to everyone, bloody mouth, and drunk.  I'm listening to the cops talk, and one says, \"I'm just not comfortable leaving him with her.\"\n\nSo, he gets arrested for public intoxication and, surprise, resisting arrest.  They tow his truck since it's parked on a roadway where there is no parking.  And, when searching him, they find a pipe and a \"bag of a green leafy substance resembling marijuana.\"  \n\nA few days later one of the cops stops by campus to use the restroom and grab a cup of coffee, and he tells me it wasn't pot.  This was decades before synthetic pot, but they had no idea what it really was.\n\nBut, it was enough to get him banned from campus, and his girlfriend informed that if he came back, she'd get in trouble, too.",

This isn't much of a story so much as venting, but it fits in this subreddit better than anywhere else so here it goes.\n\nHere in Canada (or just Ontario, who knows) when a security contractor takes over another company's site, they're legally obligated to hire the guards working there (if they want to stay), and to pay them at at least their current rate.\n\nAnyways, in recent history my site experienced such a transition, but the new employer flat out refused to pay us our rate, breaking the law, and refused to hire us unless we accepted less.

I go to assist.\n\nOnce there, the students are telling me they don't want my help.  They want real cops.  They want me to leave.  I can't enter the room, but I stay in the hall.\n\nWhen the cop gets there, I tell him the students don't want my help, but he tells the students since I work for the school, he wants me with him.\n\nWe enter the room, th cop looks around, and he immediately says, \"What's going on here?  Some kind of kinky shit?\"\n\nI see a young female student topless, but covered by a sheet at this point, handcuffed to the bed.  It's obviously consensual, but she is red from embarrassment and is now crying.\n\nThe students want to borrow the cops handcuff key.  He's asking all sorts of really irrelevant questions, wants ID, delaying.  I suspected he was just trying to embarrass them more which was fine with me- especially because of what I suspected was coming next.\n\nHe finally told them, \"I can't help you.  Our handcuff keys are custom made for our department, and they won't work on your handcuffs.  You need a generic key- like what the security guard has.\"\n\nI chime in, \"They told me they didn't want my help.  I guess we could call a locksmith.\"\n\nObviously, they decide they do want my help- or at least my key-, so I let the boyfriend borrow the key.  I guess I could have leaned over her myself to unlock her, but I decided to be nice.\n\nAs luck would have it, I saw the girl every morning.  I ate breakfast ($1 since I was in uniform) after my shift, and she must have had an early class and she was always there.  I tried to be professional and I never said anything, but even before this happened, I had always noticed her.  She was a cutie.  \n\nShe transferred out of our school the next semester.\n\n",

At one point the security crew drags a guy to my exit (apparently oding on some unknown substance (was lying on the ground in a nearby room, i am asked to partially ope the security door so he can get some air until the paramedics arrive, the guy comes by a lil bit and gets agressive having 5 security guards hold him down until taken away with the paramedics.\n\nrest of my shift goes without problems (appart from getting complaints from my higher ups for opening the door as that triggerd a alarm in the central office)\n\nso after that's over i go check on some colleagues now at I Love Techno all stages have a certain colour and are called \"blue room, yellow room, red room, orange room, ...\"\n\ni get into the blue room wich has one of those air circulation systems, the whole room is dripping wet. and as i stand by a female colleague you can just see them nasty teenagers go up to the walls and just piss against the wall (toilets are just around the corner mind you).\nwhile we're standing there, wearing shirts with on them in huge fucking font \"Safety Crew I ♥ Techno\".\n\nSo i go up to the first guy and tell em he cant do that here and toilets are just around the corner, fucking asshat brushes me off &amp; just continues, as do a few others.\nNow at other events i've been instructed by my team leader to just kick em in the ass so they piss them selves so they wont do it again.\n\nbut i'm just too decent for that, and besides i'm off my shift.\nNot only that but i realised something, they clearly dont...\nthe air circulation system, yeah that moisture dripping on you from the circulation system .... that's your own piss and sweat you're dancing in.\n\nI head over to colleagues in another hallway connecting 2 buildings.\nso we start talking about what we've witnessed that night allready...\n\nbut while we're talking this spanish/italian chick walks up to us (again 2 males wearing shirts with in huge letters \"Safety Crew I ♥ Techno\" with 3 female colleagues within a few meters wearing the same)\nand asks where she can buy drugs, even clarifying she's looking for mdma/xtc.\n\nso after we pick up our jaws, and checked that there's none of our superiors around, i shrugg and tell her to try the chillout room (hey they have a drug prevention booth there :p).\n\ni'm still baffled by this ... you dont ask a safety/security/any type of crew for drugs, and she was asking it completely straight faced, like she expected there to be an actual booth labeled DRUGS ...\n\n*sigh*\n\ntl;dr : people dancing in eachother's piss &amp; sweat, girl asks safety crew for drugs, ...",

        "text": "Working my contract job, I had one night a week where I drove to 3 separate accounts and stayed for several hours.\n\nOne was in Dallas near the intersection of Harry Hines and Northwest Highway. For those who don't know, this is a high crime area with prostitutes, drugs, and strip clubs. I was to \"guard\" an unoccupied apartment complex (where Dallas SWAT sometimes trained) that had a 12 foot fence all around it.\n\nI would check the fence when I first came in, but I did not go inside as I was instructed and check the abandoned buildings. Too dangerous in my opinion. No need to walk through abandoned apartments.\n\nSo, I'd often hang out in the 7-11 parking lot next door. The night clerk liked having my marked patrol vehicle in the parking lot, so he'd give me free coffee and sodas. A nice setup.\n\nBut, I could see what appeared to be street level drug dealing from my car. They didn't care about me, and I didn't care about them.\n\nSo, a drunk comes up to my car one night. He's staggering every which way, and he's yelling he's going to get him a job as a security guard.\n\nHe's cussing and hissing, comes up to the window and is loudly asking for an application, all sorts of nonsense as only a drunk can do.\n\nThen, suddenly he leans in close, his voice gets sober, and his face straightens out. \"I'm undercover Dallas Police. There's going to be a drug bust here in ten minutes. Get the hell out of here.\"\n\nHe leaves cussing in his drunken voice that I won't give him a job, cussing the world in general, and so on.\n\nI consider my options, and I decided it was a really good time to go check the gates on the other side of the complex.\n\nSure enough, I could hear it from the other side of the complex, and when I returned to my normal parking spot, there were a dozen police cars and they had the street level dealers all rounded up.",

It was a shell, but was being used to store all the furniture for the third building that was about to be finished.  \n\nEasy post.  Do anything I wanted.  No traffic.  Do round to check the doors once an hour.  I was in college, so it was ideal.\n\nBut, since I did so little work, I did check the fire extinguishers on my rounds to make sure they hadn't been discharged.  \n\nOne day I get moved to the first building since the sergeant was out sick.  Real employees there, but when I did my rounds, I checked the fire extinguishers.  I found about half of them were discharged and required refilling.  Reported same, and picked them up and stored them in the office.\n\nWhen the sergeant got back, we had an all hands meeting that was attended by the corporate security liaison.  He was going off on how he knew the fire extinguishers were empty, but he left them that way to check if any other guards were checking them.  \n\nWhen he said that, the corporate security liaison asked, \"You mean you were leaving our property unprotected to test your own guards?\"\n\nThat was the end of the sergeant.  His cover up got him in more trouble than his poor performance.",

As I give chase, he drops it, and I return it to the dorm.\n\nWhen I write up the incident, I include the numerous maintenance work orders I've written up to get the doors to lock. I get yelled at, and am told to re-write my report, to remove that part. My bosses boss is not just director of security, but director of maintenance, too.",

        "text": "I work corporate/campus security - I am the guy in charge, actually. Now we are contract security so I still answer to the in-house security guys (who treat us very VERY well). Now because we are contractors, our equipment is supplied by our company and not the client, so we have very basic stuff. The client, on the other hand, have incredibly expensive radios and ear buds, exactly the kind of ear-buds the police use. The mic attaches to the collar or sleeve of your uniform. So I approached the in-house guy over us and told him my plan.\n\nThe plan was that the next big conference that is hosted here, I wanted to wear a plain suit blazer over my uniform, wear sunglasses, and borrow their radio and ear-bud. I wanted to dress up as the secret service. Now some background on the in-house guys: these guys don't like to play around. All former police and military background, all over 40, all are armed heavily and take their job very seriously (mostly because we've had an active shooter here before). The in-house guy takes one look at me after telling him my plan/asking if I can do it and says - hell yeah.\n\nSo the next conference, I do exactly that. I dress in my suit jacket (which ended up with us all getting security suit jackets), threw on a pair of sunglasses, borrowed the radio and set up the ear-piece and mic to look official. Let me tell you, never before have so many people treated me different.\n\nAs a uniformed security guard, people tend to treat you like you are beneath them. Doesn't matter if you do have power over them (which in general we have a lot of power) - they are rude to you or ignore you or actively break the rules in front of you. But dressed up like I was secret service, this was different.\n\nAs people arrived, I got a lot of looks. As soon as I turned and looked at the people looking at me, they immediately look away. NO ONE tried to break the rules. When I gave directions to clear an area that was getting crowded, people listened. I walked outside and there are stop signs on the property that people ALWAYS run. Not this time - someone was speeding towards one of the signs and the driver saw me, slammed on their brakes, stopped at the sign - waited several seconds, then very cautiously continued on at slower than the posted speed.\n\nSeveral normal speeders actually slowed to the posted speed or slower. Some people asked if I was secret service - I answered that I was not but I was 'private' security - but most just assumed I was. It was awesome. I have a picture of it somewhere.\n\nAlso, I was able to get away with not having to smile or anything. I would stand and look around with my hands to my front with a straight face.\n\nIn-house guys were so impressed that they requested we all get suit jackets - unfortunately they had to have a patch on the front.
