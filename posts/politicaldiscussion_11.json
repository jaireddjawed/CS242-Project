        "text": " The debate in Washington and other Western capitals over the future of the Russia-Ukraine war privileges the issue of territorial control.\n\nRAND's analysis suggests territorial debate is too narrowly focused on one dimension of the war’s trajectory. Territorial control, although immensely important to Ukraine, is not the most important dimension of the war’s future for the United States.\n\nRAND concludes that, in addition to averting possible escalation to a Russia-NATO war or Russian nuclear use, avoiding a long war is also a higher priority for the United States than facilitating significantly more Ukrainian territorial control.\n\nFurthermore, RAND acknowledges that the U.S. ability to micromanage where the line is ultimately drawn is highly constrained since the U.S. military is not directly involved in the fighting. Enabling Ukraine’s territorial control is also far from the only instrument available to the United States to affect the trajectory of the war. RAND highlighted several other tools—potentially more potent ones—that Washington can use to steer the war toward a trajectory that better promotes U.S. interests. Whereas the United States cannot determine the territorial outcome of the war directly, it will have direct control over these policies.\n\nThe alternative, RAND asserts, is a long war that poses major challenges for the United States, Ukraine, and the rest of the world.\n\nUnder what conditions, if any, can Ukraine find such a negotiated solution palatable?\n\nThe 30-page Rand analysis: Avoiding a Long War is available in Pdf link below and can be downloaded for free:\n\n[Avoiding a Long War: U.S. Policy and the Trajectory of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict | RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PEA2510-1.html)",
