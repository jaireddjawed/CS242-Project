Working there has got to be one of the worst jobs that I have ever worked at, and the most unprofessional managers that I have ever worked for. The coworkers that I\u2019ve worked with are not a problem what so ever. Anyways my first \u201ctraining\u201d was literally just a text from the owner asking if I can come in for training, and when I showed up, the other workers didn\u2019t even know that I was coming in for training. ZERO COMMUNICATION between the owners and the workers what so ever. After my \u201ctraining\u201d, I was on call for literally 2 weeks until the owner finally took the time to include me into the schedule. Speaking of schedule, it\u2019ll take a month until the owner makes a new one, and if you wanted a job so that you can pay for rent like me, then stay AWAY FOR UPC, because you\u2019re only scheduled TWO DAYS A WEEK!! I\u2019ve asked for more shifts and more hours and told one of the owners that I\u2019m here to pay for my rent, and got nothing in return! After working there for almost 3 months, I\u2019ve concluded that the owners are basically money hungry, because why else would they not hire people, give people more shifts, and have assistant managers? Speaking of that, there are none! If you\u2019re the longest to have been working there, then you\u2019re technically \u201cin charge\u201d! Because they don\u2019t wanna pay you more to be an actual manager! To conclude all of this, I was fired literally FOUR HOURS before my shift today and was not given a reason why \ud83d\ude01!
