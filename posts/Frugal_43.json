It costs less than that for me to feed my 80lb dog, so the cat food industry seems like quite a racket. Any cat lovers here have recommendations?\n\nI want something that’s 100% animal protein + nutrient additives, and no grain or starch fillers. I could be convinced to grind my own cat food from poultry/organ meat, but at first glance it doesn’t seem any cheaper, or worth the effort. Thanks in advance.",

We are on and off of the chairs 24/7, many of our staff are 200+ pounds, and the chairs get a lot of abuse with people plopping down hard onto them all day. This isn't a situation where people are sitting calmly in the chairs for several hours not moving around much - these chairs get put through the wringer.\n\nOur manager wants me to find replacements, but she wants to limit the price to $100 per chair. From what I've been reading online, $100 chairs can't stand such heavy usage and will probably start to break down with a year or so (which has been the case with our current chairs - their wheels are breaking off and their \"upright lock\" has been bent out of shape, so they no longer stay upright).\n\nMy question: What would be the approximate lowest price for sturdy, long-lasting (5+ years) office chairs that can take a ton of abuse?",

Then I can avoid paying for an evening fare by riding my ebike 18kms home. It's a lot of effort to save $160 a month, but it rolls my exercise time in with my commute time and forces me to be a lot more active. I need to lose weight, and medative exercise is a free treatment for my ADHD (a lot better than sitting on a train having screen time). Plus it's good starting work earlier and leaving earlier. \n\nMy parents say it's unsustainable, but I figure I'll get fitter, faster, and it will become habit --  and therefore take less mental/physical energy. At the moment it is fairly daunting though and leaves me pretty exhuasted. \n\nI'm curious if others would go to this effort to save almost $2k a year, or if people think it's worth paying that price for public transport.",

I want to be smarter about saving without making knee jerk huge lifestyle changes that affect me and my family (i.e eating ramen and cheap groceries all week, biking instead of driving, etc.).\n\n So im curious , what are your favorite small/first timer lifehacks for saving money? Im talking about the ones like rolling the toothpaste from the bottom of the tube, cutting your windex with water, etc. What are your favorite small money saving hacks?",

        "text": "Yes yES YES I finally have something to post here. I have discovered a Very Important Thing, didn't think it would work out but it's hearty and filling and delicious and everything you could possibly want. \n\n* 1/2kg brown lentil (22.5EGP)\n* 2 large potatoes (I regret not using more potato, consider 3-4 large potatos. What kind doesn't matter I can barely identify it as a potato.) \n* 5-6 medium-sized tomatoes/4 large ones \n* 1 red onion\n* I won't tell you how much garlic. Your spirit knows how much garlic. I should have put more garlic. \n* 3 medium sized carrots. You can totally put more carrots. Overthrow the government. (All the vegetables in addition to the ones I am using in another recipe and cucumbers that I'm not cooking because I'm not insane cost 21EGP)\n* I do not know what things cost on your planet, but I hear Farmers Market and places where you buy shit in bulk is cheap.\n\nSoak your lentils until they drink their fill in water. Throw them in a pot. Add salt. Cook them until when you taste them, you're in heaven. Don't overcook them until they're mushy!\n\nChop the onion and tomatoes. Whatever size you want I don't judge. This recipe makes no sense it won't judge either. \n\nGrate the potatoes and carrots and mix them together. Yes I said mix them together. \n\nGrab your chopped onion. Throw it in a pot. (Make sure the lentils are not sleeping in this pot.) Put oil. Stir them for seven seconds. Now, if you stir them less or more than this, I *will* find you. Now throw in the potato-carrot madness and stir. Stir them until everything is cooked. When you realise this was a mistake and everything is sticking to the bottom and you can't stir a ton of grated potato and carrot in a pot the size of a teenage cat, pour enough water to kinda cover the foodness in there and stir. Add salt because I did and I don't know what happens if you don't. Cover the pot and stand around until you run out of patience. Cook this until the potatoes are cooked, but haven'te gone mushy and still hold their shape. Add garlic and stir. Wait for the garlic to understand what happened. Add the tomato. Stir and let it cook until it's cooked. Season it with seasonings. Realise you put too little salt and redeem yourself.\n\nNow add this to your lentils and mix them together. Yes I said mix them together. \n\nSeason it with seasonings some more until your heart is happy. Ask yourself why this tastes so good. If you live alone this will last you two weeks. If you have a family, hide a bunch of it and don't let them know or it won't last two hours. If you want to be cool, plop this weird deliciousness in a bowl and top with a sqeeze of lemon juice, and cilantro/parsley/dill/some fucking leaves. Maybe drizzle some olive oil if you're extra virgin. \n\nAll in all, this Thing That I Made cost me 38EGP and will last at least two weeks. At least. \n\nIf anyone's curious, I seasoned mine with garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, curry, and ginger.\n\n^(I feel that I have Invented and done a brave thing. If you find that somebody else somewhere has done this before, don't tell me. Please, let me be happy.)",

Recently, PriceBlink turned into CNET Shopping which I didn't think would change anything, but it actually ended up making the extension way worse. It claims to have dozens of coupons available when checking out, but it takes a solid 5 minutes to apply them all and none of them even work on top of that. \n\nI uninstalled CNET shortly afterwards, but then I realized that Honey had hardly done much either over the past several years. I can probably count the number of coupons that have actually worked on one hand, and the price comparison tool often pulls the wrong SKU which leads to misleading matches against products that are similar but not actually the one I'm looking for.\n\nI'll probably end up uninstalling Honey as well, but trying to find a replacement has been much harder than I thought it would be due to there being a ton of overlap between competing coupon/comparison browser extensions. It doesn't seem like there is one \"best\" extension, so I'm open to using a couple of them in tandem as long as I have all of my bases covered.\n\nCurrently, the two I'm considering are Capital One (for the coupons) and Rakuten (for the cash back). I'm also considering adding Keepa purely for tracking Amazon price history, which is something I'd normally use 3camel for except they apparently had some privacy concerns arise recently?",

My wife and I eat out nearly every meal, drive cars that are less than 3 years old and just in general live a lifestyle opposite of frugality.

We are doing fine, but with the combined income we have, I feel like we should be getting further ahead.  I understand the concept and have tried to shift my thoughts and practices, but it never lasts more than a week or two.\n\nHas anyone made the conscious decision to become frugal? How did you go about changes and how did you make them stick? Where did you start? There are definitely areas where we won't change (hobbies, an occasional vacation and what not). In general though, when it comes to eating, daily activities, and general lifestyle, how do you make the shift? \n\nBefore I get hit with not being frugal in the frugal sub, I honestly want to understand how the change can be made and actively pursue it.",

The pocket sized bottle is $2.18/oz.  The family sized pump bottle is $0.60/oz.

        "text": "I’m five months into my frugal journey after years of living by default…always in debt of some sort, never putting any thought into budgeting and saving. \n\nThe thing that is working for me is trying to limit all of my “non essential” spending to what I earn in a part time job. My set monthly expenses are paid by my full time job. \n\nI used to throw all impulse buys on a credit card, which was a horrible, horrible idea. Now, if I don’t have the cash from my side job in my pocket, I don’t spend the money. \n\nI was doing a great job dividing that cash into envelopes for various things, such as a vacation, spending, and unexpected car repairs. Well, the washer broke the other day, and the entire $800 I had saved went to buying a new one. The downside is that all my disposable income is gone. The upside is that I paid for the washer in cash. I actually can’t recall the last time I had $800 cash to buy something. It felt good. \n\nI have my eye on a new pair of pants I want to buy. I also want to go see the new Avatar movie. It’s hard to hold back on those expenditures, but I’m going to wait until I have the cash again.",

        "text": "I have been through lots of discussions with several agents discussing the  best way sell my property and buy a new one. I originally started with a hard requirement that I want to put in an offer THEN list my property. After interviewing several agents, I have been convinced the strategy I want to do is sell my place now, and concurrently look for a place regardless if I find one or not. Basically I am going to potentially sell my place with a lease back, but I don't want to deter potential buyers so I need a back up plan. I can move my stuff into storage if I can't lease back and find a short term rental. I am paying about 60 bucks a day for my current place, and I am wondering (in los angeles or surrounding areas) what is the cheapest way to get a place with wifi and allows 2 teacup dogs?\n\nI know the dogs will be a huge fee, but there is no way around it, so I actually don't even see a pet filter on airbnb but I was thinking airbnb will be a good choice. Any suggestions? honestly I am trying not to spend more than 100 per day but I am learning right now so not sure what to expect. I am prepared to spend over 100 obviously because of the dogs but just looking for the cheapest realistic way of doing short term rentals(monthly).",

        "text": "Hi guys, I'm hoping to get a little perspective on our car dilemma.  \nCurrent car is a '09 Mitsubishi Colt hatchback and family is 2 parents, 2 kids - 1.5y and 4 y. It's a bit squishy but we're not big people and we've made it work so far. The car has been highly reliable with no issues. However we are entertaining the idea of a replacement car that will give us more room and comfort so we can do family (driving) holidays - though driving holidays will be once a year.\n\nOur main form of transport is bike 6-7 days a week to and from work/daycare/lite shopping.   \nThe car is used mainly for larger bulky item shops with a usual max radius of 30km and rare tips to a bigger city which is 160km round trip. The car is stored ungaraged in Australia and is totally smashed by the elements. Hence we have \"held off\" from buying a new car because:\n\n1. use case for car is 1-2 days a week on short trips and \n2. storage conditions are fully exposed to elements.\n\nFor our requirements of size, comfort and better safety we were thinking a car within the sub $35k AUD price range: either a second hand Lexus 2015 IS 300h (40,000 km ODO) or a demo/near new Toyota Corolla 2021/22 Sedan hybrid.\n\nI know the tech in the Lexus is sorely dated for the year but I was investigating after market andriod screen upgrade which would give us Carplay which what we'd use most. Meanwhile the Corolla has this standard but the ride comfort over all may be less than the Lexus. And which would be more reliable over time? \n\nWe loathe the idea of buying a new car only to use it occasionally and have it depreciate exposed the elements so an already depreciated luxury car appears OK as an option.\n\nWould love to know everyone's thoughts on this dilemma.",

I’m 100% remote for work and the car is only used for camping or road trips beyond where our Nissan Leaf (electric car with 150 mi range; air cooled battery doesn’t like long drives in Phoenix summer heat) can go on a charge. I’m optimistic that we’re past the expensive repairs, but there’s no way to know. \n\nMy wife and I live in Phoenix where most things require a car. I’ve considered a new vehicle but it seems like everything is $25k+. \n\nWe could afford a payment but worked for years pre-2020 to go debt-free for everything but the mortgage. Looking to avoid “lifestyle creep”.\n\nI have a few thoughts on options. I could keep biting the bullet on repairs, trade it in on something new with a payment, or sell it/save money/rent a car for weekends where we need the ability beyond the Leaf. I also have an ebike and live in an area with bike lanes and some bus service. \n\nWhat would folks on this sub do?",
