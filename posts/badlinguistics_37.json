It reduces surprise at insignificant diversity in peculiarity of expression so that the listener or reader can focus on the message.

It's unfortunate that because of environment some people haven't been exposed to that pattern.

Who the fuck came up with these words ?\n\nWhich of course means we get the \"English is fucked up!\" gravy train rolling.\n\n&gt;&gt;[English is the whore of languages: we take all comers.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2osvph/with_around_1_million_english_words_every_person/cmq9v68)\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;[The English language is more like an asshole who drags you into an alley beats the shit out of you, steals all the shit out of your pockets and then spits on you as it it leaves.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2osvph/with_around_1_million_english_words_every_person/cmqcsn7) Which is a really bad mangling of James D. Nicoll's quote which he said in a specific context and isn't really applicable here.\n\n*The problem with defending the purity of the English language is that English is about as pure as a cribhouse whore. We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary.*\n\n\nSome more badling about the basis of the English language\n\n[Eh, the basis of the english language is the opposite, actually. First the saxons invaded the anglos, then the romans, then the french.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2osvph/with_around_1_million_english_words_every_person/cmqf3v4)\n\nI learned how languages die\n\n[which honestly might be how a language dies. it gets so bastardized as to become unlearnable/unuseful.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2osvph/with_around_1_million_english_words_every_person/cmqfv4u)\n\nShakespeare apparently came up with most of the unusual words too. \n\nOh yeah, then there's this\n\n&gt;English is a language that is mostly Germanic in origin, but came about by words being left behind by no less than 6 different invading civilizations. That's why it's so much of a pain to learn as a second language.\n\n&gt;Or put another way, 'English is the result of Norman knights attempting to get into the skirts of Saxon barmaids and is no more or less legitimate than any of the other results.'\n\nI'm curious to know what the six invading civilizations were. Romans &amp; Normans for sure. Are they counting the various Viking invasions as separate civilizations? \n\nThis comment is probably the best (and by best I mean worst)\n\n&gt;There are a lot of reasons English is so fucked up. A couple people commented that Shakespeare was the cause. In 1066, English was clearly part of the Germanic language family. Then, the battle of Hastings happened, and most of England came under the rule of the Normans. Who were the Normans in 1066? They were from a part of France that had been conquered by Scandinavian Vikings. They spoke a language very similar to modern French, but with some Scandinavian words mixed in (and probably some other minor differences as well). After the Normans conquered England, for about 300 years their language was the language of nobility, and English was not perceived well. Of course, the lower classes continued to speak English, but they weren't very literate, so the writing of English got really fucked up. There were many differences of opinions on how words should be spelled. Meanwhile, English starts picking up loads and loads of loan words from the upper classes, so that for many things there are often two words that mean the same thing (chicken and poultry are the same thing for example), and one word originates from old English, the other from Norman French. Eventually, the upper classes stopped speaking French, and started speaking English, but by then, the damage was irreparable. No spelling rules were agreed upon for a long time, which didn't help the problem, so spellings got pretty fucked up. When the spelling was standardized, they decided that the spelling of words would indicate the country of origin. Thus we have different rules for Italian words like Pizza, and French words like superficial in French. But if that wasn't fucked up enough, they didn't always exactly follow the spelling of the country the word came from, and always ignored accents over vowels, for whatever reason. The result is a language, that, while technically classified as Germanic, is probably the least Germanic Germanic language due to it's major influences from Norman French.\nTLDR English is pretty fucked up.",
