        "text": "New here. Not sure if this is the right place for this. Please let me know otherwise. \n\nI am 39 years old. I‚Äôll be 40 later this year. Please forgive me if any of what I am saying is unclear. I have been drinking. \n\nTo get to where I am going, I feel the need to tell you quickly where I have been. Quickly. \n\n2004. I was an anti-alcohol person before joining the military, as my parents were heavy drinkers my whole childhood. I served 10 years in active duty and the NG. Had only one deployment (unfortunately). But it was enough apparently. During that deployment I lost friends, and my fiance at the time. She cheatee on me. After my deployment I found liquor and cigarettes. Over the next five years of deployment memories, and after I was laid off from a long time job, I abused alcohol quite heavily. To the point where I was getting the shakes and having crazy panic attacks. This was the first time I would say I was depressed, and an alcoholic. The attacks left me scared enough where I was uncomfortable being alone. I never asked for help. This was around 2012, and at the time, the loweat point of my life. \n\nI later met someone who made me forget about my worries. I ended up marrying her, and we moved to Europe to be closer to her family. I was happy. Being with her made me stop drinking. I stopped smoking. I even started eating healthier, to the point where I decided to go vegan for five years. A complete change. \n\nBut it wasn‚Äôt all smiles. And about half way through things were going sour. Fast-forward to the end of 2020 - I decided to go back to school. During the pandemic. She decided to concentrate more on her ambitions. We started to drift even further apart. \n\nSchool was important to me. I strived to maintain a 4.0. It was more of a pride thing for me. To prove that I had it in me. Was it worth it now? I don‚Äôt know. \n\nSkip to 2022. About 10 months ago now. Which is wierd. She brought up divorce. And I agreed to it. A month later she has a new guy and moves with him. I can‚Äôt help to think that she had cheated on me as I previously found clues in the end, before it ended. She would be the second one to do such a thing, but after seven years of marriage, it broke me. Completely. \n\nAt this time, I had many different hobbies and interests. \n\nToday, I live alone. With the exception of my dog (which WAS our dog). And I‚Äôm miserable.\n\nOver time the thoughts made their way in. And I often can‚Äôt hold back my feelings and tears. I did relapse. It was subtle at first, but now full-blown. I see myself drinking up to 3/4 of a bottle of Jim Beam‚Ä¶ in 6 hours. And now I buy a bottle every couple of days. I am not happy about it, and I see where this is heading. \n\nI received my first ‚ÄòF‚Äô just last quarter, and had no choice to withdraw. That said‚Ä¶ my grades are slipping. \n\nI am not suicidal. I am lost. Depressed. Lonely. And hurt. \n\nI do see a therapist. At first it was every week, and now every two weeks. But now I see myself postponing these appointments due to being ‚Äúsick‚Äù. I don‚Äôt feel much better after sessions. \n\nI just don‚Äôt have the passion anymore‚Ä¶ for anything.\n\nI have lost interest in school (programming and photography), music (piano, singing, and guitar), video games, running (I was previously a very big runner), and working out. And, thanks to my ex, I don‚Äôt have any friends. No on to talk to. \n\nI come home from work. Tend to my dog. And then I drink myself stupid while watching musicals or sad movies. \n\nI need help. I have tried to go a day without alcohol, but boredom/depression/ memories fly by and I fail. I forgot how to enjoy myself without it, or I just don‚Äôt care anymore. But I need help. Which is why I am here. \n\nI need advice. What can I do? \n\nThanks in advance.",

It is killing my self esteem and confidence, and my social interactions.\n\nI've never been consider attractive, well i was consider ugly most of the time. For example, at high school i was bullied by girls for my appearance. They would call me names and hit me. I'm still dealing with the trauma today even if it has fade away. \n\nBut my life take a huge turn when i decided to go to gym. This have been the worst decision of my life. I've had fast progress. I was a little overweight and i lost many of my fat BUT there was still those love handles and i still dont have abs. And it KILLS ME. Its at that time i began to obsess on my appearance. I could literally cried if i saw my fat. I went from eating 1000 calories a day to get rid of that fat but it doesnt worked. I had to wear baggy clothes to hide it, and i began  to cut my skin on my arms and my belly with a razor.\n\nAt summer 2022 i get a job to pay my studies. It was a physical job and i had to eat more to do it. I went back from 2000 calories. Doing a physical job has done wonderful results on me: no love handles anymore and six-pack!\n\nI would expect my dysmorphia to disappear since i'm now fit but guess what? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Instead it moves on my face. I'm hating every aspect on my face now.\n\nI need help. It really kills my confidence and my social life. Sometimes i isolate from everyone because i dont want them to see me. I have also 0 romantic interactions because i do not want to show my body and i feel i don't deserve love because of my flaws. Do you have clues to help me find out how to get rid of this?\n\nHere's what i do right now to fight it:\n\n\\-I have a list of positive affirmations (like 'people can still like me if i'm ugly') that i tell myself when i heard the self hating voices in my head. Unfortunately, the voices are often stronger than the affirmations.\n\n\\-I posted a pic on reddit and get a lot of compliments. I watch these compliments weekly to make me feel better.\n\n\\-i go to therapy. I just had only one appointment and it wasnt really helpful as i basically cry the entire session telling him that im ugly and worthless. I will see the next sessions\n\n\\-stop the self harm. Sometimes i have urges but i manage to control it. I've been free of self harm for 42 days",

For a long time it messed me up until I realized I don't know myself. So I decided to take a self discovery journey and accepting my flaws, unlearning things, and being more self aware. It has been uncomfortable and I don't know what to do at times. \n\nToday I had a difficult talk and it's left me overwhelmed. I feel  guilty and sad among other things. I don't even know how to describe my feelings and it's making me more sad. I know it's a process but days like this make me feel like reverting to my old ways and ignoring the problem but I am choosing to feel it and acknowledge it. I'm hoping it's worth it. \n\nI suffer from lack of self worth due to years of getting comfortable with the feeling. It's safer to think they don't want me than trying since I have a fear of rejection. I have been people pleasing and seeking approval. However, I'm happy to say, I have recognized my pattern and step by step, I'm making progress. I don't seek external validation anymore. I am caring less everyday what people think of me.",

When I was little I was unpopular and invisible, and this might have an effect, but I wanted to be extroverted around them to seem cool. This guy in particular I considered a good friend and tried to get him on self improvement and I discouraged video games and TikTok.  After a while it all turned around and he is mad when I try to tell him something which I changed in myself, when I saw he was bluntly scrolling through social media I'd say to him to stop, since I felt that would've helped me, but he would just be mad at me and make fun of me. After that I stopped trying to help him and didn't really care but he continued to make fun of me and he would make fun of things I said to him in private as a friend. He started being a very toxic person always trying to make me angry. It happened a few times where he was pushing me to the edge to beat him up, since I'm bigger then him. I figured I will stop responding to his existence all together since he has nothing good to say.\n\nNow, after a few days everyone is turning down on me. A good friend that came to class later in the year, I was first to comfort and no one liked him except me, now he tells me that I'm always wrong. First he said to me that I get angry very easily, I thought about it and figured I'm little too hyperactive and I do get raged up quickly (I'm not angry like I hate you, more of like I shout and similar), so today I tried to be calmer and I said to myself I won't swear anymore. Now that I've done that and try to be calm they are the ones who are doing those same things. And today I said to my other friend that I don't want him to do those things anymore and when he didn't listen I became a little rough and now he's angry at me. If I put myself in his shoes I wouldn't be as angry, it almost feels like when  your girlfriend is mad at you for no reason.\n\nDo I have low quality friends or should I search myself. How do I cope with being alone in the class, even being alone doesnt bother me much but these people come up to me and want me to speak to them but when I actually do they don't like it. I feel like I'm surrounded by snakes. \n\nAm I the problem or should I just let it go? It's destroying my mental health.",

        "text": "I just recently turned 27. The last day as 26, I had a random spiral feeling like shit for about 2 hours and then instantly went back to normal and calm. Within two days of being 27, I'm having mood swings and feels like I'm lost in my life. I'm getting a new position at my workplace and will go into training soon, but am somehow not feeling excited about it nor do I feel like I'm ready for these new changes that are coming so quickly at work. I'm only 3 years away from 30. No boyfriend, live with my parents, I work a part time and take a chinese class and have dance practices for performances, and potential private teacher for dance lessons. I thought I would be satisfied with this but maybe things are just moving too quick and apparently I'm not too satisfied. \nI have almost everything in the world already, great friends, a community I belong to, good family relationships, but I feel something is missing. It's almost as if I've already experienced everything there is to experience.  I'm looking forward to the private lessons to teach others but I don't know, I feel like I'm just ready to retire. I don't see what else I need to achieve in life. It's like I'm just a wave in the sea that just goes with the flow and not provide any decision on where I want to be in life an empty wave that passes by with no surfer. An afterthought. I've also heard of the 27 club and I am hoping to try to outlive it to my 28th",

Some days very energetic and others suddenly sad. Kind of felt like it was a jackpot and, some days I'd just hit it: \"today I feel good!! it's one of those days.\"\n\nSince I balanced my diet, alongside with some supplements (omega 3, multi-vitamins, magnesium, vitamin 3) and drinking LOTS of water... I feel like my best self every day! I may feel tired because of a bad night sleep, I might have a stressful day at work... but I can't explain it, I always feel like myself now no matter what happens. Way more present, less mental fog, more energy.\n\nIt has only been one month yet but the only thing that I've changed in my lifestyle is diet so I'm attributing it to that. The change in my diet was radical... WAAAY more veggies, way more protein, way more water... less unhealthy fats, etc. \n\nI'd encourage anyone to invest on their diet and cook their own meals. I'll keep going and see how I feel... just wanted to share, maybe someone needed to hear this.",

I ignore my frustrations and how I'm not really ok with a certain thing and I continue acting calm and collected. Until finally, I cant control myself or tolerate the thing/ person that has been bothering me anymore and I explode (by explode I mean that i become  rude and verbally aggressive) and then because of my behavior, I get called overdramatic and am labelled as the bad guy even if my issues were valid. I've actually lost friends because of this problem of mine, and just today it happened again. I got overdramatic and got laughed at because I was tired of people telling me half sentences instead of the truth. Granted I know I could have approached the situation better but man I was so angry. Im tired of repeating this same mistake over and over and just losing friends. I am genuinely so tired of this and I'm so tired of keeping everything to myself until I explode then get called as dramatic. Its such anembarassing behavior and im just done with myself for constantly doing this and losing friends. Does anyone have any tips on how to fix this? Im leaving the country in a few months for university. Its  going to be my new start wth new people who don't know anything about me. I really want to improve myself until then so that in university I don't make this mistake again. If anyone has any tips pls tell me I rlly want to change. Also does anyone know how to be confident and not let people walk all over me without being closed off or rude? I really struggle between being somewhat of a doormat or just being closed off. If anyone has any tips on these two issues can you please share.  I know this is rambly but the fight I had today really bothered me and I want to change. Also how do I stop ignoring red flags in people? Like i see something I dont like but I just keep ignoring it until again I explode. In general i feel like i should learn how to read people better and be more aware of those around me. If anyone has any ideas pls help me out and thank you &lt;3",

        "text": "Something I've noticed as I've worked on myself is that the more proud of myself and content I become with my own company, the higher my standards for my social circle &amp; potential partners becomes.\n\n\nI used to think I constantly needed to be talking to someone to have friends, and to constantly be available for sexual stuff online to be appealing to anyone. I thought I needed a romantic partner to complete myself.\n\nNow I'm in a state where I'm happy with myself. I enjoy seeing the way my body changes when I nourish and look after it. I enjoy being in my own company. I have stronger friendships now and I don't feel the need to constantly be in contact with them - we can go days, even weeks without directly talking and I don't feel any anxiety or self loathing for that. \nYet the main thing I've noticed is that my standards and expectations have gone up, too.\n\n\nBack then, I was talking to people who leant heavily on each other for encouragement and validation - and if the group didn't agree on something, the individual agreed with the group. I was unconfident making my own decisions and I wasn't comfortable taking action by myself \"just in case\" it went wrong.\nNow, I'm talking to people who are very supportive of each other &amp; help grow each others ideas - and if anyone within the group disagrees with anybody else within the group, they say it just isn't their thing but that doesn't mean the individual shouldn't go ahead anyway. I am much more confident making my own decisions, I'm better at forward planning to figure out what to expect with those decisions and when taking action - even if it's only small actions a lot of the time.\n\nBack then, my standards for a potential romantic partner were:\n- average or slightly above\n- healthy\n- someone happy to fill the silences\n- someone to take a nurturing, paternal role in the relationship\n- someone who my parents will approve of\n\nNow, my standards for a potential romantic partner are:\n- attractive, but in a unique way which makes them interesting to look at, rather than generic attractive \n- healthy &amp; with an interest in staying healthy\n- competent in professional settings\n- someone who understands the importance of gratitude in their personal and professional life\n- someone to treat me as an equal\n- someone with their own life\n- someone with a good foothold in their career &amp; with longterm career goals &amp; a plan to reach them\n- someone content with silences \n- someone who enjoys cooking as much as I do\n- someone who knows we're not going to be completing each other, but complimenting and coexisting with each other &amp; growing together instead\n- someone who doesn't subscribe or cave to toxic masculinity and who isn't afraid of their own emotions &amp; who won't expect me to bottle mine up either \n- someone who is invested in themselves as much as I'm invested in myself\n- someone who will be in a relationship with me because they want to, not because they think they need to be\n\nAnd I think that difference is just really neat.\nI enjoy my life, and I'm content with myself right now. I have an interesting career (I'm an artist and author), I'm learning how to animate, I'm working on finding a hobby I enjoy that *isn't* career related (I read, I write, I draw, I design... and all of it circles into each other üòÖ but I wanna get back into nature photography and music), I'm taking small but consistent steps to overcoming my agoraphobia, anxiety &amp; paranoia each day, I'm in recovery from eating disorders, and I love looking after my animals.\nAm I where I thought I would be at 23? No.\nBut younger me didn't factor in the amount of time healing, growing &amp; transitioning would take. Younger me thought I'd be married and bored by now, too, or constantly hooking up for validation, so I'm happy I'm in a different stage of life than I expected to be at 23.\n\nNot entirely sure where I was taking this post, but yeah - I enjoy improving myself because it encourages me to improve my life, and in doing so, improves my outlook of my future and my view of myself.",

I have lately been able to manage my depression more but I am having a very hard time with my anger and outbursts.\n\nI always feel unheard or like everything is against me. I know a portion is of how I was raised but I'm losing my s/o to this because I have very harsh and loud outbursts and continue to say things when unnecessary. \n\nI know what I am doing is wrong but something in me wont stop right away. I don't want to lose my partner and I want to get my emotions under control. I did just finish part of my cycle so my hormones are leveling out.\n\nI do not know what to do at this point. I keep looking up ways to change and it all gives me the same. I will do those things and then one thing happens and I kind of snap. I do not know why I let certain things get to me so bad. I also can not afford therapy currently. \n\nI feel hopeless and when I get upset over something or have a problem my partner wont listen to me because she thinks I will go off which will make me mad because I wasn't mad in the first place but her thinking I was automatically angry made me angry, It shouldn't but I end up feeling so unheard and treatment stays the same. It ends up in the same cycle after a while and I am so tired of reverting back to being so toxic. I do not want to lose my partner over my own problem.\n\nHow do I control my outbursts? How do I turn it around and end up not angry over little things? She can say something about nothing and I'll interpret it in the worst way possible. I just want to be able to  talk and communicate like a normal person. At least one with a healthy relationship. \n\nAny advice would be incredibly beneficial and even a harsh wake-up call is probably needed.\n\nThank you for helping me",

When we lack external stimulation, we may overthink and ruminate, which can be detrimental to our mental well-being.\n\nTherefore, it's important to strike a balance between self-reflection and engaging in real-world activities. Spending too much time in solitude can cause us to ruminate excessively, whereas too much external stimulation can leave little room for introspection.\n\nBy finding the ideal level of self-reflection that works for us, we can prevent the negative effects of excessive rumination and self-hate while also fostering a healthy sense of self-awareness.",

I'm not going to say I'm not the problem or I am, but I just can't see anything actually wrong with me to not have a social life. \n\nI hate being average looking and wish I was pretty, with a good looking boyfriend to compliment. It sounds shallow, but I feel suicidal everytime I see a photo of myself. It doesn't help I look really young for my age. I have no confidence. I also have social anxiety and diagnosed anxiety.

        "text": "I recently had a personal breakthrough in confidence, and I just kinda wanna go through and describe how I got here, both for myself and others. \n\nBut first, let me tell you a little bit about myself before I gained this newfound confidence. Not too long ago, I was a fat, ugly, miserable little piece of shit who didn‚Äôt deserve love or happiness, someone you could barely call human. That was what I would tell myself every day. And I mean. Every. Day. When I wasn‚Äôt telling myself that I would eat away the pain or watch porn. I didn‚Äôt realize it then, but that was pretty much my insecurities ruling how I lived my life. My brain accepted my own insecurities as facts, and refused to accept any of my better aspects.\n\nI was stuck in this infinite loop of self loathing. Then some things happened in my life, things I‚Äôd rather not talk about. But when I was there, at one of then lowest points of my life, I discovered that it‚Äôs okay to look up. You don‚Äôt have to constantly keep your head down in shame of who you are. Your flaws are a part of you, but they don‚Äôt define you. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt recommend hitting rock bottom before coming to this conclusion, but ultimately it‚Äôs your choice.\n\nConfidence isn‚Äôt something you obtain from outside sources, but something you create within yourself. In the end, it really is just a mind game. You have to make yourself believe you‚Äôre the shit, because the truth is you are. And the sooner you accept that, the sooner your life will start to turn around. \n\nNow when I describe myself, I think of myself as a kind, genuine, thoughtful, hilarious, strong, resilient, capable, honest, hilarious, accepting, brave, and did I mention hilarious yet?\n\nEither way you get the point. The sooner you start telling your self you can, then the sooner you will.\n\nNot sure if I really explained my breakthrough properly, but I hope it helped atleast a little. And if I didn‚Äôt, I hope this was atleast an entertaining read.",

I've grown pretty tight with him over the course of the year, so much so that he offered for me to stay at his place. I don't really have many friends, nonetheless friends who would be willing to let me live with them, so I happily accepted. Even though we're friends, he's always struck me as a bit of a hedonist; he rarely showers, gets bad grades, and generally doesn't take care of himself. This never used to bother me until I started living with him. I told him about how I had a 120 day streak going on nofap, so he started showing me fucking hentai to try 'entice' me. First of all, what the fuck? We may both like anime, but that doesn't mean that I'm also into that sort of stuff. Secondly, what kind of friend knowingly tries to make their friend give into one of their vices? This was just one of many ways that he tried to stop me from bettering myself. Right now I have to study all of Algebra 2 to make it into precalculus next year, and the algebra 2 placement test is scheduled for just after this break. Basically I have to study a shit ton over this break to make it into precalculus, but he's made it really difficult for me. Whenever I'm trying to study, he constantly asks when I'll be done, so that we can play Apex Legends or some other shit. I genuinely don't understand how someone could view playing video games as equally important to their academic career, yet he somehow does. He's also one of those people who thinks that being racism = funny. We may both be black, but I still hate the fact that he calls me the n word with a hard r on a regular basis. That's also not mentioning all the things he says about other races. I'm still grateful that he let me stay with him, but part of me regrets our friendship as a whole. He's really fun to hang out with, but I think that the quote about picking your friends wisely may be correct.",

        "text": "I've not been motivated in a very long time. This is likely all due to depression but I haven't cared about really much of anything in a long time. I'd like to start trying to better myself because I will probably be going back to college in the fall and I don't want to fail like last time. How can I become motivated to care about my health and hygiene again? How can I get motivated to actually exercise and how can I make it enjoyable instead of boring and painful? How can get myself to keep trying to be social even when when im repeatedly rejected? I want to change but I can't actually get myself to make an effort.",

        "text": "Hi guys! So I‚Äôm a university sophomore and there is a girl I recently starting talking too in my program and I really like her. It‚Äôs to the point however that I‚Äôm constantly refreshing my Snapchat to see if she snaps back, analyzing her tone in texts etc etc. I catch myself laughing because Id never thought I‚Äôd stoop to this level. I can‚Äôt concentrate on my school work cause all I‚Äôm doing is focusing on the girl and I‚Äôm I don‚Äôt even 100% know if she has feelings for me so for all I know this could be a one sided situation but there has been subtle hints dropped. \n\nI have a lot of goals in terms of self improvement. I want to be in the gym consistently, get top grades, and overall just work on my SHITTY mental health but I feel like I‚Äôve just been pushing everything off staying up late to talk with this girl then missing the gym in the morning, saying things just to impress her etc. \n\nHow do I get this girl off my mind, or atleast not feel obligated to be checking my phone 24/7 to see her notification? To preface , my ex of 10 months dumped me last summer so it could be I‚Äôm just craving that physical connection &amp; attention ?\n\nAny advice helps!",

Focus on yourself, focus on developing yourself, growing yourself, investing in yourself and finding what makes you unique, because you ***are*** truly unique, and you bring your own value into this world.\n\nSo focus on you, not on others, and step into Joy, confidence, and self worthiness.",

The first time around,  I was a huge mess and did not know what I was doing whatsoever. I was taking far too many credits, working too much at the same time, and just constantly in burn out and didn't understand why. This time around I'm doing a lot better by not taking nearly as much credits and trying to get things done early.... but I still get screwed with classes that have difficult material and take a long ass time (I mean HOURS) for me to complete the assignments/studying to the point where I struggle with balancing other classes. I work full time and my shifts are early mornings so I have to be in bed at a certain hour.  Then I start hitting points of burn out and get really flustered (I'm here right now.) I'm trying NOT to hit burn out to make things easier for myself.\n\nwhat can I do??",

I hate being fat, brown and short and the gym, diet, and focusing on school and finding a job is helping. So is going to therapy, taking meds, supplements, dressing and grooming better. I have even found things I love to do like cooking, trivia, and taking wine sommelier classes.\n\nOKAY NOW BIG QUESTION: It will be a while before I am ripped, filled with confidence, and bringing a girl back to my place to cook dinner for her. In the meantime how the actual heck do I learn to be okay being undateable, single, alone, without being filled with self hatred and sadness?",
