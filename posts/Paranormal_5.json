        "text": " \n\nI should say I did not believe in the paranormal at all at first, but now, anything is possible. Tell me what you think it could be\n\nA few months ago, I saw something I cannot explain. I created a Reddit account just so I could tell this story without being looked at like I'm out of my mind.\n\nIt was a Saturday in October, about noon. I was with some of my friends and colleagues at a theme park called Kings Island. It is a wonderful place, very high quality, actually has been upvoted as America's favorite theme park on more than one occasion.\n\nBut, while me and my friends where having fun, feeling like kids again, something, without us knowing, was watching and listening. I was the first one to feel it, I thought I was insane at first, but, I'm not sure anymore. I just felt very uneasy, and I was getting that \"someone or something is watching me feeling\" a lot.\n\nI also saw something at the corner of my eye 3 times, but whenever I looked, it would vanish. After the third time, I noticed Lizzy, my friend, and Jon, my boyfriend, having similar uneasy expressions.\n\nLooking to the side a lot as well. I whispered in Jon's ear \"Do you keep seeing that too?\" \"Yeah.\" He replied. I then whispered in Lizzy's ear, she said the same.\n\nWe where having fun and didn't want to spoil the fun, so we just decided it must have been a kid hiding behind a tree, waiting to jump out and say \"boo\" to a friend. Still, we couldn't wipe away how uneasy we felt. Now, I read stories on reddit without an account about paranormal or weird crap happening to people...I always see variations of the quote \"chill down my spine\" and have never really experienced that. Something about that \"kid\" felt wrong. I felt that chilling feel over and over again.\n\nWe decided to head over to Orion when I heard something that scared me so much I thought my eyeballs where going to fall out of my skull, and I gagged on my own tongue. \\*SNAP!\\* I swear, something was behind us and stepped on something that broke. We all looked behind us and lying behind us was a light up sword that was snapped in half. Jon tried to reassure me and Lizzy by saying \"This is a popular park, a visitor stepped on it.\" But that was just the problem...This park is normally full of people, in fact, *seconds* ago it was. I *never* cuss but, my god, it was *too fucking* quiet.\n\nThe only sound we heard was the wind, rocking the swings on the swing ride back and forth, making the overused metal squeak. We just kept moving, thinking nothing of it, but my god, who could have broke that toy? Nobody was there! And the path is a straight shot, there was *no way* someone could have broken it without us seeing.\n\nWe got in line for Orion, and although the line for that one is usually long, it was very short this time, Jon, being the bro that he is, kept trying to keep our mind off the whole thing. \"We got lucky with our timing, huh?\" He said. I wanted to get my mind off it too, so I let out a pathetic little giggle.\n\nWe got on the ride, second row from front. The rest of our friends filled 4 other rows. The announcer turned on her microphone and said \"Here you go up and away on Orion. Enjoy your ride and the rest of your day at Kiiiings Island!\" and the ride began. We where at the very top of the hill when Jon violently shook me and pointed at the woods, where we saw trees moving in a path, like something was jumping from tree to tree. It was actually terrifying.\n\nWe went down the hill, and as we where going hundreds of miles per hour, I SWEAR I could make out a small inhuman face looking at us as we rode the coaster. When we got off, we heard something that sounded like a human scream, but it wasn't a human scream. It sounded *almost* human, but...I don't know. It just wasn't right.\n\nAbout 4 hours later, the sun was going down. My friends Amy and Kyle offered to buy us some of the famous Kings Island ice cream. It was an offer we couldn't refuse. And after a few more rides, it was time for the firework show before the closing.\n\nSo you can get an idea where we where, we where just coming off of Diamondback when the rest of our friends wanted to ride Mystic Timbers before it closes, because of the lack of a line. Jon and Izzy felt bad leaving me alone after we got spooked, and we still couldn't wipe that \"something's watching\" vibe.\n\nOnce again, when we where nearby Action Zone, it got too quiet again, and we saw something we will never forget. It was crawling on all fours, It had eyes that glowed blue, it's skin was green, and it had scales all over it's body. It started standing up on it's legs, and it was *huge.*\n\nit was TALL! At least 7'5, and the thing *spoke.* The thing screeched and said something under it's breath, none of us could make out any words other than \"harm,\" \"run,\" and \"feed.\"\n\nIt ran into the woods after that. We didn't get any sleep, and since then, we haven't told anyone about it.\n\nIt was today when I saw a number of people claiming to see a blue-eyed creature all throughout Mason and Cincinatti Ohio that I knew it was time to make a Reddit account, and share the story. If anyone has seen this creature, do tell. Thank you for hearing me out. If you know what this thing is, tell me. Until then, goodbye.",

        "text": "My grandmother (my moms mother) recently passed away about two weeks ago. It was a very hard time for my family and my mother. She was the very last grandparent i had, as my other grandparents passed away years ago. Additionally, in April of 2021, I lost 2 uncles within 5 weeks of each other (both my mothers brothers). One was expected and the other was not. So its been a rough couple of years for my poor mother. Shes slowly healing, but I am sure it still hurts her. She was over at my house last night and was telling me about traveling back home (she had to fly over seas for the funeral) and about how it was nice being with her family and just laughing and crying together. She had made it back home one day before my grandmother passed and got to see her one last time.\n\nMy mom told me some interesting stuff that happened while she was back home with my grandma. The first thing happened after my grandma was hospitalized (she had been taken to the hospital at some point before my mom got there). Mom said while the family was visiting her, my grandmada, who was 97 years old at the time and mostly blind, said she could see her husband (my deceased grandpa) and my 2 uncles that had passed away, all standing in the room waiting for her. My mom and aunts and uncles were asking her what she is talking about, and told her there was no one here. I have heard about people seeing loved ones right before dying so i thought that was really interesting. \n\nNot much after that my grandma passed and they had the funeral for her. Almost the whole town came to my grandmas funeral, as funerals are a big deal back home. My mom of course was devastated but it was expected after all. That night, mom told me she had a dream that she was with a bunch of deceased cousins and family, as well as some living ones. My mom said she looked at her deceased relatives and said ‚Äúwhat are you guys doing here?‚Äù. She said one of her cousins then said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre just waiting for your mom!‚Äù. Mom said at that point one her cousins, who is alive, came up to her and gifted her with two boxes of sweets. He said ‚Äúone is for you and one is for sister. We are sorry for your loss‚Äù. Mom said after that she woke up. \n\nThe next day, my mom said she went to my grandmas house to clean out some things with my aunt. Mom said they had a ton of visitors and people coming by to pay their respects. At one point, my mom said her cousin from the dream came to see her. He had brought two boxes of sweets with him. He gave one to my mom and one to my aunt, and obviously my mom was shocked. She told him about the dream and they all kind of laughed together and discussed it. My mom kept repeating to me how shocked she was at that moment when the same scenario from the dream happened. \n\nI asked my mom, who is 56, about what she thought about grandma seeing the dead relatives and what this all means (the dream included). She said ‚ÄúI really dont know but it has to be something good‚Äù. I told her I agreed.\n\nIn my opinion, there is something very comforting about knowing you could get to see all of your loved ones again when you die, and that they almost ‚Äúwelcome‚Äù you home as you pass away. This tells me there just has to be something better waiting for us after this life. I just know it. Thank you for reading.",

        "text": "Let's start this off my saying, I usually don't believe in many things. I like science, and thus I like explanation. I like things making sense. \nWerewolves, vampires, Bigfoot. Make no such sense. They can't be logical so why believe in fairytale? \n\nI guess this is my own karma for not letting my mind open wider. \n\n\n\nIt was a Saturday, I live in the south so. It's still a bit cold- not uncomfortable. There is a nice breeze but wearing a jacket wouldn't be too bad. (You'll see why I added this later) \n\nI was alone at home, and bored. My boyfriend was out of town and my other friends have work. I work from home and as of that moment, nothing was going on. I decided it would be...motivating I guess, to go for a walk in the trail behind my house, it was a nice day. And the trees were pretty to look at. \n\nNow my boyfriend doesn't like me going out alone- not because he is controlling, no he is a sweetheart. It's because he is worried about me, he always claims that\n\"The woods watch you I swear\" blah blah\nOf course, I didn't believe him because that's completely stupid. \n\nSo I get my shoes on, throw on a thin jacket. And leave. I wanted the fresh air, and the nice quiet the woods gave.\nAnd that I got, it was a calm walk, about an half hour in though I thought I started to hear the crunching of leaves. \n\nI dismissed it as a deer, or fox. They are very common in my area. So I felt no worried or anxious feelings. \n\nA good maybe 10 minutes of walking later, I did see a deer. However, this deer was not what I was expecting.  Right there, jusy right on the trail. Was a dead deer. \n\nI honestly don't even think dead helps describe it enough, the thing was slaughtered. It looked like it's been sliced up the stomach to its neck, it's guts were just spilling out of it.  It's head almost seemed to have been snapped, one of its legs were missing. And blood covered the ground around it. \n\nThe smell hit me harder than the general shock of it. It smelled completely horrid, not even that of well- something dead. It smelled like rotting flesh and even wet dog? If that makes sense. \n\nI said rotting flesh, but the kill looked fresh. I didn't touch it but I wouldn't have been surprised if it was still hot. \n\nI decided that was definitely enough, I walked for about an hour anyway, time to head back. \nI just backed away from the deer and swiftly started to head back. Not wanting whatever killed it to come back to take it away to eat while I was nearby. \n\nEverything seemed calm and nice, until I heard the sound of crunching leaves again. I swear I felt eyes drilling a hole into me, I looked around but nothing. Nothing at all. So why did I hear leaves? It sounded close, as if it was just a few feet away. \n\nThis caused me to speed up more. \n\nNow I could see my house at the end of the trail, sighing in relief I slumped my shoulders and relaxed. \n\nAs I stepped off the trail and into my back yard, thats when I heard it. A low growl\n\nI was on my back porch, I froze. I turned to look back at this noise and there it was\n\nA wolf, ok well thank goodness. Now my damn worries were answered. \n\nWell not really, there aren't wolves were I live. So I was confused. \n\nIt was just, staring at me. It had no threatening stance, no odd posture. It just stared at me with unblinking eyes. \n\nI mean it was as if it was a taxidermy piece. The only thing thay moved even slightly. \n\nWas it's head to follow me, I was backing up to make my way to the back door. \n\nI touched the handle and shook my head. Maybe it was just someone's lost dog. \n\nThats when i saw it. It's breathing, I saw a cloud of breath leave its nose. As if it was in the winter. This brought me into further confusion. \n\nBut thay confusion quickly turned to complete fear as I watched this wolf, this thing I guess\n\nStand up on its back legs, his head not moving as it just stared at me. Un-blinking. I still remember those vivid blue eyes. \n\nI stumbled to open the door and quickly shut it and locked it behind me. I closed the blind because hell no I wasn't gonna let that thing look in at me. \n\nAfter a few moment I brought up the courage to inch my way over and peek out the blinds. \n\n\nIt was gone. What really freaked me out more, was the fact that I didn't see footprints. The trail isn't far off at all from my house. Maybe 5 feet at most. I would have seen them- \n\n\nI stayed in the living room until my boyfriend got home. Let's just say I did get sympathy from my story- \n\nHe believed me, which relaxed my mind. He even said he had some odd experiences himself with the odd wolf. \n\nhowever the one thing he did say was a good \n\n\"I told you so\" \n\nYeah I shouldn't have went alone. I know that now. \n\n\nI don't know what I saw, but I haven't seen it since then, it's been a few weeks now. I still fear it though, those eyes and how motionless it was. It still see it in my dreams. Just those eyes, I have been having more nightmares lately. \n\nWhat I still don't understand is, how did it just stand up like that- it wasn't just like when a dog peeks at something or trying to get a treat from your hand. No, it was as if its legs were just naturally supposed to move like that, as if this thing was just supposed to walk like us. \n\nWhatever this thing was- werewolf or whatever. I hope it stays away.",

        "text": "When I was a pre-teen/early teen I had recurring nightmares involving my maternal grandparents. Their residence would change or be different in many of the dreams, but there would always be this dark room with an evil presence inside of it, usually on an upper floor. I would usually be too frightened to go inside, but the few times I was brave enough to enter there would only be darkness, that malevolent feeling, and sometimes there would be a mirror. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn one particular dream, my family on my mom's side was downstairs, talking and enjoying themselves while I happened to be exploring in the evil room upstairs. I looked into the mirror and I saw the reflection of a girl running past behind me. When I ran downstairs to tell them what I just saw, everyone and everything just became dead silent. They were all just looking at me without saying a word, until my mom came up to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said, \"That girl represents the curse of my past.\" I rarely had anymore of those dreams after that one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome interesting, albeit creepy real-life facts to consider: after my mom's parents died, my mom, aunts and myself cleaned up their house, and I happened to find that exact same mirror underneath a bed in a room that, when I was a lot younger and my grandfather was still alive, he would always yell and call me out of it for some reason. Always felt some kind of dark presence in parts of that house and their backyard shack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy grandfather was a Shriner Freemason, and according to my mom he was very abusive towards her when she was young; she didn't really like to talk about it much. Also when my mom and her two sisters were young they messed around with a Ouija board once (hopefully just once, although it only takes one time). There's a lot of strange things involving myself and my family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw pale-colored, non-human creatures in my room once when I was really young... I remember hallucinating (if it was a grey alien abduction or abduction attempt, they are said to hypnotize and cause hallucinations with their eyes and bodily movements) and crawling to the door. Then I heard my mother call for me from across the house, and I had enough willpower to go to her. As soon as I exited my room, everything went pitch black for a couple of minutes... my vision was mostly gone and my awareness was screwed up, but both came back to me soon after feeling my way down the hallway in my mom's direction. I led her back to my room, but whoever or whatever was there was gone without a trace. Before she died in 2010, she told me that she remembered that occurrence, and for some reason she was the one to use the word \"creatures\". I'm fairly certain that I'm not being told everything, and I just know deep down that whatever I saw was real. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo friends and I briefly witnessed a V-shaped UFO in Tulsa, Oklahoma one night back in April 2009. It was huge, seemingly cloaked (besides the dim lights), transparent or semitransparent, slow-moving and completely silent. So far the only unidentified craft I've seen, to my knowledge. On a related note, one of my paternal uncles was in the military; he actively researched UFOs for unknown reasons (he's very secretive about such things) and has at least one or two books about them.",

There was a man standing at the end of the isle closest to me he was about 20 feet away from me just staring in my direction I look behind me and there isn‚Äôt anyone standing there so I look back at him and his eyes were a different color and bright. His eyes were a good color but what looked like magma in it i stood there staring at him for a minute and his eyes faded back to dark brown and he walked past me to the hostess donuts grabbed his chin in thought and smiled. The reason why I‚Äôm asking this is if anyone else has experienced anything like this or if I just hallucinated his eyes.",

A few minutes after I hear the knocking again and I just asked \"Mom?\", again no answer. By the third time this happened I was genuinely scared and decided to not even look back, I was nervous and sweating, at this point I lost the track of time al I can actually remember is the delightful sound of the main gate opening and my mom's voice announcing her self, she turn on the lights and I hugged her, she ask me is everything was OK? I said yes.\n\n\nThat's it, I hope it's understandable, I do not look for an explanation, just wanted to share this.",

        "text": "So I had this experience years ago back in college, so details are a bit fuzzy. My 3rd year of getting my engineering degree I had an encounter(?) with an orb. I had gotten to bed before midnight (a rare luxury that semester) and I woke up around 3am to a very high pitched noise. The nose was somewhere between tinnitus, and a screeching violin. As I looked around the room I saw this white orb with a red aura(?) radiating from it at the foot of my bed. I tried to yell, but I couldn't. As soon as I saw the orb the sound stopped, and the orb just faded away. At the time I just chocked it up to stress, and possible minor sleep paralysis (I was able to sit up in my bed and look around my room.) My roommate did not appear affected by this since he was still asleep. This was back in 2014, and I haven't had any experiences like it since. For some reason I remembered this event during my lunch today, and apparently orbs are a thing. I will admit, I am very inexperienced when it comes to any sort of paranormal activity. I like to think of myself as an open-minded skeptic, and I am open to any info on orbs. I just want to know more about what they may be (besides a hallucination.) Most of the info I found on them was just about what their color meant.",

        "text": "This is my first post and I don't really know where to start, so forgive me if this is blunt. I feel as if I'm being followed, and have felt this why since I was a child. It's almost like I feel someone or something following me around, watching me. I've felt compelled to look in a particular spot in my bedroom, and I've looked at this spot up and down almost instinctively as if I'm staring at a person, but I haven't seen anything. I've tried to resist it, but I physically can't. I've felt a gaze burning into the back of my head. I've heard tapping and even loud knocking. Recently, it's gotten worse, and I'm not entirely sure as to what I should do. It doesn't feel bad or threatening in any way, but I'm beginning to get paranoid, anxious and overwhelmed. It's clear whatever it's after my attention, but I'm not entirely sure why. I've told my family about this and was informed that they've all been through something similar, but nothing as constant. I recorded the tapping in my bedroom while I wasn't inside it and showed them to my aunt the day after, but when I went to play it again for my grandfather, it was gone. I couldn't hear it anymore.\n\nLast night at around 3:20AM, just as I was about to fall asleep, I heard what sounded like someone slamming their fist on my fireplace. Last week, I heard an unfamiliar woman's voice in my bedroom, but I was unable to make out what she said. Just an hour ago, it felt as if someone blew into my ear.\n\nOn Tuesday, I dreamt of a car accident and the next day, I heard tires screeching on the road outside my house, then an ambulance and a police cruiser drove in that direction. I don't believe it was a coincidence. I've had dreams that came true before. I dreamt of my grandmother dying months before she was diagnosed with cancer. In my old house, I found a small piece of glass in my bed and, thinking nothing of it, I threw it out. The next day and the day after, the same piece of glass appeared. I'm not sure what else to do. It won't leave, and I can't sleep at night. I'm beginning to get desperate. If anyone has any advice for me or could potentially give me an idea as to what is following me, it would be greatly appreciated.",

As I approached the bushes, I noticed that the leaves were rustling in an unusual manner.\n\nAs I got closer, a strange creature emerged from the bushes. It had the body of a deer, but its face was that of a human. I was both terrified and intrigued by this strange creature. It had the ability to morph into different forms, which made me think it was a skinwalker.\n\nThe creature introduced itself to me as Skippy, and it claimed to be an interdimensional being. Skippy was goofy and friendly, and we hit it off right away. He had a quirky personality and a sense of humor that made me laugh.\n\nSkippy told me that he was on a mission to explore different dimensions, and he needed a human companion to help him navigate the world. He promised to take me on an adventure of a lifetime and show me things I had never seen before.\n\nAs we traveled through different dimensions, Skippy showed me things that were both weird and fascinating. We visited a dimension where everything was made out of candy, and we even got to taste some of the delicious treats. We also visited a dimension where the trees were made of gold and the sky was pink.\n\nThroughout our adventures, Skippy was always there to make me laugh and help me overcome my fears. He showed me that life was not always about taking things seriously and that sometimes it was important to let loose and have fun.\n\nAs our journey came to an end, Skippy revealed to me that he had a special gift for me. He gave me a small crystal that he said would help me see things in a new light and find joy in even the most difficult situations.\n\nSince that day, I have been more open to new experiences and have learned to appreciate the small things in life. Skippy may have been a strange and goofy interdimensional being, but he taught me valuable lessons that have changed my life forever.",

        "text": "First time posting on Reddit and might be my last, since I'm not really into this kind of message board thing, but I just had to relay this story and get some feedback. So here goes.\n\nI live near San Francisco and work as an LPN at one of the local hospitals. Since we've been short staffed as of late, I've had to work double shifts for quite awhile and often find myself working graveyard. About a month ago we received a patient whom I'll just call Miguel as all the identification that anyone has found on him is a pair of worn dog tags. Miguel was found about twenty miles off the coast just floating and flown in after being rescued by the Coast Guard. He was sun burned and severely dehydrated. He was wearing one of those green flight suits and like I said, the only identification we found was a pair of dog tags. Miguel was delirious and for the first 24 hours couldn't speak at all, but he quickly stabilized. He was assigned a bed on my floor and was one of the patients I attended. Even though Miguel was stable, he was far from comfortable and would often have panic attacks, ringing for a nurse. When any of us would rush in and ask what was wrong, Miguel would just be staring with his eyes wide in fear and would only ever repeat \"He keeps smiling at me.\" \n\nIn addition he would also begin drawing pictures of a weird man with a wide and freakishly large grin, like The Joker I guess but even more creepy. We tried to keep Miguel calm, but often he would refuse to go to sleep. We never could get this man to speak more than a few words and we looked up the name we found on his dog tags, but couldn't find anybody living around in the area that matched. The real fear on Miguel's face just gave me goosebumps and I couldn't get him out of my mind. Now as an LPN, I've seen some strange things and dealt with some very odd patients, but nothing quite like this. After about seven or eight days, Miguel was checked out of the hospital by some military guys. My brother in law was in the army for a good number of years so I know what the uniform looks like and these guys that checked Miguel out were decked out in full dress greens, I think you call them. Didn't give any background or how they knew Miguel. They just produced some official looking papers and told us that they had legal authority and that Miguel was coming with them. The hospital had no grounds to hold the patient, so he was released. The military guys took everything including all the drawings Miguel had made. Afterward I did some research online and found that Miguel's drawings strongly resembled what some people call The Grinning Man. This was honestly one of the creepiest encounters I've ever had working as a nurse and Miguel is a patient I probably will never forget. I sincerely hope he's ok wherever they took him.",

I initially just assumed the person across from me had pushed their plate and caused a chain reaction, but they were currently cutting some meat and there were INCHES of open space between their plate and the ones that moved. The table was dry, no tablecloth, and I didn't notice anything else move like someone had bumped the table (plus a pretty big heavy table).

        "text": "I was around 15 years old at the time and I was home alone as my parents were out on a business trip when I was awoken in the middle of the night, 2:59 AM, I sat up in bed, had some water and checked the time on my watch. At exactly 3 AM I heard 10 distinct footsteps on the ceiling above my room then a weird squeak I had never heard before followed by a loud thump almost like a dog flopping down on to the floor to sleep, I was on the second floor with only the old unused attic above me, since we had moved in to that house 5-ish years prior we had only ever been up there once when some roof tiles needed to be fixed. I was confused but brushed it off as me just being tired and my mind playing tricks on me, went back to sleep. The next day, 2:59 comes around, I wake up check the time and have some water again, waiting for something to happen. 3 AM on the dot I hear 2 distinct footsteps, and what sounds like a glass of water being put down, this confused me as I was still home alone and this time I was certain it was not just in my head. I was terrified, not knowing what to do but eventually I fell asleep. The next afternoon I built up enough courage to investigate, I grabbed a torch, my katana and my realest looking air soft gun and opened the hatch to the attic, as I climbed the ladder I felt a change in ‚Äúenergy‚Äù, something felt off, there was a little window up there which was never opened by us as nobody ever went up there but for some reason the window was askew, that was the first thing to set off alarm bells, I took a few steps and saw a mat of sorts covered in dust. Next to it was a dust covered candle and you guessed it, a glass of water, also covered in dust. Not sure what to do I put the torch in my mouth, air soft gun in one hand, katana in the other I started to walk around the attic, kicking boxes just waiting for something to happen. But nothing ever did, I closed the window, which had a little lock on it with the key still inside, went downstairs and to this day I‚Äôve never been back up there and I‚Äôve never heard any sounds from up there since then. But what I saw up there was unexplainable and it still sends shivers down my spine every time I think about it.",

        "text": "So this just happened about 3 hours ago, so I‚Äôm gonna write this out while it‚Äôs still fresh.\n\nAbout 3 weeks and 1 day ago, there was a s#icide at my uni campus, apparently they had jumped from the top floor to the ‚Äúbasement area‚Äù (a lower part of the building that‚Äôs open air). Now, I had already woken up that day feeling dread in the air, ever since I was little I‚Äôve felt as if I was connected to spirits and ghosts more than others, but I digress, that‚Äôs a story for another time.\n\nAnyways, last night (or the past 5 hours or so), I decided that I would take some pics of campus when it was dark out, I‚Äôm not sure why, but I couldn‚Äôt (and still can‚Äôt) sleep so I figured might as well take some creepy or liminal pics. So I went out and took the pictures, then I decided to go to this building where the incident happened. \n\nAs soon as I went down the stairs to the lower area I immediately felt unsafe and as if I was being watched. Something definitely felt off, so I tried to take some quick shots and just get out. I took about 4 pictures on the leftmost side of the area then moved to the center part. As soon as I raise my phone to take the picture, I hear something behind me which sounded like a rustling or small crack. I pause and to try and filter the sound out by just not acknowledging it. Not one second later I hear a tremendous and loud CRUNCH from my left/behind me. I‚Äôve never been so frozen in fear in my life. I don‚Äôt even think and I start walking to the right as there were stairs there too. I quickly ran up those stairs then looked back debating with myself if I should check it out or not. I decided to briefly investigate so I went near where I thought the sound came from, peered over the railing and saw nothing. I also feel it important to mention that there is nothing in the basement area that could be capable of making such a noise.\n\nIm back in my dorm now, and out of morbid curiosity I researched what a body sounds like when it hits the ground. Lo and behold, a loud crunching/popping sound.\n\nSo yeah‚Ä¶. \nIm not getting any sleep tonight and I will definitely never go back to anywhere near that building. What do y‚Äôall think it was?",

        "text": "Basically, some time ago I started feeling someone touching me during the night. It's strange, but all of this is making me scared and causing a lot of stress during the night, which in turn is causing me to lose my appetite for sleep. There was a time in my adolescence when I was fascinated by extraterrestrials, especially peaceful civilizations. Whenever I had free time, I would always search for articles on the internet and dream about one day talking to them. But all of this built up a strange feeling inside of me, a fear that I can't seem to shake off. At that time, I was dealing with depression and anxiety, which gave me some motivation to ask for help from the universe. As a result, I became a bit closed off and it's something that I really should have more control over. \n\n This led to a time when a girl appeared at my window one night, i had the blinds open but she was a bit different. I'm sorry, but I don't want to tell too much on what happened because I don't want to have a stress attack, but I can say that from then on, things started to change in my life.  When the girl appeared, it seemed like she was smiling and about to touch her nose, but I closed my eyes out of fear and told her to leave for safety reasons and because I was scared. And then she disappeared. Since i told the girl to go away she didn't touch in my nose.\n\n With this event, it made me a bit worried and led me to have brief panic attacks. I was already dealing with depression at the time due to feelings of sadness and self-hatred. \n\n Continuing on, lately I have been experiencing some light touches during the night, and I don't believe it's my parents because many times they are already asleep and have a \"deep sleep.\"  Believe it or not.",

        "text": " So, I was in my hometown for a few days last month and I went to visit my best friend, who I‚Äôll call Tee. Our catch-ups are always long, as don‚Äôt get to see each other all that often; we live in different parts of New South Wales, Australia.\n\nBoth of us are interested in the paranormal, and we‚Äôve had our fair share of experiences over the years, and talked about them with each other. We‚Äôd never had a paranormal encounter together, until this night. \n\nIt was around 9pm, and my friend was about to drop me home. We strapped in, and drove towards the highway, chatting away, continuing our conversation from when we were inside.\n\nOut of nowhere, the air inside the car began to slowly change. It grew *heavy*, like energy was building; there were tingles rippling down my neck and in between my shoulder blades. Something wasn‚Äôt right. I tried to ignore it, but the feeling kept growing, and the source of it seemed to be in the back seat.\n\nI turned my head just a fraction, and in my peripheral vision, I saw it - a dark, dark shadow of a man sitting passenger behind the driver‚Äôs side. I don‚Äôt know how to explain it, but it seemed damned pleased it was disrupting our night. \n\n‚ÄúTee..it‚Äôs in the car with us,‚Äù I blurted. \n\n‚ÄúI know,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúDo you want to keep driving?‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúYes please.‚Äù I did *not* want this thing following me home. \n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go to the Mount.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúAlright‚Äù\n\nWe tried to keep talking as much as possible, and as normal as possible, but it was hard. We could *feel* this entity trying to latch on.\n\nWe made it to the top of the Mount and walked to the lookout on the far side, as there were already other people around. \n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still here,‚Äù Tee said, as we walked. ‚ÄúIt likes the dark.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYeah, I can feel it.‚Äù My neck and shoulders were still prickling and I sensed - we sensed - it was following. \n\nWe walked down through the gate and stood looking at the lights of town below.\n\nI‚Äôd forgotten the view from up there, and I said as much to Tee. \n\nThen Tee said, ‚ÄúI brought us up here because it‚Äôs a sacred area.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I nodded, understanding straight away\n\nWe kept talking quietly, trying to ignore the presence behind us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSlowly, but surely, it..faded away. After a long moment of silence, Tee said ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs gone.‚Äù\n\nThe uncomfortable prickling I‚Äôd felt had stopped, and I thought I could still sense a bit of *something*, but it might‚Äôve just been adrenaline from such an unnerving experience. \n\nWe waited a few more long minutes before walking back to the car and Tee finally dropped me home. I didn‚Äôt say anything to my mum who was still awake when I got in the door, just said goodnight and went to bed.\n\nEven though I was sure the thing hadn‚Äôt followed me, I didn‚Äôt sleep until the early hours of the morning. \n\nIf anyone has any similar experiences of a shadow person or entity, I‚Äôd like to hear it. Have you ever had one follow you? Let me know in the comments.",

This building was the same in which we had lunch and I remember each time I had to walk past the archives door I felt unsettled and I swear sometimes I could hear weird noises coming from behind it. One day I was given the task of going in the archives to take a cardboard box containing all the files from a given year and I  was stressed out but I had no choice so....\nI remember this strange feeling of disquiet while going up the stairs and when I finally arrived in front of this big damaged door everything was silent. \nI opened the three locks with the key that I was given and I pushed the door to discover a room plunged into darkness and when I turned on the lights I've seen hundred and hundred of cardboard boxes stored in broken shelves and some of them dating back to 1910. \nI was starting to look for the box with the right year on it and the longer I was in this room the more I was feeling oppressed and eventually I found the box I was looking for. It was on a high shelf so in order to reach the box I had raised my hands and as soon as I had grabbed the box I felt a sudden and violent pressure on my throat that made me fall on the ground with the box still in my hands, I had ran away from there as fast as I could locking back the three locks and I had never went back to this room again. \n\nThis moment of my life haunts me until today and I don't know what happened to me.",

        "text": "I'm fascinated by this man's research, his theories on \"the phenomenon\" holds up today better than ever, it actually makes sense. He's a small excerpt:\n\nNow perhaps we can better understand RAF Air Marshal Sir Victor Goddard‚Äôs remarks: ‚ÄúThe astral world of illusion, which is greatly inhabited by illusion-prone spirits, is well known for its multifarious imaginative activities and exhortations. Seemingly some of its denizens are eager to exemplify principalities and powers. Others pronounce upon morality, spirituality, Deity, etc. All of these astral exponents who invoke human consciousness may be sincere, but many of their theses may be framed to propagate some special phantasm‚Ä¶ or simply to astonish and disturb the gullible for the devil of it.‚Äù\n\nThese ‚Äúillusion-prone spirits‚Äù are responsible for nearly all of the UFO appearances and manipulations. The flying saucers do not come from some Buck Rogers-type civilization on some distant planet. They are our next-door neighbors, part of another space-time continuum where life, matter, and energy are radically different from ours. Ancient man knew this and recognized it. The original Biblical texts employed the word sheol, which meant invisible world. Somehow, the translators turned this into ‚Äúhell‚Äù and gave it an entirely different meaning.\n\nAfter spending more than a decade investigating and researching the UFO phenomenon, an engineer named Bryant Reeve published this statement in 1965: ‚Äú‚Ä¶We began to see that vehicles in outer space were not really the important thing. They were merely an indication of something vastly greater, of earthman‚Äôs awakening to a tremendous new awareness.‚Äù\n\nIt had taken Mr. Reeve many years to arrive at a conclusion that had apparently been reached in the halls of Washington long before. In January 1953, the Central Intelligence Agency collected together a group of leading scientists to review the flying saucer evidence compiled by Captain Edward Ruppelt and his Air Force Project Blue Book teams. The final report of this blue-ribbon panel was kept in the classified files for thirteen years and was not released to the press until 1966. In that report, these scientists, some of whom later became recipients of the Nobel Prize, declared:\n\n¬†\n‚Ä¶The Panel noted that the cost in technical manpower effort required to follow up and explain every one of the thousand or more reports received through channels each year could not be justified. It was felt that there will always be sightings, for which complete data is lacking, that can only be explained with disproportionate effort and with a long time delay, if at all. The long delay in explaining a sighting tends to eliminate any intelligence value‚Ä¶ The result is the mass receipt of low-grade reports which tend to overload channels of communication with material quite irrelevant to hostile objects that might someday appear.\n\n The panel agreed generally that this mass of poor-quality reports containing little, if any, scientific data was of no value. Quite the opposite, it was possibly dangerous in having a military service foster public concern in ‚Äúnocturnal meandering lights.‚Äù The implication being, since the interested agency was military, that these objects were or might be potential direct threats to national security. Accordingly, the need for deemphasization made itself apparent‚Ä¶\n\n¬†\nThe panel suggested a program for ‚Äúdebunking‚Äù UFOs and systematically destroying the mystique that had grown up around the subject. ‚ÄúSuch a program,‚Äù the report stated, ‚Äúshould tend to reduce the current gullibility of the public and consequently their susceptibility to clever hostile propaganda.‚Äù\n\nAs part of a plan for deemphasizing the sightings, the Air Force files were closed to newsmen and researchers for several years, and military personnel were forbidden to discuss UFO material with outsiders.",

        "text": " \n\nHello. I am here to share my experiences with paranormal entities, specifically demonic ones. I have encountered these entities on multiple occasions and each time the experience was terrifying. The presence of these beings was accompanied by an overwhelming feeling of dread and fear. I have seen them move objects and heard them whisper in my ear.\n\nFurthermore, I have also had encounters with the ghostly apparitions of my deceased relatives. While these experiences were not as frightening as my encounters with demonic entities, they were still unsettling. I have come to believe that I may be a medium, as I often feel the presence of spirits around me.  \n\nOne recent encounter that comes to mind involves a particularly frightening incident where I was urged by the demonic entities to summon another entity.\n\nIt happened on a late night in my bedroom. I had been feeling a strong presence of negative energy around me for several days, and the presence of the demonic entities was stronger than usual. As I lay in bed, I suddenly heard a voice that was not my own, urging me to summon an entity.\n\nAt first, I tried to ignore the voice and resist its call. But the presence of the demonic entities grew stronger and more insistent, and I found myself feeling compelled to follow their instructions. They instructed me to perform a specific ritual, and I found myself carrying out the steps without fully understanding what I was doing.\n\nAs I completed the final step of the ritual, I suddenly felt a strong, chilling wind blow through my room. It was as if the very air around me had been infused with a malevolent force. I could sense the presence of something dark and powerful in the room with me.\n\nIn that moment, I realized the gravity of what I had done. I had summoned an entity that was beyond my control, and I had no idea what kind of danger I had placed myself in.\n\nSince then, I have been haunted by this experience and have tried to distance myself from the influence of the demonic entities. While I still feel their presence around me, I am more cautious about following their instructions and have been seeking guidance from those who have more experience with the paranormal.\n\nOverall, my experiences with paranormal entities have been both terrifying and enlightening. I have come to realize that there are forces beyond our understanding and that we must approach them with caution and respect. As a medium, I believe that it is my duty to explore and understand these forces, but I also recognize the dangers that come with such pursuits.",

It was supposed to be used to write about our week like a diary and our parents would sign off on it every week. It was also supposed to help us with writing our letters and stuff. But I was a kid who didn‚Äôt take to writing right away and mostly used it to draw stupid things like the cartoons I used to watch. Especially the old powerpuff girls. Anyways I remember this one night the journal was at my feet with the pen on top that my mom used to sign her signature for that week. The family computer was in my room and around this time my mom would stay up really late on chat rooms cheating on my dad. Obviously I didn‚Äôt know this at the time. But she‚Äôd be on the computer super late even after I fell asleep. So this night she was doing that. I woke up in the middle of the night and sat up in my bed. It felt like I wasn‚Äôt moving my body on my own accord. Like I was just a passenger in my body. So I grabbed the journal and opened it to a random page and wrote something down. My head never looked down to see what I wrote. Then I just put the book back and fell asleep. For the longest time I thought it was a weird dream. Until we found the journal. My mom was flipping through it while we were packing stuff to move when I was in high school. So for curiosity sake she flips through every page. Towards the end was this one page that said ‚ÄúFreddy and I want to kill mommy‚Äù. And I told my mom what I‚Äôm telling you guys. It was so weird, I don‚Äôt remember having an imaginary friend named Freddy or anything spooky like that. I just thought it was a weird story to add here. I‚Äôm pretty sure I still have the journal, if I find it, I‚Äôll update this cause it was definitely a surprise when we first saw it.",

        "text": "My husband had tried posting for me yesterday since I am sheepish for telling this to him let alone strangers. He told me tonight he had his post removed from being a third party to the event or something so I'd like to post and maybe bring some clarity. \n\nI feel weird bringing this up in general, but looking for suggestions so here I go. I told my husband maybe it'd be best to provide more backstory might be helpful. \n\nWe had been trying for children  since marriage in 2014. Never conceived after three years; sought medical intervention. Without cause, I was diagnosed with annovulation since there was no reason for us to not conceive; just wasn't happening for us . A few more years passed by and we decided to do an IUI and were successfully pregnant with our first son Dresden. Perfect pregnancy, six months pregnant I started not feeling well late at night went to the hospital and was in preterm labor. We had our son in a few hours and he had passed shortly after he was born. Without cause, no explanation why preterm labor happened. Absolutely tragic. He was born and passed Aug 2021. Seven years of infertility, medical pregnancy, and a loss. I was done. Or least for awhile. When I was spontaneously convinced again two months later with our second son. \n\nThis is where my husband started his post yesterday. Since having our second son in July 2022 is when I first noticed this bird thing; is what I say. I first saw it maybe the night I had our son or the night after. All I remember is it being very very late and I first noticed it. It perches in a window sill , usually around the baby. First when he was two days old in the hospital. Then I never saw it again until a handful of times and now I see it more frequently as our son is now seven months old. Just trying to understand what it is. The obvious here is am I hallucinating? I've been mental health evaluated for the PTSD that I had been having from our first son's sudden passing. And my therapist didn't have much to say about it other than it was odd.  Ive seen it with and without antidepressants. \n\nOverall seen it five maybe six times. I respond seeing it as if you get a feeling someone calls our your name and you do a double take and it's there just perched looking down and away. Or you are passing a room and think you see something in the corner of your eye so double take and yeah there it is.  It's a dark blue or purple with like pink shine to it. Smallish head with a ravens beak and long tail. I don't feel like it's harmful but I'm also not nieve. It never communicates or has never tried to and I'd rather not communicate to it either. But when I saw it most recently it wasn't over our seven months old, it was hanging out with me in the living room ruffling up and just adjusting it's feet. It seemed large though and so I told my husband about it finally and he suggested posting the story here.",

        "text": "I had the smallest bedroom in our family home which was rightfully so because I was the baby. My sister‚Äôs room (she‚Äôs 11 years older than me) was clear on the other side of the house. Located next to her room, was the bathroom. This was only bathroom accessible to me as a child, unless my parents were both awake, then I could maybe slip into their master bathroom. This was pretty rare though. \n\nAll my life that I stayed in the small bedroom,  starting from my earliest memories from age three, I can recall that I always had an intense fear on the other side of the house, where my sisters room and the bathroom was. Especially in the very early morning hours or late at night.\n\nFast forward. When I was 10, my mother decided to move into the larger bedroom since my sister was off to the military. At age 12, in the summer I began staying up very late and sleeping until noon. I remember working on scrapbook projects and gluing things to pages. It was about 3 am and I decided I better quietly get ready for bed and take a bath. In scurried into the bathroom next to my bedroom and started the tub. Then, I sat on the toilet and looked over out passed the bathroom, passed the hallway and into the dining room and quickly saw a pair of very see through white legs with feet that looked identical to my dad‚Äôs scurry by. \n\nWhat‚Äôs unique about the view from the bathroom into the dining room was right in front of me were these set of wood stained saloon doors that you could walk through (the doors swung both ways) to get into that room. The saloon doors covered much of the entry way leaving only the top and bottom of the doors open. Really, all I saw beneath the swinging doors was the feet, with translucent ankles and hardly any leg. Mostly, the leg disappeared. This set of feet walked by in a hurry. What stood out to me about these feet was the second toe was much longer than all the other toes, nearly identical to my dad‚Äôs feet.\n\nThe second I saw this, I jumped up and locked myself in the bathroom. Then, got into the tub. Now in the tub, the thought occurred to me that these clear feet, or entity could be in the bathroom right now with me and I‚Äôd have no idea. I truly was scared. I shook and I rinsed by body quickly to ran back into the bedroom, turning all lights on. I climbed into bed and kept looking all around me.\n\nThat next evening, I quizzed my dad if he‚Äôd been awake last night wandering around the house and he starkly replied no. I remember telling my mom what occurred but was not believed. \n\nThinking back to these memories, I do recall being so scared of this area of the house that when I had to use to bathroom in my youth, age three or four, I would wet myself because I was too afraid to step foot down the hall or even in that direction. \n\nI felt like I sensed things years before they ever showed themselves to me. Curious if this has ever happened to someone else? Would love to hear more about other similar experiences.",

        "text": "I(26f) have always been fascinated by all things paranormal, but there was a time in my life where I didn't totally believe. I was open to the idea of some sort of paranormal entity existing somewhere, but in my heart didn't really put much stock in it. Over the years, that has drastically changed. Here is one of the encounters that made me a believer. \n\nWhen my wife and I were newly married, we were very close with another couple who lived in our area. We would travel with them, double date with them, and we considered them our best friends. One day, they went out of town and asked us to watch their animals for them. They had a cat, a bearded dragon, a red iguana, and 2 rats. We agreed to watch them and they left. \n\nI worked very close to their home, so I would go over to the house once in the morning, once in the afternoon on my lunch hour, and then again in the evening. Usually, I would be alone for the morning and afternoon visit due to my job being closest to their home, and then my wife would join me for the evening visit. \n\nOne day, during my afternoon visit, I purposely left the lights in their home off. They were getting enough natural light through the house to see fairly well without the lights on that day, and I wanted to save them on their electric bill while they were gone. Again, this was a conscious choice to leave their lights off. This was something I actively thought about. I did NOT touch their lights. After I checked on the animals, I went back to work, again leaving every light switch untouched. \n\nWhen my wife and I arrived back that evening, I froze in the driveway. I could see from where I was standing outside that the entry way and hallway lights were both on. I told my wife \"I didn't turn those lights on. I didn't touch them.\" She asked me if I was sure, and I told her that I was 1000% sure. We thought that maybe someone from their HOA had come by, or one of their family members. Or... that someone had noticed that they were out of town and broken in. We each put a car key between our knuckles and entered the house. \n\nThe house was eerily quiet. I couldn't hear any of the animals moving around, and the air felt stale. Like... I could have choked on it stale. We slowly made our way through the house, checking closets and looking for any sign of disturbance. Every light was on in every room that we entered. After we had checked every room and absolutely nothing was out of place, we both relaxed... somewhat. I even started to gaslight myself into believing that I had somehow turned on every single light in every single room... even the rooms I hadn't entered. \n\nSuddenly, we heard a loud THUD come from the reptile room, the one we had literally just left. The thud was loud enough that the house shook. We threw the door open, and nothing was disturbed. Nothing had fallen, nothing had moved. Not an inch. The only thing that had changed was the bearded dragon. \n\nThe bearded Dragon's enclosure was large and positioned on the floor, with a sliding glass door front. The dragon, who had been peacefully resting when we'd checked just a minute before, was now rhythmically tapping its nose against the glass in a perfect pattern. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Over and over again. It was almost robotic. I stared in disbelief, I had never seen an animal behave like that before. I walked over to the enclosure and gently slid the glass door open. The dragon continued trying to tap on the glass even though it was no longer there for another second or two, and then suddenly its beard went pitch black. It scrambled out of the enclosure and took off across the floor, headed straight for the door. Luckily, my wife was able to close the door before he escaped. Once he reached the door, he started rhythmically tapping on it in the same pattern he had on the glass. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. \n\nSuddenly, on the other side of the door, we heard another loud thud, even louder than the first one, and in the same second, the cat started screaming. Not meowing. SCREAMING. It was a horrible sound, but I didn't have time to react before I heard clanging and clattering in the other enclosures behind me. The iguana was wildly whipping its tail against the sides of the enclosure and almost... hissing? It was a horrifying sight. \n\nI quickly picked up the bearded dragon and put him back in his enclosure (where he continued tapping immediately) while my wife grabbed for the doorknob. I'll never forget the fear and disbelief in her voice when she said \"It won't open.\" I flew to the door and started yanking as hard as I cook. The knob wouldn't even turn. Not like it was broken... like someone was holding it from the other side. I started banging on the door, and screaming, true panic setting in. My head felt fuzzy, my chest felt tight, and I almost thought I was going to pass out. \n\nThen, suddenly, it all stopped. The cat stopped screaming. The iguana stopped whipping. The dragon stopped tapping, and the door knob was easily moved. When we left that room, the rest of the lights in the house were now off. \n\nMy wife and I bolted out of the house as fast as we could and were silent the whole drive home. The next day, I had almost convinced myself that it was a fluke, and that the animals had upset each other. I talked to my friend to tell her about the weird experience, to which she replied \"Oh. I forgot to mention. We've been having... activity in the house lately.\" \n\n\"What do you mean by activity?\" I responded.   \n\n\nTo which, she explained that the former resident of her home had been an elderly man that passed away in the home after owning it for 40 years. She told me that ever since they had started their renovations, she had seen a male figure standing in the corners of the home or base of the stairs. That he would rile the animals up. And that he would often mess with the lights in the house. She said he had never been violent. More mischievous. As if he was throwing little fits about the changes they were making. \n\nAfter that, I reevaluated my whole outlook on my belief in the paranormal. I sure as hell believe now.",

        "text": "Ever since I was little, I've been able to sense demonic presence.\n\nIt started when I was 5. We lived in an old farmhouse. The basement was concrete walled with a dirt floor. The staircase came down the middle with the basement effectively being split in half. On one half, my dad had his TV and smoking spot. On the other side though...it was so dark. Unnaturally dark. Just looking into the dark corner made me feel like I was in imminent danger. The hairs on my neck would stand up. I avoided the basement as much as possible growing up because of it. I told my parents and they told me it was in my imagination. \n\nWe moved into town when I was 9. The woman who purchased the house after us, about 4 months later, began seeing a floating apparition in the same unnaturally dark corner of the basement. She had the house blessed by a priest. \n\nAnother second overwhelming instance happened when I was 24. I moved into an old house in the country (moved from out of state and didn't get to see it in person before hand.) Again, concrete walled with concrete floors. There was a giant table covered in sand and next to it? The huge oil drum for the oil based heating for the home. The second I walked into this house I was filled with dread. Toe curling, make you sweat dread. The anxiety and panic I felt resulted in me putting padlocks on the attic and basement (not that that would stop any entity but it gave me a little piece of mind.) I spent as little time as I could there. I felt like I was being watched. I could hear noises coming from the basement. I was folding laundry in my room one night and saw a black shadow run past me that legitimately made me scream. I moved out after a month. \n\nThose are my two most vivid memories but there have been soooo many instances where I feel this way. I can walk into any building and tell immediately if there is an otherworldly presence that's malicious in nature. It's even happened when I'm outside at various locations. \n\n My family and friends don't believe me. They make me doubt myself but I have no other explanation for the feelings I feel. It's the strongest feeling of absolute horror, I can't even describe it accurately in words. It feels like there's a demon standing right behind me, watching me, and waiting for it's opportunity. I don't know what to do.",

When I came home from the hospital with her, I think something dark came back with us. Either that or it was something attached to my ex (her ‚Äúfather‚Äù) because that was when he moved in too. He was a dark person, interested in demons, and he was going through addiction so I would not be surprised if he brought it. Anyway, shortly after I gave birth my ex and I noticed a presence in the bedroom we were sleeping in at my parents house. He heard a female singing voice in there and thought it was the ghost of my Grandma since the room we were sleeping in was hers before she died. Then I started having nightmares about a tall, bony female figure with long stringy hair. I strongly felt her presence in the room and I would see her as soon as I‚Äôd close my eyes at night. Before having my baby, the room felt totally normal. I became so afraid of that room that I‚Äôd avoid it at all costs until bedtime, and every time I‚Äôd open the door I was expecting to see her there. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone because I felt crazy, and then my ex started woke up with scratches all over his chest and back. He mentioned a nightmare about a demonic woman. I asked him to describe her to me and he described the exact same figure I was dreaming about. I continued avoiding the room in the daytime and just dealt with the creepy feelings at night. After I left him, the nightmares started subsiding. One night when my daughter was about a year old, I stayed up all night cleaning and reorganizing things in the living room area. My daughter was upstairs asleep. My parents were upstairs asleep. It was 3am. I heard, clear as day, a woman singing ‚Äúmerrily merrily merrily life is but a dream‚Äù in the bedroom. I thought it was my mom but she was asleep. My daughter had no toys that sang that song. \n\nWe moved out a few years later and there were no more encounters. \n\nI actually mostly forgot about her. Until for some reason, last year I had a dream about her again. My husband was away for a business trip and my daughter slept in bed with me. In the dream I was laying in bed with my daughter the same way we fell asleep, except I was in that bedroom in my parents house. I was lol facing the closet and the lady was standing there looking at us. Then I ‚Äúfell asleep‚Äù in the dream and ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù in another dream where I became semi lucid. I knew I was dreaming but something felt off and I was uncomfortable so I shouted ‚ÄúI wanna wake up.‚Äù I ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù again in the room again and the woman was still there staring at my daughter. I then ACTUALLY woke up to my daughter crying and shaking me. She said ‚Äúis she real?‚Äù \nMy stomach dropped lol and I asked ‚Äúis who real?‚Äù \nShe said ‚Äúthe lady‚Äù üò≥\n‚ÄúWhat lady?‚Äù \nAnd she goes, ‚Äúthe lady in the bedroom at Pop and Mimi‚Äôs house‚Äù\nSo now I‚Äôm wide awake and terrified and I have questions. I asked what the lady looks like and she described the same one, bony, long dark hair, tall, everything except for one detail. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have legs. She has wheels instead.‚Äù I asked if she‚Äôs ever seen her at Pop and Mimi‚Äôs house. She said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I can‚Äôt remember if it was dreams or if it was real. Is she real?‚Äù I told her I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs real, because my daughter is very sensitive and easily scared so I figured it would be better if she just forgets. Really freaky. We haven‚Äôt had anymore dreams since.",

I fought this, which felt something like my entire body being stretched like bungee cords whilst I was trying to make it to the end of an obstacle course.\n\nMost recently in Tunisia, I had the weirdest dream that my girlfriend was with me in the bed I‚Äôm currently sleeping in (she‚Äôs still in London) only when I went to embrace her, she just disappeared.

        "text": "I‚Äôve been reading but not posted before. I feel like I want to tell my situation with my family and our experiences.  Maybe it‚Äôs nothing. Maybe there is something to it or maybe I am just hopeful.  Figured maybe I could get insight. I am not a new believer in the paranormal.  Several bad Oija board experiences in my teens made that clear.  I‚Äôm just not versed in specifics of the paranormal. \n\nSome back story- my Great Grandmother was always said to be born with a ‚Äúveil‚Äù over her (something with amniotic sac). She lived with my Grandparents in an old house that had tunnels and said to be part of the Underground Railroad  (most have collapsed over the years).  It‚Äôs been written about in a local historians haunted house book.  My Great-Grandmother used to see men carrying bodies to the basement.  She would always talk about the little boy and girl causing trouble on her side of the house or them looking at her jewelry.  One time it was the boy asking for water. Frankly, many of my family acted as if she was crazy (non-Believer portion).  I was of the believer side of our family and she passed one year the day before Halloween. I fully expected her to appear on Halloween and be like ‚Äúsee and you all called me crazy.‚Äù üòÇ \n\nAnother incident at the house was with my Grandfather who was working outside in the heat and felt someone put their hand on his shoulder and tell him he should go inside. No one was there. Another time, while home alone, he was not feeling well while down in the basement doing some work.  My Grandmother got home and he was on the sofa and wasn‚Äôt sure how he got from the basement.  \n\nMany (20 years later). I took my Grandmother to a medium a few times after her mom and my Grandfather had passed .  My Grandfather passed young and she spent til she passed just as committed to him as when he was here and she enjoyed it. Every time, the medium would see a curly hair little girl by me. Would ask if we knew her and say she is really interested in you and we‚Äôd all be stumped and move on. After three boys, I had my daughter. Unlike all my other kids she had a head full of curls. We ran into the medium when she was about one and she said ‚Äúthat was her!‚Äù  My daughter was born completely in her amniotic sac.  The most amazing sight.  Too bad we always forgot the camera!  She had to be cut free from it. Her and my Grandmother had this amazing bond. From the instant they saw eachother and til my Grandmothers passing there was just this automatic comfort they found in oneanother.  Not the way my daughter was with others at all. \n\nTil she was 6, my daughter has had several moments that would make me stop and pause and wonder.  Not just being born like my great grandmother. When she was 3, she told me how I was so tiny as a baby and how she used to rock me all the time. I tried to correct her that I rocked her and she insisted she rocked me and I was so tiny and cute. I was preemie. All I could think was is she like my Great Grandma reborn?!? Crazy, I know. \n\nAt one point I got into geneology and did Ancestry DNA on like every grandparent, parent and kid to see who had what percent of each.  My Grandmother matched all my boys just as you would expect for a Great Grandmother.  My daughter shared more DNA with her than her Grandmother. They came up as closer than Great Grandmother.  I found it interesting because the bond they immediately had. \n\nA few years later, in April 2020, my Grandmother passed. For two years, til just the past 6 months, my daughter would always say Great Grandma is here.  One time she was playing alone in her playroom and I could see her talking and having a blast by herself and asked what she was playing. She told me Great Grandma is laying dolls with me. My Grandmother LOVED dolls.  Growing up she was poor and had one doll that was it her while childhood. As an adult, she collected everything from baby dolls to porcelain dolls. Her upstairs was a little creepy with all the dolls (not to mention the haunted house she lived in). Anyway, I said to my daughter you are that‚Äôs great. You look like you are both having lots of fun. She said we are take our picture!  So I humored her and did.  It was a ‚ÄúLive Photo‚Äù on my phone and when I looked at it there was a white shadow all around one side and around my daughters head.  She is laughing looking up at it.  On the side there is a white shadow shape of a closed hand.  I was like okay maybe she was.  üíó\n\nMaybe I am thinking too much and seeing things there that aren‚Äôt out of grief and finding comfort there. \n\nThe last thing my Grandmother said to me when I was crying beside her was ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be seeing you‚Äù over and over and saying my daughters name.  She wasn't with me.  It was in a tone like thus is no big deal I am gonna be here. The next day she could no longer speak and passed soon after. \n\nI have a few pics of what appear to be faces in my grandmothers basement.  We took them when my son was remote learning with Covid and learning about the Underground  railroad. I also have the pic of my Daughter playing. I would be happy to share them I just don‚Äôt know how to post pics.  They  are on my phone so I don‚Äôt know how to post them.  \n\nThanks for reading and in advance for any insight.",

        "text": "\n\nSo the reason for these questions is that a good friend of mine is experiencing more and more ghost-related stuff at home. It started about one to two years ago. He lives with his brother and mother in a very old house. \nOne evening he was alone at home lying in bed when he heard a knocking on his door. He thought his family had come home early and asked what was up. \nHe got no response so he checked the door and there was no one around. Since then the knocking came more often in the evening but never more than one time in one night. It knocks two to three times slowly and then stops. \n\nWe regularly speak on the phone in the evening and even heard the knocking. He then always goes to check the door but there is nothing. \nIn case someone was wondering, no he never asked the ghost to come in or invited it otherwise into his room. \n\nSo one day he asked his family about it, if they had something like this too. They both stated that they also had the knocking on their doors frequently. His mother also said that one night she felt something big crawl into her bed (no, they don't have a cat or other pets). \nAnd last night his mother was standing in her room when she heard some heavy breathing next to her. It seems that the ghost is manifesting stronger in the house over time. My friend also said that the knocking got a little louder over time\n\nI heard from a different friend that if a ghost knocked three times that it stands for Trinity and is a sign of an evil spirit.\n\nSo since am very invested in these events I was thinking to myself that one could perhaps contact the ghost or could prevent it from doing harm to the family.\n\nMaybe someone out there knows how to deal with or act in this situation",

        "text": "Hello, \n\nI have lived in the south of France since I was little. My grandfather owns a sheepfold in a village extension located a few kilometers away in the mountains. In the place where the sheepfold is located there are a few buildings nearby, including a hunter's house, so no one is there at night, and some farmhouses, inhabited or not, further away. The sheepfold is fenced so that the dogs locked in their kennels cannot escape if they get out, so that the sheep do not run away either, and so that no other animals enter the property. The property being on a few hectares there is a large sheepfold and in front of it at 100 meters a small meadow made to eat or even to take a nap. I've been coming here often since I was a child, we have meals, parties and work. We have already come to sleep with tents or even in the prefab. \n\nOne day my girlfriend and I decided to sleep in the sheepfold in the prefab one night when we left in the late afternoon. In the evening it was already dark. We were playing a game of darts when we decided to take a break. At that moment we were not making much noise. Heavy footsteps on the concrete surrounding the prefab were heard. There were 5-6 of them and they sounded like human footsteps or standing with hard shoes. The footsteps seemed to be going towards the door. The only window was closed but it was impossible to close the door completely. I said aloud \"is anyone there?\". The footsteps suddenly stopped. My girlfriend went out to open the door to see what was there because for her (without telling me) she thought it was my grandfather. To her great surprise there was nobody, we quickly went around the prefab but nothing, no sign of life around. We left and slept elsewhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe told the story to my grandfather, it made him laugh. He told us that he had slept there many times alone and that nothing had happened. He said that it was probably a sheep from the field below that had come. But do sheep walk upright? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any guesses, I'd love to hear them.",

        "text": "Hi all. I will try and keep this short and to the point. For about 5 years I have suspected I have some sort of \"Attachment\". I haven't reached out to anyone regarding this until today. Things are progressing, and not in a good way. I am an empath, and I figured I could handle this on my own, but I figured wrong. \n\nThis all started when my husband and I moved into a new rental. Right from the start things began happening; objects would disappear and end up in odd places (hair brush in the refrigerator, silverware in clothes closet). My husband experienced sleep paralysis and the \"Hag\" phenomena. This had not happened before we moved into this house. \n\nThe last straw was when the house was completely empty one night, at about 3:00 am, and I was outside on the porch having a smoke. All at once, every light turned on, the radio began playing and the front door slammed shut. We moved the next week, but I fear whatever was there followed us. I am experiencing almost every symptom of attachment, but I don't know what this is! I am depressed, anxious and I frequently wake up with unexplained bruises and abrasions. I have nightmares and I hear whispering and sometimes music playing, but no radio on. I experience cold spots and shadows. More often than not I just feel defeated, nothing ever goes right. I honestly feel like I am cursed! To make matters worse, I just lost my mother to cancer. \n\nVirtually every day I have this \"Unsettled\" feeling, like something just isn't right. These feelings are uncharacteristic, as I am normally very outgoing and positive. I now spend my days in my bedroom, isolated from my family and friends \n\nI don't know where to turn. I am hoping someone in the community can help me.",

One of my older cousins had brought over a Ouija bored and tried to get us all to play with it. a few of us being as young as were were had to have it explained to us and immediately said ‚Äúno‚Äù but a few of my other cousins wanted to try it and made fun of a few of us who didn‚Äôt want any part in it. So they proceeded to head into one of the bedrooms while I and some of my other cousins stayed in the living room‚Ä¶some time had passed by and we started to hear screaming coming from the room.\n\nWe had thought they were just trying to scare us so we decided to ignore them, until they all ran out of the room with nothing but fear all over their faces screaming saying the bored had flew across the room and a large dark figure was in the room with them.  and again we were still on edge not sure if they were playing with us until one of my older cousin had a full break down and we have never seen him react in that way, he just wasn‚Äôt that type to show any emotions in that way. He kept muttering saying he heard it say something to him and ever since that day he wasn‚Äôt the same, we never once figured out what he heard and has been admitted to a psychiatric facility for years",

        "text": "So I been reading more. Every couple nights I hear my dog that died 6 months ago, barking in my front yard. I live in the cut like in the woods. So I been hearing this dead dog barking and then seen the rake, and my water heater been shutting off randomly every night and when I go outside to turn it back on in my chonies with a flashlight, I hear footsteps and breathing. Again. Am I just fucking going full crazy? Do I have cte or schizophrenia? Or is this shit really happening? I‚Äôm not scared of this thing, I got too much shit going on to really give it too much attention, but it‚Äôs been fucking with me and I can‚Äôt unsee him. He‚Äôs in my head now and it‚Äôs fucking me up when I gotta be focusing on shit at work.",

        "text": "A couple of years ago I had this dream, lately I can't get it out of my head and I'm going crazy.\n\nIt started with me and my cousins ‚Äã‚Äãdriving ATVs, one of my cousins ‚Äã‚Äãaccidentally entered an abandoned school and I had to go after him to make sure he was okay, he came out calmly driving his ATV and I I got trapped in an empty classroom but with a strange vibe that made me leave as soon as possible.\n\nLeaving the abandoned school, I discovered that my cousins ‚Äã‚Äãhad abandoned me, going to our grandmother's house on their own. As I passed in front of the school entrance, I noticed a group of forensics around an excavated area. What I saw made me nauseated: a rotting corpse of a woman, I moved away and ran to my grandmother's house.\n\nI opened the door, tired from having run so much, in the room they were all standing behind my grandmother who was holding a photograph up high, I approached the hustle and bustle to observe the photograph of a young woman around 20 years old, black and curly hair and a typical dress of the wealthy girls of the last century. they all started talking, the only words i understood were \"Elvira\" and \"Sister\", then I woke up.\n\nThe mere image of the corpse took away my appetite for two days.\n\nI told my mom my dream, she looked at me for a while with a mixture of feelings that I couldn't distinguish, she told me to tell my grandmother my dream when we went to see her and that was the first thing I did when the weekend arrived and we went to her house.\n\nMy grandmother (named Elvira, with curly hair, more gray than black due to age) told me that the woman in the photograph of my dream was not her, but rather her aunt, who died of unknown causes when she was young, and that her mother, my great-grandmother, called her Elvira after her sister.\n\nIn fact, it was not the only time that I dreamed of deceased people that I did not know in life.\n\nSome time later I dreamed of the grandfather of an internet friend, I remember her grandfather's clothing: old jean pants with stains, a worn-out t-shirt that seemed more white than blue and dirty shoes, she told me that those were the clothes  that he wore  when he passed away\n\nIn my dream her grandfather remained standing and gave a warning to her, her cousins ‚Äã‚Äãand me, I omitted this detail when I told her about my dream because I thought it would not be important, the last thing I knew from her was that she was sick and some time later the pandemic.\n\nAt the end of that year I had another dream which consisted of parents on the verge of tears, telling their son who was around 5 years old that they would always love him, there was a growing fire not far away.\n\nWhen my best friend and I became more confident, he told me that he was actually adopted, that his parents died in an accidental fire when he was a child and that he was saved because he was playing in the garden, I told him my dream and the description of the people in my dream, he cried and I didn't know what to do.\n\nMy dreams are usually creepy, but it's not very common to dream about a deceased relative that even my mother didn't know or about relatives of people I met on the internet.\n\nI have told several people about these dreams, no one has told me that something similar has happened to them, in fact they just stare at me strangely and nothing more, I think I'll go crazy if I don't get answers",
