        "text": "&gt;Many of the flesh-fields were still automated; mechanical limbs speeding through the gloom, spraying the vats with nutrients, lifting crops and depositing fresh stem-stock, all with the minimum of human input. But the machines were ancient, and nothing lasted forever. Gradually, year by year, more of the flesh farming industry was losing its automation. Software was often the root of the problem. They could repair and replace components, but sooner or later the changing nature of the machine would collide violently with its untouched, unmodified software... code like mystical runes, written in languages nobody could remember. Accidents would happen.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the summer of the Year of the Flame 1027, a loading machine spontaneously forgot the existence of its load. It dropped a fully-laden vat on three men, crushing them beneath the weight of both metal and meat. One week later, another man lost his arm when a mechanised guillotine failed to identify an obstruction, and set about deftly slicing the crop ready for harvest. These were not isolated incidents. The farmers were bleeding on their fields of flesh, and yet in spite of this, their bodies were outnumbered.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Plantation by plantation, company by company, automation was being retired, first as a result of technical failure and injury, then in anticipation of it. And as once machine-dominated roles were handed back to the humans, human nature ensured that the transition would never be easy.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Traditionally, the fields were tended to by the Corks. The c*ore-kin*. They of pale skin and dark eyes, who lived quietly in half-hidden communities down in the deeper tunnels, having done so since the earliest days. The ways of the core-kin were older than the ancient plantation machines; while the people of the Leanings and the Upper Streets had grown accustomed to the knowledge that life existed beyond the city, that it had grown numerous and cheap, the Corks still lived as if humanity were in danger of vanishing. As if they were the only humans left. They wasted nothing, valued life, and taught their children that contribution was continuity; that mankind would only survive if it *earned* that right.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Reserved, reasonable, frugal and patient, the Cork population was unsurprisingly low. Thus, with automation of the fields waning, new farmers were needed, and most of them were recruited from the dappled sunlight of the Leanings, high above. Such new recruits had spent most of their lives with the reassuring cycle of day and night, artificial though it may have been. They were unaccustomed to the perpetual darkness of the plantation caverns.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;When the first team of new recruits was trained on the Fairbanks Plantation that year, half of them promptly developed insomnia and, over time, vitamin deficiency, while several became so emotionally unstable they were dangerous to work with. Some of the men told stories of otherwise cheerful and benign colleagues who had started beating their wives and children in fits of sleep-deprived madness. Then of course, there was the incident with Frederick Harris.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;   “I do believe I got some Fred in my lunch today.”   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Gallows humour. Big laughs all around. Frederick Harris was another victim of the fields. Mistakenly believing that drink would help him sleep, he wandered the plantation late one night, lost in an amber haze. He slipped, cracked his head, fell into a vat and drowned in the meat, unconscious and unnoticed. By the time his body was found, the meat had fed upon the corpse like any other source of nutrients; Frederick Harris became *part* of the meat. The whole vat had to be emptied, for its crop could no longer pass DNA standards for the human content threshold. The men who tended to that particular grid lost a month’s pay, such was the value of the crop, and Frederick Harris was doomed to be remembered with bitterness.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;He was not alone. Organised crime in the city had long since learned a valuable lesson about the meat-farming industry; that the meat did not merely dissolve and absorb organic matter, it *merged* with that matter. It reassembled as it consumed, turning the corpse into more of itself. Thus, even if a body hadn’t dissolved fully before it was recovered, contamination from the meat meant that DNA testing of the corpse would never stand up in court. It was perfect. Dumping a body in the vats meant erasing a person. Turning them, quite literally, into raw meat.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Or, as they had come to be known, s*andwich men.*    \n&gt;  \n&gt;   This was what the farmers called them, so numerous were the bodies that the horror of their discovery was worn down into a grim joke. It became an inevitability of the farming process, and part of the daily routine; to walk the gantries, inspecting the greasy grey-pink fields for the telltale signs of a sandwich man... a stray shoe perhaps, or a subtle indentation left by a recent fall. Or a hand protruding from that sea of meat as if pitifully waving for assistance...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0vg2rfjoiaa1.png?width=598&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f25026986993f6cd98bfb0c4965d13a899827754",

I recently wrote and directed Season 1 of the indie sci-fi web series [JijiColony](https://jijicolony.com/), which is about life on an interstellar colony ship after it has left earth. Season 1 was primarily about trying to solve a hydroponic crop failure on board one of the ships that resulted in the colony potentially starving in space. \n\nThe storyline for Season 2 (currently in pre-production) follows many of the same characters, but has more to do with social structures, personal issues, conspiracies, politics, and so on. They're all driven by the unique situations and circumstances of being on a colony ship, but I have a lingering concern about it not being \"science-y\" enough.\n\nThe overall approach to the show is generally hard sci-fi, and things like the ship layout, foods they eat, etc., are all grounded in that approach, but I just wonder how much of the story and interactions has to be driven specifically by science (as it more obviously was in Season 1), or if it's okay to explore more personal/interpersonal/social issues that emerge from a hard sci-fi concept but aren't specifically science-driven conflicts.\n\nBasically, I just wanted to ask, how much \"sci\" do you expect to have in your sci-fi?",

        "text": "Unfortunately I cannot remember the actors/ actresses. The lead actor in the opening scene strolls into a building filled with gunmen quite casually acting cavalier where he is looking for a hostage, he is lead to a room where he is really calm and cool while they cut his head off with a machete. He wakes up in the boot of his car outside the building and gets out then proceeds to grab an m16 and storms the building killing all the gunmen and rescuing the hostage and finding his own body. The rest of the series goes that he works for an agency and he has android bodies and can upload and download to them and the have depots around the world for missions. The series ends up when an ai gaining consciousness and reaching the singularity and in the end the guy goes in to meet the ai and ends up fading away in the ai digital realm\n\nI first saw this on YouTube as a mini series put together as a film/movie. I think. I also think it may have been fan/amateur made but I cannot remember for sure. I could swear domhnall gleeson was in it but I checked his history and I don’t think he was. \n\nCan anyone remember or tell me the name of this show? Almost certain it was made between 2005 and 2015",

And I want to start reading a bit more modern sci-fi, but whenever this question is asked a majority of the answers are trilogies or a multi-book series. \n\nNow,  I’m not completely opposed to a multi book series, but I kind of prefer a one and done self-contained book. Or, even a book where just reading the first one leaves me pretty satisfied. A lot of the books that I really enjoyed in the past, have multiple sequels, but I never get around to reading them. Rama, Ringworld, Eon… though I did read all the 2001 books though. \n\nSo I would love to hear some recommendations on science fiction books written in the past 20 or so years, that are one off novels. Or something where reading the sequels isn’t really required. \n\nAs far as the kind of books I enjoy, I like big dumb object type stories, something a bit more grounded in reality, with some science,mystery and discovery. \n\nI love movies like the Arrival, Contact, Interstellar, and Logan’s Run (I’ve read the books as well.) As for books I really loved Rendezvous with Rama, Childhood’s End, 2001, Eon, Contact, and a short story called For a breathe I terry. \n\nEven though I really enjoyed The Expanse TV series, I’m not sure I would enjoy reading it. \n\nAnyways, I’m still interested in checking out a lot of the book series is that are recommended here, like the three body problem, but I’m just curious if there are some good one-off novels that y’all recommend.",

Plot: Basically, in the future, frozen humans were thawed, in order to be studied by scientists. There is one individual that stands out, and the scientists end up being cats. They are blown away because he called them out as being so.\n\nSorry, his synopsis is crude, but that's what brought me here. Any guesses would be amazing. Thank you!",
