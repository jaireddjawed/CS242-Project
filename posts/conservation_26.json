        "text": "Hi, Reddit, I am 16 year old. Animals have always been a big part of my life and a passion of mine, and after thinking about it for quite awhile, I think I would like to go into conservation of some sort. I really like birds, specifically parrots, but I love all birds. I also am really fond of rhinoceroses. So I guess my question is, how could I go about working in conservation? I'm ignorant when it comes to college and majors and stuff, but what exactly would I need to do?? When I was little, it was always a dream of mine to work with birds somewhere in Central or South America or in South Africa with rhinos, and honestly that dream has never really gone away. Would that be possible, or is like I said just a dream? Could I, a some teenager from the US, eventually do something like this? How?\n\nSorry if this isn't really the right subreddit, I've been thinking about my future a lot recently and I just needed to ask some questions.\n",

And in Maine, where mild winters are increasingly subjecting moose to severe tick infestations, it seems that drones could be used to fly 1 or 2 feet over the backs of the animals to apply insecticide.  The technology is hardly complicated:  Hover and spray.  One drone could treat several dozen moose per day.  (Eventually the drones could do the task without any human direction.)\n\nReading about the tick-killing bot inspires the idea.\n\nhttp://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/tech/science/environment/2015/06/19/robot-kill-ticks-yard/28875879/\n\nI haven't found much in my online searches for development of these types of drone uses.

        "text": "Everyone that uses a computer in their day to day life has the ability to slightly change their experience in order to use some of their time and resources to raise money for charity. There are several services that are designed in a way that creates revenue; the money is then donated to charities across the world. I'll go through some of the resouces I've found, but write a comment if you know any similar services. The services are listed in their order of impact.\n\n[Ecosia](https://info.ecosia.org/what): Ecosia is a search engine built off of Bing and other existing services. The search engine will then display ads at the top of the search, like Google and Bing already do, and the money gained from clicking these ads goes to several reforestry projects across the world. Generally whenever I see the ads, I'll open them in a new tab and then quickly close them when I found the website I'm actually looking for. In [August 2017](http://documents.ecosia.org/369415/12019080), they raised almost $460,000 for reforestry projects around the world!\n\n[Tab For a Cause](http://tab.gladly.io/): This service changes your tabbing experience so that when you open a new tab, two ads are placed in the bottom right half of your screen. Every tab generates hearts, which then allows you to decide where the ad revenue goes. You are also able to made additions to the page, create bookmarks tiles, and add widgets to the new tab page. \n\n[Smile Always](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/smile-always/jgpmhnmjbhgkhpbgelalfpplebgfjmbf): Smile Always is a cool program that automatically transfers you to smile.amazon which donates 1% of goods purchased to a charity. Pretty simply and easy application for those of you that use Amazon frequently. ",
