        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nlong story short: I want to make a startup and there's an idea, but not more than that.  \nSo: Let's see if you guys think the idea is actually useful and there should be time spent on it, or not.  \n\n\nWhen researching about statistics on software engineering, it was quite crazy to see that many engineers report on having burnout-similar symptoms and most report working on projects with high technical debt (not surprised tbh). Many also report having problems collaborating with their colleagues.  \n\n\nThis has lead me to a idea, that is B2B focussed, but made for people like us: Something like a \"developer assistant\". I don't mean \"ChatGPT with some pre-made prompts\", but instead a dashboard (PWA) that is persoanlized for every developer, showing:\n\n* Personalized feedback on the things that happened. (*\"Deployment went well? Good!\" or \"Approved reviews that lead to Sentry reports? Not good, look into it.\"*)\n* Help with finding focus for the most pressing work (*Story x is due in 4 days but the branch is stale and you didn't report being blocked there/referring a story that's blocking you*).\n* Gamification that doesn't just look at written lines of code and also points out your biggest strength and contribution type *(\"You reduce lines of code without bug reports or worse performance, removing code smells? &gt; You're obviously a clean coder!\" or \"You write documentation in Doxygen/OpenAPI without contributing too much to the code, but the respective project is voted on as being good documented? You're a documenter!\"*).\n   * This could also be used to improve the setup of engineering teams (combining generalists with certain other types).  \n\n\n**Now the real question: While this is all just a early thought, does it sound like something that would bring you a benefit and you would like to use?**  \n\n\n I expect people in bigger corporations to mostly profiting by that. At my employer, people simply don't look at the tons of jira dashboards...\n\nThank you all :)",

        "text": "I've been doing software engineering for about 6 years now.  Self-taught, app developer, and always enjoyed the hobby of it.  I was fortunate enough to turn an app I built into a small business, and managed to be acquired for a great profit.  It was rewarding to build for customers, to bring joy to users and businesses that used it, and to get a crash-course in running a business.\n\nI managed to take a few years off, and in figuring out what the future looked like, I got a job as a software engineer at a large company (not a FAANG, but major company; our app does several billion in revenue and has 10m+ active users).  I'm on a small team of engineerings I like and have a good amount of clout.  I wasn't the most disciplined engineer when I joined, but I learned a lot.\n\nMy challenge is that I really struggle with caring about \"engineering.\"  Things like architecture really don't interest me.  I respect them - I like clean, organized code.  I'm definitely the strongest proponent of good documentation, of writing extensive tests, and trying to simplify thought processes while adopting the latest tech.  But I really don't enjoy the arguments around, what I see it is, \"where files should go.\"\n\nWe build our software as a lot of decoupled components.  Today, we spent three hours discussing where one service could live, and in the end, I disassociated.  I sat back and thought, \"We have a backlog of 400 bugs.  We haven't released a new feature in this app in 18 months.  Where this service goes doesn't impact the end user.  It truthfully doesn't actually matter.\"\n\nI'm struggling with this part of it.  I just don't *care* about these deep discussions around things like architecture.  It's good practice to worry about access control, but in the end, if I mark something as public vs. private, it doesn't matter.  We don't build open source software.  We don't build for anyone but us.\n\nDoes anyone else get into these mindsets?  Struggling with wanting to build great software, impact a business, impact humanity, and not care about things like architecture patterns?",

I know this may send a little bit weird but my manager called in sick last minute and I was delegated by the CEO to replace him in our tech consultancy call tmrw (with 3rd parties) and I just got notified a couple of hours so I didn't had enough time to prepare. So, I was wondering if anyone has like generic questions that I can ask tomorrow in the meeting. Also, I'm trying to impress the CEO so he can consider me as my manager replacement as my manager is very underperforming lately. \n\nOur tech stack is \n\nBE: Django + Postgres + Redis + Celery (scheduler)\n\nFE: React\n\nI've this kind-of-generic questions that I've prepared to ask them tmrw and they may be related to our company architecture/code base. \n\n1- Is the current backend stack future-proof in terms of scalability and reliability? Also, wouldn't it be better if we switched to Node/Go to save up on the infra costs. \n\n2- If we switched the codebase, is it better to roll out in a microservice fashion where new services gets written in the new stack and overtime we breakdown the monolithic app into small microservices \n\n3- Some database performance questions (query-related so I can't share them publicly)\n\n4- SSR vs No-SSR for our SPA \n\nI'd heavily appreciate if any of you guys helped by like pointing some blind spots in the tech that I should ask them about it. I didn't prepare well as I was called on a super short notice and I had a lot of work to finish so I didn't get enough time.",

        "text": "One way to deal with software requirements is to informally speak on the phone, or add informal notes in an Agile backlog. The best way is however to do a proper requirements engineering which is a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable process for producing software requirements, such as an Agile backlog with epics, stories, features or a formal software requirements specification document. Nailing this stage can make all subsequent software engineering more productive. \n\nRequirements engineering is a process which can be better understood by artificially dividing it in 4 stages: requirements elicitation, requirements analysis, requirements specification, requirements validation. In practice, these stages are often intertwined and may be done in parallel, or jump between different steps. Further, in practice requirements are engineered iteratively starting with high-level terms and then subsequently decomposing them into increasingly more detailed in each iteration.\n\nOverall, I figured that to engineer requirements systematically means we need a system (input, process, output) which promises to produce the outputs we want, given we provide certain inputs into the system. The system should already exist (a well-known engineering approach). It should promise to produce an Agile backlog with epics, stories, features or an SRS document.\n\nTo illustrate the importance of this stage, for example, requirements can be modular which leads to a modular software rather than monolithic, and modules encapsulate similar requirements together so that you can understand the software system at different levels of abstraction, from the most high-level (the purpose, which is to solve some business problem or some engineering problem) through individual business domains or engineering domains (i.e. order management, payment management, user account management, etc.).\n\nIn my experience, this is the most neglected area in practice and it is theoretically where the biggest gain can be achieved with the least effort. Can you share some specific well-defined process (Agile or predictive) which is the best practice for requirements elicitation, analysis, specification, validation?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/11ki4ou/nyc_teacher_looking_to_switch_to_software/",
        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm currently a science teacher in NYC, teaching public school and making around 78k per year (49k after tax) with two master's degrees. I'm looking for advice from people who are familiar with software engineering or just making a career switch to a higher paying field. \n\nI also don't know if it is too late to switch to software engineering now given my age and the fact that I have zero experiences with computer science or coding. I've heard of discrimination against older folks in tech so I'm slightly worried about that in the future. \n\nTo be very honest, my biggest reason for making the career switch is the money factor. I know there will be a lot of NAY-sayers here telling me to go with the passion or what makes me happy over the money. When I was 24-ish, I sort of took the \"easy path\" and became a teacher instead of applying to med school because I thought that studying 12 hours a day in med school would make me unhappy and that I wasn't super passionate about medicine. Now that I have more years of work experiences I realized how bad of a mistake it was. But I'm not gonna go back to the pre-med route because frankly it will take WAY too many years to become an attending. Thought about other paths like nurse anesthetist  but also similar number of years of schooling required.\n\nI don't know if software engineering is my passion but the idea of working for BIG Tech and being at the frontier of tech is appealing to me. I like problem solving but I am also worried about what if I can't solve this problem/cant figure it out- will I get fired if I do it too often? \n\nI've recently started with the very basic (watching khan academy videos on Javascript and reading a book on Python). It seems like learning the language itself in these two easy languages is okay but software ENGINEERING will def involve more critical thinking right? Started two lectures of Harvard CS 50 but found the second lecture of C to be a bit confusing to me so I went to khan academy to learn some very basic coding first. \n\nMy first masters is in biology, second masters is in education. I've been teaching for 4 years and haven't been in school for a long time. I haven't taken a math course since 2013 so I'm slightly worried about getting a MS in comp science because what if I'm actually super dumb and fail all the exams haha. But I was definitely a math/logic oriented person in HS - did all the way up to multivariable calculus in HS (Forgot everything for sure tho!)but went the pre-med route in college and mostly took biology classes with no math. \n\nAs I mention earlier before, one of the reasons I wanted to switch career is because I want to make more. In the long run, ideally I would like to make 200-300k per year if possible. But if not, then whatever. Right now I'm barely making 80k as a teacher. I'm working everyday at after school and on both Saturdays and Sunday as a tutor as well as the summer. Basically working 7 days a week. And even with that, I don't think I'm barely hitting 100k with all my side jobs/hustles. With my afterschool and tutoring jobs, it always feel to me that I'm just selling my time/youth for the VERY little money that I'm paid. And it doesn't feel good. The tutoring hours are random sometimes- randomly got cut hours by my boss last minute. And I don't think I will even hit 100k this year with all the side things that I do/working 7 days a week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I do enjoy some aspects of teaching (positive relationships with some kids), I also felt like I haven't learned much in the past four years of teaching. I've learned certain things within teaching but it isnt super transferrable to other jobs. And also! Besides the salary freeze, admins are also going a bit crazy! At my school we get evaluated every 2 weeks or so! Just got one today unexpectedly and probably didn't go too well. I'm not miserable as a teacher but for most of the days, I just cant wait until the next vacation! Seem like the days off are the main things that make me happy at the job! I don't get much respects from some students, parents or admins (when they are in a bad mood- somewhat unpredictable sometimes!)\n\nAnd I was secretly envious of my friends who are doing data science or other cool jobs that seem to keep them learning more about important skills/being at the frontier of cutting edge tech. \n\nAnyway, thank you for reading my long post. \n\nI was thinking about doing the NYU Tandon Bridge program maybe starting this summer and if I get a B+ overall then maybe I will apply to the NYU Tandon CS program? There is also a Mayor Graduate Scholarship Program for city employees and it was the reason I consider this program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thoughts? Should I do it or not do it? One of my friends who is a SWE said it is very competitive to get a first job as a SWE so he wouldn't advise doing it solely for the $. He got a CS masters and worked 2 years at a minimum wage internship program before landing his current six-fig job. Another friend who is also a SWE now (he was a comp science dropout but somehow made it back to CS) he is now working for a startup at NYC. He is making 6 fig now but he said there are weeks of him working 7 days a week and he pulled so many all nighter.I'm cool with working 7 days a week sometimes or pulling all nighter occasionally but would like to limit that because it is not sustainable for my long term physical or mental health. One other teacher friend said to NOT switch because SWE will be replaced my AI in the future and he told me to just go with nursing but.....like I said, in the long run I am aiming for a higher salary (hopefully in the 200-300K or more ) and that seems to be more feasible in tech. I know some nurses make a lot too but that may also takes a lot of schooling/exp? Idk. But tech as a field seems so much cooler to me even tho I dont know too much about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice from people who are working in tech/SWE and those who made the change would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading my post. Sorry if I'm naive about the compensation part or if I am aiming too high when I say I want to make 200k lol ! (just wanted to be honest with my actual long term goal tho). And hey its the internet - who cares if you judge me haha.",

I’m considering publishing the apps using three delivery models.\n\nI am thinking:\n\n1.

I’m thinking these people would just serve as a catalyst to spread awareness of the apps.  \n\n2. I will allow anybody to download the software (option 1 above) and purchase a support account if they so desire. I envision these installs as smaller companies who probably have their own IT folk but see the value in having vendor support.  \n \n3. I will offer the software as a fully managed SaaS product. This is how I provide it to my current clients, and this is a popular option.\n\nBasically, I feel the apps are a useful suite of tools and would like to share it with the world, to see how popular it could become and hopefully increase my revenues at the same time. It would be free, but not opensource. \n\nMy concern is, the less than honorable among us will hack and crack the software to the point where its reputation will be damaged. I would not require a license for the software (it would be truly free), so there will really be no incentive for hackers. Hopefully, I could find some clients in category 2 and 3 (above) that would find value in the software and engage as a paying client.\n\nHas anyone published software in this way and what was your experience? Do you think I’m naive to think I would pickup clients this way? Also, are their any feature you can think of, or recommend, that I should engineer into the software to protect its integrity. It currently do the basic things like password encryption, brute-force detection (and IP lock-out), captcha, Geo blacklisting, runtime error notifications, SQL injection and XSS.",

        "text": " Hey there,\n\nI don't know why I am posting this, but I guess it's because I want to get this out of my head and maybe find out if others are seeing themselves in a similar manner. It’s neither a rant nor a mental issue nor a midlife crisis (lol), I feel I just wanted to share this to hear other people’s thoughts.\n\nI started out as a designer more than 12 years ago and got into development about 4 or 5 years ago, built some websites, went freelance, earned good money, and built a few software products. About 1.5 years ago I got a decent job offer from a US start-up which resulted in earning a great salary. I am working remotely from Europe and actually love my job. On the side, I am running a small SaaS business with a friend of mine (we're making a few k MRR) working on this is the best part of my week.\n\nI consider myself to be a *good* developer (my title is \"Engineer\"), however, I feel I am slowly reaching my zenith. Our team is very small and while some colleagues are „worse\" (please note, everyone has different strengths and talents, so saying they're \"worse\" is not about being competitive or myself feeling superior) we have a few that are soooo much better than me. A strength of mine has always been to draw a very clear and realistic picture of myself, without being unnecessarily pessimistic — e.g. I consider myself to be average intelligent in terms of \"grasping a concept\", but I have other strengths. This resonates a lot with the issues at work being assigned to your team, you get a clear picture of what you're capable of and the more \"hardcore\" engineering stuff always gets assigned to the better devs I talked about (while there are way simpler tickets who get designed to others as well).\n\nThe focus for this year was to learn another language and I wanted to get really good with TypeScript and Ruby/Rails (what we're using at my company) and learn maybe Rust or something very classic to expand my knowledge — to step up my \"engineering career\". Experimenting with new stuff excites me hence why I switched to NeoVim about 2 years ago. I also enjoy going the \\_hard way\\_ to get better at certain stuff. Also, I find AWS (serverless, SST, DynamoDB, ...) extremely exciting. I just mentioned this to tell you that I am not \\_lazy\\_ or don’t care about learning new stuff. But... The more I think about it, the more I realize that everything from design to development is a means to an end. What I really enjoy is building software products for people to use, I enjoy wearing more hats, being in charge of how it looks and how it feels, talking to customers, doing customer support, and taking care of finances. I see these people on Twitter, Twitch, or YouTube who can build a framework on their own, create an auth-package (e.g. \\`next-auth\\`) or write a complex Vim plugin in 7 minutes and 34 seconds during a live stream and this whole scenario seems so far from my world. I don't even feel like an impostor, I just don't feel I belong to the world of „real engineers“ because I am not good enough. In January I turned 39 so catching up with those people who have a decade or more of background knowledge under their belt seems impossible. Maybe I could make a real impact at a company starting and building an MVP as quickly as possible where code quality is important but you don't need the talent to improve the speed of a query from 0.5s to 0.3s.\n\nThat's it, I guess. Don't know what to expect from this post, but I guess it was good to write it down and share my feelings. If not only for myself it might help someone else because they find themselves in the same boat.",

        "text": " Hi, hopefully someone on here with experience can point me in the right direction.\n\nI have no professional experience in programming and am self-taught, and everything I have built up to this point was for myself or a few close friends. It goes without saying that I have always winged it structure wise, but this time I want to roll out a desktop app with a monthly subscription fee and I want to structure it right, business wise and programming wise. It goes without saying that my idea isn't going to revolutionize anything but I built it for myself because it does not exist, and I know other stock market participants will want it. As far as fee goes, it will be extremely low, I just want to offset the cost of API stock data which does not come cheap.\n\nUsually to control user access to my apps, I use a wordpress member signup page so users register and are stored in a mySQL table, and I manually grant access by changing a boolean in a column. So the desktop checks if the user exist, validates encrypted password stored by wordpress (found the java library somewhere) and then opens the rest of the app if everything checks out. I also incorporate a kill switch in the table so on app launch, it validates that the app should be live and opens or not, then the user can login.\n\nThis time around I plan on having a lot of users, but I don't want to go the license key way and I want to make it easy for the customer by using something like WooCommerce to handle the recurring membership/payment side of things, and I was wondering what are the usual best practices for this sort of enterprise.\n\nI created a server/web app in Node.js to handle API calls (I pay for the data and have commercial use) and data handling/writing to my database, and a C# desktop app for the clients that queries my Node.js app to retrieve information. Finally I am building a simple wordpress website to handle user signup and subscription, with a link to download the .exe file.I have a couple questions on how to roll this out and what are common best practices in the industry. I don't have a team and am an amateur and I want to keep things as simple as possible for now. I really won't have to market that much to get a user base either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Where should I host my Node.js app that isn't expensive. (I thought about heroku but I am not sure if it will be allowed since I will have customers)\n2. What is best practice when handling user subscriptions (With or without license key..). The license key route is really bumming me out for some reason..\n3. I am clueless about terms of use and application signing. SHould I worry about this right now or continue winging it? After all, I doubt I will have more than a few hundred users.\n4. If possible I don't want my app on Microsoft store or the likes, I want to keep it in house, but is handling all the customer side, downloads, service etc a smart move?\n\nAny pointers will be greatly appreciated, and again, if this isn't the right place to ask, I am sorry. I am overwhelmed by the amount of work this took and how much I had to learn by myself not being a coder by trade, but I am fairly close to having a working beta and I want to do things right!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks to anyone that takes the time to read/respond.",

While it is easy to identify software that is of low quality, identifying software that is of high quality can be challenging. Therefore, improving software quality across an organization is a significant undertaking that involves defining what constitutes quality, identifying the root causes of low quality, and implementing organization-wide improvements in processes and tools to measure and ensure quality.\n\nI am interested in hearing success stories of organizations that have effectively improved software quality.

It's a lightweight API gateway service written in Go that makes it easy to manage and route API requests to the right backend services.\n\nWith Frontman, you can easily set up routing rules, add custom headers, and perform URL rewrites. It's perfect for small to medium-sized projects and can be easily integrated into your existing tech stack. Plus, it's open-source and free to use!\n\nWhile Frontman is still in development and doesn't have all the features yet, it's designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to customize it to your needs. Currently, Frontman doesn't support authentication, but it's in the works and will be added in a future release.\n\nAs a one-person team, I've put a lot of effort into making Frontman lightweight, fast, and easy to use. I hope you find it useful, and I welcome any feedback or contributions you might have.\n\nCheck out the Frontman GitHub page[https://github.com/hyperioxx/frontman](https://github.com/hyperioxx/frontman) to learn more and give it a try.\n\nThanks for your time and happy coding!",

At these income brackets almost 50% of your salary is deducted from your gross in taxes, and on top of that we don't even get the respect of being called an engineer because legally the term is protected and you are considered a \"Software Developer\". Often times, you are lumped in with the IT department of your company.  And before you say, \"Oh but what about cost of living?\" Our medical system is broken and you can't find a family doctor here in Canada.

The agency has dropped the ball in many areas so I don't trust their opinion at this point and I'm looking to get a how-to guide from people in this community.\n\nThe app requires the microservice architecture. The app's hosting must be a fixed, predictable monthly price. Hence, I refuse to use AWS lambda. I'm relying on Linode: [https://www.linode.com/pricing/#compute-dedicated](https://www.linode.com/pricing/#compute-dedicated)\n\nHere are my questions:\n\nA) Does implementing microservices require load balancing? \n\nB) If it's not a requirement, is load balancing typically a good pairing with the microservices architecture?  How is load balancing done if we double the current fixed price, hosting plan?\n\nC) Is microservices an independent concept from hosting? Meaning, can't microservices be implemented on a fixed price, dedicated CPU hosting plan? When I brought up microservices, the agency wanted to push the project to AWS lambda but as I said I cannot have an unpredictable monthly hosting cost. I need a fixed price service. I shared links with them about  implementing microservices via Linode and those pages talked about Kubernetes/Docker. The agency told me these solutions are dynamic pricing/not predictable pricing. PS. Please, don't suggest a pricing \"threshold\" I can set. I don't want that. (I want one fixed price I need to pay for hosting.)  \n\nD) Based on the above, how would one implement microservices via a fixed price, dedicated CPU hosting plan? How does load balancing fit in?",

        "text": "Hi All,\n\nI am a recent career-changer into software development. Early thirties, and recent graduate of a post-bacc program for C.S.\n\nI'm working at a job that I really enjoy right now, but for about 66% of my market value. (It's a \"startup\"). And in a town that I don't enjoy to-boot. There is a lot more to unpack here, but I could write a small novel on this weird situation I am in. I want to learn about and explore other opportunites.\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nTo keep it short, I am this startup's sole software developer, and I'm right out of school. I'm helping build two core products. I've been learning A LOT just by building a codebase by myself. I've been aggressively refactoring as it expands, and I recognize problems. I'm very proud of what I have built. I also recognize the golden-egg I have of everything being \"greenfield\". I have autonomy, reasonable deadlines, am building something of my own, and don't have anyone to answer to. It's truly a job that naive young devs dream about, where they build a passion project rather than being a cog in a wheel and grind it out at a large firm. Love the work itself.\n\nThe cons however are that I'm their only dev, and the product(s) I am building are really just shit-tons of scripting in Python. It's a lot of data processing, transformation, and writing it to a new output format. It's in the 3D printing space, so dealing with making print files for 3D parts. It's very cool and I enjoy it. Safe to say, I'm only advancing my technical skills in learning how to properly modulate a codebase and build very clean and tidy code. And learning the value of full coverage automated unit testing :)  Otherwise, I'm probably not growing my technical skills as quickly or as broadly as my peers at other companies.\n\n**What I'm looking for**\n\n**I'm looking for yall's insight into different jobs I may be able to get, what they entail, and the tradeoffs between them.**\n\n1. Dev Ops\n2. Software Engineer\n3. Data Engineer\n4. (?) Embedded systems\n5. Other ?\n\nCan anyone provide insight on what each of these may entail, and pros/cons?\n\nData engineering has always piqued my interest, but my uninformed concern has been that I may be stuck in data engineering for my whole career and lose out in technical growth in true software development, or the opportunity to transition into a software dev role.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany thanks,\n\nscott\\_sleepy",

They want someone with a software engineering degree (makes perfect sense) so I recently applied to pursue a second bachelor’s of science in software engineering. \n\nIs this a mistake??? I feel like this field is so competitive and I need this degree to do what I want to do. But everyone is telling me to avoid the school debt and stick to what I’m doing now.",
