        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/riddles/comments/yozr0m/frog_scorpion_fable_whos_fault_is_it_curious_what/",
        "text": "So I saw this short clip recently and read this commentary online about it - I pasted it below.  \nI'd like to know all your thoughts as to who's fault or who is to blame for the FROG'S death (i.e., either frog or scorpion).  I don't fully agree with this person's commentary that he said the Scorpion's actions were at fault. I don't want to influence anyone's decision, but I just want to briefly say my perspective that it's the nature of the scorpion to sting (for survival) and the frog knowing this still decided to take this 'risk' so my opinion is that it's the frog's fault for the poor/risky decision knowing the nature of the scorpion is to sting  - can you get angry at your dog for making noise barking at a time when you don't want the dog to bark? It's the nature of the dog to bark...  \n=======================================================  \n**The scorpion and the frog: a not-so-moral moral**  \nMost of us are familiar with the parable of the scorpion and the frog, in which the frog's charity and kindness is repaid with cruelty by the scorpion. For those that aren’t, let me recount it for you. A scorpion asks a frog to carry it across a river. The frog hesitates, afraid of being stung, but the scorpion argues that if it did so, they would both drown. Considering this, the frog agrees, but midway across the river the scorpion does indeed sting the frog, dooming them both.  \nWhen the frog asks the scorpion why, the scorpion replies that it was in its nature to do so. “Just my nature, frog.”  \nThe moral of the story — the frog should have been aware of the scorpion's nature, and so we should always be aware of the true nature of those who surround us.  \nI've been thinking about that story a lot lately. How absolutely twisted is the lesson it imparts? So those who are good-hearted are at fault for trusting, for showing compassion, for loving? While the evil and morally ambiguous are excused? It's just their nature?  \nIs that the society we want? Is that the society we've created? Jaded and cruel? One in which we're all just potential marks and saps? Just our nature. Hmmm. Do we truly want to live in a society and world that punishes the innocence of the frog over the mendacity and guile of the scorpion? And let’s circle back to a central point of the story, the dueling natures of the two animals, particularly the simple-minded naiveté of the frog.  Naiveté or faith? Faith in the ability of one to redeem himself? Faith in the human spirit? Faith in a brotherhood that bonds us all? Consider this, the frog knew the scorpion was likely to sting him and still chose to carry him. Why? Because he wanted to give the scorpion an opportunity to redeem himself or to prove his self-worth or...he simply didn't want to pre-judge an individual, for how can we condemn someone for an action he has yet to commit?  \nI contend that we're looking at this parable from the wrong angle. It isn't the frog that is at fault here. He did what he is supposed to do — help someone in need. It's the scorpion's actions that need to be evaluated. He struck the frog, even though it killed him in the process. So, perhaps, the moral of the story should be — always fight your baser instincts, your selfishness, your greed, your self-destructive inner impulse, or what have you, because it not only hurts others but yourself as well.",
