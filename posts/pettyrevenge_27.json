        "text": "One of my first workplaces had extremely toxic management - it was owned and run by an old couple in their 60s were \"co-CEOs\". The wife in particular was a bitter, racist asshole who would micromanage everyone, take credit for our work and also hated my guts more than the rest of the team (I am minority, female, young and also opinionated i.e. all the things she despises).\n\nBecause she's quite old, she never learned to touch type and instead does the typical hunt-and-peck style, so once she starts typing she stares down at her keyboard the entire time. She also tends to write quite long emails.\n\nI became so jaded that any form of revenge was screwing with her to brighten my day, so one time I decided to plug a wireless dongle for a mouse into her PC. Once I saw she was typing, I'd wait until she'd typed a reasonable amount and then click using the spare mouse somewhere random. She'd continue typing, look up, and rage at her computer and have to start again. Sometimes I'd repeat the process within the same email for extra fuckery.\n\nMy colleagues were in on it, so I'd give them a heads-up when I clicked so we could all have a laugh.\n\nWhen I was done, I'd simply wait until she left and casually unplug the dongle from her PC. Honestly this is one of the things that kept me sane while I was there until I managed to escape.\n\nFind joy in the little things :')",

        "text": "This is a story told to me by my boss. His son, Fred, played on a travel baseball team in the late 1990s. One teammate, we'll call him Orville, wasn't playing at all. Regardless if it was the games were close or the outcome was determined, Orville didn't get to play. The sad part which made it more frustrating is Fred and Orville had only ten players on their team. This will be crucial for later.  \n\n\nOrville told his dad that he was quitting because of the lack of playing time. His dad shared the same frustration. However, he had a plan. Fred was aware of the plan as well, so he wouldn't get caught off guard.   \n\n\nFast forward three games later, and Orville is still riding the pine. Fred is playing at 3rd Base and gets hit by a line drive before he can react. Fred takes a brutal hit to the shoulder, taking him out of the game. The coach looks to Orville and tells him to get his glove. This makes Orville the 9th player on the team. Without nine players, the team has to forfeit. Orville looked up at his dad in the stands &amp; asked, \"Now?\" \"Yes, right now!!\" said his dad with a smile.  \n\n\nOrville gets the rest of his gear, walks up to the coach, and says, \"I quit.\" Fred laughs because he knows what is happening. The team is left with eight players, meaning they must forfeit the game for having few players. It's petty and not a pro-revenge, only because it was not a championship game.",

        "text": "\nSo this has been a thing for a while. My FIL who lives with us is a hard man to get along with. Feel free to see my other posts. \n\nAnyways when we moved in together just before the birth of mine and BF's son. After my son was born my FIL decided he was going to start pestering me every month about my lady-plugs. \nNext to the toilet is a small open circular trash can. I've always wrapped my plugs with toilet paper and covered them with a few sheets more if need be. However FIL would say I was leaving my plugs for all to see. He'd start arguments, he'd purposely bring it up in front of people to embarrass me. \nFinally I got tired of the insults and fighting so I had my BF buy a small trash can with a lid. Now this one is rectangular and literally just barely too big to fit next to the toilet so we had to put it on the other side of the sink. FIL's trash can is still in it's spot too. Now when my trash can sits properly i can just barely reach it from the toilet, however FIL rotates it 90° to where I can't reach it. He says he can't get the door to the bathroom to open enough for his fat ass when it sits properly. The swing radius hits the corner of the sink before my trash can so it literally has no effect on how much room there is to get in the bathroom. Anyways I told my BF that the plug thing is literally just him looking for excuses to humiliate me, not because he could actually see my plugs in the trash. How do we know this? Well since getting my trash can I stopped wrapping my plugs entirely ON PURPOSE (unless company is coming over) because the lid covers them. Well, FIL uses my trash can more than his own and doesn't complain about seeing my plugs that are now blatantly showing if you open the lid....\nSo now his power play is rotating the trash can out of my reach so I now have to remember to move it each time before i sit on the pot.",

So we made a point of interest on google maps called “Shortcut to Davis Ranch” to stir the pot even more.\n\n[Here](https://ShortcuttoDavisRanchhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/mQGhnDi5jdkiu47L8?g_st=ic) is a link to it if you want to see how petty my entire neighborhood is :)\n\nI live in a (non-gated) neighborhood that previously had ONE road both in and out. My neighborhood also has two schools on this ONE road. The traffic is ridiculous during rush hour or when schools get in/out.\n\nThere has ALWAS been a public works plan to build a secondary exit from my neighborhood. It just so happens to connect to the main road by going through a portion of a (also non-gated) wealthier neighborhood behind us.\n\nFast-forward… the public roadway gets built as planned. And as expected, people in my neighborhood start using is to avoid the traffic on the other, busier road. Legit shaves 15-20 min off any commute or drive.\n\nThe people in this neighborhood have began posting to theirs (and our) FB page with the most ridiculous things and have gone to protest to their city council. Some examples to give y’all an idea: “They are ruining our lives by driving through daily.” “This road has derailed mine and my wife’s life plans.” They are currently attempting to petition the city to rule the road “emergency use only” and are also filing a lawsuit against the city (supposedly). They have several folks who will legit take photos of cars driving through, and will count how many cars per day drive through.\n\nThey’ve also tried to send my neighborhood HOA bills for the road. Which, mind you - is a 100% PUBLIC ROAD that they did not even pay for.\n\nThe latest thing is that they are saying this road is a “gift” from them. Overall they’re just pretentious folks tbh. Idk why they think they’re somehow entitled to anything. I’m not an asshole - I totally get how this could be annoying for them. But they have generalized my entire neighborhood as public enemy #1 and tbh I just think it’s hilarious. SO we made a point of interest on google maps called “Shortcut to Davis Ranch” and have been reviewing it 5 stars with the most hilarious comments. (The goal being that anytime they look at their maps they see this mention of the road they despise so much).",

        "text": "So a follow up to our petty revenge on knocking the price down an additional 10k on our house because they were being obnoxious. \n\nSo the street behind our new house is a mobile home park. When we looked at the pictures on Zillow the area behind our house was covered in grass and a few trees. However when we got to the site to do a house viewing it was completely cleared and flattened with a mobile home sitting on wheels. We were curious but hey, property lines were clearly marked and nothing had crossed it so whatever’s. \n\nFast forward to about 2 months later different sets of mobile homes have been stored there temporarily. I finally saw them as they were moving the homes and figured I would pop down to say high. \n\nGreat dude who owns about 4 mobile home parks in the area. We bonded over how much of a bitch the previous owner was(To give you an example, I asked if she knew anything about the wiring they never finished doing and her response was “electricians are paid enough to figure it out”. Bitch I’m the one paying). Anyway he gave me the run down on what happened. \n\nSo he lets her know that planned to put a mobile home on the lot behind her house, however she starts cussing at him talking about her bird watching. He warns her that this could be a nice neighbor situation, or a shitty neighbor situation:her call. She didn’t get the hint and called the city to try. City calls him and says “you can’t put one in while meeting easement requirements” he responds “my tape measure says otherwise”(and he was right). \n\nSo after this he spends his next weekend just completely removing everything up to the property line with his excavator(which is why it was marked for our viewing) and leaves it as a flat dirt park before he starts using it as damaged mobile home storage to add salt the wound.\n\nShe puts the house up for sale the next week. \n\nAs I said, a great guy overall and had no problem talking about what his plans are(even apologized for how the houses looked and said he was gonna put new siding on so everything looked nice). He also said next year they are going to replant a bunch of stuff to prevent erosion so I got nothing to worry about there. \n\nI said it’s all cool, I just needed to know what was going there so I could make sure my fence was high enough to pee off my deck in peace. \n\nTLDR: Lady was a bitch telling him how to use his property, dude spends a weekend ruining her view, I get good deal on house.",

        "text": "Around late 2016/early 2017 I had returned home to the South of England from University to stay with my parents while I figured out what on earth I was going to do with my life. I worked a crap retail job (while surrounded by lovely people) for a few months to clear my student overdraft which I so willingly maxed out at Uni. I really wanted out and to find a job where I would start an actual career. \n\nIn steps one particularly nasty sales (potentially MLM scam) group that rhymes with 'bero corp' who advertised a 'Marketing' role online which I eagerly applied for. Within a day or two I received a response and an interview invitation for their office in central London (which total travel time for me was roughly an hour and ten/fifteen minutes or so). I was pretty hyped.\n\nCatching the train into Waterloo I was excited at the potential of getting this first career-making role and spent the entire train journey, tube ride, and walk through central London excited what life could be like in a few months/years. \n\nTheir office was in a beautiful green area of London which only bolstered my optimism, but then I reached the office itself. \n\nI'd like you to imagine you've gone to a walk-in gp and stood in the waiting room it's really fucking busy, you're struggling to find a single empty chair. It's that situation except there are (possibly 60/70 ... It's been a long time so my memory may be exaggerating this number) people all in interview outfits ranging from suits to jeans and a 8 months in a closet pile creased white shirts. \n\nI don't question it too much as I think the job sounded great and I just want to impress the interviewer. \n\nI get called into this man's office, he seems nice enough but has a really slimy air about him. He starts saying the most amazing things about the role and the company. How I'd be earning about 36k in two years, how I'd be working as a manager soon because 'its just so easy to progress here.' In my desperation to start my career I ate it all up. I left that interview feeling pretty good about myself and headed home. \n\nWithin an hour on my journey home I get an email from a woman inviting me for an interview.. a first interview. I responded a bit confused as I had just had my first interview and her response was essentially 'oh well, why don't you come in for your second interview tomorrow then.' an interview starting at 8/9am. Her willingness to offer me a second interview seemingly without any knowledge of my first chat with the manager concerned me.. but again.. I hated retail so I was all in. \n\nI rocked up again the next day, surprised to see that the front room is full once more with a variety of applicants and I'm getting increasingly uncomfortable by the minute.\n\nOnce again smarmy manager invites me into his office and I explain to him that I was under the assumption that this was an office job. \"Oh yeah it absolutely is, but there's the occasional bit of outside work you have to complete here.\"\nHe then introduces me to someone a few years older than me, young Indian guy in his mid twenties all dressed up. \n\nThe manager explained to me that I'd be spending some time with this 'marketer' to prove my worth to the company. \n\nThe next thing he said.. \"I'll see you tonight.\"\n\n- \"Tonight?\"\n\n\"I'll see you when you guys get back about 8:30/9ish, and then we can talk about how you've performed today.\"\n\nI'm a bit shell shocked by this.. because it's about 9:30 in the fucking morning and I'm expected to spend 11 hours with this stranger as part of this very shifty job interview. \n\nIn my somewhat confused state I blindly follow this also very slimy individual as he's lecturing me on sales. And leading me to the London underground, he tells me we're catching the tube somewhere further down the line in zone 1 or 2. Of course, he expects me to pay my own ticket because fuck me right. \n\nI ask him about the plan for the day and he tells me all about how he'll be assessing my sales technique on the street and how I need to prove I 'have what it takes to be a hero'.\n\nWhile this guy is lecturing me and telling me all about how he was going to be a doctor but leaving med school to work at this company was the greatest thing he ever did I'm sat there realising (which I should have realised way way sooner) that all this fucking awful company is doing is speeding people through their conveyor belt 'application process' to get a whole day of free labour from them where they'll be expected to spend 10/11 hours marketing bullshit products on the streets. \n\nI'm seething. I'm mad at myself for buying into this ridiculous facade, I'm mad at the manager for filling my head with absolute nonsense for the past two days and I'm mad at this smug prick who's rudely lecturing me on the tube about marketing. \n\nTo fill our journey he's telling me to pull out my notepad and start listing the 'most important aspects of sales', lecturing me on how he's my 'boss for today' that if he says jump I need to say how high, he also occasionally arrogantly reminds me that if I don't impress him at any point today the manager is sure to hear about it tonight.\n\nI'm a pretty passive person, pretty agreeable and at least in the past, would have gone quite far along with situations I disliked/to avoid awkwardness, but at this point there's no fucking way I'm doing anything for these people, let alone attempting to sell a shitty product for them for 11 hours. \n\nMy eyes must have glazed over while he was talking and we reached a stop because he showed clear agitation and raised his voice a bit at me for not hanging on his every word. \n\nSeeing the tube doors shut I decided what I was going to do. I engaged really heavily with him, I acted so invested in everything he was saying for the next two/three minutes and the moment those doors opened again..\n\nI scripted this scene in my head, like I had seen someone from my past outside that I hadn't seen in many years. I stood up and dramatically said \"Is that...?\"\n\nWas almost a doctor: \"What are you doing?! Sit down.\" \n\nMe: \"Wait.. is that...?\"\n\nThen I just got up and off the fucking tube hearing him shouting \"get back here!\" from his seat. \n\nI spent the rest of the day walking around London questioning my life decisions. The manager emailed me asking what happened and I told him that the smarmy train guy had lost me on the tube. \n\nNaturally I received another email asking me to go attend a first interview.",

        "text": "Not a recent story, but I felt like sharing. \n\n**Background:**  \nMy sophomore year of college I took a Horror Lit class with a friend who was a senior. The professor for said class was notorious for his Stereotypical Asshole English Professor ^(TM) attitude and ridiculous grading curve. He had a participation policy for his lower level courses, which this was. Students got a minus for not showing up at all, a check minus for making eye contact with the professor, a check for saying something, and a check plus for contributing to the conversation in a meaningful way. (All of this is important to the story.)\n\nThere was a guy in my class (let's call him Tyler) who never seemed to do the readings for class. Instead he would listen to conversations that happened about the reading before the professor entered the room and then repeat what he heard for participation points. The professor wasn't exactly fooled, but Tyler rarely got called out on it. It made me some of the other students really frustrated with him.\n\n**The Revenge:**  \nDuring the last month or so of the semester we were reading a novel about a zombie apocalypse (*The Reapers Are the Angels* if I remember correctly). On this occasion Tyler told me that he hadn't done the reading (as usual) and asked what he'd missed. I told him that the book had used the usual zombie movie trop of the main character having unlimited ammo. He made a joke about it and thanked me. \n\nWhen the professor came in and started the discussion, he immediately uses the information I gave him. I recall him saying something like \"oh she's just shooting things left and right\" at one point. The professor looked sort of amused at this point, and responded with something like \"What are you taking about? She only had two bullets left.\"\n\nTyler didn't look at me, and didn't admit to not reading, but he did get incredibly quiet. No one else in class really reacted, but my friend and I had a good giggle about it later. ",

        "text": "You know the place where I conveniently parked every day for 5 years before you showed up, which made it easy to load/unload my truck, which was done within the generally accepted USA etiquette in a spacious rural town?  Now I have to do a 7 point turn to leave, and then parallel park when I get home?\n\nEven after I asked you to stop parking there, because I have no driveway, and I have room for 2 cars in front of my house, while you have a 2 car garage and a driveway long enough to hold two semis, and enough room to park 3 cars on the street in front of your lot?   Then you told me I don't own the street?  And if figured out that you call your complicit wife before you get home, to move my trash can onto the curb strip when I'm sleeping, so you can park there and it doesn't get picked up?  (Thanks ring doorbell) I've made you aware of all this in person, and then you doubled down by putting all your vehicles in the street and leaving your driveway empty like a true sociopath that pisses off people around them on purpose?  \n\nI'm 'murican, I can do what I want!  And it leaks about a pint of transmission fluid or oil per week onto the ground in 2 puddles? The 2 owners that lived there before you never once did this, a single time.  No one else on the entire block of 12 houses parks anywhere but in front of their own buildings.  This isn't downtown LA, it's a small town with plenty of parking for every house adjacent to their own lots.  I told you that you are a \"rude dick\" when I caught you weirdos in the act of moving the trash can on trash day, and I haven't talked to you in months?  Why do you think that is?  You must be a joy to work with...is that why you've had 5 jobs in 2 years?\n\nOK, Fine, you can have it asshole.  Enjoy the giant bird feeder I legally installed on a pole in the curb strip, 2 feet away from your beater truck.  It's been about a week, and the entire roof of your ugly rustbucket dung-mobile and the never-used 20-foot trailer you recently dumped in front of it is coated in bird poo, and white and green streaks are all over the windows.  Now you can have a  shitty truck to go with your shitty personality.  Plus I can look at birds and hear their chatter and smile, instead of fuming over your never-moving junkers.\n\nYeah, I could call the city and tell them it never moves - but they would know who did, and that's a can of worms I'm not ready to open.  Poop will have to suffice.  I don't expect you have the intelligence to figure it out, but enjoy!\n\nMoral of the story: you're the asshole, asshole.  I guess you \"own the street\".  You win.",

We go to this big named dealership in the area and test drive a nice 2018 model with a little under 40,000 miles on the clock.  There were a few issues that we worked out with the manager would be fixed if we bought the car. We liked it enough to begin to move forward with the deal. I was already pre-approved through the bank and knew what I could afford, what the car was worth, ect. Basically I had done my homework.  \n\nThe salesman goes and gets the sheet and starts going through the numbers. He begins by saying, the car has LoJack, VIN etching, and interior protection already installed and that the cost was $2500 for those add ons. Also their processing fee was $900. That the add ons were non-negotiable. With tax, title and processing it would of all added up to about $5000 more than what the car was listed for with was already over priced. I was going to offer to pay the price they had it listed for a few days earlier. More than what I wanted to pay but it was in my budget and a fair deal.\n\nI was floored it pushed the 4 year old SUV to damn near $30,000. I told the salesman that was ridiculous, the SUV wasn't worth that much by a long shot and I actually could purchase a brand new one close to that price. He said fine go ahead then. So I left. Deal not done, no counter offer nothing.  \n\nHere is where the petty revenge comes in. I went  and left a one star review which explained all of what had happened and everything else everywhere I could think to. Also, all those review being the most recent it was now at the top of the list everywhere you went to see any info about the dealership.\n\nThe next day I went test drove and got an amazing deal on the exact same SUV at another dealership. I saved thousands of dollars. No add ons or other BS. Friendly salesman and they even had a dog in the waiting room. All in all a great experience.\n\nNow since price modeling works the way it does, me getting that amazing deal also works out to be the new standard price on said model SUV's.  \nAlmost instantly the SUV on their lot is now worth thousands less than it was and also sits un-sold. Did I mention they also had two on their lot.\n\nI must say I do enjoy maliciously watching them have to lower their price.\n\nOh the icing on the cake was them calling me trying to make things right so I would change my review.  I simply said sorry, already bought the car I wanted somewhere else and hung up.",

My house at the time was built in 1929 and had a small, detached garage that would fit a model T (standard car back in 1929).  I am driving a 1978 Ford LTD (sort of a land yacht) back in 1983. The alley, which is how you get to the garage is not wide enough for two model Ts to pass (let alone the LTD). I come home late one night (like 11pm) and it's probably 15-20 degrees Fahrenheit out (less than 0 Celsius). My house is in the middle of the block and the easiest way to get my large car in my tiny garage is to go from the east end of the alley to my house. 2 houses before my house someone has parked their car part way in the alley. I beep my horn a couple times, no one comes out. Now the fun part; I have to back down the alley which is icy, compact snow, etc and drive around to the west end of the alley, drive down it and eventually squeak my car into the garage as it has to go in nose first because there is no room to walk around it.  I go in the house, fill a pail full of water, carefully walk down the alley and splash water on the door locks, the windshield and windows.  Next morning I carefully back my car out, go out the west end of the alley (in my rear view mirror the car is still there). Come home that evening and the car is gone and I never saw it again. Had I seen it again, I would have called the Fire Department who would have come out and had it towed as it's illegal to block alleys (my dad was a fireman so I'm familiar with fire codes). No damage to the other vehicle as it's just water, very frozen water but water.",

        "text": "I am a customer of a certain insurance provider. I have been with this provider for four years and I have policies for 2 cars, 3 motorcycles, a camper, a home, and a rental home - all totaling about $10.3k/year in premiums.\n\n \n\nThis last weekend, I sold one of the motorcycles, so I emailed my Agent to let him know he can remove that motorcycle from the policy.\n\n \n\nThat policy runs from Sept2022-Sept2023 and was paid in full in August 2022 for $360.\n\n \n\nSince I was removing one of the bikes 3 months into the 12-month policy, I was expecting a refund of roughly $90.\n\n($360/year for 3 bikes = $120/year for 1 bike = $10/month * 9 months remaining = $90)\n\n \n\nInstead, I was told that after they removed one bike from my policy, I now owe an additional $30.\n\nThe new policy somehow went from a premium of $360 to $390 by removing 1/3 of the vehicles on the policy. (Technically more but I’m not accounting for the 3 months that have already occurred, irrelevant to the overall point/story)\n\n \n\nExcuse me, what?\n\n \n\nSo, I emailed my Agent telling him I was confused and that this doesn't make any sense.\n\n \n\nHis exact response: \"I admit I am as well. I would suggest calling (Company) directly at 1-800 Company after we close at 6pm. If you call during our business hours it will route to my office.\"\n\n \n\nI have a few issues with this response: 1) you ARE (Company), 2) 1-800 is not direct, 3) you are my agent, you are the one that should be providing explanations for policy and premium changes, 4) why should I have to call outside of business hours?\n\n \n\nJust poor customer service in every way.\n\n \n\nI push back on his response, and he responds later in the day telling me (Company) says that removing this last vehicle increased the premium because simply put, having 3 vehicles is a better rate factor than having 2 vehicles.\n\n \n\nI would understand if removing the 3rd bike reduced or got rid of a discount, and I would understand if instead of a ~$90 refund, I only got a ~$50 refund or something like that, but to say that removing an entire vehicle makes the average per-vehicle rate go from $120/year to $195/year is just stupid. Beyond stupid.\n\n \n\nI told him I was going to look for other quotes to compare this with the market. A few hours later I let him know that me and all of my policies will be leaving and I will be saving a total of 33% in the process.\n\n \n\nIn the end, I guess I'm thankful for (Company) being so stupid, because it will save me literal thousands of dollars each year.",

He kept bragging about how he could be there so quick and I looked at him and said it’s not about the car it’s about the driver and he bet me he could get there before I did. I said great let’s do it.\n\nThe shortest way to get there was mostly back roads and a short jaunt on a highway. The back roads were windy and single lane and it was impossible for him to pass me. When we got to where the highway, all I did was sit at the intersection and wait for there to be a car in the fast lane while I would merge onto the slow lane. I timed it perfectly because I knew just how fast my car could go and I, pathetically, gave her all she had and kept in time with somebody in the fast lane. Our exit was the next offramp so it was not optional for him to pass me.\n\nTo say he was ticked would be an understatement.\n\nAt that was the day my 1973 Ford Cortina, gutless, four-cylinder Beat eight dodge charger that was souped up.\n\nNote: he lived in this suburb so taking 2 cars made sense.",

When we first moved in, we had downstairs neighbors who would blast their heat, so for the first few years, we never needed to turn our heat on during the winter. It saved us some money on our gas bill which was nice. \n\nThen they moved out.\n\nWhen winter began to hit us, we realized we would need to start using the heat. My roommate and I split the bills so each person pays the bill under their name (I.E. I pay electric, but she pays gas + internet. It balances out so we pay the same amount). She pays the gas bill and will turn off the heat when we're not home or when we're asleep to save money.. Originally I didn't mind cause I could survive in both situations. \n\nowever,  things went south when she began to turn on the fans for the air or open the door. She does this when she's feeling \"warm\" (she's very non-descrip about what this means). I asked her to stop doing that during the winter because she will leave the door open overnight or leave the fans on. Normally we keep the temperature at 69 (haha nice) but when she does this, it drops it down to 65. \n\nFor the past month or so, she's been doing this after I go to bed (quick side note: I go to bed around 10pm for my job at 7am. She goes to bed around 12/1am for her job at 10am. This matters). There have been mornings I woke up to it being between 58 and 60 in the apartment. I've asked her to stop because I'm being frozen out of my own apartment \n\nThe final straw was 3 days ago, where it was 53. I was over it. So I got ready for work, and blasted the AC with the patio door open. Apparently it dropped to 49 (she texted me asking why the AC was on). I pay the electric which the AC is tied too so it does cost me, but it's 100% worth it\n\nSo every night where she opens the door or turns the fans on, I blast the AC and make it colder when I leave.\n\nThis morning, I got a text\nHer: \"Why is the AC on?\"\nMe: \"oh I thought you like it cold?\" That was 2hrs ago, reply since.\n\nJustice is the best dish served FROZEN",

        "text": "In Peru, when I was 17, I worked at a small restaurant. Mr. Bill, the owner, asked me to help him with a family party before my working time. I said \"sure, I ll help, as long as you pay me, of course\" and he agreed. \n\nIt was eight extra hours, a full day. Instead of getting 15 dollars I was supposed to get 20 but he refused to pay. He didnt even try to make excuses or justify it, he just said no. We have had a simlir incident before with my \"flexible\" shift, which would be worth 5 dollars no matter if we closed at 1 am or at 4 am. He said \"Some days are busier than others, such is life\".\n\nHe was an asshole by the way, he dated other women behind her wife, brought them to the restaurant and he was drunk most of the time whenever he showed up. He was way taller than me, around 50 years old; I couldnt really do much to fight this, so I played it cool and decided to keep working for him because I needed the money and it was hard to find a job without being 18.\n\nI only worked on weekends but I had been there for several months, so I knew everybody's schedule and how it all worked. From the very next day this bastard stole my money, I become the most stupid employee you could ever have. I started to give as many customers as possible, as many free items as I could.  A couple having a date, ordering just one beer each and a snack? I got you mate! You both get an extra beer! Hungry family ordered a medium pizza? I accidently made it extra large with extra expensive ingredients, my bad. Sodas are too expensive to order more? Let me offer you some free juice, nobody will notice. Chicken wings were supposed to be served in 6? Damn it, I thought it was an 8. Big table of 8 people ordered 20 items? I only wrote 17, no idea whats missing (an extra large pizza, the salad and the hamburguer).\n\nI kept it to the limit, right where the \"acceptable losses\" and the \"not important enough\" were. I only did it with things I knew would be hard to notice or control (like the sudden amount of 10%-20% extra cheese and meat in all items). As it was a small family restaurant, I was alone for long periods almost everyday. There could also be another part time worker who didnt care or notice what was going on. \n\nMonths of small losses must have been an average of 10-20 dollars a day, 30-60 a week, 120-240 a month... all for not giving me my 5 fucking dollars... \n\nAnd right before I quit I stole 10 or 20 dollars because I just couldnt keep the injustice out of my mind.  Am I proud of this? No, not the 40 yo grown up me, today. But the 17 yo Robin Hood me, still is. ",

        "text": "A few years ago there was a [John Mulaney bit](https://youtu.be/Mw7Gryt-rcc) going around where he tells a story of playing “What’s New Pussycat” by Tom Jones over and over in a diner. It’s pretty funny as a bit. It is NOT funny when some jackass tries to replicate it in real life. \n\nI was working as a server at a local restaurant, and we had a TouchTunes jukebox. There’s a corresponding app that you can use to buy credits to play songs with, but it also takes cash. Most of the employees had the app because we’d pay to play stuff we liked occasionally. You can also use the app\n\nIt was about 8pm and really busy on a weekend night. I was running around like crazy, when I heard “What’s New Pussycat” play on the speakers. I immediately thought, “please don’t be what I think this is.” I opened the TouchTunes app and saw it was in the queue over and over at least ten times. I was tired, my feet hurt, and I was not in the mood to hear this god-awful song more than once. I looked over at the bar and saw these two idiot bros sitting there with shit eating grins. Bartender confirmed they had just gotten a bunch of ones in change before going to the jukebox. iirc, it was $1 for 2 credits, and most songs took 2 credits. I don’t know how much money they spent. \n\nWhat they didn’t know, is that there’s a FastPass feature that’s only on the app. For double credits, you can jump your song to the front of the queue. I bought some credits and FastPassed a 15 minute Miles Davis song the bartender plays sometimes while cleaning. The looks on their faces were priceless when the song ended unceremoniously and the next one played instead of starting over. They asked the bartender if the jukebox was broken. He left the bar and pretended to go check it. “It seems to be doing fine.” \n\nI knew once Miles Davis ended their Tom Jones queue would start back up, so I FastPassed “MacArthur Park” by Richard Harris, which is a notoriously bad song and is 8 minutes long (I unironically love it). Miles Davis ended, Richard Harris began, and the bros were bewildered. They walked back over to the jukebox and started feeding more money into it. Meanwhile, I started googling “longest songs ever recorded.”\n\nThese fuckers stayed for hours. I kept queuing up the longest songs I could find. “Tubular Bells” made a couple appearances. They asked the bartender again if the jukebox worked, and he just said “yeah man idk why it won’t play your song.” I think they figured out someone was messing with them, but couldn’t figure out how. They did not suspect the random waitress who kept ducking into the server station to check her phone. One of them eventually gave up and left after an hour, but his friend stayed, looking more and more crestfallen with each new song that played. He stopped eating and drinking. He didn’t interact with the other bar patrons around him. He just stared at the jukebox. He was the last customer out the door when we locked up at 11. After that, I cut the speakers and let Tom Jones play silently. \n\nAnyway, John Mulaney owes me like $36.",

People would see unopened stuff with that name on it in the trash that he tossed out and stick it back in his mail box.

        "text": "So about 4 months ago there was a new girl at my work who had moved into the area recently. So one day I'm sitting at my desk and the company owner comes in to introduce her to everyone (small company 10 people).\nShe's the new girl my company hired to help our accountant because his job got overwhelming. The accountants had their own little area in the back of the office with their own bathroom and they barely interacted with us. We would only see them like twice a week if we took our lunches at the same time or if we were picking up our paychecks. Anyways on the first day this girl is here I'm sitting in the break room eating my lunch and about 10 minutes into my break the new girl walks in. We make some small talk and I answer some of her questions about the company. Then my boss walks in to the break room like 30 minutes later to casually ask me when l'll be done with my break because he wants me to give updates on a project I was working on. I told him I have about 10 minutes left (I like to take some extensions on my lunch when the work load is easy from time to time) and this girl has the audacity to say \"my lunch just ended and you were here settled eating before me how could that be.\" And my boss gave me the sharpest look. Didn't lead to anything serious he basically had me in his office and asked if I extended my breaks often to which I replied truthfully and he warned me and told me he'd be watching me from now on blah blah blah. Fast forward to the end of the day while I'm packing up and I see the new girl walking to her car parked next to mine and she makes some small talk casually ignoring getting me lectured for the past 30 minutes from my boss. (It frustrated me that she didn't think much of snitching) The conversation finally leads to her asking where I'm headed and I tell her I'm going to the gym a little earlier than usual because I have plans at night. She gets excited and tells me she doesn't know where the gym is in the area and asks which gym I go to. I say planet fitness and she asks if we can go together so she can know where it is so I think nothing of it and agree. (She takes her own car following me) on the ride there I zone out and get on the road that takes me home (I'm not used to going to the gym right after work) and I realize when I'm like 15 minutes into the drive and I look in my rear view mirror to see this girl is still following me. Crap. I turn onto the road that takes me to the gym and go pretty much backwards for another\n10-15 minutes and when I get to the gym and out of my car she asks me why the closest planet fitness is 30 mins away insert petty revenge idea I casually tell her \"(our city) sucks huh, no gyms nearby\" thinking she'll figure it out next time she checks navigation that's it's (barely) only 10 minutes from work Nope. 4 months later in a conversation with a group of people for a birthday party she brings up she'll be late because it's a 30 min ride to the gym and then another hour and a half for her workout before she can get home and get ready. My eyes widen and laugh. I ask her if she's been taking that same path I showed her and she says \"yes.... why?\" I explain in front of everyone and she looks so hurt. I felt kinda bad even though I didn't intend for my small joke to turn into this big situation.\ntl:dr girl got me in trouble with boss so I showed her long way to the gym and she's been using that path",

        "text": "Four years ago I was a gay guy living in the Middle East I won't go into detail but it was hell I am an American citizen so it was easy to get out,however I waited till I finished college as I only accepted myself in my junior year, in my junior year I decided I wanted to go to law school so I took the LSAT and applied to law school I did not go to a T14 but I got into a good law school graduated then took the bar and became a lawyer.\n\nI became a prosecutor because I interned at the DA’s office and liked it but I never worked on immigration cases till I became a prosecutor,  I’ll tell you what I do but I will tell you the reason behind it first, Muslims who immigrate to western countries are hypocrites, they claim that Islam is the best religion and that a Muslim lifestyle is the best as it helps create a successful society yet almost all Muslim countries are shitholes because of Islam so they do everything they can even immigrate illegally to go live in a “kufar” country when a non-Muslim Arab like the gay guy suffering because of them could have immigrated in their place.\n\nWhat I do: I just want to say that yes the US immigration system is f*cked up and that there is a 90% chance that the immigrant will lose their case and for the majority of cases they do not have the money to hire a lawyer and the government does not grant them one, so I just do the required minimum when it comes to non-muslim immigrants but Muslim immigrants are another story for me, usually illegal Muslims come into the country legally however they overstay their visa they are usually granted it because they have relatives in the country so what I do when a Muslim immigrant is arrested I go and talk to them convince them that I am their Muslim brother (I get a translator with me as I have to ask some questions in English for the tape however I speak in Arabic) and that I can help them, usually they do know other illegal Muslims in the country so I make them tell me who they are and where they are and promise that I will help them both, however, I immediately call ICE even if they are not in my county and have them arrested. If the IM has a lawyer the defense for their deportation is usually that they will get killed if they are deported as they are exmuslims and they seek asylum so I jump ahead of that and convince the IM that I am his Muslim brother and he should trust me over his “kafur” lawyer who only wants his money I tell him to tell me the truth so I can help him and I usually get a confession that they, in fact, are still Muslim and nothing will happen to them if they are deported and I add in there their true feelings about gay people and western women( it's not relevant but if the tape is played in court judges especially women judges lose all sympathy for them), the DA and SA are very happy with me as the governor (I won't say his name) is pretty pleased as not only do I get them deported but I also get intel about other IM whereabouts without giving them anything in return I am a first year and they already know my name.\n\nFor people that are going to call me a pos and tell me that not all Muslims are the same I agree but these Muslims are not like the born and raised \"progress\" Muslims here in the US believe me I grew up with them, they are the same Muslims that would have killed me if they knew I was gay and who call Muslim women whores and joke about raping them their beliefs do not change simply because they immigrated, the country is safer with them out and they do not deserve to live in a free country when they are the reason the Middle East is the way it is and cause the suffering of thousands of others I will not forget what I and people like me went or go through because of them",

I sat in the lobby near the door he left open and I was the one who had to get up and close it for him.\n\nHe didn't respond to polite requests to stop so I disabled his access pass but only on the second door, which is closest to his desk. He'd walk through the meeting room, get 6 feet from his desk, and be declined by the door. This caused him to have to walk back to me to ask if something was wrong with his access. I'd ask him to close the shortcut door he'd opened (alarm now sounding) and he always did, then I'd act confused and say \"why don't you try it on that other door over there?\" and direct him to the proper entrance to the office area, which had a mysterious 100% success rate for letting him through.\n\nI simulated an intermittent technical error by deactivating his card and then reactivating it for well over 12 months, and I acted dumb any time he questioned it. \"I've asked ICT about it but nobody knows mate. Who knows how these systems work?\" Sometimes he would forget his personal pass and I'd issue him a visitor pass and disable that on his shortcut too, which added an extra layer of obfuscation. Sometimes I'd allow him to use his shortcut and I'd happily close the door behind him, knowing that it was all part of his education.\n\nEventually, he learned that it was always quicker to walk straight to the proper entrance, and he stopped taking the shortcut and stopped leaving the alarmed door near me open, and he never found out that I trained him.",

I didn’t want to and tried to argue, my main reason for not wanting it was because Lost(I said years ago and I was only 19) was on so it wasn’t like I had a real reason. After I tried to argue Jane cut me off and pointed out that company policy allowed for scheduling changes at manager discretion with at least one days notice and she wasn’t going to discuss it. She actually refused to even talk to me the rest of the shift after I tried to argue.\n\nWhen Meg came in that afternoon I asked if she knew why our shifts were being swapped. She said she wasn’t working Wednesday at all, since she had started another job weekday mornings. I knew the right thing to do was to tell her to talk to Jane, or to talk to the store manager myself but I didn’t. \n\nWednesday morning came, and 10 minutes after the store was supposed to open I got a call but I let it go to voicemail. I waited about an hour to call back saying I had slept in since I had a rare morning off. To my surprise, nobody had opened the store. Jane had failed to find coverage for my shift like she told the store manager she had. I offered to come in but he said he had already gotten there, and it would be more helpful if I could come in a little earlier for my evening shift (I even got two hours overtime).\n\nThe next day I had to take a phone call from corporate and attest that Jane had talked to me about my shift changing. Meg had to do the same attesting that she had made it clear she couldn’t work. The store not opening on time was a big no no.\n\nThis instance caused a new store policy where all scheduling changes involving managers or key holders needed to be done by the store manager or district manager only.\nJane got an official notice of discipline and loudly complained that this set her back years in her career goals(it really didn’t, she got promoted less than a year later to store manager at another store and quit shortly after because she didn’t like it) still I enjoyed her complaining at the time.\n\nThe funniest part was my store manager commenting that he was surprised that I had said yes to the change since he knew I wouldn’t want Lost spoiled for me.\n\nI know none of this reeks of professionalism, but I was 19.",

        "text": "This goes back quite a few years. Myself, my friend Joe, and our friend Jess decided to go bowling one night. We got there, bought four games each, and ordered food and drinks. It was about an hour and a half before our lane was ready, so we just chilled at the bar and didn't really keep track of time.  \n\nWhen our lane opened up, we headed over and started our first game. We ordered quite a few beers and wings, and had to wipe our hands off before touching the bowling ball each frame. We were also having a great time just catching up, so by the time closing was near, we had only bowled two games.  \n\nWe had encountered this before, and our regular place had a very good policy. Any games you didn't bowl, they gave you a card to use next time. This allowed them to close up and guaranteed you'd come back. Well, when I went up to the desk, I was informed that any games we didn't bowl before we left were non-refundable and no credit would be given. When I brought up that we paid before we found out it would be an hour and a half wait, and we'd spent a couple hundred there that night, he told me he was the owner, that was his policy, and by bowling there, I agreed to abide by it.  I told him we didn't have time to finish the games. He smiled smugly and replied, \"We won't kick you out. You can stay and finish your game.\"  \n\nNow I was exhausted by this point, as were Joe and Jess. However, we were also stubborn, in our late 20s, and quite a few beers in. So I checked my watch, saw we had twenty minutes to close, ordered two more pitchers of beer at the bar, and walked back to our lane.  \n\nWe played every single frame of that game and took our sweet time in doing so. I kept looking over at the owner at the desk and it was clear he was not happy. They couldn't begin to clean until we left, and we showed no signs of slowing down.  \n\nAs we started our second game, I saw him pick up a phone and start talking to someone, gesturing towards us with a frustrated expression on his face.  \n\nWe finally departed the bowling alley 3 hours after closing time. I smiled, thanked him for staying, and told him to have a great night. He muttered something under his breath that I didn't hear.  \n\nBetween the hangover and the four games of bowling, I could not move my arms the next day. Joe and Jess did not fare much better.   \n\nUpon our next visit to the bowling alley, we found a large posted sign that stated no new game was to be started within a half hour of closing and any remaining games would be credited to your account for future visits.  \n\nKnowing that our stubborn petty act of defiance made things better for the patrons was totally worth the pain the next two days.",

It was my friend getting it for me in my stead. \n\nBackground: I broke up with my ex of a decade for holding rent over my head along with a bunch of other things that were much worse, but that was the straw that broke the camels back. \n\nHe was still living with me so I gave him a grace period of 30 days(he took 2 weeks longer) to move out. I found another roommate Missie who was also friends with Sam to move in who was my friend at the time. \n\n\nMy friend Sam was not in a good place with her family cause of issues so she was considering sleeping in her car. I  gave her a key and told her she can crash with me till she figures something out.\n\n\nSo my ex tries to drag his feet. He says I’m not making the best decisions being influenced by my friends. Says that the roommate can still move in and he can stay and we can work on our relationship. I still refuse. \n\nStory\n\nAfter he moves out to another state and lives with his mom does he start to harass me. I was trying to be nice and even remain friends because he requested that and I only requested for him to give me space for a little bit. He did not and even pushed. So I blocked him.\n\nHe hacked into my Facebook to unblock him. He messed with my Disney fast passes in my account. He got into my FanFiction.net account and deleted my stuff. Also took stuff that wasn’t his before he moved and then mailed back to me as a power play. \n\nHe sent me letters. Some of which I didn’t see because my friend Sam did me the favor since I wasn’t in a good place emotionally. \n\nThe basics of him saying I would be nothing without him and that I let other people get into my head rather than thinking for myself. Some threats as well. \n\nRevenge: \nI being a door mat and wanting nothing to do with just block him and try to move on. Eventually he stops and I’m just happy he did.\n\nMy friend Sam was apparently the one who got him to stop. \n\nWhat she did: \n\n-before he moved she got her cat to sleep on his pillow. He’s allergic to pet dander. \n\n-she subscribed him to gay porn magazines and had that sent over to his mother’s house under his name. \n\n-an ugly email he sent me from his job email. She sent one back to his work calling it unprofessional.\n\n-Sam got the letters that were him spouting abuse and showed them to her uncle, who’s a cop. Who then sent a letter from his work stationary  back to the return address. Stating that if any more letters were sent along with other forms of harassment that a restraining order would be placed and that would go on his permanent record. \n\n\nShe tells me this years later. I tell ya I never felt more loved and supported in that moment. She is still my best friend.",

        "text": "This is my story of petty revenge. This happened a few years ago when I was about 19. I was visiting home for summer from college. Home for me is by the coast and so my friends and I would always do beachy things when we were back in town together. This one day my best friend and I, we will call her Ella, decided to go to this look out point that we both love. It over looks the cliffs that go into the ocean and it’s beautiful. It is a small, not very well known spot up in a cul-de-sac of a neighborhood on the hill. The beach parking gets crowded and so people end up parking up the hill and in the neighborhood when going surfing or whatever. \n\nWell this particular day, Ella and I pull up and park on the side of the street behind a white van. Mind you, I was a few feet from the back of this van so I put my car and park and begin to get out. Ella is already out of the car and as I start to emerge I her an old man yelling at us. And I mean yelling! He is going on about how I am parked too close to the back of his van and he can’t get his surfboard in. Which is completely understandable, I didn’t think I was that close, but whatever I’ll move back for the guy. He continues to yell on and on at us and how we are stupid and lack common sense all that good stuff. He’s probably in his 60s and my friend and I were barely 20. My response to him yelling at us is “why can’t you just ask nicely? why are you being so rude?” Well he didn’t like that and continued to yell. At this point he hasn’t cursed at me or called me any names other than stupid. I say whatever and chose to be the bigger person and move my car. \n\nNow maybe this is just me, but if you are asking someone else to do something that takes time out of their day and inconviences them, maybe be nice about it…. As I get back in my car and turn it on, I throw it into reverse and i maybe back up 2 inches before i hear him say “yea thats right you stupid bitch” At this point I am gonna stand up for myself. I throw my car back in park, turn it off, get out, shut my door, lock it, and I look at him directly in his eyes and say “I don’t have to do shit for you”. I took a picture of his lisence plate (in case he tried anything) and Ella and I then walked away to the little look out point leaving him to sulk and think about his actions. We were literally there for maybe 15-20 minutes. When we walk back over he is sulking sitting on the curb with his head in his hands. He doesn’t say a word to us, we don’t say a word to him. We just get in our car and leave. It was small, but ohhhh man I love the fact that I stood up for myself and taught this old man a lesson about talking to people. I am sure he didn’t expect me to leave him there waiting for us to come back like that lol. Watch your mouth. \n\nTLDR: Old man was mean to me, so I made him wait for me to move my car.",

I never clicked socially, but I did make a solid few bucks off of doing people's Essays or Calculus Homework. Now \"Timmy\" was a bigger guy, roughly 250 pounds and on the Wrestling Team. During his Freshman year he got in the JV Football team and 'led' the team to victory. The Football team tolerated him, but he was very prideful in himself. Timmy wasn't that smart, barely classing his classes and even the easier classes couldn't keep him up to par for graduation. All of this leads up to him coming to me to do a majority of his school work so he could focus on wrestling and being backup for the Football team. \n\nTimmy decided one week to slack off on payments saying he'd pay when he gets his paycheck next week, but he then proceeded to distance between me only making sure I was doing his work and acting all dumb when asked about when I'd be paid. He ended up having one of his friends go and make sure I was getting his work done, but still no money. One thing I didn't mention was that Timmy gave me all of his school information to use at the library for anything digital, which would be a key role in getting back at him for not paying me for the work.\n\nFourth quarter rolled around and I was still being pushed around, I proceeded to delete all of his digital work, and email various teachers using many profanities in order to get him suspended or written up for a few days lagging him behind. Additionally I stopped doing his work for him finally and stuck to the crowds I typically sat near during most classes. When he finally arrived back he tried to explain to the teachers what happened, but since I was closer to a teachers pet in their eyes than a teenager who would go out of his way to ruin another students career shoved it off and set him to detention for not confessing to the various things I did on his account. \n\nHis grades were failing, his year average had set him in a horrible standing of a 2.5 GPA, mainly because he had a good average form earlier parts of the year and so forth, but he couldn't attend colleges that supported his wrestling and football talents and he had to begin working two jobs in order to pay for community college and an apartment after his parents kicked him out.\n\nTL;DR: Bully doesn't pay me for my work so I ruined any chance of him getting a good career.",

        "text": "  \n\nHello reddit. This story will be abit long, English is not my first language so please bare with me.\n\nI am a 22 yo guy and the one ill be talking about is a 17 yo female who I will refer her as Jane in this post. This post will contain questions like AITA and advice aswell as to vent a little. the petty revenge is just a little bit all the way down there.\n\nDue to physical and mental health issues I had to quit my studies for 4 years since I was 17 years old. For context, a normal flu could get me lying on the bed for two weeks, all these years I've been going in and out of the hospital therefore have accumulated to up to 100k dollars of hospital fees. After 4 years of being at home, I feel like I was nursed well enough to continue my studies as well as to get a part-time job as a waiter at a restaurant to pay off the debts.\n\nThrough relationships of my parents with a church, I was able to be enrolled to a Christian school, I was allowed study in a class room of 17 year old students. Due to the pandemic, my first term's classes have to be conducted online. Jane is the out going popular Girl in the school, she grew fond of me and we began chatting.\n\nWe get to know each other through texting. We haven't yet know each other for long but Jane requested for us to call instead of chatting, and then it escalated into a video call which could last for hours. Honestly, I wasn't comfortable with her calling me, not to mention video calls, it just feels like everything happened too fast. She would spam me for a voice or video call, if I rejected, she will then send me a barrage of texts, giving me a feeling like she wanted me to reply to her immediately. I simply don't have time to attend her 6 hours chat session, but I was an idiot, I didn't know how to properly handle things due to the lack of social interaction throughout the years, so I reluctantly responded to her here and there.\n\nFast forward to new year's eve, I was on my way to the beach for a vacation with my family. I received a message from Jane's male friend to play a prank on her by telling her I was gay and am in love with that friend. Jane did not take this prank well, she then use a knife to slice her arm and post it on Instagram. I wasn't very active on social networks that time so I didn't noticed what had happened until the friend frantically chatted me. I then go and console her, calm her down and proposed to take her to the hospital to see a psychiatrist after the holiday.\n\nI accompany her to the psychiatrist after the holiday, she got diagnosed with bipolar 1. Since her diagnosis, she became very advocative about mental health issues, and seems like she is bragging about her new status to her friends. She cut her self take pictures and post it online several times, singing and tagging the \"the scars to your beautiful\" song. We have to constantly give her attention to keep her from doing so again.\n\nTime goes and i feel like she grew more and more toxic. If I were to chat with other girls to discuss our homework, she will throw tantrum, throw things across the class room, attempt to cut herself in front of the class. We have to give her more attention.\n\nShe kept calling and texting me till the point i myself got depressed, I couldn't get anything done, the calls and chats will last around 6 hours, if i were to call a stop to it she will then reply \"then please reply me at (so and so period)\" her texts sometimes are hostile, berating me for not giving her enough attention, i was soo depressed that my studies are declining, so i blocked her. but when i go to school the next morning she will then use her friends to surround me into unblocking her. Even when I was in class doing my own thing reading books, she will come to me and demand me to look her in the eye when talking to her or she will berate me again. The harassment does not stop there, she would even go through lengths to find me at my work place.\n\nThe blocking and unblocking went on several times. SHE WAS CLEARLY OBSESSED WITH ME, i am soo stressed out. She began to hold my hand in class even after i declined, hugged me in front of every one after i said no, and if i wasn't hugging her back, she will then sit in my lap with grotesque poses and hug me (let your wildest imagination go on). I got a disciplinary letter because of it \"hugging a female student in school grounds.\" even though i never go near her desk other than to stop her from cutting. TO SAY I WAS TRAUMATISED WAS AN UNDERSTATEMENT, i ran and hid behind the teacher but the teacher DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! They all thought that we were playing, I was yelling STOP IT and NO! So it is one of the many reasons i don't go to school anymore. Well, she also don't go to school shortly after my absence, she was expelled for having caught on video by younger students, in a classroom for having sex with another guy! I am just so over with this. given my age of 22 and a male, this is all just too terrifying.\n\nSo for the last incident that broke the cammels back, it was on Saturday, she wrote love letters to me even after multiple times of me explaining to her that i am not into a relationship, no to mention that a relationship with two mentally ill person just wouldn't work! I didn't respond to her immediately due to me working my ass off, she then sliced her arm, her mother let me know through text and ask what is between the two of us, i just send her screenshots of our messages and tell her that i am not interested to be in a relationship with her daughter thus rejecting her. 8pm after work, i look at my phone to see texts and calls notifications from Jane asking about why and what have her mother called me for. I told her that her mother informed me about her cutting, i confronted her about the situation and she just said that \"I was only testing my new make up, you know, Halloween is around the corner, that's why. I did not cut myself, my mother just got it all wrong.\" I then explained the situation to her mother and ask the mother to check on her \"make up\" again. Affirmative. I confronted Jane about her lie and she began to \"hyperventilate\" complaining about a fever, irregular heart beat and dizziness, She Told me She AcIdEnTaLly Overdosed on her Medications as Vitamins. Instead of taking 1 pill a day as prescribed by the doctor, she took 6, which is a whole tray of said medications.\n\nI grew frantic and gave her first aid knowledge, and tell her to get her mom.\n\n\"My mom isn't home\"\n\n\"Bullshit! your mother just checked on your wound.\"\n\n\"My mother is sleeping\"\n\n\"Are you Shitting me right now!? you are in a life or death situation and you are afraid of waking your mother up? you have been lying to me all this while, i do not know whether or not to trust you. If you do not put your mother on the line now, I dare you to dare me, I will call the ambulance along with the police!\" (she lives with a single mom)\n\nSo she put her mom whom was awake, on the phone. we exchange information and the mom fed her milk saying \"it's only a small matter, no need to call the police, the milk will help with her intoxication.\"\n\nI advised and offered to bring her to see a psychiatrist again the next day for possible organ damage checkup and mental evaluation, they agreed. Since she was going to the hospital on Sunday, i have to call the hospital to inform the on call doctor to see Jane.\n\nThe next day at the hospital, Jane tries to hold my hand again and struck up a conversation, but i just answered her with a single worded response, i am simply seething, tired now, want nothing to do with her but to get things over with.\n\n\"You know, i feel much better now, i swear i wont pull that kind of stunt again.\"\n\n\"...\" (me scrolling through Instagram)\n\nGetting no better response from me, she then began to hyper ventilate and all the symptoms the night before comes again with more dramatic expressions.\n\n\"huff huff... I can't breathe HELP!\"\n\n\"We are at help, the doctor's office is literally in front of you.\"\n\nShe was led into the doctor's office shortly after and i ditched her alone at the hospital feeling extremely exhausted and took a nap before going to work, but not without blocking her and her friends, Again.\n\nFast foward to another two days, she suddenly appeared behind me which i was working, scrubbing chairs for the closing night shift, seeing her again almost made me go nuts. She explained to me that after i have blocked her she cried alot and the nurses and doctors have to surround her and give her all the attention, the doctor gave her the diagnosis of BPD thus more \"bragging about her diagnosis\n\n\"You know, BPD is the most painful mental disorder.\"\n\nI was offended because she was comparing mental disorders. by saying BPD is the most painful mental disorder, did she now disregards the pain of other mental disorder sufferers? Did she just now disregard the pain and trauma she have caused me?! Who in the right mind compares the suffering of illnesses like this! absolutely outrageous! I have forgotten how did i manage go get out of that situation but my manager plays a role in chasing her away having known her history.\n\nMonths pass by and I have to go to the school to take some homework back, (i wasn't expelled, i just simply refused to go to school.) i met with Jane's friends again but luckily there were no beggings for me to unblock her again. Jane have blocked all her friends because \"my friends are toxic\" she said. Well, an enemy of a enemy is a friend, so i forgave them.\n\nThe thought of Jane showing up in my life again and harassing me everywhere i go even at my work place slowly chips away my sanity. I have to confront her one last time and set things straight. I tend her with a drink at Starbucks and told her not to contact me in anyway shape or form, not via email, texts, calls, my home, my work, school, i want no contact, and nothing to do with her, that this is the last time i see her.\n\nWe chat for a little bit longer and i get to know that she now have a new boyfriend. Good! Now go pesture him instead of me! We also went to school together to meet up with her friends to make it clear that i want nothing to do with her. She went to buddy buddy up with her friends, saying that she ain't blocking them because they are toxic, she blocked them because she was afraid at that time that they might spread rumours about her, basically pity partying about her BPD again. Using mental illness to be an asshole, pift.\n\nHer friends don't buy her bull crap now and created their own moto \"what goes around comes around\" against her, saying we will treat her like the toxic ways she have treated them. I advice them not to scoop down to her distesting level, but i am secretly liking this, i want to make her feel pain. I am now acedemicly behind of almost everyone, i am too old for school and i wanted revenge. So we plan on boycotting her from joining our year end school outing, telling our teachers that if she is going then non of us will be going.\n\nWe have a great time, the best i ever have, playing with friends again, happy, laughing, hiking, exploring the mountains, bathe under the sunlight by the beach, collecting sea shells with everyone, it was like regaining my childhood back. We took lots of pictures of us smiling happily everywhere we go and posted in on Instagram just to make Jane feel jealous, sobbing, whining to whom she thought is her only other friend from school who happens to also detest her too, the icing on the cake to make our day. Our happiness is the best revenge to her!\n\nThat said, am I the ahole? I want to know your opinions, suggestions, and how you would deal with this kind of situation, is this a good revenge? thank you so much for reading!\n\nTLDR: female friend is toxic towards us, she has been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses, caused lots of trouble so we boycotted her and kicked her out.",

        "text": "I decided to go to homecoming with my friends because I thought it’d be really fun. I bought a two-piece homecoming fit a couple weeks before hand and showed it off to one of my friends. This friend proceeded to tell me that this girl that was not very favored in our school (for personal reasons) was going to wear the same thing.\nI told her there was no way I wanted to go to homecoming matching with her, so she suggested I try on her old homecoming dress. It fit pretty well and I fell in love with it immediately, so I went with it.\nFast forward to homecoming, I walk in with my friend, we turn in our tickets and put glow sticks on our wrists. We’re chatting up our friend group in the corner when one of my friends points out my ex and his new girlfriend (my ex-best friend) had arrived. Being the sweetheart she was, ex-best friend came up to me and gave me a hug, giving me quite a fake “it’s so nice to see you”.\nMy ex, ex-best friend, and the entirety of my friend group watched as we hugged, and came to the realization that we were wearing the exact same dress. My ex got all mad about it, talking crap to his new girlfriend and his friends about how “she did that on purpose because she wanted to make you look bad, blah blah blah”. I just found it rather funny.\nThe best part was later during one of the slow dances, a guy that my ex considered to be his (exaggerated) ‘mortal enemy’ came up to me and asked if he could dance with me. I accepted his offer, all the while my ex looked up from his perfect girlfriend to watch my new love story unfold. The jealousy that burned in his eyes keeps me going every day, and made the dance all the more better. &lt;3",

The men were given a piece of chocolate and a pamphlet containing mental health resources and crisis hotlines. Most everyone thought this was a kind gesture, except for one coworker.\n\nShe was very vocal about her opinion that men were responsible for their suicides, and that women were often the victims of male mental issues. We can call her Susan.\n\nNo one wanted to contest Susan (partly because she was in HR, partly because it was the end of our shift), but I couldn't keep it in.\n\nOur coworker that had committed suicide was a trans man. Let's call him Jim. He came out to us and everyone at work was super supportive of his transition. This news hadn't reached Susan, however. I myself wasn't super close to Jim (we had gone for a beer a few times), but I was notified by his sister who had sent a message to his most recent contacts.\n\nAs Susan was finished ranting, I called her a transphobe. She turned around and was all \"excuse me? How dare you\". I told her that she was only talking shit because she didn't like the fact that Jim was trans and was a bigot. I accused her of celebrating Jim's death, and Susan tried justifying herself by saying that \"she\" (Susan misgendered Jim like three times) was actually a victim of internalized misogyny, and at this point everyone at the table told her to sit the fuck down and shut up.\n\nRest in power Jim, I hope you didn't mind me using your death to put Susan in her place, I know you didn't like her much either.",

        "text": "The lovely r/prorevenge told me to post here, this is my first time writing a story like this so please be gentle!!\n\n\nHey Reddit, this story might be a bit wordy, but if you’re into being petty and like watching stuck up bullies get a taste of their own medicine, then this is the post for you. \n\nI’m from the uk and my school functions a bit differently to other schools in the region. It’s a private school, and we get two short holidays (about 2-3 weeks) and two long holidays (2 months or so) after every school term. This takes place before our big winter holiday! The antagonist of our story will not be name dropped, so we will call him Ego Biggins. He’s your classic year 7-9 high schooler who bullies people for a reaction, and soaks up any validation he can get from his pack of equally smooth brained “friends”. (Also to mention, he’s also one of those kids who says  ‘I’m Asian but I hate asian people.’ and who thinks he can get away with racism just because he’s not white.) you’d know what I’m talking about if you’ve met the type of guy. \n\n\nAnywho, onto the story. I’m a 14 something kid now, and if you spent more than 5 minutes around me, it would become very obvious I’m on the autism spectrum. (I’ve never been the best at masking, it just wastes too much energy) Now if you’ve met a boy like Ego biggins in your life before, you’d know his type love to get a reaction out of autistic people, and loves to pick at their vulnerabilities when it comes to social queues. \n\n\nPicture this, Ego’s on his procrastination stroll around the art class, seeing who his next victim could be. He starts picking on the kid sat next to me, saying how his artwork had the colours of the Romanian flag (like it was a bad thing?? I could never be able to put myself in the shoes of kids like this guy.) I just tell the nice kid next to me to ignore him, because Ego’s diet consists of internalised insecurities and reactions from other kids. Seeing that I knew how his quote on quote “humour” worked, he decided to find a different group of kids to pick at. Later in our lesson, I was finishing up my Andy Warhol and Roy Litchenstien inspired piece (I could ramble on and on about all different types of pop art and what a big movement it was!) Ego biggins toddles my way once again. \n\n\nHe’s singing a song (awfully may I add) that was along the lines of “I wish I knew you wanted me” over and over again. My friend and I made a joke about how nobody would want him if he kept singing like that.  Ego biggins probably heard this and told us to “shut up” and made a comment towards my friend’s art once again. So I said in return, “I know what you’re like ego, you only say shit like that to get a reaction out of people, it’s kinda sad honestly..” Then he did something that I would never let slide… Made a joke about my eyebrows… \n\nMy eyebrows are a big part of me, metaphorically and physically, they’re pretty large but I would never be ashamed of my little face pals. Growing up in the uk mid-late 2000’s you’d know that thin eyebrows were a huge fad, and if you had thick eyebrows like I did, you were ugly and horrendous looking. The trend died down very quickly, but I was still left with a lot of body and facial issues because of it. Both me and my older brother had thick eyebrows growing up (special thanks to our dad) and at one point, my brother shaved half of his eyebrows off because kids at school made fun of them, we were probably 8 and 7 at the time too, which just made it worse. \n\nEver since then I was taught to love and cherish my thick brows by my parents, and should never be ashamed of them. And even later, thick eyebrows became a trend, and everyone dreamed of having my bushy boys once again. One point on the scoreboard for humans being way too confusing. I try to be the friend that you can go to when crap just happens, I’ve had a fair share of bad experiences myself so I know what it’s like to just need a person to talk to. If I had 20 pence for every time one of my friends came up to me to shit-talk and gossip about Ego biggins, (in the wise words of victorious) “You’d be here, and I’d be on a yacht.”. Let’s just say, he wasn’t very liked and would just try to stick with his stuck up buddies. \n\n\nKnowing a lot of things about Ego biggins, I decide the next time he tried something, I’d give him exactly what he wanted… A reaction. And so he did, he took a blow at one of my friends and I went off. “Oh My Fucking God, Ego Biggins. You are so annoying, no wonder why everyone talks about you behind your back.” His big shot character broke away for a split second and you could tell he was not ready for what I said, but I just kept going. “All you do is crave support from people who don’t even want you here!” What I said got a chuckle from some kids in the class, and some even agreed that he should just sit down and continue his work like the rest of us. “No wonder why even your friends talk about you behind your back.” I repeated. In real life, there were probably a lot more stutters and murmurs then I written out, but I think I got my point across. \n\nHe stammered, and looked around at his friends, who were just as stumped as he was. He responded with a “Whatever” and a sarcastic “That was really hurtful, I’m going to tell the teacher.” I could tell he didn’t know what else to say, I’ve dealt with kids like him, and a sarcastic “That really hurt” is always their last resort, its always so pathetic. I felt really accomplished for some reason, like all the people that had hurt me were in that room, and I gave them what I had bottled up for years. After that, he didn’t bother me for the rest of the lesson, but I knew I knocked at his insecurities and he was pissed at that I knew how to dig under his skin. I think my art class next year will be a lot more peaceful. \n\nThe moral of the story; insult the brows, and meet Browser! (The cheap Mario knockoff made of 40% bottled up anger and 60% thick eyebrow hair. \n\nBut seriously, if there is one person you do not want to be during High school, it’s Ego biggins. If you find yourself slipping into a rabbit hole where you bully for attention, just do something nice for someone, even if it’s a small as holding a door open, and I guarantee that validating feeling will coarse through your veins, and it will make you feel amazing. And Ego Biggins, if you’re reading this, you’re what is wrong with the world. Knock it the fuck off. \n\nBUT if you are not Ego Biggins, I hope you enjoyed my story and I hope you have a wonderful day! \n\n\nAnd if this somehow ends up on a reddit readings podcast, what’s up! I like cheese :)",
