The other day I scheduled a dermatology appointment at the insurance's clinic. With dozens of dermatologists at their clinics, it would only be a \"short wait time\" of 6 months. I'd like to see someone sooner so decided to call and ask if their are any other options. They gave me some options for private but in network clinics. They can see me in 2 weeks!\n\nWith my last insurance company, I needed a therapist and psychiatrist. Their own therapists could see me twice a year. I called all of the private clinics and found one that could start within the month and could meet weekly. The clinic could not get me a psychiatrist for a year because several quit at once. I found a private one who could meet immediately. My partner needed surgery which was a 6 month wait at the hospital and only 2 week wait at a private clinic. They also could schedule follow ups very quickly as opposed to months later.\n\nWhile this may not apply for everyone, I hope this can help someone!",

Made a few adjustments as CC’s get paid off, got a new thing to pay for for 6 months, cheaper insurance, etc.\nList them (literally) on paper, round up to the closest dollar, add it up, divide by number of paychecks, put that amount in a new debit (that does not leave the house) card account and set everything to auto-pay. Walk away. It works.\nEdit: every once in a while you’ll get an extra paycheck and if you still put that money in there then at the end of the year you’re gonna have a couple hundred dollars left over. And that’s on top of whatever savings you happen to have going on.",

        "text": "A strange side effect of fenugreek supplements is that it makes you body odor have a maple smell to it. I started taking it years ago for an unrelated reason, noticed the side effect and did a little research. It contains a potent amount of solotone (which is also found in maple syrup) that gets processed through your sweat. \n\nI use natural deodorant which I usually have to reapply midway through the day. Been a stressful couple weeks so the stress sweat has been real and i remembered this little trick. Within a couple days I was smelling like pancakes and now I only use my deodorant once a day.\n\nOf course it’s subjective, not everyone wants to smell like maple. But it’s been a definite improvement for me.",
