        "author": "gegegeno",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/2b04ql/in_which_the_difference_between_handwritten/",
        "text": "[Thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/2ayr7r/have_you_some_advice_in_order_to_not_confuse_%E3%81%A1/)\n\nSo OP has a pretty reasonable question (ok, it's really a request for someone else to make a mnemonic for them, but still) about how to remember the difference between the hiragana characters さ (sa) and ち (chi), which appear as pretty much the same characters but backwards when you read them on the computer.\n\nActually, さ is written with three strokes, not two, whenever it is handwritten. See this [wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa_%28kana%29). You *can* connect the strokes when you're handwriting, but 99% of the time you're doing so because you're writing vertically and or writing cursive and probably using a calligraphy brush. If you write with a pen or pencil (like ~100% of people asking how to tell the difference between さ and ち), you should use distinct three strokes.\n\nWell, what does /r/LearnJapanese  think?\n\nThe top three replies at the time I'm posting this are variations on \"make a mnemonic to remember that the curved bit goes a different way\". Not anything about the curved bit only being there for the computer-generated version.\n\nWe have to make it to the 4th top-level comment to find someone who notes that\n\n&gt; In some fonts, さ is written [with 3 strokes]...\n\nand who then (accidentally?) refers to the source character for さ, namely 左 (meaning left and occasionally pronounced \"sa\" too), as their offering of a mnemonic.\n\nWhich brings us to the 5th comment, the only one in that thread to directly refer to the fact that さ *isn't even ち backwards*:\n\n&gt; Sa doesn't have the connecting line. Look up handwritten hiragana. [+2]\n\nAnd the reply?\n\n&gt;&gt; The さ can be connected (2 strokes) or not, depending on font. The disconnection is the lifting of the brush within one fluid stroke, sometimes the brush fully lifts, sometimes not. Yes, handwriting or brushy computer fonts will be more clear.\n\n&gt;&gt;When starting oit, I would just remember さ and き (sa, ki) face the same way. The other one ち cheers or cheats his friends. [+5]\n\nSo /r/LearnJapanese users prefer some wankery over how it's written in calligraphy over the straightforward answer that *no, it actually doesn't look like that when handwritten*. The fact that no learner is practicing their kana with a calligraphy brush isn't important because this reply is *technically correct*, which as we all know is Reddit's favourite kind of correct.\n\nThis sort of thing isn't unheard of in /r/LearnJapanese, to the point that rules were introduced to prevent this kind of thing. The relevant ones (from the sidebar) are:\n\n&gt;3\\. Consider the OP's skill level when answering a question\n\n&gt;4\\. Do not guess or attempt to answer questions beyond your own knowledge\n\nAnd perhaps the most most relevant to this thread:\n\n&gt;5\\. Remember that answers here are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate",
