I've heard that you might not be able to affect much because you have satisfy a lot of different people before making changes. That brings me to my next question : How often do you deal with people who are maybe a little stubborn or unreasonable that prevent you from making changes to an area? Next question, are you satisfied with your pay and work life balance schedule? If you don't make that much money, do you at least feel like you have some free time to spend with family or friends? If you could answer any of the questions above or just give some insight into this career, that would be greatly appreciated!",

Some of the ideas are even zany. \n\nHow about simply employ a “traffic and living space balancing” policy which mandates the maximum number of workers in a given location, and the simultaneous encouragement to work in a vicinal area which has reduced demand and less traffic. This effect would balance out the traffic and perhaps control the price of real estate and rents. \n\nFor example, in Cambridge Massachusetts, they have one of the most densely populated cities in the USA. Many companies in pharmacy, IT, and more are there. This has created Much stress on our infrastructure here and the cost of rents. The city should create a policy here to stop further businesses and encourage development in a nearby under-developed town, like Dorchester. \n\nWhat do you think?",

From what I understand, the relationship between coffee shops and gentrification is a fairly new trend, so that makes me curious-- what was the trendy business or development in previous decades that was often seen as a sign of gentrification? How did gentrification work in decades like the 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s?\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Up and down the east coast of the US you'll find small cities that once had a good trolley systems you could get around on, but now have pretty horrible bus networks that can't replace a car. \n\nMy question is to ask you if these small cities will ever manage to get over the hump and build a good enough environment with good enough transportation options so a person could once again live without a car without feeling stuck. \n\nTake one example I'm familiar with - Meriden, CT. Population 60,868. The denser downtown area takes up less than 25% of the town's size, with the rest suburbs, strip malls, parks, office parks. \n\nThe city is uniquely blessed in that it recently got a new train station in the middle of the downtown on a new commuter rail line between Springfield, Mass, and New Haven, CT. From there you can get down to NYC and Northeast Corridor - super convenient for the locals. \n\nThey also got a boatload of state investment to tear down a flood-prone derelict shopping mall to build a beautiful new park, tear down a dilapidated public housing project and replace it with new low income units around the city, and deal with several brownfields. \n\nConstruction has already started on what will be 600-1,000 new apartments downtown. \n\nBut outside of the new rail line, transit is horrible. There are no bike lanes, and the bus service is a joke. \n\nMany of the older buildings downtown with apartments don't actually have any parking spaces for their units, leaving residents unable to rely on a car, while not providing them with good enough transit to get around the city itself (although they can go to other cities via the train). \n\nThis is kind of a best-case scenario, but it's still pretty lacking. Are there many examples of these small cities being able to make the transition back to good urban living? What does it take for a city like Meriden to take things to the next level?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/95uh25/what_to_do_about_cars/",
        "text": "Ok, I know this is such a broad topic that it seems almost useless to discuss, but I've been thinking about this problem recently and I haven't been able to find even a satisfactory theoretical solution, let alone one that would work in practice. So I'm turning to you all to hear your thoughts.\n\n#Premise\n\nThe premise that I'm starting with is that there are many problems associated with cars. Their use causes huge numbers of people to die violently and even more people to be injured. They encourage a sedentary life style that is detrimental to the health of the populace and the finances of the healthcare system. They pollute the environment, both globally, in terms of greenhouse gases, and locally, in terms of noise and irritants. They encourage lifeless cities and public spaces through urban sprawl and low density neighbourhoods. In light of these downsides, it seems that cars are not a good solution to society's transportation needs overall.\n\n#Context\n\nTo add a bit of context, I'm from Canada. There are a few major differences that impact this discussion when comparing us to other places, such as the United States or countries in Europe.\n\nThe first one is climate. My city, Toronto, has a winter that gets quite cold and quite snowy. It's actually relatively mild compared to many other cities in Canada, but the fact is that snowy or cold conditions can be expected for about 6 months of the year. This is in contrast with places in the Southern US and some parts of Europe that can count on being balmy year round.\n\nThe other one is physical geography. Canada is *big* and things are far apart. The province that I live in is about a quarter of the size of the entire European Union, yet has less than 3% of the EU's population. Not only does this affect transportation between cities, it also affects the way that the cities grow, which in turn affects how people move around within the city. There are no real constraints to the size of population centres, and in my region there is perpetual expansion into new areas that are farther and farther away from areas with any density.\n\nIn short, the cities are sprawling and far apart, and we have cold and snowy winters.\n\n#The Alternatives\n\nI'm interesting in finding out which mode of transportation will work best for the most common use cases in the environment I describe above. There is a fairly short list of common modes of transportation, so we can start by evaluating those.\n\n1. *Private automobiles:* These currently hold the majority mode share in my city, yet they have the problems outlined above so they are the option we are looking to beat!\n\n2. *Public transit:* Maybe this is primarily a North American issue, but there is considerable stigma associated with using public transit. Few respectable businesspeople would use public transit to get to work. In my city, nobody gets onto a crowded subway car and thinks \"This is it. I've made it. I'm on top of the world.\" And so I think public transit has an image issue. And more practically, the experience of being jammed into a bus with no free seats while the guy next to you sweats too much and you're constantly about to fall over as the vehicle lurches through traffic leaves a lot to be desired. And if you think that's bad, try doing it while carrying your week's groceries.\n\n3. *Walking:* For such an important mode, I don't have much to say here. Walking is great, but it doesn't work for trips that are longer than a couple of kilometres. And in my city, that is a minority of trips unfortunately.\n\n4. *Cycling:* Cycling seems to solve many of the problems associated with cars. They're much safer for both the rider and other road users, the physical exertion required has health benefits, they don't pollute in any substantial way, and they promote dense and walkable cities due to their suitability for short distances and smaller footprint infrastructure. In spite of these benefits, there are several reasons why their use remains limited in a North American context. Even for fit adults, cycling farther than 8 km or so (half an hour at city speeds) quickly turns ones morning commute into a sweaty and tiring chore. And that's assuming fair summer weather. Even a bit of rain can transform a short ride into a wet ordeal that requires a shower, or at the very least, a change of clothes at the end of it. And winter is even worse - try taking yourself seriously when your commute necessitates a ski mask to prevent frost bite or wind burn.\n\n5. *Motorcycles:* In practical terms, these offer few benefits for most commuters. They are dangerous (primarily to the rider), require protective gear, require licensing and insurance, yet aren't cheap and don't provide much cargo capacity or protection from the elements.\n\n6. *E-bikes:* Definitely a promising option, as they overcome some of problems associated with cycling, but they are still weak in terms of protection from the elements and rider safety.\n\n7. *Ride sharing:* Having short term access to a private vehicle can be very useful for trips that can't be accommodated by other modes. However, due to the fact that they still dependent on the inefficient automobile, they are expensive and few people who consider them as an option for their daily commute. \n\n8. *Microtransit:* An extension of the previous mode, I think microtransit will get more attention in the coming years. One form, share taxis (aka minibus taxis), are popular in some areas of the world, but the West has never really taken to them. This may change in the near future however as autonomous driving technology continues to develop.\n\n9. *Autonomous cars:* This one is still up in the air, but I'd be interested in some reasonable speculation if anyone has some to offer.\n\nWith these in mind, if cars are the problem, what is the solution?\n\n* Is it simply investing further in one of these existing modes? \n* Or can one be improved in some way to make it more appealing?\n* Or is there a new mode that hasn't been fully developed yet?\n* Or maybe we're just waiting for a paradigm shift (autonomous cars, transportation as a service, etc)?\n\nI think the fact that this question is so high-level explains why I haven't yet come across discussions that deal with it explicitly. So I thank you for reading this and I look forward to seeing what you have to say!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/95jc4z/the_real_slumdog_millionaires_gangsters/",
        "text": "Slumdog Millionare, the hit 2006 movie, tells the story of Jamal Malik, a boy who grew up in the Mumbai slum of Dharavi. Dharavi has long captured the imagination of the world.  However, a lot of the media portrayals focus on the extreme poverty of Dharavi, without providing a greater context for India’s slums. Today’s podcast episode is going to focus on the history of Dharavi, the causes of extreme living conditions of Dharavi, and economic vitality that has turned Dharavi into a magnet for migrants throughout India.\n\nDharavi’s origins lie in the rapid expansion of Mumbai during the colonial era. As the city grew larger and larger in the late 19th century, colonial administrators were under pressure to evict the tanneries and other polluting industries to what was then the outskirts of the city. The tanneries of Dharavi, alongside many other small scale industries, attracted workers from throughout India. Potters from Gujarat, textile workers from Uttar Pradesh and above all leather workers from Tamil Nadu migrated to Dharavi. Dharavi quickly became a haven for organized crime, as illegal liquor production, and gambling thrived. The powerful gangsters acted as intermediaries between the municipal government and the people of Dharavi, making sure the area had access to public services such as water and electricity while at the same time exploiting people. In recent years, Dharavi has become part of Mumbai’s scramble for real estate. As Mumbai becomes a global financial capital, property values have soared, and the residents of Dharavi have to fight not to be evicted from their homes.\n\nIn part two of the podcast, I discuss the low living conditions in Dharavi focusing on overcrowding and poor public health. The government of Mumbai has long severely restricted new development in Mumbai, by restricting the Floor Space Index (FSI) to 1.33 in most of Mumbai. The FSI determines how high and intensely you can build in a location legally, and is usually around 15 for places with similar levels of population density as Mumbai. As Mumbai’s populations expanded, the size of the population far outstripped the supply of housing forcing the poor to occupy any bit of land they can. Dharavi is an extreme case of this phenomenon with population densities rising to over 850,000 people per square mile. However, since 2015, Mumbai has dramatically loosened controls and the city has seen massive upward growth. At the start of 2017, Mumbai had four buildings taller than 250 meters. Since then, 45 buildings have either been built or are under construction. The second major issue I discuss is public health issues. Average life expediencies in Dharavi are seven years lower than the national average. Dharavi has suffered from outbreaks of plague, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. Even today, sanitation problems are severe. Dharavi has one toilet for every 1440 people, although major efforts are underway to remedy this situation.\n\nFinally, I want to talk about the entrepreneurship that drives Dharavi and attracts so many migrants to the area. There are 20,000 small factories often with only a handful of employees, that produce everything from pottery to baked goods. The largest industry in Dharavi are it’s leather goods. During the 1990s, one sixth of India’a leather industry was based in Dharavi. Dharavi is also the central point in Mumai’s recycling industry. Hundreds of thousands of ragpickers collect and concentrate massive amounts of plastic trash in Dharavi. It is sorted and crushed in Dharavi, and eventually transformed into recycled plastics. Mumbai recycles 60% of the plastics it produces, a rate double that of most American cities. As a result of these high levels of productivity, wages in Dharavi are substantially higher than the national average for India. A skilled worker can earn up to 1500 rupees a day, and it is these high wages that attract so many workers to Dharavi.\n\nThe history and economics are interesting in and of themselves, but also because they are representative of conditions in slums throughout India and the world. Dharavi is no longer the largest slum in the world. Indeed, it has been superseded in Mumbai by the Ghatkopar-Kurla slum belt in size. 66% of India still lives in rural areas, the majority of whom will be migrating to urban areas over the next several decades. Dharavi’s story will likely repeat itself again and again.\n\n[www.wealthofnationspodcast.com](https://www.wealthofnationspodcast.com/)\n\n[https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/the-real-slumdog-millionaires-gangsters-bureaucrats-entrepreneurs-and-the-making-of-dharavi/](https://wealthofnationspodcast.com/the-real-slumdog-millionaires-gangsters-bureaucrats-entrepreneurs-and-the-making-of-dharavi/)\n\n[https://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India\\_-\\_Dharavi.mp3](https://media.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/s/content.blubrry.com/wealthofnationspodcast/India_-_Dharavi.mp3)",

        "text": "So I'm a soon-to-be senior in high school. I've always been interested in design, and up until recently I've planned on studying &amp; pursuing a career in graphic design after high school.\n\nMy school requires seniors to take the second semester of their senior year off of school, they go off on their own and log hours, spending their time on an independent project which they present to the rest of the high school at the end of the year in order to graduate. You can do pretty much anything you're interested in, but they're kinda large scale. I had a friend who got his pilot's license, another who made an album, stuff like that. A lot of kids look into careers they're interested in for their projects. Also, it's never just research alone, you have to actually DO stuff. Interning, classes, creating something, whatever. usually a combination of stuff.\n\nI've been sort of second-guessing what I want to do in the future lately and I got the idea of looking into urban planning or design, because it seems like it'd combine a lot of things I'm interested in. I thought it'd be cool to try and make it the focus of my senior project so I could see how I felt about it going forward\n\nI figured Reddit would be a good resource for asking questions and seeing what people who had a lot more experience with this kind of thing think so, here i am!\n\nI listed some things I've been wondering below, side note that it's totally fine if you only want to answer one / a couple or if you just want to share your thoughts aside from specific questions. Also huge thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to offer advice or help me think through all this, as a clueless teenager I appreciate it a ton.\n\nThe first thing I was wondering was how much does being creative actually play into your work? Is it an engaging career?\n\nWhat does an average workday look like?\n\nDoes your job take into consideration things like social issues? I'm interested in the more political side of things as well so I guess I'm wondering if urban design is large scale enough to deal with things like that. Sorry if this is a stupid question. I'm interested in what can be done to help poor communities.\n\nOn that note, I have a simple understanding of the difference between urban planning and urban design, but how much do they overlap?\n\nLastly, if you were to do a senior project on urban planning and design, what would you do? Do you have any recommendations for my project if I choose to do it on this? Also, if you have any recommended resources- books, websites, whatever, I'd be super happy to hear about them.\n\nSorry if this was wordy, and thank you so much once again for any help!",
