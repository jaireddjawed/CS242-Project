        "text": "As I progress through my first Lit Theory course, I am definitely seeing the progression of thought in literature and its study. People like Foucault, Derrida, and Barthes helped to transition out of concrete centers of thought, showing the interconnectedness of everything, mostly though an analysis of language. I can also, for the most part, see the trends and influences in the art before and after Structuralism/Post-Structuralism; it is just a move away from the \"center\" of thought, if you will. However, all of the works I've read in hopes of defining this distinction appear to belong to one of these \"schools.\" Can /r/AskLiteraryStudies think of any novels, stories, or works of philosophy that kind of exist in the synapse between Modernism and Post-Modernism? Maybe I'm completely false in identifying these two artistic time periods?\n\ntl;dr What to you is the distinction between Post-Modern and Modern as it applies to art and literature? What forces brought upon this change, both real and intellectual? What works of art illustrate this by kind of existing in the \"synapse\" between the two movements, if any? Feel free to give me your own definition of these two terms if you don't like my thoughts on the matter.",

        "text": "I've been wracking my brain with a way to tell a story that can be arranged, and will have either a positive or negative ending based on whether the cardinal functions that came before it were any order of positive/negative.\n\nConsider it like this:\n\nThree acts. Each act begins with a cardinal function until it leads to it's next cardinal function. Two cardinal functions = an act. Based on the first three acts, the ending can be derived from their order of positives and negatives.\n\nSome examples:\n\nNegative-Positive-Negative: Rags to Riches. Cinderella acts like this: Cinderella starts off as a slave to her aunts (negative); her fairy godmother dresses her up and gets her to the ball (positive); but at the stroke of midnight it all goes away, and it looks like she'll never marry the prince (negative). In the end, the prince fits her with the glass slipper and they marry (ends up positive).\n\nNegative-Positive-Positive: The Faustian Bargain. A person lacks something (negative); he gets it, and their life begins looks good (positive); it's so good, it completely overtakes their old life (positive); but in the end, they have it taken away from them (negative).\n\nPositive-Positive-Positive: Tragedy. Romeo falls in love with Juliet, and vice versa (positive); although they are forbidden to love each other, they do so in secret (positive); Juliet fakes her own death to get out of their tricky situation (positive); but in the end, Romeo kills himself because he believes Juliet dead, and Juliet takes her own life as well (negative).\n\nNegative-Negative-Negative: Comedy. The Tramp works at an assembly line, until he gets fired (negative); after a number of odd jobs, he's arrested (negative); living meagerly with his girlfriend, the Tramp is about to get arrested again (negative); but he manages to pull it all through, and he and his girlfriend set off on their hopeful way (positive).\n\nPositive-Negative-Positive: Horror. Teens having a party! (Positive); Killer starts murdering teens! (Negative); Looks like they got away! (Positive); Nope they didn't get away oh man so scary! (Negative).\n\nPositive-Positive-Negative: The Hero's Journey. Some person is the chosen hero the prophesies foretold! (positive); it looks like he's doing really good at it! (positive); uh oh, it looks like it might be going poorly! (negative); nope, he overcomes and saves the world! (positive)\n\nPositive-Negative-Negative: The Rebirth. A town of people is doing pretty fine (positive); oh no, some kids fell down the well! (negative); even though everyone bands together to help, they are failing, and relationships begin to splinter! (negative); in the end, they come together and as a community save the kids. Everyone learns a valuable lesson and they live even better than they did before (positive).\n\nSo, does this logic make sense-- perhaps not with *every* story, but with archetypes at least? And I can't for the life of me think what would constitute a negative-negative-positive story...\n\nAnyway, I'd love to hear opinions on this. I'd like to turn this into a project.",

        "text": "Alright, so I subscribed to this place a while ago, thinking that a perusal every now and then would suffice and that my questions would get tacitly answered, but I actually feel the need to post a few of my questions here. I hope that some can get answered, that I don't come across as too pedantic or ignorant, and that my situation doesn't seem ridiculously dire. \n\nI majored in English lit/literary theory at an Ivy League school (not name-calling, just background setting) and graduated with an overall GPA of 3.3, but a major GPA of about 3.6. My first question revolves around these numbers. Assuming a pretty high GRE score, from which programs might these numbers immediately disqualify me? This has been one of the most anxiety-inducing parts of the process of deciding whether or not grad school is right for me. Obviously a lot of programs consider your writing sample as a much better indicator of performance, but my less-than-stellar GPA has instilled within me a near-constant anxiety about whether or not I should even apply to some programs. \n\nAdditionally, if a GPA is decidedly \"not good enough\" for a PhD program, might it be helpful to get a terminal Master's in order to demonstrate your devotion to your area of study? \n\nAlso, even though my concentration was in literary theory, I found our course offerings in the area pretty sparse. In my culminating seminar, we seriously just read *Being and Time.* I know basically the origins of most strains of literary theory. I read Lacan, Freud, and Kristeva. I read Jakobson, Propp, and Barthes. I read Foucault, Deleuze, and Derrida. I'm listing these in triads because I honestly feel like the majority of my time was spent increasing the breadth of my knowledge. While I have a pretty strong fundamental grasp of all these theories, I couldn't trace their trajectory at all. I'm also completely out of the loop with regards to current trends in literary theory. I developed a rather strong interest in narratology while I was in undergrad, but I'm always willing to read new theory. Therein lies the problem. What resources would be useful to tap into the main vein of literary theory today? Are there any essential journals that would be helpful?\n\nAs you all might intuit, I did not have the best academic advisor. Due to a weird combination of family and money issues, I was left without a lot of free time at school. I made very few relationships with professors (save for one great prof) and I regrettably never reached out to my advisor. In the few times I did, she rescheduled me so erratically that it always ended in failure. Things got weird. I'm having a professor friend from my old home help me with my writing sample, but I still feel very disconnected from the field, considering my attachment to it was governed by an institution that seemed like it didn't give too much of a shit. That's not really an excuse for the disconnect, but I feel like it works as background knowledge. In any case, if anyone's got any answers/needs any clarification for these questions, I'd like to thank you for even getting this far. \n\n",

Here is the context, thanks very much.\n\n&gt; Somewhere, as you read, the secret to which I refer will jump from the page and stand boldly before you, IF YOU ARE READY FOR IT! When it appears, you will recognize it. Whether you receive the sign in the first or the last chapter, stop for a moment when it presents itself, and *turn down a glass*, for that occasion will mark the most important turning-point of your life.\n\n&gt; We pass now, to Chapter One, and to the story of my very dear friend, who has generously acknowledged having seen the mystic sign, and whose business achievements are evidence enough that he *turned down a glass.* As you read his story, and the others, remember that they deal with the important problems of life, such as all men experience.",

There's been a recent spate of works (Brian Boyd's *On the Origin of Stories*, Jonathon Gottschall's *The Storytelling Animal) looking at storytelling through an evolutionary lens, which is interesting and useful,  but not exactly what I'm after. \n\nI suppose the closest thing I've come up with so far is Wayne Booth's *The Ethics of Fiction*, and Marshall Gregory's *Shaped by Stories: The Ethical Power of Narratives*, but I'm curious if there are any big, important texts that might be worth examining in this field--or, even more centrally, specific works by the big canonical literary theorists that address or might be useful in developing a sense of how stories might shape/effect readers, or how we might think about the connection between the stories we read and the stories that are our condensations of our own, actual lived experience.

        "text": "This question arises from the following impulses which have irritated my mind and body of late:\n\nFirstly, it is my desire to become a writer, which will colour my intentions for this book. I have gone through the necessary social path of keeping my head down and getting a degree, and I took Astrophysics because I thought it sounded nice in a sentence, and I liked the ideas. Now, however, my heart has a greater sway. I want to write, and yet I have not gone past high school in England, meaning my literary education died at sixteen, and I feel I am starting from ground zero. Any guidance to get me up to a standard I am comfortable with will prove invaluable.\n\nYet, why am I concerned with writing about literature, instead of writing literature? Reading is the yin to the writing yang. I cannot have one without the other. Literature, I am convinced, is about ideas, subject to the paradox of their timelessness and being a product of the author's time and place. The ideas gained from reading James Joyce to Samuel Johnson to Chaucer inspire and tease me to the writing desk. It is about being a part of it, and that requires a submersion into literary waters. What writing about literature will do for me, and this is my intention, is to bridge the gap between reading and writing; after writing a response to a work I come to know whatever I have decided to write about (such as plot, character, or symbolism), and so I can make effective use of it. Ever since the Greeks in their education in rhetoric, imitation has been a key pedagogue in originality and mastery, and imitation must come from the salience of an engaged awareness of just what the dickens is going on. The essays will provide a record of work, and also help me in my writing by their mere existence. When I read something, we'll take Nightwood by Djuna Barnes as an example, my brain sparks something fierce from her gorgeous prose, the beautiful character of the Irish doctor, and the frank melancholy of her portrayal of lesbian love in a Paris twinged with a Baudelarian air; my brain sparks like the shrinking trail of powder leading to the kegs under parliament, and I succeed where Guy Fawkes fails: I ignite a revolution in my own mind. I might as well write out those pathways, but I am stumped as to how, what to really look for, and how to argue and present my ideas in a clear, engaging manner.\n\nIt is my hope that this book or others like it will conspire with my own efforts to build an active vocabulary and understanding of literary criticism and literature, the result of which will allow me to tackle the really hard stuff like Queer theory and anything ending in \"-ism\", and contribute to the World's Voice also known as literature.\n\nAny takers?",

Since most of our faculty members are invested in producing various critiques of neoliberalism, their line of questioning for incoming scholars almost always follow a (now familiar) path. For many of our applicants, however, the questions seemed to be coming out of left field. My aforementioned friend and I decided that this is because many students from other schools are not only trained in a particular critical \"point of view,\" but they are so inundated with this mode of inquiry that they assume that everyone else is either doing or reading the same stuff. \n\nSo my question is: Are your departments dominated by a particular scholarly point of view? Have you ever gone to a conference and found out that what you thought was \"central\" to the field is just a small corner of the critical diaspora? Bonus points if you name names.",

Why do we call it a retelling of Romeo and Juliet rather than a retelling of Pyramus and Thisbe? \n\nWas he simply in the right place at the right time for creating a legacy?

Why was I telling my friend that understanding Julius Caesar is an important step in understanding modern tragedies?\n\nI guess what I'm asking is, why is he so important to the literary world?",

I noticed that frankly, the translations were horrible. Entire chapters cut out, re-ordered, and the prose was just abominable (for the most part). Nonetheless, Dickens was uber popular in France.\n\nI was wondering if you had any similar experiences with authors being translated and disseminated under less-than-ideal circumstances. I'm wondering if it's simply a \"hype\" thing that makes authors as famous in other countries as in their own. Or are there examples of failed translation work, like if an author just completely flopped... and why? \n\n\nSorry this isn't really a question, but just a \"can you think of other examples\" sort of prompt... \n\n\n\n(PS my thesis on why Dickens was so popular is because of all the media that surrounded his works. It was like you never had to pick up a Dickens novel for the first time - you'd always sort of know what it was going to be about. Be it you had already seen a play based on it, heard a synopsis in the newspaper, or just through word of mouth, the translations didn't matter that much.)",

Writers have always questioned the inherited motives and conceptions of what and how language can be crafted into narrative, but in the early twentieth century their experiments in style began to reflect an understanding of the multivalent nature of consciousness. Modernist writers like Virginia Woolf developed their burgeoning confidence and self-awareness through multipersonal representations of consciousness, subjective time strata and a shifting of the narrative viewpoint. In her early short story “Kew Gardens,” Woolf develops the motif of light and colour to create a milieu of consciousness that penetrates the reader’s subjective perspective and forces him or her to think differently.

        "text": "On the surface, Raymond Carver’s 1983 “Cathedral,” is a simple, meandering short story set in a nondescript, lower-middle class American home in which nothing much really happens. An unnamed, unhappily married couple hosts Robert, a blind, bereaved widower and long-time friend of the wife of the narrator. The three characters drink, eat, smoke and converse and then the story ends. However, the apparently contentless plot and stark prose conceal a complex and profound meditation on modern life. Six years earlier in his 1977 book The Society of the Spectacle, Guy Debord contends that social life in a capitalist society “where the modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles.” (12). Living pacified and depoliticized lives, people are stupefied and distracted by a perpetual onslaught of images, from the urgent task of living their lives for themselves. Debord sees a society of liars lying to themselves, a society where even the deceivers are deceived. People living life vicariously through “images detached;” the still or moving images, frames and reels of mass media consumer society. Their very lives become fused with the projected world-views of image producers and the sum of this “immense accumulation of spectacles” becomes their reality (12). In “Cathedral,” the narrator is an example of Debord’s spectacular individual, he cannot not understand or relate to himself or the people around him in any meaningful way, is jealous, insecure and ignorant. At the outset, Carver’s narrator is an alienated and bigoted character, insular and prejudiced to everyone including his wife, but as the story concludes he finally confronts Debord’s spectacle head on and is humbled and transformed by it. Through Robert’s outgoing, understanding and warm-hearted nature, the narrator is able to connect with another person in some meaningful way and by overcoming the obfuscating lure of the spectacle, the narrator is able to see the world through the eyes of a blind man, while realizing and sharing his own perspective with another person.\n\n**EDIT: First revision is below, although I feel I may still be using too many ajectives.**\n\nGuy Debord argues in his 1977 book The Society of the Spectacle that people in modern capitalist societies live pacified surrogate lives and are stupefied from the urgent task of living for themselves by the perpetual onslaught of the mass-media. Debord sees a society of liars lying to themselves, a society where even the deceivers are deceived. The stark prose and minimal plot of Raymond Carver's 1983 story “Cathedral” conceals a complex meditation on the social conditions of contemporary American life and presents a way out of Debord’s bleak vision. In “Cathedral,” the narrator is an example of Debord’s spectacular individual, he cannot not understand or relate to himself or the people around him in any productive way and as a result lives a jealous, insecure and ignorant life. While the narrator is nameless,  Robert, the blind, bereaved widower and long-time friend of the narrator’s wife is his antithesis; worldly, charismatic and confident.  Only by seeing the world through the eyes of a blind man immune to the influence of the spectacle, is the narrator able to realize and share his own authentic perspective with another person. Although at the outset Carver’s narrator is alienated, insular and prejudiced to everyone around him, by yielding to Robert’s influence he is able to confront the spectacle that has become his reality and undergo a humbling transformation. By physically connecting with Robert and drawing an image of a cathedral together, the narrator is able to empathize with another human being and overcome the obfuscating lure of spectacle.",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI'll be referring to a couple of threads and posts you've made without attribution as I have forgotten them all and did not document them, immediate evidence of my poor scholarship for which I apologize.\n\nNon LitStu(dent), but semi-versed in critical theory. At an important intersection I decided to concentrate on creative writing as opposed to English/theory. One of the reasons was that I could never wrap my head around the *whys* of reckoning with a text via a particular lens or methodology. In particular I'm baffled by anachronistic readings. I saw a post about a feminist reading of \"Rappaccini's Daughter.\" It reminded me of one lit class in which we did a post-racial reading of *Heart of Darkness* and a feminist reading of *The Scarlet Letter.*\n\nI'm not being pejorative when I ask: what is the point of doing a reading that lies completely outside the scope of anything the author could have come into contact with when s/he wrote the book? I realize that a lot of these discussions move past the author and into a grand notion of cultural continuity, but how does that function when you bring a contemporary concept to a book that was written in the mid-19th century? What is its purpose? Do your studies exist on the plane of timeless culture, like the aboriginal [Dreaming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtime)? I like that idea because it is romantic, but I understand romanticizing theory would be frowned-upon in these circles. \n\nI read in another thread that Judith Butler's writing is elegant because of its specificity as opposed to its evocation. But when you're comparing two texts that have no connection in history, or a retro-active connection in history (i.e., as in one of my classes, doing a Nietzschian reading of *Anna Karenina*), how does that move beyond the subjective? How is it more analytical to argue feminist points in a pre-feminist text? As someone with a very limited education and exposure to rhetoric and theory it appears subjective: in authoring the paper you are pulling two texts from your own experience, analyzing them according to a lens/method from your own education, and drawing conclusions according to that lens/method. I can only think in abstractions, so I picture it as some kind of marble sculpture: that each approach is another chip off the surface, closer to the inner truth of the form. But I think I'm probably wrong.\n\nI don't want this to be an antagonistic clash between evocation and specificity. I realize these questions sound provocative, almost as much as when a friend in finance asks me why on earth I'd consider becoming a writer. That isn't my intention. I want to go beyond the \"Why are you in lit studies?\" threads and gain a deeper understanding of the function and purpose behind a discipline that is intimately related to my own.\n\nI recognize that this may not be an interesting topic for you guys, since it really only serves to affect my own ignorance/lack of understanding. But thank-you in advance for any thoughts and responses. \n\nAlso, props to sillywalks for our protracted fight in r/literature which led me here.",

        "text": "There's a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/u19b7/people_always_lament_bad_film_adaptations_of_good/) in /r/literature about this, but it seems like sort of a circlejerk right now. I had a sort of question I wanted to know your opinions about. \n\nIt's obviously a little reductionist to talk about a book or its film being \"better\" or \"worse,\" or even saying something like \"the film is an improvement on the book\" since as we all know deep down in our hearts - the movie and the book are two completely different representations in two different media and as such should not be judged according to the same criteria. \n\nHowever, it seems like since the possibility first appeared in the late 19th century, novels and films have been oddly linked. Perhaps for a reason as simple as both have been \"popular\" modes of representation (popular in the sense of bourgeois, or maybe even \"for the masses\"). In these early days, film had to rely on the popularity of a novel in order for its own success - that is, cinema followed novels at a time when it was also developing its own grammar as a new medium. Now, since the film has \"won the war\" of popular representation, it seems to me that some books are being written in order that they might be made into films. That is, literature is adapting the grammar of cinema. I wanted to know if asklitstudies thought the same thing. \n\nIt seems like books like the Da Vinci Code, Hunger Games, Harry Potter are written in the same sort of pacing as movies - that is, using a sort of \"cinematic time\" that only keeps readers' attention for a moment before hurrying them along elsewhere. Obviously this means also that \"suspense\" must be created, and to do so, the book must read easily (suspense would be killed if you had to go back and reread a paragraph). This seems to me to be the reason that a lot of young-adult fiction is now getting big (and subsequently turned into movies). \n\nThere are obvious exceptions to this trend, like the Stieg Larssen novels maybe. I haven't read them. But overall, I get the impression that not only has film become the dominant medium and as a consequence the novel market has had to adapt, but also that the novel market has begun taking on characteristics of the movie industry, creating some sort of giant conglomerate in which novelists are become screenwriters, and money can be made not only from the movie studios that make pulp five-part adventures, but also by the publishers who can then profit off those people who say with their noses upturned \"well, the book was better.\" \n\n**TL;DR - Are novels like the Hunger Games are now being written in order to become movies?**",
