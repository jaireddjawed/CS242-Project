        "text": "Before I go on, please do dismiss my ignorance on the topic‚Äîwould just like some clarification. \n\nI recently came across the existence of vampire crabs and immediately I became confused on what led to the wide variety of colorations the species has. Is this considered allopatric speciation? I also thought maybe sexual selection could be at play here yet that also confuses me because both male and female crabs have the same coloration (or mostly similar). Honestly this could be a generalized question too. \n\nI'm just really fascinated about these little creatures and was just curious. Again I have no idea what I'm talking about, I don't even posses the same knowledge an ameture would. Thank you.",

Relating the information I learn in class to life scenarios (so to speak) keeps me motivated and interested.\n\nWhat is the purpose of understanding phylogeny? Does it just allow us to understand life from an evolutionary perspective better? Or?\n\nHow could understanding phylogeny be useful, say in medicine?\n\nJust curious.",

If this is the wrong place to post this kind of link, let me know and if possible please point me to somewhere you think would be more appropriate for people to engage with it!)\n\nHey everyone! First time posting here - I‚Äôm running a (very early days!) channel with myself and a few friends focussing on educational content creation in the biotech sector. The aim is to take cutting edge research and present it in a more accessible way than specialist papers; thereby helping to spread the message and spread the interest in the work done. The eventual goal is to try and build up a community where specialists and the general enthusiastic public alike can talk about some of the really awesome stuff that biotech can offer - and we'd like to kick this all off with biological circuits and synthetic biology!\n\nWhether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious about biotechnology, we'd love to get your feedback, so let us know what you all think :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/74xba2jm66ka1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3769c8de025ce98b15fa1cf6f46ae9c468d9118b",
