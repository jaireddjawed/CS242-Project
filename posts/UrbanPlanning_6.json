        "text": "Hello, not an urban planner, but I undestand why sprawl is bad from an overall cost burden perspective. So I assumed the more dense housing is, the more cost effective it should be and thus the price per sqft should reflect this. However, it appears to not be the case in my local market (Chicago). It actually appears to get more expensive via assessments the taller the building is (even if you are on the lower floor or w/o a view) compared to near by mid-rises. Is there actually a such thing as \"too dense\" and if so where is the happy medium?",

        "text": "Taking the elevator today, the above thought came to me.\n\nElevators actually are very similar to transit, but in vertical form: a shared space that goes go to multiple locations.  \n\nElevators have characteristics that transit might be able to learn from:\n\n1. Elevators themselves are money-losing in themselves but are “worth it” because of the added value they bring to the floors they serve more than make up for their cost. Transit can be the same: a locality can run transit for free but charge (e.g. property/land tax, lease, service fee) the properties that the transit serves.\n\n2. Elevators are “on demand”. You call them when you need them and they come. They’re on stand by otherwise. Transit (short of automated vehicles) could also have drivers on a bus route be on standby and only come out when someone needs it. I guess this might work better for a low-frequency bus service on short routes. Maybe last-mile service? I guess UberPool is like this.",

        "text": "I'm asking this because I don't have any academical skills in architecture or city planning, I've been thinking about this for a while, and at the same time, people have been very vocal about stopping these building plans.\n\nI live south of the city center, near [Telefonplan](https://www.google.se/maps/place/Telefonplan,+Stockholm/@59.2987092,17.9940321,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x465f77ad2594a027:0x51dbd3ed69cd9e82!8m2!3d59.2987065!4d17.9962208) where this building plans are ment to be.\n\nThere are plans for land development around the subway station, since it's today just a parking lot an an open subway ditch. It's 3 stops from what's considered the city center or you can bike in about 10-15 min, so prime area for city development.\n\nThe first suggestion was the Tellus Towers, here is an article in Swedish, but look at the renders: [Tellus Towers](https://www.fastighetsvarlden.se/notiser/klart-har-byggs-78-vaningar-hoga-tellus-tower/)  \nThe taller one supposed to be 78 floors.\n\nThis suggestion has however been stopped and a (in my opinion worse) alternative has been suggested. This is the plan I support.\n\nHere are my arguments why I want this:\n\n* This is an underutilized subway stop, we don't have to build new public transport, and luckily Stockholm is moving to reduce cars.\n* It's an open subway ditch, it's today a scar in the landscape that you can't pass, so building over it will actually increase walkability.\n* Swedish housing prices are insane, we have built to little since the 70s. We have to build more. It's not optional anymore. On a personal note, when I got a job offer in Stockholm, I moved back in with my parents 70km away before buying an apartment here for so much money I will still be in debt when I retire. Not all people are willing/able to live with their parents again.\n\nHere are the arguments against, and my response to it:\n* While the building style wont fit in with the old 40s/50s functionalism (the nice kind) we already have building in a lot of newer style. It's not like we are in a museum. \n* There will be more people on the subway. Yes, and that's a good thing. Just run more trains.\n* The military and Bromma airport thinks it's too high. The future of Bromma airport is in question anyway. Several political parties agree we don't need a city airport. Bromma airport is just for people destroying the environment because they don't know how to show people Powerpoint over the internet.\n* The \"beauty council\", the most nimby people of all said, known to hate tall buildings, said:  \"You would be able to see it from Svandammsparken\", and yes, they are correct, [here's google streetview](https://www.google.se/maps/@59.3013834,18.0060157,3a,75y,71.94h,90t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1sAF1QipMMQ2tusUkKxCbncoMZU8l-oZ-fjt0U3130ttC0!2e10!3e11!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMMQ2tusUkKxCbncoMZU8l-oZ-fjt0U3130ttC0%3Dw203-h100-k-no-pi-0-ya225.43845-ro-0-fo100!7i8704!8i4352), from the park you can see buildings in 360° direction, it's called a city. \n\nSo, these are the reasons I'm pro. It seems like it's so much easier to be against something, right now there is a petition to stop this entirely, and I just want to argue a different standpoint. \n\n*(disclosure: 2011-2014 I worked web design for a company with strong ties to Swedens biggest construction companies NCC and PEAB, and while that peak my interest in building, I have no financial or personal relationship today with any company involved in this or construction in general)*",

        "text": " I   am currently working on a book featuring a series of fictional cities.   They were all planned to be walkable and entirely free of cars (you   can't even get inside with a car and need to park it outside).\n\nSo   my idea for how these would be planned is based on a structure of main   streets, which has dedicated bicycle and tram lanes. The different   traffic forms are each separated at the very least by waist high hedges.   Obviously, the foot lanes would be on the edges where all the shops   are, but I am not sure how to arrange the bike and tram lanes. Should I   put the tram at the center with the bike lanes in between the tram and   foot traffic or the bike lanes at the center with the tram lanes right   next to the foot lanes. In the first case, pedestrians would have to   cross the bike lanes (I personally made many encounters with obnoxious   cyclists, hence why I insist in separating them from foor traffic. But I   hope cyclists ignoring traffic laws and basic human decency is just a   German thing.). The second option would require dedicated bike  crossings  over the tram lines, because those are supposed to be just  rails  embedded on grass to reduce noise and impervious paving.\n\nNow onto the actual city layout:\n\nMy   idea was to start the cities as four spoked wheel made out of the main   streets explained above. The outer ring would be occupied by farmers  who  have their fields all around the city and at the central hub would  be  the main tram station, park and school. Initially, just the outer  ring  and center would be built up with everything else being filled out  as  the city grows. Once everything inside the four spoked wheel is  filled  up, the fields around the city are partially bought to build  another  ring of main streets around the city, this time connected to  the 1st one  through 8 spokes, 4 of which are direct continuations of  the original  ones. Rinse and repeat as the city grows.\n\nIs this a viable concept for a city or town?\n\nHow big would the initial 4-spoked wheel be?\n\nWhat would be the added radius with each added ring around the original city be?",

Contemplated between M.Sc in engineering or a M.Plan program and decided to do a M.Plan.\n\nThere was a post on LinkedIn about the idea of a plangineer, as planners can learn from engineers, and engineers can learn from planners. Especially in the area of transportation engineering and planning where there is lots of overlap. \n\nI don’t know think I can get personally behind the profession of planning the more I study it. Urban planning as an area of study is super fascinating and thought I could combine skills for mining development projects. By considering environmental, (engineering)social, community, and economic impacts of development projects not just mining.\n\nBut at least right now the classes just talk about urban issues all the time at a high level and how planners are important and a solution to the problems of the modern city.I’m sorta getting tired of hearing buzzwords all day, sustainable development, transit oriented development, complete streets, mixed use development, eyes on the street, walkable communities, biourbanism, ecosystem services, public space, Jane jacobs, infill development, f**k cars, and f**k sprawl it’s bad, etc. \n\nLike I want to learn more skills like GIS, property law,AutoCAD, sociology, municipal administration, project management, skills and all I am getting is new urbanism crap. Like I’ve learned more from a municipal politics class about planning than from my urban planning classes. That planning is politic and legal process. Zoning is a balance between public interest and private property rights. \n\nHaving an engineering background I just shake my head on some of the stuff that is said as it’s not technically feasible to implement. We were asked to do a site assessment for greenfield  development. The prof asked us to use a simplistic model for runoff so we could design a “biophilic storm water pond”. I said that is to simplistic of model and needs an engineering analysis  and not something a planner would do. The prof got defensive and other students questions my experience with this as I continued to challenge the prof.\n\nI don’t know I think planning education is teaching student they can do more than they actually can and makes too many simplistic assumptions. I am starting realize why some engineering profs said planning was a bad idea to me. Please say this is not the average case and working as a planner is more realistic than what’s taught in planning school and not a bunch of new urbanism crap all the time?",

        "text": "It is important to note, first, that I am based out of the United States, so this question and most of my observations are drawn from my experiences in American cities.\n\nThe neighborhood I live in presently is, for the U.S., relatively historic. Much of its built environment was planned, zoned, and constructed prior to 1945, with the greatest amount of development occurring, I think, specifically between 1890-1930. Not unexpectedly, there seems to be a very distinguishable pattern of development: at least on main commercial streets, most lots were developed at a very small scale. These buildings usually contain one small store on ground level and perhaps an attached apartment above, and generally do not exceed two stories in height. The lots are organized in a high-density manner, and the difference in ornature between buildings makes it obvious that they were constructed by different developers, or at least did not seem to be part of one large building project. \n\nThis is in stark contrast to some of the newer developments I have seen being built as of late. The scale of these buildings is often massive, in some cases taking up multiple blocks. They are usually luxury housing developments that contain a large number of units and numerous ground-level stores. The difference is striking, and this present form of development contributes to a more uniform, bland urban environment, in my opinion. \n\nDoes happen to have any knowledge of why development seemed to occur at a much smaller scale in early American urbanization, and why this has changed more recently? It is a question that has puzzled me for some time.",

Is that correct?\n\nDo urban designers draw details, like to the level of the handrail joinery, bolts, and concrete mixes? Or do they produce more schematic drawings that are then detailed by other disciplines?\n\nThis isn't a judgment question—just trying to understand the limits of different domains in the public design realm.",

        "text": "It's the *aspect ratio*, silly. \n\nLook at a block in Manhattan or any old city in Europe and you see a row of five to ten-story buildings about five windows wide each. Compare that to a new development in Denver: one six-story building that stretches for about 200 feet. We had a recent thread about the homogenization of modern architectural styles across cities, but what's more unusual about the present day is the homogenization of *blocks*. \n\nThe most likely driver of the \"wide-rise\" AFAICT is the parking garage. If you have a big long wall of a building, you only need one garage entrance for all of these apartments, while if you have multiple narrower buildings, you have more entrances, more curb cuts, worse pedestrian experience (in one way), and less usable street frontage. \n\nThe common refrain is to eliminate parking *requirements*, but this is not enough: in order to eliminate curb cuts, you must remove parking *entirely*, or introduce an alley or some kind of easement — difficult to do on a block already developed. You can maybe have a single development comprising multiple buildings with an alley or conjoined garages, but sites will be few and far between — it's just an added expense on top of the half-a-block-wide complex budget, driving costs ever higher. \n\nOne possible work-around is for cities to build public garages and sell floors to no-parking buildings nearby (within, say, a kilometer walk). This generally approximates what I think should be the role of cars in medium-size city downtowns in the medium-term: there when you need them, but not taking up space downstairs. But it runs into a thorny provisioning problem, a pricing question, and probably annoys environmentalists and anti-car futurists (more government investment in parking, even if you hope to recoup costs). You can also try to encourage developers to overbuild parking in one building and sell it to another, though this is mostly the same problem with extra steps. \n\nAnyone familiar with cities working to address this problem? Some approach I didn't consider? Fan of wide-rises and mad at me for trashing them?",

        "text": "In an article by the infamous suburbanist Wendell Cox, he claims that upzoning worsens gentrification and increases land prices:\n\n&gt;Densification has its academic critics. [Andrés Rodríguez-Pose (London School of Economics) and Michael Storper (UCLA)](http://econ.geo.uu.nl/peeg/peeg1914.pdf) have concluded that **there is insufficient evidence that “upzoning”** (an important densification strategy) **can improve housing affordability and that it could “increase gentrification** within prosperous regions and would not appreciably decrease income inequality.”  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Patrick Condon](https://www.livablecalifornia.org/vancouver-smartest-planner-prof-patrick-condon-calls-california-upzoning-a-costly-mistake-2-6-21/) of the University of British Columbia has shown that densification in the city of Vancouver has not improved housing affordability. Condon had been an eloquent advocate of densification but describes how the “indisputable” evidence convinced him to the contrary (Note 2). Condon also provides a reminder that **“upzoning” increases the value of land (by increasing the development value).**\n\nI haven't got the time to read Pose &amp; Storper's paper fully, so I don't know the soundness of their methodology; which is why I hoped to get some feedback on it or on whether the paper has been discussed in a prior thread on this sub. I just vaguely know that they argue that building more market rate housing that is aimed towards wealthy people will increase gentrification and not reduce housing affordability. \n\nThe ''upzoning leads to increased land values via increasing its desirability for development'' seems intuitive, but I'm not too sure how it works out in reality.",

I don’t get why we’ll designed subways are praised when the ground above is flooded with cars. Also I think metros are a knockoff and worse version of trains. Does anyone agree? If not why?",

It's been very useful to save my favorite reading notes and add personal annotations. What are people thoughts on the excerpt below? \n\n&gt;*There is a ratio of improvement value to land value that is stable. If that ratio gets too low -* ***a situation where the land is valuable compared to the improvement on it redevelopment pressure increases.*** ***A cheap improvement on an expensive piece of land is a prime candidate for redevelopment.*** *Someone is likely to buy the property, demolish the existing structures, and build something new, something of higher intensity that would more closely justify the higher land value. An expensive improvement on a cheap piece of land is likely to raise the value of the land, not just on the site of the improvement but on neighboring properties. This is especially true if the improvement is built in such a way that it complements surrounding properties.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*These two realities rising land prices inducing redevelopment, redevelopment increasing land values - work together in an incremental framework of development to create a natural renewal mechanism within a neighborhood.*\n\n**This seems intuitive and makes sense, have people seen things that cut against this principle in the real world?** I'm sure there is more nuance out there and he's simplified it for the book so interested to hear people's experiences in local government, development, etc. \n\nI have read this excerpt and can't stop thinking about gentrification. **Is gentrification simply land that is relatively valuable to the structures / buildings in the area?** Why would land in Brooklyn only recently increase in value relative to the structures? It seems as though the structures were at one point new, and in that point in time the ratio of land to improvement was stable. But then, over time, the structure became less valued relative to the land itself (redevelopment pressure increases).  Is it this simple? Cultural shifts, like preference for urban life over suburban living, also play a role but this framework is good for an elementary understanding of development. \n\nI'm going to start reading [Human Scale](https://www.amazon.com/Human-Scale-Revisited-Classic-Decentralist/dp/1603587128/ref=asc_df_1603587128/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=312736202848&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=8929474995297616127&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9021758&amp;hvtargid=pla-564870419978&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=62017409437&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=312736202848&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=8929474995297616127&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9021758&amp;hvtargid=pla-564870419978) and posting to an Urbanism book club on CommonPlace - feel free to join and share your favorite reading excerpts regarding urban planning and design.",

The development was built skirting the law to prove it had a reliable source of water before building.  Drought has impacted wells in the area, so importing water by tanker truck is the developments only source of water.  Scottsdale is stopping delivery due to its own water and budget shortage issues.  \n\nArizona has demand of housing from people to coming to Arizona, but not enough water for those people in large portions of the state.  Seems like the law of only allowing development in an area with a water source should be enforced.   That makes a very difficult situation for the planners in Arizona trying to increase housing in the state.",
