        "text": "I (f31) and my friend C (f32) have been friends as long as we remember. We used to live in the same neighborhood when we were kids. In the early years of our frienship we developed a weird bond as if we are like family to each other; even if it is a dysfunctioning one it's beyond criticism. \n\nEven when we were young we were aware that we are fundemantally different than each other. I remember telling each other that we wouldn't be friends if we met in high school. Basically I'm the introverted nerd and she is the extroverted social butterfly. So we grow even more apart during college but eventually 6 years ago we started to live and work in the same city again. We tried to act as sisters to each other but we were very well aware that there is no way we can be roommates. While we try to survive in the big city on our owns we both supported each other in ciritic moments but we also neglected each other in some very critic moments too. \n\nBy 2020 we had our fair share of gratitude and resentment against each other at the same time. When covid happened my life got totally destroyed in every area. I was basically homeless and C welcomed me to her house. I quickly found a new job and started paying rent but it took me 9 months to leave her place.\n\nWe both suffered from mental health problems and dysfunctional families. So that 9 months was not easy for either of us. After a few months I was totally depressed, at some point I started treatment and left her place as quick as possible. \n\nAfter the seperation she asked my help about something and I told her I am so depressed that even though I was willing to help I may fail and I would actually be happy if someone else helps her. I also noted that if she fails to find someone else I would do my best to help her. So this was the last drop in the glass and she told me that she doesn't want to see me for a while on whatsapp. I didn't fight back, accepted and continued my life. Ever since my sole priority is my mental health. \n\nAfter cutting her relationship with me, C moved to a different city and we hardly see each other two-three times a year, when she feels like spending some time here. She feels entitled to make plans depending on she can stay with me whenever she wants without even consulting me. When she stays at my place she also acts as if she can do whatever she feels like. Not caring about my work schedule, always inviting people over, leaving her laundry in my laundry basket, not bothering with tidying her mess at all and such. \n\nIn the meanwhile I have only been to her place for a weekend and it was a complete disaster. I was on my way back only after 4 hours in her place. When I left she followed me, we argued, cried, told each other we love each other yada yada yada. \n\nThis brings us to yesterday. Since our \"scene\", we didn't really talk to each other. I heard that she will be in the city through mutual friends but I did not invite her to stay over intentionally; because I'm afraid of having another scene. She has many other friends that she can stay over but yesterday she came to my place for a beer and she announced that she decided to stay the rest of her visit in my place. \n\nThis alarms me because I don't feel comfortable with her around but if I tell her this, her response can crash me for good. I don't think she will be able to hold her anger. So will I be the asshole if I tell her I want her to leave and even maybe that our friendship does not work for me?",

He noticed my response and retracted without saying anything. I was too frozen in shock to say anything. I've seen this look in some men's eyes earlier even when they were not drunk. I am confused by what it really means. My partner's eyes never appeared this way when we were intimate. What the fuck do such eyes on men mean?",

        "text": "I was with a man for about 3 years. We met a week before lockdown. He isn't someone I would have chosen for myself but we connected at a party then all of a sudden everything was shut down so a relationship developed. I knew there were issues but also working in alternative health care I knew I could support him. He has severe childhood trauma that manifested as pain, insomnia, anxiety, defensiveness, contempt, inability to accept responsibility due to a crippling fear of disappointing others and... ya he was a mess. He went from 9/10 chronic pain and not knowing that sleep was meant to be different than that half awake/half asleep thing to no pain and deep sleep. He learned to listen without interrupting and empathise a bit. He went from living in his brothers spare room with a shit job to getting educated in a similar field to mine and will be making 120k/year when he finishes school, I set all that up for him. He found he was gifted at music because I could see it and suggested it and supported his growth. He fell out with all his old friends and found a new community of people that helped him thrive and be his best self and he has fallen in love with the new him. Normally I would never take on a project this intense but... lockdown... and oh fuck the supplements and acupuncture and massage and therapy... I helped him with all of it. He went from a broken and shattered man that would joke about being a piece of shit to someone who could say, \"I felt what you said was unkind and I would prefer you spoke to me this way\". Every time he set a boundary I sizzled with delight. \n\nI knew it was dysfunctional the whole time. I knew I was in a saviour role and he was seeking some parental figure in me. I was never deluded and I never thought this relationship would stand the test of time. But circumstance even post lock down lead it to be mutually beneficial. \n\nEventually the one sided nature of things lead to burn out on my behalf and I ended things. He had moved away to do his education in September just an hour south of me so we were still spending time on the weekends but when it got to be too much it was easy to cut it off. I ended things 2 weeks ago and just last Wednesday he was calling me to tell me he loved me and wanted this to work. I sat with it for some time assessing how much work I was willing to put in. Truth be told I wasnt overly invested but I believe his heart is good and he just had a really, really fucking traumatic upbringing. So tuesday of the following week I called and said that I would be willing to do therapy and work on things but it needed to change. He flippantly told me he had gone on a date the night before with a woman that had all the same trauma as him and could speak his language and it was the best memory of his life and the sex was off the charts and if I had ever gone on a date like that I would never have anything to do with him again. \n\nI could feel my reptilian brain rising, \"my mate!!! destroy this!!!\" but my rational brain said,  \"good for him, hes happy and I didnt want this anyway\". He was tactless, sure, but ultimately whatever, I dont own him. \n\nAnd then... and fucking then... I cant even.\n\nI got sick and was bed bound for 3 days. I had just bought a property out in the boons because I like privacy and when buying this acrage my biggest fear was being out here alone in a snow storm and sick. I shit you not, the day I got sick we got FEET of snow. I run only off wood heat and was so sick I couldnt wade through the snow to get fire wood. Im out here, alone, sick with no heat. Finally, 3 days later I rise only to find my pipes froze and I have no water (didnt even consider that in my dystopian hell scape). So, weak from not eating for 3 days I have my head lamp on as I scurry around in the crawl space trying to figure out if the heat tape is working, checking the pump house, bringing in wood, shovelling my walk and the trip to the wood shed before weakly heading into work. I got home tonight and learned of a weather warning suggesting we be prepared for a week of no power. I just spent a grand at costco and have food and water for a month, I can weather this, but I cannot be alone, out here, in the dark without the ability to call friends and family for support while hes cozied up to his new woman a mere 5 days after telling me hes in love with me and wants to work on things. \n\nI did not want that relationship, it served me in some ways that I am grateful for but I am glad its over. In any other circumstance I would be fine but 3 days in bed too sick to even read less than 24 hours after that bomb led me to dwell in unhealthy ways and I simply cannot do another week of it. I just moved to this city 10 months ago and while I am grateful to have made 5 really amazing friends that are all prepared to host me and bring me to christmas dinner etc. if the weather turns, I simply don't know them well enough for it to be comfortable and not work (id be going to friends parents places etc.) The highway connecting me to my family is shut down. Both my mom and dad offered to fly me in but all the airports are closed... I live on my dream property in my dream city working my dream job with really incredibly kind new friends and I feel like im in a fucking prison. I know this is temporary and I have made it through a hell of a lot worse but holy doodle am I overwhelmed. \n\nAny comments on how he wont ultimately be happy in this and that my hard work of refusing the reprieve of online dating (because if I respect him Im not in a place to show up so thats not fare and if I respect me I wont date when Im not in a place to show up because it will end in shit connections) might actually be worth it or.... just anything to ease this discomfort.\n\nThanks for reading my story",

        "text": "So, I’ve been on and off the apps for the last several months, and I’ve met 3 guys that I feel like have the potential for something serious. My problem is, not one of them is really standing out to me above the others, and they all have something special about them that I like more than the others. I haven’t had exclusivity talks with any of them (one guy I’ve only been on one date with and the other two only a couple dates.) There has been lots of texting with all of them. I haven’t yet felt the need to disclose to them that I’ve gone on other dates, but I’m starting to feel like I’m being shady by talking to them all. To be honest, I think of them all as friends and haven’t really let myself fall for anyone yet, although I think I could. I do think that multi dating is preventing me from having stronger feelings for any one of them, since I’m not as focused. But, in the past I’ve been burned by putting all my eggs in one basket, so maybe this is somewhat of a defense mechanism. I don’t *want* to divide my attention, it’s not fair to the other person, and I don’t want to lie to anyone. \n\nThe problem is, I’m not sure which one (if any!) I want to commit to! I don’t feel like I know any of them well enough to commit, but I also feel like I can’t keep on multidating like this and be fair to them, and also maintain my sanity. \n\nI feel like I could “make it work” with any of them, and there are pros and cons with all, and that’s the hard part. I like them all as people and potential friends, and the idea of stopping talking to any of them makes me sad, because our potential has not yet been realized. It’s so hard having to make these decisions when only knowing a person for weeks or months. How do you choose someone to commit to these days when there are so many options with online dating? How do you know it’s time to stop multidating and choose?",

It was never your job to fix me. That was something I needed to figure out on my own and learn to forgive and heal for myself.

We were never a perfect couple but looking back at the person you are and how you loved me, and how we connected, things we had in common….

I don’t want you to think it had anything to do with who you are... And I’m sorry if I ever made you feel that way. You deserved better. I’ve done a lot of growing, and been through the ringer in a lot of ways. I’d like to think I’ve learned from my past mistakes. And I just hope you’re well.

I feel like he prioritizes other peoples feelings (ESPECIALLY other women) over mine. \n\nThe first incident happened early in our relationship where we were at a bar and he saw his ex’s friend and asked me to pretend to not be his gf so he wouldn’t hurt his ex’s feelings. I immediately wanted to end things because that was a massive red flag and he told me he loved me and begged for another chance.\n\nThere have been so many more examples of him willing to have my feelings hurt but not willing to hurt another woman. \n\nHis friends gf, my old work bully, was rolling her eyes at me and giving me that look (you know the look—the one that is intended to ostracize you for being weird) and ignoring the things I would say, or responding with “that’s weird” if I tried to make a joke. As a response, I no longer engage with her when she’s around aside from polite formalities and my bf is mad at ME for being rude to her. He says what she does is nbd.\n\nThere are so many other examples like this. And it sucks because he never responds to why he cares more about how they feel than I feel. I feel like because he never answers that, the cycle just keeps repeating itself. I’ve also never had so many issues with women before in my life. I’ve always been treated well by the women in my life and thought all the catty stuff you hear about was reserved for the movies. It feels like all the women in his life are so mean to me, and he just expects me to accept it with a smile so I don’t embarrass him. Sometimes I think it’s because the people in my life are all neurodivergent and his social circle is not. \n\nDoes anyone else deal with this?",

I don’t want to date someone and change them but at the same time I can’t seem to look past these things.

It just is so off putting for me because I feel like your time could be spent on much more productive things but at the same time I feel like who am I to make such a judgement? Also, it seems to be touted as such a normal habit. Is there anyone in a similar boat? I don’t know why I cannot shake this particular issue for me and feel like I have a warped view of relationships.

Our sex life has deteriorated. I’m just not interested in sex with him and I fantasize about having sex with other people. He frequents OnlyFans a lot and I feel like it’s a vicious cycle. He goes on OF because I’m not interested in sex, I’m not interested in sex because he goes on OF…\n\n3. He wants kids, I’m on the fence. I don’t know if I don’t want kids, or I don’t want kids with him…even though I think he’d make a pretty great dad.\n\n\n4. He’s a bit immature. Needs to be told explicitly everything to do in the house and he does it all but he’s not proactive. I feel like he never had to take care of himself and never grew up.\n\n\n\nThere are a million other variables but in short, I can’t help this feeling that our relationship has run it’s course and it’s time to call it. I feel like I’m still young, and I want to see what else is out there. I’m nervous about so many things changing… having to explain this to family and friends, having to take care of the house and the dogs on my own without his help, maybe that I’m making the wrong decision…\n\nWe are on the same page. We’re generally friendly and considerate of one another and agreed to take a break for the sake of our friendship. We’re not going to immediately divorce, and due to our financial situation we’re going to slowly work towards him moving out. (This is for both of our benefit; I make way more money than him and can stay in our apt very comfortably if he moves out, but he’s not in a position to take on another lease, etc…and at the same time I also work way more than him so I need him around to help with the dogs until I find a more permanent solution)\n\nAm I expecting too much? Is there such a thing as complete, consuming chemistry? Is Mr Right out there for me or should I be settling for Mr Good Enough?\n\nI want to be realistic, but I’m also a bit of a romantic…looking for insights, advice, experiences, reassurance…. Whatever you got!",

She's super smart and great company when I do get to spend time with her, but she has some severe (her words) untreated mental health issues that make her really unreliable and her moods unpredictable.\n\nI've grown used to her cancelling our plans and I usually still do whatever activity we were planning on my own. In fact whenever we make plans my default thinking is that \"it's not going to happen, but if it does then that will be a pleasant surprise\". But now I've reached a point where I just want to say \"ok, let me know when you've sorted out your life and are not constantly a mess anymore\". \n\nShe's not seeking treatment for her health issues (diagnosed many years ago - one condition is being treated with medication but she's not taking it reliably). She drinks too much and recently lost her job due to being unreliable (not turning up, and going no contact with her colleagues and manager. I know her manager, and the guy is a saint!). She usually deflects when I ask her if she's taking steps to get treatment (she mentioned her intention to do so earlier this year), and I just don't know how to deal with it anymore. What can I possibly say to her? I'd really love some advice.",

        "text": "I (33F) am part Ukrainian (I emigrated from Ukraine as a teenager) and live in a small village with my husband and 8 month old daughter. I recently met a Ukrainian woman (30F) through a local fundraiser who thankfully managed to leave Ukraine after the war. She also has a 12 month old son so we’ve been spending time together, going for coffee, shopping and I have helped her and her husband with translating, registering with doctors, attending appointments, applying for social housing and just generally getting settled in. \n\nWhile I did initially enjoy spending time with her, I’m starting to feel a bit uncomfortable, almost that she’s coming on too strong? She calls and texts me every morning, and wants to spend all day together, having coffee and going into shops in our town. Sometimes she asks me to help her with something (which I’m happy to do) but then presents it as an emergency that only I can help her with (often it’s something like transferring money, returning parcel etc). Our town has a pretty great support system for Ukrainians, but she dismisses it and says that she doesn’t really find it helpful and doesn’t find anything in common with other Ukrainians. She also keeps buying me things (coffee, pastries, hats from charity shops) even though I told her multiple times that I DO NOT feel comfortable with this, but then she gets quite offended if I don’t accept. I know that this is her way of thanking me for the things I help her with but I’m happy to help her without the additional gifts (which I told her). \n\nOn the days when I make it clear that I’m busy with other things (running errands or spending time with family or other friends), she still calls me and texts me relentlessly asking if we can still see each other that day. When she comes to my house for coffee she then stays all day which stops me from doing other things too. Once I told her that I’ll be out with another friend, she called me and said that she was in front of my house and wanted to drop off some vitamins she bought for me and some homemade muffins. She left those in front of my door. This is incredibly sweet but also made me feel uncomfortable. I tried inviting her to the things I like to do (meeting other friends; baby groups etc) but she’s not interested. \n\nI’m now visiting my parents in another country. We’ve come for a month (with my daughter and husband) as we haven’t seen them for three years. Yet I’m still getting texts like ‘can you please look at this form that we have to fill in’ and when I didn’t respond within 2 hours it’s ‘I miss you already’, ‘why are you not responding / Is everything okay? I’m worried’. Maybe I’m busy spending time with my family?? \n\nI know that what she has gone through was incredibly traumatic and I want to support her as much as I can. My father is from Ukraine too and we still have family there. I understand that she wants to make new connections/support network in a new town and I’m happy to help her in any way I can (and I try to as much as I can) to make her feel settled and supported. However I don’t want to have a disingenuous friendship and I find the intensity with which this friendship is progressing a bit too much. I’m almost dreading coming back and feeling that intensity/discomfort again. \n\nHow would you navigate this situation in the most sensitive way possible? \n\nThank you so much for reading!",

So I will try my luck with this one and hope you have also some smart answers.\nPlease bear with me for the longer text. \nIt needs a bit of context to understand, I guess.\n\nI met a new friend a few months ago. We immediately clicked although a few things were a bit weird. I could not pin it down. \n\nAll was well until she had a session with a coach/therapist (?). \nWe used to send each other a few longer voice messages before, which had gotten a habit during travels and the fact that we wanted to keep each other updated. \n\nLong story short, after that session I had sent her another longer voice message. She responded with several shorter messages at once, which almost totaled to the same amount of time. One said, she had this session and at the moment she cannot cope with long voice messages.\n\nI responded back, basically, with ok, I understand, but I don’t understand how several short messages make a difference to one long message. \n\nI kid you not, she flipped. What came after was her sending me voice message after voice message with repetitive content telling me she does not appreciate us talking with each other like that and we should talk in love with each other. And I repeatedly said, no worries, all good, I just found it funny that several short messages are better than one with the same amount of time. \n\nShe would not stop until I stopped responding. After a few days she came back to me with „do you want to talk about this?“ \nMy inner voice was like „hell no! This was not enough talking about this BS yet?!“.\n\nI can’t bring myself to speaking, responding or doing anything towards her direction, because I always feel like I will get a tornado back. It feels incredibly toxic to me. \n\nWhen I told her, that it is not a big deal for me, she told me I invalidate her feelings. Yeah right. And if I say it is not so important for me to talk about it, it’s not valid? \n\nYou get the picture. \n\nAnd this demand of needing to speak with each other from a place of love. Yikes. As if you can command love? \n\nAll my senses yell RUN. \nHowever, I can’t get rid of this feeling of wanting to put a closure somehow. Knowing there will probably never be one of the discussion goes like this…\n\nWhat would you do?",

        "text": "I left my job in september due to mental and physical burnout.  Last year I developed a lot of unexplainable conditions, including vomiting water.  It's been rough and ultimately, I realized I need to quit my job and figure this out.   So after quitting, I found an airbnb cabin and moved there for 2 months. \n\nMiraculously I found an eastern medicine doctor here whose treatment plan has given me hte most hope in 2 years.  So I decided to stay and saw a few sublets including L's and asked the airbnb owner if we could work something out.  The owner said she would but had to think on it and I knew L was on a time crunch, so I told her not to wait for me.   Turns out the airbnb owner dragged out everything, leaving me in limbo, until finally she came back with an offer that was much higher than my offer.   Add to it, problems with the oven and water, that she doesn't address. \n\nI reached out to L who unfortunately had already rented her place out, but she texted me this morning to offer me her very small one room basement airbnb.  It's big enough to hold one queen size bed only (no other furniture) and is pretty dark with one door window only.  Not ideal for someone who is prone to depression and is trying to destress in the cold winter, but better than nothing.  So, I said I would take it.   \n\nThat's when my doctor reached out and said she'd be willing to offer me her airbnb apt at a reduced rate.  In addition to windows, it's most of the things I'm looking for.  Nature views and bigger than a small room.  \n\nSo after sitting on it a few hours, I decided to renege and texted L to tell her.  L hasn't text me back yet, but the people pleaser feels just awful. Absolutely awful. She's been so thoughtful and kind and here I am letting her down AGAIN.  \n\nIt's also a small town and my doctor and L know each other as neighbors and are friendly.  (not sure they're actually friends though).   So I'm concerned I'm messing up their relationship as well.  \n\nI know I'm a people-pleaser and technically I'm not in the wrong.  No papers signed, no money exchanged, but am I overreacting?  \n\nAnd regardless, of technicalities, I'd like to make this right somehow. I can't afford to pay L's place as well - is there another way to make this right?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**tl/dr:** health and burnout forced me to quit my job.  I came out to a small town and found help, Decided to stay and got caught in a snafu as I looked for a place to extend my stay.  In the process, had to turn down L once and then later reneged on L when she tried to help me out of my snafu. her place was tiny and dark and I'm prone to depression and have mental burnout, but i took it thinking I had no other option.  The same day, someone else offered me a place that isn't tiny and dark, so I took it and reneged on L.  No money or papers exchanged.  But I feel awful.  I always keep my word and I'm reneging on someone who's been kind to me.  Plus, this is a small town and L and the other person know each other, so I hate that I might be complicating their relationship.  I know, I'm probably overreacting, but how much am I overreacting?  And even if it's not necessary, how can I make this better?",

I have a few guy friends who I have been friends with for a long time, some are from work who no longer work there though but we've remained friends and all play online games together.\n\nI feel like I need to act as if I could be \"available\" to date and even like \"helpless\" in a cute way  \nif I want to be friends with them or by extension if I need help with something. I don't know how to explain it. Help could include being driven to pick up something large for my place, having someone come over to look at something to fix (after I try myself first and fail and landlord is useless) etc. Sometimes I even just want company and a friend to watch a movie with. \n\nAnyway, today is my birthday, and one of my friends, Kevin, who I know has been head over heels for me for a while now (who knows I'm not looking for a serious relationship right now) texted me at exactly midnight to say happy birthday, I asked him if he was just staring at the time waiting to be the first to say it and he was like \"not staring but yeah haha 😝\" and I was really annoyed by this because Kevin is super clingy, submissive, and kind of a wiener. If we've hung out all day, he's the type to not mention to me he's hungry. He'll go the entire day not eating until I ask if he's hungry to which point he frantically says yes and just stares at me. Like okay? What are you going to do about that?? Anyway. So I responded to his text \"Jesus lol\" and he said \"what??\" I didn't bother responding because I was annoyed.\n\nAnyway so I message him back just now saying \"nothing lol so how are you\" and he's giving me short answers now, presumably because he's mad or upset that I wasn't like \"hehee so cute thank you!!\"\n\nI don't really know what I'm ranting about. I'm just annoyed. Because anytime I need help from a friend, it feels like I have to act all cutesy and flirty and hang out with them for a while after the favour is done otherwise I'm just “using\" them.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like this?",

        "text": "I’m 33 and admit I’ve had a rough lot in life caused by years of depression, horrid jobs, feeling lost throughout my 20s. Then I went back to school at 30 to start a career in tech. I’m not passionate about it but am content enough. I’ve worked my ass off but still haven’t been able to secure a full time job. I have had to live at home as a result of not having money and blowing through money on unpaid internships. Luckily over the past year I’ve at least been able to afford therapy and drugs to get myself to a place of feeling ok daily and sometimes even hopeful. I even have some dreams now that get me feeling good daily and so I do feel great most of the time now. I feel like things should be falling into place but they’re not. Still single, still don’t have the career I want, still don’t have the exciting life I want. I’ve worked my ass off but it’s not enough. Then I see people just gliding into exactly what I want. Getting a good job their first time around, marrying someone with family money who can just take their kid to music festivals all day since the husband is a bookie (yes actually know someone like this). Yet I’ve worked super hard for a career and to get myself to the place where I’m confident and hopeful. Yet I’m still single, without a family, and don’t have the career/respect I want. Nothing is falling into place for me, why?",

        "text": "I always considered myself a person with a super high sex drive, in an ideal world I’ll have sex 10 times a week. \n\nHowever, since I’ve been with my new partner - whom I find very beautiful and attractive (since may of this year) ans Who’s very considerate and loving in all the ways and on top of it 10 years younger (so all the stamina I have ever dreamed of), my libido went from sky high and plummeted to virtually 0. \n\nI can’t get wet enough, sex has become unbearably painful, I barely masturbate anymore and when I think of my vulva and vagina I feel a dark nothingness. \n\nI am actually panicking and upset. This was a somewhat slow process but I started feeling the foreboding since summer but it got more notaeable now because we’re also long distance and didn’t see each other for almost 1,5 months. That’s enough time to really horn up and be ready for some intimate time. we did it once and the second day he got my warmed up but once he wanted to penetrate I froze in pain and realized I was dry as an old bread. \n\nWTF IS HAPPENING - I am 34F and need advice from women. Please send help, words of advice, experiences. I am heartbroken and feel like I lost a huge part of my identity with my low sex drive. I also don’t want to lose my partner - sex is important to both of us.",
