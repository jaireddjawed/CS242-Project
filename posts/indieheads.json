If the album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two albums are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple albums tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.\n\n# Bubbling Under\n\nHighest albums outside of the Top 50 that have never entered the Top 50 Chart\n\n|Rank|Album|Points|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|51|Kate NV - WOW|46|\n|53|My Chemical Romance - Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge|46|\n|57|Waxahatchee - Cerulean Salt|43.5|\n|58|Sudan Archives - Natural Brown Prom Queen|43.5|\n|60|Beach House - Teen Dream|42.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Personal Chart of the Week\n\nOne of the joys some people have on the chart is seeing their own impact on the chart. Whether its seeing your #1 album at #1, or seeing it bubbling under, people like seeing songs they like being adored by other users.

If the album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two albums are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple albums tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.\n\n# Personal Chart of the Week\n\nOne of the joys some people have on the chart is seeing their own impact on the chart. Whether its seeing your #1 album at #1, or seeing it bubbling under, people like seeing songs they like being adored by other users. In this section, one lucky chart participant will see their own chart and the impact it had on the full chart this week. This week, we have the chart of u\/RandomHypnotica\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Rank|Album|Their Points|Actual Rank|Total Points|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|SZA - SOS|15.0|\\#10|181|\n|2|The Aces - Always Get This Way|14.0|\\#362|14.0|\n|3|Tove Lo - Borderline (single)|13.0|\\#474|13.0|\n|4|Full Tac - Where's My Juul?|12.0|\\#590|12.0|\n|5|RAYE - My 21st Century Blues|11.0|\\#39|54.5|\n|6|Lana Del Rey - Norman Fucking Rockwell|10.0|\\#77|34.5|\n|7|NewJeans - Ditto|9.0|\\#196|19.0|\n|8|Alvvays - Blue Rev|7.5|\\#9|212.5|\n|8|Clairo - Immunity|7.5|\\#214|18.0|\n|10|Jessie Ware - What's Your Pleasure?|5.5|\\#1360|5.5|\n|10|Slayyyter - Slayyyter|5.5|\\#1360|5.5|\n\nLooking for new, lesser-known music?

If the album occupies that user's #1 spot in their individual chart, it receives 15 points, then 14 points for #2, so on and so forth until 6 points for #10. If there is a tie, which is a common occurrence, then the number of points is averaged across those positions, e.g. if two albums are tied for #1, both will receive 14.5 points. Oftentimes there will be multiple albums tied for the last place, in which case the number of points each song receives decreases until it bottoms out at 1 point each.\n\n# Personal Chart of the Week\n\nOne of the joys some people have on the chart is seeing their own impact on the chart. Whether its seeing your #1 album at #1, or seeing it bubbling under, people like seeing songs they like being adored by other users. In this section, one lucky chart participant will see their own chart and the impact it had on the full chart this week.

H-Y-P-E: Friends, go get it!\n\nYeah, welcome back to **Hype Thursday,** a place where you can post music.  Imagine.\n\n# Rules: \n\nShare artists and bands who've never gotten had a post on r\/indieheads break 50 upvotes.  (Features count, but, for instance, a brief mention in a newspost, interview, or listicle doesn't.)  \n\n# Formatting:\n\n>Artist - Song Title\n\n>Description: Where are they from?  What do they do?  Who do they hang with, and what do they sound like?  No character minimum, no hard rules\u2014just tell us what makes these artists so great.\n\n##Example (c\/o u\/JJMurphys)\n\n> Half Hexagon - [Ism](https:\/\/halfhexagon.bandcamp.com\/album\/half-hexagon-ep?t=2)\n\n> Half Hexagon are a band from Auckland NZ, featuring members of Na Noise and Lawrence Arabia. Krautrock inspired, upbeat synths, phased vocals. Sounds old while still sounding fresh.\n\n# Other Guidelines\/Recommendations\n\n* If you post a song, **listen to another song and comment on it.**  Please.  The whole thread runs on give and take, and there's gold to be had here.\n* **We strongly recommend posting Bandcamp links, if possible.**  Your comments won't be removed if you post Spotify or Apple Music links, but this is a thread about smaller artists, and it's been proven repeatedly that Bandcamp supports small artists more than any other streaming service\/online music marketplace.\n* Keep in mind--**This isn't a general \"give me recommendations\" or \"can anyone help me find this album\" thread.**  That sort of thing belongs in the Daily Music Discussion.\n* **The r\/Indieheads rules for submitting original music apply to this thread.**  This isn't a self-promo thread,  but semi-regular indieheads are allowed to share their projects.  Otherwise, mods will remove your comments, and repeat offenders may be subject to a ban.\n\nConcept and rules adapted from u\/ReconEG.  Additional gratitude to u\/apondalifa.  Hype Thursday will return March 23rd.  Bandcamp Friday is March 3rd.  The Ides of March are March 15th.
