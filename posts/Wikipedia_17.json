        "text": "Primarily working from a telephone carrier due to personal circumstances, IP blocked because presumably thousands of others using it and a few probably made edits to ruin pages. Request and get an account, make a few edits... someone asks me for a favour to put in some harmless edits on a page because they can't. So I did, as it seemed reasonable. Next thing I know, I am blocked as a sockpuppet.\n\nLiterally none of the edits I've made would constitute vandalism but because I'm supposedly a sockpuppet I am instantly getting booted and banned every time I try and get a rational explanation. I'm at the point I'm considering gorcing the issue by making a sockpuppet account of me own to demand an explanation on the administrators noticeboard. I really don't like thinking this way but the general attitude is just crap. Multiple UTRS appeald denied without any explanation, my talk page access revoked, and when I tried to get some help over IRC they said \"sorry we csnt help you because if we give you details of checkuser we could be giving away someones personal info, you may just be collateral damage and we are OK with that\"\n\nIt makes me want to punch someone in the face for the sheer stupidity of it. I keep seeing this one particular admin named Yamla who sticks his head in and shuts everything down without hearing me out. They keep screaming \"checkuser\" ignoring the fact I'm on a data carrier IP that is shared with literally thousands if not millions of other users.\n\nI did some digging on the user I supposedly am a sockpuppet of and tbh it looks like even they weren't really doing anything wrong, they just got frustrated dealing with the byzantine unblock process and tried to go their own way. Literally the only reason they are currently blocked is just for repeatedly making new accounts to circumvent a block for... you guessed it, circumventing their block. None of their contributions are harmful, they are all fairly benign but they still got reverted.\n\nReally don't get it at all. Any advice? I tried being rational but they are stonewalling me at every step.",
