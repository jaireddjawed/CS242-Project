Always heard that these sauces taste better as leftovers. The recipe says that the sauce keeps for up to a week, but here's the big twist.\n\nI'm adding a bunch of meat. I have a rack of baby back ribs, a couple of short ribs, and a package of hot Italian sausage I plan on braising in it (I'm also going to pick up some meatballs from a good butcher but plan on adding those at the end). Also, I'm planning on removing all the meat and serving it separately so that people that don't want to eat a bunch of meat have that option.\n\nSo my questions are:  \n-Say I were to make the sauce with the meat tonight or tomorrow, and pull the meat out, to reheat Sunday. Will the meat get gross by than? It'd basically have to sit in the fridge in a ziploc bag, and than I think I'd throw back in on Sunday  to reheat it.\n\n-The meats all take a little bit different times to braise. Should I take them out after they are \"done\" to avoid overcooking, or does it not really matter?\n\n-Any temperature risk transporting the sauce in a pot in the car all day Saturday? We're looking at about a 6 hour drive in the Northeast.\n\n-Am I overthinking all of this and should just make it all Sunday Morning?\n\nAppreciate any input.",

The one thing that's giving me pause is the plastic helper handle. After looking at Kenji's wok videos, there are noticeable burns on the helper handle. Flare ups tend to be somewhat inevitable on gas stoves as seen in his recent [late night dan dan noodle video](https://youtu.be/XcTNQwj6lHo?t=2m2s), and I even experience the same thing on my cast iron skillet when I'm sauteing.

It‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs favorite cut, and I want to blow his socks off and make the best he‚Äôs ever had. I have a couple questions though. \n\n- His recipe says to cut the oven off when it reaches an internal temp of 120/125F. I thought fat doesn‚Äôt render until 130F? I am a medium rare girl and my husband is more of a medium guy, but will go MR for prime rib. What temp reaches that wonderful melted fat rendered sweet spot without being overcooked?\n\n- I think my oven only goes to 500F, how long would you say the sear portion lasts? Is it just to visual doneness? \n\n- Do you let the meat come to room temp before starting or does it matter?\n\n- He just suggests salt and pepper for the exterior. Anyone add anything else? We love garlic, but not sure how it would do in this case. \n\n- I am thinking about cold smoking the prime rib with Hickory pellets the day before making it, wrapping it up and letting it rest overnight. Has anyone cold smoked it before? How did it turn out?\n\nThanks for the input! \n",

The amount of salt in the marinade (1/4 cup) was too much for me, and I absolutely love salt. The amount of lemon juice (3/4 cup) also seemed to be a bit off and it actually became the primary note coming through on the dish. This is not as big of a deal for me, but there seemed to be a couple of typos in the recipe itself, which I'm not used to seeing with Kenji recipes that have over 50 reviews (the ingredient list mentions 3 tablespoons of ginger but the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons + 2 tablespoons; the ingredient list mentions 12 cloves of garlic but the recipe has you use 8 cloves for 1 step and then the \"remaining 4 tablespoons\" in another).

I've read the Serious Eats recipe and I have been trying to tweak it slightly to get perfectly tender, cut with a fork brisket that still holds together. I've done a few samples:\n\nAt 275 I went about 1 hour per pound and it came out a little tough. You couldn't cut through with a fork, needed a knife.\n\nAt 225 I went about 1.5 hour per pound, and it came out tasty, however it was too tender - The pieces were kind of falling apart.\n\nThe rest of my process is: I season, sear, brown celery, carrots, onions, garlic -deglaze that with red wine, throw in a can of diced tomatoes, a bunch of seasoning, some soy sauce and worcester, some beef stock. Then let the brisket cook in the liquid. When its done, I remove all vegetables except for the carrots and blend them with the liquid, then cook that down into a sauce.\n\nI'm trying to knock this out of the park as I'm taking over the holiday brisket from my grandma and serving to the whole family.\n\nI'm thinking maybe I'll meet in the middle on the temperature? I'm wondering, from a science standpoint, how low is too low, and how long is too long to cook? If I kept it at 275 and just cooked for longer, what would my result be?\n\nMy last issue was seasoning: In my tests, I didnt get a good season on the brisket. Once it went into the liquid, I felt it lost all the seasoning. I also trim the fat off the top after cooking, so any seasoning on the fat doesnt make it in. This time, I am seasoning the day before so it can hopefully absorb the seasoning more. Would it make sense to maybe cut some of the fat like a flap, and then season it, and then place the fat back on top?\n\nAny tips and help would be appreciated",

I was really nervous and followed the instructions very closely, never leaving the mixer. \n\nThen I started getting cocky when my initial attempts were so successful. I started walking away from the mixer during the kneading steps, and doing other things around the kitchen. I thought letting the mixer go for a little while on its own could not hurt anything. I was wrong. My breads have been much tougher and denser.\n\nThen in this article I discovered a truth that was not adequately driven home during my early pizza research. Don't over-knead the dough.",

I want to make her some chocolate candies, since milk chocolate is out the window for several weeks. I do have lactose free milk and cream, but when I try searching for chocolate candy recipes everything either wants you to use milk chocolate chips or bars, or else it has you using milk powder and cocoa butter. Is there no happy medium where you can make some form of hard chocolate using cream or milk? I'm trying to either make a filled chocolate or even just a plain bar of say, orange and milk chocolate. Any help would be appreciated. I've googled for hours but pretty much just keep stumbling on to vegan chocolate as my only option. Can't find anything on seriouseats or in The Food Lab, but figured you fellow serious eats followers might have an idea.\n\nedit: she hates dark chocolate, or this would be easy. :(\n\nedit again: I will keep a log and update you all if I end up having to do experiments\n\nOkay, I played with what I had on hand to try to make a truffle. \n50g bourneville dark chocolate\n8g butter\nmelted those over water, then slowly whisked in a 36% fat lactose free cream. It was okay at 45ml, but had that bitter dark chocolate taste and I didn't want to push it too far.\nI added 1 teaspoon of icing sugar which helped a lot.\nI remembered I had some valencia orange extract so put in 1ml of that, and now it tastes like a terry's chocolate orange, kind of, which she loves. \n\nI have it in the fridge to cool to see what consistency it reaches when it does. I did find some chocolate sprinkles that are fodmap compliant, so if worst comes to worst and I can make a decent truffle, I'm sure she'll be happy. However, now I feel like I'm on a mission lol.\n\n ",
