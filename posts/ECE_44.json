My main question is why under light loading does the supply go into DCM if the output current is so small?  Maybe I am thinking of it wrong but I can't seem to wrap my head around how a lower current output would cause the inductor current to drop to 0.\n\n",

You have the big generic tools like Encounter from vendors like Cadence, smaller private vendors who give specialized licenses, and then proprietary software developed internally to do things like convert filetypes, handle UVM/OVM stuff, and manage bug reporting, code coverage, or TCL/Perl scripts.\n\nI'm wondering how established engineers handle these software differences when moving between companies. I am currently involved in validation which primarily uses tools and scripts, both with vendor tools and internal stuff. With big tools like Cadence or Synopsys products, I can understand how general knowledge can be easily applied between companies because the variations in delivered product between companies aren't significant. If I put Cadence Encounter in my resume or ask at an interview it's implicitly expected I can understand how to do P&amp;R, power rails, density analysis, etc with Encounter.\n\nBut as the software gets proprietary it's not like companies will be doing the same thing in different ways. Company A may be using an OVM wrapper class that does PCIe stimulus, while company B may have a vendor tool that applies PCIe stimulus in a different way. Doesn't this mean that moving between companies always requires unlearning and learning, and if so, wouldn't that make switching between companies difficult from a job role knowledge perspective since you'll always be tied to knowing \"one companies method\"?",

If so, then we should be able to produce more power if we have a material that can carry more current.\n\nCarbon nanotubes are such a material. In tests they can carry orders of magnitude more current than ordinary conductors such as copper, aluminum, or gold. The problem is they've only be able to be produced for short lengths, a few centimeters at most.\n\nBut an interesting research on nanotube-copper composites showed that can carry a 100 times more current than standard copper. So for the same size electric motor we could produce 100 times more power than currently:\n\nPosted: Aug 06, 2013\nNovel CNT-copper nanocomposite delivers a 100-fold increase in current density\nhttp://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=31710.php\n\nFor the Tesla that would not be as major a deal because of the small size of the motor at only about 32 kilos for the Tesla S, in a vehicle that weighs thousands of kilos.\n\nBut that would be major for large scale motors used in other scenarios. These can weigh thousands of kilos, and could then be reduced to only tens of kilos. It would also be especially important for proposed electric aircraft that many groups are working towards.\n\nSo is it really true we can increase electric motor power levels simply by using wire of higher current capacity?",

On the other hand I feel staying lower level has more job security? Anyway, can anyone shine some light on me and some different perspectives? Thanks.",

I'm a Physics student and since my school had mandatory 'specialization' courses in the last two semesters -you choose a subfield you're interested in, it's not a Masters degree- I chose Electronics and Telecommunications. I'm interested in these anyway and plan on pursuing a Master's offered by my school called Radioelectrology - basically, circuit electronics, computers and telecom engineering. \n\nI'm currently also developing games in my spare time, and the whole industry interests me a lot, so I'd like to make my degree relevant to that field and computer engineering in general. I'm especially interested in one day building my own console or at least knowing how they work and taking them apart. So, my specialization group offers two extra lessons: Digital System Design and Computer Architecture. The respective books are 'Fundamentals of Digital Logic with VHDL Design' by Brown-Vranesic and a lesser known book about CA called 'Computer Architecture' by professor Dimitrios Nikolos. In case you don't know it, it covers **Structure, Organization, Function and Performance of Computers**, **Data Management inside the Computer**, **Central Processing Unit**,**Memory Systems**,**Input/Output** and **Modern Processors** (basically it seems like a good primer). Now, the syllabus doesn't even include half of the topics covered, so what I want to know is if it would be worth spending the summer to go beyond the covered topics. Any good books you could suggest would also be helpful. Thank you!",

Essentially, I have an old speaker enclosure and I'm building the electronics portion with new parts.\n\nThe amp section i chose is a Velleman 7W amp kit from Jameco.\nThe schematic for this amp can be found at: http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/127255.pdf\n\nAlso, to fit in with the design of the old amp, I wanted to add a tremolo circuit. I decided to go with the EA tremolo from runoffgroove:\nhttp://www.home-wrecker.com/EAtremolo.png\n\nThe amplifier works by itself (plug a guitar into the input, speaker hooked to the output), and the tremolo works by itself (like a regular tremolo guitar effect pedal). *But*, when i chain the two together (guitar -&gt; tremolo -&gt; amplifier), it seems like the tremolo overloads the amp. All that comes out of the speaker is a super loud hum/buzz.\n\n**How can I get these two working together? Could it be an issue of input/output impedance between the two sections?**\n\nI tried using a Fetzer valve between the two (thinking that might help match the impedance?) but the result with all three chained was that it didn't make any noise at all. It's a possibility that I didn't build the FV correctly, but I  wasn't sure how to test it on its own and at least double checked my breadboarding for it.\n\nThe FV i went with: http://runoffgroove.com/fetzervalve.png\n\n**Any thoughts on what might be the next steps to figuring this out?**",

I have a 500KHz sine wave that will vary in amplitude from 1 Vpp to 0 Vpp. I designed an 'ideal diode' circuit using a fast switching diode and a 10MHz op-amp, but it seems like the rise time of the op-amp is not fast enough to actually charge the capacitor to the maximum peak value. I have some 50MHz op-amps on order, so I'm going to test those tomorrow to see if that helps.\n\nI also tried adding a DC offset to the sine wave, and rectifying this through a diode and into a capacitor, since the output goes into a high impedance source, I'm assuming the voltage drop across the diode should be pretty consistent, so I can calibrate the offset in software. I do see that the voltage drop changes over temperature, so I added a second diode in the circuit that has current flowing into a 1 mega-ohm load, so I can then read the voltage drop of this diode, and I should be able to offset any temperature changes in software.\n\nMy last idea is using one of those RF RMS to DC converters, but most of them start working from about 10MHz, I did find a few that start at 100KHz, but the DC voltage/dB slope was not completely linear, so this is not a perfect solution either.\n\nCurrently I have no idea what circuit will fix my problem. I need to get the peak voltage of a sine wave, and I need it accurately. Sampling directly with an ADC is not a possibility unfortunately.\n\nI hope some of you might have an idea, or could steer me in the right direction!",

Is it from some type of counter hardware?\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I'm curious as to *how* a computer can just come up with the right voltages/logic levels in memory to represent a number like 143 out of the blue. This was something which was never covered in my digital logic class. One lab assignment required a \"hard coded constant\" value of I believe 243, which we set with multiple wires in parallel hooked to the respective voltages to represent 243. I'm curious as to how a computer can just come up with the right logic levels in the right places\n\nEDIT2: Thank you to everyone for your variety and depth of answers! I'm really blown away by all the attention this thread has gotten. I think I can see now the error in my thinking; from what I've learned it makes sense that a \"load immediate\" or equivalent instructions would simply forward the binary value being stored in the program (i.e. the rest of the opcode) and simply forward those bits to the correct register, thus \"obtaining\" this arbitrary number without needing some other sort of hardware to just come up with it.",

However, surely the quantity measured is the current (or, given a fix R and no L or C components is equivalent to V)?\n\nGiven that current is a function of carrier velocity, and the E-field causes acceleration, you need to integrate the received E-field/signal over time. This gives a -cos(wt) + c. Given boundary conditions of E =0, I = 0 -&gt; c= +1. According to this logic, the received and generated signal are out of phase (-cos vs sin), and also the current (from the +1) never goes below 0 i.e. the current never moves in the opposite direction.\n\n2). On Tx, I don't see this problem as the generation of EM fields is proportional to acceleration, so you just apply an E field, it accelerates the charges leading to EM generation, and the resulting signal is in phase.\n\n3.) Side question - diagrams of EM propagation show the E/B fields sinusoidally moving in space - bigger deviation from 0 means higher E/B values. Obviously this can't be \"real space\" - the amplitude is not a measure of how wide a beam is (otherwise couldn't get high power concentrated lasers). But this amplitude is still related to real space (hence polarization). How does this work? Is amplitude something like |E|n, where n is a unit vector?\n\nThanks! ",

From fixing computer issues for family, to piecing together my own custom built PC's, I've always been on the computer since I was a child.\n\nFor a long time, I even ran a graphics design website. I loved using Photoshop as a kid (I was like 10-13 when I was doing this) and was learning very basic coding to put together Forum skins and website templates by myself through tutorials I'd find online. The website itself was a forum dedicated to helping people new to graphics design get started, and I absolutely hate myself for ever letting go of this hobby. More than 13 years ago I was managing something I enjoyed so much and as much as I hate to say it, feel like I led myself out of this hobby to appear less of a geek, which I now understand is complete BS and really feel I led myself out of my true calling.\n\nMy biggest concern is the complete lack of overlap. A degree in IT can be paired with my experience but I just don't think it'd do much to change my career path; I'd still be auditing.\n\nI'm looking into registering a class or two at my local CC this fall but in the mean time would love to learn as much as I can to help determine if this is the right path for me.\n\nLocated in Chicago btw.\n\nThank you all!",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm creating a system that reads a barcode using the USB_HID_Keyboard example program within Harmony. \n\nThe issue is, when I use a barcode reader instead of an actual keyboard, it doesn't connect. I have figured out that this only occurs when the USART is intialised.\n\nOther things that work:\n\nPutting a normal keyboard in first, then replacing with a barcode reader.\n\nDeinitialising the USART\n\nDelaying the program using a for loop within the \"Waiting for attach\" state - Problem is this blocks the program.\n\nAnybody had a similar situation and found a solution in the past?\n\nThanks.",
