        "text": "Several years ago, I was driving home from work to get my wallet that I had forgotten, when a police officer standing at the side of the road doing a construction detail waved me over and stopped me. He said that he'd seen me come the wrong way out of a one-way side street, which I hadn't come out of and which isn't one way. I was polite, nodded, and he said he'd need to see my license and registration. I gave him the registration and apologized saying I was going home to get my wallet actually because I just realized I didn't have it, but I was happy to show him my work badge, work bag and handheld device full of things with my info on them, and I was happy to wait if he wanted to run my license. He gave me a bunch of attitude about how I could have had anyone's car and work stuff, and if I really lived a few miles away, why didn't I know that the street was a one-way? I stayed polite, he eventually told me to \"get out of here and I don't want to see you driving around here pulling this kind of crap.\"\n\nAbout three years later, working at a job with kids with disabilities, I had this sweet little kid with the sweetest mom and dad, who donated time and money to our program, constantly brought the staff coffee, and were just the nicest parents ever, and I kept thinking I knew the dad from somewhere, but couldn't place him. I would periodically try and make small talk to see if we'd gone to the same college, or used to live in the same neighborhood, or anything like that, but couldn't figure it out. Then one day he mentioned that he was a police officer and worked in the neighborhood where the not-actually-one-way street was, and I realized where I knew him from.",

        "text": "I'm not a great writer, but I shared this story in a comment on PnS and wanted to share it here as well. \n\nSome background: I went to college with the intention of going into law enforcement. It's what I've wanted to do for as long as I can remember. I got a bachelor's in Criminal Justice and went through COPs (Collegiate Officer Program) after my second year in college. After many applications and no returned calls, I decided I needed to find a better job than Walmart for at least the time being and went to work in Child Protective Services. \n\nAs I don't have the ability to go full time now, I've been talking with a local department and will be reserving with them as soon as I can find a reserve class. As such, the chief arranged for me to ride with one of the night shift guys. It's a small department with only 3 full time officers and the chief. There are some other reserve officers as well, but that's basically it. This wasn't my first ride along, but it was my first with this department. In the past, I had always been told to stay in the vehicle and just observe. \n\nMy first night out riding with this officer he gives me the rundown. \"If I get into a foot pursuit with someone, you're either running with me or you're keeping an eye on whoever else is in the vehicle.\" When I sat in the unit, there was a shotgun sitting in the seat that I had to move in order to sit. \"You comfortable with using that thing?\" He asked me as he pointed to the shotgun. \"Yes, sir,\" I responded, expecting I wouldn't ever even need to touch it. \"Okay, well if something goes down, go to work.\" I train pretty regularly with firearms as a personal hobby and went through firearms training with the Collegiate Officer Program, so I was definitely comfortable with using a gun, but highly doubted the probability of having to do so. \n\nAfter a few hours of driving around and working traffic stops, we receive a call about a door alarm at a store in town. According to the officer, these are always going off for no reason whatsoever. He decides to have some fun and runs code part of the way to the call. \"Never run code to a call where there might be a break in\" he says as he laughs. He stops running code when we are still a good distance from the store. We arrive at the store and that's when we see it: the front door has been shattered out. \"Oh shit, it's real.\" The officer gets out of the car and I follow suit. \"Grab that shotgun.\" Well, so much for never having to grab it. \n\nWe wait for another officer to get to the scene and the three of us clear the building, them with their sidearms and me with the shotgun. I had always wondered what my response would be to a situation like that. Would I be scared? Nervous? To my surprise, I felt calm. The only thing on my mind was clearing this store and doing so effectively and safely. It turns out, the would be robbers broke out the front door and ran off as the alarm went off. There was no one in the store. But that night solidified it for me: this is definitely something I want to do. ",

        "text": "Hi, everyone, it's been a long time since I posted anything.  Remembered a good story that I thought I had actually already posted about.  This is a pretty good one, and it involves a cop who doesn't like when people waste his time.\n\nThis was a long time ago. I was only a few years out of high school. 2nd or 3rd year apprentice. I had a job working in a sheet metal shop, and driving the delivery truck. Because of the work, I had bulked up from high school, and was cruising around at about 235 lbs. Big, young kid.\n\nI was driving back from making a delivery in the company truck. It was a 2500 series GMC. Unloaded, it had stupid torque.  You could probably pull tree stumps with this thing.  I was leaving a job site in a sketchy part of town, making my way back to the highway.  I'm in the left lane, and I need to get to my right. There's a spot, and I put on my signal.  Then the jackhole in the right lane speeds up, and tries to block me.  Screw that. Put foot down, and truck leaps forward and I change lanes.  Guy is giving me the finger. I don't give a shit, I'm trying to get back to the shop for lunch.  I pull up to the next stop light, and the fucker HITS ME.  Gives me the finger again.  But I have a secret weapon. This doesn't anger me whatsoever, because it is a work truck, and I'm on somebody else's dime.  But I do need to check the vehicle and get his insurance information.\n\nSo, I hop out of the truck with a clipboard and go to look at the back of the truck.  I hear footsteps and turn around in time to hear \"How do you like me now you little fuck\" and the old guy *takes a swing at me*.  I say he took a swing at me, not he punched me, because this guy telegraphed it so early, that I could have actually received a telegraph from Western Union saying \"this geezer's gonna try and hit you.\"  I move my head back like six inches, and he whiffs.  Does it again.  Move head four inches to right, whiff.  Again. Move head left. Whiff.\n\nGet tired of this.  drop clipboard, grab old man by armpits and lift him and walk him back to his car and shove him back inside. \"Seriously dude, knock that shit off or I'm gonna hurt you. Now get your insurance out or I'm calling the cops.\"\n\nAt this point, I notice his wife is in the car. Also old AF. The she unleashes a banshee-like howl, \"YOU\"RE CALLING THE POLICE? I\"M CALLING THEM BECAUSE YOU ASSAULTED MY HUSBAND!\"\n \n\"Whatever, bitch. Don't care. Find the insurance shit. I'm pulling over into that parking lot right there.\"\n\nI go move the truck, and while I'm there, I call the boss. Let him know that things are getting weird, and the old man tried to hit me.  All he says is \"just don't fucking kill him, I'll be there in a half hour.\"\n\nI sit in the truck, and I wait. The old guy is fucking glaring at me, and the wife has this strange smile on her face like an \"I'm gonna get you for this\" kinda look.  I'm kinda curious. In the meantime, I've gotten out my licence, and dug out the ownership and insurance shit from the glove box.\n\nAnd HOLY FUCK here comes the PO-LEECE.  There's two or three cruisers, Sirens blaring, lights, the whole nine yards.  One of them parks behind me, one in front, I think there's a third behind the old man. I look the the pair of geezers, and the old broad was giving me the finger.  I got a half a sandwich in my hand, and I just give a wave to the cop in front of me. Kind of a \"hey guys, what the fuck are you so angry about?\" kinda look. \n\nThe guy behind me opens the driver's door and backs away. He tells me to get out of the truck. No problem.  Needs to see my hands. Okay, whatever. I show him my hands. He just makes a little noise, like a little click with his mouth. \"Interesting\"\n\n Another cop, who is a bit older than the first two, and has more stripes on his shirt comes up to me, after talking to the old couple. \"Where's your license and ownership?\"\n\n\"It's sitting on the seat in the truck. My license is right there, but the ownership and the insurance is in the name of my employer. It's a work truck.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute. This isn't your truck?\"\n\n\"Nope. Company truck.\"\n\n\"Well, that's interesting.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You don't own the truck?\"\n\n\"Already told you that. Not my truck.  It belongs to my boss. He's on his way here.\"\n\n\"Wait here.\"\n\nHe goes to talk to the old couple again.  The other cops run my license, call my employer to confirm I am indeed an employee.  Then the cop actually comes back with a damn message from the company receptionist.\n\n\"She wants you to call them. They want you to take the truck to a mechanic.\"\n\n\"Sweet, get paid for that too. Take all the time you guys need, I'm paid by the hour.\"\n\nOne of them goes to talk to the senior guy for a minute.  He just looks at me, looks at the old couple, and then starts walking back to me.\n\n\"You're on the clock for this? You're getting paid right now?\"\n\n\"Yep. Take all the time you need for this.  Hell, the old fucker over there did me a favour, because now I get to go to a garage and wait all day for a mechanic to look at the truck.  I was gonna thank him before he took a swing at me.\"\n\n\"He took a swing at you? But you didn't hit him?\"\n\n\"Not worth the assault charges, yo.  Besides, I used to box. If I hit that geezer, he'd be dead, and I'd be in a fuckton of trouble.\"\n\n\"Yes, you would be.  You used to box?\"\n\n\"Amateur stuff. Good but not good enough.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. What else? Football?\"\n\n\"Yep. And tried rugby, but didn't really get it.\"\n\n\"Hmm.  Stay here.\"\n\nHe goes and gets the old couple.  Actually gets them out of the car. And makes them walk over to where I'm standing with the other two cops.\n\n\"So let me get this straight.  Your story is that you accidentally hit this guy after he cut you off and brake checked you.\"\n\n\"That's exactly what happened, officer.\" *(Lying little Fuck!)*\n\n\"And he got so mad about it, that when you went out to exchange information, he attacked you.\"\n\n\"Yes officer, he hit me, and I got away and my wife called you.\" *(WTF)*\n\n\"So, he assaulted you, after he screamed at you for hitting his truck?\"\n\nWife: \"That's what happened, officer. He was screaming at us for hitting his truck, and then he punched my husband in the face.\" *(Are you fucking kidding me?)*\n\nThis is where it gets good. This cop probably figured it out as soon as I told him it wasn't my truck, like ten minutes ago.\n\n\"So you're story is, that this young fella here, got so mad about you hitting a truck, that isn't even his, that he assaulted you, a senior citizen, and you fought him off?  The 23 year old, ex-boxer who also played football and rugby. He assaulted you? And you fought him off?  That's the biggest lie I've heard since Bill Clinton.  Here's the thing. *If this guy assaulted you, you would look a lot more assaulted*. You don't have a mark on you. If he punched you in the face, you'd be in an ambulance now.  (He turns around, looks at me, and looks back) Hell, If he punched ME in the face, I'd be in an ambulance now.  This is a pile of shit. He don't care that you hit him. It's not his truck. He's getting paid to be here right now. And you try to railroad him?\"\n\nFuck yeah, this is awesome.  It's like this guy say the whole thing.  This cop is good.  But he's not done.\n\n\"You see, now you have a problem. We normally don't send three cruisers to a fender bender.  But you *(points at wife)*  told the 911 operator and me that he assaulted your husband. And you *(points at husband)* just told me that he assaulted you, when anybody can clearly see that there's not a mark on you.  So the both of you have made false allegations. And I'm not exactly pleased with getting my time wasted. This is a part of town where actual crime happens. And we have to deal with fake bullshit where you roadrage on a young kid and then lie about it?\n\nThat was fucking amazing. I got told to go sit in the truck. One of the younger cops went to the senior guy's cruiser and came out with a notepad with a lot of yellow papers. The senior cop took it, and started writing and handing papers to the old guy. Then to the old lady, then another to the old guy.  Then another to the old lady.  This dude was on a roll.  Then he comes back to me.\n\n\"Okay kid, you're good.  Here's my card, in case they try to pull any other shit and sue you or something stupid like that. Give it to your boss. Now enjoy getting paid watching a mechanic look over an indestructible bumper for damage. Oh, here's their insurance info for your boss.  Have a good one.\"\n\nOh, I did.",

        "text": "I'm currently studying criminal justice at a local university, and one of my Professors is an officer with Daytona Beach PD. For the class we just started, he's having everyone (all 5 of us, it's a small program) do a ride along and choose a topic to question the officer about/get their take on it. \n\nI did a six hour ride along with Officer A, and it was mostly a quite night. A domestic call for an unruly pre-teen right off the bat, an hour or so of riding around, then Officer A and a few other Officers served a warrant. We thought the guy was going to run, but he willingly gave himself up. Pulled a few people over, notably a Saudi Arabian young man who is studying at the same university I am. His registration had just expired and he had no idea what Off. A was talking about, so he explained it to him, what he needed to do, and let him go about his business.\n\nTen o'clock rolls around and we decide to get something to eat. Outback was our choice. As soon as we pulled in and he clocked out for lunch on his laptop, the air unit comes over the radio. A chase is happening and we're missing it. Oh well, let's eat.\n\nAs we're heading back to Off. A's district after eating, we see a vehicle that matched one listed on the stolen vehicle bulletin he had been emailed. He calls it in, and an unmarked cruiser that was close by almost immediately tails the car. The unmarked cruiser calls the plates in, and yep - it's the stolen car. Off. A pulls his cruiser into the lot the car was last seen, and I notice the ambient red light from the car's tail lights from around a corner.\n\nOfficer A pulls over and before he can even decide what to do, the car takes off. Leaving a bit off smoke behind as it does. Officer A gives chase while calling it in. At least ten other police vehicles were involved in the case, not including the helicopter that was following the vehicle as soon as it hit a main road. \n\nAbout five minutes later, an officer comes over the radio \"We've got em at (generic name) apartment complex, suspect taken into custody.\"\n\nTonight's experience with Officer A only soldified that this is what I want to do with my life. Thank you for reading.\n\nP.S. - As this literally happened earlier tonight, am I possibly breaking OPSEC/PERSEC by posting this? I'm unfamiliar with what the police force considers sensitive.",

        "text": "   I’ve got to say I’m super thankful for law enforcement and the jobs they do. This just made me love them a little bit more.\n\n   So I was headed home after a long day. I had cruise set at 5 over the speed limit and I was just chilling listening to music with my friend on this two lane back road. This little white car came up out of nowhere and started riding my ass. Apparently even though I was going five over I wasn’t fast enough for them. I wasn’t about to speed up any more so I just ignored them. We were coming up a hill on a double solid line when I guess their patience finally snapped. They swerve out of the lane and gun it trying to get around me. And what do you know, as soon as we come up over the hill there's a car 20 feet from us headed our direction. I slam on the breaks because I don’t want to get hit by what's about to be a huge ass wreck. The white car takes this opportunity and swerves back into the right lane and misses the oncoming car by no more than 2 feet. The fact that they almost just died doesn’t seem to phase them because they continue speeding down the road going at least 80 or 90.\n\n   I was just a little pissed off about this. They almost killed me, my friend, and a car filled with people, not to mention themselves, just because they were in a fucking hurry. I continue driving down the road while ranting about the idiocy of people when all the sudden I hear “whoop whoop” and see a state trooper tear out of a parking lot alongside the road. I’m thinking please please let them be pulling over that asshole and sure enough about a mile down the road the white car was pulled over with the state trooper right behind them. It made my fucking day. I hope that when they are paying off that 300+ dollar ticket that they think about what they did and maybe even consider slowing the fuck down. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/4hciiz/suspect_police_crash_highschool_homecoming_after/",
        "text": "Alright, so this was my senior year of high school, right in the beginning around homecoming. Me and my friend group and all our dates just skipped the actual school party and went to dinner, got a party bus for a few hours, then went to an after party at one of my best friends house, whose parents were home and knew we would be drinking and whatnot so we figured we were fine.\n\nSo, I'll skip to the after party since that's the only relevant part. It was a pretty awesome time, everyone was having fun drinking and everyone had a date and it was homecoming so everyone was obviously in a pretty good mood. Anyhow, at one point this one kid went out with a girl to a car to go smoke some pot and probably fuck too, and as they were walking out and into the car, a police officer happened to be driving by, and I'm sure he staggered or something that made him stop and ask him what he was up to since it was around 1 AM by this point, and to be honest this kid looked kinda young too. Anyways, officer smells booze, he's standing right next to his friend's car with the keys in hand, basically he got a DWI which is real unfortunate since he wasn't intending on driving at all, was just grabbing stuff or having sex or something. Anyways, there was probably like 20 or so cars all parked in front here and a lot of the people in our group smoke pot, and they walked through the cars and found like 5 or 6 cars that had open paraphernalia visible or actual weed. \n\nSo they come to the door, the kid goes and gets his parents and they basically say \"we've been upstairs sleeping but the kids aren't drinking that we know of, everything is fine\" and basically say they can't come in. They went back to the squad car or whatever, and called back up to come watch us while they went to get a warrant (they saw all the weed out front so im sure it was no problem). I think a lot of people just assumed they were totally fucked, or that the cops actually gave up and left, and people started drinking and partying again. Well, I was pretty sober by this point since by the time the whole fiasco with talking to cops and whatnot finished it was probably around 2 AM, and I stopped drinking the moment we first heard about police being there.\n\nAbout an hour later, I'm upstairs in a bedroom vaping weed with a few other people, I have the vape up to my mouth, and all of a sudden the door flies open, and there's a cop in the door. Fuck. I don't know how but the second the door opened I just dropped my hand with the vape in it and dropped it onto a blanket that was on the door by me. The officer thankfully didn't smell the weed somehow (we were just starting) and didn't see the vape, so as I walked out I kinda dragged the blanket on my foot a little so it folded over the vape so at least it wasn't visible. We all walked downstairs, and there were probably 5 or 6 different officers, and of the police there, there were 3 different \"districts\" or whatever of police, like the cities that they belonged to were not the city that we were in. I think this is an important factor for what happens in a bit. We sit down, and one of them starts lecturing us, and they were REALLY mad, like they were pissed we didn't just let them walk in and immediately breathalyze everybody and had to go get a warrant or something. So, they start breathalyzing, I tried to be as late as possible because I thought there was a slight chance I might blow 0's. One funny thing that happened here was that THE drunkest person there (was passed out in the hall for like 2 hours) just got up from the couch, and.. just walked over to the kitchen, where they told everyone to go once they had blown. Nobody noticed, and he just chilled there totally off the hook. Well, most everyone had blown at this point except for a few including myself, and finally a cop points at me and motions me to come up, goes through the steps to do it right \"blow hard til it clicks\" yada yada, I blow, .02. Oh well. They recorded my name, address, DOB, and a parent's name and number on a little yellow notepad, which was only big enough to fit around like 8 kid's information on. I walk to the kitchen with everyone else, and we all shoot the shit and compare BAC's, normal high school stuff.\n\nThe cops come through, tells everyone to call their parents and have them pick you up and what not, and for whatever reason I was not about to call my parents at ~330 am and have them pick me up, I'd just get a ride with one of my friends parents. So I'm chilling, parents are arriving and the cops are still being assholes. I can see how it sounds like I was just a broody high schooler who hates cops cause it's edge, but they actually were just really disrespectful, short with people, and talked down to everybody immediately, and when they were blowing people they just threw the used tips on the ground, and they rolled under furniture and stuff. Finally, most everyone had left including the police, except for basically like this core 6-8 friends in this group and the parents, who weren't that upset because they got off with the charges and are really reasonable and nice people. Maybe a little too nice. \n\nBut anyways, we go back to the living room and talk and I notice that the cops left 2 breathalyzers on the mini bar, and next them are all of the slips of paper they recorded everyone's names on. I suddenly had a huge moment of braveness, and knowing that they would definitely be back to get them, probably soon. I flipped through it quick, found the one with my name, and casually went upstairs to my friends room. I remembered my vape, and found it still sitting in the blanket, and stashed it in my backpack in my stash case quick. I grabbed a lighter out of my friends drawer, popped the window open, and lit the paper with my name on it outside the window, and watched it fully burn until it was completely ash. Went back downstairs, and walked down just in time to see one of my friends who was real sloppy drunk still, pick up a breathalyzer and just straight up drop it on the ground. I laughed, and everyone else noticed the papers and everything. I walked away from it all and sat on the couch to seem as uninvolved as possible, since I knew my friends would have similar ideas. At this point, I was trying to figure out how I was gonna get myself and my car of the house and home. I wasn't about to drive since I blew a .02 about an hour earlier, and if there was a cop still waiting outside the house by chance, or some were coming back to get the papers and breathalyzers I didn't wanna get breathalyzed behind the wheel. \n\nI asked my friend who I knew blew 0's what his plan was, and he said he was just get a ride with someone else since he didn't have his car there. This was perfect for me because he lived close to me so driving my own car home wouldn't be a problem (I was away from where all the \"action\" was, and had around an hour and a half since I blew a .02, so I knew I wasn't really impaired at all). I ask him if he wants to drive my car home, he agrees, and we head out the door to leave. Right as I put my backpack on, another cop comes in through the front door, obviously back for their things. We try and quickly walk by before he notices what people did with the slips of paper so we could be driving away by the time he realized and couldn't chase us back. Well, he stops us and asks if we're leaving, and thankfully he recognized my friend and remembered he blew 0 and doesn't go to get the papers for reference. He does ask to look through our bags though. My friend was clean, and he opened my bag, opened the case I stash my stuff in. For reference, my \"stash spot\" is an orange pelican case, and on the top of the foam is a bunch of syringes, blood glucose meter, and some insulin since I'm a type 1 diabetic. But, the foam pulls out and underneath it all I hollowed out a space to fit a little tin that can hold all my illegals. He opens the case, and obviously I'm a little nervous for obvious reasons, but he shuts the case back up. Whew. But then he opens the case back up. Shit. He glances at it and just shuts it again. He didn't even ask why I had syringes and vials of liquid, which was kind surprising. He lets us go, we book it to my car, and see a cop charger sitting out front with another guy in the passenger seat, whom was probably waiting for his partner since they probably thought he'd just have to run in and out. We go to my car and he pulls out and drives off quick.\n\nHe drove himself home, I got in the driver seat and drive my car like 3 minutes back to my house, I got home at around 5 AM if I remember correctly, and immediately crashed. I wasn't sure if I really got off that easily, but I just had to wait and find out, really. FTR, nothing ever came from it and it's probably my craziest highschool story I think. If people are interested I'll make a comment explaining what happened when the cops realized people took and destroyed evidence, but I wasn't there so I'm not sure if I can really say bc of this sub's rules. \n\n",

        "text": "This is my last interesting law enforcement story. It happened when I was 16. \n\nAs I've mentioned in previous stories, I live in the Netherlands. When I was growing up, the legal drinking age was 16. This has since been raised to 18, but that's irrelevant for the story. We had a school party. Alcohol was served but only to those who were 16+ and only 2 drinks per person. These precautions were wise, but there are always ways around it. My friend (let's call him Nick) had found some of these and was quite, quite drunk. \n\nWe were on the way home from the party at 1am or thereabouts. The party had been at a night club just outside the city. We had to go back to the city by bicycle. That was a ~2km long road that was only accessible to cyclists and pedestrians and it ran over the top of a long dyke. On the right side there was water, on the left side there was farmland. We were cycling with the five of us. Nick, because he was so drunk, was cycling in between two other friends so he couldn't swerve too much. The rest of us had had 2 drinks... Apart from me. I had had no alcohol that night. \n\nAbout halfway down the road I just described, we saw two police officers also on bicycles, coming in from the direction we were going. I said to the others that if they stopped us, I would do the talking, as I was sober. I should explain that while cycling inebriated was technically illegal, penalties were only applied to those who were off their mind on booze and who had no help from sober people. So all we had to do to not get fined was make Nick act normal for about a minute. The rest of us wasn't drunk enough to get fined. \n\nThe police officers do stop us. After exchanging some pleasantries (good evening, that kind of thing), one of them asks us if we're drunk. I start saying the word \"no\" but before I can start to do so I hear barfing noises behind me. I hear another friend (let's call him Mark) say to Nick; \"Oh god, not on your own clothes you idiot. At least aim away from yourself!\"\n\nOne of the police officers walks to Nick, shines his flashlight at him, and asks Nick how much he's had. Nick thinks for a few seconds and then happily says \"8 beers and a wine or two\". It didn't even cross his mind to lie apparently. \n\nWell. Nick got fined. We got ordered to get him home safely. We explained how we'd already taken precautions (the cycling in between two of us). This wasn't enough. He had to ditch his bicycle (park it somewhere and lock it, obviously) and get on the back with one of us. We said we would, and the police officers went on their way. We tried to clean Nick up a bit and when we were done with that, the police officers were so far away that we decided to risk it (stupid, I know). \n\nSo we get back on the bicycles. About 100m further, Nick decides to try cycling with his arms crossed (left hand on the right handle and vice versa). He accidentally hits the brakes (so he wasn't in between my friends anymore) and steers towards the right... Right down the dyke and into the water. \n\nThe two police officers came back (they were patrolling this road because of the school party, I think) when we were still trying to fish Nick out. Mark had already fallen in after Nick because he lost his balance while Nick was hanging on to him. The police officers merely said \"Hate to say I told you so... But I told you so\" in passing and then roared with laughter. \n\nWe eventually got Nick home safely. His father was still up and the man laughed himself silly. I'm still friends with Nick and still come at his parents' house sometimes. He (Nick's father) always greets me with \"Mr. Fisherman! Are they biting a bit?\" and then I'll reply that the last thing I caught was a \"Drunk Bicycle Fish\" (It sounds better in Dutch).",

        "text": "Lurker on mobile etc \n\nBackground: Roughly 5 years ago, 14yo girl in England, with parents in a bitter divorce. It's important to note I'm a T1 diabetic and I charted(with graphs) all my blood sugars, food etc. Hell if I was hella constipated it went on the chart. At the time i had overnight care because my blood sugars were that erratic and it was dangerous. My dad didn't want to pay (he was meant to be paying 1/3 of the night nurse fees) and stole my charts to prove I didn't need care. Even though I did. \n\nI realised he had taken them out of my school bag when I had seen him and my brother and grandad drove me to his house to try and get them back. After threats he was going to call the police, we drove back home empty handed and me crying. \n\nMe: me, Mum: Mum, PO: police officer. \n\nSuddenly there was a knock on my door:\n\n&gt;Me- hello officer how can I help?\n\n&gt;PO- excuse me miss, is there a Jane Smith at this residence? (Pretend name)\n\n&gt;Me- a confused look on my face - yes sir, that's me. \n\n&gt;PO - even more confused look on his face - oh, um please can I talk to an adult? \n\nI ran into the house and grabbed my mum, who was equally as confused. \n\n&gt;Mum - how can I help? \n\n&gt;PO - please can I come in? Your daughter has been accused of trespassing and harassment from a \"Jack Johnson\" (pretend) \n\nAt this point I start crying. The PO comes in and explains that my dad had not only called the police, but has frantically told them that *I*, the 14 yo girl who was tired and depressed, had threatened him and he was scared. He apparently failed to mention he had stolen my medical charts, that I was 14 and that I was his daughter. \n\nThe PO sat down, had a cuppa tea and told me that my dad was a \"bellend who needed to be a father\". He then left and gave my dad a warning for wasting police time! \n\n\nSorry about formatting and if it's not very exciting etc! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This story happened about ten years ago. My aunt had far surpassed street cop level. She had a reasonably well paid desk job at this time but kept up with her shooting and other physical skills, because you never know what will happen. \n\nWe had gone out with the family. There were 9 of us. It was a simple shopping expedition. It was about 3pm. We were in a busy shopping street in the Netherlands when we noticed some people running towards us. Two of them were police officers. They were chasing a man. The man was stark naked... except for a rubber chicken he was... erm... wearing over a floppy appendage. He had cut a hole in it I presume, and had penetrated it with his second head, then went for a jog through the shopping crowds. My aunt took a look at him. She looked taken aback but when the running man came near she brought him to the ground unexpectedly (with a perfectly executed rugby tackle). The police officers assisted quickly. After some paperwork etc., we continued shopping. \n\nThat was the only time I witnessed an arrest, but it was sure a memorable one.",

        "text": "Before I begin this tale, i would like to let you all know the following: this is a highly personal and sensitive story for me. I know most of you will keep reading, but please be warned that this can be very heavy for some people to read. In the text is the story of an attempted suicide, followed by an attempted suicide by cop. im sorry if its hard to follow, i'm typing as i'm thinking. it helps.\n\n----------------\n\nI am a complete failure.\n\nHigh school went well enough, I coasted through. 3.5 GPA money from mom and pops for college. Went through Basic and AIT to join the army reserves. Everything seemed to be going ok. Well...it wasn't. I have ADD, which me and my parents have hidden from the world since they believed it wasn't real, and i knew it was a plan killer for my goal of being in the army. Structured orderly life worked to keep the ADD at bay. It's kinda hard to get distracted or forgetful with a very strict schedule and everything on paper and under tight control. So i had never had any issues.\n\nUntil I was on my own. suddenly i had all of these responsibilities, and i couldn't prioritize. Got to be at drill got to keep the car running and the inspection up and the oil changed and gowithfriends...my responsibilities became a big mucked up ball that i couldn't sort and it cost me, dearly.\n\ncouldnt keep schedules lost job, then girlfriend, then my second job. Boom, 3 major blows in less then 2 months. \n\nduring a drill i get into a humvee accident. then heat strokes because i stood with a full canteen in my hands talking with my battles instead of drinking...tricare denied me coverage because i didn't follow procedure. or something, that all got lost in the nearly constant head fog.\n\nthen i start missing drills. i couldn't get out of bed, i had no will left. i started getting in screaming matches with close friends and relatives over nothing.\n\nmy apartment got robbed....well ransacked really, nothing was taken because i had nothing really. Then, one fine spring morning, Crystal clear skies, and i realized i had slept through my alarm again... missed drill....again..\n\nMy platoon was going to get smoked because of my dumb ass\n\nagain....\n\nBut none of you knew any of this.\n\nAll you knew was that a frantic women called in a missing young white male, her son. possibly armed with a shotgun and with unknown amount of ammo. then another call from a soft voiced man saying that they had gotten reports one of their soldiers had left a suicide note and was rambling incomprehensibly on the phone driving around aimlessly. They were doing their best to get his location but they feared he was armed and dangerous. possibly near a school.\n\nAll you knew was when the negotiator got a hold of the individual, that the suspect was parked at a intersection on some old farm land..so far in the boondocks that the roads were not even paved anymore. and he was screaming because he had just broke his lighter and couldn't light his \"fucking last cigar\"\n\nso, there i sit, seething in blind rage at the world. unable to get even a nicotine fix to calm my nerves. im in a black hoodie. and i throw the phone in the back seat, my minds racing. everything's getting muddled together, there's a white car behind me, lights on. no siren, parked at about a 45 degree angle 30-50 meters... field to my right, farm house in the far distance to my left...engines running\n\ndo i run?\n\nno i'm sick of running...i might as well try the cigar again, white owl. good stuff if you are broke.\n\nit breaks in my hand, i'm trembling. i see figures up at the farmhouse, then a line of people file out, then a dark uniformed man with a long rifle go in.\n\n*Fuck*\n\ni'm getting scared, your going to kill me, no i'll kill me. MY terms not yours. **MY terms.** \n\nthree squad cars pull up slowly and cut off the road in front of me 75 meters no sirens, lights only. ambulance far in the distance near the treeline. waiting for me.\n\nim surrounded. no, not like this. my terms god damn it!\n\nI put the 20 gauge  shotgun under my chin, hammer against my hoodie, trigger out and pull as hard as i can, deer slug loaded. \n\nbye, fuck you all. \n\n\n^*POP*\n\nmisfire, the hammer got caught in my hoodie. I sat there for...I don't know\n\nand i got madder. it was your fault you see, your all at fault *cant be me*. *i did MY best*. ill take you with me...\n\ni start to get up, wanting to get back at the world. fighting with my shotgun as its caught in my hoodie and just getting more tangled. barely noticing you ducking behind the cars shouting. didnt hear a word. just an angry roar in my ears. fuck the world, i wont play nice anymore i tried being nice. then i hear a megaphone\n\n\n*would you like a lighter?*\n\n\nit snapped me out of whatever i was in...my hoodies ripped, i'm bleeding still in my car, many MANY guns are probably pointed at me. and one guy in a sky blue shirt, black and white checkered tie, big square glasses standing about 5 feet in front of the police cars saying\n\n*would you like a lighter? i heard you smoke and your lighter broke...would you like one?*\n\nsome other things were said but the only thing i heard was there was a lighter waiting for me...and this guy with the megaphones standing nonchalantly, as if waiting for a bus, but his eyes were fixed on me.\n\ni roll down my window and he takes a few steps back. something about don't do this. or wait. something like that.\n\n\"does any one have a cigarette?\" is my response.\n\ni wanted a cigarette more then anything else in the god damn world right then and there. i had wanted one all damn day.\n\n\"is Marlboro ok?\"\n\n\"if its smokable i don't give a shit.\"\n\n\"we can give you one. Just come on out. alright? no ones gonna hurt you, ok? but you gotta do us a favor. Leave the gun in the car. alright?\"\n\nalright, as long as i get my smokes. i like this guy he doesnt care im a fuck up, hes not mad or angry or scared i think. he didnt judge me. he is offering smokes, to a guy whos about to fill the quiet country air with who knows how many gunshots. ok.\n\ni leave the shotgun across the drivers seat, hoodie open, and i walk towards them, their guns still locked onto me.\n\ni feel a bit woozy so i go over to a sign pole, and sit down and lean back against it, exhaling. i look up, sky is crystal clear. i stare at it while they come over. a kind man asked if i had anything that might hurt him. \n\"not really, just a pocket knife, front right pocket\" \n\ni stare out the window puffing through a pack of cigarettes and relaxing as i'm driven to the hospital. i don't speak, what is there to say? it was such a beautiful day.\n\nnow its three years later. life got worse, i ended up homeless twice after that day. it had gotten far worse. But, i'm better. i'm doing my best, and some people give a damn. i guess all i really wanted was just someone to listen, not coddle or berate or punish or pity me. just someone who hears about a guy really fucking mad about not having a damn smoke, so he comes with smokes. why didn't anyone else think of that?\n\ni don't even know your name, but i owe you my life. lifes still shit but that doesn't stop it from being beautiful\n\n\n--------\n\n*edit*\n\nWow. I have been getting PMs and messages Like crazy for this post. A lot of you who messaged me are saying that this story has helped you in one way or another. Some have come to me for advice. Others (and not just a few either) suggested I become a writer..... I think I will!\n\nMy inbox is always open for whoever wants to talk. I may not know what to do in your situation but that doesn't mean I can't offer a smoke or drink if you need it. You guys and gals are all outstanding! I'm just average.",

        "text": "Long story but I want to be as brief as possible.  6am I walked along the beach near my house for first time at low tide.  Beach ended near rocks, and on top of rocks was sewage plant.   Nature-walked and took photos for 3 hours while stoned.  Tried to leave, but tide has risen and beach was not exposed.  I had literally no physical choice to exit via sewage plant or swim in 40 something degree water.\n\nFrom the rocks there was a hedge with a desire path to the lot of the plant.  I walked to the lot and started walking up the hill to exit the plant.  An officer then stops me.\n\nApparently I was trespassing.  I saw zero signs.  Didn't even know I was on private property, was just trying to leave.  Before I could even explain the tide situation, or hell, even ask why I was being stopped, the cop started doing that thing where they try to act tough.  That sickening facade they put on...\n\nHe immediately starts talking to the plant worker and believes the plant worker.  Btw, the plant worker should've asked me to leave instead of calling the cops for no fucking reason, ugh.  Would have obeyed kindly.\n\nAnyway yea the officer asks for my name, birthday and shit. I literally just asked \"Why are you asking me for this tuff, what's even going on\" and I was greeted with intimidation strats, like I have to tell them my name and shit, on the spot with no context unexpectedly.  Next thing I know I am thrust into the back of his cop car rather forcefully and he slams the door and another officer arrives.  They leave me in there for 10 minutes.  I can overhear lies from the plant worker saying I was running around entering shit.  Not even fucking true, wtf?  I'm just overhearing this shit sitting in the back of the cop car next to a transparent wall and with two shotguns on the other side.\n\n\n\"Yea we'll get him outta here.\"\n\n\"You won't be seeing him again\"\n\n\"Annoying, I know\"\n\n**\"Take his camera, look through it please\"**\n\nand just other rude comments.\n\n\nIt's just like direct confrontations don't exist anymore.  Don't like something?  Don't voice it whatsoever - just phone the police!\n\nWanna become a police officer?  Remember to only side with the one who originally phoned the station  - they're always right!  And instantly treat the other guy like shit when you arrive with no context or info.  Use intimidation strategies.   You will probably get away with it all because the person you're being a douchebag too probably doesn't have the time or money to bring your sorry ass to court anyway. I think it's just easy money to be a mediocre cop. Probably fun to be rude to strangers too. Kudos to the cops that are out there though to actually do their job right and protect us though :)\n",

        "text": "I was working the evening shift in my county PD when a call came out about a subject being disorderly and injuring an off-duty officer working secondary. Several of us arrive and cuff the subject and place him in the backseat of my cruiser while my sergeant talks to the off-duty. The store had previously banned the suspect, and when he tried to go in, the manager called security (the off-duty officer) to remove the suspect. The suspect tried to fight the off-duty and cuts the off-duty officer's hand with a steak knife. As I'm taking notes about the event and listening to the off-duty and my sergeant, the suspect tries to kick the back windows out of my cruiser. One of partners was at the car and pulls the guy, puts him against the car holding the suspect with one hand while holding his OC can in the other. He looks at my sergeant who gives him the palms up like \"what are you waiting for?\" My Partner sprays the suspect with what must have been half a can of OC spray. The rear half of my car's roof, the backside of the light bar, and the passenger side of the rear glass was orange from the OC spray. My sergeant goes into the store and walks out with two 1-gallon jugs of water. He keeps one to drink and we flush the suspect's face and eyes with other. I then transport the suspect to the precinct. During the drive to the precinct, I tell the suspect repeatedly to be sure to wash his hands before he does anything else. He asks \"Why?\" I reply \"You got sprayed, right?\" He says \"Yes.\" I advise the suspect that he’s been rubbing his face and eyes and, if he touches anything, it going to burn like crazy. We get to the precinct and I take the suspect into lock-up, complete the intake form, and pass him off to the Booking officer. I go start my paperwork but go back to lock-up to get some additional info and the Booking officer asks \"Where did you find this guy?\" I ask \"What did he do?\" The Booking officer replies that the suspect asked to use the bathroom. He went in and a minute later, screamed like a little girl. I waited until the suspect came out of the bathroom and ask \"What did I tell you all the way here?\" He says \"Wash my hands.\" I then ask “Did you?” and the suspect says “No.” I tell him that's what you get for not listening and he just laughs and says \"Yep.\" Geez, I miss police work.",

I could ride my bike up the concrete patio that overlooks the station and just do some quality people watching while keeping my bicycle within arms reach just in case I needed to respond somewhere quickly. \n\nThe study of human behavior is one of the things that piques my interests, and what better place to study human beings than a place that attracts tens of thousands of people daily. I learned the game of pickpocketing from sitting in this very spot just watching people. Watching the game, watching how the most subtle of jostling can be a tip that a pickpocket just occurred, then doing a lot of reading in to the art of pickpocketing to temper my observational skills.\n\nOne day, I was profiling one potential for pickpocketing when I quickly realized he wasn't doing some of the more subtle cues to indicate a pickpocket. Essentially, he was stopping in front of people to force them to stop walking or walk around him to avoid him. I moved closer to the crowd filtering on to the subway station escalators to hear better and found he was begging for change as he stopped people.\n\nBasically, the guy was violating a public nuisance law for panhandling, an arrestable offense. I parked my bike on a nearby pole and walked over to the dude to give him a move along order. I stopped right in front of him as multiple people walked by us, oblivious to our interaction. He stared at me blankly as I explained the ordinance to him and asked him to move along. Nothing, not even a nod to acknowledge my presence. He just stood there, blankly staring at me as I tried to engage him several times.\n\nSensing that something was wrong, I began to reach towards my shoulder mic to call for an additional unit when the guy suddenly rushed me and wrapped one arm around me, pinning the arm going for the radio mic to my side. Startled by the movement, I made the unconscious decision to shuffle my body backwards in to a defensive posture and discovered I couldn't move due to the subject stepping on my lead foot and pinning it to the ground. At the same time, the subject pushed his arm up across my chest with his forearm and grabbed the collar of my uniform shirt, twisting it over his fist and pulling it tight across my throat in a lapel choke, using his other hand to grip the back of my Load Bearing Vest pulling inwards and upwards as if he was attempting to lift me off of my feet. Using the push and pull of both of his arms to complete the maneuver, I instantly felt intense pressure on my throat and neck and I started to see spots almost instantly.\n\nI learned through training in the Army and the Academy that there was a difference between strangulation techniques. There are techniques that restrict air flow, then there are techniques that cut off the circulation to the brain, and finally, combination techniques that are the most dangerous of all that restrict air flow and blood flow to the brain. Unconsciousness can occur within 10-15 seconds of application, and death can occur within several minutes of continuous application, potentially exposing your weapons to the perpetrator once you go unconscious.\n\nRight at that moment, I started to feel the tunneling effect indicative of a strangulation technique that was restricting blood flow to the brain. Your body becomes sluggish, your breathing rate increases, you start to feel sleepy, and the world starts to appear distant, as if you're slowly slipping away. Spots appear before your eyes and everything becomes blurry. People have described it as seeing \"the light at the end of the tunnel\", where your peripheral vision reduces by 70% due to the activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System. \n\nI tried to back out, but I couldn't. The subjects lock on my body was so strong that I could barely move. I tried to struggle, reverting back to my training and was able to tuck my chin and smile enough to flex my neck muscles to slightly alleviate the crushing force of the lapel choke. I couldn't move my feet to create distance, but I did somehow notice my support hand was only partially blocked by the elbow of the subject's arm gripping the collar of my shirt.\n\nThinking quickly, I snaked my arm around the subjects elbow and slipped it down the front between our bodies out of his grasp and immediately began punching the subject as hard as I could in the rib cage. Over and over again, I swung my closed fist in to the rib cage as hard as I could. He didn't even budge after the first few strikes. Panic began to set in, and desperation turned in to resolve as I redoubled my efforts and began cranking hits towards the diaphragm in an effort to wind the subject. His grip loosened on my collar and I gasped sweet air while keeping up my assault until he grunted and released my strong arm.\n\nUsing the distraction to my advantage, I grabbed the outside of his wrist that was using the collar of my shirt and took up the slack around the wrist, levering the arm across the inside of my forearm and slammed him on to his back using a front take-down. After getting him cuffed, I was finally met by a cadre of backup due to a nice concerned citizen calling in the fight to dispatch.\n\nEven though the \"fight\" lasted a few seconds (later, I found out we were engaged for around 30 seconds from start to finish), it was long enough for the medics who arrived on scene to insist I be taken to the hospital for examination. I spent the night there getting tests done and after getting a clean bill of health, was released the next day without incident. The subject was treated for broken ribs and was released and booked without incident. The courts ruled that he was in severe mental distress and required hospitalization, which nullified criminal charges against him. I never did find out why he did what he did, but I suspect the mental health order had something to do with it.",

        "text": "“Leopard geckos?”\n\n“Yeah. I’ve been doing research. I think they’re the ideal pet: calm, insectivores, will hide in your shirt pocket and sleep all day…”\n\n“Sounds… good?” I didn’t feel strongly enough towards either side of the argument to put up a fight. \n\n“Well, it’s either that or you and I get stuck walking a puppy every morning at six AM.” My wife, Emily, had included me in that statement but deep down we both knew it would be her doing all the work if we folded and got or sons a dog. It was a brilliant execution of a tactical guilt trip. \n\n“Leopard geckos it is!” \n\n“Great. I just called Petsmart. They got a shipment in yesterday of two hatchlings. Wanna go now?” \n\n“Yeah!” the boys had been eaves dropping. There was definitely no backing out now. \n\nWe loaded up the family roadster and headed towards our reptilian soon-to-be family members. I was busy looking up the essentials on my phone in the passenger seat, ticking off each thing we would need and doing some mental math at the impending impact on my wallet. “I guess it’s a good thing I’ve been working all that overtime, huh?”\n\n“We’ll be fine.” Emily assured me. She is definitely the accountant in our partnership and I was glad she had already pre-approved the transaction. “It should only be a couple hundred bucks. You were called out twice this week. Seems like destiny to me.”\n\nIt was a bright Saturday morning and I looked away from my phone to take in the freshness of spring. “Cross your fingers I don’t get a call today. I’m ready for some down time at home, y’know?” \n\n“Yeah, we’ve missed you this week.” \n\nI scanned the intersection where we were stopped, a habit from my patrol days. All four directions of traffic had red lights and a prolonged crosswalk signal slowly counted down to their next cycle. A trio of teenagers were leisurely crossing the road. Judging their books by their covers, they appeared to be of the stoner variety: The male in front was a thick built six-foot-three, bedecked in torn jeans and a Megadeath shirt. His female companion to his right had on an ancient pair of Chuck Taylors, untied and faded to some rare hue. Her bean pole legs sprouted from a pair of too-small jean shorts and she finished the ensemble with a battered hooded sweatshirt and no attempt to manage her bed head. The third member of the group wore long jeans and a drab olive jacket reminiscent of a military knock-off. His most remarkable feature was his massive hair, curling in every direction and bobbing with every step. His Aviator glasses were fixed firmly on the ground in front of him but were obscured with every dip of his hair. That hair though… it sparked something in my brain…\n\n“Wait. That’s my guy! The robbery guy!” I turned on the passenger seat as my wife accelerated through the intersection. \n\n“Which one?” She asked, making a fair point. I had been working a lot of ‘robbery guys’ of late. Sideshow Bob, however, was my white whale. I had taken on the case for a friend in the robbery section of our Investigations Division. He had warned me it might be a tough one as Bob was friends with every stoner within twenty miles and was known to couch hop in exchange for providing his hosts gram bags. In fact, it was one of these hosts who ultimately became the victim of a home invasion robbery by Bob and another unknown male. Apparently his signature hairdo was as obvious to the victim then as it was to me as he walked out of view.\n\nSurveillance on Bob’s last known address had resulted only in frustration and made me break one of my cardinal rules – I approached his family to determine his whereabouts. His father was very helpful, telling me they were lucky if they saw Bob once a month but that he also had no phone that they knew of. His mom was quiet while I was there, and I later found out had made a call to a friend of a friend of Bob, informing him I was on the prowl. The father called me to tell me he was definitely going to be deep in hiding now that he knew the cops were on to him. \n\n“The guy who I’ve been on for a month! The one who pistol whipped one of his own friends!” I was straining my neck to get another glimpse of the group as we traveled away. \n\n“What is it mom?” My oldest son, Eli, was looking around too, trying to be helpful but needing clarification of his mission. \n\n“Daddy saw one of the bad guys he’s looking for. “ She glanced from the road to me again. “What are we going to do?”\n\nI hesitated. This had all the earmarks of becoming a bad situation: family van versus desperate fugitive. I looked to Emily to get a read on what she felt comfortable with. The glimmer in her eye and excited smirk gave me my answer. \n\n“Let’s get turned around. I’ll show you where to park for surveillance while I call in backup.” \n\n“Yesssss!” Hissed Eli. His brother, Raymond, shrank a little in fear. \n\nEmily whipped around in the next intersection and adjusted her seat forward. Her eyes narrowed in focused attention as she zigzagged through traffic to make her way over to the road we had just turned from. I dialed dispatch and identified myself to the call taker. “I’m ninety percent sure it was him,” I explained. “He was last seen in the company of two others, a male and female, South on Oak on foot.”\n\n“Ok, I’ve started three patrol units.” I thanked her and hung up, then scrolled through the emails saved on my phone until I found one with Bob’s photo. We turned South on Oak Street and I held up the phone so Emily could see the picture. \n\n“Here they are.” I told the whole car as we passed the group, still plodding along but now hidden by some shrubbery. “It’s him, right?” \n\nEmily looked at the picture, then the back of Bob’s head as we passed. She was more concerned with driving than my fugitive but I got another good look. I was even more convinced it was my guy. \n\n“I don’t know.” Emily dashed my confidence. “Other than the hair, I don’t see it.” \n\nI pondered my options as we continued down the road, eventually telling Emily to pull off a side street perpendicular to Oak. “Really?” I asked her after she got the car parked. “You think that wasn’t him?” \n\n“I can’t say for sure. This is your gig, I’m just your driver.”\n\n“Is he going to hurt us?” Raymond asked. \n\n“No way. I’m going to jump out and punch him in the face!” Eli assured him. I gave him an accusatory glare then turned to Emily. \n\n“I’m going to jump out and take a walk. I’ll be back in a second.”\n\n“Be safe.” The concern on Emily’s face was obvious and I assured her I would be fine. \n\nI held my phone up to my ear, pretending to be in conversation as a cover while I walked back up Oak in the direction I had last seen the group. I got as far as the shrubbery they had been concealed by without seeing them. I cursed my luck and turned around as my phone, still plastered to my ear, began to ring. I didn’t recognize the number. \n\n“Detective EMR? This is Officer Smith. I’m almost on scene and wanted to know if you could still see them.”\n\n“They must’ve gone down another street or cut through one of the lots.” I told him. “We have the South end under surveillance.”\n\n“Oh, is your team here?” \n\nI realized again the potential for a bad thing to happen as I reluctantly informed him “No. I mean we as in me and my family.”\n\n“Oh. Well, do you want to meet at the church and brief us on the case?” There was a bit of confusion peppered into his tone.\n\n“Sure, I’ll be there in a second.” I motioned to Emily to trade me seats and she quickly complied.\n\n“Did they get him?” She asked, bubbling over with excitement from the passenger seat. \n\n“No, I didn’t see them just now. We’re going to go meet the patrol guys and I’ll show them his picture. Be looking out for them as we double back.” I pulled from our surveillance position and took the long way back towards the church in hopes of spotting out quarry along the path. \n\n“Look for bad guys kiddos!” Emily called back as she herself scanned the scenery out the window. \n\n“Did he kill someone daddy?” Eli asked, hoping, it seemed, for me to answer in the affirmative. \n\n“No, he just did some bad things to one of his friends over some other bad things that he shouldn’t be involved in.”\n\n“Oh. Drugs.” He concluded before returning to his sentry duty out the window. Emily and I exchanged a shrug. \n\nI pulled into the church parking lot as two patrol units were arriving and got out to greet them. “Thanks fellas. I don’t know how I lost them, they definitely didn’t see us.”\n\nOne of the guys waved to a smiling Eli and grimacing Raymond. “How did you get this approved?” He asked, motioning to my family. \n\n“Oh, I’m off duty, just saw this guy as we were heading to the pet store.”\n\n“You should do it more often. It’s good cover!”\n\n“Yeah, so…” I pulled out my phone and navigated to Bob’s mugshot again. “This guy is wanted for armed robbery and felony assault. The gun is still outstanding and he’s a known dope dealer. I last saw him in the company of two others: a white male and female, both wearing black shirts. They were by the bushes at Oak and 3Rd.”\n\n“Cool. He should be easy to spot with that hair. Sarge is coming too. He already started K9 and the helicopter.” \n\nI shrank inwardly a bit, hoping Emily’s conclusion that I could be mistaken with my ID was not true. I’d have a lot of explaining to do if she was right. Another patrol unit arrived, then the Sergeant – a newly promoted guy I knew from my time in auto theft as a go-getter. I briefed everyone once K9 (Byron, my buddy from the days in the barrio) arrived and soon the helicopter was circling overhead. Tensions eased and I was in the middle of regaling the patrol officers with the tale of when I tricked Byron into picking up a giant dildo we found in a homeless camp when the radios piped up with traffic from the helicopter. \n\n“Air one. Have ground units ask the detective of the target had on a black backpack.”\n\nI nodded to the closest guy who keyed his mic. “He says affirmative.” \n\n“10-4. We’ve got the group bedded down in a small patch of woods. 3rd and Elm. Start this way.” I went to jump in my cruiser but was greeted with Emily pointing to the helicopter and laughing with Eli and Raymond. All the other cruisers peeled out of the lot and fired up their overheads (we were too close for sirens, it would alert them we were coming). \n\n“Why’d they leave?” Eli asked. \n\n“They see them in the helicopter.” I replied. I made an expression towards Emily indicating I was a bit nervous. The dice were rolled, now to see if I went all in on the wrong bet. “Should we go get some geckos?”\n\nIt turns out my worries were for nothing. As soon as the first cruiser came within eye shot of the group, they took off running. All three were quickly apprehended with the assistance of the helicopter and Bob had a little under a pound of marijuana in his backpack. The guy with him was wanted for an attempted murder in another jurisdiction. I later found out he was also the prime suspect in a completed murder in yet another jurisdiction and was charged with it a week later. Emily conveniently forgot her lack of faith in my dirt-bag radar, and has since taken over the role as lead story teller, spreading the story among her friends about the time her whole family took down a robber and murderer in one fell swoop. \n\nThe leopard geckos are awesome too. \n\nPICS: [I call this guy stumpy,](http://i.imgur.com/K1Pp06j.jpg) [and this guy Lazy.](http://i.imgur.com/4eEZ4Iw.jpg)",

        "text": "British ex-police officer with a major Metropolitan force, here. One Friday night in 1987, I was off-duty and had been out for the evening. I lived in the centre of a major UK city then, so I didn't have far to walk. It was a simpler time; no mobile phones, fewer cars on the streets, fewer people. It was a more naive time too; more innocent.\n\nI'll never forget this night, though. As I approached my front door, I heard a woman yell out in pain. It's funny how your ear becomes attuned to the different types of scream; this wasn't a squeal, or a startled noise, or the sound of a girl having fun. It was a blood-curdling, bone-chilling sound that penetrated to my very soul, and it was coming from a girl I knew who lived a few doors up from me.\n\nI'd been drinking; I wasn't paralytic,so let's just say that I wasn't in a fit state to drive. Forget coffee, this was the quickest way I've ever gone from drunk to sober. Ever. It was like someone had flicked a switch. I was drunk. Then I wasn't.\n\nMy training kicked in. I was 19 and I'd only been in the force for a year at the time:  I was fit, young and eager. I ran up the street to find my neighbour lying by her front door in a pool of blood. She'd been slashed repeatedly across the face with a knife; the left side of her cheek was literally hanging off and she was bleeding profusely. Another neighbour had already called an ambulance and was comforting her.\n\nI crouched down and held her hand as I asked her what had happened. She worked as a hotel receptionist and had been followed home by a man she'd never seen before. He had followed her up her front path and as she got her keys out, he'd asked her if she was a prostitute. When she told him, \"No, I'm not\", he pulled a Stanley knife from inside his jacket, and without explanation, slashed her repeatedly across the face before running off.\n\nShe said he'd been smartly dressed and was wearing a jacket and tie. After getting a brief description of him from her and making her as comfortable as I could, I set off to search the area for her attacker. About 15 minutes later, I found myself in the city's main shopping street. It was approaching 23:00 but given that this particular city is a world-renowned destination, there were a lot of people and traffic about. I'd seen lots of people, but nobody matching the man's description.\n\nAs I stood on the pavement looking around, a man caught my eye. He was about 30 yards away from me, and was standing around as if waiting for someone, but he looked out of place. I knew instinctively that something about him was 'off''. To this day, I can't put my finger on it, but I just knew. His face was flushed as if he'd been running, and he was sweating. He was smartly dressed, but he wasn't wearing a tie.\n\nI approached the man and, pulling my warrant card from my pocket, I identified myself as an off-duty police officer. I explained that he matched the description of someone who'd been involved in a crime and I asked him about his movements. He claimed to have been to a club, but couldn't tell me which one, nor where it was. He was vague. I asked him if he'd been running. He said yes, explaining that he had run for a bus but had missed it.\n\nI asked him if he had any ID on him, and he said no, he had left his wallet at home, thus contradicting what he'd previously told me about being at a club; if he had no wallet, how had he paid for his evening? How was he planning to pay for the bus?  Then I asked him if he had anything in his pockets. He took out a tie. He said he'd been wearing it, but had got too hot, so he'd taken it off.\n\nI told him that I was arresting him on suspicion of committing Grievous Bodily Harm and went to grab his arm. As I did so, he reached into his jacket and pulled a Stanley knife out. I knocked it from his hand and it clattered to the floor. As it did, I pushed the man to the ground and began restraining him as best I could. It was a tense moment; I was unarmed, without a radio, handcuffs or any other equipment, and I was alone. \n\nIn a moment of perfect timing that I couldn't have scripted better, a uniformed patrol car was passing and saw what was happening. It screeched to a halt and the two-man crew came running towards us. I identified myself as an off-duty officer from a neighbouring station and, after using one of the officer's handcuffs to secure the prisoner, I explained what had happened.\n\nAfter we had driven to the station, the prisoner was processed and interviewed. He admitted attacking my neighbour with the knife but offered no defence nor explanation for his actions. He was charged with GBH with Intent and appeared in court a short time later. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years in prison.\n\nFor my own part, I received a commendation from the Commissioner. My neighbour's face was tended to by an excellent plastic surgeon who did great work. She had been beautiful before the attack; after the plastic surgeon had finished his work, she was beautiful again. A  few months later, the visible scars had diminished considerably. \n\nSadly, the scars inside her took rather longer to heal. She was still a beautiful person, but she had lost her independent streak and her confidence.  Thirty years on, I often wonder about her, and what she did with her life. I've barely thought about the man who, without reason or provocation, attacked her, though. Why should I? He doesn't deserve my time, thoughts or emotion. \n",

        "text": "Strap in, this is unnecessarily long. I started to get really into it when I wrote it, but I thought it read better this way. Hope you enjoy.\n****\n\nTaz totally deflated as he glanced at the flashing screen. “All the good shit going on and we get this. People not covering their own shitty calls and now I have to deal with it. I swear…” He hooked a sharp right and flipped on his equipment as we made tracks out of the rough neighborhood we’d been rolling around. I’d hoped that riding in this sector, with one of the most dangerous neighborhoods for at least 100 miles around, would have allowed me to see something more exciting than stop sign enforcement or the accident with minimal injury we were on our way to. I supposed I was a bad luck charm after all, seeing as we’d been tied up for all the fights and assorted random gunfire that came with the area. “I can’t even find my stupid air horn,” Taz complained as we wove through 1 AM traffic. “All these drunk idiots aren’t gonna move for me anyway, I don’t know why I’m bothering.” The local bars were all in the process of kicking everyone else out for the night and there was definitely some sketchy driving going on. We pounded pavement over some railroad tracks, past a few low-end clubs and over a bridge filled with late night fishermen. “I hate having to deal with this, dude….Dude, your headlights. Come on!” Taz’s mumbling was interjected with an address at hatchback coming the other way, in between two lanes, no lights, 20 miles under the speed limit, most definitely plastered. “I bet we see him later,” I said. Taz snorted as we arrived at the intersection where the crash had occurred.\n\nActually, “crash” was a strong word. Two sedans were parked in a work zone on the side of the road. One’s license plate had been knocked off, and the other appeared to have no damage. A precursory glance showed the second car with a rear wheel askew, but not much else. Not bad looking, but not drivable either. The ambo crew had beat us there and was in the process of unloading the stretcher. “Who’s injured?” Taz queried. “The passenger,” the EMT responded. “Neck or back pain or something. Dunno.” All three of us looked at the (lack of) damage. “What, from that?” Taz said. The EMT shook his head. “I know. It’s total bullshit. Gotta be trying to get that insurance money, or something. She looks…sketchy, bro.” Taz walked over to the two drivers, as the EMT’s loaded up the “female” passenger, very clearly a linebacker-esque man in a dress and a wig. Hoo boy. Taz was asking the first driver about what had happened. “Which way were you going?” The driver had a puzzled look on his face. “No, no…..I went, it…..this way. Market Street. Me. My…my light green. Him, no. Jefferson? Jefferson Street? Red light. He go anyway, no, we hit…” He pantomimed the two cars hitting each other. He turned to me imploringly. “You speak Spanish? Please?” I shook my head and mumbled a “lo seinto” as the other unit, Baker, walked over from the second driver. “Hey, you should go interview the passenger before they transport her. This guy speaks Spanish, and the other guy has French and Arabic. No English. Zero.” Taz sighed. “Alright. Guess we’ll see if there’s any free Spanish speakers on the Westside when I’m done.” He climbed into the back of the ambulance as Baker and I stood and looked at the two cars. “This is nothing, man. How many gunfire calls have there been tonight, and you guys caught this one? That sucks.” I nodded. “Plus, Taz, like, can NOT deal with people who don’t do English.” I nodded again. “I kind of gathered that,” I said. “I guess working the hood you don’t really find a lot of use for Arabic.” Baker shook his head. “I was stationed in Afghanistan for a while, and I picked up some Pashtu, but something tells me ‘Don’t move or I’ll blow a fucking hole in you’ is gonna help much here.” “Yeah, and my Arabic is tapped out after ‘What’s up, bro,’” I added. “I have some French, but if I start asking this guy all the questions I feel like that’s gonna violate some form I signed.” Baker chuckled. “You two’ll figure it out. I’m clearing. Don’t need to deal with this shit.”\n\nBaker waved as he hopped in his car to go break up a fight at a fast-food joint. Taz emerged from the ambo as they shut the doors and took off. “So she’s fine. She’s also a man.” He looked at his notebook. “Marcus, apparently. He/she is also definitely a prostitute.” Even I could see that just from looking, I thought to myself. “So now I gotta get Manuel or whatever here to admit it, and then there’s this other guy….what a cluster.” He sighed as he called for a Spanish speaking officer. The radio returned an ETA of 10 minutes. “I guess we’ll talk to the other guy, then.” He turned back to Manuel. “Sit tight for a minute. I’ll be back with you.” Manuel looked confused as Taz walked away. I pointed at the same spot Taz had. “Uno momento. Seientate.” He looked grateful and plopped down on his tire-scuffed bumper. As we walked over to the second driver, we watched him hand a wad of money to a guy carrying a huge red bag. “Woah woah woah.” Taz stopped the guy with the bag. “Hang on a second.” The second driver became upset. “No! No! You….my car….can help? I leave.” He practically dragged us over to his car. Taz watched the third party seize his chance and wander off. “Man, I hope he wasn’t trying anything shady on this guy,” he mumbled. His repeated attempts to calm the driver down to follow the bag man were only met with more jumbled English. Taz sighed again. “Fuck it. Can’t worry about it now, he’s gone. We’ll just have to ask about it later.” With backup still 8 minutes out, and him not being able to leave me to look after either driver, it would have to just be that way for now.\n\n“Alright, so what happened?” Taz asked the driver. The man shook his head. “Sorry.” There was a long pause. “I change….tire? I go.” He turned to start on finding his spare tire. “Dude, your car is broken. That won’t help.” Taz looked apprehensively at the rear wheel. “Do you have a driver’s license?” The driver straightened up and began digging in his pocket before producing a red laminated piece of paper covered in Arabic. “What the shit is this,” Taz muttered. “Sit tight for a minute, okay?” The driver nodded. Taz and I returned to the car. “He’s got no damn license, of course. That makes it that much harder. What even is this?” He stared quizzically at the piece of folded paper, bearing a seal and “Republique de Mauritania,” surrounded by a massive amount of Arabic script. “I’m gonna guess that’s a driver’s license from his home country?” I offered. “What in the hell…and then Manuel. You’re from his area, you tell me, does that license look right to you?” I guessed Taz didn’t see too many out-of-state licenses regularly, and Manuel lived right up the road from my hometown, so I looked at it as well. “I mean….they look like this, but it seems kinda messed up. Maybe it’s fake, maybe it’s just really beat up. I honestly can’t tell.” I handed them both back as Garcia arrived and pulled in behind us. “Thank fuck for that,” Taz remarked as he looked in his rearview. “A little help.” He hopped out and waved Garcia over to Manuel. “Thanks bro. Can you ask him about the accident?” Two minutes of rapid Spanish later, Garcia responded, “He had the green, turning right, I guess the other guy tried to beat the red, Manuel didn’t see him and he clipped him.” “Makes sense,” said Taz. “Ask him about his passenger. I’m pretty sure she was a prostitute.” More Spanish ensued, punctuated with several references to the discotheque and the occasional English “just friend” and “just give her ride”. Garcia pulled a face. “I mean, it’s what you’d expect – they’re just friends, known her for not too long, met her at the bar tonight, taking her wherever.” “Okay, can you keep working on him, see if he’ll admit to the prostitution aspect? I’m gonna talk to this guy over here.” Garcia nodded and continued his questioning. “Let’s go talk to…” Taz looked at the red paper again. “Ishrat? Oud? I don’t even know. I think his middle name is Mohammed.” He paused. “That always works, they always have a Mohammed in their name somewhere.” \n\n“Okay, so what’s your name, guy?” Taz queried. “Um, I…sorry. You…” He started pantomiming a pen and paper. Taz handed him his notebook and his pen. The guy started digging around in his glove box with the pad in hand. “No, buddy. Your name. I’m Taz.” He pointed at himself. “That’s homerunman.” He pointed at me. “You.” He pointed at the driver. “Oh! Mohammed!” he said. Taz looked at me with an ‘I told you so’ glance. Mohammed kept digging in the glove box. “Hey. Mohammed. Can you write? Can you put your name, and your birthday, and your address?” Mohammed stopped. “Sorry. I change tire.” He started to get up to go work on the car again. Taz put up a hand. “Hang on. I need to know who you are.” Mohammed, clearly frustrated, began digging in the glove box again. “Dude, oh my God, fuck this,” Taz mumbled. “Should we call the Language Line?” I asked. Taz shook his head. “I’m not gonna call the stupid Language Line. I just want him to speak English.” Well, that’s clearly not happening anytime soon, I thought to myself. Another unit went screaming past to another gunfire call, causing Mohammed to perk up and watch. Taz tried to get his attention. “Hey. Do you have insurance? Geico? State Farm? Nationwide?” Mohammed harrumphed. “You….I don’t….one moment.” He thought for a second. I could see a vein in Taz’s neck start to pop out. Might as well do something if neither of them won’t, I thought to myself. I fished out my phone and pulled up Google translate. Mohammed saw this and excitedly pulled out his phone as well, and began hammering away in Arabic. After some furious typing, he had made his phone produce a string of gibberish, which he nervously showed us. “La yumkinuk….what?” Taz said as he read. Mohammed shook his head and took his phone back. I quickly typed out [Do you have any car insurance?] and showed Mohammed. Mohammed replied he did and went back to the glove box, where he promptly produced his registration and a receipt from an electronics store. “Just give me everything,” Taz said, pointing at the glove box. “I’ll find it.” After extracting reg, insurance, and a title, he handed everything back and returned to the cruiser.\n\n“I’m so over this bullshit, dude,” he complained. “I’m just giving them him a ticket for running the red and for no license and he can deal with it in court through a translator.” He fished out his ticket book and started to fill in some boxes as Garcia knocked on the window. “Hey, your buddy there just waved me over. He wanted to give your notebook back, and he gave you a little present.” He flipped it open to a page near the back. “He put all his info after all! Name, DOB, address, even a phone and a…sanguine? Zero plus?” “Blood type,” I offered. High school French did pay off, it turned out. “I guess he’s O positive, if that’s even a blood type.” Taz took the pad and looked it over. “At least I can actually fill out the ticket now. I better go double check to see if this all matches up to…something.” We walked back over to Mohammed, who was removing his spare tire. “Dude, it’s not going to work. You can’t drive it. We called a tow truck.” Taz was clearly frustrated. “Sorry, I fix it….and go.” Before Taz could complain to me or Garcia any further, I tapped Taz on the shoulder. “Hang on, dude. I got it.” I pulled out my phone again, typed [Your car is too damaged to drive,] and hit Arabic. Mohammed looked at my phone, at the car, back at the phone, and back to Taz. “…..No?” Taz shook his head. “Nope.” Mohammed sighed. “Tow….how much?” “Whatever the tow truck guy says, I don’t know,” Taz replied. This clearly did not register, so I stepped in again. [It’s not our decision,] I wrote. [The tow truck man will know.] Mohammed thought, then nodded. Garcia pulled Taz aside. “Hey dude, they need me back on the Westside. Are you good with the other guy?” Taz nodded and Garcia jogged to his car to leave.\n\nTaz waved him up the curb as the tow guy pulled up. “Is this your information?” Mohammed pointed at the notebook. “This my….my name, birsday…house. Why trouble, me?” “Because you have no license,” Taz told him. “No, I….give you!” Mohammed angrily pointed at his red laminated paper. Taz began to splutter about identification as I pulled out my phone again, clearly the only viable option at this point for communication. [You don’t have an American license,] I wrote. [That is not valid in America.] “Wait,” Mohammed said. After digging through his wallet, he proudly product…a learner’s permit. “Great,” Taz remarked. “This…actually, this is helpful.” He studied the permit. He looked at my phone. “Actually, the phone thing isn’t bad either.” He thought for a second. “Hey, see if you can ask him about the accident.” [How did the accident happen?] I asked. He looked at my phone with its English keyboard and promptly produced his own once again. [I have green he come to hit mahrat side,] he showed me. Clearly, this was not an entirely perfect method of communication, but now we were getting somewhere. “I think he’s saying he thought he had green and just got clipped,” I relayed. Taz nodded along. “That’s kinda what I figured. Cool. Can you explain to him that he doesn’t have a license?” “I got it,” I said. [You know you don’t have a license?] I wrote. Mohammed looked puzzled. [It’s a learning permit, not a full license.] Mohammed began typing. [Assumed driving but exam puppy?] I read this out loud to Taz, who looked thoroughly confused. “You think he thinks because you can drive after you take the test, he’s good to go?” I shrugged. “Maybe. You think he took the test already?” Taz looked at my phone. “Shit, dude, ask him. Dunno.” [Have you taken the driving exam yet?] I asked. Mohammed read and shook his head. [You can’t drive alone until you do.] Mohammed read again and nodded. “Okay,” he said. Taz looked up from the tickets. “You told him he can’t drive?” I nodded. “Can you explain that he’s got court?” \n\nThis is gonna go over well, I thought to myself. [You are getting two tickets,] I wrote. [One for no license.] Mohammed nodded. [One for running the red light.] Mohammed shook his head and began typing. [Of unjust!] “Great, now he’s figured out how to complain about the ticket,” I said. Taz chuckled. Mohammed showed me his phone again. [Can make sure he drove myself but wrong?] I read it out loud to Taz. “I think he wants to argue that he had the green, and that Manuel was in the wrong. Should I tell him to take it up in court?” Taz nodded. “That’s what I would do.” [You are disagreeing with us?] Mohammed nodded. [That’s okay.] [If you want to argue, you can do it in court.] Mohammed nodded, then asked [What court?]. Taz handed him the tickets, and I pointed to the court date. [You have to go to this place on this day.] Mohammed though about it before asking “February? Twenty five?” Taz and I nodded. “500 North Street,” Taz added. Mohammed nodded. “Ask him to sign real quick.” [Please sign here.] Mohammed looked nervous. “Give him the whole not admission of guilt spiel, you know how that works right?” Unfortunately, I did from experience, so I tried my best. [It does not mean you are guilty. It just means you will go here when it says to.] Mohammed signed as the tow truck finished loading his car. [Do you need to get your stuff?] Mohammed nodded and began to type again, only to have his phone die.\n\nHe looked at us quickly. “Char-jer? Android? Char-jer?” In all the confusion, we’d forgotten he could speak French too, but the sudden accent reminded us. “Hey, just get your stuff,” Taz said. Mohammed climbed onto the back of the tow truck. “When he gets done, get him to call a ride. Oh, and ask him about the guy whit the bag or whoever, that was weird.” Mohammed clambered back down, clutching a pack of gum and a GPS. [Do you have someone to call to get you? We can loan you a charger.] “Une charger?” Mohammed asked, now switching to full-on French. After plugging in his phone, I asked him “I thought you spoke French – why not do that? Vous parlez Francais, no?” He nodded and said “Only little bit. Francais, oui, mais….pas bein.” “Should I just ask him stuff in French now? At least he can respond that way without his phone,” I asked Taz, now filling out insurance exchange forms and almost entirely disinterested. “If you can understand him, go for it. Figure out what was up with the guy.” I shrugged and started to think about how to phrase my question with my limited high school French. “*There was a guy, with a red bag? You gave him all your money. Why?*” I asked in what I hoped wasn’t too broken French. Mohammed thought before replying “*The black guy? I gave him my bag. For…security. Money too.*” “*It looked like maybe a pizza bag. That was yours?*” Mohammed shook his head. “*No, I ordered…eat? Dinner. I ordered dinner?*” Now it was my turn to stop and think. “*Was it your pizza bag?*” Mohammed nodded. “Oui.” “*Did someone else order it? Your bag of food. You didn’t order?*” Mohammed hemmed and hawed. “No….” “*So are you the pizza guy? You deliver pizza?*” “Oui.” I turned to Taz. “Dude, he’s the pizza guy. He was giving his stuff to another driver to finish his run.” Taz got out of his car. “That’s a pizza place I don’t want to order from, then. Damn. Hey, nice job by the way. I’m glad you were here, I would have just started shouting at him.” I smiled a little. “Glad to help.”\n\n“Hey, can you come translate the insurance swap real quick?” Taz asked. I sighed. So much for staying uninvolved.\n",

        "text": "If you think police write tickets for revenue, you've never worked a week on a highway.\n\n\nI was at the scene of a school bus hit and run crash. One of my beat partners showed up to help since these are a paperwork nightmare. While on scene, another crash came out on my beat. It was a crash with injuries, blocking the fast lane on the freeway. Two of my beat partners rolled out to that, while I finished up the school bus paperwork.\n\nWhen I finally got to the freeway crash, they had cleared the road with the help of some tow trucks. While pulling up to it, I saw a tire with the brake calipers and an axle attached, lying on the side of the road. That was a good indicator that it was a decent hit.\n\nIt turns out no one was hurt aside from being a bit sore. Brief summary: Four cars involved. Heavy traffic, 10mph. Carpool lane is mostly open, going 50mph. Guy in heavy traffic goes to make a lane change from slower traffic to the carpool lane. But he failed to look to see if it was clear before he made the lane change. He got about halfway into the carpool lane before someone in the lane plowed into his car. Two other innocent drivers were involved as a result.\n\nThis is where the tickets come in. The guy trying to make a lane change into the carpool lane had one occupant. It was illegal for him to go into that lane to begin with.\n\nThe driver who plowed into him? Unlicensed. Some late 20-year-old lady who just never had a license. If she hadn't been driving when she wasn't allowed to be, the crash never would have happened.\n\nThe more experience I get, the fewer warnings I give.",

        "text": "4 years ago, I was driving a 1993 Peugeot 205. Once upon a time, it had been red, and was still recognizable as such, though it was pretty beat up.\n\nOne day in spring I was going down a 1 way road in the city center of a medium sized city in the Netherlands. I mention it is in the Netherlands, as guns are rarer here than in a lot of other countries. Police officers carry them but plenty of police officers go through their entire career without drawing it even once. Anyway, this road had a canal on the left side with a low (perhaps 10cm/4 inches high) barrier in front of it, and a few restaurants, cafés and stores on the right side. The street was narrow. In theory you could go 30 km/hour there, but I didn't feel safe going any faster than 20. I was also coming up to an - equally narrow - side road. Here, have a very pro sketch in MS Paint of the situation: http://imgur.com/0NFXEsT \n\nAs you can see in the image, there was a police car behind me (It wasn't actually that colour though). I wasn't worried though, as I knew I had done nothing wrong. Suddenly another police car pulls out of the side road and blocks the road. Officers get out of both the car in front and the car behind me (2 out of each car), with their guns pulled. They told me to get out of the car with my hands up, etc. \n\nMy instinct was to duck. It is a stupid thing to do I guess, and I stopped myself, while I was already sort of hunched over on my way to ducking. Then I put my hands up. An officer came to the car door, pulled it open, told me to get out, put me up against the car and handcuffed me. \n\nThey asked me questions such as \"Where is the gun?\" and \"Where is the money you stole?\". They were very persistent but I had no idea what they were talking about. After a while, they (and I) pieced together what had happened. They had gotten a call about an armed robbery. They got a description of the getaway car. The description was \"An old, red, beat up Peugeot\" and the license plate started with GB. My car matched the description perfectly. 100%. But I was innocent. I didn't meet the description of the person they were looking for though; they were looking for a small, muscular guy in his 30s and I'm a very tall, slightly overweight man in (at that time) my early 20s. So after confirming I didn't let anyone else use my car, they sent me on my way.\n\nBefore they sent me away they gave my full license plate to dispatch to note down as \"this guy didn't do it\". The officers were very apologetic about it. They bought me a coffee at one of the nearby cafés so I could recover from the shock. A few days later I got a bunch of flowers sent to my home. It was from the police officers' superior. It came with an invite to an event for me and 3 others to come and watch the dealings of the local police for a day. I went with some friends and it was a very nice day. The police here know how to apologize, and they do great work.\n\nBut damn, having guns pulled on you is a scary experience. ",

        "text": "This story is from a few years ago, and honestly one of the scariest moments of my life. I consider it one of my greatest achievements to have not shat myself this particular evening.\n\n\nSo earlier in the day I had picked up a lady friend of mine to come spend the day with me at my place. After a great and relaxing day, it came time to take her back to her place. At this point its about 10:30-11 at night. We turn out of my driveway and down my street and as we approach the stop sign at the end of the road I see a local police cruiser pass by, nothing out of the ordinary. As I turn onto the street that goes to the main road through down I notice a  few more city police cruisers along with two State Troopers. Now I know something is up, but I'm not sure what. Then I get to the bottom of the hill where State Troopers have blocked the two side streets and one is sitting sideways in the street. I of course come to a complete stop, preparing to find an alternate route out. The next moment is without a doubt the most frightening thing I have ever experienced, and I have been less than a hundred feet from a tornado. \n\n\nA State Trooper steps out from behind the sideways cruiser, with his shotgun aimed right at me. My blood chills, my stomach plummets, my brain comes to a screeching halt. My adrenaline goes into overdrive as I realize that I have a gun pointed at me for the first time in my life and despite knowing that I had done nothing wrong, part of my brain knows that if he pulls that trigger its GAME OVER for me. \n\n\n&gt;\"LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!!\"\n\n\nBoth me and my lady friend raise our hands immediately, making sure they are well within the officer's view.\n\n\n&gt;\"ROLL DOWN YOUR WINDOW!\"\n\n\nI quickly do so and return my hands where he can see them. He steps to the side of my vehicle and keeps his shotgun trained on me through my window as he speaks. \n\n\n&gt;\"ARE YOU THE ONLY TWO IN THE VEHICLE?!\"\n\n\nI somehow found the ability to speak.\n\n\n&gt;\"Y-yes sir!\"\n\n\n&gt;\"ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE?!\"\n\n\n\"&gt;Y-yes sir!\"\n\n\n&gt;\"ALRIGHT! GO AROUND MY CRUISER SLOWLY, AND DO NOT RETURN TO THIS AREA UNTIL IT HAS BEEN CLEARED!! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?!\"\n\n\n&gt;\"Yes sir!\"\n\n\nI did not need to be told twice. I slowly went around his cruiser and took my lady friend home. I then went to the local Walmart and camped out in the parking lot, listening to some random comedy station on my phone until a friend messaged me an all clear. Turns out someone had shot a man, and then fled into the area I live in. I know the officer was doing his job, and if that guy had somehow got in my car I would have been thankful for the officer doing it. Still it doesn't lessen the amount of fear that comes with having someone aiming a shotgun at you, finger on trigger. I have unending respect for anyone who volunteers to be on the other side of that gun, possibly getting guns aimed at them on a regular basis. ",

        "text": "AKA the exciting parts of the job /s\n\nSo all I'm doing is walking the wing.  All this consists of a lot of walking and telling inmates to uncover their cell fronts with random questions that I don't know the answer to.  A bunch of shit that should be told to the bosses working the wing but because I have shit on my collar... they think they'll have better luck with someone actually caring.\n\nSo I'm walking.  I'm all the way up on 4 row and it's the 3rd wing I've walked.  I'm huffing a little as I start down the run.  Nothing unusual so far.  They've just shook down the wing so lots of stopping and listening to inmates bitch about what contraband was taken.\n\n402 when I walked by was laying on his bunk.  When I'm walking back by him, he's standing up.  \"HEY SARGE, SARGE... look at my bird.\"\n\nAnd I don't see it immediatly because first I'm looking for his hands to make sure they're not on his dick.  And then there up on his shoulder is a little bird.\n\nJust chilling out and I think to myself this poor bird looks like this inmate, just a touch of thrown off.  It's got its head turned and it's looking at me out of the corner of its eye.\n\nSo of course my reaction is.  \"Holy shit you actually got a bird.\"\n\nAnd this inmate is a proud man right now.  Which explains why he got the urge to show me.  I've heard of inmates catching birds as pets, I just haven't seen it yet.  \n\nThen my mind goes to important things like \"Hold on, How'd you manage to keep it?\"  Which he doesn't answer, unsurprisingly.\n\nInstead he tells me how he got it in the dayroom and while the boss did shake him out coming out of the dayroom the boss let him keep it.  Now I guess he could have gotten it that day.  But this bird was acting pretty tame.\n\nSo onto more important questions. \"What the hell are you feeding it?\"\n\nTuna.\n\n\"Dude it needs worms and bugs and shit... I don't know.\"  I'm honestly just glad he's not feeding it chicken.\n\nIf the bird dies I'll figure it'll be more incentive for the other birds to not get caught.  They know better.\n\nSo onward I go to finish my walks.  I got a few more wings to hit up before I get a chance to stare at my paperwork in a state of agony.\n\n3 row is uneventful.  315 has built a trench with soap on his toilet and wall because his button is leaking.  Let me finish walking and I'll find maintenance.\n\nThen I hit 2 row.  And I'm in ninja mode.  Not on purpose, I just walk quiet.  213 has a fishing line down to 1 row.  I don't know which way it's going but HAH imma catch it.\n\nAnd I do.  Right before the little note and empty bag of tortillas make it into 213.  213 starts going oh man sarge I didn't know you were here blah blah.  It's always the same thing I barely listen.  Instead I bend down to see what they're passing.\n\nAnd inside that fucking tortilla bag... is a fucking snake.\n\nNow remember I'm a female working in a male prison.  So you'll understand what exploded from my mouth probably wasn't the best thing.\n\n\"OH MY GOD THAT'S A SNAKE\"\n\nThe inmate starts telling me yeah and he just didn't want it taken during the shake down so he'd had his buddy on 1 row hold it.  He's absolutely lying to me.  1 row was shook down after 2 row.  Oh well, lying over a little grass snake isn't going result in the end of the world.\n\nNow I could confiscate the snake and go and let it go outside.  I've already got the little note with the stamp... and this option means I have to fuck with the snake.  \n\nI have a bad track record when fucking with critters.  The last time I confiscated one it was a huge black widow kept in an empty peanut butter jar.  The inmate had even given this spider peices of string and shit to climb on.  And it was huge.  And while I was walking down the run I almost dropped the thing.\n\nSo I quickly decide I'm not going to fuck with the snake.  It's a lil grass snake and letting him keep it let's him think I let him make it.  And I don't have to touch the snake.",

        "text": "I got a call of a roll over crash. A car went off the freeway and landed on its wheels, taking out a light pole in the process. This happened to be on a freeway where no one knows what direction they're going or what exit is nearby, so it took me a couple wrong locations provided by witnesses to find it.\n\nI came upon the scene with the rolled over vehicle down a 10 foot ditch, and another involved car stopped along the shoulder. No big injuries, just some minor cuts. Based on statements, damage to the vehicles, and tire friction marks (skidmarks) on the road, it was pretty obvious what happened.\n\n[A quick diagram.](http://i.imgur.com/Ye03kd4.jpg) One car was in the fast lane and realized his exit was coming up. So he cut across the freeway to make his exit. In the process, he clipped the front of the other car in the slow lane. Madness ensued, some cars rolled, and an innocent light pole needed replacing.\n\nWhile we were clearing the scene, we had the exit blocked. A few other officers arrived to help. Once the tow truck finally had the car hooked up we started to slowly open the exit back up. I was the last patrol car on scene. I was typing some notes when another officer went over the car-to-car radio and said, \"2BlueZebras, right behind you.\" I looked in my mirror and saw a car doing *exactly the same thing* that led to this crash. Better yet, this new driver cut in right behind the tow truck with the rolled over car on it.\n\nI stopped her for a chat. \"Good evening, ma'am. The reason I stopped you was because you crossed the divided section of the road back there.\" She responded, \"Yeah, it was my exit, and I wasn't sure if I could take it, but I saw you were opening it up again, so I thought I could make it.\" \n\nOut of curiosity, and to prove a point, I asked, \"Did you happen to see the car on the truck in front of you, with all the crash damage?\" \n\n\"Yeah, I saw that.\"\n\n\"That happened because they did *exactly* what you just did. Driver's license, registration, and insurance, please.\"\n\nI don't give warnings on that one anymore.\n",

There's a lot of guys that serve us overseas and come home hurt, not always physically.  For them, and for us in Law Enforcement, there can still be a taboo about getting help.  I beg of you, get help if you need it.  To those who have served, thank you.*\n  \nThey're behind me again.  \n  \nThese people have been stalking me for five years.  Ever since I got home.  They want revenge, not that I blamed them.  I did what I had to do, but the guilt still gets to me every once in a while.   \n  \nIt started in Afghanistan.  It was my fifth month there.  At least I was going home soon.  I've been lucky enough to avoid any serious fighting so far.  \n  \nI kept trying to be a good person.  Even if some of these people were truly evil, or at the very least the enemy, they were still people.  A lot of people I work with have forgotten that.  I didn't want to.  \n  \nOur convoy was making it through one of the many villages that dotted the Afghan countryside.  All of a sudden my hearing was muffled and I was on my side.  They trained us for a possible IED, but it's completely different to be hit by one.  \n  \nMy best buddy was with me.  He was from my hometown.  I needed to make sure he was okay.  I picked myself up.  I could hear firecrackers.  \n  \nWait, that's gunfire.  \n  \nThere's my buddy.  I have to get him up and into the fight.  I grab his shoulder.  It's limp.  I look into his eyes.  They're vacant.  He's gone.  \n  \nThey're not people anymore.  They've killed him.  \n  \nEverything else was a blur.  I picked up my rifle and returned fire.  Others in the convoy was also returning fire.  I don't know how long it took, but eventually it stopped.  Most of us were still up.  Some of us joined my friend.  \n  \nLetting my rifle hang limply in my hand I walked numbly through the village.  So many of them dead.    \n  \nI catch the eyes of a wounded villager.  He looked at me with pure hatred.  Then they were blank.  \n  \nI have to remember, these are the enemy.  They're not people.  \n  \nThey followed me home.  My wife kept asking me what was wrong.  I wasn't allowed to tell her.  I can't let her in on the danger either.  The terrorists attacked us at home, I don't want her to be a target.  \n  \nI didn't even leave the airport yet.  I saw his eyes follow me.  It was a villager.  I have to get this uniform off.  I'll be less visible.  \n  \nOver the years I've seen them.  Multiple people.  I've always been told to keep an eye on my surroundings.  I bet they don't even know I'm on to them.  I've been acting as normal as I can.  I'm not sure who to turn to.  My wife is the only person I can trust right now.  \n  \nShe keeps saying I've changed.  Well, honey, I had to.  There are so many people who want to hurt us out there.  I have to keep you safe.  \n  \nWe went on a breakfast date today.  We wanted to take the motorcycle, but the roads were still wet from the on and off rain.  We had a nice time.  But I noticed them following us on the way home.  \n  \nFinally, I made a decision.  I'd take the fight to them.  \n  \nMy wife is napping now.  I left her and grabbed my rifle.  I didn't want to hurt too many of them, just scare them off maybe. I wasn't even a mile away from home when they pulled me over.  \n  \nI can surprise them.  Maybe I can keep my wife safe after all.   ",

        "text": "I was on patrol when I stopped to help a disabled motorist on the freeway. He was an elderly gentleman in a vehicle that just got a flat tire. He let me know the car was a rental, and he had roadside assistance on the way. He requested I wait until they showed up since we were on the side of the busy freeway, so I intended to do just that.\n\nI let dispatch know what I was up to, \"Unit 2 to dispatch. I'll be standing by with a disabled vehicle unless a higher priority call comes out.\" Dispatch echoed my transmission. Higher priority would be something like a crash, a pedestrian on the freeway, a fight, and anything increasing in danger from there. I sat behind the disabled vehicle for a few minutes until a higher priority call came out.\n \nProtip: if you ever see State Police running, something is going down.  \"Attention all Valley units, we're getting reports from Springfield PD of an active shooter at the mall. They're requesting all allied agencies to respond.\"\n\nI ran out of my car up to the disabled driver. \"I apologize, sir, but an urgent call has come out that required my attention. I'll be back to check on you as soon as I can.\" I then proceeded to book it back into my car and over to the mall. Unfortunately, I was as far away from that location as I could have been.\n\nWhile en route, dispatch provided an update, \"Springfield PD is requesting State units to block all nearby on-ramp and off-ramp access.\"\n\nOne unit goes on scene before me, and he puts out that he's blocking the off-ramp going westbound. I show up, rack my rifle, sling it over my shoulder, and put out that I'm blocking the off-ramp going eastbound. I get out to set up flares while my patrol vehicle is sideways across the ramp to keep people from going by.\n\nProtip #2: If you see State Police with a rifle, you shouldn't go where they're trying to block. While laying flares I watched a pick-up truck go off-road, around my patrol car, and down the ramp I was blocking. His funeral.\n\nA couple minutes later my flares are set up and I'm posted by where the pick-up went off-roading to keep a copy-cat from following. We ended up getting the all-clear as the suspects had fled the scene. I started picking the flares up to open the ramp. A moment later a white van pulled over on the right shoulder, and a not un-attractive, young blonde woman ran over to me. She started with, \"Hi, I'm from ABC News.\" I just looked at her, \"Okay.\" She continued, \"Can I go that way?\" At least she stopped to ask, but it was all clear at that point anyway. \"Yep, go ahead.\"\n\nI found out a little later that it was two people, both armed, who got in an argument with each other and decided shooting was the appropriate response. No one was injured.",

More pay than patrol, somewhat normalized hours, and the fancy title of \"Special Agent.\"  \n  \nI say normalized hours...but we really are on an \"on call\" basis. For the most part, though, I usually work 8AM to 5PM.  It isn't bad for a state agency.  Unfortunately, last night was one of the exceptions.  \n  \nIt's been a rainy few days.  While the rain hasn't been constant, it was just enough to be annoying and make sure everything remained wet.  Unfortunately, the criminals don't stop on account of being wet.  I was called out at 1AM last night to work a gang homicide.  My wife wasn't very happy with me.  Oh well, it's the perks of the job.  \n  \nThat's why I was more annoyed than usual when I got another call at around 11AM.  I though my boss would let me come in at 1PM since I worked last night.  Luckily my wife was at work, so I didn't have to see her reaction again.  At least both our children are in college and out of the house.   \n  \n\"Hello?\"  I immediately detected the annoyance in my voice.  If I hadn't just been woken up, I might have cared.  \n  \n\"Have you heard yet?\"  Replied my boss on the other end.  He didn't seem to detect the negativity I knew I was portraying.   \n  \n\"No, asshole, I've been sleeping,\" is what I wanted to say.  Instead, I replied \"What's up?\"  \n  \nWhat he told me snapped me wide awake.  My annoyance drained immediately.  \"I'll be right there.\"  \n  \nThis is a small town.  Most of the population still support Law Enforcement, despite the media circus currently centered around it.  Nobody can deny the fact that more and more of us are being attacked every day.  For the most part, though, it happened elsewhere.  \n  \nNot today.  Today one of our own has been shot.  And now my job is to figure out what happened.  \n  \nI got my suit on and clipped my weapon and badge on my belt.  I didn't bother showering or shaving.  I wanted to get there fast.  I'm not usually this urgent.  \n  \nGod, one of our own.  I hope the kid's going to be okay.  Didn't he tell me the deputy just started?  I know I don't technically work for this agency, but I know a lot of people from it.  Hell, I just had dinner with one of the Majors over there.  We've been good friends for twenty years.  \n  \nThe Deputy's name didn't sound familiar to me.  There are a lot of new guys coming to law enforcement lately.  I haven't had the chance really to meet all of them in my area.  \n  \nIt seemed like traffic was not on my side today.  I was getting progressively angrier every red light I hit.  Finally, for what seemed like hours (it was more like 15 minutes) I finally got there.  The entire street was blocked off with yellow tape.  I saw the squad car behind another vehicle.  A white tarp covering the body of the suspect.  \n  \nI saw the Lieutenant of the shift on scene.  We exchange pleasantries.  He looks angry.  I am too.  He points me out to another deputy on scene.  \n  \nOh Jesus, the kid was still in FTO.  \n  \nI went to talk to him.  He can barely contain himself as he lets me know what happened.  I have to wait a bit every few minutes for him to collect himself.  Finally he finished.  He asked me if he could head to the hospital.  He wants to be with him.  \n  \nI let his Sergeant know that I didn't need him on scene anymore as long as I could call him if I needed him.  He got a ride with someone else to go to the hospital.  \n  \nIt's going to be really hard to remain impartial to this case.  \n  \nI examined the patrol car.  There was surprisingly few bullet holes in it.  The FTO wasn't sure how many shots the suspect got off, but he mentioned it couldn't have been many.  The driver's side headlight was hit and there was one hole in the still open door.  Through and through.  That may have been the bullet that hit the deputy.  \n  \nI couldn't look at the blood stain for more than a minute.  I just mentally noted it was there.  \n  \nFinally I went to the suspect's vehicle.  I noted the 45 caliber rifle on the ground next to the suspect.  Yeah, that'll go through the vest.  God dammit.  \n  \nI pulled the white sheet back and stared into the suspect's still open eyes.  \n  \nWhat happened is the easy part of this case.  I'm going to have a very tough time finding out why, though.  ",

It was the 5th phone I confiscated.  I guess these kids will never learn, even if it's high school.  I sighed as I heard yet another complaint that they *needed* to text their parents (yeah, right).  \n  \nSometimes I just want to borrow my husband's taser.  I'm sure he hears that joke enough though.  \n  \nNow someone is knocking on the classroom door.  I was mid sentence when I had to confront for yet another phone and now I can't even continue it?  Oh, that's the school resource deputy.  I guess he can get the exception.  \n  \nI went in the hallway to talk to him.  He looks really serious.  Oh no.  Please don't be what I'm already thinking.  \n  \nOh God.  \n  \nI don't even remember the trip.  My thoughts were a scramble.  The deputy kept telling me that he's not dead.  He's in surgery now.  But he's in rough shape.  It's not what I wanted to hear, but I appreciate the honesty.  \n  \nThey rushed me there only to have me wait in the lobby.  The deputy had to go back to the school.  He seemed angry about it.  I'm alone now.  Why am I alone?  I don't want to be alone.  \n  \nWho is this person trying to talk to me?  I don't recognize them.  Yes, that's me.  Yes, that's my husband in there, must you remind me?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, sir, I'm glad his Captain is here.   \n  \nCan...can you stay with me?  Thank you.   \n  \nHe was a very nice person.  He just sat there and talked to me about anything.  Asked what I did.  Tried to distract me.  It was still agonizing.  \n  \nOh...here's the doctor.  Oh God there's blood on him.  Is that my husband's blood?  \n  \nHe's stable, for the moment.  But still critical.  What does that mean?  Will he live? At least I can see him now.  \n  \nI shouldn't have gone in.  He was always so logical.  He could always calm me down when I'm stressed or panicky.  He was so good at that.  Now, I see him bandaged up all over.  There were tubes running down his nose and mouth.  I needed his comfort now.  I needed his magical ability to calm me down.  Who is going to do it now?  \n  \nI didn't even notice the multitude of deputies with him.  It seemed like everyone was there.  He was so new, I didn't know he was so liked already.  Or maybe it's just that one of them was hurt, and they all felt like a family.  That's what he always said.  \nI sat down next to him and buried my head in my arms.  The top of my head brushed on his still arm.  I hadn't cried yet.  I am now.  I felt a hand on my shoulder.  Then many.  \nI appreciated them.  But all I wanted was my husband. ",

Little back ground first, I'm a MP with almost 8 years and this by far was one of the funniest and weird incidents in my career. \nSo we get called the the on base hotel (not naming the base for now) which houses soldiers for schools that happen on the base. The call was for a drunk SSG who was getting in a fist fight and that their was blood every where. The dispatch told us the caller was freaking out. We get their and walk in to talk to the front desk clerk. They pointed out back and as we are walking we see no trace of blood any where. So we get out back and find a group of drunk soldiers. One of the was really drunk, stumbling slearing his works. Basically what you would expect from someone who had two or three two many. As we are talking to the group, mind you their is six of us there, he starts to get squrrally. So our supervisor makes the decision to take him back to the station and toss him in a cell to cool down.\nFast forward twenty or so minutes. We place him in the cell and I had just stepped outside to bullshit with another patrol when our desk Sgt rushes out and says the guy is getting violent and kicking the metal door to the holding cell. We all rush back in and try to calm him down. It was decided he would be placed in hand irons and put into a bared cell where I had a bed and couldn't cause anymore problems. As we are putting the handcuffs on I'm am standing behind my partner and the guy is fighting a lot. I pull my taser out just in case. Suspect gets thrown around a little but we eventually get him into the cell. At this point he is trying to buck up and turn on my partner. I was a few seconds away from deploying my taser when I hear \"I have had enough\" I look over my shoulder and see a taser, the pop. The prongs go over me, mid my partner who still has hands on the subject. We both jump back.after the first ride the guy still wanted to fight so he got two more pulls. After the last ride he surrendered and was calm as hell for the rest of the time. Didn't even fight she ems took the prongs out. Needless to say it was a fun night.",

[Link to part 1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/4de070/officer_fiction_thoughts_as_i_fell/)*   \n    \n\nTen years.  I've been doing this job for ten years.  I've seen shit you wouldn't believe.  I've seen nasty dead bodies, ones that TV would never show.  I've been in foot chases more than I can count.  I've seen people do horrible things.  I've had to arrest a recruit I was training.     \n  \n\nBut I've never had to fire my gun.  Not until this subject fired a rifle at us.    \n  \n\nI didn't even realize what was happening until the suspect was down.  My gun was in my hands.  Wait, when did I draw it?  \n10 minutes ago I was at this nice little old ladies house.  My recruit had just finished changing the battery on her smoke detector.  I remember those days.  Gung ho to do anything I could do.  I wanted to get out there and make a difference.  New to the job with a smile on my face.  I've stopped caring as much.  I've seen too many shitheads.  Smelled too many of the homeless.  Told too many people over and over again that they still can turn their lives around, just to see them killed in some gang shootout.    \n  \n\nI would have changed the smoke detector too, but only because I had to.  He did it because he actually wanted to help.  I liked him for that.     \n\nYeah, he can get hot headed.  What cop doesn't?  He was in the reserves for a while.  Actually made my job easy.  He knew a lot of stuff already.  I had to convince him he didn't know everything, though.  But it's rare you see so many people out there to legitimately help people.  Most of the guys I know just do the job.   \nThe suspect fell, taking his rifle with him.  Good, we got him before he got us.  I clicked my mic \"Unit, shots fired.  Suspect is down.  Roll EMS.\"  I looked over to my recruit.  \"You good buddy?\"   \n  \nNo response.   \n  \nI asked louder.  Maybe he couldn't hear me over the rain.  Then it dawned on me.   \n\n\"OFFICER DOWN OFFICER DOWN\"   \n  \nThe radio blaired in a symphony of tones.  I rushed to the other side of the car.  The trauma kit was already in my hand.  Wait, it was between the seats, when did I get it?  \n  \n\"Buddy, you're gonna be okay.\"  I saw red bubbles from his chest.  No thinking, just do it. I used the scissors in the pack to cut the uniform.   \n  \n\"FUCK\"  \n  \nIt wouldn't cut through the kevlar.  Kevlar that was useless today.  \n  \nI cut the straps and ripped off the vest.  He gurgled, his eyes wide.  I couldn't tell too well, but I didn't see fear in them.  Anger maybe? I put the occlusive dressing on the entry wound.  I put my hands on his back.  There was an exit wound.  I flipped him over and put the other dressing in the double pack on it.  I noticed the bullet stopped in the other side of his vest.  Goddamn useless piece of junk.   \n  \nI heard sirens.  Good.  I did all I could do.  I think.  I kept talking to him.  C'mon buddy, c'mon man.  Stay with me.  You got that wife to go home to.   \n  \nOur zone partner put his hand on my shoulder and pulled me out of the way for the medics to get there.  That's when I realized I wasn't talking.  I was sobbing.   \n  \nThey put him in the ambulance.  I went to step on board.  Sarge held me back.  He needed me here.  Wait, when did Sarge get here?   \n  \nI needed to go with him.  Yesterday, I told him there was no routine traffic stop.  Today I told him to just get out and let the guy know his brake light was broken.  I told him to relax.  Like it was a routine stop.   \n  \nTen years I've been doing this job.  Today was the first time I truly failed at it. ",

        "text": "*Disclaimer - I've been going though a lot of crap lately, and some of it shows here.  Normally I don't let my emotions get to me, but I needed to get some shit off my chest about recent life events and all the officer downs we've had lately.  So I wrote.  It helped.  I wanted to share it with you guys.  I have more ideas from this nameless character that I might work on if people are really interested in it.  But here's the first chapter for now.*   \n \nMy first thought was \"That motherfucker hurt.\"  The asshole surprised us at his traffic stop.  \n  \nMy second thought was \"Why is this dude shooting at us for a fucking broken brake light?\"  \n  \nI was trying to keep my gun raised.  My FTO was on the other side of the vehicle returning fire.  I was always told to keep fighting, even if you're hit.  Well I was obviously hit.  The pain told me that.  The vest should have stopped it though, so I'm fine.  But I was dizzy , and it was pissing me off. I didn't even know I fell.   \n  \nI noticed it was hard to draw air in one of my lungs. Shit, that means I probably have a puncture.  Which means it went through the vest.  It was going to be hard to fight back.  I worked that hard all my life to get this at the beginning of my career?  I guess this is when my life flashes before my eyes.  Or something like that.    \n  \nMaybe it'll just be the past few years.  The academy was pretty fun.  Some would say my most vivid memory should have been OC day.  Devil's piss sucks, true.  But I think the day I remember most is when one of my instructors told me he knew I'd make it to law enforcement, about ten minutes before he told the entire class only half of us would make it.    \n  \nSo what did I do after the academy?  I went into the obviously related field of sales.  The related part is a bit sarcastic.  10 hours a day, sitting around all day, dealing with assholes 6 days a week.  Cue the addiction to coffee and fast food.  Maybe it wasn't so sarcastic.    \n  \nI spent two years doing this.  Then I got into the county sheriff's office as a reserve.  Great, I finally became a cop only to do it for free.  Oh well, I love the job.  But now I have obligations to this, plus my 60+ hours a week.  Don't forget social obligations.  Oh yeah, and my wife.    \n  \nI married young.  God bless her.  It's hard being a cop wife.  It's harder being a cop wife to someone that was previously completely absent of self-confidence and was now overcompensating.  I always refused to cook.  I was decent at it, but I just hated doing it.    \n  \nNow that I'm thinking about it, I should have cooked more.    \n  \nDamn though.  She is hot.  And she supports Law Enforcement.  The Black Lives Matter protests pissed her off.  Everyone always assuming cops were the bad guys out to kill black people.  She knew better.  I've pissed her off, obviously, but you should see her around that.  It's like a fucking political speech by Donald Trump.  \n  \nHell, I didn't understand the protests too well.  I just wanted to do the job.  Everyone I know just wanted to do the job.  We didn't care who we pulled over.  I didn't even know his race until he started shooting at us.  But I digress.    \n  \nMan this job is changing me.  I used to be shy and reserved.  Ultra religious and clean.  Now I make dirty jokes.  I made a stupid joke about one of the guy's wives.  She looked at his texts and caught it.  Friended me on facebook just to yell at me for it.  I honestly felt really bad.  Sent me into a depressive episode out of guilt.  I went into work today still in it.  If I make it though this stupidity, I'll make sure to watch my humor from now on.    \n  \nMan does this hurt.  Is my FTO okay?  I think the shooting stopped.  My hearing is going in and out.  \n  \nAnyway, I quit the sales job a few months ago.  I never got to see my wife.  She makes enough money for us to live on, even if it's tight.  It's worth it, right?  Shit though, we got into a lot of credit card debt.  I should have stayed.  She disagrees of course, but all I can see is this crushing debt.  \n  \nWell, they gave me a part time job at the Sheriff's Office.  The command staff at the Reserves saw some potential in me.  Even though the agency kept turning me down for full time positions, citing me as immature (they were right, judging by my bad joke mentioned earlier), they believed in me.  I wish I could show them the appreciation.   \n  \nRemember that I mentioned I overcompensated for a lack of self-confidence?  That showed in the part time job, which ending up being a sort of “discovery period” where the agency kept a close eye on me.  I kept trying to prove myself.  I always had to fight for every step I took.  Finally the Sergeants and Lieutenant of the unit took me aside and told me of my stupidity.  God that embarrassed me, but it sent me straight.  A few months later, I finally got hired on after 4 years of trying.    \n  \nIn house was fun.  God the taser sucked though.  That's all I'll say about that.    \n  \nThen came FTO.  With how much I rode as a reserve, FTO was pretty easy so far.  I had to write a lot of paper this morning.  Comes with the territory. An old lady called us when she fell off her chair.  We got there and helped her up.  She asked us nicely to change her smoke detector battery.  She wouldn't let me go without hugging me, telling me that this anti-LEO climate is bullshit (her words, I swear) and I need to stay safe.  I promised her I would do my best.  This job wasn't so bad.  I could do this.  I could love this.    \n  \nOn our way out of that call, we found a car with a broken brake light.  Tag came back clean, let's just let him know.    \n  \n",

        "text": "Streams of muddy brown water framed either side of the Barrio’s busiest main road. My rain gear was doing a poor job of keeping me dry but it was better than Nick’s utter lack of preparation. The spring shower had snuck up on us, ruining an otherwise prefect day. I watched a Heineken bottle float a few feet towards the storm drain before it got stuck on a gathering of leaves, cigarette butts, junk food wrappers, and a dead pigeon that had formed a sort of peninsula of despair in the depressing river of filth. \n\n“Press-o hard-o por favor. Tu nombre aqui.” Nick’s Spanish was more sign language and frustration than fluent but he got his point across. He loved working traffic for some reason. \n\nThe driver smiled and nodded, clearly happy to just be getting a ticket for a broken tail light in place of Nick digging more into his lack of a valid driver’s license, and scribbled on the damp summons. \n\n“Tu dia of corte aqui.” Nick pointed to the date the driver needed to either pay the ticket or appear in court. “Comprende?” \n\nIt didn’t really matter if he did or not. A little fix-it ticket for an illegal immigrant without a license was of no concern to the court, but issuing it made both Nick and our bosses happy – proof he was doing his job and active instead of just parking his car in some hidden spot and waiting for a dispatch like he was a firefighter or something. \n\n“You done? Road checks in the rain are no bueno.” I told Nick as he scampered back to our position. \n\n“Yeah, yeah. Just because you can’t write traffic doesn’t mean I shouldn’t.” Nick gathered his summons book and clipboard off the ground and shook the water from them in a poor attempt to salvage them. \n\n“Oh really. You think I can’t write tickets to a community where every other car is driven by a dude with no license. I’m not about the petty crap, man. I’m looking for the big fish.”\n\n“Psssh, big fish.” Nick’s car was parked closer than mine and he was already in it and running a pending events query. “Big fish like the drunk guy on hold? Have fun with that. I’m going to go sit on my stop sign and write a few more.”\n\nRivulets of water streamed down my back and I felt a drop gather up the mass needed to allow gravity to pull it from the tip of my nose. “Really? It’s raining you know.”\n\n“Wow. You’re going to be a detective some day!”\n\n“Yeah, well you’re going to work motor detail and write tickets all day. Have fun, trooper!” I stomped back to my car and shed my rain coat before sitting down. As soon as I marked in service from the traffic detail, the dispatcher pounced on me for the drunk call.\n\n“6-Bravo-12, start for a drunk. Caller states a homeless man is in his store refusing to leave and may have stolen some fruit. 1423 hours.”\n\nI wiped my face on the towel I kept in my duty gear and started for my big case. It was only a block away and as I rolled up, the Korean store keeper jogged up to my car. \n\n“He crazy! Eat banana and yell at me and wife. Come, come!” He beckoned me to his bodega and I followed begrudgingly behind. \n\nThe door knocked a small wind chime as he opened it but the tinkling fairy sound was drowned out by angry Korean flowing from the mouth of the shop keeper’s diminutive wife. She was leaning down to the pass-through underneath the bullet proof glass partition and aiming her shrill diatribe at a swaying Hispanic male who while he assessed me and what my presence meant for him.\n\n“Flaco, what’re you doing, man?” Flaco’s flagrant violation of the peace treaty I had brokered a few months earlier between the Barrio’s homeless and business owners annoyed me. \n\n“Comiendo.” He replied, muffled by a mouthful of what, judging by the refuse at his feet, was his third banana. \n\n“Dude. Pay the man and get out of here. I don’t want to go to jail today.”\n\n“Está lloviendo.”\n\n“No crap, but that doesn’t mean you can come in here and eat this guy’s bananas.” I turned to the store owner. “How much are the banana’s?”\n\n“Two twenny-five.” He spat back, glaring angrily at the still chewing Flaco. \n\n“Cough it up, Flaco.”\n\n“No.” He was indignant and looked away from me.\n\n“I really don’t want to do this. It’s a long walk back here from the drunk tank, y’know. Do you really want to make me arrest you?”\n\nFlaco looked back at me and shook his head, confused there wasn’t another option. “No. Ees rrain-ing.” \n\nI sighed and thought of another way to escape having to end my day with a trip to jail and inevitably end up getting home late. I then reached into my pocket and pulled out three dollars. “This’ll cover the bananas, ok?” The store owner happily accepted the cash then turned his attention once more to Flaco. \n\n“Ok but no more in my store!”\n\n“I think that’s fair. Flaco-” I made the sign of the cross to give some gravity to the act of barring him for the premises, “-You are hereby banned from Choi’s Bodega henceforth, under penalty of the law! In the name of the father, son, holy ghost…”\n\nFlaco smiled at my grand presentation and took a step to walk out. \n\n“Thank you sir!” I yelled back to the store owner. “Call back if he trespasses and we’ll handle it! Kamsahamnida!”\n\nFlaco stumbled out of the store into the covered walkway out front. He regarded the rain as though he was the wicked witch of the west, then backed up and leaned against the wall of the bodega. \n\n“No, no.” I scolded. “Not here. Move along.” I passed him, expecting him to comply and stumble away but instead turned to see him shaking his head.\n\n“No. Ees rrain-ing.”\n\n“No crap. Too bad. Move along.” I had opened my door and trying my best to put some command presence into my lawful order. “You’re still technically trespassing.”\n\nFlaco crossed his arms and fumed. “No.”\n\n“Dammit, Flaco, I’m being more than generous here. You have to move along or go to jail. Those are the two options.”\n\nFlaco stomped his foot and turned away from me like a spoiled five year old in Toys R Us being refused a Ninja Turtle. \n\n“Last chance, man.” I warned him, closing my door to add an audible exclamation point. \n\nFlaco just shook his head. \n\nI grumbled obscenities as I stomped in his direction. “Help you out and try and keep you clean… buy your stupid bananas, keep you out of jail and this is what I get. Stupid frigg-”\n\nFlaco swung at me, missing my face by inches as I pulled away at the last minute. I lunged for him and wrapped my arms around his waist and he responded by dropping both fists onto my back. I lifted him up and dropped him to the sidewalk, making sure to come off my feet and add all my weight to his own downwards momentum. I heard the air go out of him and leveraged my head behind his body-odor-drenched shirt, into his back, to attempt to roll him to his stomach. He scrambled backwards in an attempt to escape my grasp, kicking his feet wildly and pushing down on my shoulders with his hands. He was able to free a foot and get it underneath himself and rose up as I repositioned to take his back in a bear hug. We crab-walked together a few steps before I gained the leverage to pick him up and drop him again. This time, I was sure top make him land on his belly and quickly transitioned to an attempt to control one of his arms. I cranked back on his elbow and he groaned but the fight wasn’t out of him yet. A crowd had gathered, mostly homeless and day laborers, but I was more concerned with Flaco’s attempts to bite my hand on his shoulder as he ran prone circles on the sidewalk like one of the Three Stooges.\n\n“Fucking stop!” I yelled at him. \n\n“Rrrraaaaain-iiiing!” He growled between snaps of his teeth. \n\nI set my feet and leaned back with all my weight. A sickening CRACK sounded out and suddenly I fell backwards onto my back, still holding Flaco’s wrist. He groaned in pain and immediately stopped resisting. I paused a moment, too stunned by what had happened to react, before letting go and jumping up. \n\nFlaco rolled to his back and bent his arm at the elbow back in the right direction. He inhaled a hiss of air and I heard the CLICK as his elbow aligned itself again. He tentatively tested the range of motion and after a couple pumps, seemed happy with the status. \n\n“Sorry, sorry.” He said from his back. \n\n“What?”\n\n“Sorry. No fight-ing. Sorry. I go.”\n\n“Wait, no. You… you need an ambulance.”\n\n“No, ees ok.” He flexed his arm again. “See?”\n\n“No. Not ok. I bent your elbow the wrong way.” Flaco waved my statement off like it was of no concern. I heard car brakes behind me and the unmistakable idle of a Crown Vic. The crowd parted and Sarge walked through. \n\n“All good?” He asked me. \n\n“Uh, no. We just fought. I think I broke his elbow.” \n\nSarge looked down at Flaco, then at me. I realized we were both covered in the wet grime from the parking lot. “Ambulancia?” He asked Flaco.\n\nFlaco just shook his head no. \n\n“You gonna charge him with assault on an officer?” \n\nI thought a minute – about the event, the fight, the rain, my commute home in miserable traffic if I didn’t get out of work on time. “Um, no?” I didn’t know if it was a test. “I mean, he was just trespassing.”\n\nThe Sarge nodded a moment. “Sounds like a summons releasable offense to me.”\n\nI hesitantly nodded in agreement then strode to my car to get my summons book. Sarge kept an eye on Flaco as he slowly stood and attempted to wipe himself clean. \n\n“Good fighter.” Flaco told Sarge. \n\n“I’ll be sure to put that on his next eval.” Sarge chuckled back. \n\nI finished the summons and passed Flaco the clipboard. \n\n“Firma tu nombre aqui.” I told him.\n",

        "text": "In the academy, I had a great instructor, a legend in my department, S.W.A.T. qualified and ran multiple operatins, under cover narcotics, and a normal ass kicking ground pounder. He had a lot of hilarious phrases for all manner of bullshit situations but one of his best sayings, \"Put some ketchup on a shit sandwich.\"  \n\nNight shift, it's time to separate the wheat from the chaff, the men from the boys, the awkwardly feminine from the possibly Canadian. \nMy first call of service for the night and I'm with a cranky old officer that is affectionately called the gorilla. He's an asshole to new guys on the job, so of course we are getting along like old friends, the kind from Grumpy Old Men. I hear my radio crackle, business alarm in progress. I hear two units take the call and one of them says, \"Headquarters get me some more units, I got wide open doors and this is a big place, it was a knock off ACME with the same size of building.\n\nI arrive on scene with my cranky old partner and get my gun out, and see one of my buddy's moving forward towards the front managers office. It's a bad spot, he has some cover but has a lot of ground to cover and there is a dreaded hallway that turns into a fatal funnel. My buddy clears the managers office with no incident. I clear the rear of the building, going by the fresh produce section, the meat section into the rear. I clear the back area with another officer, one of my buddy's from the academy. We run tight, checking corners the way our S.W.A.T. members taught us entry and clearing. The building is clear and my buddy checks the camera, \"Shit we got a perp stealing running into the building and, wait... HAHAHAH, the guy tried to break the door down with his foot and fell down. He's limping away. Oh man he's hurt and limping away.\" \n\nI check clear on the radio and let another unit take the report and head back to my vehicle with my gorilla. \n\nMy night is just beginning and its only about to get crazier. A few hours later I hear my radio crackle, possible burglary in progress, complaint states subject is armed and shooting into building. I look at my sleeping partner and hit the gas in my vehicle, hitting a pot hole to wake him up. He has a grumpy tone, \"I heard the radio, don't get into an accident or the department will have our asses, especially yours since you are the inexperienced dumbass driver, did I mention that we are BFF's?\n\nI arrive on scene and go by slowly by our location, it's a church. I make the block and turn around and park right across from the church off to the front left side of the church on the median. I get out of my unit and see a black male limping from the back of the building on the far right side, I have units on the back side of the church and I see the black male limp away from the church and stop by a tree for a moment. My partner and I are in the open median, its a large grassy area dividing two streets as each street is one way. We have our guns out and I start yelling commands, I have my brand new flash light trained on the man's eyes. He's blinded and I scream, \"GET YOUR HANDS UP! GET YOUR ARMS HIGH! HIGHER! SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!\" The man complies, and I walk towards him while separating from my partner and creating distance between us, in case anything happens there are two targets that aren't right next to each other. I yell for the man to turn around. He starts yelling,\"LOOK POLICE BRUTALITY! I'M JUST ANOTHER BLACK MAN BEING ARRESTED! WHY CAUSE I'M BLACK?\" I look at my partner and start grinning, he knows what I'm thinking, my partner is black, he hates cry babies like this perp. \n\nWe have more units show up and search the church. We find damage everywhere, multiple gun shots and damaged windows. I'm not religious but it's a very fucked up scene. I'm pissed at this guy but I began looking around inside the church and the area outside for the gun. I stop and I realize where the perp put the gun.\n\nI look behind the tree and see the semi-automatic gun, and for our future officers, don't touch the fucking gun! I yell at my Lieutenant, \"I got it over LT!\" I look back and realize in my horror what could have happened. The perp had excellent cover and if had started shooting I was in the wide fucking open with no cover, none other than retreating to my vehicle which would have been 10 to 15 yards away, meanwhile the perp would have had a 100 year old oak tree as basic cover. I'm a good shot but any good cop knows, cover is best. My LT congratulates me on my first gun arrest and residence burglary arrest. I look over and see my buddy from earlier in the day arriving on scene and asking what I got, I tell him and we start talking as I stand over the gun waiting on crime lab. Another officer shows up and the three of us are talking, my buddy says to the other officer, \"Yeah Brownbearks can fucking search a building!\" The other officer looks at me and laughs, and I say, \"I got your six buddy.\" He looks at me laughs and says, \"I'll pretend you didn't say that, this aint a video game.\" ",

        "text": "It was a beautiful sunny morning and I had finally gotten time to get some coffee after cleaning up our back log of domestics calls, vehicle accidents, and residence burglary alarms. My partner is an older and experienced cop from Mississippi with a big southern draw and a penchant for getting into some heavy stuff.  \n\nI was finally at my coffee location and talking with my just new retired Sergeant. He had been on the job for 34 plus years and was finally enjoying a coffee in the sun and not dealing with new policies or the bull shit of the job. I was enjoying my iced coffee and my partner was talking to the other retired officers at the table about the good old days when cops were able to be cops. I'm just fresh on the job and taking it all in and my newly retired Sergeant says, \"Don't worry about your partner he just misses cracking skulls, but there is still a lot of fun things out there for the young guys like you.\" I thank my Sergeant and start to return to my car and see if we have any calls for service holding, but I'm almost positive we have nothing happening in our district, a first time for me.   \n        \nMy partner yells, \"STOP, I SAID STOP! BROWNBEARKS!\" I turn back and before my eyes I see the most simple crime in my life. A young black male is running with two white purses and another man, later identified as the store loss prevention associate is running behind the thief, he yells to my partner, \"STOP THAT KID, HE JUST STOLE THOSE PURSES!\" My partner has some age and it shows when he turns to the face young thief running down the sidewalk and puts his hands in the air to stop him and shouts, \"STOP!\" The thief jukes my partner and turns down a large alley way designed for tractor trailers to deliver their payload in the rear. My partner turns the corner and I am about 10 yards behind him and start getting my ass into gear to catch up to my partner and the thief. I catch up to my partner very quickly and see the thief is about another 20 yards away, he's very fast and doesn't have a gun belt, a vest, and heavy boots. My adrenaline pulses through my body and I eat the ground up between myself and the thief. The thief turns around and sees me, he throws the purses over a fence adjacent to the the property and attempts to climb over the fence. I catch up to him and grab his legs. He screams out, \"Let me go man! Let me go!.\" I start commanding him to drop back over. My partner catches up to me and so do the retired cops, my partner are yelling command at the thief to return to our side of the fence. The young thief refuses to let go and one of the retired cops ask for our taser, to achieve compliance. My partner and I yell in unison, \"NO!\" Neither of us want to even touch the paperwork that comes with the taser and let alone deal with the Internal Affairs about the wrong use of our tasers, we aren't allowed to use tasers for compliance anymore, the retired cop helps pull the thief's arms back and I handcuff the perpetrator. \n\nThe loss prevention associate is very relieved and thankful and retrieves the purses. My adrenaline is fading and I'm realizing how much paperwork I am about to do for a very simple theft case, but I have an apprehension and I look really good for the department. The loss prevention associate gives me a receipt and a video of the thief snatching two purses off a display and running out of the store. An open and shut case. \n\nMy lieutenant and current sergeant watch my body worn camera and my partners back at our station while I complete my paperwork. My lieutenant walks into the back of the station where we have the perpetrator locked into a cell and the computers to finish my paperwork to get him into lock-up. She says, \"I just watched your partners body worn camera, you smoked him like a cheap cigar! Great apprehension!\" I say thanks and look at my partner and he has a grin on his face, the kind of grin that says you will pay for that later. I finish my report and take the thief to lock-up, the perp asks, \"What am I being arrested for?\" My partner just says, \" what do you think for?\"  and the perp responds with, \"I don't know,\" my partner just looks at the guy and shakes his head while I laugh.

        "text": "This happened around 10 years ago or so. My college buddies and I were out for a stroll in a small town on the east coast of the US with a Historic Main Street. Now, this historic district was old by US standards, and so the streets were very narrow. \n\nMain Street was narrow and 2-lanes leading up a pretty steep hill lined with antique shops and little cafes. We had just come out of one of the cafes when we saw a guy stumble, fall, and bust his head open on the sidewalk right in front of us. Friend #1 called 911, while the rest of us stood around rather shell-shocked.\n\nThe fire department came pretty quickly. First to arrive was the hook and ladder truck, which effectively closed down Main-street, as there was only around a half-car's width of space between it and the parked car on the other side. This was followed up quickly thereafter by the ambulance. So at this point, there are around 5 or so volunteer firefighters and EMT's milling about the scene, all with radios on their hips.\n\nNow traffic was pretty well blocked behind the incident. The young lady who was first amidst the line of cars backing up behind the emergency response vehicles, however, assessed the situation and decided that she could squeeze between the fire engine and the parked cars and continue on her merry way. Unfortunately, for her she chose poorly. \n\nWe all heard the crunch and scrape of metal on metal as the side of her car dragged along side the firetruck. Everyone watched in amazement as, instead of stopping, she ran the stop sign at the intersection beyond the incident and kept going, leaving a bright blue stripe of paint along the side of the firetruck and a bit of her bumper behind.\n\n\"I can't believe she just did that!\" I exclaimed to the firefighters who were laughing and shaking their heads. \"Every single one of us has a radio,\" one of them replied, unclipping his from his belt and radioing dispatch.  Needless to say, the State Trooper caught up with her a couple of blocks later, and she had a bit of explaining to do.\n\nETA: The guy the ambulance was called for was fine. He fainted and hit his head, but was otherwise uninjured.",

        "text": "Warning: a particular four letter word is used many times in this story.\n\nIn my state, a red light behind you means pull to the right. I think that's universal in all states, actually. That said, many people seem to throw that out the window on the freeway. This was one of those times.\n\nI was heading northbound in I-50, in the fast lane (#1), doing about 75 in a 65 zone, looking for speeders. My minimum is 80 mph for someone to earn a ticket.\n\nI watched a white Camry merge onto the freeway ahead. They made a sudden lane change around a car from the slow lane, to their left, over-correcting, and nearly hitting a car two lanes over. That's a good reason to make a stop. Then they punched the accelerator, and I wanted to see how much more evidence I could build up against them. So I waited a moment as they built up speed, went into the fast lane, got stuck behind a slower car, swerved around them, and then picked up speed again. Three moving violations in 5 seconds.\n\nI pulled in behind and turned on my rear lights so traffic behind me got a warning that something was up. Then I turned on my red lights. The Camry immediately put on their turn signal to the right and knew they were caught. I followed them from the fast lane to the #2 lane, at which point they slammed on their brakes. Not normal. They then hit their left turn signal and swerved back into the fast lane. Also not normal. I followed them as they did this, and grabbed my microphone. Stolen car? Felony warrant?\n\nSo we're now back in the fast lane and braking hard. The Camry brakes even harder, and I go over the microphone, \"Keep going, keep going.\" I think she probably engaged ABS at this point, as we're doing 20 mph in moderate traffic in the fast lane and I swerve to avoid plowing into the back of her while, now yelling, \"KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!!!\"\n\nAt this point I'm mumbling, \"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, you're going to get me killed.\" So I pulled all the way to the right shoulder, out of the lanes, hoping she'll get the idea. She does.\n\nI walk up to make contact, and my microphone is picking up, \"Jesus christ what the fucking fuck you fucking moron...\n\nGood morning, ma'am! The reason I stopped you was for your speed. What were you, uh, trying to do there as you were stopping in the fast lane?\"\n\n\"I was trying to pull into the center divide, but then I realized there wasn't one so...yeah.\" She later told me she was on her way to work, was running late, and was a nurse. And I did not care in the least bit. She earned a ticket.\n\nSo, if you ever see a cop speeding through traffic with no lights on, it's not just because we can. It's often so people don't lose their minds when they see red lights behind them.",

        "text": "This is the moment that's scared me the most in my short career.\n\nI was going to break, it wasn't the latest break but I was ready.  It was probably about 1:30 it was a mess of movement while everyone was rushing to get shit done before it was time to start up chow for medium custody where we would also be starting DOTs.\n\nI'd taken off my vest because I didn't want to wear it outside and then have to bring it back in through shakedown.  This was and still is normal practice.\n\nSo I'm standing around bullshitting for half a second when I hear it over the radio.  And I don't hear much of anything to be honest just a female saying something all panicky about our level 3 wing.  These are our staff assaultive inmates.\n\nSo we take off running and slide onto the wing where I see maybe 4 or 5 officers kind of doing a semi-circle thing.  We run up, my sgt has just sprayed the inmate and can't breathe so I take his spot and then I see it.\n\nThe inmates not cuffed.  The cuffs are attatched to one wrist, but I don't see that because in his right hand is a shank.  I'm not good at lengths and all that, I think later they said it was 9 inches.  What I saw was about one of his hands and a half that he wasn't holding.  He's in his white shirt and shorts, and they're orange.\n\nAnd he's waving it around.  We're all yelling at him to drop it and get to the ground.  I'm standing just a little behind Ofc. Gab so I don't see the resident dinosaur pull her gas and I don't hear her telling him she'll spray him again.  But apparently this is what gets him to throw the shank and get to his knees.\n\nI rush in, and push him flat while Gab is yelling it's okay he's not resisting.  Hands behind his back, huh already has one on.  Fuck it, put the other half on and double lock.\n\nI don't remember what happened after that because this was a minute ago, but I remember that damned shank in his hand clear as day.\n\nTurned out to be a cluster fuck of complacency that lead to the inmate getting out of that cell without his handcuffs all the way on and he'd chased the boss on that wing with the shank in an attempt to take him hostage.",

        "text": "I got a pre-law degree and had to do an internship, so I decided to do one at a local PD since it was a lot more interesting than interning for a public defender, an ADA, or a firm. The sergeant in charge of internships was really good and made sure we had a knowledgeable and entertaining internship (I had friends who interned for the state troopers and got stuck mowing the barrack's lawn every week!). My internship required 40 hrs a week so I did three ride alongs and then ten hours of office work each week. Throughout the course of my 4 month internship I logged about 500 hours of ride alongs, and each one is documented in a five to ten page paper (internship requirement). I figured I'd share some of the more entertaining anecdotes from my time. \n\nI was given the nickname \"Tase\" after the second week of my internship because in every ride along I went on until that point, and essentially every ride along after, someone was tasered by the officer I was shadowing. This story is from my second ridealong with the PD.\n\nWe had just been at a McDonald's parking lot helping a lady who had called in that some kids had slashed her tires. Turns out she'd been riding on balled tires for some time and had literally worn her from right tire to the point that all that was left was the metal mesh. She wasn't having any of it and the officer was getting pretty annoyed with her. That's when he got a call for backup in what should have been a routine traffic stop following a hit and run in a grocery parking lot.\n\nWe excused ourselves from the situation with the lady and got in the car to meet the officer who was now chasing the hit and run suspect. I was pretty excited because this was the first time I'd been in the car with the lights and sirens on for a legitimate reason and not just showing off in a parking lot.\n\nWhile we were coming to meet up with them the suspect had been driving up and down back roads and alleys off of main street (a four lane road with a suicide lane). We got onto main and the officer radioed that he was behind the suspect three roads down from us off of main. Another office pulled in front of us, roughly 700 feet ahead, off a street that merges with main and both he and us turned down the next street, which runs parallel to where the suspect was last seen.\n\nBy the time we got onto the street the officer in front of us had gotten out of his car and was standing by his door. The suspect was coming towards the street we were on. The suspect turned onto the street and we proceeded to drive towards him in our lane, we were doing about 50 mph (I omitted this from my write-up as I also gave a copy to the sergeant and I did not wish to get the officer I was with in trouble). The suspect veered into our lane and started coming directly at us. At about 15 feet away the officer driver the car I was in swerved to the left, entered the opposite lane, proceeded to swing the read end around 180 degrees, slide up onto the side walk and began driving the opposite way we had been going before.\n\nMeanwhile the suspect continued in the wrong lane, towards the officer who had gotten out of his car. This officer took the driver's action as a threat, as he continued to accelerate towards the officer. The officer drew his pistol and fired four shots into the car. The suspect swerved onto the opposite sidewalk from us, got sideways, and slide through three small trees, four garbage cans, and came to a stop after hitting a much larger tree to the driver side. Two suspects got out of the rear passenger door. A third suspect fell from the front passenger door. \n\nThe driver proceeded to drive forward, across the street, over the sidewalk and crashed through a steel fence around a office's parking garage. He fled from the car at this point, into the parking lot. \n\nWe came up to his car at about the same time that four other officers arrived. They all entered into the parking lot first and I followed afterwards, staying behind the officer I was shadowing and behind the \"perimeter\" they were slowly clearing. \n\nThe officer I was shadowing found the suspect hiding under an SUV. The suspect moved for his pocket and the officer tased him in the left shoulder. The suspect's head proceeded to rapidly shake up and down, alternating between hitting the underside of the car and the asphalt. \n\nHe was subsequently arrested, along with the three others. Turns out the car was stolen, he was carrying 4 pounds of various drugs, a stolen pistol, and a dozen porno magazines that we later found out they stole from a gas station after a failed attempt to rob it earlier that day.",

        "text": "I went on a Ridealong with a good family friend who works in the K9 division, we'll call him (J). The day started at 6:30AM with a burglary in progress! We arrived on scene and J walks in with his k9 and another officer. They discover signs of burglary such as a door kicked in, and items scattered along the floor. The officers searched the building and found no suspects. I was allowed to enter the building after everything was code 4. The other officer there took the report so we were on our way. So I thought oh boy, it's going to be a busy day. I was mistaken for quite a while. The rest of the day was calm until it stopped raining heavily. We were out and about for a couple hours doing regular patrol, searching common \"hotspots\" and looking for stolen vehicles etc. Then our day got really interesting. We got dispatched to a couple of calls requesting k9 but another agency was closer so they took the call, or they ended up not needing us. Our day took a turn near the end of our shift.\n\nDispatch- \"K15.\" \nJ- \"K15 go ahead\"\nDispatch- \"CHP is requesting K9 assistance for a 10851 suspect who bailed on foot.\" (10851 is a stolen vehicle)\nJ- \"10-4\"\nDispatch- \"Suspect is a white male, red hat, long hair\"\nJ- \"10-4\"\nAt this point in time we went code 3 (lights and sirens). So we're driving to the scene which is about 10-15 minutes away due to the weather and traffic. We also got the typical drivers who aren't paying attention and won't get out of the way because they aren't paying attention, etc so it took a little longer than expected. \n\nWe arrive on scene and as soon as we get there J and his K9 went searching for the suspect. It stopped raining at this point but it's muddy and we're in the middle of nowhere. CHP sets up a perimeter and some of our deputies start showing up to help search. I'm not allowed to go with him on searches because it's a liability but I'm listening intently on the radio and chatting with a witness who was actually a huge help to the search. He called a bunch of his neighbors to make sure they were home so they could let all of the officers into their yards to search and as well as have as many eyes looking for this guy. He was a really nice individual and very pro law enforcement which was nice for a change with all of the hate towards you guys lately. \n\nDispatch asks for J's status and he says he's looking but it could take a while because the yards are huge. It's in the country so many houses have acres of land. J and his K9 are searching for a good 20-30 minutes and didn't find the suspect but he did find boot prints leading into a backyard.\n\nThey come back to the unit and J said we're going to go around to the other side to see if we can find anything. We drive around to the other side and they start searching again. They didn't find any footprints leading out of the property so they decided to check that property more thoroughly. We drive to the front of the house and the CHP officer knocks on the door and gets permission from the homeowner to search the property. They're granted permission and begin searching. I'm sitting in the unit listening to the radio traffic. J and the CHP officer are searching the backyard and they discover the suspect's red hat propped up against a tree. They're searching more and more and notice there aren't any footprints leading outside of the residence so he's in there somewhere it's just locating him from that point. \n\nHere's where it gets interesting, J comes up on the air and says \"K9 deployed\" I though oh man, here we go! So J told me what happened and here's the summary. The CHP officer and J were getting frustrated. They searched the whole yard and made plenty of announcements. J thought to himself, this dude is probably sitting in this hay bale over here. J got on top of the hay bale. He looked down and saw what appeared to be hair. The CHP officer removed some of the hay and sure enough there was the suspect. J deployed his K9 because there were no signs of his hands when they first uncovered him and they had no idea if he was armed or not. The suspect was extremely compliant and didn't scream at all after he was bit. He was wearing a Carhartt jacket that basically saved his arm from being torn up. He'll feel that bite tomorrow!  J has the largest K9 at our department. \n\nThey arrest the suspect for various charges. They run him through records and sure enough, he has 3 felony warrants. It was a good arrest! The Sergeant shows up because J deployed his K9 and there is a use of force form that he had to fill out. CHP does their thing and all we had to do now was wait for medics to clear the arrestee. Medics take awhile to arrive because it started pouring rain after they completed their arrest. \n\nMedics finally arrived and ultimately cleared him but we still had to go to the county hospital. We arrive at the hospital and of course had to wait for a while. We also had to complete an investigation with questions such as, \"Why were you hiding?\" \"Why did you run?\" \"Where did the dog bite you?\" We had technical services come take photos of the bite and then we were on our way. CHP handled everything from there. \n\nIt was a great experience, I learned quite a lot, and I got to see some interesting things. J told me that if you have an instinct follow it! J never gave up and he knew he was in there somewhere. If you feel like all is lost, don't give up! \n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "Yep, it finally happened. I'm on the other end of one of these stories!\n\nI'm a pretty avid cyclist, and at the moment I'm also training for a road race in Colorado this summer. The one advantage of moving to my current town about six months ago is the actual bike infrastructure. Dedicated bike lanes, trails, friendly drivers, it's night and day compared to where I used to live.\n\nTo be 100% honest I'm not very fast. My bike isn't the lightest thing on the road (aluminum instead of carbon) and I'm no Chris Froome. But I can still keep the cranks turning and hold a respectable speed. On days I'm practicing getting into aerodynamic positions and really hauling ass, there's a wonderful stretch of road on the west side of town that's about two miles long, with no stoplights, and smoooooth asphalt. \n\nThere also happens to be a school right at the end of said road. \n\nDecided to not be a lazy POS and get out for an early morning ride about two weeks ago. The sun had just come up when I set out and decided I wanted to test out the new tires I had put on, so a speed run it was. After about half an hour of getting a feeling for the new tread I made a left and started getting up to speed, kicking it into high gear and just slamming those pedals. \n\nI've got a little electronic speedometer on my bike, but I was never too confident in the accuracy of the thing and always thought it measured a little fast. 15mph...18...20...23...26...\n\nI was just starting to pass the school and put on my brakes for the upcoming stopsign. Aaaaaand that's when I hear that wonderful \"whoop whoop!\" and see red and blues flashing. My initial reaction was \"oh shit a cop, guess he's heading to a call, better get out of the way.\" So I pull off to the side of the road to let him pass.\n\nNope. \n\nI reach down to get my water bottle. Next thing I know, there's an officer getting out of his car behind me, walking up with the biggest shit-eating grin I've ever seen. And just like any other traffic stop, we go through the routine.\n\nHim: \"Sir, do you know why I stopped you?\"\n\nMe: \"I know you hear this all the time, but...honestly officer, I have no idea.\"\n\nHim: \"Technically, you entered a school zone about a block back that way. That means it's a 20 mile an hour zone.\"\n\nMe: \"Wait, I was over 20?\"\n\nHim: \"Yup, I clocked you doing 25. Do you have any ID on you?\"\n\nI hand him my ID and stand there, in full lycra and racing jersey, chugging water like it's the first drink I've had in years, while he goes back and runs my info. \n\nHim: \"Okay, you don't have any warrants or anything, so I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Besides, I don't really know the procedure for ticketing someone on a bicycle anyway.\"\n\nMe: \"Thank you sir. So...I was really doing 25? I guess this little computer is more accurate than I thought!\"\n\nWe both had a good laugh. Apparently he was the first guy to pull over a cyclist in almost a year and a half. \n\nSo yeah, no more aero practice on that particular road I guess :(",

        "text": "It's been a while! I hope to get back into a routine that will let me post here more often again. Sorry I left you hanging, and also to the guys who prefer me to post stuff to my subreddit early - I'll make it up to you.\n\n_______________________\n\n\nI sighed and reclined the driver’s seat a bit more. Surveillance was my least favorite part of the job – super boring until you actually see what you’re looking for then a mad rush of excitement that sometimes ends with disappointment if you can’t pull your plan together quick enough to move on it. The worst part about this particular endeavor was I knew I had no real plan if I saw my suspect – all my co-workers had either transferred, were on leave, or in training. If I called for help I’d be relying on a roll of the dice and a hope I’d get a motivated response from patrol. With a murder suspect, I thought it made more sense to just take what intel I got and come back to fight another day. \n\nThe sports-talk jock on the radio was pushing the same topic he had been dwelling on for the last two commercial breaks into a third and I decided maybe I’d prefer some music to distract me from the monotony of staring at an un-opening door. Just as I was reaching for the car radio, my computer gave the tone indicating a priority event was incoming. Priority events, by my department’s definition can be anything from a cat biting a veterinarian (“Oh no! Rabies!”) to a shots fired homicide in progress. Usually though, they’re more on the side of the former. I clicked the button to forward the new message onto the screen and was surprised. The event notification was for a burglary in progress. I quickly estimated the chances it was a real event at 80/20 in favor of it being BS but read on. \n\n“Caller states an unknown man is in his house with a gun. Call came in through a number returning as a Skype call.” The dispatcher was reading along with me as she dispatched two patrol units in the vicinity. \n\n“Swat call.” I thought to myself. They had been on the rise of late and this sounded like a classic example. Just scary enough to get a priority response, just vague enough to keep us guessing once we did arrive. I settled back into my seat and sighed again after scanning the empty courtyard in front of me once more. \n\nA minute or two later the radio came screaming to life. “SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!” One of the guys who had just arrived at the call I assumed to be a false alarm quickly ruled out my deduction. “WHITE MALE IN A BLACK JACKET! TWO ROUNDS… I’M NOT HIT.”\n\nI was already peeling out of my parking spot (no lights and sirens yet – didn’t want to tip off my murder suspect after all) and heading his way. Traffic was heavy so it took me twice as long to get to the scene as it should have even after I turned on all my loud and flashy equipment. I pulled up to a patrol officer on the exterior perimeter and started suiting up. “Anything new?” I asked him as I was buckling my ballistic helmet and checking the Aim Point sight on my rifle. \n\n“No. We’re just shutting down foot and vehicle traffic so no one gets in the crossfire.” He reported back. \n\nOne of the supervisors who had made it through to the interior perimeter came across the radio requesting a shield respond to his location to provide extra cover for a reaction team. I grabbed mine from my trunk and threw it in the passenger compartment before voicing up on the radio that I was en route with one. \n\nI pulled up to a strange scene – two cruisers with their driver’s door open parked in the middle of the street, still running but with no one around. I scanned the yards and parked cars for anyone hunkered down in positions of cover but didn’t see anyone. “Strange.” I thought to myself. I jumped out of my car, walked around to get my rifle out of the back seat and slung up, and as I was pulling the shield from the foot well, heard a hiss from behind me. It was Zach – the cop who had been shot at. \n\n“That’s the house!” He hissed, pointing over my head to a squat brick rambler right in front of me. \n\n“That is?” I looked to the house as if that would confirm his accusation. “But the event said it was across the street?” As in, down the road and out of my line of sight. \n\n“No, man. It’s that one right there!” \n\nI dropped the shied and ran to the cover position Zach had been hiding in, leaving my running cruiser parked in the road and running with the other two. “Jesus! I thought-”\n\n“I know,” A sergeant I didn’t recognize peeked from around the back of the garage we were huddled beside. “I did the same thing. The black unmarked is mine.”\n\n“Well, crap. A lot of good that shield is doing us propped against my car.” I huffed, contemplating my next move and if it was worth it to enter the line of fire to retrieve it. \n\n“Oh well.” Zach replied, leveling his rifle at the house. “All I know is if this crazy bastard comes out pointing a gun at me again I’m not letting him get a second chance at blowing me away.”\n\n“Are you sure there’s no one else in the house?” The sergeant was asking a short, fat man behind the garage. He noticed my look of confusion and informed me, “Oh, this is the guy’s dad. His son has been a little riled up the last couple days and he pulled up to see what all the fuss was about right after I got here.”\n\n“No, no. No one else. My wife and younger son are at work and school. There’s no one else inside.” \n\nAs if on cue, the dispatcher came across the radio. “All units: call taker is back on with the subject. He is stating that he has hostages and will shoot any police he sees outside his home.”\n\n“There’s no one!” The dad yelled at the sergeant’s radio in reply. “He doesn’t even own any guns. Watch – I’ll just walk over there and prove to you-”\n\n“Sir, do not leave the side of this garage. I don’t want anyone else getting shot at.” The sergeant grabbed the man’s shoulder, preventing him from moving forward any more.\n\n“Yeah, one of us is plenty today, trust me.” Zach said.\n\n“He’s just crazy is all.” The dad told us. “He has a couple BB guns, nothing more.”\n\n“BB Gun?” I asked Zach as I got into a comfortable prone position nearby, rifle pointed at the house. \n\n“Trust me; that was no BB gun.” He muttered. \n\nHours passed, my back cramped, the cold ground slowly sapped the life from me. SWAT was assembled and in the process of relieving all interior perimeter units from their positions when the dispatcher came across the radio again. “All units on the shots fired call: subject just disconnected after saying he was coming out. He said he is still armed and will not put down his weapons.”\n\nI braced myself and settled into my gun. I was about fifty yards from the front door and the lighting conditions had deteriorated since I had first set up but the little red dot in my Aim Point still fit neatly inside one of the small windows on the storm door. Through it, I saw the door open, then a man exit holding an assault rifle slung across his chest and pointed down. I flicked off my safety. Commands of “Drop the gun!” joined my own from, seemingly from every direction.\n\nThe man twirled in confusion, right hand on the rifle’s grip, left depressing the muzzle, looking for an obvious source of the commands. “SHOOT ME!” He yelled at us, desperation thick in his voice. “SHOOT ME IN THE HEAD!” He was still glancing about frantically. My red dot followed him as he paced back and forth. \n\n“DROP THE RIFLE!” I yelled at him again. He spun but his gaze missed my position. The rifle was still pointed down. \n\n“Do what they tell you! Don’t make them hurt you, Sam!” The father yelled from behind me, anger and urgency obvious in his plea. \n\n“Dad?” The man yelled in our direction.\n\n“Put it DOWN!” The father yelled back. \n\nMy red dot was steady on his chest, not even bobbing as I breathed heavy from the stress. It stayed firmly in the middle of his chest as the man slowly reached his left hand up, grabbed the sling from his shoulder, and pulled it over his head. He dropped the gun in front of him. \n\n“GUN, GUN IN HIS WAIST BAND!” Someone yelled over the radio. \n\nSam must’ve heard and he pulled a silver revolver from his pants. “SHOOT ME! C’MON, DO IT YOU PUSSIES!” He held the gun at arm’s length, pointed up into the air at a forty-five degree angle in his right hand, his left positioned the same way but empty, palm upturned in an almost pleading manner. \n\n“NO SAM!” The father wailed frantically. \n\n“DROP IT!” the command came in rolling cascades from all around, different voices but all with the same deadly urgency. \n\nI could see the whole of Sam’s torso and arms through my scope. He looked, I thought, like the Vitruvian Man a bit with his arms raised in that fashion. I thought of Vitruvian Man again when I set the parameter his arm would have to drop in order for me to feel justified in taking his life to preserve someone else’s. If he dropped it parallel with the ground he’d be pointing it in the direction of the reaction team, of other houses and a busy road, of a school with who knows how many people inside. My finger tensed on the trigger. Sam paced a bit in a grand and morbid show of contempt. A K9 began barking from his cover point a house away, probably prompted by his handler to add another psychological incentive to comply with our commands and not end this event with bloodshed. Still, my red dot followed Sam around. \n\nHis right hand began to droop a bit. My index finger pulled up the little bit of slack still left in the trigger. “Shoot me.” He cried halfheartedly. \n\nI began wondering who I should call first after I killed this man, then to what the news was going to say about it. “Is this moment going to ruin my life? This decision that is in this man’s hands? Am I in the right here?” I slowed my breathing and focused again on the red dot. \n\nBirds chirping and the droning of our helicopter’s rotors broke the otherwise silent scene. \n\nSam’s forearm tensed. He flung his hand over his head, hurling the silver handgun like a grenade into his yard, then slumped his head and shoulders forward.\n\n“HANDS UP! HANDS!!” one of the SWAT operators yelled, and Sam slowly complied. \n\nHe was compliant as they guided him away from the rifle in the yard, into the street. He turned around like he was told, but refused to go down on his knees. The reaction team began advancing in a straight line behind their lead who was using a shield, his handgun bent around it and aimed at Sam. Sam suddenly turned to them and the “POP!” sound I heard caused my heart to skip a beat.\n\n“Oh God. Did they kill him?” Whimpered the father behind me. \n\nSam, stumbled and they pumped another bean bag round into his chest, then the K9 was on him, tackling him to the ground and pinning him as the take-down team moved in and secured him. \n\nSam was transported to the hospital for treatment from the bite and less lethal rounds as well as a mental health evaluation. Zach swore out several warrants against him and took the next day off. I stuck around and helped on the follow up investigation. \n\nNo one was seriously hurt that day, but I still find myself questioning the whole thing. The IA supervisor who responded spoke to me candidly on the side. “From what everyone is saying, this would have been justified had someone fired.” He punctuated it with a shake of his head before walking away. \n\nWas the head shake a silent condemnation of my inaction? My unwillingness to end a dangerous situation? \n\nDisapproval of Sam’s mental condition? Empathy for his family? \n\nThe current state of the media in how they portray these events? That cops would hesitate to do their jobs for fear of being smeared across website headlines, their academy graduation picture plastered on fancy news studio graphics behind a heavily made-up anchor with a judging, furrowed brow?\n\nI couldn’t decipher it then and will probably never know. Just like I don’t know what will happen the next time Sam decides to take a gun and force someone to make a hard decision based on his actions. \n\nI sat on the homicide suspect’s house the next day. The door never opened. \n",

My mom, older brother and I were shopping at a walmart and I started playing in the middle of clothes racks. I wasn't walking far from my mom, but sooner than later she didn't notice I wasn't next to the basket and walked off. I came out and couldn't find her, but by that time the store was on full lockdown and officers were en route. Yay. Thankfully I'm pretty sure they were called off quickly as I was in fact, perfectly safe.\n\nThe second time was a little more dramatic. The church my parents went to was a mall movie theater converted into a church, and this Sunday was no different than any other- except that after church, I was missing. The entire shopping mall was locked down, and police, responders, and volunteers were searching a giant drainage pit full of water that was next to the mall. This went on for several hours and I'm sure they all expected to only find a body if they got lucky.\n\nSo where was I? Well, I had the only logical reaction to that day's sermon and being woken up early- I was asleep under one of the church seats on top of my favorite blanket, under the very seats my parents sat in if I recall the story correctly.\n\nSo, to all you cops that have to spend valuable time on shit like that, I'm sorry. Hats off to all of you. I hope I've somewhat made it up to you as I've never needed to be pulled over, except for my license plate lights being out!",

And carried along in these RFD winds was hail. Not just any hail, BIG freakin' hail. Needless to say my windshield, my side glass, my mirrors, pretty much anything NOT made of metal was soon destroyed and the body work resembled a golf ball. There was at least enough of the windshield not destroyed for me to sort of see on the way back to the hotel, and I could already feel the pain in my wallet from replacing all the glass in this thing the next day.\n\n\nAbout halfway back to the hotel I see Christmas lights behind me and slowly pull over while mumbling about it being par for the course. The officer strolls up to my window:\n\nO: Sir do you know why I pulled you over?\n\n\nM: I'm guessing because I have no windows, no rear glass, and my vehicle looks like its been in a dryer filled with ball bearings?\n\n\nO: Actually you have a tail light out.\n\n\nM: Ah. I'll add that to tomorrow's grocery list.\n\n\nO: The windshield is a concern though.

        "text": "So, I posted this in an /r/AskReddit thread and someone pointed me in this direction and said some of you would like to hear the story. \n\n\nSo here it goes.\n\nSo I had just picked up 3 of my friends from one of their houses. We left and were on our way to SAran Wrap one of our other friends cars. Not 1 minute after I picked them up we pass a police car. One of my frineds wasn't wearing a seat belt and we saw the police officer turn around and flick his lights on. We thought he saw the frined without his seatbelt on and that was it. \n\nWe pull over and the police officer sits in his car for 2 minutes until another officer pulls up behind him. We thought it was odd but figured he was just running my plates. He approaches my window and asks me If I knew the reason he pulled us over. I say jokingly \"Casue dummy over here wasn't wearing his seatbelt\" and me and my frineds laugh. The cop looks at me with a stern look and says \"Your vehicle matches the desciption of a car that just left the scene of an armed robbery.\" We didn t know how to react so we just looked at him and had that nervous laughter not knowing if he was just pulling our leg or not.\n\nHe took all of us out of the car and sat us on the ground. Ten minutes go by and there are about 6 police cars there now and 9 or so cops. People are starting to come out of their houses and its starting to become a scene. They line us up and tell us that the cruiser 50 yards away has the victim in the front seat and she is going to see if we were the ones who robbed her. We had nothign to worry about, we didnt do anything so we were about to be let go. Not what happened. \n\nONe of the Officers behind us points at two of my buddies and then cuffs both of them up and puts them in the back of a cruiser. My other friend and I dont know what to think. We start talking to one of the officers and he tels us everythign that happened. That there was a knife involved and that the women was slapped and a ton of info. They put us in the back of one of the cruisers together and leave us alone. We talk about what the officer told us and didnt think abything of it. \n\nThey bring us to the station and sit us at a table and tell us not to talk to one another. The lead officer on the case was our Baseball coach, So I guess he was one of the main invesitgators not arresting officer. They asked us Questions and all of our stories lined up perfectly. After 7 hours of sitting at the police station they finally let us go and tell us that they believed us and that since our stories were all exactly the same it couldn't have been us who did it. \n\nThis changed the way the cities police Department handled cases like this. Up until this point, if they had an eye witness who positivly ID'd a suspect, they would book the person and that would be it. But since My baseball coach was there, he pleaded for the chief to handle it differently that day. \n\nTurns out, the officer who told us all the info of what happened got in trouble becasue we were not suppose to know that stuff. So me and my buddy talking about it in the back of the cop car almost got us thrown in Juvi for the weekend.\n\nThe way we were treated at the station by officers not involved with the case was what hurt me the most. People walking by and asking if we were the thieves and stuff like that. 17 year old me was embarassed by the whole thing during the whole ordeal. But it was an awesome story to tell afterwards.\n\nI probobly left some details out since Im horrible at telling stories. if you have any questions or anythign just ask away. I will be happy to answer.\n",

        "text": "*State Trooper. All radio traffic and jargon translated into normal english.*\n\nIt's 6am in the morning and everyone just got out of briefing, so we're all starting up our cars. It's a good 15 minute process due to radios, computers, flares, and whatever mystery the officer before us left for us to find. I'm Unit 1 for the day, so I work Unit 1's beat. We go down to 8 units with 8 beats (this is important).\n\nSomething I was taught was that the first thing you do is head out and drive your entire beat. Not possible in some areas, but my office was small enough so everyone could do that. You'd find abandoned stolen cars, people broken down, or crashes no one had reported. I've found a lot of other officers don't do this.\n\nOur computer system allows us to check on pending calls and assign them to ourselves before dispatch even does. Once my computer is booted up, I see that there's a crash with no details on Unit 8's beat. \"Dispatch, this is Unit 1, I'll be en route to the crash on Unit 8's beat.\" I do this so I can help the people in the crash, and help out the other unit while he's still starting his car.\n\nThe details we had was a Corvette that was weaving in the lanes, looked like a drunk driver, and then crashed into the concrete wall on the right side of the road. There was no shoulder, so the car was stopped in the slow lane. To make it more exciting, it was around a mostly blind curve.\n\nI rolled up on scene to find a 6'5\" male out of the vehicle, leaning against the wall, and on his cell phone for roadside assistance. He tells me he's not injured. I asked what happened, and he said he was cut off, swerved to avoid, and over-corrected. Plausible...except that this car was called in as possibly driving drunk, the freeway was basically empty, and I can smell the booze on this guy as he's talking to me. I looked at his car and see basically all the airbags inside were deployed, and the right side tires are sheered off. It's not going anywhere on its own power, so I start a tow truck. I try to get more details from the driver, when he lets me know he was dropping his friend of at his house in a nearby town.\n\nI then have a brief moment of realization: he just said he was dropping someone off. I ask him, \"Is your passenger okay?\" And I walk up to the car to check on the previously forgotten friend. \"Oh shit, man, I don't even know.\" I pull open the door and get a flood of alcohol and vomit smell. Good news: driver was the least drunk of the two. Bad news: passenger is so drunk he can't respond more than mumbles. \"Unit 1, start me an ambulance. Also, I need a second unit on expedite (NOW) to slow traffic down. We're in a bad spot.\" Dispatch echos, \"Unit 1 requesting an ambulance, and is there a second unit available to slow down traffic?\" Unit 4 goes en route to help.\n\nI direct the driver to wait where he is while I run back and set flares up. While I'm doing this I ask for a 3rd unit, one with a breath test machine. Unit 3 goes en route.\n\nRemember how this was Unit 8's beat? Crickets from him. I should also mention it was his second day on his own.\n\nLittle did I know, back at the office, Unit 4 goes over to Unit 8, inside, working on paperwork. \"Hey dude, you know there's a crash on your beat?\" He had no idea. Ten minutes later, Unit 8 goes en route.\n\nDuring that 10 minutes, I spoke to the driver, got all of his information, got his passenger's information, fire truck showed up, tow truck showed up, got a statement about what happened, and was just waiting on the ambulance. I spoke to one of the fire fighters on scene, who normally stays on city streets. She commented, \"You know, 70mph feels a lot faster then they're going by 6 inches away from you.\"\n\nUnit 8 showed up. \"I'm so sorry man, I didn't hear it.\" I let him know, \"I don't care, you're here now. I got everything you need and I'm clearing the car and the passenger. All you need to do is test the driver to see if he's drunk.\"\n\nHe does that while I supervise the ambulance personnel loading up the passenger and the tow truck driver loading up the car. I watched as Unit 8 put handcuffs on the driver. He blew 0.17, more than double the legal limit.\n\nThe ambulance cleared the scene, and the firefighters headed out. That same one from earlier called out to me, \"Hey, thanks for keeping us safe!\" \n\nUnit 8 took the driver to jail while I finished cleaning up. He came to me in the office later and was extremely apologetic, and appreciative that I helped out. I didn't lay into him or give him a lecture because he knew he screwed up. I told him we all mess up, and he just needed to keep working on it.\n\nNext week, Unit 8 did the exact same thing.",

        "text": "So my last apartment was in a crappy area. It was alright when I moved in, but it spiraled down the drain during the five years I lived there, and the final year was just terrible. A gang problem developed and two rivals gangs would take turns tagging the sign for the complex, and some cars got tagged. Then there was a murder in one building and a shooting in the parking lot that woke my girlfriend up (I was at work.) \n\nWe ended up getting a \"community police officer\" assigned to our area, and while she was really nice and all that jazz, I'm pretty sure it's not a good thing when that happens. There was a dramatic increase in police activity. It wasn't uncommon for their to be 1-3 squad cars in the lot at any given time. For a period of time, it seemed like there was at least one major bust a week where there would be 10 cop cars all over the complex.\n\nSo it was maybe 4 or 5 months before we moved out and the complex was sold to a new company. They set about trying to clean the place up, and police activity increased further.\n\nOne afternoon my girlfriend and I were hanging out in the living room, playing video games and chilling out. Our roommates who we didn't really care for weren't home, so we were having a good day. My girlfriend was expecting a package, so when we heard a knock at the door, we assumed that was him and that some neighborhood kid had propped the door open or something.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when instead of the UPS man there were three police officers with a K-9 at my door. They informed me that the dog had indicated at our door. \n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I will confess that do smoke from time to time, though weed makes me really dumb and useless. You know those people who say they function better after smoking? I'm not one of those. So I don't smoke unless I wasn't planning on doing anything other than staring slack jawed at a TV for hours anyway.\n\nMy girlfriend would smoke more often than I, but wasn't smoking at the time, and hadn't at all recently. One of my roommates smoked all day everyday, but in her room with the door closed. \n\nSo when the police told me that the dog had indicated at our apartment, and I hadn't heard them talking to our loud neighbors who always stunk up the hallway with their weed, I was a little surprised.\n\nThey told us that it was clear that we were no drug kingpins, which I found insulting. They told us that it was the so-called kingpins who were their target. Honesty is the best policy and all that, so my girlfriend and I told them the truth. If their was any weed in the apartment, it belonged to my roommate, and was in her room and she wasn't home.\n\nThat seemed good enough for them, and they clarified some of the laws for me. I'd been under the impression (because I heard it from a dozen people) that weed was decriminalized in the city as long as it's under a certain amount and in your house, where really it's just a ticket if it's under a certain amount.\n\nThey carried on and I found myself wondering, did the dog really hit on our apartment? Or were they just knocking on everyone's doors telling them the dog indicated to see what they could kick up?",

The supervisor called another officer and me to provide backup. The supervisor was already on his way to take care of some urgent bodily functions when he found the drunk driver so he left the driver in our hands. The driver was so drunk that we called for medical response instead of just carting him of to jail, just to make sure he would survive the night. While we were waiting on EMS, we placed the driver in the back of the police car with handcuffs behind his back. Well, if inebriation is known for one side-effect, it's the induction of vomiting.\n\nHalf-digested corn chowder and beer went all over the back of my car. Pools of it. Under the passenger seat, all over the back bench. Everywere.\n\nThe driver vomited so much that he sounded like he was choking. I rolled down the window to check on him and that's when I found out just how much he had vomited.\n\nEven though the other officer and I checked to make sure that the driver's cuffs were tight enough that he shouldn't have been able to get them off but not tight enough to injure, he used the copious amounts of vomit to lubricate his wrists right out of those cuffs. Clearly he wanted his freedom.\n\nIn fact, he wanted his freedom so bad that, even though he was a fairly sizable fella, he still managed to push his way out of the window, even with both of us trying to keep him in.\n\nHe get completely out of the car but his lack of coordination worked against him and we were able to pull him to the ground. There I was, in the middle of the main road, wrestling with a vomit-lubricated angry drunk and I thought to myself, \"Well, this is about as bad as it can get.\"\n\nWe, of course, frantically called for the supervisor to return to the scene to help us out; he returned and held a flashlight to illuminate us as we continued to wrestle with the driver (thanks for the assist).\n\nWe eventually got him back in to cuffs (and put them tighter than we like to) and back in to a car. When the medics arrived, the driver behaved momentarily. I tried to warn the medics to keep the driver cuffed to a stretcher but I wasn't able to.\n\nI got back to the office and cleaned up to the best of my ability. My supervisor then told the other officer and me that we had to clean out the back of the patrol car. Orders are orders so we did out absolute best with a hose, a shopvac, a box full of nitrile gloves, and multiple medical grade (carcinogenic) wipes. The smell just wouldn't come out.\n\nThroughout the rest of the night, we got several calls to assist the hospital with a combative patient (our driver).\n\nWhen the car still smelled like vomit the next night and the supervisor still wouldn't let me drive a different car, I couldn't do much. When the other shift put the car out of service for the vomit smell and I still had to drive the vomit-smelling car after my days off, I went up the chain of command. Two deep professional detailing jobs later, the car finally smelled better. Needless to say, the other officer and I put in to switch shifts.",

        "text": "*State Trooper. Everything translated into normal English.*\n\nI was parked on a freeway shoulder, near a major city, during rush hour. Everyone's favorite time to be on the road. I was looking for what I call \"cheater\" violations; people cutting over from an open exit lane, back onto the gridlocked freeway, cutting people off and generally making everyone else angry at them.\n\nI spotted a few vehicles a couple hundred feet ahead going from the slow lane, to the shoulder, and back into the slow lane. It looked like they were going around something. I headed up there, expecting a couch or stalled car I'd be clearing out of the way.\n\nI get up there to find a car stopped in the lane with the engine off, and the driver inside. I walk up to him.\n\n\"Good morning, sir. Did it break down on you?\"\n\n\"No, it's fine.\"\n\n\"...do you need me to push your car out of the way?\"\n\n\"No, I'm good, you can go.\"\n\nSomething starts to seem a little off. \"Sir, I can't leave you here. Did you need a tow truck?\"\n\n\"No, I'm good, it's good, see?\" He turns the key into the \"ON\" position, and starts the car up. \"See? It's good. I'm fine. You can go.\"\n\n\"So...it works. So why did you stop?\"\n\n\"I stopped to read my bible. I'm okay, you can go.\" There's no bible in the car. This is when I realize, *Aw hell, you meant to stop here.* I get on the radio, \"Unit 2, out with a disabled vehicle blocking the slow lane, driver may be mentally unstable.\"\n\n\"Okay sir, I'll help you out. Here's what I need you to do. Exit the vehicle for me and walk over to my side.\" The driver gets out and I put him in handcuffs. I then have him take a seat in the back of my car, while I drive his car to the shoulder. Yep, his car worked just fine. I then drove my car, with him in it, to the shoulder, and try to figure out what he was thinking.\n\n\"So you stopped to read your bible?\"\n\n\"Yes sir.\"\n\n\"And you didn't think that was a bad idea on the freeway?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.\" No ID, but he was able to give his name and date of birth. I identified him and found he was licensed to drive big rigs. He also had a business card on him for a local repair shop. My beat partner showed up, and we called the shop. His brother answered and was headed our way to pick up the guy I had. I couldn't get a lot of info out of him, and there was a language barrier.\n\nThe brother showed up and said nothing like this had ever happened. The brother agreed to take him into his custody and get him some help, and we agreed to that so long as the brother did the driving. So Mr. Bible was removed from handcuffs and we headed back to his car. But Mr. Bible wasn't interested in that. \"I'm a truck driver, I always drive, I'll drive from here!\" He started getting irate. He started slamming his hand on the hood and literally thumping his chest. The brother started getting freaked out. So Mr. Bible went back in handcuffs. The brother's explanation was that Mr. Bible was sleep deprived.\n\nNew plan: I drove Mr. Bible back to the shop. The brother drove the car back. I dropped off Mr. Bible to get some sleep. They were all very appreciative that he didn't get sent to a psychiatric facility.\n\nMr. Bible probably didn't appreciate what I did at the office. I issued an emergency driver's license reevaluation. Mr. Bible had his driver's license suspended pending a new driving evaluation. I was just glad his break-down happened in a sedan and not a semi-truck.",

        "text": "Down the hill from me is a very large apartment complex. From a stoplight, a street curves down through the complex. After making a very wide, two-block-long 90-degree turn to the left, assuming you haven't turned into any parking lots, before continuing to more apartments straight ahead, there's also a hard left turn (a T intersection) onto a small, poorly-lit road between the two complexes. The buildings uphill (towards the curved street) are set well back from the side street, with a long grass slope below. My grandparents used to live at the top of this slope. If you're at the top of the slope, there's a path between buildings where you can get back to the main road about 50 feet up from the T intersection.\n\nIf that somewhat complex description makes sense (I really hope it does), one night I was taking a walk, as I often do at night, and going through the complex, I decided to walk past my grandparents' old apartment. There's a playground there, and I sat on a swing, shrouded in a measure of darkness. At the bottom, along the side street, was a large delivery truck, pointing to the right and on my side of the street. After a minute or so, a group of 4 people, one on a skateboard (I think late teens) came walking by, left-to-right towards the T intersection. They stopped just ahead of the truck. One climbed into the driver's side (the door just opened), hopped back out, and they all kept walking. Hum, that's odd. 15 or so feet ahead, they stop, walk back and pile in, and sit inside. That's not at all suspicious. I call the police, just in case. After a few minutes, the truck's engine starts and it slowly pulls away. I'm off the phone, so I trot up the path towards the main street.\n\nI don't see it drive down to the left, so I assume it turned right. I trot up the path to meet the main street and look around. They've parked it just around the corner, piled out, and walked back to look around the corner. Looks like it could be them trying to see if they were spotted. They walk back, climb in, and drive past me up the road. Only a minute later, a police officer pulls up, gets out, confirms that I'm the one who called, and takes my new information. I find it amusing (and tell him so) that there was a nearby supermarket, which just started selling liquor and was having no end of trouble with the locked-in-place, supposed-to-set-off-alarms anti-theft caps, and sitting on the ground next to us was just such a cap, mangled by the assortment of tools that had been used to pry it off. I then continued on my walk.\n\nAbout a half-hour later, walking back, I went up this curved road until it met the stoplight at the top. There, I found the big truck, sitting diagonally in the middle of the intersection, both doors wide open. Several police cars were parked nearby with their lights flashing. I asked an officer what had happened, telling him I'd called it in and seen them drive up this way, hoping it'd make him more inclined to tell me the update. As soon as the guys hit the intersection, police were already waiting; just as it appeared, they'd left it there, yanked the keys and bailed on foot... and police already had three of them in custody.\n\nI still laugh, imagining them in a holding cell, going, \"We waited, we looked, we checked, nobody saw us, so how the hell was there already an ambush waiting?\" Any time you commit a crime in public, even at night, don't be so sure that nobody can see you.",

        "text": "This is a X-post from a thread over on /r/AirForce that asked:\n\n*\"SFS: What's the highest rank you've had to apprehend?\"*\n\nLtCol on the flightline in a PL3 area.\n\nCSC had called in a RAM requiring us (2 man SRT, both SRA) to post at the usually unmanned ECP's for the area and check badges in and out for a half hour.\n\n\nRandom silliness ensues for 20 minutes... lots of reminders to people to get their badges out, one redfaced E-7 who didn't have his but had two E-4 willing to vouch for him and one ran inside the nearby ops building to get the MSgt's badge and return with it.\n\n\nThen came the LtCol.\n\n\nI'm glancing at my watch (10 minutes to go) when he comes walking up. I go through the \"Afternoon Sir, we're doing a RAM, need to check your Badge please\" spiel.\n\n\nLtCol: \"Excuse me? Do you not know who I am?\"\n\n\nMe: \"No Sir. Hopefully the badge will clear that up for me. Again, I need to see it as you are attempting to enter a PL3 area\"\n\n\nLtCol: \"I don't have time for this, I need to get out to one of our birds to check on something\"\n\n\nMe: \"I understand sir,we all have our jobs to do; right now, mine is this RAM, as directed by the Wing Commander, to check badges going in and out of the area. (Hoping to resolve what is probably the problem) If you left your badge inside the building right there, I can call for a patrol to swing by and run inside to grab it for you; since you tried to enter, I need to verify you before I can let you depart.\"\n\n\nI reach up to my lapel mike and start to call for the FT to swing by, when he just starts walking past me into the area... my **\"HALT!\"** went over the net.\n\n\nI step back, swing my rifle from my shoulder (this was way back before we got the tacti-cool slings) to port-arms. Somewhere in the distance I hear the siren of at least one bored fellow cop jumping to code-3 enroute to my location...\n\n\nMe: (starting into the full challenge sequence) \"Sir, you need to halt where you are, and put your hand up over your head\" (Gods, I just wanted to get this stupid RAM done and go to chow... now I have at least an hour of bullshit and paperwork ahead of me)\n\n\nLtCol: (Balling his fists up and taking a step toward me since I had stepped back a couple paces) \"Look God Damn it! I have to get to my bird!\"\n\n\nNow, decades later and lots of training, experience and a few psych classes under my hat I know the poor guy had gone into brain loop/short circuit, probably based on a mixture of embarrassment and anger, and just wasn't processing the situation properly. Happens all the time with people we deal with when working Law Enforcement... but this was way back when I was a pure Security Troop, living the black and white world of Red Lines.\n\n\nMe: (Taking another step back and jacking a round in the chamber of my M-16 ) **\"HANDS UP NOW! I WILL USE NECESSARY FORCE!\"**\n\n\nI believe it was that unmistakable sound of the bolt sliding and locking a round in the chamber that finally broke through to the LtCol that he had, in fact, done fucked up. Lightbulb now fully on over his head, his hand sprang up as well, and he started to apologize.\n\n\nUnfortunately for him, I was now in full on 'In for a penny, in for a pound' mode. I had to run the full course now.\n\n\nMe: \"Turn around! Drop to your knees! Fall forward and lay flat, arms out! Palms up! Spread your feet! Don't move!\"\n\n\nThe LtCol, now compliant, quickly did everything as told. Just as I got him fully \"at a disadvantage\", the Fire Team arrived in full code-3 glory of lights and siren. Three of my peers were out, rifles raised, almost before the [Peacekeeper](https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4151/5095650802_b043ec46cd_b.jpg)  came to a full stop (pretty damn impressive considering what a bitch getting into/out of the things was).\n\n\nOne started jabbering on the radio, one took overwatch, and the other took my rifle as I handed it to him, saying \"It's Hot\". I then stepped in, dropped a knee on the LtCol's kidney, and run through the cuffing and prone search process. As I finished (still no badge on him) and stood up, I realized we had an audience...\n\n\nOur shift leader (1Lt) had arrived and was walking up, there was a crowd of about 20 ground crew watching from well outside the area, and I could see a full bird exiting the nearby ops building and also headed this way. I quickly got my rifle back and briefed the Lt on the full story.\n\n\nAs I finished, we both turned to see the Col at the ECP, badge in hand. I stepped up, checked it, stepped back and saluted, as did the Lt. Before either of us said anything, the Col looked down at the LtCol and asked \"What did you do Jack?\" The LtCol just sighed and said \"Left my badge inside, acted like an ass out here. Sorry.\" The Col looked at us and asked, \"Can I take him?\n\n\nOur Lt just shook his head and said, \"Sorry Colonel, he has to go in as part of the processing. You can come sign for him in about an hour if you'd like.\"\n\n\nThe Col just nodded, looked at me and said \"Thanks for not killing him, he loses his brain sometimes\".\n\n\nWe pulled him off the ground, packed him in the LE car that had also shown up for transport, and headed back to the station to clear my rifle and do all the paperwork.\n\n\nFun times.",

        "text": "Alright, so I'm new, lurker and decided I had my own story to share. It is entertaining enough, so hopefully it's in the right spirit of the sub. \n\nSo, me. I am (at the time of the story) a humble gas station worker. Mostly midnights. Officers come in, I beg them to partake of hotdogs/coffee/soda/donuts for free (we are allowed to give away our brand food to officers...for obvious reasons, and my manager and I agreed to also include EMT and Firefighters in this deal). I clean, I stock, blah blah, typical stuff. Cars pull up. We have 20+ pumps. People fueling up. Overall, quiet night. \n\nSuddenly, I hear a scream. I look out the window. A man rips across the parking lot, leaps into the driver's seat of a car that she was fueling up and starts to drive away. The woman fueling the car begins to shriek \"HE'S STEALING MY CAR AAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUGGGHH-\" You get the point. I have the phone up and dailed in an instant.\n\n\"911\"\n\n\"There's a man stealing a car-\" I give quick details on car/model/make and spit out the address. \n\nNow, look. I know they have to ask these questions, but the Operator begins. I swear this is the most impatient I have ever been with them, I'm normally very calm. After all, Midnights were my thing. \n\nWeapons? Threats? So on. I'm saying, no, heard nothing except the one scream BUT HE IS DRIVING AWAY RIGHT NOW PLEASE SEND- no, I was not personally threatoned...yes, I work here...yes, I'll be here to fill out a report...\n\nMeanwhile, hearing this woman's scream, men run across the lot (which is huge, but these guys were likely soldiers, it's a military town) and rips the door open. Another man jerks the thief out and begins whaling on him, stomping him for daring do such a thing in a crowded gas station. A third man jumps in the car, brake lights flash and it stops, shuts off. I'm outside the door now, listening to the questions. \n\n\"NO I AM NOT HURT BUT HE IS-\" She asks a question. \"HE'S GETTING THE SHIT BEAT OUT OF - NO WEAPONS INVOLVED!\" I'm frustrated, I know she has to ask but damn now there's this screaming woman, three pissed off guys who seemed intent on near killing this guy but are, oddly enough, slowing down to look at something the thief is pulling out, and...SUCCESS!\n\nSeven cop cars pull up. The men around the thief begin talking right away, oddly insistant on the officers looking at whatever they have taken from the man. The woman is trying to take her car and leave, but...what's this? Some officers walk over, block her from the car and I can hear them begin to grill her. Another officer talks to the man, body language respectful and apologetic. What is going on?\n\nHere's the full story: Soldier goes to war, deployment set for twelve months. Six months in, he can't get his girlfriend to answer his messages at all anymore. He sends a friend by his house. The place is CLEANED OUT and his car, which he bought and signed in his own name, is gone. Girlfriend has absconded with secret boyfriend. \n\nSoldier gets back into town, files paperwork. His friends take him out one night, and of course they stop to get energy drinks before the celebration of him making it back. The Soldier looks over, casually, and sees not only HIS CAR, but the girl herself! So he takes the spare key he kept on him, runs over and takes the car back! While doing so, he is seen by other soldiers (military town) who leap into action, drag him from his own car and begin to fight, until he produces paperwork (apparently he'd been carrying the paperwork in his CURRENT car to file on base Monday) proving that he is the owner; his insurance cards, registration and title, which he had kept in hopes of the car being restored to him quickly. \n\nThen the officers pull up, the three soldiers sheepishly hand over the Soldier's evidence and apologize (he waved it off, saying if it had been a car theft they would have saved some poor woman a lot of headache) and then gets back in his car, pulls up to a parking space and comes inside, where I learn the whole story from him. He buys energy drinks, his friends toast him in an energy fueled rush and I offer them each a hotdog. After they leave, the officers that didn't cart her off come in and also partake of free goodies, and we marvel at the luck he had that night. We share a moment of empathy, shaking our heads sadly, for the woman who let him pay for and insure a car (luckily completely in his own name with her as an added driver) and then left with it while he was getting shot at.\n\nEDIT: Took out unneeded question at the bottom.

        "text": "It was a slow start to the afternoon shift.  The computer wasn't working, IT wasn't helping, and my partner almost had to run lights and sirens back to the office for an emergency code brown.  We should have known the night wouldn't be the best.    \n\n  \nWe were on our way back to our zone after the code brown.  This zone was the bane of the agency's existence.  It was one long road in the Southwest part of the county.  The neighborhoods off the road was a mix of run down trailer parks and the ghetto.  80% of the population were either mentally ill or alcoholics.  Not exactly fun for a Friday night starting at 1600 hours.    \n  \n\"SO Unit, copy agency assist at [address].  60 year old female with severe bleeding, actively fighting EMS\"   \n\nMy partner, we'll name him Bruce, immediately flipped the disco show.  \"10-4, enroute.\"    \n  \nWe could hear the yelling even before we arrived.  Dispatch held traffic for us because of the fighting.  When we rolled up, we found a young woman, the EMS guy, and the old woman.  The old woman was literally shooting blood out of her destroyed artery. She was actively resisting while yelling \"Fuck you\" to everyone within earshot.   The younger woman there was her daughter, trying to force her to get care for her life-threatening wound.  We also had another deputy arrive on scene.\n  \nEven though the woman was fighting, she wasn't really presenting a real danger to anyone.  I called over the radio to dispatch to allow them to lift traffic.   \n  \n\"SO Unit, this channel is held,\" came dispatch's snarky reply when I called out.  As a reserve, I'm signed on under the primary officer's CAD login.  When we are shown on a call, only his number shows.  No matter how I sign in, even when I advise dispatch I'm there, they always seem to forget I exist.  I'm used to it by now, but my annoyance showed in my response.    \n\"10-4, I'm *on* that call.  Please lift traffic.\"   \n  \nFinally, we force the woman on the gurney and get her in the ambulance.  We finally get a moment to talk.   \n  \nApparently, the woman's foot fell through the floor and she tried to catch herself in the kitchen window.  Her hand went straight through the glass and cut herself pretty deep.  Because she's drunk, our state law allows us to force her into treatment, considering the fact that she's unable to care for herself and she has shown indication of harming herself (though her refusal for treatment of a life threatening injury).  That also meant one of us had to ride in the ambulance with her.   \n  \n\"I'm the one without a car, so it would make sense for me to go.  You guys take the investigation here, I'll take the ride.\"  I hoped I wouldn't regret my volunteering.   \n\nBruce laughed.  \"Have fun.\"  I called into dispatch that I would be riding in the ambulance, and we headed across town.   \n\nShe was trying to kick at us the whole time.  I held her legs down as the EMS guys tried to treat her.   \n  \n\"WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST LEAVE ME AT HOME?  I DIDN'T WANT TO GO,\" she yelled.   \n  \n\"Ma'am, because you would have died otherwise.\"  I was starting to get tired of this.  \n  \n\"You guys have any soft restraints?\"  I asked, hoping to tie her down.   \n  \n\"We used them on the last guy.  Sorry.\"   \n  \n\"Wait for it...,\" the other EMS guy called.  At this point I looked at our subject.  She had started calming down and her face turned a little pale.  The blood loss finally took the fight out of her.   \n\nWhen we finally arrived at the hospital, I keyed up my mic.  \n\n\"SO Unit to dispatch, we've arrived at the hospital\"   \n  \n\"SO Unit, 10-4.\"  About 10 seconds later.  \"SO Unit, what call are you on?\"   \n  \n*Sigh* \"I'm on Bruce's call.\"    \n   \n\"10-4\"    \n  \nBruce met me there and we filled out the required forms.  Our subject needed her artery repaired, but she ended up being okay.  \n\nI got blood on my uniform though.  That pissed me off.  Especially when, at this point, it wasn't even 2100 yet.  We were on shift until 0400.  ",

        "text": "Let me preface this by pointing out that I was raised in rural Brazil. Not only is it a third world country but my father was also a cop, so I have a million of these stories simply due to how these interactions are a part of everyday life for me. \n\n\nBack in Brazil my father very rarely had nights off. This specific night, however, he had promised he'd be off duty and even shut off his radio to prove it. Me, my mother, and my father all got in the car and drove through the unpaved streets towards the nice restaurant we originally planned on attending. When we pulled in, we could make out a crowd of confused and generally distraught people gathering in the parking lot. After parking we cautiously exited the car a particularly disheveled man broke through the crowd and half-yelled \"call the police!\", my father, not missing the opportunity for an action movie quote, replied \"I am the police.\", at which point this story turns more comical than scary. \n\n\nTurns out a few minutes before we arrived two armed men came in and robbed a portion of the clients in the restaurant. Since this is Brazil, expecting police to arrive that night for a robbery was as unlikely as hoping the men would come back and return the money out of the goodness of their hearts. We were pretty resigned to the fact that our dinner night just became manhunt night so we got in the car with my father to drive around the block and maybe catch a glimpse of one of the guys while the situation was radioed in. Mind you, [the streets in Brazil look like this at night](http://brasil.indymedia.org/images/2014/05/532150.jpg) and our [little Palio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Palio) wasn't exactly an armored car, so my mother and I are understandably wishing this would just be over. \n\n\nFast forward a few minutes and we spot a dark figure moving pretty quickly on the right side of the street. Since Brazil isn't really the place for nightly strolls, my father drives up and slowly rolls down the window asking how he was doing. Without missing a beat, this man pulls a gun and points it into the car window *in front of* my mother's face towards my father, and my dad calmly pulls *his* .357 towards the robber. Now we have this situation where my mother is 2 inches from two parallel revolver barrels, I am sitting in the back quite literally pissing my pants, and my dad is calling this guys bluff on a dark unpaved road in a third world country known for its violence against cops. Thankfully, this ~~Mexican~~ Brazilian standoff ended when the armed robber decided that he'd rather not take his chances with being first to the trigger and ran like hell (we later found out that the other guy had already been caught by this time). \n\n\nMy dad called in his description and latest location, and an hour later we stopped by the scene of several police cars carrying the two apprehended suspects. When asked who was responsible for responding to the call, no one spoke up, and my dad just smiled at me as we slunk off into the night to have our dinner. \n\n",

All of his friends had gone out and got drunk and high on weed, he was the only sober person in the vehicle. On their way back to school they hit a curb going 80mph for an onramp, spun a 180 in to the oncoming lane, and slammed in to a fully loaded semi truck hauling a few dozen head of cattle.\n\nEveryone except for the DOA was ejected from the car, and mostly walked away with a few bruises, broken bones, and road rash. The one sober kid who was wearing his seat belt had an internal decapitation between his atlas and axis cervical vertebrae and died instantly. \n\nThe moment this job was made real for me was that afternoon after I had to scrape a mothers son off a highway, and then go to her house and tell her in person that her son had died. I'll never be able to forget her plaintive and anguished screams. It's something that digs in to your soul and never lets go.\n\n His phone was blowing up with texts and calls from all his friends and relatives desperately trying to get in touch with him, it was just utterly miserable.\n\nI went home. Cried like a baby. And drank a fifth of wild turkey whiskey. I could see myself in his position not too many years before. All the stupid risks I took and my general cavalier attitude at his age came flooding back. \n\nI'm many years and many states removed from that incident, but every time I go and visit my folks, I take a midnight ride to the local cemetery and leave a flower on his grave.\n\nWhen I looked down on the slab when he first came in, the only thing that went through my head was \"There but for the grace of god go I.\" I had a bit of a sketchy upbringing.\n\nI haven't typed this up before, and I've only told the story to a few people before. This is a bit of catharsis for me. It was both a huge shock to the system even years later, and also an event that solidified for me how important what I do is for the people left behind.\n\nRIP Isaac. I'll never forget you brother.

        "text": "I was on patrol on the freeway, stuck in heavy traffic during the early morning commute, when a biker (Harley style) rolled up alongside my passenger window and started waving at me. I rolled my window down.\n\nHe yelled to me so I could hear over the traffic noise, \"Hey, there's a big rig in the far left lane back there. He's causing all kinds of traffic.\" I yell back, \"Alright, I'll check it out.\"\n\nI pulled to the shoulder to see if the big rig would pass me. In my state, big rigs are limited to the right lane, or one lane over to pass. But not the far left lane in a five lane freeway.\n\nSure enough, here comes a big rig, in the fast lane. I pull in behind him, turn on all my disco lights, and help him get over to the shoulder. I make my approach, already thinking, *What the heck, man?*\n\nHere comes his side of the story. He tells me that there was a biker on his right, weaving crazily, and he didn't want to hit him, so he made a lane change to the left. As he did this the biker stayed right next to him, so he moved over again. The biker still stayed alongside him, so he moved over one more time, and found himself in the fast lane, and the biker took off. Based on the biker's riding, he thought if he didn't move he'd hit the guy, and he was trying to avoid doing that.\n\nI acknowledged what he said, and asked why he was still in the fast lane by the time he got to me. \"With all the traffic, I couldn't get over. No one would let me in.\" Sure, all plausible. Now I'm wishing I spoke to that biker some more.\n\nSo I walk back to my car and consider my options. The law says he can't be in that lane. Or one lane over. Or even one more lane over. He's 4 lanes from where he's allowed to be. And everyone hates trucks in the fast lane.\n\nBut the driver says the action he took was what he thought was the safest. He wasn't getting any advantage in traffic, so there was no way being in that lane was going to benefit him.\n\nI return back to the driver. \"Alright sir, here's the deal. I can't, in good conscience, give you a ticket for doing what you thought was the safest thing, especially when you weren't risking the safety of anyone else. But in the future, just pull to the right shoulder and let the crazy people continue on.\"\n\nHe replies, \"Thank you, sir. You know, I was thinking, I'm always on the road, and I always call in drunk drivers and crashes and stuff to help you guys, but I was thinking, man, if this guy writes me a ticket for this, I'm not gonna do that anymore. So I appreciate it. You guys are alright.\"\n\nI wished him well and he was on his way. ",

        "text": "So, I'm the turnkey.  Which is mostly a name for someone who takes the heat for everyone else.  Pretty much, I'm supposed to run the cell block.  Used to be like that... now not so much.  But it is what it is.\n\nSo I'm standing there organizing breaks and fielding calls about what's been done and what needs to be done, and all of which I have no idea of because they've given another person that job and I haven't seen them all day.  My Sgt. Is standing next to me and we're discussing who we can send to break and how the hell we're going to get that inmate to OIG when we have no escort bosses.  When the trouble making wing starts banging and one boss is rushing to turn the water off.\n\nWhat the fucks going on here now?  The boss turning the water off explains it's because they don't want food loafs.  Oh well then,  they'll stay unhappy then.  Go to break.\n\nHe goes to break, and next we look up the other CO assigned to the wing is behind a shield and there's our well known shit thrower with his hand out the food slot and a bottle with a brown liquid in it.  Well, fuck.  This about the food loafs?  And why is 5 cell banging again?  \n\nThe bottle flings some poo, but doesn't hit the officer.  Well come to find out, 6 cell the shit thrower was upset about his food loaf and had stopped the officers from feeding 5 cell his own food loaf.  (Why did yall open that food slot anyways?  They're made to slide under the door for a reason.)\n\nSgt. Takes a deep breath, grabs the food loaf and starts to head on the wing.  \"I better not get any shit on me today, I'm tired of changing in the garage.\"\n\nWhich is when I remembered our conversation that morning about how he'd stripped in the garage and it was a good thing too because the minute he opened that door his kid came running.  \"I got it Sarge, they aren't going to chunk on a woman, even me.\"  I don't believe this for a second, I've written a lot of cases on these guys so their levels wouldn't drop.  But fuck it, I don't have any kids to go home to.  And if I get shit thrown on me, I'm claiming the rest of the day a mental health day.\n\nSo I grab the food loaf out of his hand, open the gate and hand him the keys.  \n\nSarge feels bad, \"I can't let you do that.\"\n\n\"Well, now I'm committed and doing it anyway.\"  And off I go, head strong and praying if I get hit it doesn't soak through.\n\nSarge is following me though, we're in this together at this point.  \"Put that bottle up 6 and let me feed 5.\" I say, not slowing down because I'm headstrong and stupid.  I'm not thinking anything at this point, pass the food loaf and close the food slots is all I got.\n\nThe bottle goes away and 6 says some shit about how he wouldn't throw that at me.  \"6 yesterday you told me you don't throw piss, you throw shit... that lookS oddly like shit and piss mixed in that bottle.\"  Food loaf delivered and slot closed, now trying to reason with a guy holding a run hostage with a shit bottle.  What the hell is my life?\n\n\"Well, it's Lt. Somethings fault!  He put me here!\"\n\n\"6, I was there, Sarge put you there and you had no problem going when you threw liquid at the new boot.  Remember, I moved you into this cell.\"\n\nSarge is dealing with 5 cell, apparently we've given him the wrong food loaf.  Get him another, alls good.  \"Hey Sarge let me holler at you,\" from 6.\n\nSarge takes the two steps to be level with me, neither of us are dumb enough to stand in front of his cell.\n\nOut comes the bottle, sarge has some basketball steps going on.  His feet did a dance of some sort while I back stepped I almost slipped on the shit already on the floor.\n\n\"Woah, woah.  Not with that damned bottle in your hand!\"  Sarge isn't amused and his voice is a little too high, fuck it I think.  Mission accomplished enough.\n\nApparently 6 is actually upset that he's moving to a hot box because he keeps threatening to throw shit on people. \n\nFuck it, sarge will see what he can do.  Which is really just putting it off until everyone's had their breaks and we've got the man power to make him move.",

        "text": "I worked security at my last college for two years, weekend night shift from 2100-0600 or so. Most of the stuff we dealt with was pretty normal college fare: Minors with alcohol, drugs, car accidents, suicide attempts, facilities problems, you get the gyst.\n\nWell I'd been there for a solid year and hadn't gotten to have an actual \"vacation\" except for a couple day trips here and there. My boss was a fantastic guy, former detective and LT at our local department. When christmas came around he basically told me \"Go home for a week or two and get a break.\" Not one to turn down some time off, I agreed.\n\nMy parents were still living on the west coast and I was in the midwest. So I planned a 10 day trip home, made sure my shifts were covered, filled in the new guy on how to run weekends and flew home.\nI was four days into my vacation when one morning my phone rings. I roll out of bed, still mostly asleep and look at the number. Oh shit, it's one of the local cops we worked with at the school. This oughta be good.\n\nMe: \"This is Seatown93, what's up?\"\n\nOfc: \"Bro, you're the worst good luck charm I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nMe: \"Huh?\"\n\nOfc: \"You remember that bet we made a couple months ago?\"\n\nI thought back and immediately remembered what he was talking about. Like most cops, this guy had a really dark sense of humor that I just so happened to share. After responding to two suicide attempts and an \"almost\" overdose in the span of four weeks, he joked that we'd probably find someone dead before the semester was out. I said no way.\n\nMe: \"Yeahhhhh...\"\n\nOfc: \"Well, you owe me, because it totally just happened. I'm on scene now.\"\n\nIt felt like someone kicked me in the gut and I groaned.\n\nMe: \"Shit...student?\"\n\nOfc: \"Nah, one of the homeless folks. Investigators said he probably had too much to drink, stumbled over here in the cold (It was getting to be around -20F at night then) fell asleep and didn't wake up. No evidence of foul play so we're going with accidental so far.\"\n\nMe: \"I leave for a week and you asshats start finding dead people on campus. What the hell?\"\n\nOfc: \"Hey, not my fault you're cursed. Just be glad you're not writing the report, it's gonna be a looooong one.\"\n\nWe chatted for a bit and I called my boss. He verified everything and said he'd brief me more once I got back. Fast forward to when I return and we go through the details, I check out the report and it seems to be just what we had thought; bad accident, nobody at fault.\n\nMe: \"So...I'm guessing this means you don't want me taking time off any time soon?\"\n\nBoss: \"I can't stop you, but it seems everyone stays alive while you're around.\"\n\nFunnily enough, I didn't leave the state for my remaining time there and guess what? No more dead people on campus.",

        "text": "This is my first post here but I am so glad to finally have something to contribute. Any criticism is welcome. \n\nI had been waiting months for this night and it was finally here. The night i could go on a ridealong with my dream department. The only thing thing that stood in my way was an hour and a half drive with blowing snow. \n\nThe night started out fairly calm we started out with a potential vandalism where there was absolutely nothing the officer I was with could do. The owner of the vehicle that was damaged didn't even know an approximate date for when the damage occured so after talking to her for a while we left. We drive along for a while do two traffic stops or so while i ask the officer any question that pops into my head, which honestly wasn't very many. Then the officer says the q word. He was apologizing for the night being slow, as if he had some control over it. I told him that I was just happy to be there in a police car. \n\nThat's when we get it. A call which we both thought would be nothing but we were bored and it was almost midnight so we decided to back up the closest officer. It was a suspicious person call where the caller stated that there were two people standing on his corner acting weird. So we pull up and immediately shit starts to go down. We see a car driving off with a lady chasing after it, and a dude on the other side of the street looking anywhere but at us. So we immediatley flip a bitch and at this point the dude with his head down( we'll call him red as he was wearing a red hoodie) starts running and the lady( who we'll call DD for many reasons) takes off too. \n\ni get out and follow the officer i was with ( we'll call him ofc1). Ofc1 immediately grabs red but DD is nowhere to be found. Ofc1 starts questioning red and i hear weird sounds coming from a car behind me so i look at it while keeping close to ofc1. At this point backup shows up (ofc2) and simultaneously DD pops up from under the car Ofc2 grabs her and she starts going into her pocket for something so Ofc2 stops her and pulls out a pill bottle full of meth. This wasn't a small pill bottle either this was a giant pill bottle entirely full of meth, felony levels. \n\nWhile this is happening (Ofc3) who was actually the original responding officer but had just gotten done talking with the copmplainant, shows up and grabs red from Ofc1. Ofc1 then sees another dude we'll call Young Blood around a corner and goes to grab him and pat him down. \n\nAt this time we find out from DD that RED was never involved, but he was in the wrong place at the wrong time as he has 3 warrants out. \n\nParamedics have been called for Young Blood since he has cuts on his legs. \n\nOfc 1 goes back to DD who has been placed in his car and questions her for a while after reading her her rights of course. From her we find out that young blood had pointed a gun at her earlier in the night. We call for more back up including the sgt and a k9 to help look for the gun. At this point Ofc4 shows up and grabs DD so ofc1 goes looking for the gun and I follow him since I am his responsibility. Luckily it had just finished snowing so we were able to see YoungBloods tracks all the way back to the corner where this all started, so ofc 1 and I track him. At one house his tracks looked extra suspicious, doubling back on themselves and cutting through a yard where before he had stuck to the sidewalk, so we decide to check this yard for the gun, but don't have any luck. \n\nWhen the k9 shows up we take him back to the house we thought the gun would be at, honestly not expecting him to find it, the dog searches for a while but no luck, but as they leave the k9 officer takes his dog through the yard, and he triggers! The dog starts digging and we hear his claws hit metal. so Ofc1 grabs a bag and digs more where the dog did and finds the gun. \n\nSo we take everybody to jail where we spend the next hour or so booking them. There is also a huge line as it turns out everyone else in the county was super busy that night too. \n\nBut i did learn the effect of the q word and had an amazing night.\n\n",

        "text": "Hey TFTSQ. I've been encouraged by /u/El_Mono_Rojo to post here, and we've collaborated on this story based on the same incident. For simplicity's sake I've reused his details where pertinent.\n****\n\n“I mean, I guess we’ll run regular calls for a minute.” EMR looked at the road. “I kinda tried to avoid that, but it’s that or clock it early, so…” I celebrated internally. We had been doing casework stuff all day, and while that was interesting, I was more than happy to really try to get into trouble with the half hour or so we had left on shift. I had done other ridealongs in black-and-whites, and I really liked roaming around, trying to guess where the next incident would be. “Let’s see what’s in the laptop.” I cracked open the Toughbook and hit refresh. A chorus of beeps and alerts cascaded over me, the last 2 hours’ priority calls all coming through at once. It was super cool (to me, anyway) to get to run the terminal in the unmarked, a job I was doing my best (and failing miserably) to do with any kind of speed or precision. “Well, we didn’t really miss a lot,” I said, sifting through a bunch of noise complaints and DV’s. “Nothing really near us either.” EMR sighed. “Guess we’ll head back over to the East side, see what’s going on over there. Maybe swing through the barrio, too. Wouldn’t be a night shift without it.” He banged a U turn and started over that way. “At least I didn’t have to put my vest on all shift,” he quipped. “See, look, now you’ve jinxed it,” I replied. He laughed.\n\nAs Foreigner quietly played in the background, the laptop squawked its awkward tone. I opened the callout – “Another domestic,” I announced. “11496 Pine Baron Drive.” EMR perked up. “Where? I don’t know that road.” I was surprised. The dude knew the area better than freaking Google Maps. I opened the map (after some prompting on how) and turned the laptop. “Huh. I think we’re closest.” He pondered the idea of going. I could see him weighing out dealing with a domestic – we didn’t have to go, another unit was also close and already dispatched, with 2 more close behind. “Downstairs neighbor says he can hear yelling from upstairs. Female saying ‘let me leave’. That sounds weird,” I read off the terminal. I looked over at EMR, pondering the map. “Sure, why not. We better, it’s right around the corner.” He hooked a quick right into the subdivision and started looking at street signs. “I’m not seeing it,” he said. “Me neither. Do you think we passed it?” I responded. He pulled over and looked at the laptop, just as a marked unit slowly rolled by. “5 bucks says he’s going to the same place,” I said, pointing at the Interceptor. EMR dropped in behind and followed him into the next block.\n\nWe arrived in front of the address. The other unit hopped out and made straight for the front door.  EMR waved him over. “Hey, we got it too. Let me put my vest on real quick.” The guy (Norris) nodded, looked me over and stood at the end of the front walk. After a brief wait, the three of us walked up the front steps. The first guy knocked on the door. **tap tap tap**. Pause **tap tap tap**. “Police. Come to the door.” The storm door opened a few inches. “Yeah sure, what’s wrong?” A man, maybe 30, poked his head around the corner. “We need to talk to you,” Norris said. “Why don’t you open the door so we can talk.” The guy pushed open the glass door and stood in the doorway. “Sure. There’s nothing going on, it’s all fine.” He looked confused. “I didn’t call.” At that moment, the oddest sound a human being can make reached my ears. It sounded like a cross between a whale call, a cow, and that old video of the Grape Lady, something which written would likely be spelled “mauooooowwwww…..” All three of us craned our necks, trying to see where it had come from. “Uhhh, clearly something is up,” Norris responded. “Someone doesn’t sound too good in there.” \n\n“It’s just my mom,” the man said. “No problems.” Before he could say anything else, another “MAUOOOWWWW” pierced the calm night. “Ok. Can I just look inside, make sure everything is cool?” The man pondered for a moment. “Will I be arrested?” “No, I just want to look real quick, make sure everyone is fine.” The man looked pensive. “Ok. You, and only you can come in. I’m inviting you in under full pretense so you can come.” That was a weird thing to say, I thought. Is this one of the sovereign citizen assholes? The first guy pushed past him into the back of the house. EMR stepped over the threshold as well and opened the door to get a better look. “Woah! Hey! Sir! You cannot come in! I did not invite YOU in! This is illegal under the Constitution.” Yup. Definitely one of those guys. “Just calm down for a minute,” EMR told him. “Okay, but sir, you cannot be in here, I did not invite you in. I didn’t invite you. You cannot-” “MAAUUUOOWWWW HE DID HE DID” The moaning (?) came from the back of the house. The first guy immediately came back down the hall. “Dude, hook him up. She’s all messed up.” “Yeah, I know, she’s my mom. Can you tell him-” EMR cut off the man’s address to Norris. “Hey, turn around.”\n\n“What? For what? I didn’t even invite you in!” he protested. He started waving his hands around as he did. “You can’t be in here!” EMR turned him around and pulled his arm up behind him. “Dude. Calm down.” The guy cooperated and seemed to deflate a little. EMR grabbed his radio and chirped dispatch. “6 Alpha 10, put me on scene at Pine Tree. One detained.” The guy suddenly tried to turn around. “What does that…I didn’t do-” EMR pushed him back against the wall. “Seriously. Just calm down.” “Okay, but sir, how can you be in here? I didn’t invite you in. What about him?” He gestured at me with his head. I had one foot on the porch and one in the house, holding the glass door open. Before anyone could say anything else, another “MAAUUOOWWWWWWW” shattered whatever was left of the peace. What was that noise? And what was that smell? Suddenly, the stench of foreign cooking punched me square in the nose. What was that? Lebanese? Serbian? Whatever it was, it was powerful. Was it cabbage? I looked past the three men to see green…something all over the floor, and what looked like a human figure. Was it naked? Was it what was making the noise? I craned my neck to see further, but was interrupted by the two officers taking the man to the Interceptor. EMR looked at me. “Stay put,” he ordered. They dragged the still-protesting man by, as another wave of food (?) smell washed over me. Was it Egyptian? Moroccan? Did it have liver in it?\n\nEMR came back in. I watched him beeline straight to the back and ask the woman what was wrong. I couldn’t make out too much of the conversation, but I heard her mention her neck a few times. Uh-oh. The first guy went back in as well and started talking to the woman. I stuck my head in and asked “Anything I can do to help?” “Yeah, make sure he doesn’t kick my window out,” the first guy responded. I took a glance outside towards the backseat, as two more units pulled up outside. They slowly wandered up and I held the door open, trying to be useful. They both gave me a look, something I was used to by now. “Ridealong. I’m with Alpha 10.” I jerked my thumb over my shoulder at EMR. They both had one of those “Ah I see” moments and headed in. They checked out the back real quick, where Norris and EMR were talking to the lady. The new units and EMR cleared the upstairs, as Norris called for an ambulance. “6 Charlie 16, request a four at the Pine Tree scene. Priority.” The woman then asked him something, which I couldn’t hear. “Maam, we can’t move you. We’re not medics. If your neck is broken, we can’t touch you.” Oh, shit. Not good. A chorus of “MMAAAUUOOWWW” greeted this statement. “I know. It hurts. Let me take these pots off of you, okay?” Uhhh, what? Did I hear that right? “NONONO leave them on – muuuuhhhhhhh….” The woman’s protest was cut short by a more guttural cry. At this point, the upstairs gang came back down, having cleared the bedrooms. “Hey, do you have any spare gloves?” one unit asked the other. “I’ve got some in my trunk,” EMR volunteered. “I’ll go grab ‘em,” I offered. I had to get away from that door, and more importantly that smell. I was interested in what was going on inside, but I was more invested in the long-term damage to my olfactory bulbs. “Sure. Top left, in the first aid kit.” EMR pointed. I scurried over to the trunk, grateful for the fresh air and the opportunity to help. As I rooted through extra thigh holster straps and a ballistic shield, I heard a voice say “Excuse me?” I turned, kit in hand, to find the definition of Midwestern housewife staring at me. Short, plump with a haircut straight from a 90’s sitcom. “What’s going on?” “Oh, maam, I shouldn’t talk about it, I don’t really know what I can say. I’m not an officer. Perhaps this gentleman can answer your question?” Another unit had just arrived and was marking out.\n\nI unwittingly sent the problem towards the unsuspecting patrolman. I later learned that I had done a faux pas, that this lady was notorious for asking about a thousand questions every time there was a police event in her neighborhood. Oops. I quickly returned with the gloves for the poor souls who had to work in the kitchen. All I could see was something all over the floor. Was it spinach? Kale? I couldn’t see the woman, just the mess that extended out into the hallway and a bunch of units standing in the kitchen. About the same time I got back, the medics pulled onto the block. I stationed myself on door duty once more, hoping that holding the door open would dissipate the smell somewhat. A unit poked his head outside, and warned the medics “You guys are gonna want gloves. She has stuff all over her. I think it’s food.” I had been holding the door for a few minutes, and consequently hadn’t seen too much. I caught EMR’s eye and he came over. “Check this out,” he said. “So they got into an argument, over who knows what. They started fighting, tore the kitchen all up. He got that smelly stuff, like everywhere. It’s all over the downstairs. In the end, he got her real good in the face, laid her out.” He paused. “Then he…put pots…on her?” His tone was inquisitive. “Like, he stacked them up?” I asked. “Yeah! She had like 6 pots and pans just laying on her!” EMR replied. “They were all just…on her.” At that point, the loudest “MAUOOWWWW” of them all shattered my eardrums. This, I later found, was the medic crew sitting the lady up and wrapping her in a shock blanket, which was necessary because the son had cut all her clothes off with a knife. He’d given her a few wounds with the knife as well. The medics led her outside and strapped her to a stretcher, and loaded her up quickly. Her neck wasn’t broken, but I did hear someone say “broken orbital bone.” Ouch. Turns out, the good one he got in on her was with a frying pan, Babe Ruth style, right in the face. Damn. \n\nAt this point, 8 or 9 units had marked out and were milling around. They began to take witness statements from the downstairs neighbors and just generally bullshit around the way extra units do onscene, while two units were dealing with the housewife ping-ponging between them with questions. I looked over to see two Middle Eastern guys, looking confused and awkwardly standing in the middle of the scene. EMR walked over, and I figured I should follow, seeing as I was attached to him after all. “Did you call?” he asked them. “Yes we…live downstairs. This is the fourth time you have come,” one said. “Is he going to jail?” “Yeah, he’s gonna get booked,” EMR told them. “What happened?” “Well, we called because we could hear her yelling. They fight a lot.” EMR took a formal statement from them and told them that the son had a mental history and would be going to jail, and they could go back inside once everything was done (they lived in the downstairs apartment). All that was left was for Norris to take pictures of the house for his report, so as everyone else stood around, I snuck inside to take a peek.\n\nImmediately, the smell was 10,000 times worse. I had held the door open for about 30 minutes before I gave up. It had done nothing. It smelled like someone had cooked Satan’s asshole in one of those pots that the lady had had stacked on her. What was it? Afghan? Azerbaijani? It looked like wet green newspaper, and it was everywhere. The kitchen, the hallway, the dining room – nowhere in the downstairs had escaped. The toilet was full of clothes – the ones the son had cut off. The kitchen was a mess – the medics had thrown the pots willy-nilly off of the woman, the table was upturned, a chair lay broken in the corner. But God, the smell! I ended up having that cooking (Namibian? Lithuanian?) stuck in my nose for about a day. I walked out for some fresh air, and found EMR, who was ready to pack up and leave. He smiled at me. “I had to vest up after all, and gotta go over to the station nearby for some hand sanitizer, try and get this dude’s B.O. off my hands. Which is great.” “Why is that good?” I asked. He winked at me. “Overtime pay.” I looked at my phone. 12:01. You gotta be kidding. We rolled over there, relatively traffic free. “Dude, what was that noise that lady was making?” he asked me. I shook my head. How could I respond to that when I couldn’t even process what it sounded like? “Dude, that’ll…that might haunt my dreams.” I never did get a follow up.\n",

        "text": "This is my version of this event. To see it from \"Mower's\" perspective, go here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/41wj98/ridealong_the_slow_night_ridealong_perspective/\n\nIt was interesting to see what details we remembered differently (this happened a few months ago). Good example of what court testimony is like!\n\n________________________\n\n\n“Well, I guess we could try the barrio before we turn it in. Worth a shot…” I pulled out into traffic after making a 7-11 pit stop and headed towards my old stomping grounds. I felt a little embarrassed the night was uneventful, as though it was something I could control. Even though it was his second time out with me, I thought my ride along was disappointed we weren’t experiencing something worthy of a write-up. “Sorry it’s so slow. Weird really – the weather is perfect, people are out, there’s just no *stabbing* going on.” \n\n“No problem. I know most of the time things are slow. Gotta get used to it some time for when I’m in the driver’s seat, right?” At least Mower was being cool about it. Still, I had hope for the final couple of hours we would be on the beat. \n\nI prodded him with a few questions, keeping our conversation flowing better than the traffic we were trying to navigate, until the portable radio piped up from the cup holder. “6Alpha-10 start for an unknown situation. Caller states there’s a woman being held hostage and crying for help. He heard screaming and arguing earlier. Caller will be outside the residence and will make himself known. Dispatch clear, 2046 hours.”\n\nI glanced at Mower, eyebrow raised. “Want to check it out? We’re close.”\n\n“Sure, sounds good!” \n\nI swung the car around and headed in the direction of the call, showing Mower how to mark en route from my computer. “These usually turn out to be nothing. Mostly bored schizos wanting to have a talk with someone other than their cat. We’ll head to the barrio after, we should still have time.”\n\nMower took in the lovely strip malls as I made my way to the address. I pulled into the town home complex just behind the marked cruiser that was dispatched. I recognized the guy who got out, Norris, from my time back on patrol. He nodded a hello to me then started for the front door. \n\n“Ok, I guess he’s just going to go knock?” I told Mower as I reached for my external vest. “You can come or stay here, whatever you prefer.”\n\n“I’ll come up.”\n\n“Cool. Just hang back a bit in case this guy is violent.” Norris was already scanning the home for a doorbell. After having no success, he opened the storm door to knock but was met by the home’s occupant coming out. \n\n“You call?” Norris asked in a bored tone.\n\n“No, no. I did not call. You may not come in.” The male, stocky and in his early twenties, had a thick accent.\n\n“Something about a kidnapping?” I asked from behind Norris.\n\n“No. I did not grant consent for you to be here.” The guys eyes swirled and he scanned the parking lot. He shifted his weight and got more agitated. \n\nA low grunting noise crept from inside the home. Norris noticed it as well and peeked around the figure blocking our path. The sound grew louder: a repetitive grunt, almost animal like – the sound a deer surprises you with when it’s either being killed or in the process of making a baby deer.\n\n“What’s that noise?” Norris asked the man. \n\n“No noise.” The man replied. \n\n“Look. Remember me from last week? I was cool, right? I just want to make sure everyone is safe here. Can I check?”\n\nThe man scowled at Norris then glanced at me and back to Morris again. “You, I give consent to violate my fourth amendment right. You,” He pointed to me. “No.”\n\nI feigned an injury to my chest and gave him a struck puppy look. “What did I do?”\n\nNorris pushed by the man as he addressed me. “You do not have consent to enter my residence. I know my rights and you cannot come inside.”\n\n“Fine by me, man.” I watched Norris cautiously check the living room, making his way back to the kitchen area.\n\nThe man seemed to just then notice Mower. He glowered at him, allowing an awkward silence to permeate the immediate area. \n\nNorris suddenly reappeared. “Cuff him. CUFF HIM.” He was a bit shaken, and I knew he meant business. I moved towards the man and sandwiched him against Norris. \n\n“What am I arrested for? What am I arrested for?!?!” He yelled, pulling his arm from our grasps. He was wet with some sour smelling liquid, his shirt soaked through as well. I was able to finally get a hold of a wrist long enough for Norris to secure one cuff, then I cranked his still resisting arm back and used it to leverage him against a wall, his second hand finally coming into reach and joining the first. \n\n“What happened?” I asked the still dazed Norris while holding the squirming man against the wall.\n\n“I… His mom. I don’t know, but we need more units and rescue.” The wheels started turning in his head again and he took charge of the man, leading him out of the house and ignoring his ranting protests of unlawful arrest. “6Alpha-10. Send a few more units and rescue for a female. I don’t know what her injuries are yet.”\n\nI looked back to Mower, now holding the storm door open and looking for directions. “Hang out there for a second, ok?”\n\n“Sure, sure.”\n\nI made my way back the kitchen, the sour smell intensifying with each step. A flimsy three-quarter length swinging door blocked my view and I pushed it open. Inside, the place was a wreck. Pots and pans, food of all sorts, clothing and towels – all were strewn about. The kitchen table and chairs were toppled. Lying face down in the middle of it all was an older woman, her shirt pulled up under her rib cage and a rope tied tightly around her waist. Her pants and blouse were ripped and she had red scrapes all over as well as some signs of bruising. Her eyes rolled in my direction and she groaned that animalistic sound we had heard from the foyer – no distinguishable words, just a pleading, horrific groan. \n\n“Stay still,” I told her, kneeling at her side but not knowing if I should touch her. “Rescue is on the way.” She was covered in the same liquid as the man, presumably the soup stock that the bits of vegetable and chicken scattered on the floor came from. I shoved some of the pooled liquid away from her face but I could see her struggling to lift her head from it. “No, no. Don’t move, you’ll be ok.”\n\nI jogged back through the house to Mower. “I need the first aid kit from the back of my car – the orange bag.” It seemed to dawn on him that this was something slightly more serious than the traffic stops and alarm calls we’d been assisting on all evening and he sprang into action. I was torn between going back the woman and helping Norris pat down the still arguing man by his cruiser. Rather than be decisive, I opted to stay in the doorway between both problems until Mower returned. \n\n“Thanks dude. She’s pretty bad in there. No clue what happened.” I opened the kit and put on the latex gloves. “I’ll be right back.” Mower took over my useless sentry position at the door and I returned to the woman. With my now gloved hands, I checked her for bleeding and scooped more of the liquid from her face area to clear a breathing channel. “I can hear the sirens, ok? You’re going to get help in just a minute.” \n\nShe replied with more bleating pleas for aid. \n\n“Yo, EMR.” Another uniform had arrived – Sketch, a guy I had worked with years before. \n\n“Sketch! We need to clear the rest of the house, no clue if there are any more victims.” He joined me in the kitchen and grimaced as he took in the view. He then shrugged to me as I looked up to him for advice to help the woman. \n\n“Let’s clear the house!” He said, and stomped off towards Mower and the foyer. Instead of waiting for me, he charged up the stairs, no gun drawn, no announcement, just full bore. I hurried to catch up and he realized his mistake upon seeing my gun in my hand. “Good idea.” He mumbled. \n\n“POLICE, ANYONE HERE MAKE YOURSELF KNOWN!” I yelled into the upstairs hallway. No answer returned so I began the slow search, stitch doing a terrible job as my number two. After clearing the upstairs, we ran into the EMT’s coming into the home on the main level, past Mower, still doing a great job as doorman. \n\n“Patient?” One asked me. I wondered why they bothered to come into a hot zone – usually they staged a block away until we gave the all clear, then looked outside and noticed Morris still searching the guy by his car. \n\n“In the kitchen.” I told him. To Sketch, “Did we give them the go ahead to come in?” \n\n“No, Morris did a minute ago over the radio.” He pointed to his ear piece – my radio was tucked into a vest pocket so I must have missed it. \n\nI checked on the woman again, now bleating away at the medics, and then shoved past, gun drawn, to clear the basement. The medics exchanged some confused looks which I ignored, and we cleared another uneventful (save for more mess) floor of the home. \n\nSketch and I had to step over the woman, now rolled onto her back, her neck being stabilized by one of the EMTs, and made our way out the door. It was a few minutes of standing around before things calmed enough to get a handle on the situation. Morris explained to our group, now including Shawn, a newly promoted sergeant I was good friends with, the scenario as he saw it:\n\nThe male was a recent addition to the station’s “Problem Child” list. The week prior, he had assaulted his mother – the woman in the kitchen – and fled the home. It took hours and the coordination of two districts to locate him walking barefoot and in only a pair of shorts through some roads a few miles away. He fought the cops that tried to detain him, getting tazed in the process and ranting about his rights and the government surveillance that was following him around. Morris had been one of those cops to arrest him, so he knew the specific flavor of crazy we were dealing with when we arrived. Mom had bailed Jr. out the day after his arrest, ready to reconcile with her sweet nut-job and apparently everything went well for about a week – until he went off his meds and flipped out again. The roommates in the basement called in the event, hearing things getting out of control when they arrived home from work. The mom informed medics later she had been tied up all day and beaten by her son. Her injuries were severe, broken bones and deep bruising, but the inability to talk or move was due mostly to exhaustion from physically fighting her son – he had about one hundred pounds on her.\n\nMorris bade us ado and took the assailant to jail. Shawn turned to me. \n\n“Decided to grace us with your presence, huh hotshot? Super detective?” He jabbed my vest covered ribs. \n\n“Someone’s got to teach your guys how to do this job. Let me know if you want me to give a refresher to the squad on building clearing.” I tipped my head towards Sketch. \n\nShawn sighed. “Yeah, definitely something we need to improve on. But how about next time, you give me a heads up when you’re going to be in my area? You’re a shit magnet, I’d like some warning.”\n\nI looked to Mower, still standing a little out of the way, and was grateful he got at least a taste of the rainbow of lunacy that comes with this job. \n",

        "text": "So this was a rough night with a not so happy ending.  Little background: I work for a private police department with a little over half as POs the rest are security and we have our own medics.\n\nIt was a rainy night and I was patrolling off-campus dormitories that were hotels converted for the use while larger dorms were built.  This particular \"dorm\" was an all female dorm that had all exterior doors secured.  A little before 4 am I went inside the dorm to eat lunch.  I had unlocked the entry to make the easiest access be directly to me since several ground floor rooms had doors to the outside.  I was in the middle of eating my lunch when \"Dave\" walked in.  I heard the door open and heavy male breathing so at that unusual sound I looked up to see a man with a 2-3 inch cut from his temple to his cheek bleeding all over his shirt.\n\nWhen he spoke his voice was shaky and he had slumped shoulders downcast gaze.  He gave off all the signals of a victim.  After identifying myself and how I could help he told me he had just been mugged and his car stolen.  So I radioed in for a medic and a PO to handle the felony report as I have no investigative authority.  With that done we are kind of staring at each other.  I knew it is going to be a couple of minutes for the other units to show up since it's off-campus.  I hate awkward moments and seeing this guy bleeding all over himself and visibly shaking...well it made for an awkward moment.  So I offered him first aid out of my go bag that we would carry to throw to a downed officer in an active shooter type thing.  He accepted it so I stepped out from behind the desk and headed to my car.  And that's when the situation took a radical turn.\n\nWhen I got to the door, my days of watching westerns kicked in and I decided I didn't like this guy waddling behind me.  I tried a few times to get him to sit down since it was a head injury but he kept refusing.  Then he dropped his hands from his face and his voice stopped being shaky.  His eyes stopped being all submissive like and he said \"Officer, I have a problem\".  Then a mini sledgehammer suddenly appeared out of no where.  I never saw him pull it out, and I still think he conjured it up with voodoo but no matter...it was there.\n\nIn that moment, my mind said \"oh fuck it's a crazy person\".  They always tell you to imagine scenarios so you have an idea how to react.  Well I hadn't thought of an attacker with a sledgehammer so I reacted like I would as if it was a knife.  I was within 21 feet so my mind started screaming \"CREATE SPACE!!\" Over and over.  I now know why you're supposed to charge a guy with a knife when you're that close and not back up...I jumped wwwaaayyyy back  and naturally tripped and fell between a fireplace and some furniture. I landed sideways with my weapon side down and looked up and saw him charging me with his hammer raised.  Since I couldn't stand I jumped from the ground further away and into a corner and Dave kept on coming.\n\nThat's when my instinctive action stopped.  I couldn't create space anymore.  I had no where to go and that's when I cracked for a split second.  I wanted to curl into a ball and beg for my life.  But then I got pissed.  Really pissed.  And since I had no where to go I got up and charged Dave.\n\nTo make an already long story shorter, after I charged him we grappled all over the room.  During that grapple fest, he hit me a few times (I don't remember those but my jaw did), he tried to choke me, he went for my gun, and worst of all he threw me to the ground and got full mount.  After I bucked him off and got up I knew that this fight had to end.  I was heavily winded and there was no way I was going to ground again.  So I shoved him and drew my gun.\n\nI brought it up, pulled the trigger, and I heard a rather piercing \"CLICK\".  Misfire.  That was the biggest what the fuck moment I've ever had.  I managed to shove him again, wrack the slide, and fire twice.  He stopped coming after me then.\n\nSadly Dave didn't make it much longer.  His car was in the parking lot and his pocket knife had his own blood on it and there was a small pool of blood outside the driver side door. I made it out with a sore jaw and some puke later.  I have no regrets, but I'll never consider myself as having \"won\" that fight.  Nobody won that night.",

        "text": "2330 hours. September 2013. My first ride along ever. It was with a veteran Officer with my local PD. He was my SRO and he was driving a brand new Explorer. This thing was a beauty. 0-60 in holy shit.\n\nAnyways, to get to the story. As we're driving towards the North side of town, we notice a red truck that seemed to be having trouble staying in their lane, so just like any other LEO, he pressed on the record button as we increased our speed to reach the perp.\n\nAfter a short mile, we call it in and the lights of freedom are flicked on. We end up stopping on a ramp off the Interstate. It's pretty obvious this person is not fit to drive, but a SFST is still conducted.\n\nNow, to the obvious eye, this guy is hammered. Yet as he sits in the back seat, he refuses to take a breathalyzer. His claims were that he doesn't trust them and wants his doctor to do it for him instead, so our buddy caught another charge with his refusal.\n\nPretty soon, another unit shows up to check on us. With one Officer dealing with our drunk, the other is talking to his girlfriend who was sitting in the passenger seat. She gets tested and she's not intoxicated, she's fit to drive so she will take the truck.\n\nThe girl takes off with the truck as the Officers discuss how attractive she was, and our buddy is in the back seat of the Explorer.\n\nWe get everything finished and are on our way to Detox. The Officer decided that I had not had a fun and exciting ride along, so without hesitation, we go up a huge hill of grass with lights and sirens with the drunk in the back seat going WHOOOOOOO!! the whole time.\n\nThings I learned:\n\nExplorers are nice.\n\nDrunks are fun.\n\nPaperwork for DUI's sucks.\n\nOfficer is one cool guy.",

        "text": "So this happened last year when I was on a work trip.\n\n \n \nFirst a bit of background on my work at the time. The company I worked at made graduation packages, here in Costa Rica schools can purchase these in order to relieve themselves of printing certificates, and also buy them because they're pretty, it's a good business with nice profits as long as you're willing to work hard, these packages normally consists of a book where everyone signs, like a yearbook but without pictures, the certificate holder, the certificate itself, the band that students wear at the graduation and a photography pack that includes 4 to 6 photos. \n \n \n\nSo I was in charge of going to these schools in order to take pictures, and had to go to a particular school that could only be reached after a three hour drive with my partner. Since this school was so far away, and my grandma just repaired her taxi in order to get it up to spec before selling it, she asked us to take that car along in order to get some miles on it and tell her if anything is amiss. I asked my partner if she had a taxi driver's license (Since the license acquisition process is different in Costa Rica, with different categories divided if you're driving either a bike, a car, a public transportation vehicle or a heavy construction vehicle), since she said that she had I agreed to take the cab instead of the regular car.\n\n \n \nSo here we were, crossing the mountain in order to get to the city where that client is, and since that route is also used by some drug dealers to move their product on the ground there are checkpoints with traffic police and regular police along the mountain, we arrive at the first point, we get pulled over.... And she goes pale.\n\n \n \nHer: **Fuck**!\n \n \nMe: What's wrong?\n \n \nHer: My cab license expired.\n \n \nMe: When? \n \n \nHer: Six months ago.\n \n \nMe: Why didn't you tell me? \n \n \nHer: I wasn't expecting that I had to drive a cab!\n \n \nMe: Okay, fair point. Just stay calm.\n \n \nAt this point the checking officer got to where she was and began to speak with her.\n \n \nOfficer: License and registration please.\n \n \nHer: Okay, here you go.\n \n \nWith this he began to walk away in order to check if everything was okay. And after 5 minutes he came back along with the Traffic Officer.\n \n \nTraffic Officer: Okay Ma'am, I see that your Public Transport vehicle license expired 6 months ago, and the bi annual car checkup was done more than 6 months ago, therefore I'm sorry but I'll have to write you two tickets, do you understand?\n \n \nHer: If I say no, will you let me go? \n \n \nTraffic Officer after laughing: No, unfortunately I cannot do that.\n \n \nHer: Oh well, had to try.\n\n \n \nAfter that we were on our merry way, after agreeing that I'd pay the tickets since it was my idea to take this car instead of the usual one. After that everything was okay.... \n\n \n \n....Until we got pulled over at the second checkpoint.\n\n \n \nSecond Officer: License and registration please.\n \n \nHer: Okay, here you go, but sir...\n \n \nSecond Officer: Alright, wait here, I'll be right back.\n\n \n \nAnd as expected, he left and came back 10 minutes along with the traffic officer:\n \n \nSecond Traffic Officer: Okay Ma'am, I see that your Public Transport vehicle license expired 6 months ago, and the bi annual car checkup was done more than 6 months ago, therefore I'm sorry but I'll have to write you two tickets, do you understand?\n \n \nHer: But I already got a ticket\n \n \nSecond Traffic Officer: What? \n \n \nHer: Yeah, it was issued today and everything.\n \n \nSecond Traffic Officer: May I see it?\n \n \nHer: Sure, here it is.\n\n  \n\n \nSure enough, after seeing it he let us go, but warned us that if we were caught tomorrow there would be another ticket.\n \n  \nAfter that we ended up being stopped **again** at the third checkpoint.\n \n  \nThird Officer: License and registration please.\n  \n  \nHer: Okay, here you go, can you also call the Traffic Officer while you're checking?\n \n \nThird officer: Alright.\n \n \nWith that he walked off and told the traffic officer to come to where we were\n \n \nThird Traffic Officer: Yes Ma'am, how can I help you?\n \n \nHer: Alright, look, in a moment your partner will come and tell you that I have an expired license and that the bi annual car checkup was done more than 6 months ago. Problem is that I already got a ticket, and was stopped twice before this time, here's the ticket.\n \n \n \nWith that she gave the ticket to him, and when he checked it the Regular Officer came back.\n \n \nThird Officer: Hey man, they have...\n \n \nThird Traffic Officer, cutting off the officer: An expired license and the checkup out of date?\n \n \nThird officer: How did you know? \n \n \nThird Traffic officer: Because apparently we're the third checkpoint that stopped them and asked them about it.\n \n \nThird officer: That sucks, so they already have a ticket? \n \n \nThird Traffic officer: Yup, so we gotta let them go.\n\n \n \nAnd with that they let us go, and thankfully there were no more checkpoints. For the return trip what we did was getting up at 3:30 AM and return at that time when there was low activity of officers.\n\n \n \nTL;DR: Did a favour to my grandma and ended up paying two tickets and being stopped by three different checkpoints.",

At the moment, we're on foot walking around the bar district, checking for any problems.\n\nOfficer decides he wants to grab some chicken strips from the only restaurant open in the area, which is also a drunk resort.

        "text": "So I figured this one might get a chuckle or two. Working security at my last college, pretty boring Thursday night thus far. Scared some high schoolers off the baseball field, chatted with the maintenance crew, usual shit. \n\nI carried the security hotline phone that people would call to get ahold of the campus safety dept. Most would just call 911 if there was an actual emergency, which is why I carried a radio, but it was policy so there I was.\n\nI had just finished going through the dorms when the phone rang around 2300. Local dispatch had been quiet, so I was hoping this would just be a minor noise complaint, or maybe someone's pipes had burst considering it was mid-january in the midwest, also known as Fucking Cold. \n\n\"Campus Security, this is Seatown93.\"\n\nRP: \"Hey, this is so-and-so in the east apartments. I think someone is smoking weed in the apartment next to mine and it's really messing with my asthma. Normally I wouldn't care but...\"\n\n\"No problem, I understand. I'll be up there in just a few minutes, thanks for the call.\"\n\nHanging up, I start heading towards the apartment in question and get on the horn with the local PD. While I would've loved to have just dealt with this myself, our policy stated that in any incident where criminal charges might occur, we had to have an officer on scene. Clearly dispatch isn't excited about sending someone out for a kid smoking a joint, but they oblige me and send out an officer.\n\nThankfully it's a guy I know, let's call him Ofc M. He's got the sickest sense of humor I've ever run across, but I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have backing me up. We roll up to the apartment and knock on the front door, announcing ourselves. \n\nWe hear some footsteps and muttered cursing, and a couple seconds later the door opens. And just like Cheech and Chong, smoke comes billowing out of the room like it's on fire. I almost get knocked on my ass by the smell. The guy standing there is wearing nothing but sweatpants, eyes looking like he dropped red food coloring in them. He sees us and it takes a second to register, but when it does they go wide and he just mutters \"shit\" under his breath. I actually knew this guy considering it was a small campus, who for the sake of privacy I'll call Ben. \n\nOfc M: \"Evening buddy, how's it going?\"\n\nBen: \"Shit...you guys are cops...\"\n\nI point to M. \"He is, I'm not. Mind if we come in?\"\n\nBen: \"Umm...kay.\"\n\nWe let the smoke clear out and it's obvious he wasn't thinking enough to hide his glass pipe and little bag of weed on the kitchen table. He had also forgotten to sign out of his COD game and was getting totally slaughtered, poor bastard. \n\nMe: \"Soooo, I'm gonna take a shot in the dark here and assume you know why we're here.\"\n\nBen just droops his shoulders and sits down in a chair looking like his dog just died. \"Yeahhh...it's the weed huh?\"\n\nMe: \"Mmmmyup. Is that all you have?\" I point to the bag on the kitchen. He nods. \n\nOfc M: \"How long've you been smoking dude? Foggy as shit in here!\"\n\nBen: \"Uhhh...like...an hour?\"\n\nThat seemed to make sense, since there was still residue in the pipe and the ziploc barely had any left in it. I take a quick look around for anything else and didn't find anything while Ofc M was still chatting with Ben and checking him for warrants. After a couple minutes I come back and give him the 'all good' sign. \n\nOfc M: \"Okay Ben, here's the deal. You're not wanted for anything and don't have anything serious on your record. So how about I write you a citation for possession of paraphernalia, you agree to show up in court and stop smoking dope in your apartment, and I let you get back to your game.\" He looks over at the TV. \"Because holy shit, you're getting killed dude.\"\n\nBen: \"Wait...I'm not gonna go to jail?\" I've never seen someone look so surprised in my life.\n\nOfc M: \"As long as I don't have to come back out here again tonight, nope.\"\n\nBen: \"Really? Awesome! Thanks dude...I mean, sir..officer.\" \n\nOfc M: \"Don't mention it. Now here's the ticket, just sign there at the bottom and I'm gonna take this bag for evidence. That good with you?\"\n\nBen: \"Yeah yeah, no prob. Can, uh...can I keep my bong?\"\n\nI have to stop myself from laughing out loud at this point. M just chuckles and shakes his head. \"Sorry man, it's evidence.\"\n\nBen: \"Seriously? It was like fifty bucks...\"\n\nOfc M: \"You paid fifty bucks for that thing? Dude, there's this thing called Amazon. Look it up.\" \n\nIn the end Ben let us take the pipe and went back to playing COD. Later that week he actually thanked me, saying that we were both pretty cool about the whole situation. I had also put in my report that he was cooperative and cordial, so that probably helped him from getting kicked out of school, which may have had something to do with it. \n\nProbably not the most exciting story I know, but it came to mind reading some of the ones here.

        "text": "Background: I went to a little community college two years back that had an paid internship program for criminal justice students such as myself. Essentially it was just a security guard position. I applied and got accepted, elected to work weekend nights from 2100-0600 (yes, I'm an idiot.) The school also contracted out to the local PD to have an officer up there from 1800 to around 0200. \n\nI worked with some great officers during my two years there. One of them, while he was a fantastic guy and I loved hanging out with him, was apparently cursed. EVERY night he worked something strange/awful/hilarious would happen. And it just so happened he always worked fridays. We'll call him \"Sgt. B\"\n\nSo I roll into the office that night to get my gear and he's there already. We start bullshitting as usual. I go on my rounds and keep an ear on the radio. \n\nWe made it till 0100 until the first call came in (it was a pretty sleepy campus). Thankfully it was actually a good one. Someone heard meowing coming from under a storage shed and we went to check it out. Just a little kitten and momma wasn't around. We got her out and \"dawwwwed\" for a bit before animal control took her.*\n\nSo that's done. We're back in the office just hanging out. 0150, ten minutes before he's supposed to leave, Sgt. B starts getting his stuff to go home and he jokes about the cat being the most exciting thing he's dealt with that day. THAT'S when the radio goes off. Shit.\n\n\"Unit 19, dispatch.\"\n\n\"Dispatch, 19. Go ahead.\"\n\n\"Reports of...umm...reports of a horse loose on campus near the arts center...with a...a...naked man riding it...\"\n\nPause. \"Roger that, we'll check it out.\"\n\nI'm trying to figure out if I should laugh or cry at this point, and Sgt. B looks like he's about to do the latter. Hop in his car and drive the 500 yards over towards the parking lot of the arts building. Suuuure enough, there's a horse. With a guy on top of it. With no clothes. Balls and ass flapping in the wind uggghhhhh.\n\nHe's just prancing around in circles and the horse doesn't seem too bothered despite the guy singing loudly, and terribly I might add, Bohemian Rhapsody. I'm just flabbergasted at this point and the Sgt looks about the same. But we approach and start chatting with the guy who's clearly lost his marbles. We didn't smell any alcohol, and after a few minutes managed to get him to climb down where he just stands there, hugging this poor horse like it's a life buoy in a sea of his insanity. \n\nIt takes us damn near fifteen minutes to get a name out of him, since apparently he didn't think to stick his ID up his asscrack before leaving home. At some point another officer shows up but has to stay in his car for a minute because he's laughing so hard. \n\nTurns out the guy was supposed to be on meds for some psych condition but hadn't taken them, and also ran a boarding home for horses. He wasn't acting violent or /too/ unstable, so we made the call to just have his wife take him home for the night and get the horse back to the barn. Guy gets a ride home (after giving him a pair of pants), horse gets loaded up into a trailer and that's that. \n\nSgt. B and I get back in his car, by now it's almost 0400 and he's hating life. \n\nSgt B: \"I've got to be up at seven for day shift, what the fuck.\"\n\nMe: \"Dude, you're cursed, I swear to god. Did you piss off a gypsy or something?\"\n\nSgt B: \"I ain't ever arrested one, so I don't think so. But holy shit this is getting stupid.\"\n\nMe: \"Y'know what, your new name is Officer Shitmagnet.\"\n\nSgt B: \"...I won't even argue with that.\"\n\n*Said kitty was actually adopted by Sgt B a week later. We're hoping it's somehow turned his god-awful luck around but I seriously doubt it. \n\nHope ya'll enjoyed! ",

        "text": "Generally speaking, calls involving EDPs (emotionally disturbed people) entail somewhat higher risk than other situations.  Domestic Violence calls are also some of the most dangerous calls to go to due, in part, to emotionally charged circumstances.  I went to a call once that combined the two factors.  It was a little dicy, but not really that scary.  I apologize in advance for the fact that this comment doesn't really answer the question, but I think folks will enjoy this story nonetheless.\n\nIt's true that often time police officers will see the unsightly side of things.  Folks tend to call 9-1-1 when their world is falling apart, and sometimes it's not pretty.  I felt bad for this poor old lady.  Her husband, whom she loved dearly, was bedridden; his list of ailments were lengthy.  Having trouble caring for him by herself, she would hire caretakers to tend to his needs.  They often only lasted a few months, because of the old lady's adult daughter who also lived in the house.  The daughter, who was in her 40s at the time of this particular call, had a history of mental illness and would sometimes refuse to take her medication.  This would result in violent mood swings, and she would often take take her anger out on her elderly mother and the caretakers.  In an unrelated matter, she was quite corpulent, probably weighing in at over 300 lbs.  \n\nA 9-1-1 call comes in.  It was the caretaker who had called, stating that the daughter had struck her mother during a heated verbal argument.  My partner and I arrive to the scene.  We walk into a house cluttered with stacks of old newspapers and other garbage/recycling.  It's unclear who the hoarder was, but it was difficult to move about the interior.  The daughter is in her room, which is only half a flight upstairs.  She is screaming at the top of her lungs for us to go away.  She is also hollering racial epithets to the caretaker \"who started it all.\"  The mother was unraveled.  The years of stress of her husband's poor health and her daughter's issues had taken their toll on her.  She denied that anything had happened.  The fresh bruise on her face below her eye told a different story.  It became clear that we were going to arrest the daughter for assault.\n\nThis was in late spring.  We were wearing long sleeves, I remember it well.  We walked upstairs into the daughter's room, which was more cluttered than the rest of the house.   It smelled of garbage and feculence.  The heat was turned all the way up; she always thought she was sick when she actually wasn't.  She lay on the bed, still screaming wildly at us.  She wore only a button down shirt.  It was entirely too small for her.  She glistened with greasy sweat.\n\nWe tried to talk to her and calm her down, but it was to no avail.  She shrilled so loud that my ears began to ring.  As she wailed, I gave my partner a nod and counted to three.  That's when the fight was on.  She flailed and scratched and hollered.  We tripped over the clutter and she slipped out of our grasp.  Now the mother was getting involved, screaming at us not to arrest her daughter.  She eventually used her dead weight to her advantage by just laying there as we attempted to handcuff her.  We needed two pair, but eventually we got her into the restraints.  We had called for an ambulance for commitment to the hospital for psychological evaluation.  It took six of us to carry her out of the house.  Once outside, steam rose from our bodies in the cool weather.  Because I was the most junior officer, I was designated to ride in the ambulance with her during transport.\n\nI had a very strong drink when I got home from work that night.",

        "text": "My first week out of the academy and I am in the FTO (Field Training Phase). My FTO has 15 plus years of experience in a major city. We are talking and getting to know each other, my FTO has three kids and a new born baby, his own martial arts dojo, and too many details. We are night watch and he is catching up on sleep as I catch up on my reports. \n\nMy FTO wakes up and says lets do a quick business check, we head over to a breakfast place that opens up at 5:00 AM, the place has decent coffee and pretty good donuts, I know it's cliche but donuts are awesome. If you don't like donuts, stop hating my America. \n\nBEEP, unit -30: we have a car refusing to stop, heading east on the highway.\n\nI look at my FTO, he has a smile on his face, \"Good thing the Lieutenant is off tonight we might have the go ahead.\" \n\nDispatch: State Troopers are requesting assistance of [REDACTED] for pursuit. \n\nMy sergeant comes over the air units.\"333, 301, and 399 get up there and help them. \n\nMy FTO looks at me and says, \"GET TO THE INTERSTATE!\" So I put our vehicle in drive and start accelerating down the road to the interstate. My FTO is wide awake and listening to the radio. The suspect is heading towards our district at a high rate of speed, around 100 MPH in a P/U. \n\nThe State Troopers have a bit more leeway than my department for chases and have a suspect on a switched plate, the suspect is flying down the interstate at 5:00 AM in the morning, right before that 6:00 AM morning commute. The suspect is flying towards my district and my FTO says relax and wait. We are listening and seeing if the vehicle is going to get off at our exit or keep flying down the interstate. \n\nUnit -30: He's going west bound at [REDACTED] just past exit...\n\nMy FTO says, \"Get up on the interstate and stay behind the lead guys.\" I look at my FTO and smile. I'm smiling because during my academy, the instructors stated. any car chase would be stopped by rank right away. We don't chase anymore. \n\nLights and sirens screaming over ahead as I turn the engine over and have my vehicle flying up the on ramp. I'm on my first car chase and I'm on day 5 out of the academy and my second day driving. Incredible feeling as I weave in and out of the light traffic in the morning. \n\nThe State Troopers are ahead and have four vehicles on the suspects vehicle. I see there distant blue lights in the distance about a 1/2 mile away. \n\nI began closing the gap as we chase the suspect east bound on the highway. I look at my FTO and ask him if he's heading towards one of the projects and my FTO says maybe or he could be looking to bail. The suspect gets off at the next intersection only to get right back on the interstate heading WEST bound! We follow the State Troopers and begin speeding away from my district and towards downtown. The suspect gets off at downtown exit looking to bail but doesn't find a suitable spot and gets back on the interstate towards my district of responsibility. The radio is chirping away as my FTO very calmly gives out locations updates to my Sergeant. \n \nThe suspect has been driving around the interstate and city for about 30 minutes. The suspect had very bad timing as all of the State Troopers of night watch are about to get off so the day watch has arrived. Now the suspect has night and day watch from the State troopers following him along with the units of my district and other units from other district's. \n\nThe suspect heads back towards my district and gets off in one of the more quieter area's in my district. The State Troopers are paralleling the streets and laying out spike strips. The front passenger tire takes some spikes and the car is loosing traction. \n\nThe State Troopers box in the car. I'm right on scene as the Troopers pull out there AR's and have the suspect come out of the vehicle and place the suspect on the ground and begin handcuffing. \n\nMy first car chase and my adrenaline has been spiking. I love this job and can't wait for the next car chase. My FTO looks at me and says good job, you did everything right, now lets head home and clock out. ",

        "text": "I was referred here from P&amp;S by a few readers who thought I should share a post there...\n\nThe Tyranny of Feeling\n\n“That’s the problem with police, you don’t show enough feeling” she said. “You don’t feel enough.” She’s right of course.\n\nA drowning in a desert town with no lakes. My partner jumped into the canal and pushed the huge man to the bank. I struggled and pulled, he pushed and slipped, both of us wet and covered with mud, neither of feeling the cold water. Our new officer arrived, and jumped into the scene, pushing on the man’s chest while I hovered over his face, trying to see inside his mouth. His wife, hands on my shoulders, screaming in my ear, screaming no. I couldn’t feel her breath on my neck, her tears on my head. Finally, my partner says to stop, just stop. I looked down and saw my pants were covered in the man’s blood, which had poured from the bullet hole in his temple. I couldn’t feel the wet blood soaking through my pants. She’s right of course, I couldn’t “feel enough.”\n\nA gunshot in the basement of a home. As I made my way down the stairs, the air was filled with a haze. A man, missing his face, and a rifle sitting in a lake of blood on the bed. Three walls covered with meat. The mewling, writhing figure unable to speak, but clearly letting me know the horror, the pain, he was feeling. A few inches of jaw, glued to the carpet, the stubble of beard visible from the inside. The home now filled with explosive gas, a mother unaware. A mother begging us to just let her son die. As I grabbed the woman by the arm, I couldn’t feel her brittle, old bones under my grip. I couldn’t smell the gas, couldn’t gag as I pulled the jaw from the carpet; I couldn’t find it inside me to feel the horror. She’s right of course, I couldn’t “feel enough.”\n\nA mother, worn by the chemotherapy, held hostage. A son, a mind broken by drugs and now holding mom hostage until a girlfriend returns. I can’t feel the gun in my hands. A plan develops, a promise of a drink for a thirsty mother, worn by the long negotiation. A foot through the door, a son brings the knife towards my partner. I can’t feel my friend get cut. I can’t feel my gun, screwed into the temple of a man who’s so close to having a mind broken by a bullet. “I’ve got the knife,” the officer behind me yells. I can’t feel the relief. She’s right of course, I couldn’t “feel enough.”\n\nA breathing problem, a medical call, leave it for the medics. But I’m here, and this lady isn’t breathing, won’t breathe again. I can’t feel her granddaughter behind me, watching me place shock pads on grandma’s chest, watching me push helplessly on grandma as the machine tells me to push harder. Later now, the medics gone. As her husband pulls me into a hug, I can’t feel his heart breaking inside. Her husband has to say goodbye, and I go to her first. I never knew her, but she wouldn’t want to be seen like this, not for a goodbye. I pull a breathing tube from her throat, I can’t feel the bulb catch on her teeth, her stiffening jaw fighting this release. I pull on the bone needles screwed into her shins, I can’t feel how the diabetes has scarred her lower legs. I wipe the blood from her nose and mouth, I can’t feel how cold the blood already is. She’s right of course, I couldn’t “feel enough.”\n\nA naked monster, celebrating his first day outside of prison with a cocktail of street drugs and liquor, kicking in the door. A boy, just eight, standing behind the door, holding a bat to protect his four-year-old sister from the monster outside. I can’t feel their panic, I don’t know they stand just feet from where the monster and I fight. I can’t feel his fingernails, carving deep and bloody into my arm. I can’t feel the burning as sweat, blood, and mace spray mix into the bloody cuts. He can’t feel the pain, he’s well beyond feeling. As he breaks the porch, breaks the door, breaks my skin, breaks the quiet peace of the neighborhood, I can’t feel his hair in both my hands, pulling him back from the sidewalk where he slams his head. Even today, I can’t feel those five long scars on my arm. She’s right of course, I couldn’t “feel enough.”\n\nA stolen car, a property crime. A man, too much time inside bars, reaching for the gun wrapped in a white t-shirt, cleaner than any of his other clothing. I can’t feel his hands around my waist as we fight, as we drag him from the car. I can’t feel the cars driving by us as I punch. His girlfriend screams, but I can’t feel her fear. As I continue to punch, five, six, seven hits, why won’t he stop? My wrist breaks, but I can’t feel that right now. “I’ll give you this,” he says later as we laugh together, “you boys know how to get down. I ain’t never been punched like that.” I can’t feel this admiration, can’t feel how sometimes the only one who understands is the guy you have to fight on the other side of the game. Months later, putting together another Lego set for my son. He can’t feel the bone inside my wrist give too much, the sharp pain that makes me gasp. I can’t feel the wrist, the back, the shoulder that has given too much. She’s right of course, I couldn’t “feel enough.”\n\nAnother friend, another loss. Years ago now he pulled that girl out of the cold creek, did he feel how her six-year-old body was too heavy, too water soaked? She was the same age as his daughter; his daughter the same age as mine. His daughter’s hand-made cards alongside my daughter’s on the fridge. He’d felt enough; he must’ve had enough.",

        "text": "I inwardly glowed as I contemplated the opportunity to fire off some snark in the comment thread I was browsing. I knew that being my first day back from holiday break I should probably be spending more time catching up on ignored emails and delinquent case files but the internet beckoned and I felt a little time to ease back in to the grind was in order. Besides, not every day offers up the chance to jab some shrimp on a cop forum who makes a routine of accusing you of dragging hoses around for a living.\n\nI pondered the several replies that first entered my head and typed a few down before settling on the one that seemed to best fit my mood. After plucking the submit button, I leaned back in my squeaky office chair, satisfied with my morning effort. The incoming email notification faded in on the bottom of the monitor. I saw the sender and sighed – Ted was notorious for leading day long wild goose hunts, depending on sheer numbers and show of force to flush out fugitives in place of in-depth detective work.\n\nI heard a sigh drifting from the cubicle next to mine. Apparently Kevin was experiencing the same reaction to the email as me.\n\n“You going?” I asked the air in his general direction.\n\nKevin stood and peered over our shared sound dampening wall of corporate privacy. “No chance. I’m so backed up on work it’s not even funny. You?”\n\nI sighed. “I’m swamped too but I think I’ll go.”\n\n“Have fun.” Kevin sunk back to his desk and I made my way to my cruiser.\n\nI hadn’t even read the body of the email, nor did I intend to when I opened it once I was in the driver’s seat. I clicked the hyperlinked address and made my way to the briefing location.\n\nWhile en route, plans changed. Ted came across the radio and informed all of us who were coming that a tipster had seen his target sleeping at his father’s house. Apparently, he had done an all-nighter, slinging dope and had plans to sleep the day away. We were to forego a formal briefing and get suited up prior to arriving, announcing our chosen perimeter spots over coms once we were settled in and ready to go. I oriented myself with the neighborhood and picked out a nice juicy parking spot with a clear view of the back of the target’s townhouse. I perused the email and took note of the case – photo of the bad guy, long criminal history, active warrant for an armed robbery and suspect in a dozen more. Pretty standard.\n\nAbout an hour later and the call came to start moving in. We had monitored the comings and goings of various family members from the house, confirming the house to be our target’s first party residence. I got out of my car and met up with a second teammate to cover the rear.\n\nAfter some pounding on the door and elevated voices clear even from the backyard, a squawk on the radio requested more guys inside. I glanced at my teammate who nodded for me to go ahead inside. One across the threshold, I understood what all the yelling was about: two girls in their early twenties were being held against a wall, obscenities flowing from their mouths like water from some Grecian water garden sculpture. The target’s father was talking with Ted.\n\n“Go ahead, look for him. I don’t think he’s here but please, don’t arrest my daughter. She didn’t know I let you in when she hit you.”\n\n“Bitch! I’ma own all y’all!” The daughter screamed over her shoulder. Brent cinched up on her cuffed wrists a bit.\n“Kick me one more time and I swear you’ll be eating jail food until next Christmas.” He growled at her.\nTed had the dad sit down then asked the rest of us to start the search. I assisted with the basement, noting copious amounts of drug related paraphernalia, but no bad guy. I filed in line with the remaining team members and we cautiously made our way upstairs, ballistic shield leading the way in case our target had thoughts of going out guns a’blazing.\n\nUpstairs was more of the same – weed, bongs, pipes. I entered a room and was surprised by two kids sitting on the bottom bunk of a wobbly Ikea bunk bed. Brent had left his charge to assist in the sweep and took the younger of the two, making introductions in baby voices to prevent them from crying. The second, maybe two years old, flashed me a smile and followed Brent and his brother dutifully. An ash tray overflowing with blunt guts and weed stems and seeds was prominent amongst the toys littering the floor. A TV was on the ground and a session of Call of Duty was paused. “He was in here recently.” I called out to the hall.\n\n“Attic!” came back a reply. I entered the father’s room and looked into the closet where a few guys had gathered, guns trained on the small hatch granting access to the attic. Insulation littered the floor and the molding around the two foot by two foot opening had been pulled free. Clearly our guy had shimmied his way up.\n\n“Make sure we still have good exterior perimeter on this row.” I said over the radio mic on my shoulder. “Target’s in the attic but some of these town homes have gaps in the fire walls up top.” I’d been burnt but that mistake before.\nWe were silent for a bit, listening for the telltale shuffling of our guy to clue us in on where he was lying in wait.\n“Who’s going to be the guy to put his foot through the ceiling?” I asked Matt in a hushed tone.\n“Not me. I’ll let you guys do the heavy work.”\n\nMike called up to the hole. “Jimmy. It’s the police. Come down now with your hands up, man. Let’s not stretch this thing out all day.” He then turned to another team member and tossed his keys. “Go grab my collapsing ladder from my truck. And the throw-bot and FLIR if they’re charged.” We had access to lots of fun toys to aid in this exact scenario.\n\nBrent returned from babysitter duty and pulled out a knife from his vest. “Think I should just start poking?” He grinned.\n\n“Jimmy! We’re going to send up the dog!” Mike yelled. I tried my best imitation of a German shepherd but doubt it was very convincing. We had nothing to do but wait for our gear and crack jokes until we had a better option.\n\nFinally, the ladder and FLIR showed up, but no throw-bot – it hadn’t been plugged in to the charger. Typical. We expanded the ladder to the attic entry and pushed it up with a baton before shoving the FLIR in to the void to see if there were any heat signatures. The colorful screen showed lots of hot spots, but nothing that looked particularly human-shaped. “I think we’re going to have to just hit it.” Mike conceded. The ballistic shield wouldn’t fit so we’d be going in rather unprotected. Thus is life sometimes.\n\nMike led the way, followed closely by two more. I hesitated, thinking three should be enough but ready to climb up quickly if they needed more.\n\n“He’d be back there if there was a break in the firewall.” Mike whispered.\n\n“Nothing.” One of the guys responded a moment later. I shot a confused look to Brent who shrugged his shoulders back.\n\n“Well, I guess we’ll need to check… SHOW ME YOR HANDS!” Mike erupted.\n\nAll three began issuing commands over each other and I vaulted up the ladder to assist. Inside, I saw the three lined up next to each other, the tight space offering little by way of cover or concealment. Their guns were all trained on a patch of white, fluffy, blown-in insulation between to rafters by the eave of the roof.\n\nI glanced at my footing and the path around the trio to get a better angle with my Taser. The insulation was clearly new and had been pumped up over the boards serving as a floor and running the length of the attic. “I got less lethal!” I announced as I darted around the group, flicking the safety to “fire” with my thumb and training my laser on the figure that suddenly sat up.\n\nJimmy shook his hair, flinging snowy bits of insulation from his dreads, but made no move to give up. “HANDS!” Mike ordered. I shifted a little more to my right, extending my arm around a beam and getting closer to my target.\nThere was a dull cracking sound, then my head filled with the white-noised woosh of flowing air past my head. “I’m falling.” I thought to myself.\n\nI’m positive the fall took less than a second to complete, but it’s amazing how much your brain can shove into such a short period. I contemplated a moment about how I was going to be “That Guy,” the one who went through the ceiling. Then I thought how it was interesting my first thought was that of embarrassment. My next thought was, “Why is this taking so long?” It seemed like I was more than the standard eight feet from the floor below.\nA hard landing, the feeling of toppling backwards, then the sensation of my head and shoulders cracking through another sheet of drywall followed. “That sucked.” I thought.\n\nFrom behind me, a woman began shrieking. A man’s voice began proclaiming, “Oh lord, oh lord!” Over and over. I stood as quickly as I could and stepped into the living room on the first floor. I was confused so I looked up to where I had come from: there was a man-sized hole in the ceiling and the chandelier was still rocking back and forth after its brush with disaster. Insulation drifted down like a pleasant snow flurry, settling in a tranquil blanket of heat efficiency on the stair landing two stories below. My head was ringing, the shrieking was intensifying behind me, making matters even worse. “SHUT UP!!” I yelled in the direction it was coming from.\n\n“Bro, bro. You ok?” Someone asked me.\n\n“Yeah.” I spit some insulation out of my mouth.\n\n“That ain’t Jimmy! It’s a fuckin’ cop!” The girl’s shrieking turned to laughter. “How da fuck does that even happen?”\n\n“Shut up Janette!” The dad warned.\n\nI was ushered outside the house, limping to the front stoop. Angry voices were making threats of jail or worse behind me but I just shook my head trying to stop the ringing. Brent was suddenly beside me. “Ambulance is on the way. What hurts?” He’s a tactical EMT.\n\n“I think I just sprained my ankle, man. I’m an idiot.”\n\n“Well, your nose is bleeding pretty bad, and you haven’t answered any of my questions until just now. I think there’s a little more than just an ankle.”\n\nI was confused. “You were asking my stuff?”\n\n“Yeah, and you were just looking around, until you yelled at that girl to shut up at least.”\n\n“She’s frigging annoying.”\n\n“Agreed. Just try not to move a lot.”\n\nI could hear the sirens in the distance. “I’ll be ok. Just my stupid ankle. God, I’m an idiot.”\n\n“We’ll let the medics take a look, cool?”\n\n“Whatever…”\n\nI was loaded into the ambulance and began answering questions about my medical history. Brent took another EMT to show him the scene of the accident. He came back a minute later.\n\n“You said you fell. You didn’t say it was two floors and onto the stairs.”\n\n“Symantics.” I mumbled, trying to shrug out of my vest and duty belt. Once that task was complete, I passed them to Brent.\n\n“You guys are taking him, right?” He asked the EMT.\n\n“Oh yeah.”\n\nI leaned back onto the gurney and sighed.\n \n_____________________\n\nA few hours later I was being wheeled out of the ER by Brandon. He had showed up along with a few other buddies and half the guys from my team. Mostly, my stay had been consumed by cracking jokes and fielding questions in order to start the workers comp claim. I assured everyone I’d be ok and caught a ride home.\n\nAs far as injuries, I somehow escaped with barely anything. I still need to see some doctors for the final prognosis, but as of today, I looking at ligament damage in one of my ankles, a stitch in my face where something jabbed me, a bruise on my kidney that’s no big deal, bruised ribs, and an assortment of purple and green patches where I pin-balled off who knows what.\n\nThe outpouring of support for such an amateur mistake on my part has been amazing. My mom quipped, “It’s called a landing but that’s not where you’re supposed to land.” My chief compared me to Clark Griswold from Christmas Vacation. Random emails and texts keep pouring in and I just want to crawl away and make everyone forget. I guess I’m lucky that the most damage done in the end was to my ego.",

        "text": "When I was a poor(er) girl in her early twenties I wasn't really good at paying my vehicle registration on time. After all, $75, that's groceries, that's phone bill, that's any number of other things that were necessary. Vehicle registration kept falling by the way side.... for five months.\n\nOne evening I run to get dinner for me and my roommates and didn't make it a block before I see the lights in my rear view. I pull over and City Cop asked me if I knew why he pulled me over. I did. He writes me a ticket, saying five months is just too long to get a pass on and tells me to get it taken care of as soon as possible.\n\nWell ticket was for $85 or so, which was the same amount as registration with a late fee, and I wasn't about to pay that late, but I couldn't afford to do both from one check. So I had to wait for next check, which was a week and a half away.\n\nCome Monday the following week. I'm in my hometown on my way to my friend's house. I see the lights in mirror again and curse. I pull over again. Town Cop comes up to the window, takes my license, asks if I know why he pulled me over, I told him I did and had already been ticketed for the offense and was just waiting on my paycheck so I could take care of the registration. He was really nice about it, handed me my ID back and said he wasn't about to give me another ticket, told me about all the ways I could renew the registration and sent me on my way.\n\nTwo days later, I'm driving into my hometown again. I see a Trooper going the other way. In my rear view mirror I see him do a u-turn and know it's for me. I pulled off the highway onto a residential street and pulled over and waited for him. He hadn't even hit his lights yet and he pulls up behind me, then starts flashing his lights.\n\nI explain the situation to Trooper, and that I've already been pulled over twice and I just had to wait two more days before I'd get paid so I could get it done. I even showed him the ticket I had just gotten the week before.\n\nHe doesn't really seem to care what I say. And when he asks for my proof of insurance, I can't find it. I'd just gotten new cards and wasn't sure what I'd done with them.\n\nHe ended up giving me fix it tickets (I think that's what they're called) for both those offenses and I had to present proof that I had insurance and renew my registration within the next five days or I'd have more fines. The annoying part was I found my insurance cards when I got home, they'd been in my bag in the back seat the whole time.\n\nI'd already planned on taking care of the registration right away, but I guess the threat of paying another fine is one way to make damn sure it gets done.\n\n",

        "text": "Halloween. 2009. Names have been changed to protect the guilty.\n\nI was an awkward 19 year old girl still living with her parents while attending a local technical college. My friend, Bob, had just started his first year at a liberal arts college a few hours away. He invited me to come and party with him for Halloween. Living with the 'rents, I hadn't had the real college experience, so I quickly accepted the offer.\n\nMy parents knew that I was pretty responsible, as far as 19 year olds go, and would buy me alcohol. But there was a rule; no driving afterwards. If I ever broke the rule, they'd take away my car. I never broke the rule. I was a generally well behaved kid, I didn't break many rules.\n\nSo I headed out to see my friend. In tow, I had another friend, Ben, who was 17 and had just started his senior year of high school. An awkward shy kid like me, we were excited to go hang out on campus. We had a trunk full of beer and no parental supervision. It was going to be a fun Halloween.\n\nSo we get to campus and meet up with Bob and his friend Bart. Bart was from our little home town too. I knew his face and his name, but hadn't really talked to him before. Bob was experiencing freedom from his very religious parents for the first time. He'd been home-schooled all his life, and now that he was free he'd gone sort of wild. He told me stories of the drugs he'd tried and how he was banned from the local liquor store for shoplifting. He left me shaking my head about how stupid he was.\n\nSo Bob and Bart don't have costumes yet and Bob's car is down for the count, so he asks me to drive them to the Halloween store. I say no problem, but I also want to get all the liquor out of my trunk. They whine, but eventually I get them to help me haul up the cooler and boxes.\n\nWhen we're back upstairs, Bart suggests we smoke a bowl, but I insist we wait until we come back. I'd only smoked a couple times before then, and wasn't comfortable with driving afterwards. Bart whines that I'm a buzz kill, I remind him not to fuck with the person who has the alcohol.\n\nSo we go to the Halloween store, they get costumes. I can't remember what Bart was, but Bob decided to be stoner Jesus... yeah. He asks me to stop at the CVS on the way back to the dorms so he can get cough medicine. He's got a cold and doesn't want it to hold him back, I say no problem. He comes out with a couple bottles of Robitussin. Me and Ben are in the front seats, Bob and Bart are in the back.\n\nIt was dark by the time we headed back to the dorms, and I was having trouble seeing the street signs. I was doing 35, thinking the speed limit was 30. It turns out the speed limit was actually 25...\n\nSo I see red and blue in my rearview. A chorus of \"oh fuck\" rings throughout the car. I think about the alcohol that wasn't in the trunk anymore. The weed we didn't smoke. I was so damn grateful.\n\nThe street we were on was a busy thoroughfare with no real shoulder. Pulling over there would have meant blocking traffic, so I turned on to a quiet residential street instead and pulled over there.\n\nI roll down my window and return my hands to the wheel.\n\nI see the flashlight bobbing up to the car and the officer greets us, shining the light in our eyes. He asks if I knew why he pulled me over, and I didn't. He tells me I was going 10 over. I was genuinely surprised. He takes all of our licenses and asks us if we're going to school there. Bob and Bart tell him they're students, Ben and I are just there to visit them.\n\nThe officer heads back to his car to runs our IDs and my vehicle registration. We wait nervously. Then Bob says this.\n\n&gt;So I just drank an entire bottle of Robitussin...\n\nGreat. So my friend is fucked up on cough syrup in the back seat of my car during a traffic stop. I asked him and Bart if they had anything illegal on them, they both told me all their shit was at the dorms. Then I see another squad car pull up. Wonderful.\n\nSo the officer comes back to my window and asks me to step out. I do as I'm told and he walks me to the back of my car. I glance in and see all three of them watching us. Officer 2 joins us.\n\n&gt;Officer- First I just want to let you know that I'm just going to give you a written warning for the speeding. You're from out of town, I get it, I just need you to pay more attention in the future, okay?\n\n&gt;Me- Yes, sir. Thank you.\n\nHe looks down at our IDs in his hand.\n\n&gt;Officer- Now, I'm a little concerned about your friend Bob. What's going on with him?\n\n&gt;Me- He has a cold, sir.\n\n&gt;Officer- Did he take anything for it?\n\n&gt;Me- He drank some cough syrup, sir.\n\n*Some*\n\n&gt;Officer- Okay, do you have anything illegal in your vehicle?\n\n*Not anymore*\n\n&gt;Me- No, sir.\n\n&gt;Officer- Would you be willing to let me search the vehicle?\n\nI knew that I could say no, but I also knew that I didn't have anything that could get me in trouble. I figured it would be faster to let them check the car rather than fight them on it and wait for a K-9 or something.\n\n&gt;Me- Yes, sir.\n\nSo they get my friends out of the car. They have us empty our pockets, but we don't have anything. Officer 1 stays with us while Officer 2 starts going through the car. It didn't take long, it was a tiny '96 Corolla. I felt bad when the officer got to the trunk and had to haul the heavy snow tires out to get a look inside.\n\nAs he's looking, I keep looking over at Bob, who looks the scaredest of the four of us. His eyes seem to be growing in size. When Officer 2 is going through the back seat, he picks up the empty Robitussin bottle and glances over at Bob and shakes his head. They knew.\n\nWhen officer 2 was done, they sent us on our way with nothing more than a \"be safe tonight, kids.\" As we pulled away, all four of us were pretty surprised that all that happened was we lost drinking time.\n\nOh, and Bob and Bart got a big **HA!** from me because I'm apparently a god damn psychic.",

        "text": "In which /u/homerunman once again does his best to take two otherwise routine and boring incidents and make them interesting.\n\nI hate seeing inactivity on the sub, plus I'm in the hospital again and I need something to do. These are both relatively short, so I've combined them so you can waste more of your shift at once, whether you're parked next to a 7-11, behind a QT or a Sheetz, or at your desk. You're welcome.\n**************\n**The Ticket**\n\nI finished inhaling my bagel and tossed my trash as I walked out of my breakfast stop. I was in town to take care of a few things related to my on-hold college education, but mostly that was an excuse to party for a few days and blow off some steam, which I badly needed to do. I was on my way back out of town, headed back towards the suburban hell I'd been staying in. I fished the keys out of my pocket, admired my parallel parking, and hopped into the truck. I eased out onto the road, past two (empty) campus Interceptors and made my way to the next red light.\n\nWhat followed next is up for discussion. According to the officer, I \"flew down the road, exhaust all blowing\" and hooked a left \"in an unsafe manner without signaling.\" The way I told my family was I left quicker than the guy on my right and that's all. The facts are this -\n\n\n* I did leave quicker than the guy next to me. I did not let the noisy 4.0L get out of second gear. I was probably &gt;5 over.\n\n* There are typically pedestrians all over the place on that section of street. I looked for them. I saw none.\n\n* I braked well in advance of my left, and got 3 blinkers ticks in before I hooked it. Was it quick? Yes. Out of control? No. It's urban driving, I was trying to not hold up traffic.\n\nI'm barely around the corner before I hear him bluelight me and hit the yelp. Shit. By now, I know the drill. Wave, windows down, blinker on. I'm looking for a safe space to pull over (shoutout to officer safety) when a rage-fueled cycle cop comes up to my window and shouts \"Over! Now!\"\n\n\"I'm trying not to double park, I don't want you guys to get hit!\" I called back.\n\n\"NO!!! OVER!! NOW!!\" Spittle flying from his lips, he then points out a space where I was intending on parking anyway. I grumble and slide my behemoth in while I fish out my license and reg. \n\n\"What do you think you're doing?!\" he shouted, putting down his kickstand.\n\n\"Trying to not get you guys run over?\" My smartass retort was more reflex than anything. I immediately regretted it.\n\nBikebro snorted as the other officer approached me. I did a double take because the guy straight up looked like [Michael Jace](http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Entertainment/gty_michael_jace_kb_140520_16x9_992.jpg) off [The Shield](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/theshield/images/9/93/Shield-season1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091028224834), I mean dead ringer.\n\nHe asked for and received my license and info, following up with \"Where you going in such a hurry?\" \n\n\"Just headed home. I was here visiting.\"\n\n\"Visiting?\"\n\nIt is at this point that I make the conscious decision to play the crying girl card. Now, I hate that move, it's a rotten thing to do, and I'll probably never do it again, but I can tell by this dude's body language that he's set on writing me a ticket, and if I can get out of it, I might as well try. Plus I have the ultimate trump card - cancer.\n\n\"Yeah, visiting.\" I slid my hat slyly off my then-bald head. \"I was gonna come back in the fall, but I found out about the cancer and I've been stuck back at home where my doctors are. I got a break from my chemo and I decided to come see my friends while I still can.\"\n\n\"Mmhm.\"\n\nI shot him a look. Dude, look! Bald head! My license says 140lb but I'm barely 125! My face is gaunt and pale! I obviously have cancer! Cut me a break!\n\n\"You went here?\" \n\n\"I did, and I'm coming back...if I can, y'know, survive treament.\" I'm totally gonna survive, but he doesn't know that.\n\n\"Right. Sit tight.\"\n\nAt this point Bikebro asks me if I drove or not while I was in the city. I told him I didn't drive when I was here as a student and I rode BMX, it was a good bike town.\n\n\"Didn't the crazy driving scare you, make you worried?\"\n\n\"No, not really. One close call, but it was my fault,\" I honestly answered. \"I've ridden bikes in a bunch of cities, this is easy. I can do traffic here all day.\" It was true - I'd been on bikes in a few cities on the East Coast, including DC which might be the most bike-unfriendly city (besides New York) in the world.\n\n\"That's no excuse to drive all crazy like that!\" he indignantly replied. \n\n\"I honestly didn't think it was that bad, but I'm not trying to hash it out right here,\" I said. \"If he wants to write the ticket, that's his call and I'll take it up in court.\" \n\nBikebro spit his dip juice on the sidewalk, and sauntered back to the Interceptor. I watched his helmeted head disappear into the passenger window, leaving me to stew and wait for my inevitable ticket. In a speedtrap state, pulled by maybe the one department in the state that was the most overt about having quotas, I knew I'd get something. I was just hoping the \"c-word\" bought me some slack.\n\nIt hadn't. Michael Jace came back with a clipboard. Damn. \n\n\"Here's your info back. This is a citation - reckless driving, general endangerment.\" Fuck my life. I could see the insurance price skyrocket.\n\n\"Man, big points, and class,\" I grumbled, taking the clipboard.\n\n\"Mandatory court, too,\" MJ added, pointing to my court date. \n\n\"But I live two hours from here!\" I weakly pleaded. I looked at the date itself. \"I can't even come! I have surgery on this day!\" I did in fact have a major surgery, scheduled months in advance, the day of my court. \"Look, I know you hear this all the time, but can you shred it and either write me for something else or at least give me a new court date?\"\n\nMJ shook his head. Bikebro stepped in - \"Should've thought about that before you got a case of leadfoot.\" Wow, fuck this guy, I though to myself. He's right, but he's being a cockend about it. I looked back to MJ with puppy dog eyes.\n\n\"Out of luck, sir. Sign there. Not an admission of guilt...\" I waved him off and signed.\n\n\"I know the drill, I'm supposed to show up. Look, can I at least call the court and move the date?\"\n\nHe thought about it. \"You can try, but they're pretty backlogged. I'd just come.\"\n\nI cursed repeatedly under my breath as he handed me my copy. \"I'll figure something out. Have a good one.\"\n\nHe held traffic for me to pull away, leaving him with Bikebro on the sidewalk.\n\nThe best part? After two continuations (one from the lawyer I hired, one from the court), the guy never even showed up to court. So surely, you think, /u/homerunman has a lucky day! His (criminal, I might add) charges will be dropped, because it's just a ticket after all, and MJ never bothered to come to court. Nope. In fact, since he didn't show, the DA couldn't talk with him, and wanted to feed me the whole charge as a result. Wow. Great. The case got continued AGAIN, which led to an interesting conversation a few months late with another officer. Speaking of which...\n**************\n**Oops, I Kept A Drug Dealer Out Of Jail**\n\nDisclaimer - before I begin, I realize some poor decisions were made in this story. \n\nI'm young and foolish. While I do my best to keep my nose clean and preserve my record for a career in LE, this doesn't preclude me from being young and foolish. I sometimes make poor decisions as a result. My friends are also young and foolish, but since they're all staring down the reality of a life of working retail, they give less of a shit about their decisions. This makes my life interesting at times.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was seeing a decent-sized group of old and current friends - my best buddy, college roommate, two guys I knew from high school that I'd kept in touch with, one of those guys' girlfriends, her friend (another girl of questionable sanity and more questionable moral/sexual history) and one other buddy I saw regularly. We were all having a wonderful evening, enjoying each others' company, catching up, eating pizza, and what have you. After some hours, the \"free spirits\" of the group decide to go to the local park. Being the white knight that I am, I offered vehicular assistance, so I loaded up my best friend, several more piled into the floozy's car, and the most moronic of the group walked there while the couple stayed behind. \n\nI arrived and nosed in to the other car we came with, where the girl was fussing with something in her car. I didn't pay attention, and carried on my conversation with my buddy. The idiots arrived on foot, and Harlot and Co. quickly followed behind. I stayed in the truck and finished listening to my song, loathe to get out into the cold winter air. I sadly relinquished the warmth of my heater and went to go find the knot of people, somewhere in the depths of the park. I'd figured they would set up a hookah, as was the norm for our little gang, and we'd continue sharing stories and talking about the universe. As I approached the motley crew, however, instead of smoldering shisha I was greeted with the punch of burning weed. Shit. Not what I need. I've never been about it, I don't want or need it, plus at that moment I really wanted chicken nuggets, my go-to late night food, so my mind was already kind of made up to begin with.\n\n\"Hey guys, it's late, plus you all know how I feel about this, so I think I'm out for the night.\"\n\nI was met with a chorus of \"All right,\" \"No problem\"'s, and assorted goodbyes. I fist bumped who I needed to and beat tracks to my warm truck fast as I could. It was cold, and I wanted no part in that. I silently thanked my friends for being so understanding - we both were respectful of where we stood on the issue, they didn't make me smoke, I didn't mom them about it, we're all adults, whatever. I hopped in and turned the truck over, eager for warmth. I fussed with my phone for a minute, picked out the right Wale track for the moment and dropped my junk into Drive, only to look up and see 2 pairs of Interceptor running lights pulling up through the dark. Well, shit, I thought to myself. This is where my friends all go to jail over some menial shit.\n\nI pretended to play with my phone a little more, wondering if either the officers would come talk to me first together, or ignore me completely, however unlikely the latter may be. Sure enough, a bobbing flashlight shone across my windshield, causing my hands to involuntarily pop up over the dash. The light came closer, shortly followed by the shape of the officer appearing out of the darkness. I hit the dome light and rolled the two front windows down.\n\n\"What can I do for ya?\" I queried the officer.\n\n\"Just an ID for now,\" he said. \"What's going on down here?\"\n\nI handed across my license. \"How do you mean,\" I said, playing dumb.\n\n\"Nothing crazy, just a neighbor called in and said there was a group of people down here, carrying on and using drugs. What do you know about that?\"\n\nOh, the people who I've known for like 5 years? Using drugs in a public place in the middle of the night? Why, I never! Trying not to be a snitch nor an obstructor, I heard my mouth say \"I mean, I came down here with some buddies, we were all just hanging out and wanted some air.\" Brilliant. Way to go, moron.\n\n\"Radio says there were like 15-20 teenagers?\" A second voice came out of the darkness. A shorter officer from the second car had made his way to the same window.\n\n\"No, no, like 6 or 8 people. No juveniles. One female, rest male.\" They both seemed taken aback at hearing just those few descriptors come out of a civilian mouth. I guess I'm full of surprises.\n\n\"Drugs?\" asked #2. Shit, now I'm really between the rock and the hard place. \n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, I head my mouth weakly say, \"Nothing that I know for sure, but I've been away from them for a little while, I guess....anything....possible...\" I trailed off, in disbelief of what I'd just said. I quickly added \"I'm not into that, though, and they all know it, so...who knows.\" The first guy nodded.\n\n\"I thought as much. I can't smell it, plus you seem alright. I'm just gonna run you real quick for warrants. Your car?\" The first officer was a big guy, maybe 6'5\", 220.\n\n\"Registered to my dad. Fair warning, I might have something open in NCIC, I'm not really sure what it looks like. Criminal ticket.\" Another set of blinks and double takes. How many young idiots name-drop NCIC on a TStop?\n\n\"You have wants? Like for FTA?\" #2 was shorter and stockier, a lot closer to my size. He was definitely the more gruff of the two.\n\n\"Oh hell no,\" I responded. \"I've got a ticket, it's been continued like 6 times. Still open. I just don't know what that looks like, only that I'm probably supposed to tell you. I've got a court date.\"\n\nThe first officer left and ran my info, while the second guy became a little more cordial and asked about the case. I regaled him with the tale of **The Ticket** (above). He seemed sympathetic, to a point. When I told him it was campus PD, he laughed.\n\n\"Gouging more money out of you, huh?\"\n\n\"That's exactly what I said!\" I exclaimed, the wound from that indignity sill fresh.\n\nThe first officer reapproached. \"Here's your license back.\" He handed it to me. \"You're all good, open case showed up, obviously you're taking care of it, it's NBD.\"\n\nGnarly. I popped the keys in the ignition and got ready to head for nuggets.\n\n\"Real quick though-\" My heart skipped. \"Just stick around for a minute. Don't go anywhere.\"\n\nI stammered out something that sounded like \"No problem\" as the crushing realization that I was going to be swept up in my friends' cloud of weed smoke and bad decisions washed over me. I watched the flashlights head up a little path, as I was confronted with dilemma. Do I warn my friends and become an accessory, or do I let them take the fall for their poor decision making. I watched the lights get further and further off. I was sweating. I though of my best friend, a good dude who definitely was not jail material. I muttered, \"Fuck it,\" pulled out my phone, and called him. Voicemail. Shit. Called again, voicemail again. The thing is on silent. Shit. Before I can bang out a \"COPS! Ditch it!\" text, my old roommate, one of the old squad and the floozy come walking out to their car. They all look pretty shaken up, I flashed them with my headlights, and my old roomie comes over.\n\n\"Bro, what happened? I called Tom but he didn't answer.\"\n\nRoomie was white as a sheet. \"They fucking snuck right up on us. Call wouldn't have made a difference. Rick was the only one burning when they got there, but he saw the lights and slipped Erin at least some of his ounce.\"\n\n\"Woah woah woah. FUCKING OUNCE?!\" I half-yelled. \"What the shit? Since when does he do that?!\" I was really squirming now. \"How do you even slip that much on the low?\"\n\nRoomie shook his head. \"Dunno. They said we were free to go, Erin's getting the hell out of here. Me and Jack are walking. Did they talk to you?\"\n\nI told him I was clean (why wouldn't I be?) but I was still technically detained. He wished me luck and the three of them left in a big hurry, only seconds before I saw the two boys in blue walking out with Tom and our Pablo Escobar wannabe. Oh dear. As they passed under a streetlight, I could see Pablo was in cuffs. Fucking. Anus. I'm about to watch this moron go to jail. I'm gonna have to explain to his mom and his sister how this idiot thinks he's an OG trapper because he listened to Migos once and now he's in county main jail.\n\nI watch as he's bent over the hood of the Interceptor, full patdown, whole 9. Tom is just standing off to the side, chatting with the stocky cop, watching Pablo get the full treatment. I can see a cigs pack come out, wallet, phone, keys, everything. They sniff his soda cup and promptly dump it. Shit, he was drinking too? The moron is 20. I turn my attention back to Tom, who's shaking hands with Stocky and being walked over to my car. I roll the windows back down.\n\n\"What's the deal?\" I asked.\n\n\"Buddy here has had a little too much to smoke,\" came the reply. I made a disapproving noise. \"He's super cooperative, very polite, not totally smacked, so I'm releasing him to you to take home.\" I silently thanked the gods that at least the two of us were walking away. \"Get in his car.\"\n\nTom loaded back into my truck and sat down as the cop leaned in the window. \"You know you're gonna drag your friend here down with you one day?\" \n\nTom shook his head. \"No way man. I always have to remind that idoit-\" he jabbed his finger at Pablo - \"that our boy here is tryna be a cop when he gets done with his degree. We insulate him from that best we can.\" I nodded in agreement, after all it was a true statement.\n\n\"Fair enough,\" remarked Stocky. \"Hang tight, we're not really sure what we're doing with your buddy yet. Real quick, his name is Pablo Escobar?\" I nodded. \"What street?\"\n\n\"Plant Tree Road, I think? I'm not 100%\" I said. Tom added, \"Yeah, Plant Tree for sure.\" \"Why, no return for him?\" I asked. \n\n\"Nope. He ever had a license?\" We both shook our heads. The kid was kind of a waster, made us take him everywhere. \"Alright then.\"\n\nTom then told me that he hadn't gotten my call, nor had he known that Pablo was doing his best impression of a one-man cartel. They'd seen the lights and figured it was \"one time\", and he passed a fistful of bud to the harlot and started to chuck the rest into a pond. He'd neglected to extinguish his joint, however, and our badged friends had found it still-smoldering in the grass next to him. Somehow, the weed blended in with the copious amounts of algae and pond scum in the dark, and no one said anything. As soon as he had told me this harrowing tale, however, an ambo crew arrived. Interesting.\n\nBy now, I figured Pablo had claimed he was drunk and/or high, and wanted hospital, hoping it would keep him from getting arrested. I later found out that when the officers were walking him out, he'd slipped in mud, and the officers though he was waaaay too drunk or that there was PCP in his grass and he was seizing. Either way, I grabbed my phone and loaded up the local scanner, hoping to glean some info about our inebriated acquaintance. We sat there and listened to a few garbled transmissions for a minute before the first officer came and knocked on the window.\n\n\"What's up, we getting Periscoped?\" he quipped, gesturing  at my phone in my hand with a smile. I laughed.\n\n\"No, no. Scanner. Obviously, we have a vested interest into the outcome - hoping for some news.\"\n\nI then had to launch into an explanation of how I got the scanner on my phone, WHY I got the scanner on my phone, and so forth. This led to Tom spitting out the \"he wants to be a cop\" line again, which grabbed his attention right as Stocky came back over and piped up.\n\n\"You done ridealongs up here?\" he inquired. I had, and said so, and was met with \"What station?\" I named off the station and shift times I'd gone for, and after some pressing, begrudgingly named the kind officer who'd shown me the ropes more than once (I'd hoped to avoid doing exactly that in this scenario, but, life is what it is, I guess). Neither knew him, but they knew the unit, and nodded with approval. #1 chimed in again.\n\n\"Well, seeing as we have a budding officer here, and you've already got one of your pals here, I think we'll cut your other buddy loose too. He had weed on him, so he's getting cited, but we're gonna let him walk.\"\n\n\"Really? I mean, awesome, I'm sure he appreciates it. I didn't know we had weed tickets here in this state.\"\n\nNumber 1 shrugged. \"Call it discretion. We have his info, if the CO doesn't like it we'll come back and grab him.\" \n\n\"Fair play. Can you clean him out good, then? Don't want to catch a BS charge over his poor decisions.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"Trust me, we got everything.\" I nervously laughed, knowing they hadn't, just eager to get out of the whole scenario. Pablo walked out of the ambo and was escorted over by Stocky, who put him in my backseat.\n\n\"Listen,\" started Stocky. \"I can totally take you both to jail right now. Public intox. You, possession and underage drinking, too. You're both being trespassed from here. I have your info. If I ever see you here, or any other park or school again, jail. That's it.\" I sat there, twiddling my thumbs, itching to go. \"Your buddy here can tell you you're getting a big break.\" I nodded furiously. \"Only reason you're not going, Tom, you were super cooperative, plus you're not totally over the line. Pablo, cooperative was not gonna save you. What is is that I'm not doing the paperwork, and your friend has better career aspirations than you.\" More nervous sweat ran down my sides. \"Get out of here. Drive safe.\" We all muttered thank you, I dropped the truck into D, and we cruised away. \n\nAfter 20 seconds, Pablo burst out - \"DudeI'msofuckingsorryIknowwhatyou'redoingwithyourlifethat'swhyIdidn'tbringitinyourcarIknowyoudidn'tknowIdidn'twanttoinvolveyouI'msososososososorry-\" I cut him off. \"Motherfucker. I am taking you both to Pablo's. I am leaving. I am going to get chicken nuggets. Then I am going home.\" We drove the rest of the way in silence. True to my word, I stopped in front of Pablo's house, told him to pray thanks to his weed gods that he wasn't locked up, said a quick goodbye to Tom, and headed for McDonalds. And you know what? Those nuggets made it all worthwhile.",
