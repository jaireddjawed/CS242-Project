But for me, they never did become one.  The cream cheese was just too low in the bowl.  I could barely whip it at all.  The ice cream was still seriously great and I can't wait to make a different flavor in the coming days, but it had chunks of cream cheese in it (honestly, they were great just like that so maybe I shouldn't mess with it).  Any ideas on how I would coax 2 oz of cream cheese to merge with heavy cream?  I used the recipe for Sarah Kieffer's book, 100 Cookies in case that matters.",

They just don‚Äôt seem to ever last very long - this is my first set that have never seen a flatshare and flatmates who refused to stop using metal utensils but they still only lasted 4 years.\n\nThe problem is, I‚Äôm disabled so something like le creuset or other heavy things aren‚Äôt really an option. I also use a dishwasher most of the time because I need to prioritise what to use my energy on. My hob is also induction and I hang my pans up on hooks due to a very small kitchen and my disability (so they need a hole!). I also prefer them to have a handle that doesn‚Äôt heat up although that‚Äôs not a deal breaker. \n\nWith that in mind, are there any recommendations for cookware that would have better longevity/not be damaged by higher heat that‚Äôs still lightweight? It absolutely has to be non stick due to a health condition meaning I have to keep my fat intake very low. \n\nBudget wise, if it was something that was actually going to last a long time, even if putting in the dishwasher, then within reason budget is not my biggest concern - although I‚Äôd really have to be able to justify a larger purchase and ideally I probably want 3 pans again - at least eventually. \n\nMy other consideration is if there‚Äôs nothing lightweight that‚Äôs any better than any old non stick/ceramic frying pan then maybe getting a single le creuset pan (or better recommendation) to just live on the hob alongside my cheaper hanging pans so I don‚Äôt have to lift it to use - but it means probably having to leave it for my wife to wash up and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to cook things in it that required a lift and pour/scrape so not sure how practical it really is!\n\nI‚Äôm also in the Uk if you‚Äôre giving specific recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Has anyone had issues with using the extra virgin at such high heat? 550F is well above its smoke point.\n\n[https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe)",
