        "text": "I had to switch over from Adderall because of the shortage. I had absolutely  no side effects on Adderall, if anything it made me feel more like myself than I have in years. \n\nI’ve only been on Vyvanse 2 days. About 4 hours in, I start feeling very weird, the only way I can describe it is it feels like a really bad grass high which I hate (I can’t post the other word). I can barely do anything, and I get nauseous/dizzy. This will last ~2 hours and then I feel fine after, at that stage the effects feel similar to Adderall, but not quite as effective. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this ? It seems like it’s releasing too much during it’s peak for me. I’m on a low starting dose and going lower seems like it wouldn’t work the rest of the day. I’m taking it with protein but I can’t think of anything else. Do I need to eat again before peak time? Is my body just adjusting ?",

I'm looking for my own place now, but I'm safe, and the people I'm with are so supportive, and I've never felt safer. \n\nFriday morning, I left where I was, leaving behind most of my things in a set of boxes with them. my partner (brand new, btw! we've only just gotten together.) and I left for a trip I'd been wanting and planning to go on since I turned 18 a couple of years ago. \n\nI wasn't able to go on this trip before, and I was made to feel like it was because I couldn't, but I've been made aware that it was because the people I was with at the time didn't like the idea. I feel hurt by them, but all's well that ends well, right? \n\nI spent Friday until witching hour on Monday morning (today) on this fantastic trip. I stayed at the hotel I'd been looking at for an age, visited every site I wanted to, and spent a fantastic time doing and seeing these amazing things. \n\ntoday, Monday, I had an interview for a job I've been trying to get for a while. I had a tour of the place a week or so prior, and the site is just amazing. the other staff seem excellent, the facility is perfect, and I truly hope I'm successful. \n\nit's so hard to think that just over a year ago, I was sitting across from a clinical psychologist, receiving my diagnosis. just over a year ago, I was given a ten-page document affirming what I'd known for a while, confirming and allowing me to finally get the support I've needed for as long as I'd been aware of my thought process. \n\nI talked through how my interview went with my partner (we didn't have time for me to drop him home... he waited in the car.), and well, they're certain I've got the job. I, however, am not so sure. I'm sure that there are so many more applicants with more experience, higher qualifications, who are a better fit, and answered all the interview questions better. applicants with better CVs and resumes, applicants who aren't a mess. \n\nwhat I do know, however, is that they told me that I will be told whether I was successful or not within the next week. \n\nI'm so excited, and I can't wait to hear back. I'll edit with an update when I get it. \n\nthings are finally looking up.",

However, once ran out of the first 7 capsules and started using the caps from the rest of the persciption, I have not felt a thing and I am so fed up because I haven't felt this useless in years.

I think I will be more productive this was. What do you think about this approach? Would you recommend a different method?

        "text": "Hi. This is my first time posting or trying to actually get an answer online about an issue related to ADHD and it is quite a big post.\n\nTo give a small background, I am 28M, i have been diagnosed with ADHD and a couple of autism notes when I was 6 or 7 by 2 different Psychiatrists and later on confirmed by another when I was 9 (my mom at that time was not really believing in it, it was a long time ago and I live in a 3rd world country). When I was little I would always lose focus at school, have a hard time paying attention to class because it was incredibly boring and had an extremly poor time management but my advantage at that time was that I was swimming, one practice in the morning and one in the evening that helped me be kept in line. I did this until I was 14 when I shifted to basketball for another 4 years and then random sports from time to time. \nMy parents were extremly strict because of all this, I never had money on me, I always had to be picky about friends because sometimes they would contest them, my pc had a password untill I was 14, a lot of the thing that ai did or find pleaure in(like music) were contested under the pretext that those things will make me misserable at some point and they recommended to do thigs like everyone like get some shitty job as an accountant or something like that.\n\nAfter I turned 18, they kind of let me live on my own, still sleeping home, but you know..do things on my own, where I discovered nightclubs and music, REAL, music. My life was chaos by ..I was happy. Had a lot of girlfriends you know...with ups and downs managed to get a job get promoted then switch job get promoted and so on. \n\nFor the past 6 years I have been in a relationship, we have a house together, I proposed to her and we mostly have a happy life, however somtimes, i forget to do things. Sometimes I forget how to do things, or I am not truly paying attention to them. To give an example a few months ago i burned a steak (i did steaks for at least 10 times before). Sometimes she doesn't like how I rract to some things (eye rolling) and she told me a million times to not do so BUT I GENUENLY FORGET. I often strugle to sleep in a quite enviorment so I sometimes sleep in the livingroom and she is annoyed by this. These are just a few.\n\nI tried before (a couple of years ago) to explain things to her. I even showed her a book of 300 pages about adhd and pointed to her in the book exactly the behaviour I sometimes have but with no luck. In her opinion I am just making excuses. To be noted thes she is not denying that I have ADHD, she is just saying to not throw the blame on it. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying \"sorry I have ADHD\" whenever I do a stupid thing because I know that I should try and live like a normal person, I am just trying to make her understand what is going on so she can stop being frustrated. Lately we have been in a bad period where she can not suffer me anymore because we work different schedules (to acomodate my sleep problems), I am also in the music industry which is a dream of mine that she supported and it takes a lot of our time together. I forget about regular life things (like buying insurance for the house) and today, I rolled my eyes again (and I TOTALLY FORGOT that it pisses her of, it was just a reflex) and she can not stand me anymore. \n\nNow my question is how do I cope with it? How to think like normal fucking human being and not be chaos? Here I am posting on internet because I don't have anyone in my life that would truly understand my view and the fact that my brain is not broken, but just wored differently. My parents would understand but thats just it I woukd get a \"sucks to be you\" kind of answer. I dont have friends anymore because they were toxic af and my girlfriend which has been my best friend for the past years thinks that I am just making excuses and I am a bad boyfriend and not love her.",

I'm just finishing up school and this shortage is affecting my work, social life, school work, and home life. Anything would help. Again, I have tried dosage changes, switching to XR and calling allllll pharmacies in the area with no luck.

        "text": "Ever forget to defrost the chicken? Or even eat leftovers? Or do commitments on your calendar? Or get a refund on something? Practicing \"Time Travel\" can help.\n\n\"Time Travel\" is the cognitive capacity to imagine a future event so that one may do something for that future context. For example, putting the leftovers in the fridge and then eating them the next day.\n\nFor me, however, in order for it to work, I've found that I need to lean heavily into the \"imagining\" part. It's not enough for me to simply put the leftovers in the fridge and hope that I eat them. No, in order for me to do the thing, I literally IMAGINE myself \"Tomorrow, at noon, when I go on lunch, I will have that tupperware of leftovers for lunch\"\n\nWhat does imagining it do? for me: It creates a bookmark in my mind that makes it so that I am reminded of the objective once that future context arrives.\n\nThere is a specific structure to this to help me imagine it: Time estimate, Trigger, Preparation, Objective. The above example have no preparation stated, but here it is not needed. Preparation is mostly needed when something needs to be done at a specific time, e.g. \"Tuesday, at 4:30pm (the specific time itself is the trigger) I will wrap up work (the prep) so that I can leave by 4:45 (a time sensitive objective) to make it to a doctor's appointment (the ultimate objective)\"\n\nThe HARD PART is defining each of these. You might have a time to do a thing, but not the triggering context; you'll have to define it. You have to check if any prep is needed \n\nOther Examples:\n\nTasks on my work calendar: \"At 2:30pm, I will make a note of what I am doing, what remains to be done, and wrap it up so that I can begin this task\"\nShipping out a package: \"Saturday, around 10am, after I have finished breakfast and drank my coffee, I will drive out to UPS to ship this package\"\nTaking the garbage out to the curb: \"Tuesday nights, around 9pm, before I get ready for bed, I will make sure that all of the remaining trash and recycling is in the bins and then take the bins to the curb\"\n\nAgain, the exercise here is to DEFINE the situation in which you do the thing, and actually IMAGINE it so that it creates a trigger to remember it.\n\nLemme know what you think of this?",

That's a lot of time without medication, and certainly long enough to have some detrimental effects on many people. How in the world is this not a bigger deal right now and of utmost importance to the DEA, FDA and drug manufacturers. They knew demand has been increasing, yet failed to take appropriate steps to meet demand. Is it going to take the headline of me, \"Nurse accidentally kills patient, attributes to lack of ADHD medication\" for them to wake up and understand the urgency here?? What can we do to force a change in practice and policy? Because no one should EVER have to go through this...",

However, I’ll be leaving for a week long work trip tomorrow and won’t be able to pick it up in time. That means for the first time in almost a year I’ll be off it for any time period. I’m quite nervous about this and wondering how bad is the withdrawal really and what are some things that help combat the negative effects of it?",

        "text": "Hello internet stranger!\n\nHow's your ADHD treating you,\n\nstill dealing with it every fucking day?\n\nAre you fed up with the constant agonizing fight it takes to do necessary things you don't want to do that you know would be good for you to do?  \n\n\nLike many of us here in this sub, despite 10+ years of therapy, stimulants, and lifestyle optimizations, I continue to suffer greatly due to the lack of control over my executive system;\n\nHow is that I am able to give myself a simple command like: \"pick up your left hand, open and close it 3x and put it back down\" and effortlessly accomplish it...\n\nyet the second I give myself a mental command like: \"do the laundry\" I have to cross a chasm of mental fire to get myself to pull it off, which invariably leads to weeks of avoiding the excruciating pain of doing something I don't find fun?  \n\n\nIt only really hit me a few months ago: *there are normal people fundamentally different than you that feel close to zero \"oh fuck I hate this\" mental pain sensations*, they can just do their taxes and their dishes with the same amount of ease that we experience deciding to pick up our hand for a moment on command...\n\nIf you can move your hand on command, you should be able to direct yourself to follow any other command without any kind of meaningful suffering. The fact that we can't shows us we are not in control of our minds and that is **totally unacceptable**.  \n\n\nOver the past 2 months, I reached out to many of the top experts in the field to inquire why we are so far from arriving at a real solution [despite ADHD having been professionally studied and treated for the last 60 years](https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/history#1980), and discovered terrible incentives have compromised progress:\n\nThe world of academia relies upon grants. If you're running an ADHD research lab, year after year you get bigger grants so you can hire more staff and publish more papers, which means if they actually figured out a real solution, their whole lab, career, and social life grinds to a halt.  \n\n\nThink about that, with the exception of stimulants, for the past several decades, 99% of academic \"progress\" has consisted of feigning intent to solving the problem, getting awarded grants to research useless incremental \"solutions\" that does nothing except to selfishly boost their prestige, while we the people they claim to be helping are left out to dry.\n\nIf you think I'm being too harsh, consider that our suffering is so intense, [we are at least 5x more likely to kill ourselves](https://nationalpost.com/wellness/women/women-with-adhd-and-the-risk-of-suicide-attempts), ..our lives are at stake, yet 99% of academics build professional careers suckling on our prolonged pain and mounting suicides.  \n\n\nCompounding the problem, social media has encouraged niche adhd influencers to focus on flaunting disability as an identity.\n\nOnce someone builds up a successful business persona of \"oops I'm always distracted and forgetting things, isn't my adhd so quirky and relatable? check out this new (sponsored) app!\",\n\nWhy would they be interested in actually solving the problem? Their career as a goofy, perpetual adhd-saddled influencer ends with a whimper if they don't adapt in a major way. The path of least resistance seduces them to stay where they are and keep suckling the status quo, just like the academics.  \n\n\nWe have to take a stand.\n\nThis problem shouldn't take more than a few seriously focused years to solve.  \n\n\nSo I'm excited to announce, I'm putting my money where my mouth is, and I am concentrating all of my hyper-focusing firepower towards solving adhd once and for all:\n\n**I will definitively solve adhd or I will die trying.**  \n\n\nTo be clear, I love all of the good things that are often correlated with adhd like imagination, creativity, innovation, etc and I propose only zero compromise solutions to conquering adhd that retains or maximizes all of the perks.\n\nI am interested solely in the purest level of winning: true effortless control of *how I choose to feel* about doing anything if I so choose, resulting in experiencing zero mental pain.\n\nI will not stop until we have achieved total victory.  \n\n\nHere are 3 primary attack vectors I've devised thus far:\n\n**1.** **Transcranial direct current stimulation** (tDCS) - the US military has experimented with it to great success:\n\n[Just 20 minutes of low intensity current applied painlessly to the scalp can reliably generate a massive increase in performance and memory.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoEu2mEdLjw)\n\nIt works by providing both a stimulant effect equal to caffeine, and more notably, by seeming to disable higher level brain activity in regions associated with constant mental chatter, which induces a laser like flow state where the voices quiet and you are just purely present.\n\nThis also dramatically reduces the perceived level of effort felt in performing a given task, as being present and engrossed in what we do is inherently pleasurable, which is why you can see buddhist monks sweeping temples for hours.\n\nSally Adee, a newscientist journalist [who wrote about her experiences in trying tDCS at a military research facility](https://www.lastwordonnothing.com/2012/02/09/better-living-through-electrochemistry/), said that electricity was the most powerful drug she had ever tried, comparable to Adderall, and substantially better in many ways.\n\nShe found it ignited a sense of profound serenity, having been freed of the relentless unhelpful chatter of the mind, something she had only glimpsed after hours of yoga, she was able to dramatically focus and excel...after a few days, she found herself slowly drifting back down to her normal chaotic anxiety ridden unproductive state and thought constantly of trying tDCS again.\n\nThis might just be the silver bullet; I will be fully investigating it in a safe and controlled manner under medical supervision to see if it solves the problem.  \n\n\n**attack vector #2:** **Use EEGs to automatically administer rewards.**  \n\n\nI've always rolled my eyes when professionally trained therapists and academics dole out misplaced advice like \"reward yourself often! give yourself a cookie after doing the dishes!\", as it very quickly turns into \"why not just have the cookie now and do the dishes later?\"\n\nConsciously rewarding ourselves takes self discipline in the first place, which I am lacking in spades, so how can we administer external rewards in a way that doesn't require self discipline?\n\nOne solution I thought of: [use an EEG helmet to record shifts in brain states](https://youtu.be/10J6crRacZg) associated with successful accomplishment, and then linking those brainwave spikes ([likely gamma wave spikes](https://youtu.be/10J6crRacZg?t=50)) to trigger external rewards in real-time.\n\nI imagine starting with EEG devices like [emotiv](https://www.emotiv.com/insight/) or [openbci](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage) that could link with [synchronized bluetooth lights and speakers](https://youtu.be/2_ULi-eCIGA?t=52) that automatically trigger a slot machine styled celebration upon the detection of a brainwave spike at a specified threshold associated with completion/accomplishment of a task.\n\nThe EEG could also be connected to a [neuralink primate banana smoothie machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsCul1sp4hQ), whatever works!\n\nThis could finally solve the problem of responsibly administering our own rewards without requiring any conscious self discipline!  \n\n\n**Attack vector #3: Augmented/mixed reality gamification.**  \n\n\nIf tracking and linking brainwave spikes associated with successful task completion to trigger external rewards still doesn't do the trick,\n\nthen what I need is a full gamified/quantified AR headset I can wear that can gamify anything and everything in real time and [simultaneously integrates](https://galea.co/#home) real time EEG feedback.  \n\n\nI would ruthlessly copy what works well in video games: have regularized metrics, feedback, performance, and rewards built into everything I do, in such a way where I am not responsible for being disciplined to administer those rewards, instead it happens automatically like a videogame.\n\nIt should be able to detect exactly when I am starting to feel measurable levels of resistance/boredom/avoidance during work, and then autotrigger more combinations of motivation-generating stimuli from the buffet of reward options:\n\nthings like real time readouts of brainwave clusters labeled by type and intensity, reminders of what to focus on, music, images you customize of long term goals you deeply desire correlated to pop up in your field of view in response to specific patterns of brainwave responses,\n\nWhatever it takes to make the task inherently fun/meaningful/motivating!  \n\n\n**The pain of perceived effort must dissolve entirely**, just as it does when playing a video game, despite the immense amount of mental concentration and hand-eye coordination needed to strategically play an FPS.  \n\n\nIn a few years, later versions could integrate some combination of OpenAI Whisper, ChatGPT, and StableDiffusion, so you could be able to tell it: \"I have to do the dishes, make it fun\" and it then renders and deploys a super fun visually exciting whimsical game to play, something to the effect of:  \n\n\n\\~\\~ Specs of food particles stuck on a plate turn into little zombies that yell as you scrub them off and morph into colorful songbirds, while the plates constantly praise and thank you for cleaning them and exude psychedelic ripples of gratitude.\n\nEfficiency metrics and stats appear in the HUD tabulating how well you are doing compared to past performance in real time. \\~\\~\n\n[The opening 2 minutes of this short film envisions a technology kind of what I'm thinking of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lK_cdkpazjI) (putting aside the tech-is-bad dystopian bias and disavowing all abuses of using this tech for evil)\n\nReal products are coming out right now that [simultaneously integrates both AR and EEG](https://galea.co/#home); I predict we'll see a mainstream adoption of this kind of quantified-brain tech in the next few years as Meta and Apple duke it out.  \n\n\nSo, how can you trust that I will actually follow through with this?  \n\n\nI am starting a youtube channel to publish everything I learn along the journey, including interviews with top experts, and actual experimentation on myself to accomplish 3 things:\n\n1. to imbue myself with a sense of public accountability (and therefore increased motivation to complete this project)\n2. to simultaneously build a strong truth-seeking, problem solving, focused community of optimistic people that actually want to beat adhd and will thus increase our speed and chances of success.\n\n(I also want to throw the most epic victory party for us imaginable when we pull this off)\n\n3. As we pull this off successfully, I want to reach the greatest number of people as fast as possible that are struggling with this problem and immediately put a stop to needless suffering, as [people with adhd are at least 5x more likely to commit suicide.](https://nationalpost.com/wellness/women/women-with-adhd-and-the-risk-of-suicide-attempts)\n\nTo me, adhd is only truly solved once interfacing with **any** task has been reduced to a level of an adjustable gameplay cheatcode. It should be **100% painless to do anything you want on command.**\n\n  \nSo!  \n\n\nIf the prospect of truly going for it in life and beating the FUCK out of ADHD once and for all **excites you to your core** and you're interested in helping be part of the solution and want to have optimistic creative-solution-focused-conversations, I'd love to team up and brainstorm strategic ideas that may help the trajectory of successful outcomes!  \n\n\n**p.s.**\n\nIt may be there are simpler, just as effective, **entirely analog solutions** that people have already figured out that I'm ignorant of:\n\nIf you've devised a generalizable framework for **effortless** gamification of **any task** no matter how simple or complex, I'd *really* love to talk with you and possibly interview you too!  \n\n\ndisclaimer:  \n\n\nI am not an expert in anything medical, legal, financial, or anything else for that matter. I give no advice whatsoever. I simply tear open a path of possibility, leaving it open for further exploration while you assume all of the risk, responsibility, and liability. I am not a role model worth emulating. I am a walking contradiction of kindness and cruelty, lover and hater, aspiring truth seeker and bumbling confabulator.",

Please can you all give me some insights into having ADHD, how it impacts you, your relationship and things I can do to not get mad or frustrated with things beyond his control. \n\nSo I've been with my boyfriend (31m) for almost 10 months and I've strongly suspected he has ADHD. I'm pretty clued up on it and its symptoms as I've long been interested in mental health conditions and psychology sort of topics. I mentioned it to him and he very much agreed and we're currently waiting for an assessment through RTC. Although not officially diagnosed, we and the GP who referred him are fairly certain he will get an official diagnoses.\n\nBeing in a relationship with someone with potential ADHD is completely different to just reading about the symptoms on an NHS page. My boyfriend is also someone who struggles with feelings and emotions and so when I ask questions to understand what ADHD means for him and how it impacts him , I struggle to get anything back. He is by nature an introvert and finds it hard to express himself.\n\nI'm sure I don't have to tell everyone here about how some of the more 'ADHD' behaviours can impact a relationship but I truly just need and want to understand how he feels and the reason and rhyme behind some of the things that impact us. He didn't have a lot of parenting growing up and he's said no teachers or ex girlfriends ever told him or suggested he had ADHD and it makes me so sad that never has really truly tried to understand him.\n\nAs some context to some of the things he struggles with:\n\n- getting very frustrated and being unable to control feelings when loud noises (especially children crying or playing) are around \n- gets frustrated at himself when he does something impulsively that he can't explain the reason behind \n- saying mean things about people but then instantly regretting it when I call it out \n- being very reactive and getting personal when he feels he's being attacked \n- hard for him to maintain a conversation if it isn't about his own interests \n- becoming hyper fixated on me (and previous relationships) \n- finds it hard to retain information \n- interrupts conversations and struggles to wait his turn to speak \n- takes things very personally and gets defensive \n\nI try so hard to not get frustrated or upset over some things from the list above but im a horrible girlfriend who sometimes does get pissed off. Please can you all give me some insights into having ADHD, how it impacts you, your relationship and things I can do to not get mad or frustrated with things beyond his control. \n\nThank you!",

May take some more adjustment time but I’m experiencing GI issues, irritability, lack of focus or motivation and cold extremities. I do feel stimulated and alert, but not the clarity or memory issue resolution that adderall provides. Overall, it feels like a shell of adderall but with a similar engine powering it (if that makes any sense).\n\nSome other meds I’m going to discuss with doctor - dexedrine, mydayis and adzenys. \n\nAnyone who took aderall and switched to one of these with success (in both effectiveness and pharmacy supply)?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11jf133/aita_for_being_irritated_about_my_adhd_friend/",
        "text": "I (21nb) have adhd and autism as well but  im very obsessive and strict on time and wasting time. My best friend on the other hand is the complete opposite and is always late to things and when i say always its always without fail ever since ive known her. She used to blame her mother for making her late for school but over the years i realized she just never cared about being on time to school. While thats not a big deal cause school sucks now that we’re adults it really gets under my skin. \n\nShes been late to my birthday dinners, hang outs, events we agreed to go to together, and was even so late to an event she was hosting that she missed the entire thing after begging me to come. She always has some wild explanation as to why shes late, chalking it up to just bad luck. I know she has adhd and struggles greatly with time management and time perception but its like no matter how heavily i emphasize  how important it is to me she still goes about things the same way and manages to be hours late. \n\nIve asked what i could do to help her or remind her and I usually am texting her the entire time leading up to the event to keep her on track but nothing works. Putting aside the great anxiety I feel when people are late and i am waiting awkwardly, i think its a bit rude to waste so much of peoples time. Its hard to sympathize when i know there are things she could do to help prevent or make the situation less inconvenient for others. \n\nMost recently we agreed to go to a korean bbq restaurant with another friend of ours with autism. We all agreed on 1:30pm and she lives the farthest from the restaurant. Our friend was the earliest of us all but still a little late at around 1:45. Im usualy always on time or early because i hate to be late but ive discovered i hate waiting around for people even more so i left once our friend got there and arrived shortly after at around 1:55. At this point my best friend still hasnt left her house but assures us she will be getting in the car in 3 minutes. She doesnt get in the car until 20+ minutes later, she gets into traffic and doesnt arrive until 2 hours  later. Meanwhile me and my friend have been walking around outside going in and out of stores because the restaurant doesnt seat incomplete parties. \n\nAnother reason this gets under my skin is the attitude she has towards it. She will arrive in a Sing song mood as if people havent been waiting on her for hours and hours. She may or may not apologize at all and will quickly tell you about how its not her fault and it was out of her control. Time is really important to me, i see it as currency. After our last encounter i realized that the things i dislike about her most are the things that probably wont change. I hate to be insensitive especially since I know what having a different brain is like but its not something im willing to compromise on and it never fails to ruin my mood whenever we hang out. Time is too precious to waste and i wish she made it important to her (when it comes to our plans) because she knows it’s important to me. I dont expect her to never be late or to be exactly on time but hours and hours can be a bit much and its definitely ruining our friendship.",

I believe there is a rule where you can only request to refill 2 days before? Then the provider has to approve and send the RX. With the shortage a lot of places don't have any at all, so waiting 2 days before you're out means you'll be without meds for who knows how long. How do you all usually make this work? This is one reason I feel anxious taking it everyday...I don't want to be used to having it every single day and then have to go a while not taking anything in a row.",

It’s still better than without meds - and I prefer the sustained coverage and scope of what I feel it helps than Elvanse; but it lacks the strength of what I experienced on Elvanse on the lower doses.\n\nUltimately, I prefer Elvanse, but it’s just not quite enough. \n\nI saw that the likely next step would be to be moved to straight dexamfetamine (amfexa/Dexedrine).

When I was a child my doctor suspected I had ADHD and the assessment he gave me and my mom confirmed it, but my mom didn't want to spend money to finish getting me evaluated at a psych or spending money on meds (or taking any meds at all)\n\nIt wasn't until I was a grown adult that I was helped by my wife to take it seriously again and try to get help for it.\n\nA year ago I talked to my doctor about it, he asked a lot of questions, had me take a test, and along with the test gave him full confidence I have ADHD and set an appointment to meet with a psych to see what treatment would work best. I had to wait 8 months, filled out 20 or so pages of tests, family history of ADHD, school records of inattentiveness, etc etc. I finally got to talk to the psych and all it was was a 20 minute phone call, she had me do a very short test and a week later she gave me the results that my test showed \"strong signs of possible ADHD\" but she noted that during our call she didn't suspect ADHD was impacting me or my life and suggested to simply make better organizational habits. I was pissed, she barely asked me any questions and it was only about when I was a child. I requested to be reevaluated with a different psych and they said it could be another 3 months, and then probably another 8 months again after that.\n\nI'm looking online for care and treatment and found a few good options (not sure if I can post their names). It's not cheap, my insurance won't cover it, but from everything I've read it's all done very quickly. One of them can get me an appointment in less than 5 days. I'm not thrilled about having to pay a lot up front so I'm hoping people on here can help give me suggestions on what I should do.",

        "text": "Most of my life, I seem to just go on autopilot, not truly being conscious of what I am saying and doing. Sometimes I like myself, sometimes I hate myself, but every so often, I get a glimpse of who I truly am, and who I could have been had it not been for my ADHD.\n\nI guess I am fortunate that I am above average intelligence; it has helped somewhat to make up for my deficiencies in other areas. I have done pretty well in my career. I have a job I like for the most part, with a smaller company I have been with for 26 years now. Over that time, I have managed to move up to upper management, and am now one of two managers who run the company. That's pretty great, I guess, but I feel I could be so much more, and also do so much more for my company.\n\nI do ok in my position as one of the leaders of my company, but I feel like a fraud many days as I make myself look busy, but can't make myself get things done. Despite the prescription drugs that help me immensely, I struggle more now than I did ten years ago; I doubt the man I am today would have been able to move up into the position I am in now. I do get a lot done, and am an asset to my company, but there are always literally hundreds of things on my ever growing task list that never get done, and I am always behind and making excuses as to how busy I am.  \n\nI hate this. I get energy and happiness from accomplishments; I hate feeling like a slacker and do not enjoy getting away with goofing off all day on the days I can't make myself be productive. I have always been (and still am) extremely ambitious, and want to do great things with my life. I have always felt that someday I would overcome my issues and accomplish my dreams, but now I find myself doing a mediocre job at work, and then not being able to accomplish anything at home. It's a good weekend for me if I manage to get my laundry done.  \n\nI dropped out of college to take the job that ended up being my career, and for the most part do not regret it. I have always wondered who I would have become though, had I been able to focus in school and such. I always wanted to be a writer. I always wanted to get married and have a few kids. I always wanted to own my business, have many investments, and be respected. Instead, I am married to my job, working 10-14 hours a day, but only getting a few hours of real work done most days. I come home to a trashed house that overwhelms me and I can never clean. I have a personal to0do list many pages long that I am always adding to, but rarely accomplishing any of it. I have piles of bills on my desk I haven't paid, not because I don't have the money, but because I can't make myself do the work. I come home each day to an empty house, filled with all of my many broken dreams.\n\nDue to many reasons, I don't believe there is a god. One of them is, if there is a god, he is the biggest fucking asshole. What kind of \"loving god\" would make someone like me who is ambitious as hell, but unable to accomplish anything? A god who would do that to someone is nothing but a sick asshole, who enjoys seeing people suffer.  \n\nI feel like I am getting closer and closer to ending it all. I am not the kind of person who would just do so on a whim on one of my lowest moments; if I ever take that path, it will be a planned out, logical decision, based on evidence proving that nothing I can do can make things better.  It seems to be over the past ten years that the harder I try, the less I accomplish, and the more miserable I become. I love being around people and having friends, but at this point in my life I am all alone and don't see this changing for the better. I don't want to end my life, there is a part of me that loves life so much, and really appreciates the joys of it, but I fear I am close to the day that all hope will be gone, and things are only going to get worse as time passes.\n\nI'm sorry for being such a downer today. I know most of you will not read something this long, as many days I am unable to do so either. I guess I mostly just wrote this because I felt inspired to actually write my thoughts down for once. I'll keep a copy of this in case any of the few people who still care about me have an interest in reading it someday after I am gone. Thanks for listening.",

        "text": "Everyone with ADHD knows the feeling of being essentially couch locked when it comes to chores, work, and school. While I definitely have this terribly, I also have it when it comes to any form of entertainment. There are so many choices and I cannot bring myself to watch anything I put on my list. Same goes for books and reading (a whole other problem I have i.e. my huge bookshelf filled to the brim of books I have maybe read ten pages on only 10 of the books I own). My YouTube watch later list has over 1600 videos, and has been growing since about 2018. My Netflix list has about 30 shows and 30 movies I will never get around to watching because I cannot bring myself to watch any of it as it is so overwhelming. I can't binge watch anything because I have too much going on my mind to pay attention. There will also be times when I get REALLY into a genre or media and I learn so much ABOUT the thing but never actually consume any of the stuff.\n\nFor example, I get phases where I am really into Star Wars or Anime. I will scroll endlessly through the Star Wars wiki and watch YouTube videos about Star Wars lore, but I cannot bring myself to watch the shows or movies. When I get into anime, I will scour the internet for hours or even days looking at lists of the best anime ever or underrated anime, and add them to my list on Funimation, but never get around to watching them because even an anime with 10 episodes is too much for me to sit and focus on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am so frustrated with myself for being this way. I have so many YouTube videos that are interesting to me but I can't sit there and watch them because I cannot pay attention to them or sit there long enough to watch them without getting up or looking up something else and getting lost in that. So many of my friends have their passions with certain anime or TV shows or movies or games and I feel like I am missing out on so much because I can only bring myself to watch what I am comfortable with (Bob's Burgers and Seinfeld basically) and only play the games I am experienced with (Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and Fallout).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just feel like I will never be able to truly enjoy movies and tv shows, books or games because I cannot focus on them and forcing myself to focus on things when I just want to do the next thing that pops into my mind feels mentally painful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure a lot of us have this problem too, and if anyone knows of any way to get better at enjoying things you WANT to be interested in or WANT to get into but can't due to lack of attention PLEASE let me know. It has been a lifelong struggle, as I have probably only ever finished about four shows in my entire life and it pains me mentally sometimes to get through them. I say forcing but that is not necessarily what I mean. I'm not forcing myself to like something I don't like, it is more forcing myself to sit there and pay attention to something I want to like, but my brain/body won't allow me because maybe it is out of my comfort zone or I can't put the mental energy into sitting down, focusing, and trying to enjoy something I want to.",

Once you found your correct dose tolerance still being a big big problem or you can keep taking the med? Not sure if my dose is too low or if i need a booster. Also taking 25 mg of zoloft and really feel that when i take it it reduces the Concerta effect so much. Have you had this same problem?",

        "text": "Every day since I can remember, my fine motor skills have been crap. I've always hated my own body for it: tremors when I try to do something careful, shaking when I wake up early and haven't had any caffeine yet, being unable to eat soup without worrying about the muscles in my arm firing and causing me to embarrass myself. \n\nI met with a psychiatrist several months back and he and I have come to the conclusion that I have always had ADHD (I was treated for anxiety and depression since middle school),and began treatment for it a month back. I feel... So much better. Like I'm not standing on the edge of cliff, like I need to react to everything right now, like everyone is out to get me because why else would they ask what I was doing?\n\nThe other thing I noticed is *my tremors and constant vibrating state is gone when the Focalin XR I was prescribed has had time to enter my system.* Did anyone else have that? Is there any science behind it? I thought it might be relating to dopamine issues and the basal ganglia. Given the close connection between motor function and the basal ganglia, and the fact the basal ganglia requires dopamine to function properly (Parkinson's disease is a condition involving this system, thus why people with parkinson's have tremors as it progresses), maybe the treatment of my ADHD is helping to resolve a dopamine issue that also affected my basal ganglia. \n\nI have had multiple brain surgeries for hydrocephalus I've had since birth, so my case may indeed be unique and due to confounding factors... I've also considered it was anxiety, but even when I'm relaxing and not stressed at all, I physically cannot prevent my tremors from occurring most of the time (unless I am medicated).  Plus, the close relationship between all these functions and hormones is making my brain itch. What's your experience with tremors? Did you have them as a kid before treatment? Did treatment help? Have you gotten any advice from a professional related to this?\n\nAny advice or talking points would be greatly appreciated! :)",

I’m failing at the moment. If i drop this class I’m suspended for a full year again so I’m trying to look at other career options to work on that I can get schooling on during that time.\n\nThe two careers I’m thinking about are either being a personal trainer or going to cosmetology school. I don’t want to give up on college and becoming a mental health professional but I think it would help me mentally to work on a career in the short term then work on my degree for the long term while at that new career. \n\nHowever, I don’t want my adhd to get in the way should I choose a different career path and idk what to do. I guess I’m wondering how did/is college working out for others with adhd? any coping or learning strategies that help?",
