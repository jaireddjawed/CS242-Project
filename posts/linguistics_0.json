        "text": "Hi all,\n\n(Please forgive me while I try to juggle my limited inventory of linguistic terminology while also trying to steer away from making any sweeping generalizations here.) \n\nMy question is: Is there a language whose orthography is mainly phonetic rather than phonemic? \n\nI get why there would a be a trend over time for writing systems to favor phonemic spelling since it isn't immediately influenced by sound changes or regional pronunciation, but I could imagine cultures where this is something that would be prioritized in writing. \n\nWhat actually got me wondering this was the sheer amount of ad hoc spelling that goes down on the Neapolitan-speaking corner of the internet. While there was at one point a literary period, most of the Neapolitan language(s) spoken today lack any standard\\* orthography. It's very common to see people write the language very close to how it sounds and often will distinguish between allophones that occur in either complimentary distribution or free variation in writing. The same word might be spelt a myriad of ways in the same text by the same speaker. \n\nMaybe not the best example since there might be some diglossic code-switching at play, but overall there are definitely observable trends where phonetic representation is favored over phonemic. I am curious if there are any standardized\\* writing systems where this is actually incorporated into the orthography? Perhaps for a script that can represent sounds with more granularity, this would be more common?\n\nWhat's also a bit puzzling is that I feel like a phonetically-influenced system would be more intuitive, at least for the allophones that speakers are conscious of. For example, I remember learning to write in grade school and making errors like \"I sawr a ...\" instead of \"I saw a\" or \"bedda\" instead of \"better\". But maybe there are certain languages where this style of writing is accepted and not considered a mistake.\n\nThe only thing that immediately comes to mind might be classical Arabic(?) Not sure of how often it was done for other important documents, but I remember reading about the amount of care that was taken into writing the Quran and the efforts to preserve an exact way to read the scripture. Don't know any Arabic or what level of detail is present in the writing of the Quran, so can't even say if this would an actual example or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|\\*By standardized, meaning that there is an agreed-upon correspondence between the graphemes used and the sounds sthat they represent. For example, In Neapolitan  \"wajo\" and \"uaglió\" are two ways that the same pronunciation could be represented for the word meaning \"boy\". |\n|:-|",

Your parent knows these friends and asks which Coopers you're going to the mall with. You respond \"Betty and Alice\".\n\nIs there a name for this, or am I totally off?",

The main point seems to be shared: Understanding language doesn't mean understanding the world. ChatGPT can't understand the world because it's only exposed to statistical associations in the language. There's no \"world model\" there.\n\nThe difference, to my non-linguist eye, is that Chomsky says that human understanding comes out because of an innate universal grammar. Bender says that's besides the point. She says the issue is that ChatGPT doesn't have any understanding of what the terms actually mean. Meaning and form are different.\n\nBut I can't really see why the difference is so big. Bender seems quite bothered by Chomsky's piece. And it seems to be not just because of a disagreement in the mechanism of how humans understand the world. What am I missing? The difference here seems relatively small, since both are basically saying that ChatGPT doesn't have a mental understanding of the world.",

For example, the pronunciation of Chinese and Vietnamese surnames can depend on topolect, whether the person was brought up in an anglophone environment, etc, and the choice of spelling won't necessarily clarify it.\n\nWould it be so bad to request that everyone, regardless of name, provide a Broad IPA transcription of their names limited to the phonemic inventory available in the target language (in this case, English, but otherwise depending on the dominant language of the community in question)? I know that few are familiar with Broad IPA, but someone who is can ask for a person's name and transcribe it accordingly *once* (then read it back and ask for confirmation), and people in a position to recite a roster of names should familiarise themselves with the Broad IPA of the language they'll be speaking.",

From what I found they seem to be mostly found in French. In Old French we find it in a sentence in \"La Geste Francor\" or in modern French \"La feste Chandeleur.\" We also find Old French ancienor, crestienor, paienor. Even in Old Spanish I found \"fuero juzgo.\" Is there other examples in other Romance languages and more examples of this being used in French and Spanish I haven't found yet? And why did it survive and be used in this way we see when the genitive plural had been moribund as an ending for even a few centuries before Romance started being written down? Why didn't they just use the preposition \"de\" + normal plural Romance form instead of a dead fossilized ending like that in some rare instances like these above?",

        "text": "The Pirahã are a people in the Amazon rainforest with a rather peculiar language that is said to lack the ability to express numerical values (among other things). This might sound weird at first glance but the more I think about it, the more it kinda does make sense.\n\nLet's talk colors. So here are two shades of the color grey ([A and B](https://imgur.com/a/FFzdIjd)) but one is slightly darker than the other. What words would you use to describe the two colors ? A is dark grey and B is less dark grey ? Sure, but can you express the two colors in isolation ? As in without the need to refer to the other color ? Well I can speak Arabic, French and English, and neither of those three languages has the lexical inventory (at least in terms of daily words) to express that.\n\nNow let's imagine a hypothetical culture with a language where such a distinction can be expressed. Let's say a culture where their life entierly revolves around steelmaking to the point they developped the ability to think of 50 shades of grey in isolation from each other. Can you learn acquire that ability by learning their language ? Hypothetically yes, but it is extremely hard and close to impossible in practice to gain the ability to abstract those colors.\n\nThere are less extreme cases of this in the real world and color terminology is a very interesting subject you can check if you are more interested in the details of how languages acquire new words for different colors over time.\n\nNow to numbers. Did you ever encounter the number 871265 in your life ? Probably not. Now you are still able to think and express that number because you live in a society where it is neccesary to have the ability to express any sum of money no matter how large or small it might be. You can also abstract the concept of negative numbers as they have a benefit in allowing you to understand the concepts of debt.\n\nNow let's imagine a hypothetical society where society where money doesn't exist. This society instead is one of shepards. What numerical values would they need ? Let's say I have 21 sheep and I took them out to graze. Now I am back to my farm and oh no, I can only count 20 sheep, one must be missing!!\n\nWe can see the numerical values I need are 1- small 2- positive. I mean I don't owe anyone sheep, so why would I need negative numbers ? And even if I do, I can just express that with those small positive numbers. Same goes for large numbers, do I need the ability to express 871265 sheep ? I doubt there are that many sheep to begin with.\n\nFor a more real life example, the concept of negative numbers is rather recent, to the ancient Greeks the concept of 4x+20=4 was absurd. And the fact our words for large numbers are at the end of the day just derived from small numbers means at some point in history, most of our languages couldn't express those large numerical values either.\n\nNow to the Pirahã. They are a hunter-gatherer society with little to no contact with the outside world until very recently. And according to Everett, they are pretty succesful hunters and gatherers.\n\nAccording to Everett, they have two words to express numerical values, \"hói\" meaning \"small quantity\", and \"hoí\" meaning \"large quantity\". They have no numerical terminology in their language and they struggle to understand the concept.\n\nLet's think of that within their cultural context. Let's say person A and person B each bring two bags full of berries. Does it matter if one bag has 20 more berries than the other ? Probably not. The tribe is going to consume the contents of those bags and won't store them for a long period of time. Is there a need to have a distinction between a large quantity and a large quantity with 20 less berries ? In their context, no, the same way you don't need a distinction between those 50 shades of grey.\n\nNow according to Everett, the Pirahã were still able to see a clear distinction between different quantites. If you showed them a bag of 20 and a bag of 30 berries, they can see one bag has more berries than the other similar to how you can see the difference in shade between Grey A and Grey B above. But again, the ability to spot a distinction doesn't mean it is useful in your life, so you don't need the ability to express the difference of the two in isolation from each other.\n\nSo what do you think ? Do you see any flaws within my logic ?",

While I generally find it easy enough to hear and reproduce features of consonants, I find the features of vowels much more difficult. I can largely deal with lip-rounding, but for height and backness, I feel like I recognise them only by matching to vowels I already know, and having memorised where on the chart these vowels I know lie. For example, the way I understand GOOSE-fronting is that it makes /uː/ sound less like a true [u], but not any more like [o], so it must be moving away from [u] in the other dimension. I'm a native English speaker, so the vowel inventory of English acts as a very effective (though probably quite inaccurate) crutch.\n\nHow can I develop my phonetic understanding of vowels? Something I've seen before with music is quizzes which ask which of two similar tones has the higher pitch, or something like that, and maybe there could be a similar quiz for vowel features.",

        "text": "A dialect in Kannada drops the /h/ before any words that start with it. This is just a dialectical variation that occurred when, mostly, word-initial debuccalization occurred to the /p/ phoneme during the Middle Kannada stage. However, to this specific dialect it just dropped the /h/ phoneme as well.\n\nOne thing that does happen in this dialect is that, sometimes, speakers hypercorrect and so they add an /h/ phoneme where it doesn't belong. My question is: **would speakers of this dialect hypercorrect in certain scenarios where hypercorrection would result in a word that has negative connotations and would be considered rude? Or will certain scenarios cause them to be more conscious about their use of the word to not do so?**\n\nEx. /aːdara/ ādara (ಆದರ) = high respect/veneration            /haːdara/ hādara (ಹಾದರ) = adultery\n\nEx. sentence: if ādarada svāgata = A welcome with high respect. becomes hādarada svāgata = A welcome with adultery.\n\nI assumed that in such scenarios, they wouldn't hypercorrect because they would be more cautious. **Or is it hypercorrection something that happens unconsciously and thus cannot be stopped?**",

Likewise, both Smith and Čašule, who has his own competing hypothesis, acknowledge Holst's preceding work on the internal reconstruction of Burushaski to be valuable (though Munshi makes some critiques).\n\nHolst's main work on this seems to be a book that's not easy to track down, so basically I'm wondering if the work is credible enough to warrant the effort, even as a collection of possible Central Asian wanderworter.",

It amazes me that speakers of those languages could distinguish those sounds. How do you do that? \n\nI have already tried the \nHow spot\nHouse pot\nHouse bot\nexercises, and I still can't tell the difference when those phonemes are used in regular speech. It seems that the difference between a voiced consonant and its unvoiced unaspirated counterpart lies in the incredibly short time gap  when the plosive consonant is articulated, during which the vocal cords would be vibrating for a voiced one, and would not be vibrating for an unvoiced unaspirated one. I have recordings of Hokkien speakers for minimal pairs listening exercises, but I still can't reliably tell the difference.",

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

When I was in university, I used to use a program called Interlex to do this. Interlex was brilliant: you could build your own custom wordlists, and then it would quiz you on them until you have learned all the words. The winning feature was that it would automatically switch keyboard/language settings between the target language field and native language field. So if you e.g. were learning Greek, in the target language field, you would automatically be typing the word in the Greek alphabet, and then when you switch to the native language field to type the translation, it automatically switches back to English. See screenshot below for how it worked for Russian and Cyrillic to Roman. If you had to do this manually for each word, it would be insanely time consuming. \n\nUnfortunately, this keyboard switching feature of Interlex does not work on Windows 10, and the developer who made the program doesn't seem to have issued any updates in nearly 10 years. \n\nI've spent the last two hours googling a similar program, but I have only found vocabulary builder apps that come with pre-populated vocabulary lists which isn't what I need. I need to be able to build my own lists based on the material that I'm using to learn the language. \n\nDoes anyone know if there's anything like Interlex out there that works on newer operating systems?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4b8e8b0mena1.jpg?width=555&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5dda915ba1dbd356a2318b88a547e9c62c0864e4",

        "text": " About a year ago [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ubjbvc/what_are_the_earliest_known_records_of_people/) (whence I got this title from) received some amazing replies, most of them focusing on Latin ([Appendix Probi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_Probi)) and Greek ([The Trial of Vowels](https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/wl1/wl110.htm)).\n\nThis made me wonder, are there any other (early) examples of manuscripts or books containing similar complaints on how people were \"carelessly ruining speech\"? Perhaps examples from other language families like Slavic, Germanic or Celtic?",

        "text": "I am a native speaker of Cairene Egyptian Arabic. Despite living in Alexandria my whole life, I cannot speak Alexandrian Egyptian Arabic. AEA is almost dead here. No one can really speak it anymore other than the poor Alexandrians ( who also mostly speak Cairene Egyptian Arabic ). This situation is very similar to that of the Oïl languages in France. People who live in regions where these languages were spoken can mostly understand them, but can’t speak them. The same can be said here in Alexandria.\n\nI’ve heard stories of people from Cairo unable or having a hard time understanding other dialects like AEA and Port Saidi Arabic. There are also some grammatical differences between them.\n\nCan Egyptian Arabic be considered a group of Arabic dialects instead of a single language? I really fear for my country’s languages and dialects. Does anybody also know how to start a revival movement for AEA? \n\nThank you.\n\nAlso u/choosing_is_a_sign please stop removing my posts for “ Questions “ while other people keep asking questions that should be removed like my posts, but aren’t. Please treat me like the rest.",

Almost every Indo European language uses a variation of matr and pitr to mean Father or Mother be it Assamese or Portuguese. Like that, we can clearly see a lot of similarities between these languages. \n\nHowever, when it comes Sino Tibetan languages, I've noticed barely any similarities. Even though a large part of the reason is obviously because I can fluently speak 3 Indo European languages and understand many others while I can't speak any Sino Tibetan languages, even by observing certain words in different languages, I still don't find clear similarities. Forget the difference between Mandarin and Sino Tibetan language spoken in India, you barely see any similarity between two Sino Tibetan language in the same sub category, for example the Naga languages of Nagaland. I met a Naga person once and he told me that each language has a difference of Hindi and English. \n\nSo, my question is, what is the basis of this categorisation and how accurate is it?",
