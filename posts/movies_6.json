But when the movie started here in Portland it was out of focus for almost 10 minutes! \n\nNot sure if it takes that long to restarted an IMAX film or what but seeing the first few scenes terribly out of focus was an awful way to start. My wife has never seen it so her first time was hilariously in IMAX but that failed start was a rough intro! Even though it was our eyes I felt most badly for Daren who spent so much time revamping this for the anniversary.\n\nOnce they restarted it was bangin tho! The sound was in my marrow. Holy shit. Really amazing experience. So hoping more old classics get an update for IMAX! Was really pleased turnout was high so fingers crossed. ü§û",

The cameras might have been turned off, but I believe it may have been listening in. \n\nCould Colossus/Guardian be as formidable as HAL (*2001: A Space Odyssey*) in reading human inflections and expressions? Could it have suspected Forbin's lie about Cleo being his mistress? Or noticed  Cleo's made up story? \n\nI also have my doubts about the White House, but one might think they would know if they were bugged. What I did notice was that they spoke rather freely whist dialing out and waiting for the call to connect - certainly a time when Colossus/Guardian could have heard their plans. \n\nInitially (as a kid) I thought that Colossus/Guardian caught the slight-of-hand performed by the middle engineers. \n\nWhat do you think? Anyone have the book handy? Was it explained? I'm curious as to your theories and/or the author's explanation even though it was not in the movie.",

        "text": "May be a bit of a random question. Last night i ended up in an IMDB wormhole like I often do, and I ended up on Frank Grillos page. It seems that he has gone full Bruce Willis (pre dementia) and is just trying to be in as many crappy movies as possible. Now, I get it, he probably shows up on set for one or two days and gets paid a million dollars+. Do that 7-8 times a year and you are making a great living. Just weird that a guy who is still young is making these choices.  \n\n\nBut what is the deal with these films? Check out Grillos IMDB page and see what is upcoming. A lot of them have the same C and D list actors as co stars. Many have the same directors. And there is no way these films make money.\n\nAnd Grillo is catching strays in my post here, but its not just him. Movies like this are coming out weekly. Guys like Pachino, De Niro, and Morgan Freeman are even in them nowadays. Usually playing opposite some D lister or has been. They are clearly rushed and no thought is put into the writing. They are helmed by some rent-a-director and usually are based around some type of \"masculine\" plot line - terrorists, CIA, military, revenge,etc  \n\n\nThese types of movies come and go with no promotion and I cant imagine anyone pays for them on demand. So what is the deal here? My immediate thought is that the production companies behind these films have to be involved in some serious money laundering and use these \"legitimate\" films to do so. As a movie snob I hate it because they are kind of a stain on the movie culture and a waste of guys who could be doing better things (I love Grillo!) Am I missing something here or do people generally agree that there is probably some shady business going on behind the scenes to justify these movies getting made?",

Ever since her car trunk sparring session over Faye Dunaway films with George Clooney in 1998‚Äôs *Out of Sight*, Jennifer Lopez has been my celebrity crush.\n\nLopez‚Äôs portrayal of Karen Sisco calibrated scene-stealing swagger with layers of subtle humanity. Her Sisco was tough minded, but kind hearted. Driven, but playful. Effortlessly feminine, but just as at home in sweat shorts and a Dan Marino jersey as the designer skirt Clooney dirties in the trunk. The role was instrumental in her late ‚Äô90s ascension from supporting player to A-list superstar and winning my undying affections.\n\nAlas, Lopez‚Äôs latest, *Shotgun Weddin*g, is grounds for separation. The Amazon film dutifully compiles all of her worst filmic impulses, tosses them in a cinematic blender, and presses pur√©e....\n\nThe success of a rom-com rests almost exclusively on the shoulders of the stars; specifically the female lead.

I dare say this is probably the best slasher Jamie did after HALLOWEEN. PROM NIGHT sucked and Jamie barely does anything in it besides that horrendous disco dance.",

        "text": "Most reboots are unnecessary however I think the Fast series is just perfect for one. Somewhere along the way it lost touch of what it truly was, a movie about street racing and car modifying with a sprinkle of family. Now even though any hero and villain is currently able to be classed as ‚Äúfamily‚Äù the whole series has just gone crazier and wackier with every instalment. They are closer in genre to the Mission Impossible movies than the original F&amp;F movie, but unfortunately nowhere near the same in storytelling standards. \n\nSo imagine a whole new cast and crew on a reboot that takes the series back to its roots of street racing, car modifying, corruption and of course family. But scale it down to a lot smaller lower budget movie. Something a lot more gritty, closer to a crime thriller than the over the top blockbuster movies they currently are. Maybe something like Drive in tone but Baby Driver in pace. I‚Äôd even go as far to say they should take inspiration from classic games such as Midnight Club and Need for speed. But those are just my thoughts.\n\nThis is just one guys ramblings as I really did love the original movie. Fast Five was my second favourite but for different reasons. \n\nWhat would you like to see in a reboot and who would star?",

        "text": "A coworker showed me the Menu a few weeks ago and boy, have I gone down the rabbit hole on this one.  It is an amazing movie and I can't seem to get enough, between rewatches and watching deep dive videos, it left me with a few questions and thoughts I don't think I've heard other people talk about and I'd love to get other people's opinions.... \n\nThis whole post is all spoilers, can I not use spoiler bars?\n\nSpoilers also for Citizen Kane (1941)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. This came to me the other day.  I feel like it's a take on \"what would happen if Citizen Kane was a psychopath?\"\n   1. In Kane, the titular character's last dying breath was a reference to what,  we presume, was the last time he felt pure joy, his stolen childhood.  As he pushes farther into success and power, the only thing he really cares about is the sled he kept/found/obtained during his lifetime.  In \"The Menu\", Chef Slowik only makes an exception of his killing when he is reminded of something similar, his childhood's stolen joy of cooking and feeding people, that he kept a reference of (being an employee of the month) in his secret room.  Both also had loyal followers/patrons that did their will.\n2. Why does Tyler keep taking pictures of the food?\n   1. In the course of the film, we learn that Tyler knew everybody's fate months or at least days before the start of the film.  Why does he keep on taking photos? is it a habit? the film doesn't talk about him posting it on any social media so it's not for any immediate cred.  He HAS to know that any photos won't be shown to anyone.  Could it be that he's THAT much of a sycophant that can't stand NOT taking photos? Does he believe that they won't all die? (Like it's a joke like in Glass Onion?) \n3. The MovieStar/Assistant table, did he know as well? \n   1. This whole relationship strikes me as odd.  She's leaving him to pursue her career.  fine. They both know she's stealing, and they both know he wrote her a bad recommendation.  weird, but I'm assuming this happens irl, fine.  Why would she choose to leave at this super fancy restaurant ON AN ISLAND?? You do this at a bar or at least a classy restaurant where you can get up and go if things turn south.  You don't do it on an island where you can't leave FOR 4 HOURS!!?!?! Also, the last line he says is \"I told you, you weren't leaving\" ... did he know or was he just being cheeky, as in \"wow... I guess I was right\" \n4. what was the point of paying (and why did the magazine get it?)\n   1. They just act like it was a normal experience.  The husband pays for the wife, the publisher acts like it was a business dinner, and the finance bros just split it.  It still feels so weird that they even were charged and he makes a comment about how they shouldn't tip.  so weird \n5. Why Bring his Mom!?!?! Does she die? What's her sin?\n   1. The mom just seems like a drunk who gets brought along for the ride.  No sin on her part to make the dining experience terrible. Maybe it's because she started him down this path of trying to satisfy unsatisfiable people? Although we see her in the corner, never eating, only drinking.  Does she know the patron's/staff's fate beforehand? Nobody notices or reaches out to her during the course of the meal, except the chef in that tender moment right before and during the taco course.  She is also absent from the final course... I watched it a few times and can't seem to find a shot of the table or her .... where she's always in the background during every course.... just hanging out with a bottle/glass of wine. \n6. Thoughts on the ending\n   1. I've heard several theories about the fate of Margot/Erin.  From she actually dies soon after the movie because the meat is bad and will kill her to she \"won\".  I think it's a redemption for the chef.  Saying that he finally got what he wanted.... fed somebody who really enjoyed his food, who COULD be satisfied with her meal, and who ate something he truly enjoyed making.  How I take it is, she was so scared from the experience she stopped the boat on purpose once she got a good distance away where she felt safe and truly enjoyed the food so much she actually ate the burger in such a relaxed way. the way one does when on a picnic or relaxing with a good meal at home.  \n\nI'm sure others will come to me and I'll post them, but these are the 6 that have been racking my brain recently....  \n\nThoughts?",

Holly Hunter won almost every award there was to win, The Piano is a classic, she was always the frontrunner back then. \n\nIn Jamie Lee's case, fine, it was a career award but it's not the first time it happens and Jamie Lee Curtis campaigned hard for her win, not to mention she promoted the Best Picture winner like crazy. PR influences a lot. \n\nAngela Bassett has every right to be hurt, people should lay off her back over her giving the stink eye, but it's not cool the hate being directed at Jamie Lee Curtis.

        "text": "I know it's been three months since Christmas but whatever so I guess this is as good a time as any.  \n  \nJust hear me out. I wholeheartedly believe that **Shazam (2019) should be remembered as a throwback film**, and could be included as part of the rotation of christmas films in many family traditions.  \n  \n\nFirst of all, the film has the sincerity of 90's christmas movies. The whole plot revolves around Billy, who tried to find his family, and ended up finding the family he needed, but not exactly the one he searched for. Most of the humor comes from the absurdity of the situation, of a kid who somehow turned into a superpowered adult and all that it entails. The bad guy is not some misunderstood pariah, he may have experienced trauma but he is as bad as they come, and he doesn't get redemption at the end. Speaking of no redemption, I just wanna say that the villain may be bad, but the worst person in the film is someone with no superpowers. Those who watched the film knew who I mean.\n\n\nThere's a heartfelt scene lost on many superhero films nowadays, about Billy overhearing his foster parents say that it's Billy's choice to call their house a home, but they will still give him a place full of love regardless.  This scene resonated with me since I moved 700 miles to college while seeing this film in theatres, and this film taught me that even if my biological family is hundred of miles away, I can still find a family in college that could help me through the hard times, and luckily, I did.\n  \n\nOf course, like the old classics there is an out-of-place [horror scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB2bRJ2jvPM) that just pops out of nowhere just like 80's and 90's flicks and is surely to be removed from movies aimed to kids nowadays. The best thing is that the horror scene directly follows the heartfelt scene I just recalled abovd, so audiences would definitely be surprised by the sudden change in tone (and remembering the shouts of the people around me, they definitely did).\n  \nAnd... that's it. I don't want to spoil a film that released only four years ago, so watch it on your own time and tell me if you agree. Shazam (2019) is so precious a movie to bundle it with the other grimdark films of the DCEU, and it could definitely be watched standalone without watching any other DCEU film.  \n  \nI also forgot to say, but even if the movie is released on April 2019 the film is wholly set in christmas. That's why I said it could be included in the christmas rewatches families havs. They even add lights to the christmas tree in one scens, and the whole movie takes place in wintery Toronto (which plays wintery Philadelphia)",

They use such cheap tricks to throw the audience's suspicion off. but later they reveal that the same guy is plotting with villains all along. what fk? how does that even make sense from a storytelling perspective to show us a scene where an evil guy pretends to be a good guy even when they are alone with the villain?\n\nit's not just movies, tv shows also do that. i just don't understand it.
