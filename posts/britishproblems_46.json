I have notes about the delays and full strike info on every listing, in my shop, and I send the same to everyone after their order is posted so they know when to expect it in case they somehow missed it. There are multiple other non-RM courier delivery options available, but everyone just goes for the second class RM. \n\nPeople are opening and escalating cases on eBay, which are being settled entirely in their favour despite tracking details showing exactly where their parcels are. I can't claim this back from Royal Mail of course, as the tracking shows they are still in transit. The buyer is getting the item free, a full refund, and I'm losing out on the postage that can't be claimed back. \n\nI only make around ¬£4.5k/yr, so I'm not exactly rolling in it. Certainly not to the point where eBay can just hand over an entire month's takings plus some to people who are still getting their item anyway. \n\nToday I had one opened by someone who is \"very unhappy\" demanding a refund because their parcel (paid for second class, posted on Friday) hasn't arrived yet. This is the only one I'm confident I'll actually get somewhere with, because that's just mental. Etsy are at least reviewing cases manually, sadly that's a very tiny percentage of sales. \n\nJust needed to vent, sorry.",

But I really don't need the radio trying to make me feel excited and peppy and zingy and everything else. I am none of those things at 7:30am, and the constant noise, chatter and telling me \"we all love such and such\" makes me less and less likely to do so. There are tons of commercial radio stations doing that kind of show at breakfast, give me something a bit different. It's the radio equivalent of someone desperately trying to make you have fun, which just makes you exasperated and even more grumpy.\n\nTerry Wogan was perhaps the only radio presenter who understood that some people need gently easing into the day, without being shouted at first thing or having to listen to people arguing about inconsequential stuff. They should just replay past shows of his, including the news, weather and travel reports, just to confuse people (oh and that's another thing, the desperate attempts to turn Richie Anderson into a \"personality\" - aaagh!).\n\nAnd before anyone says \"just don't listen\", my wife seems to control access to the radio where we have meals and she likes Radio 2. It goes off as soon as she's gone to work.\n\n(Jay's quiz on a Thursday morning is pretty good, though, apart from that time when David Walliams turned up and ruined it.)",

        "text": "Recently rendered unable to drive for medical reasons. Still have to be in the office two days a week. Worked out that it's as expensive to stop in a cheap chain hotel near work for a night as it is to commute back home and up again by train and bus, but obviously much less travel time (without any further fuckery from Industrial Action or Xmas anyway).\n\nI let slip this fact at work, cue every one else who can drive expressing their disbelief and there's no way I can be right. Have to do the maths with them in a group chat before they believe me. Does everyone just think buses are 40p like they were when they were a kid? Assuming they even go where you want them to! My journey if able bodied would be *walk up a steep hill to a bus stop* bus into the city, train, then 2 more buses. About 90mins if everything turns up on time. Versus 40mins driving up mostly on the motorway. In practice walking from my house to a bus stop is a steep hill at least the first leg of that would be a taxi.\n\nBoss is going to 'review my situation' in the new year. If I don't find a fully remote job first. And fuck any clever clogs who just says \"lol go on benefits\" or \"just find a new job?\" (I've been told both)",
