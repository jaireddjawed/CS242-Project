I'm Chris, the developer of a game called 20XX.\n\nSix years ago, I quit a solid-but-boring job to blow all my savings trying to build some Megaman-inspired dreams. 20XX was on Steam Early Access for approximately 300 years, and finally graduated last August. Thankfully, the game did well, and we got to work bringing our game to modern consoles. Our work comes to fruition today - 20XX is available on Nintendo Switch and PS4 now, and will be available at midnight UTC (around 8PM today) on Xbox One.\n\nTo celebrate, I'd love to answer ALL QUESTIONS.\n\nSo, AMA about 20XX, life as an indie, developing on consoles, jumping/shooting/riding on cars, or anything else! I'll start answering questions at 3pm EST.\n\nproof: https://twitter.com/batterystaple_g/status/1016749819430391808",

        "text": "**My short bio:** In 2016 I almost died from the swine flu. It started April 4th, after my moms birthday. I got a bad headache, took a motrin and went to college. When I got home, I suddenly got the chills, and declined from there. On April 6th, with a 104.5 fever, my brother and I decide to go to the hospital. I stay over night and everything was fine, but mid- morning the next day I suddenly couldn't breathe. 15 minutes later a bunch of doctors and nurses with bags full of tubing and needles come in and one doctor tells me they dont know what's going on but my lungs are failing so there going to induce a coma. \n\nIt's been 2 years since then. That fall after I got sick, I went back to college, but I noticed when I'd go up a flight of stairs my heart rate would go up to 120bpm. I just thought it was because I was out overweight. well fast forward to may of this year, and after having a cold, my blood oxygen suddenly started dropping and it was hard to breath so I called an ambulance. When I got to the hospital my blood oxygen was down to 77%, and normal oxygen wasnt working so they gave me a bypap machine and they kept me for four days(one day in the ICU). The pulmonologist said there was liquid around my lungs, so they gave me lasex, and everything got better, except my heart rate. Now my heart rate is constantly around 115 bpm and when I walk it spikes up to 130-140bpm. I did a follow up with a pulmonologist and after studying my case for almost an hour he concluded that my lungs are severely damaged from the ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), from when I got sick, and that my lungs had almost \"no line of defence left\". He said that he wanted me to get test done and that from here on out when I get sick in going to have to be treated aggressively like I'm a stage 4 COPD patient. The high heart rate is due to the lungs not working to their full capacity. He said that I can no longer exercise like a normal person can. I have a follow up with the pulmonologist at the end of July to see what the next steps are. That's where I am. Ask Away\n\n**My Proof:** \n\n[Me - 2018](https://i.imgur.com/2N0ftBv.jpg)\n[ICU - May 2018](https://i.imgur.com/bHM6Qkd.jpg)\n[Swine Flu - 2016](https://i.imgur.com/ahsWGZo.jpg)",

Some of our songs have been featured in some of the biggest clubs in the US and in over **150** **clubs around the world** including V Live in Detroit and the Vaskeriet in Norway. We've been operating for a little over a year, since right after I graduated Highschool, (I kept telling people I was making a label senior year). I started producing music around 15, but I'm not nearly as talented at it as others, and I always saw myself as more of a business man than an artist, so I wanted to get into the music business.\n\nI've met with some of the most notorious DJ's and some great managers as well as the manager for lil yachty, famous dex, cuban doll, Kyle, etc. All very friendly people\n\nOur social media presence isn't the strongest, but my rappers have been doing shows around the US, and have their own socials where their music is. One of my best friends of all time from highschool, someone else who cuts their teeth in music production, Scott, agreed to start a podcast with me where we review rap albums and share our opinions. Our Podcast is called \"The Scxtt &amp; Andre Show\" and we dont have many views yet, but also I havent done any promo. We recently had our first guest, an LA rapper named Kev Decor who has over a million streams on spotify on soundcloud and he's going places, and we'll be having some more cool guests in the near future as well. Our podcast can be found on Soundcloud, iTunes, Google Play music, and Stitcher and soon to be on spotify, and my instagram is @viewtifulmedia.\n\nBut all of our social links are on our website so check it out. And if you follow our soundcloud you can listen to me make crappy jokes on our podcast so thats a plus.\n\nUmm I'll be turning 19 soon. I love snowboarding, dancing, playing checkers. Breaking bad and its always sunny in philadelphia and black mirror are my favorite shows. Sometimes I have good hair days..other days I don't. I think I made one of these posts last year but I was in a weird mood and deleted it lol. Ask me anything?",

Their first game [Eureka!](http://www.mobygames.com/game/eureka)  was published in 1984. It was designed by Ian Livingstone and developed  in Hungary. The mystery puzzle game was played on early home computers,  such as the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum. They offered a £25,000  prize for the first person to complete Eureka in its first year.During the following years, Domark secured licenses for several  well-known IPs including Trivia Pursuit, James Bond, and Star Wars,  again using outside companies to do the programming for them. In October  1995 the entire Domark conglomerate was acquired by Eidos, along with  several other companies. Wheatley served as CEO of Eidos until 1997. He  set up Eidos US office in San Mateo and launched Tomb Raider at E3 in LA  in ’96. Wheatley is currently the CEO of Catalis SE and Curve Digital  Entertainment.\n\nProof: [https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6414253550821527552/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6414253550821527552/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nIf you would like to watch the GDC video game documentary Moleman 4 - Longplay, about the development of Eureka! produced by Domark and about other well-known games from the '80s and '90s check:  [https://moleman4.com](https://moleman4.com/)\n\nYou can also find the whole interview with Dominic Wheatley among the extras.\n\nDuring the Big GameDev AMA Series get Moleman 4 and all the extras at a 64&amp;#37; OFF - $4.99 (Original price: 13.8$)\n\n[https://vimeo.com/ondemand/moleman4dev](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/moleman4dev)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* EDIT \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDominic Wheatley just let us know that he is on mobile and the signal seems to be a bit week.

So, I decided that since that was a two year old ama, I would do a new one!\n\nI used to work at HEB (and technically still do lol), a texas based grocery store chain. We are known for famous coupon pairings (like buy a pint of ben and jerrys, get cookie dough free on valentines day) and the texas themed products we sell (such as texas shaped tortilla chips, texas shaped cheese, etc).\n\nI don't work at HEB right now, I go to college out of state where no HEB's are (which is sad), and I'm back in texas persuing a internship this summer, which doesn't leave much time for working there. HEB has insanely changed over the last year (at least at my old store), and it's crazy to see.\n\nI'm doing this ama today since I'm insanely bored so feel free to ask whatever questions you have on grocery stores, heb, food, or anything!\n\nI have proof on the AMA from two years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4d4t5i/i_work_for_the_texas_grocery_chain_heb_ama/?st=is0xmt7d&amp;sh=1b786928\n\n(if I need more proof, please let me know!)\n\nand here is the country living article I was referenced on (lol): https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/a42941/heb-grocery-shopping-tips/ ",

He had SCID.\n\nIn easy terms? My T-cells don't function and I can't fight off life threatening illness or infections! Woot woot. :P \n\nIt took me years to get a proper diagnosis and I'm finally receiving treatment that will help with 2 of my immune deficiencies. It's called Immunoglobluin (IG) which is from plasma donated from people like you (go you!). It takes about 1000 people to donate plasma for just one of my treatments. I get infusions once a week.\n\nPI is rare from lack of awareness and testing. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about Primary Immune Defeciency, my story, ect.\n\nHere is from more info on PI: http://i66.tinypic.com/t86srs.jpg\n\n*Also, if you feel inclined, I am also raising awareness and funds for my campaign to WALK for PI! \nhttp://events.primaryimmune.org/site/TR/Events/General?px=1023257&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1296\n\n**My Proof:**: http://i66.tinypic.com/2sb9ylw.jpg",
