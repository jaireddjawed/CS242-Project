I like vidoegames, they've been with me since my very early childhood. Since i started to feel that i cant stand sitting and just working in front of my editing station, because i am fed up with using computer from last nights gaming session, i have choosen to take my laptop and leave it at the office, and having my phone connected to the monitor using samsung dex as a \"laptop replacement\" for light internet use so this way i would not be exposed to the usagr of computer without reasonable intent to do and looking at this as an oppurtunity to get interest in less dopamine driven activities such as book reading. \n\nAnyone has done anything similiar?

        "text": "So, a little bit of background on me. I like to believe that I am a normal guy. I like to believe that I carry myself with a certain amount of dignity and respect. However, I have had my share of failures. In college I had my first girlfriend who I loved and thought that we were going to get married one day. Yet, things ended up in a ball of fire. I had friends but they had their own things to worry about so they hung out with her more than me. I then thought I recovered and found another girl. She was a sweet girl however, she had a drug addiction and a cutting habit. I bought her a rabbit and she ended up attacking the person I adopted it from. That is when I started closing myself off from the world. I shut myself in my room for 2 years not eating watching Netflix at times but mostly sleeping. Until I was pulled out of my slump by a girl I met on bumble. I am forever grateful to her. She and I went on hikes, hung out with her family, and she showed me what it meant to be in a wholesome relationship. Unfortunately, I realized that my mental state was hurting her. She didn't realize it but I viewed the world in a negative way and a couple of times I made her cry without realizing what I did. She was away at college and she needed to study but my toxic attitude hurt her. Everytime I made her cry I tried to figure out why. I started thinking I was becoming a monster. So, I left I broke up with her a week after her birthday. I wanted to make sure she received her birthday gift. Since she celebrated my birthday.I saw a mental health professional and realized that I am not a monster just a clueless man. Since then I have stagnated just waiting around and not interacting with anyone. I had no drive however, I have started to go to the gym and practice Spanish. 2 things it is not much but I hope to focus on my mind and body. So, I guess watch out world because I am on my way to become a useful member of society. I will not be special just your average normal guy someone who is like everyone else. If you are wondering why make something like this public. Well simple I don't have much in the form of a social support network since I have spent 5 years locked in my room. I missed a lot of life but I am excited to start living again.",

        "text": "Most people live inside the comfort zone. It’s warm, comfortable, safe and you live a life with very little risk. For some people it’s where they should stay.\n\nI have spent most of my life on the cross-over between comfort zone and the fear zone.\n\nThe Fear Zone is in fact the Dead Zone and if one spends long periods here then the comfort zone's powerful allure pulls you back into safety where you’ll extend your stay before venturing out again.\n\nHowever, for those that make it past the Fear Zone the grass really is greener on the other side. It's where learning and growth truly happens.\n\nBut it takes courage, discipline and intention to get there. \n\n## The Snooze Button Epidemic\n\nMillions of people will wake up Monday morning and hit the snooze button savouring every single minute they can under the covers.\n\nAnd why wouldn’t they? It’s warm, comfortable and safe. The crème de la crème of the comfort zone. \n\nBut something else is happening here, consciously or unconsciously there is a fear of the alarm clock and what it represents - You have to face it all again. \n\nIt might be going to a job you hate, an addiction you battle, a mental illness you have or even just a lack of purpose in life and by hitting the snooze button it gives you those final few minutes safe from your troubles and worries.\n\nBut hitting the snooze button is a coping mechanism, an avoidance strategy that you, again unconsciously or consciously, have adopted into your way of life. You fear what the day will bring. \n\nFor others, hitting snooze is a way of procrastinating. You might be trying to build a business, start a bakery cooking Youtube channel, lose weight, or achieve some other positive goal you have. But you fear what might happen if things don’t start going your way. Or more oddly, you fear what will happen if things do start going your way! \n\nLiving in fear you’ll make excuses, wallow in self-pity, be scared of opinion and lack confidence in yourself and those emotions all manifest themselves into tapping that snooze button.\n\n## Overcoming the Dread of Waking Up Early\n\nIt’s always easier to wake up in the morning when you have a ‘why’. A sense of direction and purpose will drag you out of bed in the morning. But for millions their purpose has eluded them. They dread getting out of bed and facing it all again. This simple 5 step introspection can helped me to overcome the dread of getting up early and it can help you too: \n\n#### Listen\n\nBegin listening to your inner voice, most of the time it will tell you what you’re fearful of. Listen to your first thought of the day. If you’re a snoozer it’s probably the first excuse of the day. Listen and capture those thoughts. \n\n#### Identify\n\nSometimes you think you’re fearful of something but in fact you’re scared of something else. For example, you might think you’re scared of failure so you don’t try. In fact, you are scared about what other people will think about you if you fail. Once you start recognising those fears you can plan to take action against each one. \n\n#### Reflect\n\nWrite down your excuses. Reflect on why you have those fears. Put yourself under the spotlight. Separate the real fear from the perceived fear. \n\n#### Accept\n\nRecognise and accept those fears. They are a part of your psyche today, but they don’t have to be tomorrow. Fear is the most powerful emotion in existence. It can save your life or cause you to lose everything you own. Get comfortable owning those fears. \n\n#### Goals\n\nSet some small but achievable goals that confront those fears. You’re not trying to beat your fears. Instead you are creating momentum every day to do things in spite of those fears until eventually you grow and you leave those fears behind.\n\n## Reinvention with Intention\n\nI am convinced you can entirely reinvent yourself in 12-24 months. The person you are today can be a distant memory and you can become whoever you want to be. But we have to step out of the comfort zone and into the fear zone before we ever begin to experience life in the learning zone and growth zone.",

        "text": "06/03/2023\n\n**Ever felt unnoticed? Or so awkward that people just gloss over you?**\n\nWell this is common for many people, including myself, and is something I'm still trying to work through. There maybe a plethora of reasons you are like this, and there isn't 1 definite reason for everyone. \n\n. Being bullied\n\n. Not getting out of your comfort zone\n\n. Not understanding your own self worth\n\nAmong many more possibilities. For me it's all of the above. But the main factor is not having any self belief. I will constantly tell myself I'm not good enough, and that people wouldn't want to talk to me simply because I'm me. That I would have to 100% fix all my problems for people to be ok with talking to me. A big thing for me is my awkwardness, I am extremely awkward in social situations that aren't with my friends and its very visible. And that's just me being in my own head overthinking situations and making myself awkward and invisible. I have gotten better at this recently by, not fixing the awkwardness but rather embracing it and being calm about it so it doesn't affect me very much in the moment. Also getting out of my comfort zone and talking to people I usually wouldn't has helped me get new social skills and made social interactions much easier, so as much as you may not want to, getting out there is the only way to fix your problems. So rather than constantly thinking about your problems and feeling horrible about yourself for having them, accept them and do something about them, get out of your comfort zone, because acting is the only way to really start solving your problems, no matter how uncomfortable it may make you feel to do so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo always remember, everyone's different, some people are just social butterfly's and other find it hard to get a word out, that's just how it is. But don't let that affect you, and make you feel like you aren't good enough. Just realise that you're good enough, and that image that you have of yourself in your head of how other people see you isn't real. You can get help from a friend, parent, teacher, or anyone you trust, or go and make progress on your own if you're able to, but don't ever give up and be content with yourself when you can be better.\n\nI hope this helped at least 1 person\n\nBye Bye now.\n\n\\-Ismealiemeal",

In my life, I've went through all kinds of bullshit. Family, friend, life related, you name it.\n\nBut I think at this point, my brain has developed a \"defense mechanism\" to keep me from being in a state of vulnerability ever again. But I've noticed something. The littlest things would tick me off. \n\nThe biggest things would tick me off too, but those little things would get me. Oh, a friend looked at me weird and wanted to stop talking? Oh, it's not her being in a bad mood, it's her secretly hating me and wanting to hang out with better friends. Oh, your teacher cut you off during your presentation? Probably because he hates you and thinks of you as beneath him. Not because he wants others to get a chance. Oh, your manager seems a little less nice today? Probably gonna get fired, and then you won't have a job, and then you'll be running around trying to get another one. \n\nOr, oh, you're getting into an argument with someone? You gotta prove them right and not let them win. If you let them win, they'll just do whatever they want with you, so you gotta  put them in their place. They clearly want to win or gain something from you, it's not that they had an argument or disagreement, it's that they wanted to be bigger than you and see you lose.\n\nI don't know what this is called, but I recently started realizing I have a problem with it. Whatever that thing is. It has made me want to shut everyone down in an argument, made me want to quit jobs, end friendships, and it's toxic. I think I'm constantly seeing myself as some sort of woe is me victim.\n\nAnd I don't want a cure all answer. I just want to know where I can start so I can drop this attitude. Its not gonna help me in the long run at all. \n\nI want to stop feeling constantly on the defensive and on the attack. And to those who say \"just ask yourself is it worth it\" I tried that tactic. And I find myself thinking, yeah it's not worth it, but if I let the argument go, then I worry that they'll feel satisfied that they won and I \"lost\".

        "text": "I (24M) feel like I am losing my manhood and everything I used to be and know about being a man. I have a family which consists of my gf (23f) and our 4yr old daughter with dogs. We currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment that we split with our friend (24f) and her daughter. Over the years I felt as I was losing my confidence in a lot of thing I used to do. I was very social with everyone and was sort of the life of the party whenever I went out. I drank, smoked, bought girls back home (before i had my gf and child) with my friends and after a night of partying hard I was still able to get up and go to work at 7am and pull 10 hr shifts with little to no sleep and hungover. Nowadays I get a little better sleep and have a great paying career but I am just lacking in all the other things. I am more introverted, I can barely hold a conversation with someone new, i am very awkward now and not confident in anything I do. Whether its working out, trying to stay motivated other than a paycheck keeping me alive, I cant perform in sex the way I used too.. I just feel as I cannot do anything right as a man. I do not know what to do or how to even help my self anymore..",

Everyday is the same, I keep trying to introspect and analyze myself and keep trying to improve myself and been doing this for almost 3 years and all this was due to a bullying incident that traumatized and triggered an extreme emotional stress and anxiety. I haven’t been the same since and now I feel I have to analyze my past and my behavior and all that because I feel my past behavior is questionable and that all my life I felt different and strange and want to see what’s the cause of that. \n\nI’m in first year in college and it’s all terrible and I know the one thing that seems to be the only cure and primary factor is confidence. for some reason, I think confidence is the answer to my problems but I feel that it can’t be due to the fact that it doesn’t correlate to my past behaviors and actions and I feel I can’t allow myself to be confident and love myself. \n\nI don’t know what to say.

That's just too much change overnight, my body isn't used to that. Instead, **I would start off by going to the gym twice a week, then up it to three then four, and eventually six. While I do that, I will slowly start changing my diet.** \n\nAnother example was reading. Many people struggle with reading for long periods of time. So, instead of committing to an hour of reading each day, start off with ten minutes then slowly build it up to an hour. \n\nI hope you guys get what I am trying to say. Making big changes overnight won't help your habits stick, it will only make it harder. Start off small then slowly build it up to the desired amount.",

        "text": " \n\nJust a warning, this might end up being long. I was doing a lot of thinking and I had to share it with someone lol.\n\nI'm M22. For most of my youth I was bullied. And it wasn't the traditional bullying. I was basically the butt of all the jokes from \"friends\" and I just took it because I didn't want to seem confrontational and cause drama. That probably was from when I was 11-17. Every name under the sun, I've been called ugly more times than I can count. Skinny, short, weak etc. etc.\n\nI took all of that and internalized it. I pretended I didn't care, and I think me feeling like shit became my new normal. Thought I was just some tiny ugly loser and that was whatever, losing my virginity at 17 didn't change my thoughts either as the girl ended up hooking up with another one of my friends within the week.\n\nSo I didn't care about anything. Fast forward 5 years. I had just graduated college and my actual friends and family had begun to jokingly pester me about when I'd get a gf. The only relationships I'd had were a \"girlfriend\" at age 11 for 2 months. A few school dances and hooking up with one of those girls. That got me thinking, why don't I? I've never really had any issue making woman friends. Sure I'm socially anxious but I'm like that with everyone.\n\nAfter thinking about it I determined that it was because I unknowingly had a dogshit self image and I didn't want to be made fun of like I did in my youth, so asking someone out wasn't even a thought that crossed my mind. I had read many stories of women being rude to people they didn't find attractive. Some of my good friends had told me to try out tinder in late 2021, guess I had bad pics but at the time I thought that was confirmation that I was an ugly loser.\n\nAfter I graduated college most of my friends moved to other cities, I had cut off all my toxic friends from my youth. My friends from college didn't live where I lived. So I basically had to restart my social circle from scratch.\n\nThat was May of 2022. It was horrible at the start, I felt pathetic, lonely etc. but I tried to put myself out there a bit more. Meet new people.\n\nFast forward to now and I think I'm finally starting to see the light. I'm on a soccer team, taking a break because I've been very busy with job stuff but I met some great people through that. I'm on a casual bowling team, we just won the league. I go out with a group of people I met through one of my bowling teammates weekly.\n\nNot once did any of these people make fun of my body, my face, my style. It never happens. In fact the only comments on me have been positive. Great beard, smell good, nice hair etc.\n\nSo why do I sit here with my horrible self image and think I'm weird, ugly etc.? There's no benefit. Why would I do that to myself. It's like I'm looking at my own thoughts from a different point of view. Hell I think I actually look good now, my friends in my youth just knew I would not fight back so I was an easy target.\n\nAs the title suggests I think I'm ready to fully begin my journey of freeing myself from my toxic mindset about myself, forget about my past, live in the moment, enjoy life. And I'm still practically a baby adult lol, it hasn't even been a full year since I graudated college.\n\nAfter a long time trying I'm finally returning to therapy next week. I'll definitely need the help but I think I'm finally ready to start loving myself. To start I thought about where I was 4 years ago. I have a chronic stomach condition. At that point I was 5'9\" 115 pounds. I could almost never eat without puking. Now I finally have that somewhat managed and I've been able to bring myself up to 160 lbs. Not muscle but I have an average body now vs looking like I came out of a month long fast lol.\n\nI'm so excited to become a better man, no one wants to deal with someone riddled with insecurities. And don't get me wrong, they're still there. But I think I understand where they come from now. So it'll be easier for me to cope with them in a healthy way instead of self loathing. I have a lot of work to do. But I'm excited to see the new me.\n\nThanks for reading, Ik that was long. If anyone reading this has had similar journeys I'd love to hear about them.",

        "text": "I see a lot of other people like myself proud of working 2 jobs and going to college part time because they will be bored.  That is what they value.  They want success.  They want  money.  They want a house.  A significant other.  To be known for something.  To be independent.  To meet like minded people.  And I completely understand where they are coming from.  -\n\nI don't think I have ever been that way.  I remember having a friend who encouraged me to take 5 classes at once when I was in college while I was already working 24 hour a week.  I never enjoyed it.  I get the mindset though \" you got to pay the bills\" \"no pain, no gain\". \n\nI guess it is my current situation.  I am able to work 32-40 hours ( mostly 32 hours ) a week at Trader Joes.  It is a job for the most part that i enjoy.  I love interacting with my co workers.  I like how stress free the job is. I get to do all of this while living in an apartment.  I play my favorite video games. I recently played Dead Space 1 remaster while smoking some weed today and I absolutely loved it. I read books that I am interested in.  I look up Youtube videos that peek my interests.  Today, I literally drank some iced coffee while staring at the rain outside my apartment window. It was so peaceful. I watched how the iced rain hit the roof of the apartment next to me.  And I loved every moment.  \n\nI love my free time.  The time i get off from any work or obligation that I have to do including errands.  i love every second of it.  And I don't understand people who have this motivation to always be working.  My brother for example, a respected mechanical engineer, has a kid, has a dog, he has to take care of the dog and the kid on his free time, do errands, work on his E40, works 40 hours a week, he has very little free time to him self.  I fucking hate that. I would hate living that way.  I know most people do but it must suck.  I love being alone.  i love the free time i get alone with no one to bother me.  I feel like other people just bring bullshit into this world that is not even necessary.  I love going out and hiking too with nature by myself.  Also peaceful.\n\nI love exploring more music.  I got to the gym daily before work.  One day I do cardio the next weights. The only motivation I have is to find more hobbies.  I want to take a yoga class for example and try that out.\n\nIs this a bad mindset to have?  Should I even do anything to change it?  And how should I understand others who want to grind much more than i do?  I just don't understand the mentality.  I am pretty sure it is a suffer now so you are allowed to do other stuff in the future mentality.  But i never want to actually suffer.  I want to enjoy everything.  Maybe if i was put in a circumstance, I might grind my way up to where I am now.  But i would absolutely hate it. \n\nAlso, does this come from a place of privledge?",

        "text": "Hi folks\n\nI'll jump right into it. I've struggled with abuse of my ADHD medication for a long time now. I have a psych whom is too ready and eager to prescribe, and open to your own suggestions too. Case in point, I take Mydayis--16 hr version of adderall. Maximum FDA approved dose is 50mg. I am prescribed 150mg. 90 pills a month. I'm only supposed to take 125mg a day. This leaves me with 15 extra pills a month, which have stockpiled overtime and I regularly take extras. Plenty of occasions I've taken around 200+ mg a day, have probably done worse in the past especially when I used to combine it with ephedrine.\n\nNow the whole reason I had to be prescribed so much was that I abused it to the point where a 'normal' dose wouldn't work, of course any time I had access to extras or could find a way to get them I did. The reason I get a 90 count each month but only for 125mg is because under my insurance, a 30 day supply of the medication maxes out at $70 OOP. So I would've been paying $70 for the 60ct 50mg, and $70 for the 30ct 25mg. I realized if I were prescribed 90ct 50mg, it would still only be $70--AND I realized this was the perfect way to finally have constant easy access to extras. You see the way I've learned to manipulate this in my favor.\n\nThis all mainly stemmed from some eating disorder stuff which I struggle with immensely, I'm a 5'10 male and recently in December got all the way down to 122lbs, a drop from the 140 I was back in June. A lot of that dropped after I had COVID in June but still.\n\nWell this excess of medication and maintaining this high a dose of this med was always reliant on me having a good healthcare plan. I knew that somehow, inevitably someday this would have to end somehow, but I wasn't going to stop it myself unless something forced me to.\n\nSo you see this coming April I'm losing my current healthcare and will have to go onto one of the many exclusively shitty marketplace options. My medication is not covered, and no quantity of any of the amphetamine based ADHD meds that would be equal to what I take now is going to be covered.\n\nI will admit I cried talking on the phone to the insurance company when I had the situation explained to me. I looked at every possible avenue to make it so I didn't have to stop this.\n\nThen I kind of realized I had two roads ahead of me. I was being presented a situation that could finally break me out of this, force me to have to detox from the med and have a clean slate to restart with an ADHD medication and do it the right way, and then my life could maybe finally move on from this.\n\nOr, I could fight with the insurance company and find a way to keep getting this amount of medication. But then I had the discovery that if I'm fighting for this to continue, that says that I am choosing to continue living my life this way--putting this much effort to keep getting all this medication is my saying this is what I want my life to be like.\n\nThat thought was kind of chilling. Led to some honest discussion with my family about whats been going on the past couple years and the reality of what likely is ahead of me.\n\nThe basic plan is sometime around April-May we're setting aside a month to either send me to a detox facility, or do it at home with my family. I've read some of what could be in store and I'm nervous. And I'm nervous about what life is going to be like. I'm scared of what my emotional state will be like with the way I have likely ruined my dopamine levels. Its a lot.\n\nSo...all that now said, theres an aspect of this that I needed advice on, which is my job.\n\nI have worked as a nanny for the past three years, it has been a blessing of a job and I've gotten to work with wonderful families. My current family, however, is the result of a compromise I had to make because I was desperate to find my next job last summer, and for the first time ever was having difficulty finding one.\n\nI'm currently working with the most kids I've had to work with, taking on the most responsibilities I've ever had to take on as a nanny---most of which have almost nothing to do with the kids---and with the least pay I've received.\n\nAdd onto this the mother, whom up until recently was my main point of contact, was horrifically mentally and emotionally damaging to me when I started. There was an understanding when I began that there were certain responsibilities, like cooking, that I'd never done before and would need guidance/teaching, which there was. But then, in what I'll just put in basic terms, what followed was my discovering that no matter what something I did was always wrong, how I shouldn't be anxious about having enough time to get my work done because I am given three hours to do work that took other nannies only one hour and they had more than I did, and she just has ridiculous standards and ideas and CLEARLY seems to think I'm a complete idiot. Idk its too much to explain. I tried to explain to them/her early on when this started to become an issue that I have ADHD and as such jobs with so many intricate moving parts like the insane amount of things they have me doing are difficult for people like me, so it takes me more time. They seemed to understand at first but then she quickly went back to how she was. And knowing I struggled with what I already had to do, at the beginning of the year she added an entire block of new tasks to somehow fit into the week which resulted in my very clearly having a stressful and upsetting week, with her being clueless to what the cause was. As a result, ever since then, they've reduced the amount they have me work more and more.\n\nI was fine working my full hours each day once I got into a set routine, where I knew exactly how to get everything done and that I COULD get everything done, and knew how each day was going to work and move. I had gotten to that point, but she almost somehow seemed bothered by my needing things to be set this way---its clear she can't understand how or why I struggle with any of this, hence why she adds tasks, then when I struggle more--rather than realize what may have caused it, the decision is instead made to cut back my hours. I'm down 10 entire hours per week from when I started.\n\nThis job and this woman have destroyed my self confidence and taken a massive toll on my mental health. I have had crying fits at this job several times, my anxiety has reached a level I've not experienced in years...I started experiencing a new symptom regularly that I'd never had before--the chest tightness and having a hard time breathing and feeling like no matter what you couldn't get a deep enough breath in, like your chest/lungs couldn't expand enough. This would last several hours almost every day of the week. I dread going into work every Monday and having this woman be home and coming in and somehow finding something I'm doing wrong. I had to start an antidepressant because of how I was feeling trying to work this job.\n\nThe husband, for the record, is absolutely wonderful. I've wanted to try and talk to him separately about these issues so I could explain exactly why I struggled and some of the things his wife has said to me, but I don't know if that would work or even go over well. I just think she fundamentally cannot understand me.\n\nSo I have this detox ahead of me, which is going to likely be hell and it may take me a long time to even emotionally function afterward. I'm going to have to be out of work during this period as working will be impossible during the detox period.\n\nI'm struggling with something that I want to do but feel anxious about because of my finances.\n\nI don't want to spend the weeks leading up to this being miserable and a wreck at this job, only to then immediately dive into this very difficult process. I want to have a brief period of time in which I can have a break, do things that make me happy, and make peace with this decision and what my future may hold.\n\nI want to quit this job and take the time leading up to the detoxing for myself, so I can go into this process feeling some closure on this chapter of my life, and getting some moments of peace before it begins.\n\nMy concern is my finances. I am poor and don't really make enough for my living expenses as it is. I have an 'ok' amount in savings but never touch it because I have been completely broke before and I'm scared of using it. So quitting my job leading up to the detox is one thing, but the problem is I'll also have to be out of work during the detox period, and once that settles figuring out what I can even handle doing coming out of this.\n\nThats a decent chunk of time without income.\n\nI'm trying to decide what to do. Do I deserve getting to have this time to myself to try and have some peace before the process? Is it okay to want to do this? Or is it totally unjustified and I'll have brought any future struggles financially on myself and shouldn't expect pity from anyone?\n\nWhat is the right thing to do here? Thats my problem\n\nOkay that was a lot more than I expected to write, sorry. If you've read the whole thing I'd be unbelievably grateful to get your input and advice. Thank you.",

I realise my \"problems\" are laughable in comparison to others, I guess that's why I never liked to talk about these feelings with others and I feel like I have nothing to complain about. \n\nBasically my WHOLE life story from this point:\n\n\nMy parents had the best intentions, I was well loved. My childhood was uneventful and boring. I grew up learning to be polite and to be respectful and to stay quiet. All good things I suppose \n\nAnyway I am trying not to go on about my childhood or give detailed backstory. The point is, to many people, I was loved and cherished. However when I look back now I was coddled. People my generation talk about playing outside until the street lights came on, nope not me. I wasn't allowed out by myself. Which by todays standards is normal but not back then. \n\nAt 12 I was pulled out of school to be homeschooled. I was so excited because who wouldn't be.  And I've always lied to myself about losing friends I would say oh my social skills were fine. My parents did too, they believed my social skills were fine. But the truth is as soon as I was homeschooled I lost all my friends. Aside from that the first  year homeschooling was fun, my parents did a good job and were really interested and invested.\n\nA year in homeschooling I was very lonely. I had no friends and made friends online. They talked about their friends, they were homeschooled too, yeah it wasn't like that for me. \n\nI was incredibly lonely. Often I would listen to the radio and pretended that I was at a sleep over **cringe** I would write endlessly in my journals, I would have fantasies about boys cos I was 12 going on 13 lol. I never spoke to kids my own age, so you don't know how nervous I was about talking to boys\n\nThankfully at 13 my parents decided to move to a new town with slightly more opportunities. It had a youth group and I made some friends. I got my first bf and also met my future husband. So yeah the social problems was kinda fixed but my parents both had to work at this stage to pay for the new house. I was left on my own to educate myself, they didn't enrol me into a high school I think because I was so socially awkward I protested the idea. I was SO nervous about the mere idea of being with my peers. Most of my days I was by myself entirely. My parents at work or sleeping before work.  Unable to see my friends cause they were at school and I had \"schoolwork\" to do which was just working through textbooks lol. After school they often had things to do. I would wait until my youth group got together before I saw them.\n\n I am frustrated thinking about all this now as my parents never pushed me to do anything, I was 13/14 with no point, no goals. Because I was homeschooled I never gained official high school qualifications. \n\nWhen I was 16 my parents thought hairdressing would be ideal for me. I have no clue why they thought that as I had next to no social skills, wasn't super into hair and makeup but I think the idea was that it required no qualifications and if I passed and got qualified then they can pretend homeschooling worked lol. \n\nNaturally a shy girl like me failed miserably at hairdressing. So that was all over by 17. I enrolled myself into a correspondence school and managed to get one high school qualification. I then begged my mother to let me get a job at her work (much to my parents dismay) I actually had a very naive dream of travelling Europe, I got brochures for contiki and other companies that offer tours etc. I also dreamed of going to university.  That never happened lol. \n\nSo yeah, I ended up falling in love at 20. Married by 22. Two kids later and now I'm fucking 30 and I don't feel like I've really accomplished anything on my own.\n\nDespite the fact I had a full time job, when I was pregnant and able to support myself my parents stepped in and somewhat took over my life once more by buying my house which I rented from them and then later down the line  I was obligated to purchase from them. They made me feel bad because in order for me the be able to purchase it they had to lower the price and I feel guilty about it still. All my savings were put into this house. \n \nI brought this house in my mid 20s, with a great deal of my parents help and of course my husbands income and my savings. Yeah a lot of people think this is something to be proud of and I should be grateful for a roof over my head, blah blah blah but it's not that it's the feeling that even though it's my name on the house, it's not really mine or my real accomplishment. I can't just sell it either, it needs a lot of work which cost money I don't have. \n\nMy parents come over often put their two cents in with what I should do with the house, critique my housekeeping skills, judge the lack of yard work done. My dad even informed me once that my mum said to him that the kids should be \"thriving\" In my house and suggested that they aren't. I have a whole camera roll on my phone showing that they do thrive here. They know  that but yet they say shit like this all the time. \n\nYeah it's a nice wee house that needs a lot of work. Yeah I can make money from it, but I always have that sinking feeling that my parents are to thank for it. and sure I could have refused it, but who would? You have a kid on the way and your parents are buying you a house, why would u turn that down? Even if it needs a lot of work done.\n I often feel like they had very little faith in me succeeding in anything. I had a full time job and my bf at the time (now husband) had a part time job. We would have been okay without my parents help. \n\nDon't get me wrong I am grateful for the opportunities I have had and yeah of course  its nothing to complain about and I'm not, what I am complaining about is the fact I've never had the opportunity to accomplish things on my own. \nI love my parents but I resent them for letting me just...be. Not \"pressuring\" me to do...anything important. letting me get to adulthood without any sort of qualifications and letting me self educate myself. I resent them for pulling me out of school. \n\nI'm 30 and still anxious about things. I still don't have my full driver license. I feel extremely anxious around driving.  I drive my kids and have my restricted license but it's so embarrassing when my 17 year old nephew has his full license and I don't. \n\nI also don't have friends. The ones I've made as a new mum drifted off and we don't talk or see each other much now. \n\nAnd yeah I am hyper aware I sound like a spoiled brat bitching about life when I've had it really good and I admit that I have but to me these feelings are a big deal. I don't feel like I am an actual adult even as a married woman with kids. \n\nYeah I've tried getting a part time job, I had one for a bit but it didn't really work out and everything, (studying and working) is super intimidating. \n\nAnd don't get me started on the fact my mum has suggested we sell both houses and buy one big property with two dwellings, that shit is nightmare fuel for me.  Living on the same property as my folks, omg.\n\nI don't know how to be a adult. This year I am however working on a glow up, I'm working on losing weight. I want to get my full license even though that's intimidating as hell. \n\nThank you to those of you who have bothered to read this novel I've written.",

I know people say it’s good for your healthy every now and then, but I just don’t like it and I feel like it ruins my perception on real happiness. I don’t feel happy in the long run after it. Another big is procrastination, and I think that one is more relatable.

        "text": "**THIS IS PART 2** of the tools I use daily to keep myself disciplined/make it easier.\n\nThis is my complete list of mental tools I apply daily to:\n\n**Perform tasks I genuinely do not want to do.**\n\n**Resist things I desperately want to do.**\n\nTable of contents:\n\nPart 1-\n\n* Meditation (Discipline mini-workout)\n* Motivational Awareness (Discipline Fuel)\n* Adaptive Denial (Discipline Placebo)\n\nPart 2-\n\n* Urge Surfing (Discipline Lane Assist)\n* Chunking (Discipline Rep Assist)\n* Shame-free Analysis (Discipline Muscle repair)\n\nI should note prior to attempting these, I highly recommend applying these for a MINIMUM of 30 days, like going to the gym, **if you quit when you don’t have a 6-pack in a week you have unrealistic expectations**.\n\nDo it for 30 days, I guarantee you’ll see results and thank me.\n\nUrge Surfing- \n\nUrge surfing is a technique therapists use to help recovering addicts, it was taken from the Dialectal behavioral therapy skills training manual for those interested.\n\nHow to urge surf-\n\n**When you feel the urge to perform an addictive behavior:**\n\n**Focus on labeling and observing the emotion.**\n\nWatch it increase, then decrease, then increase, and so on until it goes away.\n\n“I really want a cigarette, this urge is very intense….the urge is subsiding, now it’s increasing again…okay it’s fading away.”\n\nIt’s like practicing meditation, but instead of focusing on controlling your thoughts, it’s on controlling your urges.\n\nChunking- \n\nChunking helps make tasks less intimidating by **breaking tasks up into pieces you believe you have the willpower to manage**. This raises your confidence in your ability to complete a task and makes you much more likely to actually do it. \n\nQuitting smoking becomes, quitting for 5 minutes. Anyone can quit for 5 minutes. \n\nIf you quit for 5 minutes, once your confidence goes up you can quit for a day, then a week. \n\nOver time you’ve just quit forever. \n\nTo apply this to other common goals:\n\nTo build a toned body becomes: Do 5 reps for one muscle. \n\nTo build wealth becomes: Just invest $5. \n\nTo find friends becomes: Just talk to one person. \n\nTo build a content business becomes: Just write for 5 minutes. (Me right now) \n\nShame-free Analysis-\n\nWhen endeavoring to complete any worthwhile goal I can say unequivocally, you will fail. \n\nThat’s okay though, that’s part of the plan. **But like a plane crashing, when you fail you need to take the time to discern what happened.** The important thing though is SHAME-FREE. \n\nI emphasize shame-free because, shame stresses us out. When we stress out what do we do? Turn to that thing we’re trying to avoid. So if you stop stressing yourself out, you’re less likely to repeat the mistake. \n\nToday I: LIST MISTAKE.\n\nTomorrow I will: WRITE NEXT TIME I WILL BLANK.\n\n**No emotion, no punishment, just facts.** \n\nA habit I’m building right now is replacing fast food with healthier foods. \n\nThe other day after working out I copped some chipotle. \n\nAfter failing at my habit I sat down that evening and did my analysis. \n\nToday I: Ate Chipotle because I forgot my tools to resist it. \n\nTomorrow I: Will leave a reminder by the coffee table for review while I drink my coffee. \n\nI never said, “gah you failed again, you always do this!” I just shrugged it off and said, “next time we’ll do this.”\n\nIt’s easier to apply the tools if you can remember you have them in the first place. \n\nThere you have it you guys, In summary to discipline yourself easier remember these highlights:\n\n* Meditate in the morning for ideally 10-30minutes to strengthen foundational discipline. \n* Write down somewhere obvious WHAT happens long term when you do the task you’re reluctant to perform. \n* Practice Mantras to trick your brain into believing what you want to be true. (No I hate smoking) \n* When you feel the urges come, remember you’re here to ride the wave, not dive in it.\n* Raise your confidence in your ability and eagerness to complete a task by making it smaller. \n* When you do fail figure out why, don’t punish yourself, just fix it. \n\nLet me know if you're struggling with anything specific and I'll see if I can help you.",

        "text": "Random rant \n\nHey! I'm a uni student rn \nI like this girl and I feel like I'm not good enough for her at all (looks wise ,personality,humour everything sucks). To sort of beat these kind of thoughts ive been doing some reflecting , but I feel like this made me feel even more worse abt myself \n\nI've realised these following things abt me and want to change these things abt me.\n\n1. I lie to make myself look better aswell as to not be held accountable. 2 of the things I hate the most abt myself. I exaggerate things I've done in the past to seem \"cooler\" . I lie abt mistakes I've done and try to cover them up until I have no choice but to admit my mistake. I dont want to seem like a failure \n\n2.I get angry and frustrated when someone points out a mistake I've done. I get this internal rage like ,even though I know I'm wrong and once again try to lie or bs my way out of it. I lie abt knowing certain things. I'm not really good with general knowledge or things some ppl call \"common sense\". I hate it when I dont know something and ppl go like ,\" WAIT U REALLY DONT KNOW THT, HOW DO U NOT KNOW THT\". I dont want to seem dumb and hence I lie . \n\n3. I seek attention and pity. This once again tying back to the lying to look cool or better.\nI thought after coming to uni , I would stop the lying , get a fresh start since nobody knows anything abt me , but tht seems to have only fueled the lying. I've once again lied abt stuff I did in highschool since nobody can truly know if its true or not. The thing is I've really tried those things but ended up failing and tht makes me feel like shit. I act as if I've succeeded even though I failed. \n\n4. I dont know why but I constantly think abt bad things happening to me and imagine getting pity from others. \n\n5. I've started going to gym ever since uni started in hopes of improving myself and gaining more self confidence.  But then jealousy hit me. I know it's different genes and its different from person to person. Its almost been 7 months since I've started going to the gym and when I compare myself to wht I was before, ive made massive improvements , but for some reason I cant stop comparing myself to this one friend who comes to the gym once in a blue moon or something but still manages to lift more than me or do better than me.( We both started gym around the same time, but I was definitely way weaker than him when we first started out). \n\n6. Another thing is tht I am incredibly grateful to have a friend who pushes me to do my best and more than wht I can do in the gym. Sometimes I actually end up doing more than wht I thought I could do and tht makes me so happy and proud of myself, but often I tend to fail and then start feeling like I couldn't live up to his expectations even though it isnt true. \n\nReading through this post again, I cant help but think tht im not making this post to truly better myself but that this is just another attempt by me to seek attention from you guys. I just keep spiralling in this same loop again and again and again and I have no clue as to wht to do. \n\nI dont know if this is relevant to the post but I've definitely lived a luxurious life , my parents have given me everything I wanted. This makes me feel like a spoiled brat rn but idk I'm just feeling lost rn. \n\nThe main thing I hope to gain out of this post is ways to stop the lying and my pity seeking behaviour. I feel like if I can fix tht part of myself , I would be a much better person and at the least wouldnt dissapoint myself.Its gotten to the extent tht I lie even when I didnt meant to.After I lie i go like ( wait why did I even lie abt tht, I had 0 reason to lie abt tht ).\n\nI appreciate you guys for listening to my long rant.Any advice or criticism is appreciated. I feel like I need some ppl to knock some sense into me",

        "text": "So I went through a breakup that shook my worldview completely because not only did I lose my S/O, the lack of support/toxic advice from my self-proclaimed soul sisters whom I had completely trusted, really spiralled me into a dark place in my life. I had to cut them out cause they were harming me and now I'm truly all alone.\n\nI'd say I've always been a pretty motivated person who liked to learn and have plenty of hobbies. I have a good job (6 figures), bought my own place, etc. but I was so depressed I just wanted to destroy everything in my life. This is because I always thought, oh I want to do more, learn more, so I could be of better service to others, so I could connect better with others. There are challenges in life but by supporting each other , life becomes beautiful.  I felt like I had that relationship with my best friends. But since losing my entire support system through this one breakup, I realized how fleeting relationships are and no one really wants to change despite what they say. I also feel horribly alone because I realized I was the only one who thought that love was about taking care of each other and supporting one another through thick and thin. \n\nI realize my existing life motto was no longer serving me so I thought to just focus on myself; but I find that I don't really know WHAT to do anymore. I have no desire to learn or to improve because I no longer have a WHY.\n\nAnd I realize it's making me very vulnerable. One day I look at some TikTok and suddenly i think i should blow my money on travel, another day, I should start my own business and quit my job, I feel like I have no grasp of myself anymore. I suddenly understand why some people get involved with cults after a deep loss cause it's just too much to bear.\n\nTherefore, I wanted to ask how those of you who have gone through a shift like this managed to get in touch with yourselves again?",

Most of the time, I start by writing about the event/feelings/story, then I carefully detail my feelings and emotions, finally I ruminate on what I can do to avoid/improve/cope with it. This strategy is adopted from the Rising strong book by Brene Brown: you start with your shitty first draft of the event, then you rumble through this story, and most times you'll find a lesson through the nasty ordeal that gives it a meaning and place in your life.

        "text": "\nI know it sounds like a terrible idea. Maybe it is I dunno. \n\nJust hear me out. \n\nI’m doing absolutely horrible. Lots of things have been going  bad in for a long time. I’m now 17. \n\nDon’t misunderstand me I absolutely love school. But everything in my life is stoping me from enjoying it. Now it just constantly makes me stressed. Homework, people, teachers. Im sick at least 1 time a week. I can’t deal with it. My private life is a absolute nuclear explosion. I have absolutely 0% support and I’m just tired. \n\nThe only way I’ve made it this far is by being afraid of being left behind missing opportunity’s. And I probably will. \n\nBut I’m just so tired, I can’t do this anymore. I’d rather do a year over than live like this. I have a lot going on in my life, and I think  not having to worry about school for a while will do wonders. It will get me on my feet again. My life has been constant set backs for me. \n\nI also wouldn’t mind like a special program? Like that my teacher consider my situation and I get more leeway. But idk if my school is flexible like that \n\n\nI just really don’t know…\n\nI’ve finally gotten in contact with a therapist but I’ve only had 1 appointment yet and it was more of a introduction and we’ve not really touched the school stuff yet(as I said I have a LOT going on). So idk \n\nFor reference: I just spent the entire day in my bed crying because my mom stressing me the fuck out. Instead of making the homework assignments that is due tomorrow haha \n\n\nTLDR,\n\nI want to take a break from school for my mental health.\n\nEDIT: potential ADHD is not helping ether :(",

        "text": " \n\nI've always been quiet, alone and never really know what to say. I also get social anxiety. The last time I had friends was in early elementary school, switched schools and haven't had friends since. I feel like I missed out on a lot by not having any friends in middle/high school. I seriously don't know what friends do, talk about, how to interact, what people do when they hang out, what to say etc. Especially because the last time I had friends was in elementary school and the topics and activities will be different now.\n\nFor the past year I've mostly been at home not doing much, I play sports once a week and have minimal social interaction there. People can pick up on me being socially awkward, anywhere I go people notice. I used to think it was just in school and if I went to a different place like a sports club (multiple) then it would be different. But I'm still the same, I'm awkward so people are awkward around me. I also often get the fated question \"Why are you so quiet?\" The real answer for me is that I genuinely don't know what to say.\n\nIt was only recently that I realized I don't actually ask people questions or initiate conversations. And if somebody initiates a conversation with me my answers will usually be short and I never asked any questions back. Lately I've been trying to at least ask \"And you\" or if they asked me something about my weekend I'd ask them \"What did you do this weekend?\" It seems small but I really didn't do that before. I still don't know/can't initiate conversations because of 2 reasons: 1) anxiety, 2) lack of social skills.\n\nPlease give me some tips/advice because I don't want to be like this forever, especially now that uni is coming up and if I don't change it's just going to be the same all over again. Are there any books I can read, videos I can watch, things I can practice or say, mindsets I can have?",

My job is relatively chill so when there's down time, my go-to is course browsing Reddit, Youtube, Instagram, etc, and if not then I'm pretty much always listening to ambient music or some podcast. This has been fun for a while but after a year and half of this, I'm finding that my brain is seriously overthinking the hell out of things and I get bored super easily. I'm assuming that I need some sort of dopamine detox. \n\nSo obviously just NOT using my phone and working in silence more often is probably a good strategy for this, but I'm wondering what else I could be doing. Is sitting in silence seriously the best answer? Or are there more productive things I could be doing or listening to while working from home?",

        "text": "So I’m 18 and have always been the quiet kid whether it’s been at school or in my family. I have no social life, all I do is sit around at home most of the day and dont do much except play video games, watch something on Netflix or on my phone watching YouTube or TikTok. \n\nI go to community college and don’t talk to anyone, i might talk to one person but apart from that im mostly silent for the whole day. I don’t know how long it’s been like this but I think I might have social anxiety because whenever I’m walking anywhere where there’s a lot of people, I feel like I don’t know where to look. I always think in my head, “Should i look at these people coming this way? Should I look forward and past them? Should I look at the ground to see where I’m walking? Where do I look?”. It annoys me a lot because I don’t always feel nervous in public but I just feel awkward sometimes because I feel like I can’t do a simple thing as that. \n\nI don’t think it bothered me at much first but now the whole thing sometimes makes me feel really alone even when im with someone. Ever since growing up I can’t say I’ve ever had one solid friend group. I do have a WhatsApp group chat with two friends but one, i haven’t spoke to for months, and the other is at my college but he’s not always in and not in my class so i don’t always see him.  \n\nI think most of my life I’ve had a habit of only talking to someone if they talk to me first. I have spoken first before, but mostly wait for the other person to start a conversation. I don’t talk to anyone in my class and always have one AirPod in at breaks and lunch. And for so long now it’s like I’m having a conversation with myself out loud. I don’t reply to myself as if it’s another person but I do it all the time when I’m alone. I’m starting to think this is really unhealthy because first of all, as I said, i don’t really understand it myself, but it feels like I could be trying to trick myself into thinking I’m talking to someone, maybe as some kind of coping mechanism to not FEEL alone. And I know that probably sounds VERY unhealthy. \n\nI don’t know if I even worded or explained any of this well but I just wanted talk about everything all at once. Is anyone else like this? Is this bad?",

        "text": "I took a leap of faith and now I feel I'm naked and riding a tiger into the storm in pursuit of a professional goal. \n\nTo give some context, back in 2018 I was a medical student in Nicaragua (5th year of medicine) until I was denied that right. Due to political issues, I was forced out of my career despite being one of the best students in my year. 9 months later, after fighting severe depression and feeling my heart racing  24/7 I decided that I couldn't let that stop me. I became a copywriting freelancer.\n\nSince then, I have achieved a lot in terms of knowledge and experience. I've managed digital projects, helped agencies put systems in place, and am extremely proficient both as a writer and as an SEO specialist. But at what cost?\n\nBeing Nicaraguan and not having a degree means that a lot of agencies try to take advantage of me. Although higher than the national average, almost on par with what call centers pay to anyone who can speak decent English, most agencies offered me around $450-700/month in a \"Take it or leave it\" kind of deal. Knowing that I have helped some of these agencies implement systems to improve their customer retention rate, and my productivity was on par with their highest-earning guys, that felt like a slap in the face. But of course, I was just seen as the Nicaraguan guy. Very smart and helpful, but just that.\n\n**Eventually, this led me to think of my degree again.**\n\nNot too long ago, I told one of the guys at the agency I was working for that I wanted to pursue a degree and applied to a university in Canada. Two weeks later, on Feb 27, without any notice the agency closed my email account, the owner became unresponsive, and I have not been paid for my services during the last month.\n\nAt around the same time, an opportunity arose to study and get a degree from University Canada West. So, I'm doing what anyone who respects him/herself would do. \n\nOpen my own company to pay for my studies.\n\nNow all I need to do is somehow raise $3,500 CAD in the next two weeks (Until 03/20/2023) and would be starting in July or September.\n\n**So, here I am, riding the tiger into the dark. I'm risking everything on this one move and it scares the shit out of me.**\n\nI thought to myself \"Ok. If I was able to help these guys develop SOPs and improve their client retention rate. I could, instead, be doing this for myself.\"\n\nI took whatever little I had left but a month's worth of rent, to buy all the tools I needed and register my company in Florida. The entire process, including the Tax ID number, takes roughly 2 weeks, the same amount of time I have left to pay for my first university fees.\n\nAs of today, I literally put everything I had into a dream.  \nDid I make the right choice? I don't know it just yet.\n\nWill it work out? I certainly hope so. I pretty much like sleeping with a roof over my head.\n\nAm I scared? You have no idea how scared I feel right now.\n\nBut...\n\nI hope for the best and will do my best.\n\nIf there's anyone out there that ever feels like life makes no sense and there's no way out of a bad situation, I hope you find the strength to move forward. Sometimes, it feels lonelier than what most people can handle, but if you make it through that, you'll start appreciating the green of your own grass. \n\nA little fate can sometimes go a long way.\n\nAnd if any of you guys know anyone out there that might find my skills useful, please help me get my name out there. Right now I'm going all in and I am willing to work my socks off, probably harder than any human you've ever met before. \n\n**All of this for a chance to get my name out there and pay for a right that my home country has denied me.**",

That sounds creepy but I guess what I'm trying to say is that I do think I am kind (genuinely), I care about other people, and I listen, make jokes, do everything your supposed to do in a social situation, but it still doesn't work. I'm not super introverted either. I like talking to people.\n\nI'm in a huge theatre/musical ensemble thing and for example, if people are in a group and one person goes off to the other side of the room, the rest of the group will follow. I've been trying to stick my ground and stay on the side and interact with the other people who are still on that side but it still feels like no one wants to hang out with me: out of their own will anyway. If I ask something, the other person will answer but will not reciprocate so the conversation just goes stale.  \n\nI know that a lot of times you have to be the one to make the effort, the initiative and I don't want to compare myself to others but there are other people in this group who make half the effort but seem to have so many friends. These are the people that won't even acknowledge me when they see me outside even though I'm a part of the ensemble but will go on to have so many friends within the group. How is that possible? It frustrates me because I do make the effort to know everyone's names, to know something about them that I can follow up on later, and it's not because I'm faking it either: I genuinely care. But the people who don't make this effort suddenly have so many friends. The newer members automatically become better friends with them than they do with me, even though they are new and I have been a member for almost 3.5 years. The few friends I do have though are really nice but they are also friends with these other people and it just seems forced whenever I try talking to all of them when they are together. \n\nI've had people ask me what my name was multiple times even though I've talked to them before and remembered their names because we are after all an ensemble that practices together 3-4 times a week. I never took it personally but it is starting to bother me a bit. Maybe there's something I'm doing wrong? I have been told I'm too nice, so maybe people feel like they can't be brash or \"friendly\" rude with me, even though I jest about myself and make self deprecating jokes (not too many but enough to come across as relatable). Maybe there are some invisible walls around me that I don't know about. Sorry if I couldn't articulate this feeling well enough.",

I think I’m at the point where I’d like to pursue a potential relationship with this girl, but there’s a bit of a hurdle I’m struggling to get over. I finally got it in my head that there’s probably no chance anything would ever be rekindled between my ex and myself, though I always have felt that if she would want to start something again I’d jump at the opportunity. But then this weekend comes and we’ve spent a good amount of time together (we share a lot of the same friends since we’re both on the track team at our college) and it’s been pretty nice. She and I were getting along very well. But now I don’t know what to do. It feels wrong to pursue another relationship if I still have feelings for my ex, because it would be unfair to this other girl. But there’s probably nothing between my ex and I other than we may just be getting along as friends again. Is it wrong to start trying to get to know this other girl while sorting through this?

If you are lonely, I encourage you to reach inside you and ask if you have done anything that makes the most important person in your life, that is you, happy today? I believe the cure for loneliness is acceptance and self-love. You need to accept that this is part of your life now, and start taking actions to treat yourself better. Then I want to you to reach outside and ask what is a self-less thing you’ve done for someone. To keep treating yourself as the best friend you’ll ever have, and keep working on yourself and being kind to others, you’ll find a purpose and meaning that will carry you through the loneliest moments.\n\nI wish you all the best.

This, I can never be proud or respect myself unless I’m the best. \n\nI’m terrified of overestimating myself. I question everything I do so much, and it’s the reason for my social anxiety, and my inhibition. For example, sometimes I feel really attractive, but should I be feeling this way if most people don’t find me attractive? There’s a difference between confidence built upon an accurate self image and pure delusion.\n\nI can’t stand people that think they’re better or superior to others in a certain skill, or in knowledge but are to clueless to see that they aren’t. I feel like if I start to like myself, and view my accomplishments more favorably, I’ll be that guy who doesn’t realize he’s useless\n\nI work so hard on myself because I never feel good enough, and I wish I could be proud, but someone would always be there to tear it down. If there’s a way to be proud, and still be motivated to set new goals, let me know. If it’s possible that I’m just not good enough and just need to keep working harder, let me know.\n\nHow do you know when you’re good enough to be proud? As I’ve repeated, I’m afraid of being around people who will think my skill sets, and knowledge that I value are worthless.\n\nDon’t say other people don’t matter, they do. Being lonely sucks.",

        "text": "My whole life I’ve always been overlooked, had my skills and accomplishments diminished, and it’s destroyed my confidence. I don’t think this is a confidence issue because I was confident before, but no one cared, and people would always find a way to not care. I’ve always felt like people always look for an excuse to give up on me or get rid of me. I used to like being underestimated, but when no one EVER thinks you have any value, it gets demoralizing when it happens over, and over, and over. \n\nI don’t know why people see me this way. Maybe it’s because I’m not masculine, but most people really don’t have to do as much to be valued. I’ve always had to work 10 times harder and be the best in the room at whatever just to be acknowledged or valued, and as I said before, the slightest slip up would ruin all of that.\n\nAny advice helps.",

        "text": "I’ve had my fair share of toxic relationships in my life, i was left by baby daddy when I was 18, because he wanted to go to medical school and couldn’t handle being a dad. Since then, even though I also planned (and did) go to med school and did basically what he did but with a child, I’ve developed this cynical and selfish outlook towards relationships. Being left alone with a child at 17 one day to the other truly traumatized me and I don’t realized how much until recently. It’s very very easy for me to drop someone if I feel I am not getting what i want or for any petty fight as means of self preservation. To me, it’s just my child, my family and I. \n\nUntil two years ago  I started a romantic relationship with someone I knew as a friend. He recently move to Chile temporarily until next year so we decided to continue long distance, he is the child of immigrants himself like me, from the same country as my father so even though we were raised in different countries our childhoods culturally were pretty similar. This brings me to my point, he is an only child child of a now widow, he’s lived abroad for many years and this is the first time he is finally living in country close to his mother. He took her to live with him while he stays in Chile which is fine with me, I am extremely close to both my parents as well and I couldn’t imagine even being with any partner that had an issue with that. \n\nNow, I came to Chile to spend 40 days with him because he won’t have a vacation until November. So he can’t go to my country until then. I stayed with him the first week but with his mum being there I didn’t really felt that comfortable, I’ve met her only a handful of times so I thought maybe it was better I stayed in a hotel. So I am leaving Wednesday, and after this I won’t seeing him either until November which is 8 months away or maybe I can come again in September but it’s not certain. We planned to spend the next 3 days in another city but today his mum, who is 80 years old and suffers from depression, got the news her sister who lives in Tajikistan had a stroke. She is in inconsolable and he is afraid for her safety so he is staying with her which I totally understand, I would do the same and be angry if I knew my partner had the reaction I am having right now. I am crying my eyes out, I feel abandoned and alone. I even to be honest feel that he is lying even though I know objectively he is not (I have his family in social media). I also feel like a horrible person, but I also feel awful that I may barely see him now that I’m here and then be completely long distance for months. I’ve started therapy not that long ago but it’s a slow process. I don’t want to ruin this relationship due to my issues.",
