I'm struggling to generate a well crafted mela plan with proper nutrition timing and macros that actually suit my goals. I have all my stats already, but I would really love a service that just comes up with diverse meal planning and then I just buy the ingredients and make them ya know? Anyway thanks for reading if you made it this far, really apriciative the knowledge that comes out of this thread. \n\n- cheers from a fellow mamal(who is definitely not a lizard person🦎)",

Usually I'd have tuna on pita bread, and salad for lunch. Easy to add fats to salad via oils/feta cheese etc, but she has recommended I limit my tuna intake due to the high amount of mercury. What are some easy go to (work day!) lunch ideas, that I could pop on a piece of bread, or have carbs and protein in one? I don't loveeee chicken so would love to avoid, but will eat it if easy enough and beneficial \n\nI have lived off protein yoghurts etc for ages, what are some alternatives to this as well, for snacks? I'd love to get rid of added sugar/processed foods as much as possible :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers for your help!\n\nLucy",

I am wondering if anyone knows a good place whether it is a website, forum or possibly this subreddit where I could share a list of some of the foods I will be avoiding to see if there are any recommendations for substitutions, both for nutritional uses and substitutions for cooking. Any advice would be appreciated and if this a question better suited for a different community please let me know, thank you!",
