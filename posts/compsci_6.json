        "text": "Hello! I’m a third year swe student in Canada and to put it simply, I’ve been depressed for a long time, but it significantly worsened since starting university. While I know this is no excuse, it has seriously impeded my ability to develop my skills and abilities outside of school (side projects, practicing leetcode/interview-style questions, etc.). My resume is also garbage (pretty much empty besides some school projects, and the odd job or two) and now that I’ve started to get my life back on track, I’ve realized I’m very behind in a very competitive industry. \nI simply just do not know where to start but what I do know is that I would like to get my foot in the door with a coop before graduating (if even possible). I don’t know if I should work a random service or food job for the summer to get my finances back in check or if I should take the summer as a true break working on my mental health, some projects, participate in hackathons, and practice my coding skills.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.",

Indeed, there may be an infinity of universes, all with their own laws of physics, their own collections of stars and galaxies (if stars and galaxies can exist in those universes), and maybe even their own intelligent civilizations.\n\nIt could be that our universe is just one member of a much grander, much larger multitude of universes: a multiverse.

The customer puts something in, the AI generates what they want in a few minutes, if it doesn't work the customer says \"it doesn't work, do it again in a different way\", repeat cycle until the customer gets something they're satisfied with.

        "text": "A lil background- I took comp sci throughout high school and started my first year of college going into electrical engineering. I dropped out (not because i couldn’t keep up, i liked the classes) but because my first year was during peak covid and my entire college experience was really bad overall (got covid and was delirious, no roommates, some math teachers who didnt know how to use the online platform😑). I took a year and a half break, now trying to go back and my mom doesn’t want me to drop out again, and isnt willing to pay nearly as much (understandable). Does anybody have any recommendations for an online degree in computer science (BS/associates) that are affordable(under 500$ per credit hour)? Or any programs that fast track and will prepare for a job in comp sci? I have heard of degrees online from colleges that are specific to computer science, and bootcamps that fast track to a job in computer science/tech, and am more interested in those than a more traditional college experience. Also wondering if anyone has done a bootcamp/online fast track and if it was worth it. Any insight/recommendations would be greatly appreciated🙌! \n\nAlso read rules not sure if this belongs in this sub🤷‍♀️lmk if theres another sub i should move this post to",

Two days later I then had a meeting with HR where we discussed about salary and start dates. They told me they probably wouldn't be able to extend an official offer within the next 10 days due to the holidays and offices being closed which was totally understandable.\n\nFast forward to last week I asked for an update and was notified by the hiring manager on Thursday that an offer is in the approval stages and that HR will notify us both when there is an update. He stated he had been trying to hunt them down for a few days and that it has been hard to get ahold of them... (which is weird). It is now the following Monday and I still have not received anything...\n\nIs this delay in the process normal? I am worried they will not extend an offer at all. Thanks for the advice",

I think that those of you who grew up on magazines/manuals and saw the evolution of the internet and the advent of platform such as stackoverflow and GitHub can second me on this point. Starting today is not the same as starting 10/20/40 years ago, and depending on the background or the environment you grow up in, the experience of becoming a programming can vary by a lot. \n\nWhat are your thoughts about the trend that brought us from manuals to blogs and websites, and now to systems such as chatgpt/copilot and possibly to even better programming assistants in the future? Will programming become pair-programming with intelligent systems?\n\nDo you think that learning by interacting with a virtual assistant is just the same process as reading and copying code from magazines/manuals/books and then trying to tweak it (with a great time saving bonus) or that this is a completely new framework that's going to bring to something fundamentally different for future generations of coders?\n\nDo you think that a wise use of these tools can help us become better programmers or that they’re a threat to our learning processes?",
