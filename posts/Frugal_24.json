I'm pretty sure both are made from pure coffee beans, it's just that instant coffee is ground so fine that it instantly blends into the water.\n\nPeople eat coffee beans, so the entire bean is edible - so why not drinkable? Doesn't it make sense to fine grind coffee beans to the point where 100% of it dissolves in water, allowing us to use less when making coffee, throw out nothing, and save money at the end of the day? Do the grounds serve any purpose?\n\nI'm aware there are probably flavor implications I'm totally missing, but for me the difference between instant and ground coffee is minimal at best.",

        "text": "I lived in my own house for 30 years. I could do a lot to control costs.   \nI have lived in a condo for the past 8 years.  I am very involved in the management of the association.  I can do only a little to control costs.   \nCondos are not frugal.    \nConvince me otherwise!\n\nHere is why...\n\n1. common resources are often wasted or abused.   \nWater: Have a trickling sink?  Oh well, maybe one day that will be fixed.  \nWater: Have a running toilet?  See above.    \nHeat/AC: Did you close that door behind you when you left a common area?  Maybe, maybe not.  Oh well.    \nSome people will not be careful of common areas: doors, door frames, walls, floors, etc.  Things will be abused and need repairs much more regularly.   \nIf a majority of owners want to spend money on something frivolous, you will have to too.  \n2. No matter how conscientious the owners are, the state will cost you much more money...  \nYou will spend a lot of money in condo fees on fire systems: sprinkler system, alarms system, a monitoring system, a company to monitor 24/7 these systems. All of these systems need inspections, annual maintenance and periodic repairs.   \nYou will spend money on water backflow testing, which is not required for a house.   \nDepending on your condo, you will spend money on an elevator: inspection, maintenance contract, repairs, etc.    \nIf the town picks up trash, it will be part of your property taxes, but they may not pickup yours.   \nYou are likely to have to pay for storm water management inspections and reports.   \nThe list goes on.    \nI am not judging the necessity of any of this, but know you will pay for it, and you can do very little to control those costs. \n3. For the most part, contractors for the association will charge more, do less, and with less contentiousness than if you call for your house.  I could go on and on with example after example of contractors ending up costing more money than in a house for the same thing and then on top of that creating other problems due to lack of contentiousness while working: oops I banged that wall, oops that weather stripping came off, oops my truck bent your light pole, etc. \n\nThe takeaway is that if you are frugal, and like controlling your costs, think long and hard before buying a condo. Does not mean condos aren't right for some people, even some frugal people, but they are expensive. I am an example of that person. I wanted to live in a place in which the only way I could afford it was a condo.  A house is out of the price range, but after another 8 years of condo expenses I might think otherwise about the condo being my only feasible option. Maybe a house would be working longer for, or maybe I really had no options and needed to pick a different place to live.  \n\nHave you owned a house and a condo, and were active in the management of the condo?    \nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "I know that sometimes being frugal doesn't mean buying the literal cheapest crap out there. As I've gotten older I've started to really understand the meaning of \"quality over quantity\" which is why I usually stick to Samsung phones. I love their protection program when you buy direct from Samsung and the ability to trade in once that 2 year protection is over. I'm alss just used to their UI, I've been using Samsung phones since my very first one way back in 2012.\n\nI currently have a Galaxy S20 5G but it's about 3 years old as I traded in another phone for it right around it's release date in 2020. It works just fine, but while working in a nursing home it fell out of my locker onto a hard tile floor and managed to crack despite being in a shockproof case and having a screen protector. The cracks are toward the bottom left corner, but tiny shards of glass have started to fall out and parts of my screen are unresponsive. I'm heartbroken as up until then I'd never cracked a phone before. \n\nI did some shopping around and found out that Samsung's newest A53 has a flat (no curved edges) screen and the battery in it is about 500 mAh stronger than the S20 I'm still using. The only downside really is that I would be dropping down from 12 gb of RAM to just 4. I'm really looking at this A53 as I can get it for less than $300. \n\nIs this a good choice, or are there better more frugal options out there that I should try? I know tax refunds are coming, but even with that I just can't justify spending close to $1,000 on the newer S models and I still don't quite trust the funky \"flip\" models. I'd be willing to try other brands as well as long as they're durable and have decent battery and RAM as I use my phone for day to day life and for work sometimes.",

We are now at the end of our deal and the box is now $94 for 4 meals. However, this is STILL saving me money on groceries, and we are eating good solid meals every weeknight and ordering out much less. \n\nI know this still may not be in some people’s budgets, but I thought I would just mention it. The food is fresh and tastes good, and the portion sizes are generous, unlike Hello Fresh, which we’ve tried in the past and did not like.\n\nFor comparison, for 4 people, I was previously spending about $200 a week, and now between the Dinnerly and just buying breakfast and lunch stuff, spending less than $150. \n\nSo saving about $200 a month with the Dinnerly, and also eating better. And saving money on takeout, too. \n\nAgain, I know this may still be outside of some folks’ budgets, and I am probably less frugal than many people on this board, but this is something that’s really helping me, and I thought I would share.",

        "text": "Hey all - I know bit of a weird subreddit to go to ask questions.\n\nI don't want to get into my finances too much, but pretty much I'm in my mid 20s in a LCOL area and making $200k+, and my financial accounts are happy. I want to feel happier about spending my $ today, but every time I go to spend $, I feel like I don't *need* something, so I just don't, and then I have all this money left over at the end of the month, and it doesn't bring me alot of happiness. \n\nI don't think I am cheap - I eat good and my hobbies cost next to nothing, but I feel like because of my income, I should be spending more.\n\nI hope that didn't come off as a brag or something - does anyone live in a similar situation with a similar mindset? What did you do?",

We are 2 weeks in and it's a struggle! We had a conversation about it last night and feel exhausted by the amount of time we've spent planning, shopping and cooking over the last two weeks. We've also spend $500CDN ($300 the first week and $200 the second). And feel like we aren't really saving money. To be fair these are Costco runs and we stocked up on quite a few things and have portions of frozen meat in the freezer. We don't cook elaborate meals, but the prep + cook + clean takes time! \n\nAny advice from couples who have made the switch from a \"fend for yourself' to a \"plan together\" type meal situation. \n\nExamples of meal plans and bulk type recipes encouraged!

That ultimately, your body simply doesn't absorb the stuff and doesn't use it in the way it will use it from actual food. You have to eat the real food that contains these vitamins and nutrients, otherwise you're just kidding yourself.\n\nNow, here's the thing. This huge news story hit like 10 years ago now. Maybe even 15 years ago. (can't really remember). But, just because it's an older story doesn't mean it isn't true. Also, you've got a ton of multi-billion-dollar industries that would never want this information to be true, even if it was true.\n\nSo, because of my Frugal nature in general, should I bother with buying some sort of multi-vitamin, knowing that this \"inconvenient truth\" is still out there?",

We make homemade teas and blends of different drinks for variety. I love iced peppermint/chamomile tea, lemonade with cayenne pepper, boiled ginger and honey. If you freeze cucumbers you can add them to your thermos for a refreshing flavor, but pouring hot water on them first brings out a lot of flavor too. I freeze lemon and lime juice in tiny ice trays so its easier to add to your themos when getting ready in the morning. Sometimes ill freeze a cucumber mint lime ice cube, or a strawberry lemonade (pureed straw, simple syrup, lemon juice) which brings a nice change to a water thermos.
