        "text": "Hi TFCC! On mobile, sorry for formatting.\n\nI work for a company that handles legal help. My specific CC handles the part of the process where we tell the customer if our company can help with their problem. Whenever we go outbound, we leave a message telling them to call back, leave our name, company's name and phone number, and then we log the call.\nWhen people call back, they usually just say \"I received a call a few minutes ago.\" Which is fine.\nNormally they're ok speaking to any of us. Sometimes people ONLY want to speak to the agent that called them.\n\nToday, I receive this call.\nMe: -standard greeting-\nLady: I would like to speak to the person who called me today, she sounded super sweet in the voicemail.\nMe: That would be okay, did you get the name of the person who called you?\nL: No, can't you just tell me?\n(I had already peeped into her file since our system pulls up the file based on their number, and all there was was an old file that had nothing to do with her call today.)\nMe: Sure! If you're on file, I should he able to figure out who called you. May I have your name?\nL: My name is Idiot Customer.\nMe: Thank you! What would be the phone number we have on file?\nL: 123456\nMe: Okay, let me see. (We normally have more security steps but this was a new file.) Ma'am, it doesn't look like we have a file with the recent call. I have no way of knowing who called you.\nL: But I want to speak to that lady! She sounded really sweet!\nMe: I understand and I apologize, but I have no way of knowing who called you unless you give me a name.\nL: Don't you guys keep track of calls?\nMe: We do, however, sometimes we will get messages directly to our email and not through this system, so the call isn't logged. I'd be happy to assist you with your issue now if you'd like to speak to me.\nL: NO! I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE LADY WHO CALLED ME.\nMe: I'm sorry ma'am. Again, I have no way of knowing who called you. Are you sure you don't remember the name on the voicemail?\nL: NO!\nMe: Well, if you really want to speak to her, you can listen to the message again and let me know who it is.\nL: BUT I ALREADY HAVE YOU ON THE PHONE WHY WOULD I DO THAT?\nMe: So that I can know who called you. If you don't want to speak to me I'm going to need a name. Can you check your voice-\nL: IM GONNA CHECK THE VOICEMAIL AND CALL BACK. OH MY GOD!!!!!!\n-click-\n\nTL;DR: lady calls and demands a specific agent, doesn't know who called her regardless of the fact we state our name in voice messages, thinks I'm an idiot because I can't know who called her",

        "text": "LTL FTP, sorry about formatting in advance.\n\nI work for a major telecom here in the US. The dept I'm in is a specialty department that's assisted to help out with a particular text message in regards to mobile data speeds. Abbreviations will be short, but self explanatory.\n\n&gt;M: Thanks for calling. My name is digital. Are you calling in reference to mobile number XXX-XXX-XXXX?\n\n&gt;C: Yes I am\n\n&gt;M: Thanks. And your name if you don't mind?\n\n&gt;C: *gives name*\n\n&gt;M: Thanks, how can I help today?\n\n&gt;C: You guys better f-ing stop sending me this damned text message.\n\n&gt;M internally: Great, one of these people.\n\n&gt;M externally: Ok, I'm sorry to hear that you're upset by one of our text messages we sent you. So that I can get into your account to see what's going on, can you provide the account holder's name and the passcode to the wireless account?\n\n&gt;C: *provides account holder name* and I don't know the mother f-ing passcode. You're going to stop sending me this f-ing text message.\n\n&gt;M: Ok, in order to validate to see which text we sent you I need to be able to get into the account. If you're unable to provide that to me, then I can address the contents of the text message but you shall have to read the text to me as I cannot access the account.\n\nOk, so to elaborate a little bit, any of the major telecom companies in the US establish what's known as a data speed threshold for their unlimited customers that, at which point, based on several network criteria (ours is congestion), you could be throttled. This is what he's talking about and is about 25% of our calls. Customers often call to us thinking we're just regular customer care and we have to transfer them to another dept to assist with their request. Anyways, back to the tale of how we're stealing.\n\n&gt;C: *reads off text message*\n\n&gt;M: Ok, so it sounds like you may have unlimited data on your account. This text message that you're sent.....\n\n&gt;C: *interrupts* I don't give 2 f's about what the text means. Do you know you're costing ME money?\n\n&gt;M: Ok, while I do understand about your issue with the text message, I don't understand what you mean by we're costing you money. This text is not interrupting your service, and you're not on a plan that would cost you money per text message sent. Additional -Carrier-'s automated texts we send you regarding any of your monthly services are free and do not cost our customers a penny.\n\n&gt;C: I don't give a f about what you're saying. You will f-ing stop stealing from me and you will stop f-ing stealing from me you f-ing a-holes.\n\n&gt;M: Ok sir, we are absolutely not stealing from you, despite what you may believe. As stated, the texts we send you are free of cost to all of our customers, and as much as I would love to stop these text messages from happening, there is a regulated mandate that dictates that we have to advise our customers accordingly once you've hit certain thresholds to give you enough time to modify your usage so you're not impacted by data speed reductions.\n\n&gt;C: No, you're f-ing stealing from me. Charging me for these damn text messages and then f-ing robbing me with your exorbitant pricings for your plans. And then you're annoying the living hell out of me with these f-ing texts too. You're wasting my time.\n\n&gt;M: Ok, while I do understand about the pricing for your plan, I could assist in choosing a plan best suited for you based on your usage history and then this will stop that one text message about your usage, but in return you will gain an additional 2 more because that plan gets a different set of notifications for that. But in order to even talk about the account, you need to be able to validate it, to which we still have not been able to do.\n\nThis was a 35 minute call going back and forth from the very beginning, with him arguing about how we were stealing from him because our prices are \"ridiculously expensive\" and that we were secretly charging him for the free carrier texts. The call ultimately reached the point where I was fed up with him.\n\n&gt;M: Ok, well, here's the information that I can provide you. With the plan you're on judging from the text you sent. If you continue to abuse the cellular network and use the amount of data you have been, you will continue to get this same text message. (He was trying to interrupt, but by this time I had enough and I talk loud enough that I easily drown out whoever is trying to talk to me). If you continue to use it to the point in which you exceed the limit imposed by -Carrier-, this message will 100% apply to you. Whether you want it to happen or not, this message will be sent to you. Month, after month, after month, to which point if you try to block the texts like you stated you would earlier, they will continue to keep coming because these are carrier messages and override any software blocks you may have on the line. Additionally, we are not stealing from you in the least bit. You and the account holder, to which your name isn't on the bill so you are not even responsible for anything, have signed up for this plan. This plan was presented to you in a way that it was broken down and you decided to agree to start service with us. At no point in this process did -Carrier- change any prices for these plans, as we would send you yet another free text message advising you of the increase and your options available to you. Now. Unless you have other questions about your wireless account, I'd be happy to assist with those, but if you wish to pursue this issue any further, my answers will be the same. Do you have anything further?\n\n&gt;C: Yeah, you're going to have to hang up on me man. I'm not going anywhere because either you're going to hang up on me and I call right back or I'm going to annoy you till you give me the answer I want (yes, he really did say that).\n\n&gt;M: Ok, I cannot hang up with you, but if you keep bringing up the same question, the same answer and response will keep being reiterated to you. Do you have anything OTHER than that?\n\n&gt;C: No, I'm just going to keep calling back over and over. I'll call 5-10 times a day till SOMEONE gets it taken care of.\n\n&gt;M: Well we are a specialty team who processes anything related to that. If you keep calling in regarding that, you will keep getting back to us through transfers and we will all advise you accordingly. If you feel you must call 5-10 times a day to hear the same information I told you, feel free to do so, but our answers will not change. Anything else?\n\n&gt;C: No, not like you did much.\n\n&gt;M: Ok. Thanks for calling. We appreciate your call and business. Enjoy your afternoon.\n\nAll in all, a ridiculously long call for absolutely no reason. Refused to verify, then because refusal to verify, it turned into offering the ability to change stuff if he did verify, and then him refusing, accusing us of stealing, and then repeating himself like a parrot. There were more vulgarities thrown around in there in the spots that I didn't include where he kept going on and on and on about how one of his friends, refused to provide a contact number (surprise surprise), had called in and did the same thing to stop the text from happening. Insufferable people are the worst.\n\nEdit: Holy formatting batman.",

This time it was definitely from the volunteer. He was requesting that I send security to him because he had run out of pens and needed somebody to deliver some more pens to him. I did not send security on pen delivery duty, I directed him to the head of volunteer services. *eye roll*\n\nThe stories I have are incredible and I've only been here for a month.",

        "text": "Hi guys, I'm kinda new to this and I hope my story fits here:\n\nBackground: At the time of this story I was 16. As part of my school work experience I managed to get a week in the tech support section of a call center. My cousin was in HR and she got me the place (this is somewhat relevant). This occurred on the Wednesday, I began on the Monday and finished the following Friday.\n\n$ME = self explanatory\n$HR = My cousin who worked in HR\n$IT = The guy from tech support who was guiding/working with me\n$User = The individual who's phone needed fixing\n\nI was enjoying my time in work experience, chatting with the other IT personnel and we decided to do a few tickets during the lunch break (IT had different time lunch break than other workers). $ME and $IT went out to the desk and immediately found our problem. $IT simply picked up the phone and plugged it in.\n\nHowever due to something I cant claim to understand when you plug in a phone it gets 2 IP addresses and therefore needs to be reset inside the tech support room. I waited at the desk to make sure it worked whilst $IT went to do his magic in the IT room. During this time $User returned and the following occurred:\n\n$User: *ahem* That's my seat.\n$ME: *moving to seat next to desk* I am just waiting on a phone call as we are fixing your phone.\n$User: Yeah, you broke my phone last week\n$ME: Oh yeah it was just unplugged, we plugged it back in and we are assigning it to its IP address.\n$User: *voice raising* Why did you break it?\n$ME: We didn't break it we are just fixing it for you. (Big mistake:\n$User: NO! *stands up and leans over me threateningly* I SAW YOU IN HERE LAST WEEK MESSING WITH MY PHONE, WHY DO YOU DAMN KIDS HAVE TO ALWAYS MESS WITH MY STUFF (I realize now that hes blaming me (someone half his age and still a school student) for doing something which I cannot physically have done)\n\nAt this point I began to feel threatened with him standing over me shouting so I turned my chair 180º to put it between me and him, got up and walked to the IT room. $IT asks me why I've come back because somebody needs to check the phone to see if it works. I explained what happened to him. He got up, told me to follow him and point out $User. When we got out I pointed him out.\n\n$IT: Excuse me,\n$User: Finally someone whos got a few brain cells to rub together. This ****ing fool here broke my phone and then ran away when I asked him how long it would take to fix.\n$IT: Is that what happened $ME ?\n$User: (interrupting) Dont ask that fool *puts his hand on my shoulder to push me aside*\n\n$IT reaches to push the hand away from me and ends up getting pushed away. Both $User and $IT start facing up to each other and begin to push.\n\n$ME: (to a supervisor visible with their glowing yellow lanyard) hey, can you give us a hand\n\nBoth $IT and $User are pushed apart and I'm sent into a meeting room. A while later $HR walks in and asks what happened, I recount my tale of events and she tells me that $User claimed I hit him which started the altercation. As $HR was my cousin she believed my truthful account of events and told me that $IT said the same. I was sent to the IT room under strict orders not to return to the call centre floor until everything was sorted out.\n\nThe following morning I was tasked with deleting disabled users accounts, these were all the accounts that were disabled but not yet deleted. Guess who's name was at the bottom; $User\n\n\nI hope this fits your requirements.",

I work for our company's \"call center\" (we are more like phone reception for all of our offices than anything else). This is a transportation company and until last Friday, didn't have any calls I felt would be worth sharing. And then, Friday happened... \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBackground: I've been with the company for a few years and am the team lead for our department. I usually let people have their say and forward the concern to the appropriate manager without much feedback or speculation on my part and I generally don't mind putting up with people's gross exaggerations. Sorry for the length in advance!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nU: uncherrycola (me)\n\nC: customer\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**u:** Good morning, thank you for calling Transit Company. This is uncherrycola, how can I help you?\n\n**c:** (While I'm mid-greeting...) Hello, are you *a human?*\n\n*Silence*\n\n**u:** Uh, yes, ma'am... How may I help you?\n\n**c:** I need to make a complaint about something that shouldn't have happened at one of your parking lots.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis isn't unheard of... We take complaints, complements, questions about schedules, policies, etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**u:** Okay, what is it that happened?\n\n**c:** The other night I arrived at your parking lot after midnight and there were cars parked on either side of mine. That was fine, that's normal! Then, the next night, there was a funeral home car parked next to me... A *funeral. home. car* That doesn't look good for your company and I'm suffering from it now!!\n\n**u:** Okay...\n\n**c:** I almost peed myself, I almost threw up, I'm suffering from anxiety attacks, I'm having nightmares. This is horrible. I made the driver stay in the lot until I got in my car and I just left, I didn't even wait for the car to warm up! (note: we're in the NE part of the US and last week was warm). This isn't a way to represent your business at all. What kind of company lets a funeral home park their car in their parking lot?\n\n**u:** There was a hearse parked next to you? Ma'am if they are a paying customer and have a paid parking permit for our lot and have done nothing wrong, they have every right to use the lot.\n\n**c:** But it was a funeral home car, **a funeral home car!** And it said macabre on it!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, at this point, I'm a little unsure of what she said because she has an accent...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**u:** I'm sorry, ma'am, the car said what on it?\n\n**c:** It said macabre, **MACABRE!**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI like to think I'm a pretty well-rounded educationally but for some reason, I either hadn't heard that word or just don't remember hearing it. But, we have access to use Google so while she's repeating herself, I'm typing in what I think she says...\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**u:** Ma'am, the car said macabre on it?\n\n**c:** Yes! And that is just horrible and I have anxiety from it now and your company is horrible for letting some funeral home park their car there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd this is when I begin instant messaging a couple of co-workers to listen in to what is happening and hoping the call will end soon because I am holding back some serious laughter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**u:** Ma'am if the car says macabre on it, I really don't think that it would be a hearse from a funeral home. Funeral homes don't typically have such language on their vehicles.\n\n**c:** You don't understand, I am fearing for my life. What if there was someone in it? What if someone were waiting for me?\n\n**u:** I understand your concern but even if the car were from a funeral home, and I don't think it is based on what you're telling me, I'm sure they wouldn't be leaving a body in the car to take our transportation to Big City.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I can hear co-workers about in tears\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**c:** Well, they shouldn't be allowed to be there at all! It is bad for your business.\n\n**u:** Ma'am, as I've said, if they are a paying customer, just as yourself, and they've also paid to be able to park there and they haven't done anything wrong, we can't ask them to leave or kick them out.\n\n**c:** I want to be contacted back about this, this is not normal! Who drives one of those. I want to know if this is someone who is up to no good.\n\n**u:** Well, I have seen normal people driving vehicles like that before as their personal vehicle.\n\n**c:** WHAT? What are you talking about?\n\n**u:** People will buy them used and drive them around as their personal vehicle. I'm not saying it's frequent but I have seen it before.\n\n**c:** What if there would have been someone in it? What if there was a coffin in it?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm dying here trying not to laugh in her ear. At this point, we're 6 minutes into the call.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**u:** Well, ma'am as I've said, based on what you've told me, it doesn't sound like a car from a funeral home and even if it were, I'm sure they wouldn't have left a body in the car to go to Big City. I understand your concern and I will happily give your information to our General Manager, Safety Director, and Terminal Director so they can review everything and they'll be in touch with you.\n\n**c:** Fine. Thank you. I guess that's all you can do. But, this looks bad for your company!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe hang up and I miss the next call because I am laughing so hard at how bizarre the last nearly 8 minutes of my life were... I take a couple of calls and the phone rings again.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**u:** Good morning, thank you for calling Transit Company. This is uncherrycola, how can I help you?\n\n**c:** Hi this is Crazy Customer. I'd like to make a complaint.\n\n**u:** Yes ma'am, what would it be about?\n\n**c:** I just called your terminal about an issue I had the other night in their parking lot.\n\n**u:** Yes ma'am, I'm familiar with the issue, I just spoke with you a few minutes ago.\n\n**c:** I just called Other Location and asked to speak to the head of security and they asked me for my information like my name and number!!\n\n**u:** Okay, and what is the issue with that ma'am?\n\n**c:** Why wouldn't she just put me through to that person? Why does she need my information?\n\n**u:** Well, ma'am they need your contact information in case they can't reach the person you are looking for and she wanted more information to make sure she was putting you in touch with the correct person to make sure your complaint/concern was handled appropriately. They have to follow the same procedure that I am following and they would have been sharing your concern with same people that I am to have it looked into.\n\n**c:** Well, **I'D STILL LIKE TO MAKE A COMPLAINT ABOUT HER**\n\n**u:** Yes, ma'am. What would you like me to forward the complaint about?\n\n**c:** The person who I talked to! She was rude, wouldn't let me talk, was cutting me off. She just kept talking and wouldn't let me speak at all. She's not giving me the time to express my concerns and not giving me the respect I deserve as a customer!\n\n**u:** I truly apologize that was your experience with her. Do you know who you spoke with?\n\n**c:** Uh, *no!* She had *an attitude* and sounded African-American!\n\n**u:** I'm sorry ma'am?\n\n**c:** She had an attitude and sounded African-American! And, what if something would have happened to me that night? I watched a TV show the other day where men are waiting in cars and *they're just taking people.* What if that would have happened? I could have been dead or kidnapped! Your security cameras wouldn't have been able to prevent an attack or save me, would they? Wouldn't have been much help after the fact, huh?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, I'm now getting annoyed that I am still wasting time with this same issue and she just will not stop talking!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**u:** Crazy Customer, I apologize again that this has been your experience but as I let you know earlier, I am forwarding this information *in detail* to the general manager, safety director, and terminal director. I will now also include the complaint about the agent in the terminal. Is there anything else I can help you with (I don't often hate asking this question but that day, I just wanted done)?\n\n**c:** Ugh, no. Just have someone look into it and call me!\n\n**u:** Yes, ma'am. Thank you for letting us know and have a great weekend.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis was easily the most amusing and crazy call I have taken in the entire time I've been with this company... And the biggest waste of 15 minutes between the two calls.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdited for formatting",

        "text": "Hey all~\n\nIt's been a year since I made the following post (https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/4p9z2x/ive_joined_you_guys/) about joining a Call Center.\n\nMany people said it was a terrible decision and that I should re-consider, but I want to explain a better side to things.\n\nIf you haven't read the above post, then know that I had left University, and honestly everything else, behind for this job. Was it an insane idea? Yeah. Was it a bad idea? Not in the slightest.\n\nHow can that be at a job that's seen as a dead end? Nowhere to go? No degree? Well, it's what you really do with it and what type of Call Center you work at. Seeing just this thread alone tells me that most Call Center jobs are... well, they don't lead to many places. But some actually do. \n\nWhen you're working on certificates such as the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and already have others such as the SY0-401 (Security +), while making a bit more than the average 4 year degree graduate... well, it tends to be something that changes your view from the norm.\n\nAlthough, there are still obvious cons. I work mostly dealing with trying to resolve Security Vulnerabilities on a Merchant's network. If you guys pull your hair out trying to explain how to create a password, try telling that same person how to disable Cipher Suites. Sometimes these people just... I question how they can claim they are \"Secure\" when they follow up with \"I plugged it into the wall!\"\n\nOr \"I.T.\" people calling in asking what a Port is. Let's not get into that one.\n\nOther cons? I also gained weight :x Not gonna lie there. Going from a job at a gym to sitting down all day kinda does that... please exercise! I'm on the track to losing it again but don't get to that point to begin with. \n\nI'm not sure what else to say. If you got an opportunity even if it seems insane, go for it? It depends though. Life before given this chance was quite terrible, so jumping for this actually helped immensely.\n\nFor those trying to better themselves to get out of a Call Center, I wish you luck and hope everything works out for you!",

        "text": "Specifically, their ability to take time out of their day to make everything much harder for themselves. This is gonna involve a decent amount of backstory, but I think the payoff will be worth it.\n\nThis is an email interaction, but to my knowledge, talesfrompaymentcompanies doesn't exist yet, so... \n\nSo I work for a company that partners with several other companies to process their online orders and payments. This customer, Asshole, bought some software by SoftWarez (name obviously changed) a year ago, and the license lasts for a year, and after a year they will need to repurchase if they want to continue using the product. We were contacted by SoftWarez who asked us to contact Asshole. Asshole apparently called SoftWarez and stated that he had made another purchase, but the order couldn't be found by them. We sent a proactive email to the customer stating basically the same: we weren't able to locate any recent orders, could he kindly provide proof of payment (date and last four of charge or a blacked-out copy of the bank statement). \n\nThe customer's first email back was already aggressive: what a rubbish response, I've fucking told you that I paid, why did you take my fucking money and are refusing to deliver the product you assholes, blah blah blah, and herE'S MY RECEIPT. \n\nHe sent us a copy of the receipt he had gotten... I did some digging and found out that someone at SoftWarez had resent the receipt from last year in error. Great. So I sent a polite (but straightforward) email back to him explaining that hey, looks like you were sent the receipt from last year, so sorry, that's confusing, we still can't find a recent order, kindly provide your payment information, use appropriate language in any further communications, any other emails containing vulgar language will not receive a response. \n\nWhat we got back was a long, detailed, and yes, profanity-laden response. I will not quote the entire thing for privacy (also it's really long), but have a snippet: \n\nYou couldn't locate your own ass - even if it was on fire. But, go ahead, you cunt: locate the fucking charge, or don't locate it. I don't give a fuck. Because the fact that you're incapable with respect to the basic administration skills required to run a business, isn't my fault you cunt. And, by god, it certainly does NOT provide you with any legal cover regarding this matter. You messed with the wrong customer asshole. You stupid, fucking bitch. You pompous, self-righteous, arrogant, piece of shit. You fucking ugly cunt. Enjoy the rest of your day motherfucker - and remember: you are going to fucking pay for what you've done. Because not only are you an asshole, but you're also the dumbest bitch I've met. You are so fucking stupid - you really thought you could get away with this; you actually thought you could get away with this?\n\nSo... yeah. \n\nTrue to our word, we marked it as a no-reply-needed, and now I amuse myself by picturing this guy going to his lawyer and having a lawyer telling him he's off his rocket.

I do a cursory check of my procedure and see nothing against it and change it. \n\nThen I get to scheduling. The provider I just assigned him doesn't have any appointments and my directions are pretty clear to transfer to the clinic if that's the case. So I call them up only to get yelled at by a bitchy nurse (BN). \n\nMe: Hi, this is UmbraCelestia from the contact center. I have this patient's mother on the line and she asked to change his primary care provider to Dr. XYZ as he had been seen by her last week but there are currently no appointments for her. \n\nBN: you changed his PCP? You can't do that!\n\nMe: [Thinking she thought I didn't have the physical permissions in the system to change that field] Yeah I can. \n\nBN: No! You're not supposed to do that! Our procedures say you can't change the patient's PCP in our clinic! Why did you change that? \n\nMe: uh, your procedure doesn't say that at all actually. \n\nBN: Yes it does! It says it clear as day. Just schedule the patient with a resident. Can you handle that instruction!\n\nMe: (thinking: really?) I'll schedule her. \n\n----\n\nI pulled my supervisor over after the call and had him look too. Nowhere in the entire procedure did it say not to change the primary care provider. This lady didn't know what the fuck she was talking about. You'd better believe I reported her bitchy ass. ",

The business was a pharmacy with an automatic system (the IVR) to refill prescriptions. That wasn't working. So, after doing the standard verification processes, he tells me that a CUSTOMER IS TRYING TO REFILL HER PRESCRIPTION and she is the one calling.\n\nN: So, a customer wants to refill her prescription... it isn't working.\n\nMe: Has she contacted the pharmacy?\n\nN: No, she knew that ISP was Pharmacy's ISP, so she figured they supported phone issues too.\n\nMe: Please advise this woman to call the pharmacy directly to tell them that the IVR isn't working. We cannot help her in a situation like this. Especially when Pharmacy is part of a much bigger company.\n\nN: Okay, thank you.

But, because of the woman calling the ISP for a PHONE issue and not alerting the pharmacy first.\n",

And I'm not talking a few headlines. No. he starts with the date at the top and did not stop until he had read the /entire newspaper/. \nIf I interrupted, he started over.

This is great, as the vast majority of customers know the processes and what we can and can't do in terms of delivery, how returns work, etc\n\nBut every now and again you get someone filling in for the regular ordering person, or someone new to the process. And of course, the occasional pants on head, batshit crazy valued customer.\n\nToday's tale is about the latter.\n\nMe: Standard greeting!\n\nCustomer: Standard info - account number, name, placing an order.\n\nAs I'm taking her order she's checking I have each and every line correct. Unusual, but not unheard of. She's possibly had a history of errors on her orders. However she is getting noticeably irritated as the order goes on. About 6 lines in she stops me:\n\nC: You're not taking down my order!\n\nM: Excuse me? We've verified every product and quantity. I can repeat what we have so far?\n\nC: No! There's no way you're typing in every product. I can hear you typing, you're only hitting 4 or 5 keys. There's no way you're typing all this in.\n\nM: Customer, I want to clarify. Every product has a 3 digit code, all I have to do is enter the code, then the quantity. I don't have to type in the full product name.\n\nC: No.\n\nM: Sorry, was there something you didn't understand?\n\nC: No.\n\nM: .....OK? Did you want to continue with your order?\n\nC: No.\n\nM: Customer, how would you like to proceed?\n\nC: I want you to take my order. Write it down. I don't want you making up bullshit about codes. I know how this works, I order every week. I've never heard of this code nonsense. Everyone always types my order IN FULL. \n\nWhile she's ranting I check the accounts order history. She does indeed order every week, and there's no notes about her being a lunatic. I'm really, really confused at this point.\n\nM: Customer, I assure you I'm taking down your order. We've never had to type out the entire product, the system recognizes each code, I can....\n\nC: NO! NONONONONONO! I TOLD YOU, ENOUGH OF THIS CODE BULLSHIT! TAKE MY ORDER OR - magic words - TRANSFER ME TO YOUR BOSS!\n\nM: *Grinning* Absolutely, one moment!\n\nMy supervisor is extremely professional but takes zero bullshit. I put looney tunes on hold and let him know what the deal is. He's as dumbfounded as I am, but composes himself and takes the call. I can overhear his end of the conversation, but that's all I need to hear. He's having the same conversation I did, and by the time she's worked herself up to incoherent screeching he's just leaning back and letting her wear herself out. At one point he checks Facebook. Then a generic news site. She's still screeching, I can hear it through his earpiece, 4 desks away.\n\nSup: OK customer, I just want to clarify here - you say thickeysfw was making up fairy tales about codes and wouldn't take your order. Correct? \n\nC: Yes (I assume)\n\nSup: Customer, you're wrong. We do not, and never have, typed out product names. I don't know where you got that information  from, but it's factually incorrect. Here's how we're going to proceed. I'm going to transfer you back to thickeysfw. He's going to take the rest of your order, using the same codes we've used for almost a decade. NO CUSTOMER, I'M TALKING NOW. You will receive your order tomorrow. We will send you a confirmation as soon as your order is submitted. If anything is incorrect call us immediately and ask for me, we will get the correct order out to you on a same day courier.\n\nSo customer is transferred back to me, irritable but co-operative.  I complete and confirm the order, email her a confirmation, and wait on the line while she checks it. Everything is in order. I leave notes on her account, supervisor gives me 5 minutes to facepalm. \n\nTL;DR - crazy lady thinks we type out entire product names, looses her mind when told otherwise.\n\nEdit - a few pointed out my goof addressing this sub as TFTS, I was reading a few posts over there before posting this. To quote a hopeful presidential candidate, oops.",

All I can do is send a message. \n\nCC: I want to speak to your supervisor!\n\n----\nIt never fails to amuse me how patients seem to have this idea that their providers are just sitting around twiddling their thumbs waiting for a patient to call. It's immensely entitled to tell someone that you don't care if the provider is with another patient because you think you're more important. \n\nOh and I checked later. The supervisor I connected him with did the exact same thing I would have done, i.e. sent a message. And the best part? All the guy wanted was for the physical therapist to clarify the patient's exercise reps. ",

        "text": "I work for a Call Center for a drone company. I had a customer call me about a faulty drone, and I asked him about the model of the drone, and what was wrong with it, turns out it was damaged on shipping to the retailer. From what he described, the drone took off perpendicular in contrast to being vertical, and the drone flew into a tree. I offered a 30% discount on repairs, as I was worried of being too overbearing to the point I get reprimanded. He turns down the offer initially, so I closed the case, and then he **reneges** and accepts the offer. I asked for a picture of the receipt, and the damaged drone, but suddenly he turns back around and starts questioning my ethics. Over the course of a week, I asked my supervisor about this customer, and my supervisor said that I can go ahead and offer a full repair kit **AND** a new drone to the customer. When he contacted us again (and recommended to me), he started to, once again, call my ethics and complain about the business model. He proceeded to basically say \"no, yes, no, yes\" to the drone offer. Then he asked for the old offer (30% discount on repairs). I told him that he cannot have both offers, but the offer is still on the table. He again sent me on another \"ring around the rosie\", so I told him he needs to make a decision within the next 5 business days, he told me to \"suck a dick\". I told him \"ok sir, you're no longer welcome to call back, and the offers are now non-standing, have a good day\". He's now blacklisted. ",

        "text": "Good day all fellow call center folk. I just stumbled upon this thread today. However my story is only a month or so ago. \n\nI am a supervisor in life insurance that has variable policies. Meaning that the value of the account can be \"vested\" in sub accounts. Now if you are not familiar with this all trades or transfers must be completed and confirmed prior to 4pm just like the stock market. \n\nWell I got an escalated call about 4:10-4:15. The rep told me it was an agent that wanted to do a trade but didn't make it in time. I'll admit I did giggle a bit as I knew there was nothing I could do to help so I told him to put them through to me. \n\nSo he comes through hot and heavy about how he has been transferred around and on the phone for 30-45 minutes. ( We including me monitor the queues and this wouldn't happen). So I indulge him a bit and listen to his rant. I told him I understand his frustration and I'd be more than happy to put in the request effective the next business day. He vehemently declines and says that is unacceptable that his client has millions of money with my company. I did check the name but only this one account showed. I asked him what he would like me to do for him. Which he replied to make the trade effective that day. I informed him that was not possible for compliance purposes and that aside from calling he could have done this online or faxed/emailed in a form. He then said it was not acceptable and his client would take his business elsewhere and hung up.\n\nTurns out the next day he called back in and completed his request. Also I pulled his phone call as I wanted to confirm when he did indeed call in. He called at 3:57 and asked when the market closed at 4 or 4:30. \n\nPSA: I speak with too many uninformed \"financial advisors\" that don't know what they are doing or what they are selling. Please do your research and trust who tells you what to do with your money.",

Nothing special, but it kinda made me grin.\n\n&gt;Me: [College] IT Helpdesk, this is Quill, how can I help you?\n\n&gt;Caller: Yeah hi, I'm an instructor for [College] for Kids, I was gonna ask [Specific Campus] IT if they had an empty computer lab.\n\nOkay, not the most unusual thing ever, a lot of the kid summer programs use computer labs, but I did wonder a.) who left this teacher high and dry like that and b.) why she was calling tech support to book a computer lab, we have the keys but usually it's a different department that schedules room use.\n\n&gt;Me: Wait, a whole computer lab? I don't really...\n\n&gt;Caller: Yeah, just like ten or eleven computers - I had all outdoor activities planned for today but with the heat advisory and all...\n\n&gt;Me: Ohhh, got it.\n\nI'd love to say we're having a heat wave in my state right now, but no, it's just June. It's supposed to be up around/over 110F all week, and even the construction projects in at least one part of town have been postponed until August. Forget outdoor activities.\n\nSo I'm starting into the info-gathering spiel, just making sure I can give [Campus] something to run with, and she's fading in and out. Also not unusual, this campus is *way* out in the boonies and we often have to half-shout a conversation when the caller's on a cell. Finally, I have to interrupt because I can hardly hear her at all.\n\n&gt;Me: I'm sorry, I think we have a bad connection, where did you say--\n\n&gt;Caller: \\*slightly shouting* Oh my god are you okay!?\n\n&gt;Me: \\*thrown off, stares at phone* W-wha...? \\*what, did she think I dropped dead?*\n\n&gt;Caller: *Put down that sword!*\n\n&gt;Me: ...\n\n&gt;Caller: Okay, everybody put down your swords right now, no more swords, we're done! \\*pulls phone away from face and continues to scold kids in the background*\n\nFinally my brain catches on and I give an involuntary snort. Oh. Hadn't realized she was actually in class right then.\n\n&gt;Caller: \\*a couple more seconds of ranting and are-you-okay, finally gets back to the phone with a nervous little laugh* Hah, yeah, so... gotta do something with these kids...\n\n&gt;Me: Not a problem, I'll call the campus cell.\n\nShe gives me that genuine, harried thank you of a slightly overwhelmed daycare teacher and I'm still grinning as I dial [Campus] IT.

When last we left our hero, he was stuck working in the Golog of internet technical support. While we are still doing that, upper management decided that since we were SOOO much better at working with these customers on internet support, why not add Cable TV support as well.\n\n\nUnfortunately none of us had ever been trained on cable TV support, nor were we really ever adequately trained in the billing system that is used for this area of the country. This created many headaches and the requirement of retraining. But as we all know, you never get enough training when you need it.\n\n\nThis story is going to be from mid-late 2012, so we are a couple of months past the last one.\n\n\ncast:\nMe: self explanatory\nSM: SmartyMcSmart man AKA the customer\nTech 1: local tech in the NYC area\nSup: Male sup who is Male, this actually becomes important\n\n\n&gt;me:*whisper tone tells me this is a cable TV support call* Thank you for calling ISP national help desk, this is Peopleman_at_work. So that I can best assist you, can you please tell me your name and the telephone number starting with the area code that is on your account?\n\n\n&gt;sm: yes, my name is NAME, and my phone number is XXX-XXX-XXXX. And before i begin I would really like you to know that I am not an idiot! So please do not ask me to unplug anything, or turn the channel!\n\n\n&gt;me: Don't worry sir, I have no intention of doing so. What seems to be your issue tonight?\n\n\n&gt;sm: Well, none of my pron channels are coming in. My wife isn't here to help me and I need to take care of business!\n\n\n&gt;me:*kind of skeved out* OK. I'm sorry that those channels are not working for you. If you will just give me 1-2 minutes to look over your account that would be appreciated.\n\n\n&gt;sm: Fine, but make it snappy, the Viagra is wearing off!\nputs call on mute\n\n\n&gt;me:*sigh, thinks this is what my life has come to? helping a guy get off?* **so I open up the customers account in our super spiffy app that is nice and graphical, but can't really do anything other then make it easier to read codes on the account It looks like the codes are on the account, so I'm not sure what is going on...**\n\n\n&gt;sm: *thinking he is on hold, and just in silence* Why can't anyone ever fix this shit. This company is just horrible, I should have gone with $magicalskycompany.\n\n\n&gt;me: Thank you for holding sir, So it does look like the codes are on the account, let me just send some signals to the cable box and make sure that everything is refreshed in the system. *sends hits to cable box*\n\n\n&gt;sm: WTF! I told you that I wasn't going to restart anything! My box just restarted on it own!!!!\n\n\n&gt;me: Yes sir, I was trying to accommodate your request for YOU to not have to restart anything, so I did it remotely. *smile*\n\n\n&gt;sm: I know for a fact that you can fix this without doing so. I know its just that your company is working with my wife, she doesn't like it when I have alone time. She wants me only to do this kind of thing with her!\n\n\n&gt;me: I can assure you that i have no idea what you are talking about, I have never spoken to your wife.\n\n\n&gt;sm: The cable box is back up and running, do you want me to check to make sure I can access my pron?\n\n\n&gt;me: yes sir, please go to one of those channels?\n\n\n&gt;sm: You stupid SOB, its still not working.\n\n\n&gt;me: Ok sir, please hold again, I am going to ask someone in the local area if there is any issue with these channels.\n\n\n&gt;sm: Fine, but make it quick.\n\n\n**puts call on hold**\n\n\n&gt;me: *sigh, lets hope this doesn't take to long to get someone local* Puts in call to local tier 1 support\n\n\n&gt;tech 1: Thank you for calling local TV support, this is tech 1, how can I assist you?\n\n\n&gt;me: Hey tech 1, this is me from National help desk. I have a customer on the line that is having problems getting some pron. Do you know of any issues with those channels in NYC?\n\n\n&gt;tech 1: Nothing has been reported! Want me to check his billing?\n\n\n&gt;me: That would be awesome, we really didn't get much training on the system.\n\n\n&gt;tech 1: Ok, so the codes are there, but they are assigned to the modem. Let me just balance his account, and send some hits.\n\n\n&gt;me: Thank you.\n\n\n&gt;tech 1: all done!\n\n\n*ends call and goes back to SM*\n\n\n&gt;sm: The f***ing box did it again! Why are they so incompetent?\n\n\n&gt;me: Hello sm, thank you for holding. As you can see we had to reboot the cable box one more time. We found that the codes were not assigned to the correct equipment, once this restart is completed we should have you up and running.\n\n\n&gt;sm: So she got you to change the codes did she? Well, I will just have to tell her that she wasn't effective in stopping me this time.\n\n\n&gt;me: Ok, please let me know when the cable box is back up.\n\n\n&gt;sm: its back on, let me check the pron. Hey, its working. Now I can get off!\n\n\n&gt;me: That's, umm, excellent sir. is there anything else that I can help you with?\n\n\n&gt;sm: Yes, how are you going to compensate me for my pain/suffering, and time without the channel?\n\n\n&gt;me: I can look into that for you! \n\n*part of the program that is supposed to let us see coding easily, also comes with this nice calculator function that will figure out credits for us. We don't have to use it, we can just issue any whole dollar amount we want, but this guy has just been off this whole time. so I decide to figure out the credit to the penny.\nAfter inputting all the data, it comes back with a figure of $3.12. I go back to sm*\n\n\n&gt;me: sm, I have that amount. I will be able to credit your account $3.12 for the time and suffering, would you like me to do that?\n\n\n&gt;sm: that is unacceptable. You will give me at least 1 full months credit for all services.\nme: Sir, I cannot justify that. According to my system you are due $3.12.\n\n\n&gt;sm: Get me over to your manager, and make sure its a MAN. I'm tired of dealing with females such as yourself. \n\n\n*now dear reader, I didn't select my name of peopleMAN_at_work to be deceiving, I am in fact male, but I will admit, I have a high pitched voice.*\n\n\n&gt;me: sir, you have been talking to a man, but if you will hold I will see if I can transfer you to a male supervisor.\n\n\n&gt;sm: Thank you.\n\n*puts call on hold, and looks for a specific sup. He will mess with this guy if I tell him whats going on. He hates sexism!*\n\n\n&gt;me: Sup, I have an escalation, and he will only talk to a male supervisor. He was not able to get his pron channels, he accused us of blocking them on the orders of his wife. He wants a month credit, and the system says only $3.12.\n\n\n&gt;sup: well did we block them for his wife? Maybe it was a way to save their marriage? *this guy loves sarcasm, and this was dripping with it*\n\n\n&gt;me: I don't think so, I think this guy is just a creep and a perv. Will you take this call?\n\n\n&gt;sup: Sure, I'll be over, I'll take it at your desk.\n\n\n&gt;me: goes back to call Sir, I have a male sup coming over, it shouldn't be more then another minute.\n\n*Sup comes over and hands me a Y-Jack so that I can listen into both sides of this call. I make sure that my side is muted*\n\n\n&gt;sup: *said in the highest pitched falsetto voice you can imagine* Hello, this is sup from ISP. I hear you were having problems accessing your pron channels, and now that we fixed it you thought we should give you a month credit.\n\n\n&gt;sm: I was told that you would be male, only a man can understand my difficulties getting off.\n\n\n&gt;sup: *still in same voice* well I can understand the frustrations of not getting off. Unfortunately I can't compensate you for that. and the system will only allow a $3.12 credit to be applied. That is as high as anyone will give you.\n\n\n&gt;sm: this is unacceptable. Transfer me to cancellations. I am leaving your shitty company.\n\n\n&gt;sup: Please hold, we will transfer you.\n\n\n&gt;sm: yes you will!\n\n\n&gt;sm: *to me* just dump him into the retention line.\n\n\nAnd this is where the call ends for me. my supervisor told me to take an extra 15 minutes break on the clock due to this idiot, but I didn't. I found this whole interaction quite funny. I actually had trouble containing laughter the entire call.",

        "text": "Thought of another one. So yeah, I dispatch roadside service for people covered under their vehicle's manufacturer warranty. Basically complimentary service. One of the things we can provide is a fuel delivery. Say you simply forgot to fill up on your way to work or your fuel gage is messing up and you ran out or maybe your truck is hauling a trailer and you didn't realize your gas mileage is severely effected by that, we can send someone out with basically the bare minimum amount of fuel to get you to the nearest gas station so you're not stranded. We used to do this I believe 10 times a year for free but too many people abused it and would demand fuel when they weren't even out of fuel yet and were parked in their driveway. Now we do 3 times a year which I'd say is still a fair deal.\n\n\n\nAnyways, got a caller recently who ran out of gas on the interstate and managed to get pulled over to the shoulder. They had Onstar who transferred them to us and Onstar had already called the police to come make sure the customer (who sounded like a 20 something year old girl and understandably scared) was safe.\nAsked her a few questions to verify the vehicle and location and make sure she knew she was only covered for such and such amount of fuel and would need to immediately drive to a gas station to fill up the rest of the way. Confirmed her callback, placed her on a maybe 2 minute hold while I found someone who could be out in like 30 minutes. We're contractually obligated to accept anything under 60 minutes and typically 30 minutes is the best you can shoot for.\nPick her up off hold and giver her the name of the company and how long they'll be out and remind her that they are not to charge her for the service and such.\nShe very stiffly just goes \"Ok. Got it. Cool.\" like she wants me off her line immediately. Then on another phone I can hear her start talking to someone else and giving them info to set up a dispatch. I think nothing of it since people usually call us and then call their auto insurance or AAA all the time to see which one gets their faster. Fair enough. I'd probably do the same if I could.\n\nCome to find out she was talking to someone else a few seats away from me. And after she set up with them, she had already called back on her second phone and basically was repeating this process nonstop without telling any of us that she had already called in. Normally we'd notice but since her info was being loaded directly as a fresh call the way she was calling in and pressing prompts, there was no notification to any of us that someone else was already setting up service for that customer/vehicle.\n\n\nA few minutes after taking her call, my next call was the service provider I had reached calling me back to say they had accepted 3 dispatches for the same vehicle and customer. They wanted to know if they needed to take her 3 times the amount of fuel we usually cover or what was going on. I politely explained what was happening and told them I would cancel all except the earliest dispatch and to please help her as soon as possible.\n\nAs I was leaving a few minutes later, I heard someone else say they had on her on the line. By then, everyone in the center was aware and was warning each other. The next day I heard they kept doing it until their service arrived.\n\n\nLike I get being stuck on the side of a busy interstate is scary. But if you can't wait 30 minutes for a fuel delivery or if it's that dangerous where you are, call 911 for god's sake. The police had been called multiple times for her but evidently didn't get there much sooner than the provider. \n\nThe worst part is when you get a customer who's in a parking lot of perfectly safe location and gets mad as hell about a 20-30 minute ETA. Like I don't care who you are or where you are, 30 minutes is quick for any service to get to you. You're not the only person in the world who needs roadside service and we don't have tow truck drivers following you around everywhere you go waiting for you to break down. Now if you're somewhere unsafe or blocking traffic, don't expect roadside service to be able to get someone to you instantly. Go ahead and call us to set up service but call the police too.",

I do so, and go into not ready to notate this. \n\nI'm trying to reconcile this still, because, hey, I understand, can't use your service, why pay for it?

        "text": "Hi hi TFCC. LTL, FTP, acronyms. \n\nA little bit about my job first: I'm a Level II representative for a payment processing company. We partner with different companies (normally software manufacturers) and process their online payments. This means that any payment-related issues (refunds, card declined, etc.) are directed to us. I also act as a supervisor, even though I don't hold the Official Job Title, and I use that word in escalations to... lend credibility? Whatever. \n\nSo I got an escalated call today. The customer had had an unwanted automatic renewal that had overdrafted his bank account -- never fun. The Level I rep told me that he wanted us to reimburse his overdraft fee for him after issuing the refund, and that he wouldn't take no for an answer. So I take the transfer. Me = Me, C = Customer. \n\nMe: Hi, is this Customer? \n\nC: Yes\n\nMe: Hi, my name is happensherestayshere, I'm a supervisor at Payment Company, I understand we're having some problems with a refund? \n\nC: Yeah, you took the money out of my account without my permission and now I have an overdraft fee! I want a refund! \n\nMe: I'm certainly sorry to hear that you weren't expecting this. I can issue the refund if you'll just confirm your email address for me? \n\nC: Yeah, it's customer@domain.com\n\nMe: Thank you very much, I've gone ahead and initiated the refund for the full amount of the charge. You'll receive a refund confirmation within a few hours, and you can take that to your bank and I'm sure they'll refund your overdraft fees for you. \n\nC: No, I want YOU to do it! \n\nMe: Oh, I'm sorry, we don't have a way to reimburse fees charged by your bank at this time. They are the ones you charged you for those, so they are the ones who will be able to issue a refund for those fees. \n\nC: No, YOU charged me without telling me [untrue, you just didn't read your emails] and you're making millions of dollars off of this [hahahahahahaha] and YOU need to refund these! I'm not going out of my way to fix your mistake! \n\nMe: Like I said, sir, we don't have a way to refund anything other than the amount of the charge. I've already issued a refund and you should receive -- \n\nC: Well I'm not taking time out of my day because you stole from me! You can do it! \n\nMe: I can't call your bank and tell them to refund you either, sir, that would be a violation of your privacy and they would need to hear from you directly. \n\nC: Then they're going to talk to my lawyer! And your lawyer! \n\nMe: ... Hiring a lawyer is more work than simply visiting your bank, sir. \n\nC: Then refund me for my overdraft fee! \n\nMe: There physically is no way I can do that. I can only refund the full amount of your order, I can't send additional funds to your bank account. In order to do that, you will need to speak with your bank, it is out of our hands. \n\nC: This is the worst customer service I've ever had. I can't believe you won't refund this. This is the worst customer service. And I'm telling all my friends, every one I know, to not deal with (company who made the product) or Payment Company ever again! \n\nHe yelled at me a little while longer, and then hung up. \n\nHooray.

I was tricked into getting it and I am NOT paying for it. \n\nSo I read the notes on the account and see that she has already talked to a supervisor about this, and already had gotten a credit. We have a strict \"if we credit you and you accept it there are no more negotiations\" rule so I have to dig deeper and get her to see reason instead of applying more adjustments. \n\n$me: So in order for me to understand you have to give me the whole picture\n\nThe customer explains that she went over her data and a representative changed her plan so that she did not incur overages. The change was done as a courtesy after she was already billed so that is why there was a small adjustment already made, just enough to rectify overages and have her paying only for the plan. I try to explain this. \n\n$CC: THEN WHY WAS I TOLD THAT I WOULDNT HAVE TO PAY EXTRA\n\n$me: because you didn't have to pay and extra FEES, minus the temporary plan to cover your usage. \n\n$CC: WHY DOES IT COST ANY MORE THAN WHAT I PAIS PREVIOUS MONTHS\n\n$me: Well, you went over your data limit this month so the plan change was cheaper than incurring overages. \n\n$CC: THAT WASNT EXPLAINED TO ME. CREDIT ME THE $30 EXTRA BECAUSE I AM. IT PAYING\n\n$me: Then I would be wiping off the charges for the extra services you used. We would be giving you free data, and that is not something we normally do. \n\nIf she was a more tenured customer then I would have been way more flexible on this topic , but she had been with us only 6 months and called in A LOT about problems she would create and then blame us for. So no leeway. \n\n$me: you have a certain amount of gigs to use each month. If you use more than that it will cost more. You either pay per gig in overages or change your plan to mitigate costs. The representative saved you money with what they did. Then we already credited you some of it as a courtesy. You get no more money. \n\n$CC: Well you can shove it up your ass! Moron *click* \n\nNormally our policy is to call them back but I notated verbal abuse and left since I was supposed to punch out 15 minutes before. ",

I read ahead a bit and realize that this goes from Mother Goose style to the Grimm Brother's version real quick. I panic. I end the story with the wolf eating Little Red, because I can't remember how the Axeman comes into play. I can feel the \"wtf? Did he really just tell a story about how a wolf murdered 2 people and that was it?\" Awkward silence for a few seconds... \"Uhhhh... thank you.

        "text": "Hello again!\n\nBack story: I work for a large bank that finances credit cards for a big box electronics store. I am in the application processing department (credit analyst, if you will). We can also look at accounts for limit increases and things like that and see general info. Sometimes I take calls that really should go to our customer service department to avoid having to transfer the customer. That, and our customer service department can be a bit... uncooperative at times, but I digress. \n\nSo the store employee calls in, says the customer has a question about his account. So I take the account number and look at the details. Balance: $525, credit limit $500. Yep I bet he's gonna ask why he can't use it. \n\nI look into the transactions, he made a $45 payment a few days ago, but his account has an annual fee of ~$60, which was charged about a week ago. I figure this will be a simple explanation. (Mistake: never assume things in a call center). \n\nMe: (gives my dual party consent, asks his name, how can I assist you, yada yada)\n\nCustomer: Yes I am wondering why I cannot use my card, I come to the store I make a payment cash $45 I always pay on time sometimes early what is the problem.\n\nMe: Yes sir I see that the payment posted to your account a few days ago, but I see that you are over the credit limit because your annual fee was charged a week ago, so the payment didn't cover the annual fee.\n\nCustomer: So why I cannot use my card I pay cash in the store? \n\nMe: (explains again, trying to rephrase). \n\nCustomer: (explains his side again, not hearing what I'm saying about the annual fee, then proceeds to ask me, in Spanish, if I can speak Spanish.)\n\nMe: No I do not speak Spanish but I would love to get you an agent who does (we have a Spanish line for customer service who I would give anything for this guy to give me the OK to transfer to, clearly a language barrier). \n\nHe explains again that he isn't late and already paid $45 and everything. \n\nMan I just wish he would have let me maybe talk to the store rep again, or let me get someone who speaks Spanish or at least an interpreter. \n\nWe're not allowed to offer an interpreter, only when specifically requested. Anyone else's call center like this? I understand that it can be misconstrued as possibly rude but it's better to offer one in some cases because the customer may not know to ask...",

        "text": "This is actually a conversation between myself and another agent. If it's not allowed, let me know!\n\n\n\nBackground: I work for a company that processes payments from one customer to another. When the paying customer has a complaint about the paid customer, we can sometimes reverse the payment. In small terms, it's actually much bigger but this is the simple explanation.\n\n\n\nSo, on this day I am transferred a call from a customer being paid. Basically, he was irate because a previous rep took his payment after telling him he had an hour to respond to him, but ended up taking the payment after 30 minutes. Not only that, but he completely broke policy as he had to give the paid customer 24 hours to respond. This is the interaction between me (B) and the other agent (C).\n\n\n\nB: Hey C, I have Paid Customer on the line. I see here you gave him an hour to reply to you and the took his pay.\n\nC: Hi. So?\n\nB: Well policy states you must give him 24 hours, but besides that you also took his pay after 30 minutes instead of an hour ...\n\nC: wait I see here you waived his penalties?\n\nB: Well yes I stopped us charging him $100 so he is paid fully for his next transaction. This is not about the penalties it is about the $2,300 you took from him.\n\nC: No, I don't care, I can't do my job! You waived my final decision!\n\nB: ? *Looks at the ticket, there is no final decision flag applied, and C clearly messed up* there is no final decision on thi-\n\nC: NO! You undermined me! You must take this!\n\n\n\nAt this point I stop the conversation and contact his supervisor, who is just as dull as him and says since I \"overturned his final decision\" I must take the case. \n\nSo I went to my supervisor, who contacted his supervisors supervisor to have both of the agents taken care of. Meanwhile, I took the $2.3k loss because it was obvious that C is an idiot and would screw the customer over who didn't deserve it.",

Sadly, you've exhausted all your credits for the current period and no more will be issued.\n\nWoman: BUT I GOTTA TALK TO JUSTIN BIEBER MY BOYFRIEND WAH WAHWHAH\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that. (At this point I was having so much fun, I went for it) Perhaps Justin can pay your phone and that way you won't need credits. Have you considered asking him?\n\nI wish this had stunted her but she kept wailing and asking for credits. I just asked her over and over if there was anything else I could do until she hung up. At the time though, I found it hilarious. ",

        "text": "First some background. I work for a financial company for people that are \"unbanked\" which basically means they can't have a bank account or simply don't want to use big banks. Either way, we deal with a very sensitive topic, money.\n\nNow I have been working for the same company for two years at the time but only as a temp. I wanted something that I would be hired on fully time and be able to reap the benefits. I see that there is an opening for the call center and think, \"Eh how bad can it be?\" Ah, I was in for a bitter sweet treat. \n\nAfter a month of training I finally begin my job as an agent. For the 8 months that followed, I was miserable. Before every call that I received was a chant of \"i hate this job\". Call after call, day after day, insult after insult it continued. Finally I decided that I could take no more. I had no other job lined up and I had no idea what I was going to do, but I couldn't take it anymore! I had to quit! Finally one day, I got the courage and support from my family, to hold my head high and walk up to my boss and say \"I'm done. I quit.\" \n\nIt felt like two tons had been lifted from my shoulders. Immediately I was happier. Life seemed a little brighter, and I could finally do something different. I had put in my two weeks notice, so the first week I was looking for another job. I was excited and felt brand new. \n\nMonday of the second week, I got a call from an old boss. He told me that the front desk admin was leaving and wanted to see if I could take over the position. Now I do love working for this company. It has been apart of my life for three years at this point! I hated working at the call center, but adored the corporate office. Everyone was always so kind and welcoming that it was a hard offer to turn down. He told me that I started the following Monday! Perfect! I could stop my job hunt, stay with the same company, and I could be much happier!\n\nI started about a month ago, and I was right. This job is like a dream. I've made friends, I can help people without being yelled at, and I don't have to talk to customers! Or so I thought....\n\n\nThis is where the story begins. \n\n\nTuesday June 6th, 2017. A call from an unknown number reaches my phone. \n\n\nMe: Company front desk this is Josie.\n\n\nHim: Yes, I am a card holder with you guys and - \n\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, did you say that you are a customer?\n\n\nHim: Well duh. I just said I am a card holder. I have a problem. Someone stole ten thousand dollars from my account. \n\n\n*At this point my inner agent kicks in, but I have to remember that helping customers is no longer my job.*\n\n\nMe: Well, I am very sorry to hear that sir. Let me take a look and see where I can transfer you to so that someone is able to assist you better.\n\n\nHim: Okay, well there are all these transactions on my account that I didn't make. There is one from a store that I've never even heard of!\n\n\nMe: Okay sir, I understand that, but I will not be able to help you. I'll need to transfer you to the correct department.\n\n\nHim: Okay, but these transactions-\n\n\nMe: Yes sir, and I will transfer you to someone that will help you.\n\n\nHim: Okay.\n\n\n\n\nSo, I finally get this guy transferred over and I think everything is fine now. I was wrong. After I had left he had called my phone again. Obviously I was unable to answer the phone so he waited until the morning.\n\n\nWednesday June 7th, 2017 8:07am\n\n\nMe: Company front desk this is Josie. \n\n\nHim: Hi its me again. The guy I spoke to yesterday was really unhelpful and now I'm really pissed. Someone stole ten thousand dollars from my account! They went to stores I never would have gone to. *proceeds to list transactions*\n\n\nMe: I'm really sorry to hear that sir. Please let me see if I can find a supervisor that I can directly transfer you to. \n\n\nHim: Okay, but again these transactions. *again starts to list transactions*\n\n\nMe: Okay sir I'm going to transfer you over to Travis. He is a supervisor. \n\n\nHim: Okay thank you.\n\n\n\nAgain, I finally think it is over. At this point I'm pretty pissed that someone gave this guy the front desk number. Later when I am talking to Travis about what is going on with this customer he tells me that every solution that he suggested to customer he shot down. The customer worked himself up so much that instead of being happy with the solutions he was providing he hung up the phone. Oh well, hopefully he won't call back. \n\n\n\nLater that afternoon I was talking to a co-worker when I hear the phone ring. I look at who is calling and it's the same unknown number. I decide its better that I don't pick up. I've transferred him to the correct people there is no reason why he needs to be calling again. A couple of minutes pass and he calls again. I decide again I am not picking up the phone. A couple of more minutes pass by and this motherfucker calls in again. Finally I pick up the phone. \n\n\n\nMe: Company front desk this is Josie.\n\n\nHim: Josie? Like Josie and the pussycats?\n\n\nMe: Yes sir. \n\n\nHim: Okay well its me again. The guy you transferred me to this morning was an ass. I am just now completely pissed off. I want to speak to R your president.\n\n\nMe: Well sir, I am very sorry to hear that Travis was unable to provide a solution to your problem but R is not available right now. In fact, he is not even in the office.\n\n\nHim: So, you are telling me that he doesn't have time for his customers???\n\n\n*Me internally: No you half twat he really doesn't. He has more important things to worry about then your crazy ass. Furthermore, he wouldn't even know how to help you. That is not his department and he can't waste time on someone that is unwilling to help themselves.*\n\n\n\nMe: No sir, that is not what I said. I said that he is not in the office right now. I can see if someone else can help you. A higher up.\n\n\nHim: No. I want to speak to R. I have his email.\n\n\nMe: Sir, once again, he is not in the office right now. \n\n\nHim: Well, when someone is actually ready to help me you can just call *me* back. *click*\n\n\nI'm just a little dumbfounded with this guy. First of all no one *stole* ten thousand dollars from his account. He was under the impression that he would receive a ten thousand tax return from the IRS, but when Travis offered to call the IRS and inquire about the missing money the card holder refused!\n\n\nAnyway, my point is I left the call center to get away from customers and some how they keep haunting me. Did I kill a baby in my past life to deserve this??? I will never know. ",

Without that code we're not allowed to tell them pretty much anything aside from where they can find that code, that their security system has two power sources, and that if we can get some information from them we can send them a reminder email.\n\nA couple days ago I had this customer call in, pretty thick Spanish accent but still pretty understandable. His name for the purpose of this story will be Cuntstomer.\n\nMe: Hey thanks for calling The Alarm Boys Alarm Company For Alarms: Making All Your Security Based Dreams Come True Forever Amen, this is DECtape, could I get your name please?\n\nCuntstomer: WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? \"BLAH BLAH BLAH THANKS FOR CALLING BLAH BLAH\" JUST SHUT UP AND FUCKING HELP ME. MY ALARM SYSTEM WENT OFF AND I CAN'T VIEW MY CAMERAS RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT AT HOME AND I WANT SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THIS NOW!\n\nMe: Well alright sir, I can definitely understand the frustration, now before I continue could I get that name from you so I can get your account pulled up and I can look into this?\n\nCuntstomer: HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE THIS OPEN ALREADY? I'M A VERY IMPORTANT CUSTOMER DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHO I AM? MY NAME IS CUNTSTOMER!\n\nMe: Alright sir, and could I get that verbal passcode from you?\n\nCuntstomer: I JUST CALLED IN ABOUT THIS AND HAD IT CHANGED, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT!\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir but for legal reasons I am unable to discuss account details with you without that verbal passcode, I will need it to continue.\n\nCuntstomer: WHAT IS YOUR FULL NAME AND WHAT IS YOUR BADGE NUMBER? I WANT THAT SO I CAN TELL MY FRIEND THE CEO, TOM PILTERSON (it wasn't the CEO's actual name) YOU WERE BEING VERY RUDE TO ME!\n\nMe: I'm not obligated to provide you my full name sir, however my badge number is 123456.\n\nCuntstomer: WELL THEN, WHAT WAS IT 123456? DO YOU LIKE IT WHEN I CALL YOU THAT 123456? I THINK I'M GOING TO CALL YOU THAT FROM NOW ON, 123456. BECAUSE THAT'S ALL YOU ARE, A NUMBER, 123456.\n\nMe (doing my best to stifle laughter): Well alright sir, if that's what you feel most comfortable calling me you can go ahead and do that. I did however want to move focus back to the topic at hand, you had been having some trouble viewing your cameras and wanted to know what would be done about your alarm going off correct? Now, in order to provide you with that information I will need your verbal passcode, as I cannot continue without it for federal law reasons.\n\nAt this point I had his account pulled up and he did indeed have a previous case for changing the passcode just a couple hours ago. The agent had changed it to Aberdeen (not what is actually was obviously, that's a stand-in). Cunt at this point goes silent for about 50 seconds during which I assume he was glaring at his phone like a gorilla trying to prove dominance, I see people like him do that a lot in retail but it doesn't work on the phone for obvious reasons.\n\nMe (after nearly a minute of just hearing the sound of him driving over the phone): sir are you still on the line? I haven't heard anything from you in almost a minute and I wanted to make sure the call hasn't dropped.\n\nCuntstomer (after making a big exasperated sounding sigh): My verbal passcode is Aberveen. Spelled A-B-E-R-V-E-E-N.\n\nMe: Alright sir, just to check that was A-B-E-R-D with D as in delta?\n\nCuntstomer: WHAT? NO! ARE YOU DEAF AND STUPID 123456? I WAS A-B-E-R-V AS IN... VIOLET!!\n\nThis is where we had fucked up, the agent he had been speaking with before had spelled it with a D even though they're supposed to verify the spelling, if the customer hadn't spelled their verbal out for me I could have just let it slip as being the accent or the call quality being odd. But they had directly spelled it out for me and confirmed it so I had no choice but to proceed as if it was the wrong passcode.\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir but that does not appear to be correct, you can try as many times as you would like to guess the correct passcode, the only hint I am allowed to provide you with is that it is a word.\n\nCuntstomer: EXCUSE ME! WHAT DO YOU MEAN THAT ISN'T CORRECT? I JUST CHANGED IT! A-B-E-R-V-E-E-N! A-B-E-R-V-E-E-N! A-B-E-R-V-E-E-N! GET IT THROUGH YOUR THICK SKULL 123456!\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir but that does not appear to be it, if I can verify some basic information with you I could send you a reminder email with the current passcode to get you verified then we could correct the passcode to what you wish it to be.\n\nCuntstomer: I ALREADY DID THAT WITH THE LAST PERSON I TALKED TO FROM YOU IDIOTS! DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO DO YOUR JOB 123456? LET ME INNNNNNN!\n\nMe: Now sir I understand how this could be a frustrating situation, unfortunately there is not a lot I can do without that passcode, I would be happy to help you correct the situation, even apply a credit to your account to make up for the frustration but at this time I cannot provide you with information regarding your system unless you want to let me send you that email.\n\nCuntstomer: THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE! I WANT TO CANCEL MY ACCOUNT! HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT, HUH, 123456?\n\nJust so you guys know, when you sign up with us you sign a binding 5 year contract, and we really only let you out of that contract if you're about to enter military service, if the sales rep misrepresented the system, or you pay to buy out the contract, which is how much you would have paid on your ~75 a month bill for the duration of the contract plus some extra fees. The guy was like a year into the system so he wasn't going anywhere.\n\nMe: Alright sir, and like I have said I understand how it could be difficult to be unable to get into your account especially if you're worried someone is in your house, however like I have also said I am legally unable to proceed without the correct verbal. I could send you a second reminder email and we could get this taken care of, it would only take a few minutes.\n\nCuntstomer: AND HOW DO I KNOW YOU WON'T FUCK THIS UP TOO 123456? YOU'VE BEEN PRETTY DUMB SO FAR. IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET ME INTO MY SYSTEM, MY NAME IS ON THE BILL AND EVERYTHING, THEN I WANT TO TALK TO A SUPERVISOR WHO WILL!\n\nThere really isn't anything a supervisor will do for him, they need him to verify just the same as I do, if he wants to spend 10 minutes on hold to hear the same thing again that just gets him off my line and out of my life.\n\nMe (doing weakest required push-back I can): well sir, I understand where your coming from, don't get me wrong, however a supervisor is bound by the same laws as I am, and would also be required to verify you. I would be able to transfer you if you like but they would have no more power in this matter than I do.\n\nCuntstomer: I DON'T BELIEVE YOU FAGGOT. I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR SO I CAN TELL THEM ALL ABOUT HOW RUDE YOU'VE BEEN DO ME YOU STUPID HAIR LIPPED SHIT. SUPERVISOR! SUPERVISOR! SUPERVISOR! SUPERVISOR!\n\nI ended up just abandoning the second required pushback because he refused to stop chanting supervisor like the people from the escalations line were bloody fucking marry and would appear to him if he said it enough.\n\nMe: Alright sir, it sound like you want to go through with the transfer anyways, can I put you on a brief hold while I contact my supervisor for you!\n\nCuntstomer: AND WHAT WILL THEIR NAME BE 123456? AND BEFORE YOU EVEN DARE PUTTING ME ON HOLD I WANT YOUR FULL NAME TOO.\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, but like I said earlier we are not required to provide customers with our full name for security reasons, and I cannot guarantee the exact supervisor I will be able to find as they are not directly assigned (this is a lie, we hand escalated customers to a dedicated escalations line rather than to our actual supervisor).\n\nCuntstomer: FINE! BUT YOU'D BETTER GET ME A SUPERVISOR FUCKING QUICK, YOU FAT TARD, OR YOU GUYS WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR WHATEVER'S HAPPENING IN MY HOUSE!\n\nMe: Alright sir, I'll be back in just one moment.\n\nI put the customer on hold at this point, they start to say something but I just ignore it, eventually I get someone from escalations, I explain the temper tantrum they've been throwing and the escalations line person says they're ready to take the call. I go back to the call with the customer and take them off hold to let them know I'm going to transfer them now.\n\nMe: Hey Cuntstomer, you still there? Thanks for holding.\n\nCuntstomer: YES I'M STILL HERE, DID YOU MANAGE TO FIND SOMEONE OR WERE YOU TOO CONFUSED BY YOUR PHONE?\n\nMe (ignoring them at this point): Great to hear, I've got EscalationsPersonWhoIsTotallyMyRealSupervisor on the line and they can talk to you if you'd like, can I go ahead and transfer you over?\n\nCuntstomer: FUCKING FINALLY! BEFORE I GO I WANT TO ASK ONE LAST QUESTION FIRST. WHAT DISORDER TO YOU HAVE HUH?\n\nMe (through biggest retail smile): I'm sorry sir? I'm afraid I don't quite understand the question, would you care to elaborate?\n\nCuntstomer: WHAT FUCKING DISORDER? ARE YOU A DOWNY? IS IT AUTISM? ARE YOU JUST A DUMB FAGGOT? DID YOU GET KICKED IN THE HEAD? IS IT A MIX OF ALL THREE? OR ARE YOU JUST NATURALLY FUCKING STUPID? I WANT A FUCKING ANSWER BEFORE YOU TRANSFER.\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir but like I had said earlier, personally identifying information like our last names or medical information we're not supposed to give out. I can go ahead and transfer you over to that supervisor if you would like at this time, did you have any other concerns with the account or system today before I did that?\n\nCuntstomer: YOU NEVER FUCKING ANSWERED ME BUT OK, JUST TRANSFER ME ALREADY, FUCKIN SPURG.\n\nAt this point I dropped my station into aftercall and transfered the guy over and took a 3 minute sanity break, efficiency rating be damned. This was the first time a customer's rudeness caught me this off guard. Happy ending though, I pulled up the guy's account a couple days later and he had pulled the same shit on a couple of different escalations line people after the first refused to let him in without the passcode and he demanded a manger (and got transferred to a different person on the same team as is policy, obviously they didn't tell him that) eventually they just ended up banning him from the call center and told him if he needs further assistance to use the text chat or the resources on the website.\n\nTLDR: Some neanderthal calls up and manages to make a 2 minute easy to solve issue into a multi hour long call that ends with him getting banned from customer support because he couldn't keep himself from acting like a lower primate",

Nobody seems to like to speak to the contact center and most conversations start with people wanting to speak directly to their clinic or even directly to their doctor.

        "text": "Context: I used to work in the complaints department of a large, well-known bank in the UK, regarding the miss-selling of a certain insurance product. \n\nA lady calls in, and provides me with a complaints reference number. I type it into the system, and I can see that the customer listed on the complaint is a male and there is only one customer listed. This means, for security reasons, I cannot discuss the case with her.\n\nMe: \"Would I just be able to confirm that reference number again, please?\" \n\nCustomer: \"479670\"\n\n*checks that I have it correct, and I do.* \n\nMe: \"Unfortunately, it doesn't look like you are listed on the complaint so I will not be able to discuss anything with you for security reasons.\" \n\nCustomer *in the smug voice* : \"Oh, yes you can. Yes, you can and you will.\" \n\nMe: \"No, I'm sorry, but if you're not the listed customer, and they're not with you to take through security and give me permission to speak with you, I can't.\" \n\nCustomer: \"Check your records, you'll find that other advisors have spoken to me in the past about this.\" \n\nMe: \"OK, is it OK if I place you on a quick hold whilst I confirm that?\" \n\nCustomer: \"OK.\" \n\n*hold*  \n\nIt turns out, much to my horror, she was correct. They had. According to the notes left by three other advisors, the lady had a valid Letter of Authority on this case. That is something that informs us that she is free to speak on it without us having to speak to her husband at all. Normally, in that case, she would be a listed third party with her details and I'm still not entirely comfortable taking my colleagues word for it. \n\n\nSo, I run through the documents received and find this LoA, and still, it's not sitting right with me. I call my supervisor, and ask him to confirm its validity. We do have certain requirements to meet before it is deemed \"valid.\" He confirms that it is not valid, and I'm left with the delightful task of informing the customer of this. \n\n\nMe: \"Thank you for holding there, Mrs X, I do apologise for your wait. I can see that we have received a LoA for you on this case, but unfortunately, it is not actually valid. So what we will need...\" \n\nCustomer: \"Hang on, what do you mean it is not valid! I have been speaking to people about this several times!\" \n\nMe: \"I do understand that, and I do apologise for the mix-up, but I have spoken to my supervisor, and confirmed that the LoA we have received is not valid, and we will...\"\n\nCustomer: \"This is ridiculous!\" *proceeds into a rant about how ridiculous it all is, and how since she's spoken on it in the past to other people she should be able to now yadayadayada* \n\nMe: \"In order for you to become a listed third party, we will need you to send in a further LoA, with more details on it...\" *explains what details we need*\n\nCustomer: \"Can I take your FULL name?\" \n\nMe: \"I am not required to give you my full name. I can give you my staff ID, and confirm that I am the only CleverLittleViper on the team.\" \n\nCustomer: \"Well, really. Oh, I'm sure you are.\"\n*hangs up.*\n\nI understood her frustration and confusion. She was a bitch to me throughout that call-from the second that I indicated I couldn't help her. But, I did understand where she was coming from, but there was nothing I could do aside from telling her what I told her. \n\n\nSo, not only had my colleagues told her incorrect information about her LoA being valid, but they'd also breached the data protection act by discussing the complaint with her. Great. \n\nAnd I was the one left cleaning up the mess after them. That was what annoyed me. It could have been saved if someone had just done their job correctly at the start. The funny thing was, the customer was mad at me and seemed like she wanted to put in a complaint about me, but I was the only one giving her the correct information. \n\nIn some ways, I was almost giddy with joy when I found out I couldn't speak to her due to her smugness at the start. But still, it's never nice trying to clear up the mess colleagues have left behind. ",

        "text": "Strap in, folks, this is gonna be a long one. Just logged out a few minutes ago, want to document this while my eye is still twitching. \n\nBackground: I'm a \"supervisor\" for the new credit application department at a very large bank that finances the credit cards for a big-box electronics store. Basically I take calls for people wanting credit limits with lots of zeros, help calls from regular agents, and the lovely supervisor takeovers. Two heads above the bottom of the totem pole, if you will. \n\nToday around 9pm, I get an inbound call from a rep on the supervisor line (do other places abbreviate that as sup also?) She said the caller refused to give his name or any identifying information. Right away I knew it was gonna be a doozy. And he demanded that they get him to a sup within 2 minutes. He must know how we operate, our bank is notorious for the 2-3 minute hold. \n\nI say fine transfer him over. He starts asking for my name and location, so he's documenting everything. He asks about 20 questions about how our staff is run, like how many sups we have, our different locations (which he somehow knew already), how many managers are available, etc. I answer some but not all because it's not really his business. \n\nHe starts telling me about his experience at the store, how the store associate misled him and a few other things. He actually does a great job at keeping everything in chronological order. I try my best to listen, mind you my department has no real connection to the store except they call us to process an application if the register prompts them to. \n\nHe said he was trying to get ahold of the store's general manager, and he couldn't reach the store because their automated system didn't get him through to a person. Once he finally got someone, he got the manager's name and that's all, they couldn't tell him when the manager would be available. (When I worked retail we couldn't give out that information over the phone, with privacy rules and all that, but I didn't dare tell him that).\n\nWell he ended up calling the bank's customer service because he hadn't gotten his card yet, which the card takes 2 weeks and it had only been a week. And I guess he mentioned to them the experience at the store, so they directed him to call [big box electronics store]'s customer service line, 888[big box electronics store]. So he tried that, and expressed his dismay at the automated system there. Finally he was connected to a rep offshore.\n\nOur offshore reps are not employed by the bank or the store, they're contracted, for future reference. \n\nHe asked the rep if he could provide the name and availability of the store's general manager. Of course they could not. So he asked if a sup was available. According to him, he asked for a sup seven different times on the call, and the rep refused to provide one (I now see why, that's not really a valid complaint). He was also upset that the rep wouldn't tell him where they were from or their employee ID or anything. \n\nSo now he had called the bank's customer service and tried to complain there, they just put a complaint in the system but there is literally no way for anyone at the bank to send feedback or anything on the offshore reps. \n\nBefore he called and talked to me, another rep who I'm assuming was customer service, tried to get him to a sup but accidentally disconnected, so he called back. \n\nNow, he's complaining to me about all this, we're about 30 minutes in, and he has me try and call the store and see if I can get to a live person. I really didn't have to, but I did just to say I tried. Of course no answer after about 5 minutes. \n\nHe's demanding to know that if he submits a complaint about that offshore rep, who will the complaint be sent to. The honest answer is nobody because it's a different company. And he demands that I speak to MY manager and ask the question. I IMed the manager on staff and she took a while to respond, so he got frustrated and demanded that she come on the line. (No way Jose). \n\nI tell him that I will do the best I can to submit the complaint and request that it be escalated to the proper place. \n\nHere's where it gets good.\n\nHe reiterates the whole complaint, so I understand everything. (Side note: our complaints only take about 200 characters, so I heavily paraphrased). THEN. THEN he told me to repeat that back to him, so again I paraphrased but said a bit more than what I wrote down. OH NO. He was. not. having. it. How dare I sit and listen to him all this time but I can't write out word for word what he is telling me the complaint is. Again he asks for my manager and I tell him they're not available. He really wanted the complaint sent to the person in charge of the call center.\n\nI told him I am doing everything I can, and reiterate that there is not much I CAN do because it's not even the company I work for. In retrospect, I shouldn't have went as far as I did, and told him right away that it's not my problem. \n\nHe went off on a tangent and said he had to go and thanked me for nothing and hung up. (FINALLY). Literally an hour and 20 minutes.\n\n\nI realized he never gave me his name, so I looked up the account associated with his phone number so I could at least submit the complaint with a name. \n\nWe're not done yet.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after I finished that ordeal, took a long overdue 15, then I get another sup call. \n\n\"Hey azkaland it's so-and-so, I have a customer requesting a sup, he wouldn't give me his name, he wants to get a sup or at least for me to tell him the name of the sup within 2 minutes....\"\n\n\nSAY NO MORE. \n\nI tell the rep that I've already spoken to him today and if he wants a sup to call him back he can provide his name and phone number and someone will call him (i.e. not me). \n\nThis rep got off easy, only 20 mins and the guy was just filibustering, and still never gave his name. \n\nSo I sent a BOLO over email advising to watch out for a guy calling in and refusing to give his name. \n\nBTW, I looked at the complaint history, there were 5 different complaints submitted in the past 2 days, all related to this incident. I didn't even have to take the complaint since he had already called in about it. \n\nWe are allowed to say \"this call is becoming unproductive, if there isn't anything else I can help you with I will be disconnecting\" but he wouldn't stop talking long enough for me to say that. Even when he asked me a question I would start to answer then he'd say \"oh just one more thing...\" \n",

        "text": "LTL; FTP\n\nSo one of my jobs involved me working in collections for a storage company. Most of my calls involved people who had fallen far enough behind on their account that we had assessed a Lien against their storage space and they were needing to make payment arrangements with me to prevent their space from going to sale. As an interesting aside, I'd say that with roughly 80% of the spaces that get to this point, the crap the customers actually have in the space have a lesser value than what they actually owe on it. To segue that to my story, there are customer who recognize this fact, and simply let their space go to auction. The issue on the company's end is that we do not collect people's social security numbers when we set them up with a space. Because of that it makes it extremely hard to send people to 3rd party collectors and report the debt to credit bureaus, so a vast majority of the time the company simply has to eat the loss.\n\nOutside of the unicorns that pay off their owed debt even after a space is sold, the only time we ever get close to collecting anything on these previous debts is when these packrats inevitably need to store some more of their junk again. Enter Mr. Sunshine, who will henceforth be referred to as \"cust\". Cust was getting transferred over to me by a CSR on this fateful day. Cust needed to set up a storage space, and he happened to mention that he had previously had a storage space with us. The CSR does the right thing in trying to find cust's previous records, and in doing so discovers a hefty previous final bill for an old space they had previously. So the CSR makes the right call in getting cust over to me. What follows is on of my more memorable calls.\n\nMe: Hello Mr. Cust, so I understand from CSR that you were looking to try and set up a space today with us, is that correct?  \nCust: Yeah, don't know why that dumbass sent you over to me though.  \n[Internal evil grin]  \nMe: Well Mr. Cust, CSR was able to find an old space from a couple years ago that you had. It looks like based on our records that the space you had went unpaid and was sold at auction. You still have an outstanding balance of $400. Would you like to take care of that today so we can set you up with the space you need?  \nCust: What the fuck are you talking about, I don't owe you guys nothing.  \nMe: Well Mr. Cust, CSR you spoke to previously confirmed with you the address that was previously associated with the account, and based on caller id, your phone number also still matches the account info.  \nCust: Well I mean yeah I used to have a space, but I got rid of that thing ages ago, I don't owe nothing on it.  \n[We print all of the customers account notes into an electronic filing system. I had already pulled this up and read his previous notes. Que evil grin growing]  \nMe: Well actually Mr. Cust, it appears based on the notes from your previous space, you knew you still had items in the space and it was going to be up for auction on X date with a balance due at that time of $550. You told us you did not care about the items and we could sell it, but in your words 'we weren't getting another dime from you'.  \nCust: So wait a fucking minute. You sold my shit and you expect me to still pay you for it?  \nMe: Well yes sir. Even though your items sold, the amount they sold for did not cover the balance that was owed, so the final bill due is that remaining balance for the services we rendered while we continued to provide storage for your items.\n[Cust starts shuffling phone and yelling a string of curse words. On comes to the phone Mrs. Cust]  \nMe: Hello *sir* (said with a heightened amount of gusto). I understand you won't rent to my husband, which seems a bit racist to me (lol wut). I'll set the space up in my name.  \n[Evil grin reaching peak levels]  \nMe: Unfortunately Mrs. Cust, as Mr. Cust already advised us that he would in fact be the one using the space we will not be able to rent it to you either. We will need the previous balance paid on his old space first for that.  \n[Mrs. Cust starts to yell when phone starts shuffling again. Cust comes back on]\nCust: What your name again *boy*?  \nMe: It's BigEasyBobcat sir.  \nCust: Well you listen here Mr. Ice Man BigEasyBobcat (I have to mute my headset due to my laughter. I tell my cubical neighbor what I was called and he starts busting up too), you're a fucking horrible person, and you best hope I don't find you because if I do you'll disappear.  \n[Evil grin reaches ludicrous levels, extends into 3rd dimension]  \nMe: Sir if you are threatening me, I will have to disconnect this call\nCust: It ain't a threat, it's a fucking promise. Mark my words, you're the kind of fucker that winds up being found dead in a dumpster.\n[Brief pause because I cannot believe what I just heard]  \nMe: I'm sorry you feel that way sir, you are in fact entitled to your opinion of my person. Would you like to pay anything towards your final bill today?  \nCust: And they won't know either. The police. I'll make sure nobody knows. You'll just be there one day and gone the next. And when the garbage man comes, that's when you'll be found.  \nMe: Well sir that's a very interesting story. If you would like to come to our main office to discuss this issue with my manager we are located at X address (the cust lived in a completely different state several hundred miles away). As it is, due to your continued threats and language I will be sending your account info to my manager with the suggestion of forwarding it to credit bureaus. At this point I am no longer able to assist you.  \nCust: Fuck you bitch, you better watch your back. **click**\n\nI immediately sent a message out to the entire team that a customer with X phone number would likely try calling back to rent a space, but we are under NO circumstances to rent to them. Unfortunately our CSRs got bonuses for renting spaces. So Mrs. Cust calls back and gets dumb-fuck-stupid-cunt-bitch (so many stories about her racist shenanigans) CSR who ignored my message and proceeded to rent a space to them. Jokes on them though, I told my manager, and they denied the cust's rental agreement and told them they had to move out after their first month was up, and if they didn't we were going to file eviction proceedings against them.\n\nTL;DR: Irate customer wants to make me a full grown prom dumpster baby, in a slightly more murder-y fashion. Hopefully he at least wears the prom dress while doing it.",

Why the fuck don't you know?\n\nI then explain that I can't see any information on her account relating to a recent order and that the social media teams we have use different methods to contact customers so I can't see that. Throughout me explaining this she interrupts me, then tells me off for continuing to speak through her interruptions (See that noise? That's me speaking. Fucking stop speaking when you hear that) as we're supposed to if a customer isn't listening to policy.\n\nShe then explains her issue which is one that can get resolved within a few weeks, once she's returned the goods back to us. During me explain the processes, she interrupts, admonisishes me for interrupting her interruptions, insults me, tells me the policy is stupid/wrong.\n\nShe basically comes at me that she's unable to return the goods because she's disabled. We offer more than a dozen ways to return goods including collection from your home/dropping off at local stores. She was just unwilling to consider any of the options I offered.  She continues shouting, interrupting and being personal, demanding to speak to someone more senior. I tell her that I'm the most senior person that she'll speak to about it so she lays into me and I was mostly shocked so I didn't really get upset or angry.\n\nMy manager sits across from me throughout this call and listens in, through her claims that I'm sarcastic and rude.\n\nEventually I point out that we've come to a cross roads.\n\nM - For the thing you want, you need to return the goods. If you're unable or unwilling, there's nothing I can do to get that for you.\n\nL - Unwilling? How fucking dare how. I'm disabled!  I'm gonna make sure you lose your job!\n\nShe then disconnects the line.\n\nI went over to my manager and spoke to him. He says I wasn't inappropriate or sarcastic as she was claiming so I feel better. \n\nI decided to look her up on google afterwards and find she's been fined for running fake charity scams, claiming she's disabled when she's not. Classy lady, am I right?\n\n",

        "text": "So, I'll be the first to say it, I hate collectors. It's a job that's entirely about parting you from your money, and honestly, some people just don't give a fuck about anything but taking your money. However, sometimes you have someone like me who will bend over backwards for you if my bullshit detector doesn't go off (for the record, I am a hardass when it comes to people who consistently try to abuse our system, and will get every last fucking cent I can from the people who try to avoid their bills). \n\nYesterday, whilst working my 10 hour shift (making up my hours), I get a call from a woman who was having her life fall down around her. She's sobbing because her husband just up and left her with a 789.00 bill (a few months past due) from us and quite a few other bills. She works part time. She moved to X city in another state to be with him. I've heard a lot of fake crying on the phone. Usually clears up when we say we can set up their payments and they need to be heard clearly, or when I place them on hold so I can do the math for the arrangements. I say we'll get it taken care of and she is still bawling. \n\nSo, I start working the system to give her every last second I can to ensure her service won't be cut off. Sure enough, I can't get her entire bill in my time frame. I don't tell her this, as she's still loudly crying and I'm not going to make it worse. So I figure, best I can do is set her up on a smaller time scale for the minimum amount I can do and get a dispute going for the remainder. We're technically not supposed to do this when they are technically liable for the bill, but seriously, she's getting reamed by life and I'd hate to get fucked over on any of my services because of some serious bullshit. \n\nSo I tell her that, and she, still sobbing, blubbers out, \"there's no way you'd do that for me\". Of motherfucking course I will. She's gonna need our services to get a lawyer and bleed the asshole who left a woman who MOVED FUCKING STATES FOR HIS ASS, for every asset she could find. So as I'm setting it all up, making the notes, and putting the dispute on the account, she's trying to say I don't have to go through this trouble, she can't believe [company] would do this for her, and other things I had trouble making out because, well, people who've been sobbing for awhile just don't sound very clear.\n\nSo I get it all set up, nice and pretty, letting my sup know she needed to approve this one quickly. \n\nThen I told my hippy coworker to send good vibes her way, and then explained to an elderly German man how he had been given bad information and had to pay manually till he set up automatic payments. So don't think to poorly about collectors, We're not all bastard covered bastards with bastard filling.",

My boss is actually at a conference for most of next week and won't return to the office until my last day of work. I so wanted to tell AC that, but I figured it's better for me to get the last laugh as she wastes her time and my boss does absolutely nothing about this \"complaint.\" If the AC even remembers to call back! \n\nI talked to a different supervisor later, and she said she's also been accused of being mean and nasty when she tells customers information they don't want to hear. \n\nOh and AC STILL didn't like my answer and proceeded to call the company she did purchase from to call us and argue on her behalf. I gave the third party the same answer and they still tried to claim we were responsible for updating THEIR website. Go figure. ",

        "text": "Kind of long, I do most sincerely apologize.\n\nSo I work for a large bank in the fraud department. One day I got a call from a customer who wanted to verify some ATM withdrawals so he could get cash out.\n\nMe=Me, Caller=CH\n\nMe: Alright sir so I understand you were trying to get some money out at the ATM and you were declined is that right?\n\nCH: Ya I have plenty of money in my account so why am I getting declined?\n\nMe: Let me take a look into that for you sir, can I place you on a brief hold?\n\nCH: Sure.\n\nSo I look at the transaction history and this 19 year old kid has had about $200 dollars in his account at most for as long as he has had an account. All of the sudden on this day he has made about 5 ATM check deposits ranging from $500 to $1800 and he is now attempting to take most of that money out not 5 minutes later. So I go into our program which lets us see the actual checks being deposited. Lo and behold, CH has been depositing blank checks with only the amount filled in, no signature, no written out amounts, just the digits in the amount box filled out. \n\nI get back on the phone.\n\nMe: Alright sir, so I see no blocks on the account, however, since you just made some deposits at the ATM where a teller couldn't see the checks we're going to have to wait for those checks to clear before you can withdraw those funds.\n\nVERY long pause\n\nCH:Ok, so, like, those checks will clear can you just let me take out like a couple hundred dollars? I have some bills to pay today. \n\nMe: No, unfortunately you will just have to wait. If you needed the money now you should have deposited them in the bank.\n\nCH: But its really important that I get that money now, can you make an exception?\n\nMe: I apologize sir, but we need to make sure those checks are valid before we can release the funds. People deposit fake checks all the time. I'm not saying that's what you did but its the bank's policy to verify those checks before the funds can be withdrawn.\n\nCH: So, what happens to those people that deposit fake checks?\n\nMe: Well they typically get their accounts closed, reported to other banks, and are never allowed to open an account with us after that. But if those checks are legit you don't need to worry about that, because they were good checks right sir?\n\nClick.\n\nI checked a couple of days later and of course the kid's account is closed. \n\nPro tip: Just because you can, don't think your bank won't figure out you're depositing fake checks. At least take the time to fill out all of the fields.",

I'll call them G and myself M.\n\nM: Hello, my name is lawadnorder, calling from [company], may I speak with G?\n\nG: Speaking.\n\nM: Alright, so the reason I called is because you have a balance of [X] and [X] of it is past due, how would you like to take care of that today?\n\nG gets irate because I mentioned the balance for next month's bill (it's required), and says \n\nG: Why would I pay next month in advance? Paying in advance is stupid! Do you do that?\n\nSo, I take my financial advice from my mom. She retired 15 years early, and will never have to worry about bills ever again. She ALWAYS tells me to pay in advance when I can, and her advice has helped me a lot when I was unemployed and had no way to pay bills. I was able to sleep easy knowing my utilities, HOA, and internet wouldn't be shut off due to me putting money in to each thing each paycheck. So I reply:\n\nM: Yessir I do, it ensures that in the event of an emergency, that I don't have to worry about my services being interrupted. \n\nThis motherfucker laughs. Like he's the smartest person ever because he pays month to month, and if ever there's an emergency, he'll have to juggle bills (I've talked to a LOT of these people, it's not fun). \n\nG: you're just giving them your money to play with! \n\nM: Alright sir, you're entitled to your opinion. So we'll set up the arrangement to pay on X day for x amount. \n\nG: Sounds good to me. \n\nNow, I dunno about y'all, but when you're in the collections process, I don't think you have any reason to be trash talking other people's financial decisions.

Fraud really doesn't like getting calls with no info, so I ask for something to pull her account up. \n\nCaller: oh, I'm not a customer. Someone deposited one of my late husbands cheques through one of your banks atm's. His employer told me they can't do anything and I have to contact you. \n\nMe: If you're not a (thisbank) customer, we have no way to initiate a claim like that. The RCMP can subpoena the information about the deposit if you believe it to be true identity or mail theft, or the cheque issuers bank can submit a fraud claim and we will respond appropriately. \n\nHer: Let me talk to fraud, they'll know what to do, I NEED you to talk to (chequeissuersbank) for me and you NEED to start the claim from your end. \n\n*Yes, the word \"need\" was emphasized every time.*\n\nMe: Fraud generally does not deal with non-customers, but I will talk to them on - (at this point she starts talking over me about her NEED to talk to them)\n\nMe: Ma'am, as I said, I *will* call down to them on your behalf to see if there is anything they can do (hit hold before she can say anything else)\n\nTalk to a fraud specialist, who even very kindly talked to a senior fraud analyst to verify - no, we can't initiate the claim, and legally we can't release the depositor's info without a specific type of investigation request from the cheque issuers bank. So I go back to the lady\n\nMe: Thank you for holding, I confirmed with both a general and senior level fraud specialist that your late husband's employer, as the cheque issuer, needs to have their bank start a specific claim called a (claimtype). For privacy reasons we cannot cold call that bank based on a request from a member of the general public to investigate. \n\nHer: They said I had to call (thisbank) to start the claim. I NEED you to do it. \n\nMe: We can only start claims for our own customers who have been defrauded, to assist in this type of situation, we must have (chequeissuersbank) send a request that we can respond to.\n\nHer: No, no, I NEED your fraud department to call (chequeissuersbank)\n\nMe: Ma'am, I know this is really frustrating for you, but *legally* we cannot be the ones to proactively give out our customers information we must have a (claimtype) come through from (chequeissuersbank). \n\nHer: But they said I had to call *your* fraud department. I NEED you to call them for me! Let me talk to your fraud department! \n\nAt that point my shift was officially over, so I gave up arguing, called fraud back, gave the sitch to the analyst, apologized profusely and wished him luck that she would believe it if it came from him.

In this case a Chinese lady in her early 30's.\n\n\nOccasionally, on one of these calls; an absolute gem pops up, when a customer realises they messed up, and eventually works out how bad. This is one of those such calls.\n\nSC = stupid customer.\n\n\nM = Me\n\n\n&gt; M: Good afternoon International dept, IntLogistic speaking; how can i help?\n\n\n&gt; SC: Im calling about my package i sent to [country]!'\n\n\n*I ask her to give me the tracking number, which she does. I ask her to hold for a moment and shove the number into the tracking site and it stops at [country] customs.*\n\n\n*I punch the number into my emails and find what i'm looking for. An email stating the parcel had been seized by destination customs, and advising if the recipient wanted more information, they could call customs directly.*\n\n\n*At this point it dawns on me. I already told her this before...*\n\n\n&gt; M: Uhmm hello? \n\n\n&gt; SC: Yes?\n\n\n&gt; M: My name is IntLogistic; i'm relatively sure we had a 30 minute conversation about this shipment yesterday? Is that right?\n\n\n&gt; SC: Yes but its not fair. Why have you stolen my parcel?\n\n\n&gt; M: I'm sorry Mrs SC, Nobody has stolen your parcel. Customs in destination have seized the shipment. \n\n\n&gt; SC: When will i get it back?\n\n\n&gt; M: You wont.\n\n\n&gt; SC: Ok so it is lost? how so i claim for it?\n\n\n&gt; M: You can't claim for it, the parcel is not lost, it has been seized by the government body that regulates import and export of goods into the destination country. We do not have jurisdiction over customs in destination, or even here domestically. We cannot force them to send your parcel back to you.\n\n\n&gt; SC: But why did they do that?\n\n\n*I don't know the answer to this, customs won't tell the sender any information, and will only deal with the recipient. As our customer is the sender, and we effectively send it on their behalf, we get no imformation either. This means i have to take my experience and guess to help the customer. This often involves asking very tentative questions that need to be amswered honestly.*\n\n*I look at the invoice documentation, Description: Bag. Qty: 6, Total Value: 300 USD.*\n\n\n*The customer isn't on hold at this point, but neither of us are speaking.*\n\n\n&gt; M: Right, Okay. What kind of bags were they?\n\n\n&gt; SC: They are prada bags, mostly leather!\n\n\n*I know nothing about bags, but i know anything Prada means expensive*\n\n\n&gt; M: Were they from a reputable dealer?\n\n\n*suspecting fakes*\n\n\n&gt; SC: from an outlet in London?\n\n\n*then it hits me like a smack in the face.*\n\n\n&gt; M: How much did you pay for those bags?\n\n\n&gt; SC: like 350-450 USD?\n\n\n&gt; M: For all of them?\n\n\n*Still suspecting fakes.*\n\n\n&gt; SC: No, each!\n\n\n*Oh God... this is exactly what i thought when i looked at the invoice she filled out... 6 'Bags' 300 USD? A bit vague, and with express clearance, customs only see the invoice, they never see the parcel itself. No wonder customs seized it!*\n\n\n&gt; M: So, i'm pretty sure i figured out what the problem is... you bought $2400 worth of designer hand bags and put them in a box, then wrote $300 on the box?\n\n\n&gt; SC: Yes i am sending them for my friend and she said she did not want to pay the tax when i sent them last time.\n\n\n&gt; M: Wait, you sent these before?\n\n\n&gt; SC: Yes, but they want $1300 customs money, so we returned and send again.\n\n\n&gt; M: And this time as $300 instead of $2400 on the invoice?\n\n\n&gt; SC: Yes exactly!\n\n\n&gt; M: That is why customs have seized your bags.\n\n\n&gt; SC: But what did i do wrong?\n\n\n&gt; M: Well, mis-declaring the contents is fraud, and in this case tax evasion... \n\n\n&gt; SC: I'm sorry! I didnt know it was so bad!\n\n\n&gt; M: Its not me that you need to apologize to really...\n\n\n&gt; SC: Okay, can you tell them I'm sorry?\n\n\n&gt; M: You would like me to call a [country] government body, customs; and tell them you're sorry for commiting fraud and tax evasion?\n\n\n&gt; SC: Yes, thank you. Can i have my package back now?\n\n\n&gt; Me: No, I'm sorry but as I've expla...\n\n*phone goes dead*\n\n\nThis sort of thing happens a lot...\n\n\n\nEdit: sp/grammar",

        "text": "Patient calls in and the \"whisper\" tells me that he's calling for one of our more interesting psych clinics. Me will be me and CP will be crazy pants. \n\nMe: thank you for calling medical facility. This is UmbraCelestia. How can I help you?\n\nCP: Yeah I want to reschedule my appointment on 7/28/16\n\nMe: (thinking I misheard and he meant 2017) okay let me take a look at your chart.  \n(Verifies HIPAA) \n\nMe: Sir I don't see that you have any appointments right now. \n\nCP: Of course I have an appointment! It's on 7/28! \n\nMe: (on a hunch I check the past appointments and see an appointment from the same date but last year and sees that it was cancelled) Sir are you referring to an appointment from 2016? I see an appointment on 7/28 last year but it was cancelled. \n\nCP: I didn't cancel that! Get it back!\n\nMe: Sir I can't get it back. This date already passed. This was last year. \n\nCP: No! Reschedule my appointment! Can you do that or not? (Starts making humming/clicking noises and mumbling to himself) \n\nMe: No sir, I can't reschedule an appointment that was supposed to take place last year. I can send a message to the doctor for clarification if you'd like. \n\nCP: if you do that, when I hear from the doctor can I call back then to reschedule my appointment?\n\nMe: sir you don't have an appointment to reschedule. \n\nCP: Yes or no, can you reschedule it after I talk to my doctor?\n\nMe: ... sure. \n\nCP: Okay I'll wait on a call from the doctor then. Goodbye. \n\n-----\n\nI wish I could listen to that call when the clinic staff calls him back to tell him he doesn't have an appointment and so they can't reschedule an appointment that was cancelled last year. \n\n",

        "text": "So figure I should start posting some stuff. Recently landed a call center job at a major credit bureau. Found out not as shady as people think they are, at least not my side of it (memberships). This call came in on a slow day so I was feeling good.\n\nMe- Some poor soul giving advice\nAD- Angry dude who wanted no help.\n\nMe-Hello thank you for calling _____, my name is Echosniper, how can I help you today?\n\nAD- Yes I use your service, and I'm a victim of fraud, I just applied for a Macy's card, and when I looked at my alert, there's a notice for three inquires, when I should just have one.\n\nPretty simple fix, the three bureaus each give an alert if the customer has three bureau monitoring.\n\nMe- Alright sir I can take a look for you, may I get your social security number or membership id so I may pull up your account?\n\nAD- SSN is 111-11-1111\n\nLook into his account, he has 3B monitoring and the alerts show it comes from all three bureaus, all for one Macy's card.\n\nMe- Alright sir, so looking into this matter it seems like because you have three bureau monitoring, or gave you an alert for each different bureau, and not just one. That's why there's three alerts for one card.\n\nAD- No no no no you're not listening to me, can you fucking listen?\n\nWhoa what?\n\nMe- I'm sorry sir?\n\nAD- You're rattling off some basic bullshit they tell you too, this is fraudulent and I want those other two removed from my report!\n\nOk what the fuck? I give you the answer and you deny the answer, and think you know better? Why call customer care in the first place then?\n\nMe- Sir I understand this can seem stressful, but if you go into your account and check the alerts it'll sa-\n\nAD- Do you like your job?\n\nMe- Pardon sir?\n\nAD- Do. You. Like. Your. Job?\n\nMe- Uh, yes I do. Why do you ask sir?\n\nAD- Because if you don't fix this problem, I'm going to make sure you don't have that job anymore. I'm recording this call, I'll send an email to your boss, I'll include this conversation, and it'll show how rude and stupid you are being.\n\nThis went on for another couple of minutes. Ranging from him insulting me, to me explaining why some things cost money, (We don't get the other two credit reports for free, if we need to buy them, so do you!)\n\nAD- Listen I don't want to fucking talk with a low level dumbass right now, I want to speak with someone who knows what they are doing, *click*\n\nNo supervisor, no escalation, didn't even deactivate his account. Well alright then. Considering this is like my 2nd month in to call center jobs ever, think I'm going to enjoy it here.",

        "text": " \n\nMe:  \"Thank you for calling Customer Support for Retailer, how may I help you?\"\n\nCustomer:  \"A few years ago I was at your place, there was a woman in charge.  I want to speak with her.\"\n\nWhich woman? In what department?  Which division?  Which **building**? In my department of 100 people, there 6 women \"in charge\".  There are countless other women in charge elsewhere in the company.  Whatever.\n\nM:  \"I can certainly see what I can do, may I have your name so that I can better assist you?\"\n\nC:  \"You don't need that, just get me the woman in charge.\"\n\nM:  \"Okay, do you have a name for the person you are looking to speak with?\"\n\nC: *groans* \"How do you not know the person in charge of your place?\"\n\nLady, I'm the lowest person on a five tier totem pole, I'm only required to know the name's of people two tiers above me and only by luck do I know one person in the tier above that.\n\nM:  \"I apologize ma'am, but there has been some reshuffling in management positions over the past few years and I have not yet worked here long enough to become familiar enough with all the associates in management positions.  If you tell me what the issue is, I can certainly determine which of the managers would be best able to assist you.\"\n\nC: *murmur* useless shit.\n\nM:  \"My apologies ma'am, I think you faded out for a moment, could you please repeat that so that I can assist you?\"\n\nC: \"Why should I have repeat the same story a dozen times, I want speak to with the woman in charge.\"\n\nM:  \"One moment while I get someone.\"\n\nC:  \"Don't get me some-\" I put her on hold, and called my direct supervisor.  While it is doubtful that she would be able to do anything, I did not have the number of anyone higher since that is not something I supposed to know to do my job.\n\nDS:  \"What's up?\"\n\nM:  \"I have a Customer that wants to speak with the female *in charge* of the place.\"\n\nDS:  \"What?\"\n\nM:  \"The customer wants to speak with the female *in charge* of the place\"\n\nDS: \"I got that part, but what does that mean?\"\n\nM:  \"I don't know, she says I don't need to know her name nor why she's calling, and she has given nothing useful to figure out what the best course of action is to help.\"\n\nDS: *sighs* \"I'm not taking this call, I have things I need to do that are more important than a problem customer who won't tell us anything.\"\n\nM:  \"I figured as much, do you have the email of the department head, I'll just tell the customer that the department head's on vacation and send an email with the customer's information to have the department head contact her later.\"\n\nDS:  \"Funny story, Matt is actually on vacation.  He'll be back next week.\"  \n\nProceeds to give me Matt's email address.  I go back to the customer.\n\nM:  \"Thank you for patiently holding, I apologize for the wait.  Unfortunately the department head, Matt, is currently on vacation and will not be back until next week.  I can send an email to Matt asking  him to call you back to assist with this issue when they get back if you would like.\"\n\nC:  \"No, I would not like that.  Your technical department screws up my computer, causing me to lose 10 years of files relating to my corporations business deals, and you want me to wait another week.  No, that's not acceptable.  I have 5 major business deals that I have been working on for the past 7 years that I am supposed wrapping up tomorrow, that I need to refer to information from 4 years ago for 3 of them that I don't know and I don't have the paperwork to get these all deals accomplished.  If the department head is not in, then get me their boss.\"\n\n\nOkay, there are a number of things wrong with what she just told me. \n \nOne:  Why doesn't her company, or god forbid, she have backups of this **important** paperwork.\n\nTwo:  If these deals are so important, why don't you have backups.\n\nThree:  For god's sake, Backups!!!\n\n\nMy personal introspection about backups aside, the problem she's having won't be resolved by the department head's superior, and that's because Matt's superior would be the division head, and all he does in crunch numbers to make sure that the departments below him hit their number targets.  He knows literally nothing about fixing computers.  If the customer speaks to him, she'll get nothing but platitudes about how sorry he is and *maybe* offer to refund what she paid when she brought her computer to us for repair.  That's best case scenario, worst case is he'll forward her the paperwork she signed that stated that she understood that she could lose some or all data during our work on her computer and thus we could not be held responsible for data loss if she refused to get her data backed up before having us work on it.  The person above him? Another number cruncher who handles the regional numbers, and above that is the vice president before finally getting to the company president.  None of whom were hired for their computer technical know-how.\n\n\nThe people best able to assist her would be someone on our department's customer relations team; they're the people above the supervisors' of direct supervisors, but below the department head.  More importantly, they have a lot of technical know-how between the team members.\n\nM:  \"I apologize ma'am, but unfortunately Matt's superior would not be able to assist with this issue as he does no have technical know-how on computers.  If you need to speak to someone higher up who can assist you with this issue who has authority, you will want to speak with the Department customer relations team.\"\n\nC:  \"Absolutely not, I spoke with them earlier and they were terrible.  They refused to help me and they act like they are always right and the customer is wrong.  I don't want to speak with them.  Get me Matt's superior.\"\n\nWell considering you and your company apparently lack the foresight and capability to create regular backups of your important documents, I can see why they would think you're always wrong.\n\nM:  \"I can understand your desire to speak with Matt's superior, since typically going the next level up in authority will usually get better results; but unfortunately Matt's superior would not be able assist with this issue because he does not have the know-how.  He's a number cruncher to make sure we hit certain goals.\"\n\nC:  \"You're telling me that Matt's superior would not be able to help me?\"\n\nM:  \"That is correct.\"\n\nC:  \"Bullshit.  Get me Matt's superior.\"\n\nM:  \"Ma'am, I as I informed you before - \"\n\nC:  \"Get me Matt's superior.  Get me Matt's superior.  Get me Matt's superior.\"\n\nShe goes on like a broken record like this, refusing to let me get a word in edgewise; as if she says it enough Matt's superior will just appear on the line like some number-crunching Beetlejuice.  It's at this point in time that I get an IM from the supervisor of my supervisor.\n\nSDS:  'Hey, I've been listening to your conversation.  Transfer her over Emily in the department customer relations team.  *Don't tell the customer that*'\n\nI briefly mute the customer's side of the conversation so that I finally have blissful silence.\n\nM:  \"Ma'am, unfortunately I don't have a way to transfer you to Matt's superior, but I can absolutely transfer you over to Emily; she's the person in charge when Matt is not around.\"\n\nI unmute the customer.\n\nC:  \"And this Emily can help me?\"\n\nM:  \"She would be the best person to assist you when Matt is not around.\"\n\nC:  \"Alright, and what is your name?\"\n\nOh boy.\n\nM:  \"Psi.\"\n\nC:  \"And your last name.\"\n\nM:  \"Unfortunately, for security reasons we are not allowed to give out last names.  My employee number is 1234\"\n\nC:  *Grunts* \"And this is the same for Emily.\"  \n\nM:  \"That is correct.\"\n\nC:  \"Fine.  Transfer me over, but if Emily's not able to help me, I **will** see you fired.\"\n\nI then transfer over to Emily's line.  I know it might seem silly, but I really want to know what was done to *resolve* this customers problem.",
