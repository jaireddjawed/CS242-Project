        "text": "Burial rites are done for bringing conclusion to friends and family, to help processing grief, and for sending souls back into hyperspace where they came from.\n\nThe cyborg dichotomy is a common theme in transhumanist thought, usually concluded with whole brain emulation. However, just because you chop off a part of yourself doesn't mean that the part disappears. The brain is part of a network of neurons which spans the entire body.\n\nFurther, losing a limb is probably traumatic. Should not the person who has this happen to them be allowed to grief? After all, losing a close one is often described as feeling like one lost a limb.",

        "text": "Here's my reasoning why people who are transhumanist should be pro-choice when it comes to suicide and vice versa.  \nI'm sure transhumanist are also susceptible to myths revolving around suicide and stigma and platitudes revolving around it, but let's ignore that for the moment. One of the best and highest ideals of humanity is freedom, in the current state we are ruled by our genes and body, there's so little we can do, we are destined to conform to biology and live 70,80 years, or how much our genetics and environmental influences 'decide', this isn't freedom at all, we don't have a choice in say how we want to live and how long we want to live. Transhumanism transcends these limitations and gives us a choice.  \nSame with being pro-choice with suicide, to not conform to biology and being able to choose to opt-out, why should I live my age predisposed by my genetics and then die? Why can't I decide when to opt-out?  \nI guess the stigma comes from people thinking that suicide is never rational or suicide is always result of mental illness or impulsive, which I would strongly disagree with, stating such generalizing statements is a delusional and arrogant thing to do, and probably stems from one's own bias by prefering existence thus projecting their values onto another entity, there are people who prefer non-existence and have completely sound and reasoned argument for it, why they prefer that over existing.  \nSo to conclude this, we should have safe means not only to transcend this biological shell, but also to have safe means to opt out, at the end of the day, it's about choice, and no one should be stripped of their freedom be it by culture, government or biology.",

        "text": "Although we humans have evolved to ascended above the animal world, our vestigial and tribalist instincts still remain a dominant force hiding behind the façade of abstract and arbitrary creations. Such is the intricate nature of our internal mechanism. A constant struggle between instinct and reason. Our innate desires and reaction often overpower our facility to reason. There is a stark contrast between the two faculties of mind, one of emotion and one of rational thought. Emotion has a basis on neurochemicals while rationality has a basis in somatotopic organization. Modern society is surprisingly susceptible to this. Social organization and instinctual reactions have not evolved biologically enough to suit modernity. Tribalist remnants remain deeply ingrained within out brain. The purpose of religion is to create a paradigm which distinguish human from animal. The absence of religion led to degeneracy for humans to animals. This is ubiquitous in many aspects within the current society. The congregation of people of politics is no different than tribes gathering together. Most likely, people associate with a certain ideology NOT out of rational decision, but rather, the social group they are contained within. We are hypersocialized in middle school and high school, where teenagers naturally align to their tribal \"clique\". Those who fail to conform to their tribe are ostracized and excluded. Furthermore, the mating paradigm of parties is no different than lek mating that exist in some species. Alcohol subdues the rational mind such that humans degredate to a level no different than animals. Our ability to reason is what differentiates our species. High school also sifts out strata of genetic quality and reproductive fitness. This manifests in the three \"powers\" - social, physical and mental, which women select based on. This division manifests as the \"socs, jocks, nerds\" trifecta of clique. Social power utilizes networking and hierarchical power to ensure security to protect for the young.  Physical power utilizes strength, subconscious intimidation and defensive ability to protect the young. Mental power utilizes wit, outmaneuvering and financial potential to protect for the young. Thus a woman is most attracted to a man who is well connected, with muscles, and has a good sense of humor. This selection mechanism is archaic and do not reflect the fitness levels to the modern society. Into adulthood social stratification again sifts us into stacks of tribes, depending largely upon the career. We are then hypersocialized into political conformity through office \"atmosphere\", trade unions, associations and the like. Body language is another vestige of tribalism. Territoriality and mostly instinctual gesturing plays a role in asserting our power and conduct on others. The \"gut feeling\" results from an incongruity between rationality and emotions. We can sense insincerity through when body language contradicts verbal language. It is not easy to deceive as body gestures are instinctual. Perhaps the most pervasive issue is the amity-enmity complex between \"invisible tribes\". Fashion, speech, culture, ethnicity and conduct masks tribal distinction. We then perceive a \"us and them\" dichotomy, which prevents cooperation between ingroups and outgroups. All major conflicts arise from the tribalist distinction between groups of people. Since we are in constant competition for resources, mates and shelter, we have an innate distrust and enmity of those outside the whims of our tribe. \n\nIn order to construct a peaceful society the first priority should be to genetically eliminate traces of tribalism and its roots deeply residing in the subconscious mind. If we cannot eliminate this humanity likely will self-disintegrate into chaos. The escalation of military arises from the dominant-submissive power struggle between states. We are in economic competition for the wrong reasons. It should be to further human progress rather than selfish pursuit and competition on the hedonistic treadmill. Our endless desire for more will ultimately strip the Earth of its resources and create an unprecedented catastrophe. If we have learned anything from history, is that wars HAVE AND ALWAYS WILL utilize the best technology and expose the worst from humanity. It is in our best interest to modify the posthuman freed from vestigial desires such that we can unify and work together to contribute to the collective good.",
