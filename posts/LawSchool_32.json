I think I can still pass the course, but I am hoping to transfer from my law school in Ontario to BC, specifically UVic for my 2L. I am doing well in my other courses so far, but obviously you need to have good grades to transfer. Do you think this will heavily impact my chances of transferring? I",

She is originally from Taulihawa and has migrated to Kathmandu after both her parents passed away during a car accident. She lives in an apartment complex in Thamel owned by Ms. Lajja.\n\nThe apartment complex is three floors. The ground floor has a stationary shop which is run by Ms. Lajja, first floor is a two-bedroom apartment which is given in rent, and the top floor is the private residence of Ms. Lajja.\n\nMs. Satakshi and Ms. Lajja entered into a contract for 2 years with a monthly rent of Rs. 20000/- however, the contract was not in written form. These terms were orally mentioned during their first meeting, where Ms. Lajja also specified that by staying in the house, Satakshi should “study well, and do anything which helps her excel academically” and that the landlady will “come to inspect the apartment from time to time by providing her prior notice.”\n\nAs Ms. Satakshi was performing well in school, she got selected for a four-month study abroad program with scholarship. She wanted to sub-lease the apartment for the four months, so she leased it to her cousin Ms. Appu who had just completed her law degree from KUSOL. She asked Ms. Appu to pay the full rent every month to Ms. Lajja.\n\nMs. Lajja was travelling abroad to meet her cousins, therefore her phone was not reachable. As Ms.\n\nSatakshi was unable to contact her, Ms. Satakshi dropped Ms. Lajja an email stating the following: “Dear Ms. Lajja, I am leaving for a study abroad program for four months and I have sub-leased the premises to my cousin Ms. Appu for the time being. She will be shifting to the apartment in another 14 days and willbe paying the rent on my behalf.”\n\nThree months later, Ms. Lajja came back to Kathmandu. She finally opened her email and saw themessage. She had also noticed that she had not got the monthly rent amount for the past three months.\n\nMs. Lajja tried contacting Ms. Satakshi whose Nepali mobile phone was switched off. She dropped her an email stating the following: “I am evicting you tomorrow.”\n\nNext day, Ms. Lajja opens the door to the 1st floor apartment, asks Appu to pack her things immediately and leave. She clears out the apartment and pastes a “To-Let” sign outside the building.\n\nMs. Appu gets in touch with Ms. Satakshi and tells her the entire situation. Ms. Satakshi is shocked at the situation and decides to proceed legally.\n\nMs. Satakshi sues Ms. Lajja for breach of contract.",

But the better question, in my opinion, is, *“Why is this the policy?”*\n\nThis law school in the Philippines imposed a policy that UNVACCINATED students cannot enroll. Consequently, I, being in love with social justice (Yup! I was called Ms. Human Rights), expressed my displeasure to one of their decision-makers about how unfair and unjust the policy is (through a formal letter, of course), but I received no response. The next thing I know, I am already being accused of violating the student code of conduct.\n\nWhat breaks my heart is not so much the possibility of failing to achieve my goal of becoming a lawyer as it is the fact that injustice can occur literally anywhere, even in places you would think would teach you what justice is. THIS FACT IS SO HARD TO SWALLOW.\n\nIf this experience has taught me anything, it is to always put my principles ahead of my dreams.\n\nFolks, let us strive to be better than these organizations/ corporations that deny people social justice, human rights, and respect.

Before today, I applied to about 10 of those and have only gotten a screener for one, and I felt like I networked like heck to get to that point, but I didn't leave the screener feeling great about it. I haven't heard back from any of the others. I applied to the last two on my list today.\n\nUp until today I applied to 5 PI positions and the AG's office for my state, but most of my future efforts will be looking into PI, or doing OCI at my school (plus sitting to a couple more gov positions). So far I've been rejected from 2 PI internships, with one saying the reason is that they give preference to 2Ls, and the other one never got my grades. Starting February if I haven't found anything I'm going to start calling clerks to apply for judicial internships, and if that doesn't work, I guess I'll start calling local firms. I'm waiting until February because my plan was to do a judicial externship next year, but plans change, I guess\n\nI'm at a T-20 with grades that I feel like should warrant getting some bites, but I just sent grades out last week. I'm just feeling like maybe I messed up with my other materials? My career services looked at my cover letter and resume, but maybe I should rework them? It's probably too soon to feel helpless but after two rejections so shortly after my high of getting my grades I'm feeling very down. \n\nIdk what I'm looking for, but if you have advice or encouragement, I'd welcome either.",

        "text": "Since spring OCI is coming upon us, I figured a little primer might be helpful for you all. I’ve worked and interned for about a half dozen state and local agencies over the past decade. Again, this is only for state and local agencies. I can’t answer any questions about federal agencies, as I’ve never worked at any.\n\n1) Grades still matter*\n\nWhile it’s true that graded and school rank matter less for state and local agencies, they still matter—less for internships, but more for actual jobs. For 1L and 2L summers and school year externships, grades and rank matter in relation to the number of spots available. In good economic years, it is generally easier to get a government internship because more people go to firms. In bad economic years, it can be quite competitive—one year my office saw an extreme uptick in top 14 applicants. \n\nThe exception to the emphasis on grades is criminal law. These agencies (both prosecution and defense) will frequently prefer candidates who have a demonstrated interest in criminal law over someone with better grades but no interest. \n\nThe same metrics apply for attorney jobs. Civil jobs may still have an emphasis on grades—particularly for more prestigious positions like honors programs and jobs with the state solicitor general’s office. Criminal positions will look for candidates with demonstrated interest and experience—e.g. prior internships and courtroom experience. As an example, my previous criminal law agency frequently favored candidates from non-elite schools who had dozens of hearings under their belts over top 14 grads who had none. On the flip side, my current employer rarely hires new grads, and the few newer attorneys we have are top students with fed clerkships. \n\n2) Your application matters\n\nYour responses to the online or paper application matter. Your answers are usually graded by a H.R. person who will score your answers. The highest scoring applicants will be passed on to the hiring attorneys for review. Incomplete or lacking answers will cost you. We will read your cover letters and writing samples. Small typos here and there are forgivable, but you should absolutely make sure your documents address the correct persons and be as immaculate as possible. \n\n3) Be prepared for your interview\n\nGovernment interviews are not like private practice interviews. The screening panel interviews will have very little give and take. It is again about scoring your answers against a metric. Give complete and full answers to questions. Do some research about the agency you are applying to. Know the policy positions of the leadership. Have a couple of questions in your pocket for the end. If you are applying for a jurisdictional that you do not live in, be prepared to explain why you want to go there. Also, criminal agencies will often require a mock opening/closing and will have a hypothetical exam. Wear a suit. If you are going to interview with a trial heavy agency, dress as if you were going to trial. Remember that a trial attorney represents the management, and you want them to like the way you carry yourself.\n\n4) Once you land the internship\n\nWith little exception, an internship will not lead to a permanent offer. This is due to civil service rules. However, you should absolutely treat your time at the office as an extended interview. Do as much as you can as well as you can. Try not to say no to assignments. Complete assignments in a complete and timely manner. Ask for help. Ultimately, we know that you are law students and are working for free (usually), and we would like to help you get as much as you can out of the internship. For good interns, I have written letters of recommendation, been a professional reference, and made phone calls. For subpar interns, I don’t offer this help, and if a hiring attorney calls, I am honest in my assessment. I’ve seen former interns get adverse hiring decisions based upon the reviews of their supervising lawyers. \n\n5) Money\n\nMost of these internships are unpaid. The few that pay are very competitive. For those applying for attorney positions, you will find relevant salary and benefits information on the government H.R. website. Salaries are generally lockstep based on the criteria set forth in the job classification and are thus non-negotiable, but there are exceptions.\n\n6) Great, but where do I find these jobs?\n\nMost of these jobs will be advertised on the agency’s website or on the jurisdiction’s (city, county, state, special district) general H.R. website. There will be occasional OCI interviews in both the spring and fall. Even if there is an OCI, there may still be a requirement to apply online.\n\nGood luck!",

Idgaf ;)\n\nBut for some reason in this sub I’m seeing a lot of people who are considering dropping out because they’re not top 10%, for their first B, fee burned out, etc.\n\nNow, I love this thread and all the people in it.  No doubt I appreciate you all, but please be willing to hear me out if you are considering dropping out.\n\nIf you drop out of this because of a little setback, what sort of pattern are you setting for yourself?  If you switch into another career path, why won’t you just quit that, too?  (Not saying you will, but patterns of past behavior speak volumes to one’s chances of future success).  Anything worth  doing/having will not be easy.\n\nWe also need to have realistic expectations.  Expecting perfection is not always realistic.  Being realistic is a huge part of law.\n\nStop comparing yourself to other people, regardless of the fact that the curve asks for it.  Do what is right for you and live your life, enjoy the ride, and don’t take things too seriously.\n\nAnd asking people for advice on whether you should quit is not as good ask asking yourself.  A lawyer needs to be self-assured (in a healthy way, at least).\n\nAgain, not trying to be a d*ck.  I just want everyone to be happy and healthy in all senses of the word.\n\nI’m getting grades back this week and - again - am not expecting anything amazing.  And you know what?  My self-esteem is larger than that.  My ability to become a good lawyer is not about my grades, it’s about resilience and growing.  And I will be solid.  Those of you who want perfection and are considering dropping out might fail to achieve success because of this all-or-nothing thinking.\n\nWith blessings,\nLoud Scarcity",

My Lsat score is above the top 25% among all 1L students, and my last semester's grades are better than the median. But I feel so bad about law school, and my classmates are horrible. \n\nPeople who I thought were friends talked shit behind each other. People use gossiping about other students' mistakes or failures as ice-breakers/interesting topics to impress the students they want to get along with. \n\nAt first, they treated me nicely, but after they heard my accent as an ESL student, they didn't even pretend to keep some manners. \n\nI provided outlines to my friends during exam period, which I got from a senior student. I bring signature snacks from my country to classmates.  I just don't understand what they would lose by being friendly. Does it hurt to make friends or at least have some connection with people from different cultural backgrounds? My future career plan does not conflict with their interests. I want to practice in an area that requires a second language. We are not even competitors but would be the others' connections who practice different areas of law. \n\nAfter some students who ignored me knew that my grades are better than theirs, they suddenly changed their attitude and started talking to me with a careful tone. How ironic!",

        "text": "I am very disappointed with my grade, although I anticipated it. I take accountability for overlooking what additional time can do. I also believe that the test administrators and especially the office of disability should have anticipated this problem as well. It is very difficult to accept a grade that I know is not even a close reflection of my knowledge in a class. In fact, I was most prepared for this exam, yet I got a C+. I received an A and B+ in my other classes this semester. \n\nI have ADHD and was granted 100% additional time because I am not allowed to take my medications while breastfeeding. Contracts was my first exam. I was assigned to a distraction-free room in the library and told that I had NINE hours to take the exam. I expressed my shock and was told I did not need to use all the time allowed. This was not a solution because I was granted this time after a careful review that determined that I needed it. \n\nI did well in the first two essays during the exam, but when I reached the short answers, my responses declined to a few words. I did not attempt to answer the last essay question, not because I ran out of time or I did not know the answer, but because I left the exam room in the worst state of panic and could not comprehend words anymore.\n\nMost of my exam time is wasted on losing my train of thought while reading and writing my answer and finding the words to express what I know and studied. I have to reread multiple times and highlight/ write on the exam in as much detail as possible to help me refocus. \n\nTaking an exam for 9 hours was extremely difficult and stressful. All I had was an apple and a bottle of water. I was unsure if I was even allowed to leave the room and go to the bathroom. No one was there on that side of the library, and no one came to check on me. I was afraid to do anything that would be interpreted as cheating, which included taking my phone out to call the office or leaving the library. I desperately needed a break; I needed to leave the room and felt claustrophobic after being there for many hours. I had a panic attack while attempting to answer the rest of the questions and could barely comprehend what I was reading. I had to make a very difficult choice to close the exam and run out of the room. I still can't believe it. I start panicking when I think about that day in the exam room. It felt like death. The whole night was a blur. I felt disoriented until the next day. I opened my bag to find my detailed color-coded outline thrown in there like it was garbage. It was absolutely traumatizing :(",
