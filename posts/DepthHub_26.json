Which deserves to win? *(3 months of Reddit Gold will go to the original writer, and 3 months will go to the submitter of the post the community chooses.)*\n* **Best Overall Submission (Thread):** What was the best multi-post/discussion submission this year? Which had the best exchange of ideas? *(1 month of Reddit Gold will go to the submitter of the thread the community chooses.)*\n* **Best Overall Submitter:** Who submitted lots of home-run posts this year?

It must be a single person who has not deleted their account or removed themselves from their submission. This includes posts and comments which have since been removed or deleted.\n* Please include as much data as possible when nominating, and make a good case.\n* Winners will be chosen by highest number of upvotes.
