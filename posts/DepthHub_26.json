Which deserves to win? *(3 months of Reddit Gold will go to the original writer, and 3 months will go to the submitter of the post the community chooses.)*\n* **Best Overall Submission (Thread):** What was the best multi-post/discussion submission this year? Which had the best exchange of ideas? *(1 month of Reddit Gold will go to the submitter of the thread the community chooses.)*\n* **Best Overall Submitter:** Who submitted lots of home-run posts this year?
