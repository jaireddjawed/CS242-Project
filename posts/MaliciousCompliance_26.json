        "text": "Dunno if MC or PR, but maybe you like it anyways.\n\n\nBackground: I do 1st level chat and e-mail support for a  mobile network operator and normaly give basic support for questions about bills, do help people with network problems and filter problems out, that have do be done by 2nd level or some other department. We also help people with questions about MNP, which is taking your phonenumber from one provider to another. As this can easily get fucked up, we dont do it ourselves, but we can see if something went wrong and what the client has to do to make the MNP work. \n\n\nSo the client enters the chat and asks about the status of his MNP. As this takes about 10-14 days and he just ordered it, I tell him to wait until he gets an e-mail from us. That e-mail either tells you why it didnt work or when the phonenumber will be taken over by us. He absolutly tilts of the earth as soon as he hears that it takes up to 14 days. \n\n\nI tell that it takes so lang as we have to be careful with MNP, as the phonenumber can be lost and it also takes quite a bit of time because we cant do it internally but have to talk to the old provider. He doesnt like any of this and rights multiplie times in JUST COPY AND PASTE I NEED IT FOR MY BUSINESS.\n\n\nI tell him I can escalate it to the department that is responsible for that topic and he says yes. Well he doesnt know apparently that by our conditions, we do not take any businessclients. So i escalate it to the deparment that checks for frauds, credits and declines clients in generell. \n\n\nLow and behold 24 hours later his contract was cancled by us.",

        "text": "I work in a branch where meticulous track keeping of activities is often required, and as such, there are a ton of specific templates for various types of documents that are be established; e.g. meeting notes, internal note, project information sheets, technical notes, letters, fabrication follow-up, as built checks, start meetings; you name it.\n\nAs such, even for small meetings or conference calls a meeting report is established to capture the discussions and archive these.\n\nNow, often the only way to encourage people to  archive the meeting notes in the official documentation system is that the meeting notes template is so easy that it literally takes 1 minute of extra effort to issue the notes as opposed to typing them out in a mail.\n\nRecently some of the most useful templates were abandoned for a generic ‘full report’ template, forcing upon everyone to issue an unnecessary long report instead of the one page meeting notes template before. Employees were instructed to abandon these easy templates for a more time consuming process.\n\nNow is where the malicious compliance takes over;\n\nSince it was no longer allowed to issue a simple report, I created a generic ‘full report’ template document where I only state that the information is contained in annex to the report. Since the annex can contain any type of document, nothing can be done against this method.\n\nThis way it takes me less time than writing the notes in the new template, but is increases the workload of the secretary office a lot because they now have to archive two documents instead of one. \n\nTake this for several documents a week and I wonder how long it will take for the management to discover the lost time with their new and easy system.\n\n**TLDR; Company wants generic template for all reports instead of easy task specific system previously in use; Wanting to be in compliance, meeting reports are now at least 6 instead of 1 page long, doubling secretary work in the process**",

        "text": "I work as a bagger/cashier at a grocery store. We have normal checkout lanes where anybody can come through and express lanes for 10 items or less. Usually, the baggers will avoid the express lane because the cashier can handle bagging just a few items on their own so the baggers are better spent bagging larger orders and helping customers out to their cars. Occasionally, someone will miss the sign or just come through the express line anyways when they have a large order. Most of the baggers have learned it’s important to help bag that order quickly because people with just a few items are waiting behind someone  who came through with a cart full of items. Assistant Manager tells me today after I had just helped bag a large order from an express lane “Don’t bag on the express lanes. It’s a waste of time. I know it’s easy but we don’t pay you to do easy work” I start to try to explain that the customer has clearly missed the sign or whatever and had a whole bunch of items. He cuts me off mid-sentence, “No buts, just don’t do it.” “Yes, sir” I say and head off to bag on a regular lane. An hour or so later I see another customer come through the express lane with a full cart, I almost go to help bag, but remember what he said and thought I’d enjoy some malicious compliance. The two regular lanes have one customer in each line, and a bagger already at the the end too. No lanes for me to bag on, nobody’s cart to unload, so I stand idly by waiting for a regular lane to open up, and periodically taking glances at the full express lane. A line is starting to form at the end of the express lane and groceries are piling up at the end of the register. Assistant manager walking towards me, \n“quit standing around and bag that order down there!”\n“But its an express lane”\n“Stop messing around, he’s got more than 10 items”\n“I see that. Last time I helped out you told me no buts.”\n\nGrumbles a little and apologizes. I bag the order and assistant manager lets me make decisions for myself for the rest of the day. Hopefully today will be the end of the micromanaging the baggers and cashiers know him for. ",

        "text": "One day I came back off my weekend to find out my department screwed up bad. What I was told is that a file with very strict performance guarantees arrived 8 hours late to the client causing about a $15,000 fine. The reason it was late? We did not call the on-call group about this problem.\n\nNow, I already don't like this group because their boss has a habit of making temporary processes permanent. So I message my friend on our voice team and have him pull our call logs from that day. Low and behold we did call them about 30 seconds after sending them an email with info. By this time it is too late to damage control this so all our big wigs think we are inept.\n\nSince this teams manager passed the blame off on us we got a new requirement. This team now requires us to open a ticket to them, send a page through our paging program (which goes to the on-calls cell phone), send an email with the ticket and a description of the problem (done automatically when you open the ticket so this is a 2nd email), and call 4 people on their team. One of them being the manager I do not like.\n\nEvery single time I start the phone calls every single one of them complains to stop this. I inform them that this is because a problem they ignored for 8 hours and incorrectly blamed us has created this rule. It's especially satisfying because the person that put this in place and complains the most about it? The manager I do not like. I call her last that way it's slightly later in the night.\n\nTL;DR - Manager who lied and I don't like put in a process that she doesn't like and I follow the process to the letter.\n\nEDIT - removing a bunch of so's",

        "text": "This could get interesting.  We just got handed a new rule today at work that ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING we do has to be documented in the time tracking software.  It was much wordier than this, but it was very explicitly laid out that every.  Single. Thing. Must. Be. Documented. Down to copying the text of emails, content of phone calls, etc. They basically said that we couldn't be trusted to do our jobs without giving them the most minute detail of our daily work existence.  So,  I sat down at my desk, logged in, then entered in the system that I logged in at 8:00 AM.  Then I entered that I logged my login time.  Then I entered that I logged my time log entry.  I spent all day entering into the tracking site \"Entered time log for entering time log\"  My whole team has done nothing today but log time entries for logging time entries. Can't wait to see how this turns out tomorrow.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Update:\n\nSo on our morning call, our department head (boss) said that we were going to be joined by our president today (Internal \"mwahahahahahahaha\").  He got on, and here is a transcript of what he said (Yes, we use all sorts of colorful language on our calls): \"OK guys, we get the point.  We fucked up.  We thought a little more detail would be helpful in your time tracking entries, but Jesus fucking Christ, you all took it up a notch.  We should have worded that better, and we probably shouldn't have sounded like assholes when we sent that directive.  Let's just pretend yesterday never happened, we'll roll that back, and please just make sure your time entries have enough detail so we know the gist of what you were working on.\"\n\nAfter he left the call, boss says \"You glorious fuckers.  I told them this was a shit idea, and that they should expect something like this from you sarcastic shits.\"\n\nMoral of the story:  Never put smartass developers in a loop they can't escape.  We'll keep going as long as we have to.",

        "text": "So I stay in a country where the race relations are probably at its worse since the 1st democratic election back in 1994.\n\nAnyways, because of what some old white dudes did way back when there had to be a policy to correct the past. This is called Black Economic Empowerment or BEE. Some people call it Affirmative Action.\n\nThis was much needed to equal the playing field but it did not work out at all, because of a corrupt and incompetent government who does not give a damn about its people but rather in lining their and their families pockets with millions and millions of rands. Our government is one of the most corrupt and incompetent governments ever!!! \n\nSo after 23 years of a free and open system for everyone and also 23 years of giving black people the better opportunities, best bursaries, best positions and 99% of ALL government positions, BEE is still being implemented harshly!\n\nNot to make this too political but, being white excludes one from specific and very attractive shares in a company,it also counts against you if you apply for a managerial position or want to further your studies in your workplace. \n\nThese benefits are sometimes very exclusively held for black only employees even if they make up 95% of the workplace.(White people make up 8% of the total population in my country).\n\nWell that changed a while ago, how you may ask? Easy, just start identifying as African, because technically I am African, I'm a white African. My family have been staying in Africa for more than 10 generations, so we are African in blood and bone.\n\nSo now, when I have to complete any company or government form, I mark my race as African and not white.\n\nGot send credentials to access the application to check on the growth of my new shares today. Even have a black comic as my profile picture! I applied as an African employee :D\n\nAlso going to apply for the online Leadership and Organization course and after that a few other online courses where I do not have to be physically present. \n\nDo not know how  long it would take for the company to pick up on this but ah well, I got my African shares, just like all my black African brothers and sisters :D\n\nOh how I love being African!",

She is a branch manager for a sizable home health care company, and like the name implies she works over 3 branches but is only paid for one. This is due to some bad decisions by her boss whom is laughably unqualified and everyone knows that the only reason he is even in the position he is in is because of blatant nepotism. Despite this, she has kept these three branches afloat while all were significantly understaffed, managed to acquire/keep 2-3 hundred patients in each, and she actually brought two back from the brink of being discarded.\n\nThe upper management caught wind of this and some of them came down to the branch she was actually paid to work over and she was congratulated because she had gotten an award for her branch(es?) being the most successful in the company of the past year, they were also there to learn just how she was doing it. Her boss had told her shortly before the meeting that she was to only say positive things and not make him look bad, cue MC. She agreed to not say anything negative, but only because she didn't have to. The meeting started and the pleasantries were dispensed, the staff were congratulated, etc... then they got down to business, they started by asking how she was doing it and she answered to the best of her ability, saying nothing but positive things like she had said she would. This is where her amazing office staff stood up for their leader, they started talking about all of the things that she had to put up with, the lack of concern from her boss, the uncooperative and in a couple cases corrupt nurses, the potential patients she had to turn down because of under-staffing, and the way she handled all of it with a cool head and a calm demeanor. Then just to put a fine point on it they told the management about how my mom was told to only say good things.\n\nThis only happened today so we have yet to see any of the results from this, but i can only assume that management will have a few words with my moms boss. Anyway this was my first post sorry if it has too many grammatical error, and please put any critiques on how i can make my posts better in the comments.\n\nTL;DR Mom's boss tries to keep her quiet about any problems, forgets that her entire office staff looks to her as a den mother.\n\nedit 1: added tl;dr",

You can read the previous story [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8zjtl9/store_manager_insists_that_he_is_always_right/).\n\nSo it was Christmas, in case you didn't realise our Christmas is in the summer when its hot, and I work in the seafood department. And the heat and seafood don't mix well together.\n\nA customer comes up to me and orders 3 dozen oysters, knowing that it's hot outside and overhearing that the customer and her husband needing to go and get some Christmas presents afterwards, I asked them if they wanted a  small bag  of ice to keep the oysters fresh.\n\n**Customer:** No, I do not want you to sell me some ice. (apparently they thought that was trying to sell them the [10kg bag of ice](http://moreice.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/More-Ice-10kg-bags-web-232x309.jpg) that the store sells)\n\n**Me:** No, its free, we use the ice-machine at the back.\n\n**Customer**: No, like I said, I don't want you to up sell me the ice.\n\n**Me:** Ok then (fully aware that it was awfully hot outside and that the oysters would go bad - usually at this point I would attempt to explain that the ice would keep the oysters fresh and would prevent them going bad in the heat)\n\nThe customer then leaves the store after making the purchase. \n\n30 minutes later, I get called to the front desk to deal with a problem. And lo and behold the same customer was at the front desk was yelling that the oysters we sold them had started smelling a little bit and if we only gave them some ice or something cool that it wouldn't had gone off. \n\n**Me:** Hi again, \n\nThe customer then sees me shellshocked (perhaps she was thinking that I finished my shift or had gone off to lunch - in fact I was on my lunch break when I called to the front desk).\n\n**Me**: Well, I did try and ask you if you wanted ice to keep it cool. \n\nCustomer then looks unhappy and has no choice but to leave the store knowing full well that its their own fault.\n\ntl;dr Customer doesn't listen to the employee and learns that the hard way that a lot of retail employee don't try and upsell them stuff because they don't earn commission.",

        "text": "Lurker here, trying my first post. I think this fits MC, but let me know if it doesn't, I'll remove the post. English isn't my first language, so please excuse my bad english \\^\\^'\n\nThis might be long, so I'll leave a TL;DR at the end.\n\n\\***Context**\\*: I was in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets for 5-6 years. It is a leftover of WWII, so it uses a military structure, but is not meant to be a military training movement. We do drill (parade stuff), but apart from that we have courses about aviation, leadership, etc and do sports and visit museums. Summer camps offer advanced training, so older cadets become instructors for the new recruits. Plus you can receive pilot training scholarships (gliders and little planes) if you are dedicated (which is why I was there for so long).\n\n*My squadron*: It was small and had a major favoritism problem. A girl (called DS from now on) of my age was winning all awards and trophies, her mother was an officer (an adult, cadets are 12-18yo) and managed to become the best friend of the Commanding Officer (CO) of the squadron. They tried to mask it once, which kinda backfired but marked me as a rival for said awards and trophies (those help get scholarships, so I needed them). They hated anyone challenging their favorite (DS), so they hated me for my 2 last years. I got the glider shcolarship and was a fresh pilot for my last year in the cadets. I intended to get the motored plane one, so I just needed to cruise the last year without getting in trouble. A discipliary report against me would doom my shot at the scholarship, and CO &amp; DS knew this too well.\n\n\\***Story**\\*: Begining of the year, the \"staff\" (cadets with a rank higher than \"cadet\"(=private) ) meets with the officers and the posts gets distributed: Cadet Commander (CC), his deputy (DCC), Drill-Sergeant (DS), Flight Commander (Me and someone else), their deputies, Flag guards, Drum major. So DS is now drill-sergeant, which is a higher post than mine. Furthermore, she's responsible of the squadron's discipline, meaning she'll be after everyone and filing disciplinary reports rather easily. That's not good news for me, a Flight commander (a \"flight\" = platoon). At the end of the day, CO and DS call a meeting with me and CC + DCC. It goes as follows:\n\nCO: \"I've been in the cadets in my days and everyone knows about the Leadership/Pilot rivalry\"\n\nShe's reffering to the fact that some go to the Advanced Leadership camp and come back full of themselves and start loving rules and protocols. CO, DS and DCC all went there. Others, like me, go to Pilot camp and come back full of themselves and start not caring about rules and protocols. The recipe for a rivalry is there and can be seen country-wide.\n\nCO: \"Just to let you know that you can't just ignore the rules, like your pilot friends. I don't care who you are, you HAVE to follow the rules. The squadron's rules aren't exactly on par with the APD201 (Cadet manual/rulebook, the Bible of the Leadership people), but that's going to change.\"\n\nDS: \"Yes. You'll have to follow the APD201 TO THE LETTER - or I'll make sure disciplinary action will be made.\"\n\nCO: \"Exactly. Plus, as you are a Flight Commander now, you are responsible of your cadets.\"\n\nDS: \"That means if they lack discipline, YOU will get in trouble too!\" (smug smile)\n\nCC didn't seem to care about this meeting, but DCC, which is responsible of the \"staff\" was intrigued. DCC was beginning to be a friend of mine since he was the one hated on before me and knows about the favoritism. After the meeting, I warned him that I will follow the APD201 to the letter and that it might cause some issue with the usual squadron rules. He replied that he didn't see any problem with that, as long as I do follow the rules and since it's the order I'm given.\n\nNow, no one is expected to have even seen the APD201 except for the leadership people, which learned it by heart as far as I know. I also know that DS isn't the type to actually do real work and has probably found a way to pass the course without learning much. I know that DCC must've learned it by heart due to his work ethic (making him a fair judge for me). And I'm the biggest nerd of the squadron, so I tend to learn fast. I found the APD201 online and only then realized that it's just a drill book. A manual for how to do parades. Digging deeper, I find that \\**some*\\* rules are expected to be followed outside the parade square (like saluting officers in hallways) and* \\*so*me\\* others seemed to have been extended without clear definition (like the role of basically all posts to fit their parade positions). This is potential for Malicious Compliance and I start my search for rules that are at my advantage and at the disadvantage of the DS. I also see a bunch of symbolic protocols, like putting everyone at ease then at attention when taking command of a squad, that I will interpret as mandatory procedures (you MUST put everyone at ease then at attention to take command).\n\n*Week 1 of MC*: We start courses and I happened to be the only aviation-related instructor (&gt;50% of courses given). This was meant to overload my schedule to prevent me to go fly gliders, but I digress. I start my class with military drill protocols, as instructed in the APD201. Recruits find pilots cool and my over-zealous drill funny. I'm following all the protocols and I explain the meaning of them (as my interpretation of mandatory procedure).\n\n*Week 2 of MC*: A random officer tells the flight commanders to go do some basic drill exercise with their flights (recruits can't do the \"attention\" stuff very well yet). While praticing, the DS comes and supervises the drill exercises (as she should).\n\nOut of the blue, she begins calling a command (military term for yelling stuff like \"Squadron, attention!\") and notices that none of my cadets obeyed (thanks to what I did during Week 1). \n\nShe is apparently pissed and calls \"Flight #1, attention!\" and I signal to my cadets to not budge. \n\nShe is now furious since I clearly just told them to ignore her. \n\nShe comes to me.\n\nDS: What do you think you're doing?!?\n\nMe: As per the APD201, as a drill sergeant, you are not allowed to give commands to a single flight. You only have authority over the entire squadron and must ask the flight commander (or his deputy) if you want a single flight to do anything.\n\nDS (visibly annoyed): Well, move them then. I want to practice marching.\n\nMe: No.\n\nDS: What?! I'm your superior! Do as I say!\n\nMe: As per the APD201, the drill sergeant doesn't have authority over Flight commanders; the Deputy Cadet Commander does. Since we have the same rank, I'm not obligated to follow your orders. Plus, I have an order from an officer to practice attention.\n\nDS: This is BS.\n\nDS tries again to give a command to my flight and I clearly say \"Don't move, I'm the one in command, you must ignore her right now.\" Cadets don't budge.\n\nDS (now really pissed) gives up \"FINE!\" and goes back to her squadron leading position and give a command to the whole squadron, that my cadets still ignore.\n\nDS: WHAT NOW?!?\n\nMe: You should know this! As per APD201, you must \\[procedure to take command\\].\n\nDS: UUUGH!!\n\nShe does the procedures and I go sit down. She doesn't even try to guess why (when commanding a squadron, the DCC must order the Flight commanders to take position, otherwise they aren't considered to be on the parade square) and goes on with practice.\n\nAfter the practice, she comes to see me.\n\nDS: This was insubordination! I'm going to file a disciplinary report! Forget about that scholarship!\n\nMe: Nope. As per APD201, DCC is the one who can file reports against Flight commanders.\n\nDS: Pfft! Ok then!\n\nShe tells everything to DCC. DCC comes to see me, laughing.\n\nDCC: I told her \"Well... He's right you know. The APD201 does say that!\" You should have seen her face!\n\nI kept doing that sort of stuff all year.\n\n*Week 12 of MC*: At the end of drill practice.\n\nDS: Now, the midyear parade is coming soon. You need to practice your drill. Flight #1, you are sloppy out of the parade square; you are to follow the drill rules in the hallways too!\n\nEveryone is sloppy, but hey, why not single out my flight. As we should \"lead by example\", I take it upon myself to do EVRYTHING in a drill-style fashion (moving as if I was following commands, so I basically look like a robot): eating, drinking, peeing, washing my hands, stopping to talk to someone, talking. My cadets finds this HILARIOUS and start doing it too. DS ends up seeing 2 of them drinking water.\n\n(Paraphrasing since I wasn't there)\n\nDS: You think this is funny!?! How dare you! Blablabla\n\n(I arrive while she's yelling at two of my best recruits)\n\nMe: Excuse ME! WHY are you yelling at MY cadets?!?\n\nDS: They-\n\nMe: I DON'T CARE! I'M the only one allowed to yell at them, I'M their flight commander. YOU have no right to discipline my cadets! If you have a problem with one of them, AS PER APD201, YOU come to yell at ME as if I'd did myself! THEN \\*I\\* discipline them as \\*I\\* see fit. YOU should NEVER discipline one of my cadets! They're MY responsibility. If THEY do something wrong, you report ME!\n\nDS: FINE!\n\nShe leaves to find DCC and I turn to my cadets.\n\nMe: You did this because you saw me do it, right?\n\nCadets: Yeah...\n\nMe: Then you have strictly nothing to feel bad about. You did everything right! You followed my example :-)\n\nCadets: :-)\n\nMe: You can never be in trouble for doing something you saw me doing. If it's wrong, I'll be in trouble and warn you to not do it. Because of that, if someone not from our flight tries to discipline you like that, tell them to see me. Tell them that I ORDER you to ignore their disciplinary action. I'm the one who has to be blamed for this kind of stuff, because they can't know if you did it because I did it first or not. Now, don't mess around or I'll displine you, but otherwise keep up the good work! Oh and stop doing the drill thing, we're apparently not allowed to do that \\^\\^' :-P\n\nSeveral minutes later, DCC comes to see me.\n\nDCC: \\[Tryford\\], can I talk to you in private?\n\nIn private, DCC bursts out laughing.\n\nDCC: What the heck was that?!? Did you really yelled at her \"I DON'T CARE! REPORT ME!\" for something your cadet did?!?\n\nMe: Yup. XD\n\n\\[skipping half the conversation\\]\n\nDCC: But yeah, she told me the story, well her version of it. I replied \"Well... He's actually right! And I won't report anyone for drinking water in a drill-like fashion; they only followed your order as far as I'm concerned. Plus, you can't go around and yell at recruits like that! I heard you! I should be reporting YOU!\"\n\n(I ended up winning the \"Best sergeant\" trophy at the end of the year, under the recommandation of CC and DCC. DCC and I became good friends)\n\n\\***TL;DR**\\*: Was in the cadets. Superior (with the Commanding Officer's approval) who hates me order me to follow the cadet rulebook to the letter. Turns out, I found a rule that allows me to ignore most (if not all) orders from said superior and block them when addressed to the subordinate under my command. Only possible thanks to her direct superior being a fair judge (which became a friend of mine).\n\nEdit: words.",

        "text": "A few years ago, there was a government position I was selected for that had a base requirement to be in the Army Reserves, rank didn't matter. I was going in as a GS-5. My counterpart would be a GS-7, both of us working for a reserve unit's HR department. At the time, I was a lower ranking Soldier (E4) while my counterpart was a bit higher (E6), but rank didn't (shouldn't have) mattered since we were employed as civilians. Everyone (including other Soldiers) aside from my counterpart (Sarah) treated me as another civilian. \n\nSarah's military job was HR whereas mine was not, but I had experience. In the beginning, she took me under her wing and taught me about the different forms and how to file, be in compliance, etc. Problem was, her knowledge was severely outdated as I soon learned when I had been sent to multiple weeks of training (broken up). Every time I came back, I told her what was being taught now. When she'd send me tasks, I'd let her know that the requirements had changed. She became flustered and pettily said, \"Since you know more than me, an 18-year Staff Sergeant, you do this then.\" She began sending me ALL of her assigned tasks, including ones that had a strict deadline that were due within 2 hours, but she had 2 weeks to get it done. She was trying to get me in trouble. \n\nSo, I started doing both her work and mine. When we were sent an email from Battalion (our boss staff) that was directed at her, I would immediately reply all, \"Sarah, I got this.\" After the 4th time, I received a call from our boss at Battalion, Geo (GS-11) asking me why I was doing everything. I explained that she decided the workload fell on me. He was silent for a bit before saying, \"Ok. Keep up the great work. I'll start sending you the tasks.\" I had zero problems with this as I proved I could handle it all. Geo and the other Battalion staff began sending me all of the work that was meant for Sarah. \n\nCome our bi-weekly conference call Battalion began asking about said tasks, but didn't ask me about them (only the ones I was primarily responsible for). They asked Sarah. She would try to say that she tasked me out to do it or claim that I didn't complete it. Battalion would then come down hard on her and say, \"Actually, badgerfu completed these. I want to know why you didn't. Do you sit at your desk and play games?\" After the conference call was over, she stomped down the hall to my desk and demanded to know why she didn't know about the tasks. I smiled and said, \"Because according to you, these are my responsibilities now and Battalion has started sending me the tasks to complete. They know you have trouble with deadlines.\" She huffed, \"I'm a Staff Sergeant, Specialist.\" I replied, \"Not here you're not, and you're certainly not my supervisor.\"\n\nThis went on for MONTHS, but in the end I was selected to go to all of the training that was meant for her and was promoted internally to work at Battalion while she didn't even get a step promotion. I received awards for my hard work, while she received a certificate of appreciation. The Soldiers trusted me over her. Battalion helped me with my malicious compliance and in the end I was rewarded.\n\nLast I heard, she took a deployment, didn't tell anyone, and just left. Needless to say, she lost her job on bad terms.\n\nEdited for better clarification, due to too many acronyms. Sorry, habit of abbreviating.",

        "text": "I work as an amateur dance teacher on the side of my studies, and in that line of work I've met some wonderfully motivated students whom I've helped out to the best of my abilities to get started on their competing career, but also quite a few nutcases. The worst one was a woman who absolutely insisted she was an extremely talented dancer being held back by her partners, and refused to put in any work whatsoever whenever practice included anything she didn't consider \"worth her time\", such as basic technique, improving rhythmicality or partnering skills. After all, she was already way better than her partner, so why bother? \n\nIn reality though, she was barely better than beginner level despite years of \"practice\", and definitely did not have any talent whatsoever. And that's okay, you don't need to be great at something to do it for fun, and I'll gladly teach anyone interested in learning without caring the slightest bit about whether they are good at it or not, because there's no feeling that beats seeing one of your students improve.\n\nNow this woman was always trying to guilt trip me into giving her favoured treatment, claiming I was the reason she didn't improve faster, that I didn't give her enough lessons, that I failed at teaching her partner to be worthy of her, and even claimed that I should become her dance partner because she \"had enormous potential for growth\" and was \"already at almost the same level as I was\". Not true of course, someone on a beginner level is not quite comparable to someone trying to get their foothold in semi-professional events.\n\nI of course did not appreciate her behaviour one bit, because she always had this condescending tone as if she considered herself to be the one at charge during my classes or lessons. Never mind the fact that someone trashtalking their own practice partner is just about the most detestable person I can imagine. You are supposed to work with, not against each other. I myself am not a big fan of the \"customer is always right\" policy, but will admit there's some truth to it, so despite feeling like it I did not straight up ban her from attending my classes. Instead, I waited for her to begin one more of her rants about her own excellency, I just waited for her to finish, and then queue some malicious compliance:\n\n**Me:** You know, you're right. I have not been able to help you improve at the same rate as my other students, and I do feel bad about it.\n\n**Her:** Yeah, so how about we keep some extra lessons on Sunday, I can't really afford to pay, but it's about improving your students, not pay, right?\n\n(Technically correct, I do give generous discounts to some of my students I know have low income but put in a lot of work and love the sport, she's neither low income or a hard worker though)\n\n**Me:** No, I don't think that would help. I have come to believe that my teaching methods just aren't suitable for you personally, no amount of lessons from me could make a difference. I think the best way would be for us to part ways, you should find yourself a teacher that fits you. With that, let's end today's lesson early, you won't have to pay for it.\n**Her:** But...\n\n**Me interjecting:** Now I know that you've enjoyed your practice here and wouldn't want to leave it behind, and as you said, you have your goals set high, so you should find yourself a professional teacher. I'm just an amateur, after all. Thank you for your time, I wish you good luck in your future endeavours.\n\nAfter that she was quite visibly in shock and couldn't gather herself to properly answer, so I simply turned to the couple who I had the next lesson with and told them we could start early, thus taking away any chance she had at disputing it then and there, knowing full well her pride would not allow her to beg me to turn my decision around later on. Alas, I have not seen or heard of her since, which I am very grateful for. I absolutely hated every minute I had to spend in her presence.\n\nNote: Conversation translated from Finnish, so not 100% accurate to the letter, as I was more concerned with translating the meaning behind the words.\n\nEdit: Formatting improvements for better legibility\nEdit2: As it turns out, the correct form is \"cue some malicious compliance\", not \"queue some malicious conpliance\", thanks to u/Spidron for correcting me :)",

I was told that I cannot do that so then I spent 8 hours a doing exactly 40 orders an hour and watching pod casts. Again, management tried to say that I need to do more.

We were told that from then on whoever was working on the end of the line was to write down how many parts were completed every hour and add excuses on the write if there were extenuating circumstances for not completing our goal. This led to a few amusing compliance:\n\n\nOne guy turned in nothing for the first couple of hours one day, his excuse was \"Packing up second shift BULLSHIT\" (the guys on second shift technically completed their parts, but didn't package them so they could make more parts to claim). We were instructed not to swear on the board any more. \n\n\nOnce I wrote down my production as one part short of the goal with the excuse, \"lost time filling out the hourly board\". \n\n\nMultiple excuses of having to take a shit. \n\n\nAnd most appropriate of all: banking. If you were on a roll and running ahead of the goal (not hard at all), what are you going to do? Put up the higher numbers on the board so Bossman starts expecting it? Hell no! Write down that you made goal and complete the next hour's work 90% of the way, then during the next hour complete them all real quick and fuck off for 55 minutes. That's not really the kind of thing you could get away with in most places, but my assumption is that at most places the Supervisor would supervise you instead of relying on a whiteboard to do his job for him.

        "text": "A little background. I work in sales for a marketing company. I have been with the company for 3 years and over these 3 years I have been the #1 sales person since month 3 of my employment. I have brought in over 3 million dollars in production for the company. \n\nI recently decided that I wanted to move to another state. So my wife and I packed up and moved to LA. I left the company for 2 months but I really liked the company and of course the money. I decided to come back and work remotely. While my employer was a little hesitant they agreed. After a couple of months they decided they wanted to terminate my remote employment. Stating that there was lack of accountability into my work. Basically the ceo liked to go into the sales floor and micromanage us. Since I am no longer in the office he can’t do that. The problem is all my calls are tracked and recorded, I created a google sheet so they can see all of the people I am working and all the leads get distributed from the sales director. Everything can be seen except for my face. So this is where the malicious compliance comes in. \n\nI was informed that my employment would be terminated unless I found a way to “make sure I am working” \nThey want to know everything I said and every call. I was pissed at first after 3 years and being the best sales person the company has ever had you have the audacity to question my work ethic? So in order to comply I am now tagging the ceo and sales Director in every. Single. Note left by me in our system. Not just a simple left message on cell note. No full on “when I called I felt a little warm as it’s 110 degrees outside. It rang approximately 5 times before his staff answered. It was Kim, she stated he wasn’t available at this time. I left my name and number and company for him. She thanked me and I asked when would be a better time to talk to him. She replied In a very short tone that he will be busy all day and to try tomorrow. I replied I will do that thank you Kim and we hung up.”\n\nNow I make 60-70 calls a day so their inbox is just going to be completely full of these incredibly detailed notes because they want to know everything to make sure I am working correctly. \n\nEdit: A few people have asked for an update. I posted this yesterday and I Started doing this yesterday so as of right now nothing much from Management. One email was sent saying “good job on staying diligent.” Even though I had less calls yesterday because I spent more time writing those notes they seem to be ok with it. They let go some other sales people that were in the office a few weeks ago and he said the biggest issues were the kinds of notes that were being left by them. They got unnecessarily descriptive when they were “checked out.” \nHe ends the email by trying to be positive by telling me to stay focused. It’s like they think I forgot how to do my job in a 2 month absence. \nTo the people saying I should take my talents elsewhere. I am very heavily considering it. ",

        "text": "At my place of business we have our own note system that we take notes anytime we have an appointment or have any sort of phone communication with our clients (This helps in situations where clients will try to say that we never helped them or made an attempt to help them so they try and cancel our services as well as knowing what the last technician or account manager has said to the client). I benefit from knowing what was said on previous appointments especially when I was not the last person to talk to them and the majority of the time I am talking to the same people as they specifically request to talk to me when they set any appointments. Now we had some people that were not leaving good enough notes in the system. For me i take notes as im on the phone with them so that I don’t leave anything out and make sure all is documented. Since we had some people that didn’t leave good notes at all this lead to some cancelations that we could not appeal a cancellation or chargeback as there was not good notes indicating such things. First thing you need to know is this notes system is our own proprietary software it runs off of a server that we host and on that server there is limited space. Well since we had those chargebacks that went through our client retention or cancelations department sent out an email stating from now on we are to put in notes in our system for any sort of contact that we have with our clients. One of my other job responsibilities is to answer emails that come in from our clients and on any given day i can have as many as 60 emails coming in overnight some that only require quick answers or canned responses and others that may require more than a simple canned response to give better instruction and some of the clients use email like a chat service. So when our client retention sent an email out saying to leave a note no matter how we communicate with the client I had responded back and asked if that included emails as well. The response i was given was \"Yes that includes emails NO EXCEPTIONS!\"\n\nNow in my mind that was just ridiculous and a waste of time and would chew up a lot of my time putting in notes for replying to an email that a client had sent in and on multiple occasions several replies within the same day. Well i decided you know what im going to comply with that. I logged in the first day that I had put in around 300 notes in our notes system spread out over multiple client accounts. Now remember that server that holds all that information? Well not only myself but some of my other coworkers followed suit as nobody wanted to get in trouble for not leaving a note. At the end of the week we had received word via a phone call not to come in to the office as our notes system which also contains contact information for each client was down due to the overwhelming amount of notes that have been put in crashing our system. So i got a nice free day off because we would not be able to contact clients that day.\n",

        "text": "I work in IT for the UK arm of a large company, whose head office is in another country.\n\nBecause we're fairly small, we tend to be able to respond to requests quickly, and can use our judgement to help out where head office IT might hide behind their SLA (an Service Level Agreement that says we will respond to you in x hours, etc.) This is most typically when we get a new hire - sometimes the departmental manager won't know until the Friday afternoon that they have a new starter on Monday morning. Head Office will point out that they need two weeks' notice for a new starter, but in reality it doesn't work like that.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a number of systems that only Head Office IT have access to administer, therefore no matter how quickly we sort something out, we're relying on someone overseas taking pity on us and responding before their SLA says they have to. Often, this means we're waiting for a New Starter to be set up on a core system for up to two weeks. No amount of chasing or escalation can change it - their SLA is their SLA.\n\nThis summer, Head Office decided to get rid of our entire local HR team, and parachute in a single person as a replacement. I have no idea why they didn't just retain at least one person who knows what they're doing, but there we go. A bunch of redundancies, one newbie. We have no idea when this is happening, where this person is going to sit (the current HR office is now being turned into a meeting room) or even their name. All we know is, our current HR have been given leaving dates - some are gone already, some end of July.\n\nFriday afternoon, a package of stuff arrives from our central supplier - a brand new laptop, big monitor, wireless keyboard and mouse, all the top end stuff. We have no idea why, but suspect it could be for this newbie. I email the supplier and Head Office IT, but get no reply,\n\nMonday morning, I'm out at another site dealing with a massive issue (local IT guy isn't technical and has accidentally deleted an entire virtual machine, and its backup. But that's another story.) so one of my colleagues phones to tell me the new HR person has arrived, and is hoping to pick up her laptop and be shown to her desk.\n\nThe poor girl is clutching a letter from the head of HR at Head Office, saying to report to site at 9am Monday. The head of HR works roughly 1,500 miles away. Newbie has no idea what's happening, but that's still more than we do.\n\nIn my absence, my boss (who's a finance manager, really) takes control. \"There's a two week SLA on new starters from the date you submit the form. We've not had a new starter form yet.\"\n\nHR manager emails me directly. I reply briefly that I'm busy fixing a technical issue offsite, and to escalate any concerns to my manager. It is only at this point that we actually get confirmation that this new kit is for HR newbie, and that it needs setting up asap.\n\nMy boss points to the SLA, and advises that they will be up and running within two weeks of us receiving the form. Which they still haven't done.\n\nThis morning, I go to inspect this new kit. It's a brand new model which we don't have a build for, and it hasn't been pre-imaged as any kit that we ordered would have been. That's going to take 2 days to set up properly at least, plus anything else.\n\nHR Manager emails both me and my boss, admitting that she should have submitted these forms, and told us about the kit, but could we hurry it along? My manager points out the SLA, and references 5-6 instances where we've been stonewalled by them for the exact same issue. HR manager finally relents; \"ok, so she'll be up and running by Monday 6th August?\"  \nMy boss reminds her; \"SLA begins when the forms are received. We've still not had the forms.\" Ha! Amazing.\n\nSo, we're still duking it out. In the meantime, I've set up newbie with a generic login so she can do her health and safety videos and stuff. My boss is adamant that we wait the exact two weeks. This could have all very easily been solved had they just called or emailed beforehand to say \"btw, is any of the kit from the other HR people we made redundant still usable?\" - because it is, and would take about ten minutes to set up.\n\nTL;DR: For years we've been inconvenienced by our Head Office's IT department rigidly sticking to their two week service level agreement for new starters. They've sent a new starter down to us with no notice, so we're making them stick to their own rule.",

        "text": "This is an old tale about a co-worker. To this day, I'm not sure if this was accidental or intentional MC. I lean towards intentional. \n\nIn my area, people who would like to become active in local politics usually start by making their name visible in the community. One way to do that is to get tapped as a board member for a charity. The owner of the company where I worked had aspirations to become a political figure. (And he still is today.) \n\nHe volunteered as chairman for a charity fundraiser. This was the type of fundraiser where you convinced people to donate a portion of their paycheck each month, which was taken out as a deduction at payroll time. If a chairman was successful at this fundraiser, he would very likely be nominated for the charity board. The charity \"suggested\" that a chairman should have at least 97% compliance at their own company as an example. \n\nSo every employee was pressured hard to contribute. \n\nBonnie was a long-time employee. She wasn't smart in many ways. She couldn't handle an Excel spreadsheet. She had trouble adding a column of numbers. But she was excellent at customer relations. She always remembered names, had a sweet and helpful disposition, and was a ninja at calendars and appointments. She was our front desk receptionist. The customers loved her and always remembered her name. \n\nBecause of her deficiencies, she was never promoted off the front desk and she never got a raise. \n\nWhen the charity campaign happened, Bonnie was adamant that she couldn't afford to give away any of her money. \n\nAs the campaign participation rate climbed closer and closer to that magic 97%, the pressure on the employees got more and more intense. Finally, it came down to the point where each individual holdout was getting a one-on-one education about how helpful the charity was. \n\nBonnie got her one-on-one with the owner himself. She didn't budge. She just kept saying over and over that she couldn't afford it. Because she was so bad at math, the owner decided that she simply needed to learn how to budget better. He volunteered to show her how. She happily agreed. \n\nSo one day, Bonnie brought in all her monthly bills and bank statements. The owner took her into a conference room and helped her work on her budget. (The other employees, me included, watched with great interest.) After about 3-4 hours, the owner came out of the conference room, dazed and shell-shocked. \n\nBonnie gathered all her papers and retreated to the break room for a coffee break. Of course, aaaallll the employees needed a coffee break, too. \n\nBonnie, being the happy and talkative person she was, had no problem talking about what happened. Turns out that Bonnie had a very well-constructed budget and managed her money wisely. She didn't have room for any extras, though, because she hadn't gotten a raise in so long. \n\nBut now, everything was great! The owner worked over her budget, couldn't find any room, so he decided she needed a raise. Bonnie told him that was wonderful because now she could afford to add HBO and other extras to her cable package. Owner tried to explain that wasn't what the raise was for, but Bonnie asked if *he* had HBO. He had to admit that he did. So if he had HBO, why would she need to sacrifice her HBO for his charity deduction? \n\nOwner caved and agreed that she deserved HBO if she wanted. He added another raise. She was delighted because now she could get &lt;thatotherthing&gt; she'd never been able to afford. He tried to explain that the raise was for the charity deduction, but once again she asked if *he* had &lt;thatotherthing&gt; and if he didn't need to give it up for the charity deduction, why should she? \n\nIn the end, she got quite a large raise. Everything she'd always wanted she could now afford, plus enough left over to contribute to the charity drive. \n\nSo, she complied with the request to contribute. Now the company was at 100%. \n\n\nBut, Bonnie explained, that was okay. The charity drive was only for a year. The raise was permanent. So, that was almost like a guaranteed raise next year, wasn't it? ",

        "text": "Uptown got its hustlers, the bowery got its bums, and the first time I heard that Jim Croce song, I knew it was really about my daddy.\n\r\nDad was an MP at Da Nang, so while he wasn’t actively a target most times, he saw shit. He was there for the Tet Offensive. He was at the gate when the nearest barracks took a direct hit from rockets and he watched as the guys came out in pieces and on fire.  Little kids would run up to eat the bugs the spotlights attracted and he got to decide if these were just kids or really young Charlies about to shoot the idiot gate guard (they were just kids). He was patrolling the armory when *that* took a direct hit, so he got to see a couple million bucks of artillery go off all at once from really close up. His housekeeper’s husband ate his dog. All in all, he did not have a good time.\n\r\nWhen the military cut him loose, the landing resembled the wet bar on the Hindenburg: visible, catastrophic, and filled with copious amounts of alcohol. He eventually came up for air shortly before he met my mother. He didn’t just have bark on him, he had the whole damn tree. He wasn’t too sure why the pretty blond hippy lady wanted to date him, but he was gonna try the best he could not to fuck things up. He really wanted to impress her AND her family.\n\r\nUnfortunately for Daddy, my mother’s family most closely resembles a sack of rabid cannibalistic cats halfway through dining on each other. My mother was and is the only sane one. He did not realize this at first, but oh God did he learn.\n\r\nNow, despite being sober, my dad frequently took my mother to bars. Not for the booze, but for the pool. In the unemployable stage of his alcoholism, Dad made his living snookering suckers at the pool tables. He kept his hand in once he sobered up because figuring out the necessary english to hook one ball around another helped the world make sense. He hated disco because all the good clubs took out their pool tables and put in dance floors, and that was just unforgivable. When he and Mom went out, he ordered tonic water so the bartender would ignore him, restrained himself for a couple games with Mom, and then mopped the floor with anybody dumb enough to challenge him. \n\r\nSo Dad didn’t quite understand what was going on when the Queen Cersei of my maternal lineage, my aunt, invited him and my mom to a bar so they could “visit”. Dad knew academically that most people socialize via alcohol consumption. He figured they were gonna shoot a couple friendly games while they got to know each other. Mom, sweet summer child being her default setting, assumed the same thing. But my aunt invited her sister's recovering alcoholic boyfriend to a bar *specifically* so that he would have to watch as she and my uncle, the Ultimate Dipshit, attempted to drain it of intoxicants. Somebody around her was vulnerable and she needed to take advantage of it for her own amusement. Her goal, which remained unchanged for the next twenty-five years, was to get my father drunk. The Ultimate Dipshit was glad to help her because it meant *he* could drink, and to him alcohol was the one true meaning of life. \n\r\nDad caught on real quick, ‘cause when your hobby is fucking with people, you recognize when someone wants to screw you. He ordered his tonic water and stuck to the parts of his life appropriate for polite company. Cersei and Dipshit weren’t polite, of course, but Dad really wanted to impress my Mom and didn’t think eviscerating her family was going to do the trick. \n\r\nThen the Dipshit, for some reason, became fixated on Daddy's pool skills. He decided that Dad was not as good as Dad claimed, and basically began poking him with a verbal stick. Why don’t you show us how good you really are? How about a nice game? Man to man? Cause you a man, right, dude? I mean you got that nice military record and that makes you a man, right, dude? Right?\n\r\nDad did not have enough sobriety or distance from Da Nang to respond. He knew that beating the Dipshit in pool wouldn’t give him enough satisfaction, and beating the Dipshit into the bar would get him and the cute blond lady he was dating thrown out. He was kind of used to getting tossed out of bars, but he *really* wanted my mom to like him. So he drank his tonic water and did his best to be a very sober rock. \n\r\nAnd then the Dipshit did it. He pulled on Superman's cape. He spit in the wind. He made his play for the lone ranger mask and he chewed on my Dad's last goddamn nerve. He pointed at the piece of shit pool table in one smoky corner and said “You liar, I bet you couldn’t even clear that table over there.”\n\r\nDaddy looked at the piece of shit table and registered that it was *seriously* a piece of shit. Improperly leveled. Plywood bed at best. Pilled felt, stained and nasty. He drained his water, turned to the Dipshit and said, “I bet you everyone's drinks tonight that I can clear that table with a broomstick.”\n\r\nDipshit said, “you just go do that, then.”\n\r\nWith all the malice a Vietnam vet in recovery can muster, Daddy complied. \n\r\nHe politely asked the bartender for the pool balls and the broom. After he racked ‘em up, and somehow managed to get the cue ball to stay put, he unscrewed the broom head and chalked up the blunt end. And while he could not beat the Dipshit in reality, he spanked my uncle’s drunken little ego into the ground by sinking every single ball, with a final little flourish on the 8 ball at the end. \n\r\nHe walked back to the bar, screwed the head back on the broom, gave it to the bartender, got my mom a beer, and then ordered another tonic water on the Dipshit's tab. \n\r\nDad is currently recovering from a massive stroke. He’s lost his mobility and most of his language, and we aren’t sure if he’s gonna get any of it back. My heart is pretty broken over the challenge he faces and if I think about it too hard, I cry. But I’ve heard this story from him, my mother, and Aunt Cersei herself, and that tells me that no matter what, people are gonna remember my daddy.\n\r\nThat’s why I’m telling his stories.\r\n",

More than likely they’ll win a state championship four or five times in six years.\n\nMy partner and I had worked together before and we tend to let teams play. Just tough basketball, grind it out, and let’s get going. Now girls basketball can be pretty rough. I’ll also admit that we missed some pretty blatant calls on both ends. By the end of the 1st half we had only called 8 fouls total. To be fair it could be higher but we let both teams play. At one point one of the coaches from out of town yelled about how they always get screwed in {hometown}. He almost got thrown out of a JV game that had no real significance besides pride.\n\nEveryone in the stands, the coaches, and the sidelines are yelling at us to call more fouls. My partner and I talk it over and we called 47 fouls in the second half. Now we were in the wrong for not calling as much as we should. But we were getting yelled at literally any time the two teams touched each other. Both teams ended up shooting free throws two minutes into the quarter and the game went like two and a half hours. \n\nI almost quit reffing after that game. Getting yelled at by strangers was bad. But my own family yelled at me. That was even worse. I still get dirty looks from people who were at that game from out of town. ",

        "text": "When I was in high school a Cold Stone Creamery opened in my town and a bunch of my buddies and I were the first people employed there. The owners were awesome guys and really went above and beyond for the employees but one of them had his parents manage about once a week (age in the late 60s, early 70s). They were absolute assholes and had this ridiculous need to take out their life's frustrations on a bunch of high school kids. \n\nFor those who don't know, when you tip a Cold Stone employee they are supposed to sing certain songs about ice cream to make the atmosphere fun - something we all did and we did it well. For whatever reason, the owners parents were never satisfied with our singing no matter how much effort we put into it. A few months in my best friend was promoted to team lead and helped with scheduling. After a lot of tension was growing about our singing, we hit our limit of patience. He made sure that all of \"our group\" (friends outside of work) were on a Saturday night shift together when the owners parents were going to be there and it would be busy with lots of customers. \n\nWe were so outgoing and talkative with customers that evening that we were getting tipped uncontrollably and when we did, we sang LOUD. Only problem... We went out of our way to sing like tone-def, pre-pubescent morons who couldn't hit the right note if our lives depended on it. It was hilarious to someone who was there for 5 minutes to grab ice cream and go but to a manager that was stuck for 6 hours listening to the same 5 songs sang every few minutes, it was torture. Despite their anger, it's hard to say to a kid \"sing better\" with high expectations, especially when the majority of us were mid-puberty and voices we're already naturally cracking. The owner's dad looked like he was going to have a heart attack that night and his face was as red as raspberry sorbet. \n\nAt 31, I still visit that Cold Stone and giggle every time. Ironically I've reconnected with the parents over Facebook a few years ago and they are always commenting on the photos of my kid saying how cute he is. Life has a funny way of working itself out. \n\nEDIT: We purposefully sang horribly. We were all pretty good singers. ",

        "text": "I have been a long time reader and decided to post this malicious compliance I saw while I was in the chair at my local hair salon. Tldr: at the bottom. Also I am posting this from my phone so please forgive any typographical errors.\n\nA bit of backstory: I decided to go the big platinum blonde today. For those who dont know, this means literally hours up to a full day in the salon. Because the stylist doesnt want to waste time while I am processing (bleaching) they will get other appointments to do alongside me. Normally this is not a problem and is standard practice. This is not a normal salon either,  the place where the salon is located is not busy/almost dead so it is by appointment only as there is only the owner and his sister who use this location. Also the owners come from a very strict asian family who immigrated legally from South Korea but they have maintained a slight accent. \n\nWell at this point I am on hour 2 of my fabulous blonde journey where my stylist (the owner) takes in his second appointment of the day.  Around this time my hair needs to be rinsed and processed again before he can see her so the owner's sister takes her back and begins to listen to what she would like. Lets have the new  customer be MM for manager mom since her hair screamed \"I need to speak with your manager\" and the owners sister as OS and the owner as O. \n\nOs: What would you like done today? We didnt quite get a chance to hear from you as you said you just wanted a quick appointment and weren't clear on the line with what you wanted.\n\nMM: I thought I was very clear, perhaps YOU.....DIDNT....UNDERSTAND.....ME .  I want a dark cherry color all over with magenta strips along my face. \n\nShe said this with the most condescending attitude I think I have ever heard. Almost like she thought she was talking to a small child who didnt understand english. Basically slower and louder.\n\nOS: Well I cannot promise anything but (owner) should be able to help today\n\nI can only assume she asked so she could block out the time and am guessing they had quite the conversation beforehand. Well it was time for me to process again (yay blonde) so I sat next to her in my seat reading reddit as I waited for my turn. The owner begins her consultation and this is how that went:\n\nO: So I overheard you wanted to add some color today? \n\nMM: Yes I want a dark cherry color with magenta stripes. And I dont have a lot of time so can you please just slap the color on?\n\nO: Of course I can do this, however bleaching requires me to...\n\nMM: I...said....color!!...no bleach!! \n\nO: I am sorry Ma'am but I will need to bleach your hair in order to get the magenta color to...\n\nMM: I dont have time for bleach!!\n\nThey continue this for a little until MM decided that she knew more and told him (the owner) that she knew the owner and he always did her hair with no bleach. So then he shoots a small glance at me and begins his malicious compliance. \n\nO: Alright Ma'am how would you like me to do your hair. Please be exact so I can follow it to the letter.\n\nHe reaches and pulled out a small pad and pen\n\nMM: I want you to just mix the color and put it on. Do I have to do your job for you?\n\nO: alright ma'am so I am doing what exactly?\n\nMM: I WANT YOU TO ADD CHERRY RED INTO DEVELOPER. MIX IT AND APPLY IT TO MY WHOLE HEAD BUT THESE TWO STRIPS. As she is saying this she is tugging two strips along her jawline. \n\nMM: then just add the MAGENTA color to THESE STRIPS. Is there someone else who I can talk to who understands and can translate?\n\nO: No need, I understood. I will do exactly that\n\nSo that is exactly what he did. Showing her every step and required her approval for each thing. I.e ok so you want this in this developer right? And i just mix it? Ok... And just add this color directly to your hair without any mixing? Ok...\n\n The cherry red turned her hair into a reddish brown (which is what she wanted) however the magenta color did not look any different then the color she had before. I.e no magenta, the color must have washed out. \n\nWell the owner kept her from seeing the final product until the very end. And before the reveal:\n\nO: Just to be sure.. I followed your directions exactly yes?\n\nMM: Yes, after I had to do your job for you. \n\nO: Alright well here it is.\n\nDramatically spins her around\n\nMM: WHERE IS THE MAGENTA?\n\nO: It is there ma'am however as I have explained earlier you need to bleach your hair to get it to pop out. Now... As you said everything was followed to the letter I will have my sister check you out. I believe the total comes to $290 \n\nMM: I am not paying for this!! I am not happy I demand to speak to the owner! Maybe some one that speaks...ENGRISH!!\n\nO: Very well, I will go get him.\n\nThe owner then goes and grabs a jacket from his office putting it on and comes back. \n\nO: Hello ma'am I am the owner. I believe we are out of time and I gave you EXACTLY the service you requested and need to service other guests, please pay at the front desk.\n\nHe then leaves her not letting her respond  and goes back to doing my hair. \n\nThe lady paid then shortly left. He told his sister to blacklist that customer\n\nTldr: Racist Lady tells stylish how to do her hair after being told it wont come out correctly. Stylist does hair exactly as she wanted and she wants the owner. He is the owner.  \n",

        "text": "Over a couple of summers, I worked for an overnight summer camp program for a local college. This program specializes in teaching kids technical skills (i.e. Programming, Robotics, etc). My job was to plan, create, and instruct a weeklong course based on a specific technology.  During the day, we would focus on teaching, while we did typical summer camp stuff during the night.\n\nFor those who haven't worked at a camp, typically the industry standard is to be paid at a weekly rate. The hours working can vary wildly between whether or not one worked overnight on a certain day or was helping with camp duties. Thus, a per week rate simplifies the process. People who worked overnights were paid a premium, but everyone considered the pay fair \"for a week's work.\"\n\nFor my program, I was tasked with teaching a class about a set of hardware. Every student would get to take this hardware home with them at the end of the week. So, in the class, we would set up the hardware, show off some cool things they can do with it, and then let them loose at the end of the week to use the hardware.\n\nThe issue was, however, that the hardware is the anti-thesis of reliable. Each day, a quarter of the class' new hardware would break down. There were a couple parts in the hardware that had a 1 in 2 chance of failing within a couple hours of installation. If a student had lucked out with perfect hardware, they were golden. However, many would have to have their hardware parts cycled out multiple times until it would be consistently working.\n\nBy the end of each program, we were usually able to ensure that the student's hardware would be in reliably working fashion for them to take home. However, that assurance did not come without sacrifice. Every night I had off, every break I was given, every moment I could spare was spent in the classroom working on the various non-functioning hardware. This hardware was necessary for me to be able to teach the class. At the end of the program, the parents and the students expected the hardware to be perfectly functioning by the end of the week. Parents could not just send the hardware back for repairs, y'know. Thus, I understood that it was my responsibility spend my free time fixing the hardware. After all, I was getting paid \"for a week's work.\" It wasn't too bad to fiddle with cables in an air conditioned room away from kids. However, I won't sugarcoat and say that it wasn't an frustrating experience. But I was able to make it work and the parents always left the program satisfied with what their child brought home.\n\nIn addition, I was not the only one doing things for the camp outside of working for kids. There were various activities that counselors worked on and helped out with that would make camp more exciting and fun. This involved preparing pranks, skits, activities, or even just briefly joining an on-duty night counselor's activity to lighten the load. Even if you were not on-duty during the night, you were usually doing something for the camp. This involvement helped create a fun and engaging camp experience for both campers and counselors. These summers were some of the most enjoyable and rewarding experiences I have ever had.\n\nHowever, going into what would become my final season, some major changes were made.\n\nThe administration announced that for the next season we would be getting paid on an ***hourly*** rate. This move immediately came off as weird to most of us. I mean, weekly rates have always been the industry standard at every camp job I worked before. There was a rumor that one of the new guys that quit last year complained that he was being ripped off for how many hours they worked, but no one could prove if the rumor was true.\n\nQuick aside: Weekly rates when divided by hours worked can look like a ripoff. But this is no industry secret. You're getting paid to hang out with kids. Most of the time, it's pretty laid back. Regardless, one's weekly take is still higher that what one would make at a 40-hour minimum wage job.\n\nEither way, our director (who reports to the administration, but is typically on our side and handles in-the-moment personnel and client issues) assured us by showing that the hourly rate is higher than what the weekly rate was considering our hours. I like money, so I was excited to finally get a pay raise going into the new season.\n\nFirst day of the season was pretty typical of how first days go. I had the first night off, so I was preparing myself to fix the Mt. Kilimanjaro of hardware already on my desk. During training, they were instructing us that we needed to clock out at 5 if we weren't working at night. Now, that is typically when those who have off are let free. However, since everyone usually did something for the camp during their off nights, we figured that we were supposed to just punch out whenever we were done with our tasks. No one actually thought that they expected us to \\*STOP\\* working at 5.\n\nWell, 5:12 comes and I am still just cleaning up my room from the day, when for some reason an admin walks in.\n\nAdmin: What are you doing?\n\nMe: Oh, just cleaning up, then I got to...\n\nAdmin: Did you clock out?\n\nMe: Well, no I still...\n\nAdmin: You MUST clock out at 5.\n\nA switch flipped inside my brain at that moment. You see, I was no longer being paid \"for a week's work.\" I was getting paid for how many hours I worked and the administration would not allow me to go over their allotted hours. My mentality changed immediately.\n\nSo I responded:\n\nMe: Ok. Sounds good.\n\nI leave the room as is and lock the door.\n\nAdmin: Don't do it again, or you will be written up.\n\nIt didn't take long for us to realize that was a veiled scheme for the administration to cut everyone's pay. By offering a higher hourly rate than what we got before, they were able to convince most of the veterans to come back thinking they were getting a raise. When, actually, we were forced to work less hours. Everyone's weekly take was significantly less than what they were in previous years. In addition, since it was a flat hourly rate, overnight counselors made twice as much as those who did not. Even though the overnight gig requires significantly less focus, preparation, and effort compared to the day programs.\n\nEveryone was pissed.\n\nIt soon became the norm that once their \"shift\" ended, they were done for the day. Gone are the prepared skits and activities. Those who had their nights off simply retreated to their room or went out. We weren't getting paid \"for a week's work\" so why bother making it special.\n\nIn the case of my class, that meant that I stopped repairing hardware in my free time. I then only repaired hardware during class periods. This caused the class to slow to a halt. By the end of the first program, my class was only able to get through about half of the material and 20% students had to go home with non-functioning hardware. I felt terrible, I genuinely did. But what could I do?\n\nCamp received some pretty rotten emails from those parents that week, but everyone stood up for me knowing how much time was taken from me to fix. That's pretty much how much of that summer went. The magic of camp was lost and in its place were increasingly upset parents. Most of the veterans, including all directors and leads, left at the end of the summer. The camp still continued on, but for my friends and I, it was no longer the place that was pretty alright \"for a week's work.\"",

        "text": "TLDR: Owners son pulled power play on group lead, ended up paying us for a full days work for only a couple of hours worth of work plus got banned from managing moving crews.\n\nIn college for a couple of years, I worked with one of the many local moving companies that used cheap college labor to haul people's stuff around during the season. The team lead,   was a quiet bull  (QB) of a man who gave no sh!t but took none of it either. He was a professional mover, i.e. the guy that can put two straps around a fridge and walk it up three winding sets of stairs and not cause any damage to walls, ceiling or device. \n\nHe also could estimate the volume of stuff in a room or house that required moving and know how much space it would take when packaged and secured  and which truck to use for each job. It was an impressive talent.  His personal life was a mess and he was always getting together and breaking up with the same woman for all the years I knew him, may have had some problems with drinking and the occasional assault but nothing kept him from coming to work and was always the professional.\n\nThe owner of the moving company, knew QB was talented and reliable and paid him an hourly salary, plus profit sharing of the business. He also let QB do what he did best and kept all paperwork and administrative things out of QB's way. \n\nWe were now at the end of the season and we were no longer running from 6am to 8pm moving peoples stuff for six days a week. I had started school again so I was only available on weekends. Most of the time I would work for most of Saturday and the occasional Sunday but nothing much happening otherwise.  This particular Saturday we had been called for an estate clearing, i.e. go in pack and move all the furniture that had not been sold or whatever and move it to the company's storage facilities. As the moving company owner was on vacation, his son OS, decided to come and look after the crew and make sure the business can run without his father (this is sarcasm btw). \n\nThe son was exactly what you would expect from someone who grew up lacking nothing and working on a business degree.  The way the jobs worked, QB would go scout ahead at some point during the estimate and schedule the moving date, make sure that the crew would have either the 9ft, 15ft or semi for the job and get the moving blankets, dolly's etc ready for the days moves. For this job, he had determined that even though the estate had a lot of things in it, the 15Ft truck would suffice since items could easily be stacked with no issue and moved to storage without damage.  For estate/storage jobs since there was no time constraints, we usually got paid hourly which was regular plus  a couple of extra bucks since there were no tips.  We were expected to be efficient but not having a specific timeframe, as we did not need to be somewhere else afterwards.\n\nDay of the clearing, my self and the other knucklehead of the crew show up and theres QB, red faced and looking very miffed, there's OS and hes pulled out the semi. The conversation taking place was that the estate was being billed for the  15Ft truck and that the semi was overkill. OS was arguing, saying that whoever did the estimate was wrong and that he had gone over and determined that the semi was appropriate.   QB was not happy and we could tell.  When he was like this, we minded our own.\n\nBefore we left to go to the estate, we got our stuff ready and heard QB talking one last time with the OS about the size of the semi and how the 15ft was easier for this move.  OS feeling his authority questioned, told QB that he was wrong, the estimate was wrong and that the semi was what was needed. He also told QB that once we got there we were to fill the semi up and not move an inch until it was full. We were to leave nothing behind and once the truck was full, make it back to storage where OS would be expecting us to unload. \n\nQB got that look of  a cement block settling and very quiet. He just nodded and motioned us to get in the semi and get to the estate. It was 8:30am when we arrived.  The usual tedium or sweat, grunts and lifting of stuffs and boxes took place.  This was a five bedroom house with mostly furniture and bedding, dressers etc  no appliances and a room full of boxes. QB was pissed so he burned his energy moving the biggest, heaviest pieces by himself while we got the other things that needed moving. It took us about three hours to finish loading. At that point less than a third of the semi was full, since QB was also packing and securing everything for the transport part. \n\nOnce done, we did  a couple of walk throughs, picked up scraps of packing and cleaned up after ourselfs. QB got that nice smug look, locked up the truck, motioned us to follow him. We then went to the back of the house where there was a nice yard with some shade, sat down on the lawn. Around lunch time we got some pizza's and soda's and went back to enjoying the quiet suburban settings we were in.  It was a nice fall day so we all dozed off at different points. \n\nAround 4:30, OS arrives with his nice BMW, looks at the truck loaded and locked and starts looking for us. He finds us in the back and starts screaming at me and the other guy, with the occasional look at QB. QB takes a breath, gets up off the ground where he was napping, rotates his neck and shoulders and walks up to OS who's now starting to look visibly concerned. QB repeats back to him that his instructions were for us to move when the truck was full.  The truck was mostly empty, so we did not move. He also reminded OS that we're still on the clock and for him to decide how he wants to play this as we still had a couple of hours of work to unload at the storage warehouse. \n\nOS started to say something, but QB's look may have looked like someone waiting for an excuse to lay some whup-ass. He made a face saving attempt to inspect the house and make sure nothing was left, which was not and then told us to take the semi to the warehouse for unloading and storage.  We unloaded in less than an hour since we were nice and rested from a day of napping outdoors.\n\nWhen the owner returned he called QB and us for an explanation of what happened and why his son was complaining about 'slow, lazy workers, taking advantage of the company'.  QB told what happened and how his son's instructions caused the issue. The owner knew enough of QB to know that he did b.s. and did not suffer shit well.   End result, OS was never allowed to run any moving crews again while QB was with the company or countermand standing estimates, ever again.  ",

Helen lives in one of the 4 houses that encircle the cul de sac. \n\nSo a few years ago, Helen proposed at our monthly HOA meeting that our street is too narrow for emergency vehicles like fire trucks or ambulances to fit through and she’s worried that they won’t be able to reach the cul de sac houses in an emergency. Which is bullshit. It’s  not a thru road so only residents of this small street ever need to use it. Sure it can be a little tight at at times but two lane traffic moves comfortably (and it rarely ever needs to because it’s a quiet neighborhood street with not much traffic.) Fire trucks can and have been accessing the cul de sac since the beginning of time. \n\nBut Helen was on a power trip and she wanted to have one side of the street curb painted yellow to restrict the parallel parking on the street. This move was heavily opposed because it would significantly limit street parking in our neighborhood. Plenty of people raised concerns that there wouldn’t be enough parking and this would affect the value of their homes. And since the street parking was first come first serve, it would create undue competition between neighbors in securing a parking spot on our street. \n\nBut Helen pushed back saying that safety was more important being able to find a parking spot. She said there’s always plenty of room to park on the cul de sac if need be. It shouldn’t be an issue. And after much deliberation, we put it to a vote and the motion DID NOT pass. The highly unpopular curb painting would not be happening. \n\nOr so we thought. Helen went to the fire department a few days later and voiced her concerns. She told them the neighborhood residents had her support in painting the curb. And on a Monday afternoon while everyone was at work, they painted the curb yellow. \n\nWe all came back home that evening to find that our available parking options had been cut in half. People were livid. One neighbor is particular was having none of it. You see he owned a small boat which he typically kept parked on the street. But now that parking was significantly reduced, he decided he would find a better place for his boat. He waited for Helen to leave for work the next day and parked it right in front of her house on the cul de sac, per her suggestion. The look on her face when she came home to find her usual parking space taken over by a boat was almost worth the whole ordeal. And since he rarely ever took his boat out, it stays parked there in front of her house pretty much year round. \n\nAt the next HOA election, she was voted out. The next president got the curb painted back to normal but boat guy still parks his boat in front of Helen’s house. All is good in the world. ",

And we never make appointments, we have a set schedule, we stay out of the way when we’re doing work.\n\nM: Okay well I’m here now, would you like the work done or not?\n\nRG: We are not prepared to accommodate you and I’ve been calling [other company that contracts us] for months!! \n\nM: oh? And what did they say?\n\nRG: Nobody has come!!\n\nM: I work for them and I am here.\n\nRG: Well we will only work by appointment with a technician who is *regular* and the same person and they need to call ahead. \n\nUp until now, the manager isn’t making outrageous demands, he’s just being difficult. I can understand wanting to make an appointment, we never have to do it since we do our work when nobody is there, but I understand. Refusing every technician for the past few months while complaining you never get service is fairly silly, though.\n\nSo I leave and I call him the next time I’m on that route. I have also learned since then that one of their bars is in a Men’s Club that doesn’t allow women in it under any circumstance. I address this issue on the phone and it goes as follows...\n\nRG: After some consideration to our Men’s Club and its members, we’ve decided that it would be best if a man did this job.\n\nM: No problem! We will send a male technician as soon as we hire one.\n\nRG: thank you!\n\nWe only have female techs in this area. He probably didn’t fully understand that we literally have to hire a man to do this one account so that could take a few months. Enjoy your dirty beer at your Men’s Club until then, Rude Guy.",

        "text": "I'm an announcer for a small town radio station.  It's a few days before the fair.  I'm working at my desk, when the boss comes up to me.  She tells me that she's the volunteer coordinator for the fair this year, and as a show of the station's support for the fair, she's getting all of the station employees to volunteer.   \n\nNow, when your local fair comes to town, it's one of the busiest times for your local radio station.  We're broadcasting live from the fair grounds, we're interviewing the artists who are performing, we're emceeing the shows, we've got contests going on in conjunction with the fair...all kinds of stuff.  Doing all this, I figured I'd be far too busy to take tickets at the front gate or empty trash cans or whatever extra duty the boss was trying to give me.  So I remind the boss that we're doing all this, and I decline to volunteer.    \n\n\nBoss is having none of it.  Says she's already got everyone else in the station signed up, and I'm not being a team player.  But I hold firm.  We're going to be too busy doing our regular fair duties to take on any more.  She finally loses it.  \"Look.  I'M on the organizing committee which means I decided who gets on site and who doesn't!  And I say if you don't volunteer, you'll have to find your own way on site!\"  And she storms off in a huff.  \n\nSo I grab the phone and I call up the president of the organizing committee.  I ask him, \"Hey, I'm still getting my media pass, right?\"  He says, \"Of course!  Why wouldn't you?\"  I tell him what the boss is doing around the station, and he lets out a sigh.  Apparently, she'd been power tripping on the organizing committee, too.  He tells me to swing by his office in the next day or so and he'll personally give me my media pass.  \n\nAt the end of the day, the boss comes up to me with a smug grin.  \"Now that you're had some time to think it over, what would you like to volunteer for?\"  I look at her and said, \"I don't have to volunteer anymore.  You told me to find my own way on site, so I did.\"  She had no idea how I did it until I showed up for the first day of the fair and flashed my media pass at the front gates.  ",

        "text": "Some background/explanation for those unfamiliar with US Navy terms:-\n\nLPO = Manager. Usually E-6 rank.  \n\nWCS = Assistant manager. Usually E-5 rank.  \n\nChief = Department head. Usually E-7 rank.  \n\nEOOW = Engineering officer of the watch. Basically guy in charge of all ongoing engineering operations that day. Sits in Central.  \n\nCentral or CCS = Place on ship where you can monitor alarms in the engineering spaces (6 on my ship) and control certain things.  \n\nInspectors = Bunch of senior enlisted personnel, typically experts in their field and also outranked everyone in this story.  \n\nGSM = Gas turbine system technician, mechanical. Consider the GSMs as one section, while the GSEs are another section.  \n\nGSE = Gas turbine system technician, electrical.   \n\nDivision = For this story, both GSM and GSE are in one division under Chief, but we do slightly different work. We typically know each other’s jobs and cross train.  \n\nQuarters = Meeting every morning with your whole division to make sure no one died or is in jail, and to pass down instructions.  \n\n8MC = Engineering PA system.  \n\nEOSS = Book that walks you through how to handle any engineering casualties, like a fire.\n\nThe story:\nSo like I said before, we work together and cross train, even though we’re trained to do different things. It’s common for us to “borrow” each other’s junior sailors (E-4 and below), to help get work done and to cross train them. Especially with a big inspection coming up (INSURV), we have trainers and inspectors onboard to prepare for it, plus we just came in from a 10-month deployment and the ship is due for a few engineering overhauls.\n\nEnter new LPO for the GSMs (GSM1) He’s usually pretty quick about taking my guys to help his, but hates it when we need help from his guys. He outranks my LPO and she’s all buddy buddy with him anyways, so often I’m left to do my work by myself or sneak one or two of my guys back in the afternoon to get work done and train them for inspections. This happens when my LPO is out on medical leave and I’m in charge of my guys.\n\nMonday morning, he grabs all my junior sailors without asking, so I’m left to do all the work myself. At some point during the day, I need help carrying a 75 lb piece of equipment. I snagged one of his guys who was heading in the same direction anyways, and we haul this thing across the ship to CCS. GSM1 was in there shooting the shit with one of the inspectors, saw his guy helping me and decided to wave his dick around. Screams at me for “abusing my rank (I’m an E-5, a WCS and the other guy was an E-3)” and that I was to “never ever ask a GSM for help ever again (a lot of our work involves working together. Literally. On the same equipment, just different parts of it).”\n\nTuesday morning, at quarters, GSM1 goes on a rant about how GSM and GSE do different things and we all need to train within our jobs for inspection, so there is to be no more “sailor swapping.” Fine by me. My guys and I go to our office (Where there is no 8MC, important for later), I walk them through the maintenance and inspection stuff for the week and decide that we’re going to do maintenance on all the tank level indicators (TLI) on the ship. Much faster as a group, as there are about 20 of them and its 30 mins per. Part of this maintenance is having to notify the EOOW and coordinate if there are other maintenance/work going on, since these will set off a constant alarm in CCS once disconnected and if it goes off when we have contractors in the void (where our tanks are), it can be a shit show. Guess who was the EOOW that day.\n\nSo I come in with my guys (remember, training), waited in line to talk to him and try to coordinate. When I get to him, he starts screaming at me about how he made an 8MC announcement for all the junior GS to start on filters in the engine room and where the fuck were my guys, etc. I reminded him that just this morning at quarters, he had made it clear that we were to focus on our particular inspections and that filters were a GSM’s responsibility, not us (MC#1), so the GSEs are going to work on TLIs today. I then proceeded to run him through the maintenance we were about to do and how it could impact him....\n\nGSM1: That’s not my problem. That’s a GSE problem.  \n\nMe: Well yes, it’s our maintenance but the alarms....  \n\nGSM1: GSE problem. If it’s a GSM problem, I will handle it.  \n\nMe: Okay. Is anyone scheduled to go in the void today?  \n\nGSM1: That’s for me to worry about.  \n\nMe: ....okay. I’m going to grab a radio so that...  \n\nGSM1: You’re not standing watch. Only watch-standers get radios.  \n\nMe: Yeah but for this maintenance...  \n\nGSM1: Does it say on your maintenance card that you need a radio?  \n\nMe: No, but...  \n\nGSM1: Then you don’t need a radio. You do exactly what the maintenance card says. Do you need tagouts?  \n\nMe: No, but the alarms...  \n\nGSM1: If you don’t need tagouts, stay out of Central.\n\nSo he will handle GSM problems, we don’t get radios, follow the maintenance card exactly and stay out of Central if we don’t need tagouts. MC #2, 3, 4 and 5. Also, absolutely NO ONE in CCS, including Chief and the inspectors, said a damned thing the whole time.\n\nI print out a maintenance card for the 4 of us, with a list of TLIs to do. This is not the norm, but I was doing it on purpose knowing it will make things worse for him. We followed the cards EXACTLY. Nothing in the card says to notify Central. Usually we would have radios and tell Central exactly which tank alarm they are about to get. But we can’t, so GSM1 gets 4 tank alarms at once, and since he didn’t bother listening to me, and there was nothing in the EOSS about tank alarms, he had no idea what to do. Also, the GSMs were rushing filters that morning so that they can shut off everything so that the contractors can go in. Mind you, he had INSURV inspectors in Central with him the while time watching him. It wasn’t until I was on my 4th TLI that he figured out what was going on and started yelling for me over the 8MC.\n\nWell my maintenance card doesn’t say to stop and this is sensitive equipment that I can’t just leave lying open, so I take my time finishing up. My guys swing by to ask me what they should do and I tell them to “do what GSM1 said, follow the maintenance card and meet me OUTSIDE Central.” I finished up, went to Central and stood outside the doorway. GSM1 starts screaming at me about setting off alarms without telling him, messing up “his plant,” and that I need to fix this right now because the tank contractors refuse to go in until alarms are resolved. Oh, something about Mast too, because insubordination or some shit. I reminded him that he had refused to give us radios so I couldn’t have notified him, refused to let me tell him about the maintenance because it’s a “GSE problem,” that I was not to enter Central unless I needed tagouts (see, I’m outside!), and that the tank contractors were a “GSM problem.”\n\nMe: I was following all the orders you gave me, GSM1.  \n\nFinally, FINALLY, Chief speaks up: She’s right, you know. She was following your orders exactly.\n\nGSM1 turns bright red, mouth opening and closing, making some very concerning noises, staring at Chief. Chief stares back for a very long minute, then walks out, grabbing me and the other GSEs and marched us all to the nearest engineroom. As soon as we’re inside, he starts laughing so hard he was curled up on the floor.\n\nTo cut a long story short, Chief told me I was an asshole, to never let that happen again and that from now on, I was to report to and listen to him, and only him (MC#6 for the rest of that inspection period). GSM1 had to redo his EOOW qualifications per the inspectors and was given extended training on communication etiquette. He was also not allowed to use any of my guys anymore so the GSMs work doubled and I had extra time to train my guys.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

        "text": " Nurse on an inpatient unit here. We often get patients who are more than capable of doing certain things for themselves but will demand the nursing staff do it for them anyway (i.e. free slaves/maids/back-scratchers). Of course, patients who have limited mobility need assistance. But I'm talking about patients who have had totally unrelated diagnoses or surgeries, and now their hands/feet *SOMEHOW* don't work anymore. \n\nThere was a patient in her 50s who had abdominal surgery (removal of part of colon) and asked me to feed her dinner. I will gladly help this patient get out of bed or even put on her socks, because these would require the abdominal muscles and therefore be difficult for her. There's nothing wrong with her hands; and if I feed her, it actually impedes her healing and returning to independence. This patient also has a reputation for being demanding and unnecessarily needy. \n\nM is me and P is patient. So after she asks me to feed her: \n\n**M:** Oh, are you not able to feed yourself?\n\n**P:** No. \n\n**M:** What's wrong, is there something wrong with your hands?\n\n**P:** I'm just feeling weak, so if you could feed me. \n\n**M:** Oh OK, I'm just going to do an assessment.\n\nI go into a full neurological/musculoskeletal assessment and checks her circulation/muscle tone/strength/etc for each hand and finger. She's getting impatient because of course she just wants me to feed her like she's my baby in a high chair. But good news: she's passing every test with flying colors! \n\n**M:** Hhmm, if you're not able to feed yourself, there may be something new and wrong with your that hands we should be concerned about. I'm going to page the doctor to come and do an assessment. \n\n**P:** But can you help me eat? \n\n**M:** I understand, but I'm concerned about this. I'll let you know what the doctor says. \n\nI didn't actually page the doctor. I go back in 10 minutes and she's finished eating the food herself! I pretend to not notice the empty tray. \n\n**M:** So I paged the doctor and I'll wait for him to decide what to do. If he's concerned, he might want to order an X-ray. \n\n**P:** But it's night time now.\n\n**M:** Yep, X-rays can be done overnight. The ER X-Ray is open 24 hours. \n\nThis was the overnight shift. I made sure to round on her at least every hour to perform the full re-assessment of her hands. Around midnight, she finally tells me that her hands feel better now. I'm super happy to hear that!\n\n**M:** That's good to hear, let me know if you're experiencing any more weakness or trouble with your hands again! \n\nYes I did technically lie and told my patient I paged the doctor when I didn't. But I saw through her right away, and I was not going to waste another healthcare professional's time to assess her inability to hold a spoon. Lesson: do not (purposely) report false information to your provider because you are wasting their time and also impeding your healing progress. ",

        "text": "My dad is a difficult person. I love him to bits and this isn't like a deep insult, but he's one of those people who's just like... Pathologically difficult. Can't make a decision, can't let other people make decisions without intervening, that kind of thing. The grass is always greener, there's always another option that we're missing, etc. If we can, my family and I will make as many choices without him as we fairly can, cos he's literally just so hard to negotiate.\n\n\nAnother thing about my dad is that he doesn't like to be wrong, or to have other people disagree with him. He's very stubborn about his opinions. Again, I'm not really criticising, in fact I'm exactly the same. \n\n\nYou can probably tell that this is a lethal combination. I could fill a book with stories that belong on r/maliciouscompliance and r/pettyrevenge with stories where my dad's personality has had hilarious consequences. \n\n\nSo, tonight. We've been redecorating our house so it's all upside down and everyone is busy. It gets to dinnertime and nobody has put any thought into what we'll eat. We decided that cooking is overrated and we'd get takeout instead. \n\n\nBut of course, this brings us to the question of what we'll eat, and where we'll buy it from. Dad wants an Indian. Me, my mum and my siblings unanimously want good ol', deep fried, unhealthy as shit, burger and fries. Theres a food joint by our house that serves both Indian food AND burgers, so that one's the perfect option, right? In two minutes everyone has settled on that choice. \n\n\nEveryone, of course, except for my dad. He thinks this other takeaway we know of does NICER Indian food for CHEAPER and just OVERALL BETTER. But father, you hear us cry, what about everyone else? You're the only one who wants Indian food!!\n\n\nThe debate ensues. I know it sounds so petty, but this is honestly what he's like with everything. No matter how trivial or petty, everything is debate material. In he launches, to a deep cost-benefit analysis between Takeout One and Takeout Two. \n\n\nUsually I love to engage him and see how much I can wind him up. But this time, we're all exhausted. We're all sat around, been decorating for hours, we just wanna sit in the quiet and eat our damn burgers. Nobody really rises to the debate, which irritates my dad. He lives for the debate. \n\n\nSo, my dearest mature father, folds his arms, scowls and says the magic words. \"Fine, order from wherever you like... But don't get me anything. I don't want it.\"\n\n\nSo that, friends, is exactly what we did. Nobody said another word, and I ordered the food online without any more discussion. Dad is still sulking and he's playing on his phone to ignore us. The actual epitome of childish. He hadn't realised that I've actually done what he said, doesn't think I'd even consider it. Everyone is sat around smirking while we wait for the penny to drop. \n\n\nProbably about 10 minutes later, Drama Queen has made his point and he's ready to engage in conversation again. \"Has anyone made any sensible decisions on dinner?\"\n\n\nI couldn't have planned the response better. In perfect synchrony, my entire family looks at him in innocent confusion. What do you mean, dad? You told us to order what we wanted, so we have!!\n\n\nThe scowl is back. \"So what did you get me?\"\n\n\nNothing, Dad!! You said you didn't want it!!\n\n\nJaw hits the floor. Shock, horror. We did what? Ordered food??? Without him?????? Even though he said he didn't want it???????????????????\n\n\nThe food arrives not long after, and we all tuck in. I sweetly offer him one of my fries while he thinks about what he's gonna buy for himself. The scowl is still there for a little while, but he knows when he's been had and he takes it like a good sport. He steal several more of my fries than he's been offered, and then orders his Indian from the place he wanted to buy from. Not before he considers 3 other ones, of course. Some things don't ever change. ",

        "text": "So I work in a hospital, an old hospital, on one of the oldest wards on the top floor. For anyone not in the UK right now, we're experiencing a heatwave like hasn't been seen for the past forty years, it's not rained for a good few months, and it's just all-round unpleasant to live in.\n\nI've been working night shifts to combat the heat, and for the past few weeks have been nursing two thirty-something year old patients I'll call Sandy and Amy.\n\nThese two haven't been too bad with me, calling me their favourite nurse when I'm on shift and other such bollocks, but they've been downright rude and aggressive to my colleagues on day shift. Security has been called more than once to de-escalate their tantrums. So I knew to be cautious around them and keep them at arm's length. A few shifts go by uneventfully, or so I thought. \n\nThe other day, we got the full run-down in handover.\n\nBoth Sandy and Amy had complained about every single staff member who'd interacted with them, from someone sitting at a desk, to one of the health care professionals \"flirting\" with male patients. The comments were vile and bitter. All completely unfounded, and literally nothing more than two women trapped in bed having nothing better to do than make up stories. We work damn hard and if we get thirty seconds to sit down, we're going to do it. And we might even have a drink at the desk to rehydrate ourselves too. HOW DARE WE, apparently. The night team, including me, were the subject of a few complaints about flirting and talking about holiday plans. Not even talking loudly, just literally **talking** about holiday plans. \n\nOne of their main complaints was how care rounds (where we document a patient's pain, position and wounds **every two hours**) had been completed without us physically asking us those questions. THEY WERE IN CONSTANT PAIN, so WHY HAD WE DOCUMENTED PAIN SCORES AS ZERO. We **obviously** needed to ask to get a truly accurate score, they said, and refused to allow us to use our clinical experience to fill in the chart. \n\nNow. If a patient is in pain, a fully independent, oriented adult patient, they can call us and tell us how much pain they're in so we can manage it with analgesia. They have call bells. They can even walk to the nurse's station if needs be. And even they're not able to vocalise their pain, e.g. if they have dementia, we can look out for telltale signs of pain, such as facial contortion, fidgeting, moaning etc. \n\nA patient saying they have 10/10 pain yet who sits there watching Jeremy Kyle while shoving chocolate raisins down their gullet probably isn't in the throes of childbirth-like agony and likewise a patient who says they're in no pain yet they have beads of sweat forming on their brow and are grinding their teeth down like a bear on a trout probably has some pain. And **someone sound asleep** likely isn't feeling pain as they are rested and relaxed enough for their body to allow them to drift into the ether. If they wake up in pain, that of course would be documented.\n\nHowever the complaint was that we hadn't documented their **actual** pain score and obviously according to them we couldn't know this actual pain score without asking them. I spoke with both of them and reiterated their concerns, I explained how we were trained in pain management etc, yet both agreed that they would like to be asked during the shift. \n\nSo, like a good HCP, from the time my shift started to the time it ended, every two hours instead of just walking by and seeing them sleeping soundly, I woke them up to ask how their pain was. Sleeping like a baby? Up you get. Just drifting off into a fitful slumber? Wake up, Sandy, it's time to document your pain score. Finally passed out despite the bothersome heat? I'll be shaking you awake there matey.\n\n**From the time my shift started** at 2000 until it ended at 0730 **every two hours on the dot** I woke them both up to accurately document their pain. Of course, they reported no pain at every wake up call. \n\nThree days of this goes by and last night before lights out Sandy tells me not to wake her during the night as with the heat, she's barely getting any sleep due to being woken up every two hours. Amy agrees. I say that unfortunately we need to accurately document pain scores and as they weren't happy with us using our professional clinical judgement to ascertain whether they were in pain or not, we would need to continue to ask. Unless, unless they were happy with us using our professional experience to note if there was any sign of pain while sleeping.\n\nYeah, turns out that's a good idea, apparently. \n\nWho knew. ",

        "text": "Back in the warehouse days we suffered a good six to eight months worth of nightmare customer pickups until management started to listen to the warehouse staff suggestions.\n\nIt took a few particularly bad instances to get management to update the terms and conditions of their sales contracts involving customer pick ups of goods, and absolving warehouse staff of any responsibility ( in theory).\n\nA few weeks after these new policies had been put into place, we received a massive stock transfer into the ware house, including a 3 seater fixed recliner for a customer pickup.\n\nNow this particular recliner had a fixed metal bracket system that allowed the customer to clip their recliner section in. Normally the reclining sections would remain seperate to the bracket so nothing would be damaged in transit.\n\nOn THIS particular order, the customer had requested at the time of purchase for his lounge to be assembled, recliner panels included before being shipped.\n\nAfter reading this, I inspected the lounge thoroughly, breathing a sigh of relief that the sofa had arrived from Italy in pristine condition.\n\nI called the customer and arranged for a 4.30pm pickup. I also mentioned as per our new policies to bring an appropriate vehicle and a 2nd person to help with lifting.\n\n4.30pm rolls around and to my surprise the customer shows up in a small truck he’s rented, with a 2nd person to help him.\n\nI greet the customer, and ask him to do an inspection of his lounge before signing off on the product before loading it up.\n\nThe customer and his friend look over the lounge, and all seems fine until they notice the recliner sections have been clipped into the bracket.\n\n Customer (to me ) - what’s this?\n\nMe - that’s the reclining section of your lounge sir\n\nCustomer ( irritated ) - why is is clipped in?\n\nMe - you requested it to be assembled when you purchased the lounge\n\nCustomer ( visibly angry ) - well how the FUCK am I meant to get it into my house?\n\nMe - do you have a tool box at home sir?\n\nCustomer - maybe\n\nMe - well I’d be happy to show you how to unclip the back section of the sofa—\n\nCustomer puts a hand up right in my face —\n\nCustomer - I’m NOT doing your job for you.\n\nMe - sir, we can remove these sections, but it’ll mean unwrapping your sofa, and having to take a screw driver to these brackets..... now I’m happy to do that but we need you to sign off on this paperwork authorising me to do so\n\nCustomer - I want to speak to the manager, you’re making this too difficult\n\nI step aside and motion towards to door leading to the sales room \n\nMe - she’s right in there\n\nThe customer and his friend storm off, leaving me to share a few flustered words with my off Siders.\n\nA few minutes pass and the customer comes striding back in with the Manager close on his heels.\n\nHe launches into this big tirade on how I’m lazy, and difficult and refusing to give him satisfactory customer service.\n\nI explain that not only does he want us to open the lounge and potentially expose it to the dust in the ware house loading dock, but he also wants me to unclip the back of the lounge from the bracket which... even with the proper tools... could scratch the metal and possibly damage the lounge.\n\nCustomer - I’ve had enough, either you make him do it or get me someone who will\n\nThe manager pulls her cell phone out and calls the GM. She explains everything, and then hands the phone to the customer.\n\nCustomer ( listening to the GM ) - if he won’t do it, I will\n\nThe manager turns to me and says that the GM wants her to “officially” ask me if I’m comfortable with volunteering to help the customer out?\nI shake my head no\n\nThe manager follows this up by saying as per the customers request I am being ordered to remove the backs of this lounge no matter what.\n\nThe customer smiles at me with this smug grin. I just say okay.\n\nWe place some drop sheets into the floor, my team opens the plastic as I begin to gingerly use the screwdriver to try and leverage the recliner clip out of the bracket. \n\nAs I’m doing this the customer announces to everyone that he will help, he comes over and grabs a handful of the recliners back cushion and yanks it up towards him.\n\nThe recliner jerks out of the bracket with such force it’s hits my elbow, making me kind of slip, which in turns causes the screwdriver to pierce the back of the lounge. The force in which the customer yanked this recliner section also causes the opposite bracket to snap off.\n\nThe customer stands there holding the now detached , snapped back cushion, and the manager is staring at the screwdriver impaled through this expensive leather sofa and embedded into the foam of the seat cushion.\n\nI turn to the manager and ask with a sought hint of sarcasm \n\nMe - you want me to start working on the other one ?\n\nNeedless to say the GM wasn’t very happy with this $10,000 “mistake”\n\n",

        "text": "FTP, sorry for any mistakes or if this doesn't fit the sub. I'll remove if so.\n\nThis happened about over a year ago on my first ever part time job as a dishwasher. I was about a month into the job and I've already found the not-so-fast-but-worth-the-extra-time way to do my job, considering the very limited space to do so. I made it a rule to make time to stack all incoming dishes neatly on one side of the sink, plates with plates, bigger ones go to the bottom of the stack, and so on. Unfortunately, the chef whose post is right next to me and sometimes help me with the dishes is very stubborn and doesn't think very far ahead, and so was the manager.\n\nThe chef always says that I'm too slow and that I don't need to be so neat about it, but I don't usually listen. This is because my hands are small, so dishes slipping out of my hands is fairly common for me and the neat stacks of dirty dishes reduces the chances of the dish that is falling, to hit a pile and break everything. I tried to counter this by using rubber gloves, but I was scolded instead, saying that it doesn't look pretty in front of the customers. I did tell him the reason, but of course, he didn't care. \n\nThis one day, he kept on stacking the dishes all over the sink, bowls under really big plates, glasses and mugs stack on top of it, etc. And I was going to tidy them, but he screamed at me telling me that we can't afford the extra time because some of those plates are very limited in number and we need them for a special menu that day, so I was told to ignore the mess and keep washing. No. Matter. What. \n\nSo I did. It was going smoothly until he went to stack more dirty dishes bumping me in the process and making the beer glass in my hands fell to the stack, breaking one of the most precious plates we have. \n\nHe was shocked and he tried to blame me for it, why didn't I put that plate somewhere safer, etc. I reminded him he was the one who specifically told me to ignore the messy stack and continued washing. He got even more pissed and the manager heard all of this. The manager did give me some scolding, and some talk about how my monthly salary wouldn't even begin to cover for the plate that we lost today, but thankfully, another chef that was always kind to me and who saw the whole thing, backed my story and told the manager that it wasn't my fault. \n\nThe manager and the stubborn chef didn't like it, of course. But they couldn't do anything either since the other chef backed me up. (Note that this is in Japan and keeping up appearances and making sure that your workers respect you is very important for the bosses/higher ups.) After that, I was **told** to always tidy up the stack. \n\nTLDR: Stubborn chef told me to not tidy up the messy, dangerous stack of dirty dishes and to **only** wash them. I did, and he ended up causing one of the most precious plates we have to break, while trying to blame me for not tidying up the stack. Another chef sided with me and I didn't get in trouble.",

        "text": "So I recently started working in this small corporate services office. It's pretty standard boring office work: data entry, filing, etc. The office is 8 young-middle aged female workers and myself, a 28 year old male. I also happen to be the most \"computer literate\" by far (boss even introduced me as a \"computer guy\"), and as such I get asked by my coworkers to help out with random computer things occasionally. Most of my coworkers are OK, but the office manager is a real piece of work. Shes this 60 year old witch of a woman that has control issues the likes of which iv never seen before. I just try to avoid her. \n\nAnyway cut to about 3 weeks after I started working there, and one of the girls asks me for help because \"her email isn't working.\" I try to fix her problem (she didn't like how the mail was being displayed) and long story short I'm not able to fix the problem right away. It kinda bugged me because i felt like i still needed to prove myself to the office, so i kept working on it on my own and eventually figured out which setting was causing the problem. when i go back over there the office manager has been called to deal with \"the bug.\" And, of course, it has now become my fault because i played with the settings. Whats worse is even when i explain the fix to her she wont let me touch the computer because ill mess it up more. I ended having to walk another employee through the settings until she got it, which even then i still didn't get credit for it. The office manager gives me a real harsh telling off about messing around with computers telling me when there's a computer issue I should \"Let the IT guy handle it.\" (Side Note: The IT guy is a part time employee who comes in twice a week, waiting on most of the stupid stuff I deal with would be moronic.) When I start giving this woman the cold shoulder she complains to the boss that I need to respect her more. Needless to say I'm pretty pissed at this point and I cant even show it.\n\nA week goes by and things seem to be reverting back normal. However, in the middle of a routine call, all of a sudden I hear the office manager give a small scream. She starts freaking out saying that she \"flipped the computer over.\" Confused I peak over the cubical wall and see that she had just accidentally made her display portrait (ctrl+alt+right arrow) However she doesn't know how minor of an issue it is and thinks she broke something. With a note of panic in her voice she calls me over and asks if i know whats going on. I gave her a very grim look, brushed my hair back and said \"I don't know, I'v never seen anything like this. I think maybe I should let IT handle it.\" \n\nIT came in the next day and laughed at how scared she was; I kinda suspect that when he told her how minor of an issue it was she knew i had played her.",

When I started we printed our newspaper and our competitions. I don't know why. Through a series of employees being hired and quitting I was eventually left in charge even though I was the least experienced. The bothered the hell out of my boss because she never liked me even though she hired me. Now onto the MC.\n\nWe started printing the paper of a sister company that was a couple hours away. So we couldn't do any of the editing or fix anything without some real work because they'd send us the files and leave work. There came a week where my boss was gone and the sister paper has messed up an ad leaving it black while it should be color. This is bad because all papers make money off of ads. They didn't understand our press setup and what we could do. So I emailed the boss and she told me they were the experts and do what they sent. So I did and it was wrong. But they never complained to us. So every night I emailed the boss from my personal email to get confirmation to print what they sent. And I always had it in writing. So every night it messed up.\n\nWhen the boss got back a week later she was furious. I tried to explain it to her but she wouldn't listen about anything. When she asked me why I said they were the experts and I was following directions.\n\nShe ended up being fired for a lot of things and I left when I was injured.

        "text": "Hello again fellow MC!\n\nThis is another tale of your preferred Fire Alarm Technician, u/Tenebralupo. In this tale, our MC happened last week in the northernmost territory, Nunavut (fyi in Inuktitut it means Our Land)\n\n#the cast\n\n$ME: yours faithful Fire Alarm Technician specialized in codes and norms from his native province, Québec. Also very adamant about COMPLYING with the CODES AND NORMS ENFORCED IN THE AREA HE'S WORKING.\n\n$C: Client and pilot, from Quebec\n\n$QE: oldest electrician of the group, from Québec.\n\n$NE: youngest electrician of the group, she's our local worker (always hire a local so Inuits are friendly with you and don't see you as job stealer)\n\n$CP: co-pilot and journeyman, from Quebec\n\n$IE: idiotic engineer, he's representing his employer from province of Alberta.\n\n#the backstory\n\nIn Canada, every provinces/territories may use Federal Codes&amp;Norms as is (like New Brunswick) , OR may modify it in a more stricter way (example, federal max dBa for Evac is 110dBa in Quebec it's 95 dBa) OR reject and vote for a different book of Codes&amp;Norms (I'm looking at you PEI with your NFPA). Which means, we need to comply with the actual codes&amp;norms, therefore I followed my duties and looked for whatever norms I had to deal in Nunavut.\n\n#Story\n\nWithout skipping the whole week to the MC, I will still make it quick. \n\n**Day #1**\n\nMonday 6:30am, after 2ish hours of driving I reach the airport where $C own a hangar for his plane. 8am it's a GO we reach our destination at 4PM (local time. Total fly was 10hours)\n\n**Day #2** \n\nTuesday had been spent for programming my brand new fire alarm panel while $QE and $NE rush at completing the job.\n\n**Day #3**\n\nTroubles. Troubles everywhere. We spend the day troubleshooting and testing the devices. Midday, we recieve an e-mail from $IE demanding we do the most archaic test ever (remove the main power for 24hours and, while it's still on backup batteries, activate the alarm for AT LEAST 30 MINUTES NON-STOP)\n\n**Day #4**\n\n$IE's flight is delayed. He won't show up before supper. We continue our job at troubleshooting every mistakes both electricians made (didn't input the right address, crushed the wires, accidentally cut the wires, etc). We finished most of the test and we go for supper.\n\n$C: the engineer is finally here. $NE would you like to show the work to him? Also, $ME, since you know better than anyone here your panel, would you mind if you go there with her?\n\n$ME: sure! No problem! I'll just walk a bit before to digest first then I'll head there.\n\n*Half an hour later*\n\nI show up at the worksite looking for $NE and instead I encounter a weirdo white guy in running shoes, jeans, Motley Crue t-shirt and a very colorful eye-catching... Mohawk\n\n$him: HEY! YOUR PULL STATIONS ARE TOO HIGH!\n\n*After a couple of minutes realising this guy is the actual engineer*\n\n$ME: I'm sorry... What?\n\n$IE: the pull stations. They. Are. Too. High!\n\n$ME: Woah. Woah. Woah. Woah! Minute papillon! What the hell are you talking about? They are perfectly fine!\n\n$IE: NO! THEY AREN'T! THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BETWEEN 1050 (millimeters, about 41 inches and a third)  AND 1150 (millimeters, about 45 and a quarter) THEY ARE TOO HIGH, MAN!\n\n$ME: What norms are you talking about?\n\n$IE: 2015...\n\n$ME: I'm sorry but that's not the edition of the code that is enforced here!\n\n$IE: it is in Northwest territories.\n\n$ME: dude... Where in Nunavut. Not NWT!\n\n$IE: they are still too high! I am pretty sure it's the same height for older codes for people on wheelchairs!\n\n*Pull out his laptop and open the PDF of the 2010 edition of the code* $ME: see right there? It's between 1200 millimeters (47 inches and about a quarter) and 1400 millimeters (55 inches and about a tenth) . Not 1050 and 1150 as you thought it was.\n\n$IE *starting to get mad*: I'll come back about this tomorrow.\n\n$ME *with a smile*: no problem! Have you any questions regarding the system?\n\n$IE: yeah. Where's the EOL? \n\n$ME: ahem... EOL? Sorry but my system is fully addressed. Every single devices, including the horns/strobes are addressed and therefore an EOL is useless. Have you ever worked with Simplex's new line of systems?\n\n$IE: ............ No? Have you done the ground fault test as requested by the CAN/ULC-S537?\n\n$ME: which edition you referring?\n\n$IE: 2014! Why?\n\n$ME: again, this edition is not enforced here\n\n$IE *getting more and more furious*: have you done the test?!?!\n\n$ME: yes I did. There was so many Ground faults I know it's worked and we fixed them.\n\n$IE: have you done the test on every single devices?\n\n$ME: not required as per the code.\n\n$IE: we'll talk about it tomorrow.\n\n$ME: no problem! Have a nice evening!\n\nI came back to the \"hotel\" after another good walk. I recall the encounter to the crew, and everyone relax to hear I am on their side and will gladly take the challenge with the engineers.\n\n**Day #5**\n\nFirst things first, we all sat down (minus $IE) discussing about what to do with this guy.\n\n$C: the hell we do with that?\n\n$ME: to make it short, here's (while shooting an e-mail to $C) a link showing which province and territory adopted the 2015 AND 2010 editions of the Codes&amp;Norms. Also, here's a public notice from Government of Nunavut stating they may adopt the 2015 later this year.\n\n$C: alright thanks $ME. You really save us a week worth of work with this.\n\n$ME: no problem! It's a pleasure to comply to whatever is actually enforced. I still can't believe how they screwed up and hadn't looked at this first.\n\n$CP: what do you mean?\n\n$ME: well basically I knew I was going to Nunavut. So first things I did was checking whichever norms&amp;codes are enforced. When I realized they use the same edition as in Quebec I was glad to not look for a different book. I don't understand why they haven't done that. Plus the guy is trying to tell me how to do my job!\n\n$CP: seriously? Wow!\n\nAfter we all disperse to our different duties, a couple of  hours later, $IE shows up.\n\n$IE: so when will you do the Ground fault on every devices?\n\n$ME *in his head*: is it too difficult to start a conversation with \"Good morning!\"???\n\n$ME:  did you actually read the norm? I have the 2014 edition and it is as reference because it is not yet enforced so as YOUR EDITION SAYS 4.3.1.3.B) 1 Ground Fault at the FURTHEST device only. Not every single devices as you claims. Go and read it if you don't believe me. And yet again, the 2004 edition mention the same thing.\n\n$IE *dumbfounded*: but... But... Did you create a trouble with every devices?\n\n$ME: I had to. There was so many Ground fault, short circuit and open circuit, we needed to look for them everywhere.\n\n$IE *aggressively*: did you done that to the horn/strobes too?\n\n$ME: not yet I haven't finished my job yet\n\n#aftermath\n\nAnd after this encounter he avoided me at all costs. He did everything he could to dodge me, not talk to me, and not look in my direction.\n\nFor those who wonders where the MC is. Well my job is to COMPLY to codes and norms enforced and I maliciously shoved the actual codes and norms up their butt to those idiotic engineers (the other one didn't flew there, we were in a conference call with the senior engineer)\n\nEdit: formatting and few typos",

        "text": "Super short malicious compliance. FTP, LTL. Let me know if I've broken some rule. \n\nRecently, I volunteered to teach origami to a small group of kids at an event. I figured folding paper cranes would be a good task for beginners, so I went to the library beforehand to print off instructions. While I was there, I thought it would be best to make an example crane, so they can see the end result before they start.\n\nI walk up to the front desk of the library to talk to the employee, (LE for library employee), thinking I should ask for paper just in case they don't want me messing with the printers. There were signs saying specifically to ask someone for help, so I was hoping someone could get some for me, or give me permission.\n\nMe: \"Hey, could I use some paper from the printer for origami?\"\n\nLE: \"Sorry, no, we don't allow that actually. You can go look in the recycling bins next to the printers, though, since it gets disposed of anyway.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, thanks. I'll check there.\"\n\nOkay, fine. It's an understandable policy. They don't want the clean paper to be unnecessarily used. Still, I rolled my eyes, cause I didn't want to have an example crane with text all over it. But then I think to myself, there are usually blank pieces next to the printer, or in the scrap. I'll just find the cleanest piece I can.\n\nLE watched me walk over to the printer to make sure I didn't go after the clean paper anyway, and that made it all the better when I pull two perfectly clean pieces of printer paper right from the top of the scrap pile. When I look over at her, she has her hand over her mouth, quietly laughing! I guess she thought it was a dumb rule too.\n\nTLDR: I can't get paper from the printer. I find clean paper in the scrap pile anyway.",

I had worked here for a solid 18 months, nearly 2 years fresh out of university. We had super high staff turnover, so I was one of the most experienced bar staff there. \n\nFor context we had three managers (live in landlords, husband, wife, and their son) and two supervisors, I was one, the other I will refer to as RS (Rule stickler) \n\nWith some context that we were busy, we had a great understanding as a team. If you’ve got two minutes to kill while people have come back off their break and they can cover you for two minutes, by all means go and do your thing man. Our unwritten rule amongst staff was pretty much to do what needed to be done; if there’s tables to be cleared, or take the bins out, or general tidying, crack on mate, we might not get a chance to do this stuff for a long long time. \n\nThis bar was pretty long (about 20 feet long) as so there were 4 tills, and we all loosely had sections that we kept to, so as to keep the bar pretty well covered. One day out of nowhere, the manager posts a notice on the wall stating that you absolutely have to keep to your section, no matter what, under no circumstances, etc. \n\nI mean ok that’s fine, I’m usually down the end of the bar, which is a dead and, I’m pinned down most of the evening anyway, so I rarely get a chance to do much else besides serve, but when I do get a chance to reset by tidying, stocking up and what not I’ll do a solid job and then get back to serving. In fact we all did this pretty efficiently as part of our unwritten rule. \n\nOne day, about 4pm, were relatively busy, it’s steady but it’s not busy, I’ve got three customers to serve. \nFirst customer gets served no problem. Second customer, I drop their glass all over the floor (ahhh shit) I’d best get someone to serve these two guys while I clean up my broken glass. Enter RS (rule stickler) She’s never been the brightest and has zero common sense. \n\nMe: Can someone do me a solid and serve these to guys while I sweep this up please?\n\nRS: Have you not seen the rules? I can’t go down there, it’s not my section. \n\nMe: Ok fine. You sweep this up, while I serve them then?\n\nRS: Nope, same rule applies. \n\nMe: Are you for real? You’re actually stood there twiddling your thumbs. (I’m stood there thinking “just allow it” but obviously don’t actually say it)\n\nRS: Nothing I can do\n\nSo there I go, I serve these guys, and the other three or four customers that come up, all the while while I’m treading in broken glass. \n\n10 minutes pass, and I finally get a chance to go and get a brush\n\nHere’s when I saw I opportunity for some delightful malicious compliance for the rest of the night.  You can’t use some common sense? You all bet your ass I’m gonna be a pain in the ass all day, I live for this shit. \n\nSo there I went, I didn’t leave my 4 feet serving area for the remaining 10 hours of my shift. \n\n-There’s a tonne of glasses down this end of the bar? Sorry I can’t take them down, the glass wash takes me down the forbidden end of the bar. \n\n-The bottle bin (a skip that we put empty bottles in) is over flowing and needs to be emptied? Too bad no body else can lift it up to take it out, but that’s out of my domain soz. \n\n-Customer wants a particular spirit? That’s a tough one, our only bottle is kept on section two my love, you’ll have to scoot over 3 feet. \n\n-That customer a foot to your right was served before you? Too bad pal, new policy, not my section, give us a call first thing tomorrow and the manager will answer. \n\n-I’m out of specific branded pint glasses for your high end lager that normally comes in a fancy stemmed glass? Eeesh, I mean there’s some over there but that’s a de-militarised zone dude, but here’s a piping hot Guinness glass, lap that shit up. Best be quick, in two minutes flat that’ll be more dead than my sex life. \n\nFast forward to the end of the night, and the bar is an absolute shit state, mess everywhere, everyone’s section not just my own. It wasn’t a particularly busy night by our normal standards, and this mess was attributed solely to this new policy. Usually we’d have all pitched in and just cracked on with doing what needed to be done. \n\nThe managers’ tirade continued with a few other things, but those are stories for another day. I handed in my notice a few weeks later, and and landed a sick job doing something actually related to my degree (happy days) \n\nI’d like to say that while I recognise RS was simply sticking to the new policy, she very clearly took it incredibly literally, to the point where you can’t budge an inch out of your section. The rule pretty much meant that you shouldn’t serve anyone outside of your section (which we all pretty much did anyway).\n\nTL;DR Not my section, not my problem/Dim problem.\n\nEDIT: Shitty typos, grammar, formatting etc (like I said\nI’m on mobile and it’s 12.30am in the UK)\n\nEDIT 2: Added a few more examples of that delicious MC. \n\nEDIT 3: Added a TL;DR not sure how I forgot one.",

        "text": "Not 100% sure this fits the sub, but I'll throw myself on your mercy. The folks over at prorevenge said it fits better here. \n\nMy dad is special. \n\nIf you peruse my post history you'll notice that he and I don't see eye to eye anymore and that he maybe probably most definitely has narcissistic personality disorder and was/is rather hard to live with. At times he is a nuclear level asshole. But my dad is also my hero because I love him and always will. His life history seems to have fallen out 50-50, good and bad. He's done some mean, moronic, bone stupid and awful stuff in his life, but when he did good, he did *really* good.\n\nMy dad is a Vietnam vet. Like most vets he came home and was promptly treated like the maggot-ridden mouse the cat dragged in. The concept of veteran support was slightly better in the 70s than, say, the 1940s, but only slightly. Plus there was some stuff the Air Force decided didn't happen, so Dad couldn't talk about that at all. Dad basically drowned PTSD and memories of Danang under approximately all the alcohol. This tanked his first marrige and left him in the position of having to either dry out and face his ghosts or die. \n\nEventually, he dried out, and like most recovering addicts he became an evangelist for sobriety. Dad made his living as a salesman, and felt better selling sobriety to drunks than he did selling diamonds or eye glasses or paper. And he was good at it. Which is how he landed in a group home for teenage boys in the French Quarter of New Orleans back in the 80s. \n\nAgain, my dad has issues. At times he can be a selfish bastard and at his absolute best, he's doing things for his own benefit first. But I am not exaggerating when I say that he saved the lives of a lot of these kids. These were kids who came home from school and discovered that their whole family had moved away without him. These were kids who thought the other kids were lying when they said Milk comes from cows, because they had seen with their own eyes that milk comes from *the store*. My dad's job was to keep them from killing each other, keep them sober, and try to teach them some kind of life skill because as soon as they turned 18, they got a bus ticket to the city of their choice and couldn't contact anyone from their group home for several years. The kid who told me this story was one of several who hunted my dad down as soon as it was legal to let the only father figure they'd ever had know that they were okay. Dad is currently in the hospital out of state, and no less than two of his former foster kids are with him because he is, and always will be, their dad. He fucked up by the numbers, alright, but he also did good by a lot of these kids.\n\nBut it wasn't easy. Sometimes the kids needed a lesson and consequences. And there's a whole list of things you can't do to kids in foster care, especially a highly supervised setting like a group home. You can't spank or restrict food. Confinement is out. Chores are reasonable but only up to a point. And you've got this whole behavioral pattern called \"negative attention seeking\" that basically meant most of the kids *wanted* to be yelled at and punished, because being yelled at and punished was the only kind of attention they ever got. It was familiar and safe, to these kids, to be beaten, sent to bed without supper, and be yelled at in the morning for good measure. These kids couldn't understand why the house parents didn't do that. They kept trying to force somebody, anybody, in authority to do the kind of violent bullshit they expected from parents. So whatever consequences you used couldn't feed into that cycle. It made working with these kids a challenge. \n\nOne area that nobody could seem to fix was Family Night. Every Wednesday the group home was supposed to take their battered collection of kiddos out to do something fun and normal. Bond with them. Give them a chance to see that normal and safe is kind of the opposite of having an abusive parent, and that love means something other than getting hit. It's a great theory. But putting it into practice meant getting ten plus teenagers to all agree on the same thing: \"Where do you want to go tonight?\"\n\nAnd the battle would start. The movies. The arcade. The mall. The roller-rink. No, I want the movies. I want the mall. We did the mall last week. On and on, moving into fist fight territory. And nothing gets on Dad's nerves like stupid, pointless, ballsy, immature bickering. He wanted to teach these kids a lesson and get them to knock that shit off...but most of the parental go-to tools just...don't work on these kids. \n\nWhich meant it was time for Dad to get creative. \n\nNow, my dad tried most of my life to get a hobby. He tried dozens but none of them stuck. My mother thinks it's because he tried too many at once. I think it's because his real hobby is fucking with people. My dad is never as happy as he is when somebody gives him an opening to con them. He once took my brother for twenty bucks on a trick pool shot, and he won by walking the cue ball around the obstacles. He once spent two hours feeding the pair of us utter bullshit and only broke character when he told us he had made it all up. He lives to fuck with you. He will try to be benevolent and bring you in on the joke so you have some fun too, but his goal is still fucking with you. \n\n And dad figured out real quick that he didn't have to *punish* these kids, he just had to make their lives miserable. Do what Dad wants, have a good time. Dont do what he wants, twist in the wind. He just had to do it in a way that didn't violate the program's framework. \n\nSo one day he's checking the movie times while the kids are fighting over where they're gonna go, and he sees it. The answer to the problem. The most beautiful solution his devious, brilliant, self absorbed mind could conceive of. So he tells the kids he will put up with the battle tonight, but they needed to pick their weekly activity out before next Wednesday, or *he* was gonna do it. \n\nPicture a dozen-plus juvenile boys, most of whom have very poor respect for authority, looking back at a kinda scraggly quasi-hippy who is overly fond of ponchos. This is the guy who planted a container garden to show them that eggplants don't produce eggs, who spends a lot of time talking about twelve steps and Jesus. When he wants to, Dad does \"harmless puppy\" very, very well. Picture them looking at him like *what's the worst you can do, old man?*\n\nDad folded up the newspaper and let them fight. The lesson would go best if they didn't take him seriously. \n\nWednesday comes around, and they haven't picked an activity. This is now, after all, an authoritative battleground. This is a supervised group home. Dad can't make them go shovel shit, if he tells them to sit and do homework they can just say they won't. Being put on restriction, they've done that before. There is no way my Dad could *make* these kids decide on a fun group activity a week in advance. They now had a place to fly their defiance flag high and prove they were bigger and harder and badder than my dad. And they could do it by not agreeing to have fun. No sir. We will not agree. No fun will be had. Fuck the man. \n\nThe kid who told me this story was in his late twenties, early thirties. He had just gotten out of the navy and there were at least fifteen years between him and that home in New Orleans. And I could *still* hear the horror and awe in his voice when he told me what my father did next.\n\nHe folded the newspaper and said, \"Alright. My pick.\"\n\nAnd then this die hard pro-capitalism Republican veteran took a dozen teenage boys to the local communist club's student documentary on the starving children of Nicaragua. \n\nThe kid who told me this story said that he finally broke when an old Korean war vet stood up, shook his fist at the screen and shouted \"God Bless Ronald Regan,\" halfway through the film. \n\nWhen it was done, Dad took them home because that was the group activity, as promised, and they didn't get another one until next week. \n\nNext Wednesday, Dad asked, \"So what are we doing tonight?\"\n\nOddly enough, they already had a movie picked out. \n\nTL:DR don't let my dad settle your arguements. Because he will. ",

The only other entrance was around back and up two and a half flights of rickety steps to an old deck that opened into a bedroom. \n\nUpstairs.  She's in a wheelchair.\n\nCommon sense says take her in the front door, up three stairs and she's home on the level she lives on.\n\nMedicaid says take her up the outside stairs, dump her in the bedroom upstairs and let her worry about getting down to the living room level.\n\nWe ignored their policy and took her in the front door anyway.\n\nA random inspection by a random inspector showed that we were not in compliance.\n\nWe appealed, the inspector came out and saw the different options and decided that we had no case for appeal.  Take her up the outside stairs.\n\nNope.  From then on, when the driver arrived at her house, he would get her out of the van in the sidewalk, and then get on the radio and tell the boss to shove his stupid job.\n\nNow that he was no longer an employee, he was free to assist this lovely person into her front door and up the stairs.\n\nOnce finished, they would come back to the van, tell the boss they'd reconsidered, and ask for their job back.\n\nBoss was ALWAYS understanding and took them back, but very carefully noted the 10 to 15 minute break in their employment, to show that the company remained in compliance.\n\nAftermath:  We had contests to see who could have the most dramatic \"I quit\" scene.\n\nMedicaid noted our activities, but couldn't put a handle on how to stop it.\n\nMalicious Compliance achieved!!",

        "text": "So this happened about two hours ago.\n\nSome background: I drive a Prius C, the small hatchback that looks like a Yaris. Anything but fancy, only 95 horsepower, but it works great for me. And of course, Prius drivers have that reputation for being slow as hell.\n\nThere's a back road I like to take occasionally. It's in a beautiful area, and can be smoother than the freeway, very few people take it, so I often don't see anyone else, and I can get great mileage due to the lower speed limit too (this is important). I usually just coast along with some windows down to enjoy the nice weather.\n\nToday I decided that I would just take it out of boredom, and the fact I wasn't in a rush to get home. So I was just coasting along doing about 35, which is about the limit for being able to just use the electric motor on a flat road. I had the windows down in the twilight, and there was no one behind me, so I was just enjoying the drive.\n\nAll of a sudden, a guy in a giant Ram truck came up behind me, and just started riding my ass. The road is pretty windy, so he couldn't safely just pass me, so he immediately started flashing his high beams and honking at me. I hate people like this, and I'm not going to give in to someone being obnoxious like that.\n\nAfter about a minute, I heard him yell out, \"Do the fucking speed limit, asshole!\"\n\nOk then, so I did.\n\nI put my car into engine-breaking, took my foot off the gas pedal and coasted down to 25 mph, the actual white sign posted speed limit on the winding section of the road.\n\nHappy now asshole?\n\nEdit: As I commented below:\n\n&gt;One lane road, no shoulder, winding like crazy, tons of blind corners, no way for him to safely pass. I did pull over when the next turn out came up and let him pass, after only a minute of him following me at the speed limit. He honked and yelled out I was a \"fucking pussy\" when he passed.",

        "text": "There are some fairly serious laws regarding concrete waste, especially the water used to wash down after a job.  As a result, contractors are generally required to provide some kind of container for the mixer trucks to clean their chutes into.  This can range from something as simple as a wheelbarrow all the way to purpose-built pits and steel containers.  Because they are the ones paying for them, some contractors get downright proprietary about people using their washouts.  They are very rarely labelled, nor to they ever bother to tell the drivers until they are in the process of washing down.  \n  \nThere is a contractor we work with on tilt-ups (large concrete warehouses, where you pour the walls flat on the slab, then [lift them into place with a crane](https://www.wconline.com/ext/resources/issues/2017/August/WC0817-FT5-Tilt-up_Walls-p1FT.jpg)).  Pours for the slab and walls are high volume, going anywhere from 500 to 1,200 cubic yards.  As a result, they build their own washouts (plywood boxes, lined with 10 mil plastic sheeting).  Normally there is no issue with using them, since they are the GC, and all work with the subcontractors is for their site.  Every so often, however, you end up on a site where the super is an absolute bastard about it.  \n  \nTwo of our drivers, Sue and Les, were on the last two loads for a [curb machine](https://youtu.be/N7Fl0g64Y8s).  It's a big, tracked machine that takes extremely dry concrete in one side, and squeezes a fully formed curb out the back like Satan's Play-Doh extruder.  Because the concrete is so dry and the work so slow, it completely messes up the insides of the drums; once the job is done, all the driver cares about is getting water on those fins and washing as much of that crap off as possible.  Sue finishes first, and, like the drivers before her, washes out in one of these wood washouts.  About the time she finishes up, Les arrives to do the same.  It is at this point that the ~~super~~ bastard shows up.  \n  \nSue has just gotten into her truck at the far washout.  She's a slight woman in her late-middle age that looks something like your favorite aunt.  Sue is something of a den-mother to the rest of the plant; everybody loves Sue.  Les is just starting to wash down at the near washout.  He's six and a half feet tall, hasn't seen 25 stone since before I started driving and looks like he might just tie your legs in a knot, once he remembers the difference between granny and square.  Three guesses which one the bastard goes after.  \n  \nHe walks around Les' truck to confront Sue, and starts yelling at her for using his washout.  Sue points out that nobody had told them the washout was not for subcontractor use, nor had anyone said anything to any of the other drivers on the job (which had been going for hours).  He doesn't care.  He points behind her truck and says, \"Let me make this simple.  You only use that washout when you are working directly for me.  Is that too hard to understand?\"  Then he asks if she's already washed out into his bin, which he can clearly see she has.  When she confirms this, he starts swearing at her, calling her names and threatening to file a complaint with corporate.  To her credit, Sue doesn't respond, and, thankfully for the bastard, Les (who was still washing out, unmolested, right behind him) is an absolute teddy bear (who just happens to look like a statue of King Hippo that was carved out of ebony by Rob Liefeld).  \n  \nSo they head back to the plant and find out from Bob, the manager, that the guy actually did call corporate to complain.  Nothing came of it, but it pisses the rest of us off all the more so, as the story spreas throughout the plant.  Sue is willing to let things go.  She's no pushover, but she has been in the business long enough not to care that some kid got his panties in a twist.  The thing is, though, den-mothers have dens, and just because Mama Bear is willing to let things slide doesn't mean you haven't bought yourself a whole den's worth of malicious compliance.  \n  \nThey didn't realize it at first, because they weren't doing anything super big, but everyone who went onto that site made a point of only using the far washout; after all, that was what we had been told to do.  It was a minor thing, but it meant that instead of detailing a crew to break up and rebuilt the washouts once they both filled, they had to send them out more often because one was regularly overflowing.  It was simple and petty for a couple weeks.  Then we got scheduled for over 1,000 yards of paving.  \n  \nPaving jobs go in the middle of the night, so there are no issues with traffic, and the trucks show up at a steady rate.  They also move at high speed, emptying out a truck in a couple minutes.  We slam that far washout.  They had built a couple more to help with the expected volume of trucks, but the only time someone touches the other washouts is when there are already three or four trucks on our designated one; after all, we had been told explicitly to only use it.  Water is getting everywhere, as it does normally, but it is all concentrated around the one washout, and that area is getting churned up into a sticky bog of sucking mud, and we are starting to track it out onto the street.\n  \nUsually, washouts are partially filled up, then dry out overnight before being used again; by the time they get full, much of the material inside them has hardened.  That's not happening here.  Our washout is getting more than triple the use they had planned. It is getting fuller than they had expected, and most of it is water, putting pressure on the walls of the box.  We're getting into the home stretch when the plywood finally gives way, and the washout dumps several hundred gallons of water onto the dirt.  Now, of course, we can't comply with the super's directions anymore, so we start alternating between the remaining washouts, like normal.  Meanwhile, the water from the busted washout has transformed the entire area into the Swamps of Sadness, and what started as the odd, muddy tire mark across the asphalt is rapidly becoming a thick layer of clay, laminated across the street.  By the time the bastard gets in, it's a complete disaster.  He can't tell what happened, since the busted washout had dumped all its water, and the others are now being used.  It looks like the damn thing just broke.  The dirt on the road is a serious problem, that could get the contractor fined; that has to be taken care of immediately.  He has to hire a street sweeper to clean things up, and, since there are other jobs on the site later that day, he has to keep the sweeper out there until the mud has dried out enough that we aren't constantly tracking it.  \n  \nTL/DR: Contractor cusses out one of our most beloved drivers for using the washout while she was on a job with one of the subs.  After telling her we could only use that washout on his jobs, we proceed to use only that washout, culminating in the destruction of the washout, flooding of the washout area and need to hire a street sweeper.",
