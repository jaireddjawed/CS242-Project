        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/11erbj0/a_look_back_at_teletoon_canadas_cartoon_network/",
        "text": "So, I heard the news that at the end of March. Teletoon a channel that has been with Canada for 25 years, is shutting down and will be rebranded into Cartoon Network.\n\nThis is big for a lot of kids who grew up in the 90s, 2000s, and 2010s. If your a Canadian, Teletoon was our Cartoon Network. So, I'd thought I would take a trip down memory lane, with the history of Teletoon, and the shows that stand out to me.\n\nTeletoon first launched in Canada in 1997, like Cartoon Network it was a channel dedicated to cartoons and animation all over the world. Teletoon also had it's own original shows such as *Ned's Newt, Pippi Longstocking, the Triplets,* a show based on *Donkey Kong Country,* among others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were program blocks dedicated to different demographic. \n\n\\-Morning Planet for Preschoolers with shows like *Magic School Bus.*\n\n\\-Afternoon Planet for Kids with shows like *Scooby Doo.*\n\n\\-Evening Planet for Family with shows like *Donkey Kong Country.* \n\n\\-and Night Planet for Adult with shows like *Duckman.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the first shows I remember seeing was the classic Scooby Doo series. But the show that got me hooked on the channel were reruns of *Fireball XL5.* Aired in 1962 and was from the creator of Thunderbirds, Gerry Anderson. It was the show I would watch during lunchtime, and my favorite part of the show was the theme song at the end of each episode. While other 90s kids were singing  Hakuna Matata, I was singing the Fireball theme song.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther shows that stand out to me were\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Voltron: The Third Dimension.*\n\nI didn't grow up with the original show, because obviously I wasn't born in the 80s. But to me, this was Voltron. Sure the CGI is a little outdated, but it's still an underrated show. Also, Tim Curry as Lotor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe earlier seasons of *The Simpsons.*\n\nThis channel was my introduction to The Simpsons from the classic era. Yes the more recent seasons are shit, but seasons 1-9 still hold up. Ok, not so much Season 1. But those were the seasons that played on Teletoon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ace Ventura The Animated Series.*\n\nDespite knowing about it, I didn't really watch it as a kid. It wasn't until I got the boxset that came with the 2 movies, and a bonus disc which was 3 episodes of the cartoon. A must watch if your a fan of the movies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Cybersix.*\n\nA short-lived animated superhero series, that dealt with mature themes and subject matter for a kids show. it was about a female android battles her evil creator's forces as a mysterious superhero.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ned's Newt.*\n\nA show about a kid named Ned and his pet newt named Newton, who grows 6 feet tall, and who is very similar to the Genie from Aladdin. It was one of their first, and one of their funniest. The voice of Newton was done by comedian Harland Williams.\n\n \n\nThe channel was the main hub for Cartoon Network shows. *Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, Courage the Cowardly Dog* among others. As well as classic Hanna-Barbera shows. *Scooby Doo, Jetsons, Flintstones, Josie and the Pussycats, Wacky Racers.* Etc. And classic Looney Tunes shows like *Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show, and The Road Runner Show.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut my favorite was *Ed, Edd, and Eddy.* \n\nIt's a good example of a show with wacky comedy and stupid characters. But can still be funny and well written.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were shows that I liked as a kid such as *Angela Anaconda, Donkey Kong Country, and Archie's Weird Mysteries.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nArchie's Weird Mysteries was my first exposure to Archie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI played Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo growing up, and of course I saw the TV show. But GOD the characters look unnatural in the series.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAngela Anaconda was a really odd show about the spice of life stories of a girl named Angela and her friends. Why is it odd? Well the animation is like Monty Python mixed with real faces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSadly, these shows don't hold up well as an adult. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther shows were *Mega Babies*......We don't talk about that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was one show called *Redwall*, about mouses defending their home against rats. Yeah it's been awhile since I saw it, and my memory is very vague.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother show I vaguely remember was Captain Star, which was like Star Trek. That's all I know and one of the characters was voiced by Ade Edmondson (Young Ones and Bottom).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I do remember the *Ghostbusters Animated Series and Tales from the Cryptkeeper.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTeletoon also showed Animated movies every Saturday night called *Cinetoon*. There were also bumpers with shorts in-between shows. One of being them *Jean-Luc &amp; Dondoozat*. Teletoon was one of many channels that showed the PSAs for Concerned Children's Advertisers. There were even Teletoon documentaries that go behind the scenes on how different animation styles are done, this was Splat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe late 90s were the golden years for Teletoon in my opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the early 2000s, the channel went through some changes. The Simpsons moved to the Comedy Network, and some of the original shows were not worth writing home about. You had *Braceface and Totally Spies,* but I was not the target audience for those shows. So, no comment. There was For *Better or Worse* based on the newspaper comic. *What's With Andy*, a show about a kid who courses pranks all over his city, and gets in trouble by the end. Rinse and repeat. There was *My Dad The Rockstar*, a show created by Kiss member Gene Simmons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut reruns of shows like Cybersix and Ned's Newt still ran on the channel. The program blocks were nonexistent anymore. Instead new blocks came in, one of them being Teletoon Retro. Which was the block for older cartoons like the *60s Spider-Man and Rocket Robin Hood.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually the block branch out into its own channel, and would last until 2015. Along with classic Hanna Barbera and Looney Tunes. Reruns of shows like *Reboot, Gumby, Transformers, G.I Joe and even the Adam West's Batman show* played on Teletoon Retro. And here's a fun fact, I wrote a letter to Teletoon asking for certain shows to be shown on Teletoon Retro. Two I requested actually made it to the channel. And those shows were *Batman: The Animated Series and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe early 2000s had the Detour later renamed Teletoon at Night, which was the Canadian equivalent to Adult Swim. That block introduced me and others to shows like *Futurama, and Family Guy.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKids WB shows like *What's New Scooby Doo?* and 2004s *The Batman* made there way to Teletoon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe early 2000s was would I like to call the silver age of Teletoon. Everything looked like it was on the right track. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you know what they say, what goes up must come down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me the beginning of the downfall would start around late 2004 and 2005. All starting with *6teen*. I'll try not to step on too many toes, because the show has it's fans. For the time, it was popular in Canada, even I was watching it at 13. But I'm sorry 6teen has aged poorly. the animation isn't good, and the characters were either annoying or unlikeable. It also didn't help that Cartoon Network was going through a similar downfall. Replacing almost of their classic shows, with less then amazing series.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next 5 years can be describe into two simple words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLaziness and Simplicity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mid to late 2000s is what I call the dark years of Teletoon, especially around 2007/2008. Most of the shows from them and Cartoon Network during the period consist of simple generic stories and writing. Cheap lazy gross out humor and slapstick. Sometimes really bad flash animation. It was pretty clear their newer shows during the mornings and evenings stopped trying to be clever and well written shows for all ages, and instead pander to the tween crowd and really younger kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt best shows like *Delilah and Juilius, Carl2, and Wayside* were mediocre. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt worst shows like *the George of The Jungle remake, Johnny Test, and Zeroman* were awful. They were the equivalent of jingling keys in front of a kids face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut not everything was terrible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne show during that era would go on to be the most popular show Teletoon has ever produced. And that of course was *Total Drama Island.* From the creators of 6teen,the show was a parody of reality shows like survivor, featuring 22 teens at a summer camp, who get voted off one by one each episode. The last one standing wins 1 million dollars. When it premiered it was praised by critics and fans, and I have to admit the first season is one of my favorite shows. Why did I like this when I disliked 6teen and the other shows during that time? Well, this series has more interesting and diverse cast of characters, jokes were that actually funny at times, better animation by flash standards. Each character and plotline served its purpose, and didn't overstay it's welcome. Season 1 was the peak of Total Drama, but after that it slowly went downhill. Cartoon Network bought the rights to broadcast Total Drama in the states, and they started meddling with the production. Apparently in the later seasons *Action and World Tour.* Certain storylines and decisions like couples breaking up were not the creators idea, CN told them to do it. \n\nThe fourth season, *Revenge of the Island* was decent. But I gave up on the show after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother show from the creators of 6teen and Total Drama was *Stoked*. Which was basically 6teen but at a hotel resort. It didn't last long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was a block dedicated to Superhero cartoons like *Spectacular Spider-Man, Young Justice, Batman Brave and The Bold, and later on Beware the Batman.*  But the block eventually faded away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust like CN, Teletoon started making their own live action shows during that period. One of them called *My Babysitter's a Vampire.* I don't think anyone remembers or has seen that show. I know I didn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTeletoon at Night was the main hub for *Robot Chicken,* as well as reruns of Family Guy, American Dad, and Futurama. There were 2 original shows from Teletoon called *Dating Guy and Crash Canyon.* I admit watching at 18 and liking them. But they weren't that good. Later came a show called Fugget about it, which was just plain bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole network was just the 6teen/Total Drama channel, and things felt like they were getting worse and worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, things would slowly start to get better around the 2010s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCut to the mid 2010s to present day. Teletoon would air programs such as *Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Infinity Train.* All shows that got critical acclaimed for their writing and characters. Along with *Justice League Action,* which is a criminally underrated show. When Young Justice was revived on DC Universe/HBO Max. Teletoon would aired season 3 and 4 in Canada. While Nickelodeon would air new seasons of Power Rangers in the states. Teletoon would be the home for Power Rangers in Canada from *Megaforce to Dino Fury.* Teletoon at Night was also the main network for *Archer* as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese shows help the network get back on their feet and make it much better then it was back in the late 2000s. Sure, shows like *Teen Titans Go* wasn't the greatest. But it tried harder then George of the Jungle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this mean Teletoon was back to the standards it was in their heyday?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes and No.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind all the shows I've mention were either Cartoon Network or another company. Recent shows made by Teletoon still weren't good. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* *Rocket Monkeys.*\n* *My Butt went Psycho.*\n* *Total Dramarama.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, Cartoon Network now has it's own channel in Canada, with all their shows being available to watch there. Adult Swim had it's own Network in Canada as well. At the start of 2019 Teletoon at Night shutdown, and all the cartoons from that block moved to Adult Swim. It's now the home for *Archer, Rick and Morty, and Harley Quinn The Animated Series.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNetflix in the US and Canada is the new home for Power Rangers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow most of the shows are reruns of CN and Teletoon shows from the 2010s, Batman The Animated Series, Superman, Justice League, and Young Justice. \n\nIt was clear by 2022 that Teletoon's best years were behind them. The last shows I watched on the network was *Adventure Time: Distant Island* back in 2020 and the last season of Young Justice last summer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd on March 27, 2023 Teletoon will be gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf they were to try to recapture their golden years or Teletoon Retro now during the streaming era, it wouldn't be a smart move. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of the shows from the 90s/2000s that I've mentioned can be streamed on Tubi, YouTube, or Shout Factory TV for free. The Simpsons are owned by Disney now, and it can be streamed on Disney+. Also, the kids who grew up on Teletoon in the 90s and 2000s are now adults and have moved on to other things in their lives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't be sad that Teletoon is going, be glad it happened. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn an Nutshell:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe late 90s were the golden years: Some shows like Donkey Kong and Angela Anaconda have aged like milk. But we got shows like Ned's Newt, Ed Edd Eddy, Voltron 3D, Ace Ventura, and Cybersix. As well as reruns of The Simpsons and Fireball XL5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe early 2000s was the silver age: While their original shows were meh. It was the main home for Family Guy, Futurama, The Batman, among others. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe late 2000s was the worst time for Teletoon: There were times when they brought out something good like Total Drama Island. But those moments were rare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mid 2010s to Present day was much better, at least when it came to Cartoon Network shows, original shows not so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you enjoy this lookback on Teletoon. Canada's Cartoon Network for 25 years. What was your favorite show from this channel? Let me know in the comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;***\"What about Caillou? That was one of Teletoon's first shows\"***\n\nThat show doesn't exist. it never happened, it never happened.",

        "text": "I recently finished a rewatch of Supernatural's first 5 seasons for the first time in about a decade. I picked up on the show around 2010, right when season 5 was airing and binged it all on Netflix at that point in time. \n\nI've watched seasons 6-15 and having now rewatched the first 5 seasons again, I can't believe what a steaming pile of crap the rest of the series ended up being. \n\nKripke's treatment through the first 5 seasons is consistent and coherent and builds to an appropriate climax. Those seasons tend to naturally break up into 3 buckets; Seasons 1-2, Season 3, and Seasons 4-5. \n\nThe first two seasons have a certain aesthetic that was never really recaptured in the rest of the series. They were still riding on the dark and grungy look of the early 2000's horror movies. Grey filters, night settings, rain. They did a really good job of shooting horror on a budget with mostly practical effects and camera tricks. The story line through those first 44 episodes wraps up somewhat nicely in the final episode of season 2 where they finally confront the yellow-eyed demon. I know Kripke somewhat wrote that as a close in case they never got picked up again. \n\nSeason 3 was shortened to 16 episodes due to the writer's strike, but looking back it seems the shorter season was a good thing. Many great shows are now producing fewer episodes with higher quality. This season didn't really move the overall plot forward much because it all ended up being for naught; Dean couldn't get out of the demon deal he made in season 2. \n\nSeason 4-5 are the first real departure from the Monster of the Week style that the show had been. People have mixed feelings about this departure, but I think the overall story makes up for that. This is when angels are introduced and the Winchesters find out about their true destinies. They harp on the symmetry between Sam/Dean and Lucifer/Michael and their absent fathers quite a bit. They string along the final battle throughout the last season and don't hint at the possible conclusion until the last couple episodes. The conclusion is very tragic, but very fitting to what they all went through over those 5 seasons. \n\nOverall, it's 126 episodes of interesting TV with only a handful of duds. Sam and Dean are consistently the best part of every episode. It's often the side characters or the plots that make something meh. \n\nI write all of this to highlight just how far the show fell after season 5. It ended up being a complete flip. Seasons 6-15 had a handful of really good episodes with a bunch of meh. Nothing made sense anymore, the canon and lore was progressively tossed out, and the campy side characters started taking center stage. Most of those characters worked in small doses, but they would consistently show up. So much of those seasons were cringy fanservice. The overall season plots were flimsy and rarely lead anywhere substantial. Sam and Dean just seemed to be there dealing with it instead of actually *part* of the story. The writers kept killing and bringing back people just to highlight how much pain the Winchesters have to endure. Sam and Dean would constantly go back and forth lying to each other and betraying each other. And ultimately the series ends on a dud. So much of a dud that it caused a lot of controversy in the fandom (who had already been heavily catered to for a decade). \n\nThe first 5 seasons work too well as a contained series and the remaining 10 seasons just served to taint that. If the show were to ever comeback in some form, I would only want Kripke to come back and begin with an alternate season 6 that ignores 6-15. Pick up with Dean 20 years in the future and Sam having been gone the whole time. I'm sure there's a good story out there, but for now I'll just keep rewatching 1-5 and skipping the rest.",
