Also can you give me any song recommendations?\n\nThank you! :)",

Hence, if the sentence was written like so: 「メアリ－は私にボールを投げられる。」 Would this mean that I was going to throw the ball at Mary? \n\nOf Course Cure Dolly states the Passive Form should be called the Receptive Form, so to phrase it more accurately, does the second sentence「メアリ－は私にボールを投げられる。」state that Mary (receiver), was going to be thrown a ball (Action), by me(doer)?",

        "text": "Decided to finally check it out today and toss it some nuanced questions about Japanese. The answers I got blew me away. Not all of them have been totally correct but that's why I wanted to start this thread for vis into some of the questions:\n\nIE:\n\n========\n\nMe: explain the verb 終わらせる\n\nGPT: 終わらせる (owaraseru) is a Japanese verb that means \"to finish\" or \"to end.\" It is the causative form of the verb 終わる (owaru), which means \"to finish\" or \"to end.\" The causative form is used to indicate that someone or something is causing an action to happen, in this case causing something to finish or end.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to say \"I will finish my homework,\" you could use the verb 終わらせる and say 「宿題を終わらせる。」(shukudai o owaraseru). This literally means \"I will cause my homework to finish.\"\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nMe: Whats the difference between 終わりましょう and 終わらせましょう\n\nGPT: 終わりましょう (owarimashou) and 終わらせましょう (owarasemashou) are both ways to say \"let's finish\" in Japanese, but there is a slight difference in meaning between the two phrases.\n\n終わりましょう is the volitional form of the verb 終わる (owaru), which means \"to finish.\" The volitional form is used to express a suggestion or a desire to do something. So 終わりましょう can be translated as \"let's finish\" or \"let's bring an end to something.\"\n\n終わらせましょう is the volitional form of the verb 終わらせる (owaraseru), which means \"to finish\" or \"to end.\" As I mentioned earlier, 終わらせる is the causative form of the verb 終わる, so it indicates that someone or something is causing the action to happen. Therefore, 終わらせましょう can be translated as \"let's finish\" or \"let's bring an end to something,\" with the implication that we are the ones causing it to happen.\n\nSo the main difference between the two phrases is that 終わらせましょう implies that the speaker is taking an active role in causing the action to happen, while 終わりましょう does not have this implication.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\n====\n\nAnyone else utilizing this?",

Neither of us notified each other of availability over the holidays so I don't know if they are on holiday or something.\n\nAt what point would you change tutor in order to get restarted? I'm generally happy with the lessons (we tend to just go through genki, there is no homework and sometimes they start a little late or finish a little early but it's only 2 or 3 minutes so it's not really worth complaining about. I do believe I am improving). I was thinking of booking someone else at the end of the week if I hear nothing back.",

After we both came home we applied for KCP International. Unfortunately they denied us because both my brother and I never saw college as a necessity and our grades in high school were very mediocre.\n\nI guess my real question is this. Is there anyway to learn Japanese in Japan without a good GPA? I was using immersion learning and Anki for awhile but it's not possible to get a year long visa just to \"learn the language\". I want to start a career as an independent translator or something to do with translation. I don't want to get a job as a teacher just to learn Japanese and want the focus of the time I spend in Japan to be learning the language.\n\nAny help or advice would be really nice as I am stuck trying to figure out a job or school I could use to study abroad. I'm fully aware language is learned by experience and not in a classroom I just want to come over for an extended stay.",

        "text": "I started learning Japanese on Jan 1st, and I'm having way more fun than expected.\n\nOn January 1st I only used Duolingo because it's what introduced me to learning Japanese. On Jan 2nd I found this subreddit and saw the negative sentiment towards Duolingo. So, after seeing all of the negativity and learning about the downfalls of using Duolingo I started researching productive methods of learning.\n\nYesterday I started using tofugus ultimate hiragana guide and today I completed it! I scored 103/105 characters on their quiz.\n\nI feel pretty comfortable reading hiragana kana individually. Learning katakana right away after getting hiragana down sounds repetitive and not very fun yet. I've also read that katakana isn't used very frequently at beginner levels so I'm not very tempted to learn it yet either. I hear Kanji as soon as possible will be beneficial.\n\nSo tonight, I decided to hop back on Duolingo and turn off the Romaji that pairs with the hiragana. I found it to be much more challenging but rewarding this way. I was able to read full (short) sentences completely in hirigana! This seems like a great way to review hirigana and learn vocab to me. \n\nSo going forward, my plan is to follow Tae Kim's complete guide, and use Duolingo with Romaji captions turned off. Then at some point I'll learn katakana after I feel efficient at reading hirigana. I'm curious what all of your thoughts are on this approach.\n\nThank you!",

So my situation is a bit odd, I studied Japanese in the past for around one year but then I had to stop for several reasons.  \nNow it has been 3 years that I didn't touch it at all and I'm all rusty but I want to learn it for real, take the exams and then try to move to Japan to work. (Yes I know how the job culture is there but hey, at each country their own, right?)  \n\n\nWhat I'm wondering is if it is feasible to reach N2 level in one year and also if you would suggest any other website that I can use as a supplement when not having lesson, right now my routine is like this:  \n\n\n\\- 3 Lessons per week  \n\\- 2 Hours each and the 3rd one 1 hour only  \n\\- Working from 9:30 to 6:00 PM, so before that I cant study on my own.  \n\n\nMy level before was around being able to have casual conversations with friends, as such: \"Do you want to go to the Cinema next week? Is it 8 PM fine for you?\" or \"So today I did this and that, how was your day? What have you been up to?\" and so on. Kanji were my weak spot.  \n\n\nI was thinking to spend every single bit of time I have available to keep exercising, might it be quizzes or reading.  \nPersonally I have always found easier to learn how to talk with others rather than how to write or the grammar, it takes much less time compare to the second one.  \nThanks for anyone who might help!",

It appears to be only partially completed, with a roadmap extending into 3rd Quarter of 2023. Currently, there is content for Pre-N5, N5, and \"Lower Intermediate\" N4.\n\nHere's the email description:  \n \n\n&gt;We are proud and very excited to announce the launch of our new Japanese language learning platform, MaruMori.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MaruMori is everything you could want to learn Japanese. It’s the full package, it’s the whole picture, it’s the… milk *and* the cookies. Basically, we wanted to eliminate the need to use (and pay for) multiple platforms. So we created an **all-in-one, guided, gamified Japanese learning experience**. Our aim is for MaruMori to take you all the way from absolute beginner to language mastery, and the best part is you can start **anywhere**.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You’ll find **hand-crafted** **grammar lessons**, packed with detail and language secrets to impress your friends with, as well as **reading exercises** tailored to your level, so you can start reading **real** Japanese right from the start. Not to mention, we’ve curated an extensive **vocabulary database**, our own **kanji learning system**, grammar **drills** and much, much more.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Needless to say, we think it’s pretty awesome, and we’re pretty sure you will too. But hey, don’t just take our word for it. MaruMori is currently in open beta, so go ahead and check it out for yourself, here!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And so in the spirit of the holidays, not only will the **Kitsun lifetime membership be on sale**, but we’re doubling everything up, so you now have a one-time chance to **bundle up a Kitsun and** **MaruMori** **lifetime membership** at a pretty incredible price.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MaruMori’s own individual early access sale is on now too, and the price will be slowly increasing over the coming weeks so I encourage you to act now if you’re interested in supporting the site! (You’ll even get an awesome early-supporter badge!)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Click below to learn more about Marumori and sign up for the **bundle**, or get an extra discount if you already have Kitsun Lifetime.\n\nI find it hard to trust something offering an \"All in One\" for anything, much less learning Japanese. I'm wondering if anyone has pulled the trigger and want to know your thoughts! See [https://marumori.io/#explore](https://marumori.io/#explore) for their features and roadmap.",

The only thing I still have a question on is まだ。I know まだ~ていません means I have not done x yet, but if まだ is with present positive it just means (I’m still doing x) right? And are those the only two ways to use まだ? Sorry in advance",

I tried it but i just couldn't understand how to use it. For example, i decided to use it in the order the chapters were presented, then it would teach me a word with an kanji with it, so that means i had to memorize that kanji? If i don't need to follow the chapter order then how should i study? Same goes with the ideogram book, should i learn some everyday? Or learn the kanjis that were presented in a chapter? Should i learn vocabulary first? I'm completely lost and i feel like this would count to every textbook since it's my first time using one. What should i do?",

        "text": "First off, I have a sleeping disorder and anxeity and it turns out I have ADD, so I get scared of not being able to pay attention, having too little working memory and of not taking in the info, which ironically just slows me down. When you expend so much energy on trying to keep up with something you just kind of can't, then the energy you actually need to do the thing gets lessened. \n\nBut I don't think that's just it. I was simply reading TOO conciously. See as I learned to read, I had to pay attention to how kanji looked, what words there are and how they sound. Given that it's so different from my other languages and has so many characters, it resulted in staying with those habits I built up. It's like if I would try to play a guitar riff fully conciously instead of letting my muscle memory do it. \n\nBut what works is to just.. let it all go and just let my brain do the work. Stop caring about how the characters look, stop caring about words, stop being scared of not taking things in, just..  scan, your subconcious will pick up the patterns before you can even subvocalize them and they will be blocked less. I simply needed more trust in my subconscious, my past training has already been done, it has enough to do it on it's own. When my sunvocalizing is in the way (it's just how my mind works, very little visualization, lots of verbalization), I try to think of very fast or sped up speech in YouTube videos and do it at that pace and read faster than I think I could handle. \n\nOne caveat is that there will be words I forget how to read or words I don't know. Normally I'd get stuck on these words, but instead, it works to just not give a shit and move on, at least then you can catch the other stuff. Once you really don't get it or need a reading you can pause and look in your conciousness and try to correct it, but I need to at least let the sentence finish before I do so. \n\nSure that doesn't put me at a super fast level, but it's much more acceptable. It's super funny because in the past I always felt like \"When I pretend I know more than I do and feel confident I feel like I understand more\". That may actually be true, because a lack of confidence makes you think about things conciously and expend energy elsewhere.",

Though I imagine listening to Japanese music would be beneficial, i don’t really have the foundation to understand pretty much any of the words.
