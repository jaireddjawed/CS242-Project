I'll post them all if you like them.\n\nSo this was the first one i ever experienced.\nI was having a little campfire on my block of land, located behind a local hotel. There are not lights, and it's a private driveway; kinda hard to find. So after 25 minutes the pizza guy arrives. He pulls up in the bitumen driveway, we're standing and waiting, but he doesn't see us (it's dark). BUT he sees the light from the campfire, and decides to drive across the grass. His car gets bogged in some muddy ruts. It took the poor guy about 30 minutes for us to get it out. After a difficult and exhausted half hour the car is freed. He gets the pizza out of the car and hands us the boxes. He got the order wrong. He grabbed the wrong pizzas and is 30 minutes late to whoever's order that was. He apologizes a lot and says he'll drive back and get us our order. As he drives off the back lights come on and i see he's dropped 2 $100 notes in the mud. We grab them and try to get his attention but he's already halfway up the driveway. \n\nWe decide to drive to the pizza store to return the money and as we walk in the door i got to witness this guy lose his job. \n\nTL;DR pizza guy gets bogged for 30 minutes, gets order wrong and lost $200, gets fired.

When I got there I saw 2 very large Rottweilers waiting to greet me, now I am definitely what you'd call a dog person however I had been here before and they didn't seem too friendly the first time (barking aggressively and such) and the customer was waiting out the front which made everything easier.\n\nSo I thought instead of trying to traverse the guarded K9 territory I'd just give them a call and have them meet me out the front. \n\nM: Me.     C: Customer. \n\nM: Hi there this is Rebirth from the pizza shop, I'm just out the front and.......\n\nBefore I could finish my explanation on why I wasn't going to try coming in she cut me off. \n\nC: OH! You're out the front, sorry give me a sec I'll be right there. *hangs up*\n\nSo I think ok cool, I'll just wait on this side of the fence. \n\nAbout 10 seconds later this women, who I could only describe as the stereotypical \"MILF\" for lack of a better word, comes rushing out of the house in nothing but a very slim fitting T-Shirt and underwear. Took me by surprise to say the least. But the old hospitality training kicked in and I pretended not to notice and explained why I wouldn't come in, to which she replied:\n\"Oh the gate is locked anyway so you wouldn't have been able to come in if you tried, anyway have a good night.\" And rushed back inside as quick as she came out. \n\nI mean for starters we tell people when to expect their pizza, there was no comment on my ticket telling me to call her, I just did that to save myself the trouble, and lastly who leaves their gate padlocked leaving no indication on how to get into contact with them. \n\nAnyway, that was an interesting delivery to say the least.

One notable one (and one that makes me very happy) is the Santa Clause incident.\n\nA few nights ago, I took out what I had thought would be any normal, last delivery of the night. Drove to the customer's house in record time and rang the doorbell as usual. This is where things got interesting. \n\n2 kids around the age of 5-7 swing open the door. Kid 1 charges at me and gives me a huuuuuge bear hug that is bigger than he could possibly manage. Kid 1: \"SANTA CLAUSEEEEEEEE!!!!!!\" Kid 2 stares at the exchange in silence. I try to respond with \"I don't think I'm Sa..\" and get cut off by Kid 1 saying \"Is this your first time delivering here? ALL Chinese delivery drivers are Santa Clause!\" (What puts the icing on the cake is that I'm Chinese. And I deliver Chinese. Heh.)\n\nAmidst all the cheering, the father appears between the kids and apologizes. I ended up leaving with both a decent tip and a huge smile on my face. As a driver, it's always nice to encounter a pleasant surprise such as this. Ranks up there with customers inviting me in on a rainy day while they sign for their orders.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but these small but awesome interactions make the job just a bit easier to manage on rough days. And, last but not least, to all you amazing customers out there that go out of their way to put a smile on your driver, or to make their day or night a little bit easier, thank you! We ALL appreciate your kindness and consideration!\n\n**tl;dr - Last delivery of the night. Kid opens door, claims I am Santa and gives me a huge hug. Explains why I am Santa.

        "text": "This happened yesterday during one of the final deliveries of my shift. The house that I was to deliver to was pretty close, about five minutes or so away. The order was a little over $10 and I wasn't expecting that big of a tip. I arrived at the house and went around back (as instructed by the customers) and a bunch of 18-20 year olds were sitting around a fire. One of the girls came up to me  and handed me $20, and wanted $4 back. This would have left me with a respectable tip, however, one of the guys around the fire proceeded to yell, \"Give him a good tip! I'm a delivery guy too!\" The girl hesitated and said \"Just keep it.\" So I end up leaving with a very generous tip all thanks to a fellow delivery man who didn't even know me! A pretty good way to end a shift if I do say so myself! I do, however, feel that the girl probably regret that decision after I left xD! Poor girl got peer pressured.\n\nEdit 1: My choice use of the word \"respectable\" may have come across as \"decent\" and made me appear spoiled or unappreciative. Would like to clear that up. I was very happy with what the woman was going to give me and was even more delighted when she ended up giving me more. I apologize for not choosing my vocabulary carefully, as it did not reflect my true feelings during the particular moment in the events that I described above. ",

The manager has instructed everyone who closes checks to go by the total as written by the customer ONLY, and to assume any illegible numbers are 0s.  \n\nToday, I took a delivery and the total was $57.98.  The customer clearly wrote \"$10.00\" on the tip line, and the total as \"$67.[squiggle squiggle.]  The cashier gave me $9.02 for the tip.  I asked the GM, and she gave me some stupid line about how the total amount is legally binding and PH could get sued if the customer was expecting to see a $67.00 charge and got a $67.98 charge instead.  I pretended like this was a new thing I was learning and said something like \"oh, I'll double check next time, sorry!\" because I $0.98 is not the hill I want to die on.  However.\n\nI have always gone by the rule of thumb, \"if the customer's intention is clear and they flubbed the math, fix it, but if there is any question at all, rule in favor of the customer.\"  In over a decade of working in restaurants, I do not know of one case of a customer contesting a credit card charge.  Ostensibly \"always go by the total no matter and assume every ambiguous digit is a 0\" will help me as often as it hurts me, and one time I did get an extra dollar from a math-challenged patron, but it seems that more often than not, I just get short changed on whole-number tips where the total is blurry.  \n\nI've adopted the strategy of saying \"make sure you print your total clearly, my manager is a stickler and sometimes I get short changed if it's not easily readable\" but I'm not a huge fan of that solution.  \n\nDoes anyone else's store do this?  I mean, being insane is a prereq for being a GM for PH, but this seems a little extreme, especially in the case I mentioned where the customer's intention was clearly to give me a $10.00 tip, there was no math error, he just didn't write \".98\" clear enough for her.\n",

        "text": "   There are two stores of my pizza chain in my town, and we get a lot of calls that should go there and vise versa. The other day I picked up the phone and it was the owner of my store, who was at the other store dropping off flour when a web delivery came in that is just barely in our range, but definitely not theirs. Given he would be back the next day the other store would keep the prepaid order, pay him, and we would send delivery with one of our drivers. He told me the order on the phone, I sent it in as a comp'd delivery, and given I was the only driver, in 15 mins I was on my way. He told me on the phone before I hung up they would tip at the door, so cool. \n\n  I get there, no tip, just a sign of the slip and a shut door. It was a smaller kid so it was whatever, I had a good day nonetheless. The next day I show up for work and the owner and my boss are talking when he comes over and thanks me for helping him do that yesterday, given the phone girl was new. He asked if they had tipped and I replied, \"Nah they didn't but I had other runs that way\". He then handed me a crisp 5 dollar bill, calling it gratitude for the long drive (16 mins one way), saying he \"hates people like that,\" knowing damn well he has never taken a delivery in his life haha. \n    ",

Everyday our drivers have to take free complaint orders to 10-15 different customers who have called about their pan pizza being burnt this is a huge loss for driver wages. Not to mention, pan pizzas have to go through the oven 1 and a half times...meaning it is a gigantic pain that takes longer than any other product in our store to make. Did I mention the marketing team decided to make pan pizzas with 3 toppings only $10...it's the most demanded item in the store and our employees hate it with a passion. \n\nAside from those downsides...our late drivers hate their lives as well, considering they get to wash 150 pizza pans on top of the massive amount of regular dishes at the end of the night. Our workers go over their shift times by 1-2 hours on a regular basis. Our competition, Pizza Hut, is equipped with a dish washing machine to clean their pans. Seems like an enormous oversight on behalf of Papa Johns...\n\nBasically the pan pizzas we offer are a giant loss of revenue for the store, and a giant pain in the ass for the employees. Great job \n",

If there are other customers like me reading this, please pay attention.\n\nI called up. Let them know what happened, the girl was really nice and took full responsibility for the mess up. I still ate it and am happily full. I only said to be a bit more vigilant with online orders because I know that adds another point of failure into the mix. I told her it was no problem and that we have ordered, I would have to guess, over 100 pizzas from them with no mistake. I wasn't angry and only wanted to make them aware for the future. \n\nEveryone can make a mistake. If it's the first time out of many, let it go. It's just a pizza. Don't become some billigerant ass hole over one mistake, it happens. The input from a good customer will have such a better impact than that of an asshole. I could hear the \"oh fuck\" in her voice and the relief of me saying, \"it's ok\" don't fuck with people that handle your food. \n\nOn a side note: I didn't ask for anything or to be refunded. I just went without pepperoni. I'll will get over that a lot quicker than a worker will over being verbally beaten over fucking pepperoni. ",

        "text": "This is a recurring problem for me, but it's the customer's fault. Let me explain.\n\nWhere I deliver, it's... Typically a bad neighborhood, but nobody fucks with the delivery guy. The delivery guy's the guy who brings you your food when you're too high or lazy to get it yourself. Keep him happy, he keeps you happy.\n\nThe problem is that these guys will crank the music on their headphones, in the back of the house/apartment- and not have a working doorbell. This is a problem.\n\nWhy? Typically I start off with the doorbell- if I don't hear it, I will knock three times. Once, I will knock \"normally\". If you don't answer or make some sign of life in 30 seconds (a light coming on elsewhere, footsteps, even a yell of \"AYY HOLD UP A SEC LEMME GET MY PANTS\"), I will knock again. Failing that, I will do the cop-knock.\n\nYou know the one. Hard, authoritative \"Hey, asshole, open the door.\" knock. I do it because it works.\n\nI've gotten complaints because \"This guy knocks like he's trying to bust the door down!\" a few times. Some houses I know don't hear the normal knock, and no working doorbell. So I default to the cop-knock because otherwise they'll just sit there like \"durr there's a pizza guy's car outside and there's knocking at the door, I wonder what this could be\".\n\nI won't knock like the police if you learn to realize when the damned pizza is coming, stop calling the store to whine and bitch about \"The pizza guy scared me, knocking like the police! ;-;\". I knock like that because I'll test the doorbell, then normal knock. If there's no signs of life, I will knock harder.\n\nYes, it scares the everloving shit out of you. But if you don't learn to answer your door when someone knocks like a normal person and you're expecting your food, you deserve to get spooked.\n\nBrief aside; anyone who owns a dog should teach it to not jump at the pizza guy. Some of us will send your chihuahua into low-Earth orbit for biting their ankle. \n\nI just needed to vent.\n\nEditing: Do any of you ever deal with this problem? How do you knock?\n\nTL;DR people are cunts who can't be ready for their food to arrive and get scared when I knock like a cop after they don't answer their door following doorbell and two normal knocks. Also, people can't control their rats.",

EXCEPT THEY DO. We have realtime car tracking. UGH!\n\nAnyway on to the real topic of this post. Instead of the usual 30-35 mother at the door it's a 20-25 year old girl. The delivery is 65 minutes long, and we try to get the food to the customer within 45min-1hr. Therefore I offer my usual apology. I usually get a \"no problem\" or \"have a good day\" I'll get the usual complaints, that's whatever. \n\nInstead, its \"that's no problem, baby\" I ignored this comment. Honestly this stuff doesn't bother me one bit. I honestly like it. I said my usual \"have a good night\" reply. Instead I get this chick, coming out of the apartment and demanding that I be her boyfriend and shit. I responded with \"nah\" I'm not sure why I used this word, but it really made her agitated. At this point I didn't give a shit. She started yelling at me and telling me that I suck while walking towards me and saying I'm a asshole and I just got in my car and left.\n\nI just want to get it out there that I felt Ike I could physically take her if necessary, I had a height and weight advantage. It still was disturbing though. I also would like to point out that I am not against light flirting by customers, even at night. But if someone isn't interested, don't continue to try, especially at night in a bad area.\n\nWell I would have swiped her left on tinder before, now I'm going to swipe her order left every time it comes up. \n\n",

First of all, working at a corn maze does not mean you know anything about customer service, especially in the food industry. It's a corn maze. How much can be fucked up?! Second, the girl (likely an old woman being a Wednesday night) probably asked if the quote times were correct, which we do a good job of staying on top of them so that's why he'd say yes. Had she said \"Is the future order in the oven\" or something clearer, she would have gotten the appropriate response. I wasn't even there so it actually wasn't me, but I can tell who it was based on the context. He's direct (like me) so if you ask a question, you get an answer. If you asked the wrong question, how would he know? And finally, fucking entitled bitch. Some miscommunication and waiting and you want the whole thing free?! No. Be happy you got offered anything. If you want to eat at a specific time, cook yourself. If you order from a restaurant, understand that shit happens or fuck right off. \n\nEnd rant. ",

Two of my first 4 deliveries were to the absolute bottom of our delivery area and takes sometimes up to 40mins to run. Tips are complete crap, I'm on my way to the 2nd delivery of my double. Which is a guaranteed stiff and my fourth of the day. Knocked on customer's door. As usual their dog greets me first,(why do dog owners not put their dogs away, when the know they're getting delivery?) She's a friendly pit bull and guess what happens when the customer grabs for the food? Yep, you guessed it. Dog runs out. Funny thing is after she runs around me sniffing and wagging her tail, she bolts for my vehicle and into the driver's seat,  because I left the door open. I know, should never be done, but car was in my eyesight with no one around. For the next 5mins the owner couldn't keep the dog out of my car. Each time she'd get the pit bull out, she'd run right back into my car. It was like a chase scene from an old Benny Hill episode, lol. It definitely made a shity day better!\n\n\nTl;Dr Shity day at work dealing with a migraine and anemic tips, had a customer's super friendly pit bull try to runaway with me.\n\nDone on phone, sorry for any errors",

        "text": "Hey guys. Found this sub sometime yesterday evening, have been binging on it since. Felt like sharing a couple applicable stories since one happened pretty recently, so I made an account. \n\nSome background: I work at... I've worked there for close to five years now and I still don't know what we are. It's a mid-sized chain in the Midwest that can't make up its mind. I guess primarily we're a deli, maybe something like McAlister's with a drive thru. Somewhere around 40% of our business is dine-in and drive thru, and the rest is catering delivery, which can be sandwich trays, salad trays, fruit platters, etc., or glazed hams, casseroles, rolls... we do some smaller delivery as well, but relatively few individual orders. Like I said, we're all over the place. \n\nAnyway, being there as long as I have, I've learned just about everything. This first story takes place just a few days ago, on a double. Because of my boss's obsessive labor management (which I'm sure NONE of you can relate to), I'm the supervisor on duty, as well as the front counter cashier, which includes being the only one answering the phones. It isn't usually that bad during the dead zone between lunch and dinner, but the phones were ringing off the hook! I was literally hopping from one to the next, holding people, taking catering order after catering order for the next day. \n\nDon't even get me started on the \"uhh, how much advance notice do you guys need for an order X big??\" people. \n\nIt was a full hour I was on the phone, due to being the only one on staff who knows how to properly take down all the necessary info and, when needed, ring in a quote. Due credit to my crew for keeping the rest of the store running this whole time. \n\nIf I remember correctly, it was the ninth and final order I took down that was unusual. Being a chain, we try to respect the other store's delivery zones, and typically don't go much further than around ten miles. This was a pharmaceutical rep requesting delivery to a small clinic a full hour away from our location. A quick google showed me it was roughly equidistant from the other stores, and a text from my boss confirms yes, we'll take it, at triple the usual $5 delivery fee. SOLD! 25 person order, clocking in around $450. I helped her pick out everything she needed from our menu and nailed down the details. \n\nI'm not the catering coordinator, but as closing supervisor I do have to give thought to how the next morning's going to go. And, shit, we've got three drivers to take the ~15 orders tomorrow, mostly clustered around lunch time. A two-hour round trip takes one of them completely out of commission. \n\nCall it greed, call it altruism, but I said hey, I'll come in on my off day to take it. I actually enjoy just driving and blasting metal. Plus, I figured, this is a pharm rep buying lunch for an entire clinic. These multi-million or -billion dollar companies throw around money like monkeys at the zoo! This should be good, not to mention a potentially profitable account for the future. \n\nFast forward through the extra three hours of prep work that night and some Netflix-fueled sleep deprivation, and I show up with Monster in my veins and a full gas tank the next morning. Load up, take the full hour drive out to the sticks, call ahead to confirm back-door delivery (heh) like most clinics seem to prefer, carry everything in four loads through their Byzantine corridors to the break room, set it all up...aaaand the rep isn't there yet. \n\nFortunately she doesn't keep me waiting for long, she's apologetic, completely friendly, signs my receipt and off I go, smiles and happy farewells. \n\nI've learned not to even look at the receipt until I'm back in my car. Blank gratuity line. \n\nWell, whatever. I've also learned to take this kind of shit in stride. One thing about food service is that everyone has to eat, and when your subset is everyone, a certain percentage are going to be like this. Most of them have no idea how the business works. \n\nHour drive back. Normally the driver gets half of that $5 delivery fee, so thankfully I get $12.50 for my gas. \n\nThis was more long-winded than I had intended. I'll comment my second story if anyone wants to hear it. ",

FRONT DOOR. I say \"well he'll come down and turn it off right?\" \"No she says, he's in the shower, he won't hear anything!\". FRONT DOOR.

As I am getting into the car and getting ready to leave - FRONT DOOR - I hear the house phone ring, which I am sure is the alarm company calling to see if they want to report a break in. FRONT DOOR.\n\nI drove away laughing my ass off. A complete gong show.

Word comes in that a couple Domino's drivers had been robbed earlier in the day, so now I feel certain. I get a call for a \"1/2\" address (behind the main house.) I take all my money and give it to the cook to hold and stuff my wallet behind the back seat armrest. \n\nWhen I get to the house, there are about 5-6 guys out front my age (I was 17). One is a friend of mine holding an IBC rootbeer and says the others are making a pizza run and are stupid. I think he's drunk and had never heard the term before and one guy comes and tells me through the sunroof that his mom has the money and I've got to go to the back. Address checks out but before I can tell him to meet me with the money up front, he takes off to the back.\n\nI grab the pizzas and the money bag and cautiously follow him through the gate and stand about 10-15 feet back as he knocks on the back door saying, \"Come on, come on\" like his mom needs to hurry. Another dude walks through the gate.\n\nIn the instant I turned to see the guy coming through the gate, the first guy jumps me. I immediately drop the pizzas and bag and new guy runs off with them. Meanwhile, this guy is hitting me in the chest and back with his arms fully outstretched from side to side. This does very little to me and I just kind of stand there assessing the situation. This frustrates him and he backs up with his arms outspread, \"Come on, Motherfucker!\" I give him a look that says, \"You expect me to fight you for someone else's pizzas that aren't even here?!?!\"\n\nHe runs off and when I get back to work they make me close before I can go to the police station to report it. When I get there, he's on the phone and they let him talk to me. \"If we pay for the pizzas can we call it even?\" I told him it was all corporate now, which I made up. Weeks later he threatens my friend who acted as a witness by saying, \"I don't want to threaten you or nothin' but I have been in jail for shooting someone.\" My friend reports that too, and last I heard he was doing a long stretch in the pen. My friend also said it was best I didn't fight the guy as he was usually packing.\n\nIcing on the pie: Pizza Inn at the time gave us exact change for the $20 amount higher than the order. The order was $39.61 and that meant they robbed me for three pizzas that ended up at the police station and 39¢. \n\nI then went to my friend's party and had a good time.",

        "text": "I've been where I currently work for two years. During that first year was with an owner who had built five successful restaurants from the ground up. No franchising. He sold the place I'm at to three guys. One, literally never there, I've never met him. Another; has apparently owned a couple of bars, only bartends on Saturday. The other, in his late twenties, is there every day and has never owned a business.\n\nThey've been a problem since they've been here, tbh. All but 3 of the previous staff either straight quit, or went out and found another opportunity, leaving in disgust by the way the place is run. ...I only deliver, but I don't give up easy and look for solutions. I only recently got them to start putting out a schedule every week by Friday. (They were previously doing so on the Tuesday after the week had started... if we were lucky.)\n\nBut here's my most grating issue. That second owner who bartends on Saturday's likes to keep the bar open after everyone has gone home. We close at 11pm, he's been known to hang around to 2am. That means we can't clean. Sunday at 11am, when we open, the bar is a mess, dishes are stacked halfway to the ceiling, the floors haven't been mopped (we can't do it with customers there), and we've got prep to do. And extra cleaning tasks on Sunday's that take an exceptional amount of time.\n\nThe third owner I mentioned has been working with my complaints. Getting the schedule right, doing inventory twice a week, and some other things. It's embarrassing that I have to be the one to bring those things up, but someone needs to. However, he has no power to get the place to close on time. Second owner isn't budging. Hell, this Saturday, the 29th before Halloween there is a costume party going from 10pm - 12am. I only found out because of the promotional posters on the walls. I asked, \"Do you have anyone scheduled for that extra time?\" The reply, \"We're not planning on having as many people as we did last year.\" ....That wasn't the question, I know they're going to trash the place. They had a late night party last Monday, left the place in a mess... I even found trash from the bar sitting out in the rain overnight in front of our locked dumpster.\n\nHealth inspector is probably coming within the week. Is leaving a restaurant in a mess at the end of the night a health code violation? Either way, I think it's fucking disgusting. And people come in just before we open, meaning customers have been exposed to this shit. Dirty floors and tables first thing in the morning.\n\nI keep thinking of quitting like everyone else, but I make fair money on deliveries, it's the only area where we don't get constant complaints and there's not much competition around. Unless I find a good salary job, there's no better hourly jobs in the area. Then I keep trying to solve these ridiculous issues instead. I told owner three that I can't be the most responsible person in the place, it's embarrasing. That helped move him forward a little bit, but I feel like I'm babysitting a couple of brats who turned a once very tight ship and awesome restaurant into a personal plaything. (And the reviews + [lengthy facebook conversations](https://www.facebook.com/groups/222615474563312/permalink/660692094088979/) reveal how it's gone to shit.)\n\nSomeone tell me you've had to deal with something similar.\n\nNote: No, I don't need to be anonymous, no point in mentioning it. I've been very candid about all this because I'm not afraid of getting fired. I'm just trying to get some tips, what you would do, if you think I'm overthinking anything, etc.",
