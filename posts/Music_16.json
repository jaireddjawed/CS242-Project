Unfortunately, my old band mates and I moved to different areas after high school and so it’s been difficult to find new people to play with. \n\nWith that being said, I still had the need to create, and I now have almost a full album done! It’s an instrumental album called “Unsung” and it’ll be out in June.\n\nThe first song, linked below, is a good introduction into the vibe of this album. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n[Losing Myself](https://open.spotify.com/album/1AOgAn47nXL2iug4C2iCCs?si=j5LgFGucQkepWk3Kh33bmA&amp;app_destination=copy-link)",

Mostly I'll ignore it, but then a song will come on but wait it's not that song. It's a crappy not-really-a-cover version where the artist has taken the chorus and melody of the song but stuck in their own (nearly always worse) lyrics and put it to some anemic synth or EDM or something.\n\nSo far I've heard: \n\n Every Breath You Take  \nI'm Blue  \nCan't Take My Eyes Off You (at least that one seems to be a proper cover as the lyrics haven't been drastically changed).  \nRocket Man  \nDancing in the Moonlight (again at least seems a real cover even if I don't particularly care for the depressed EDM version it is).  \nHey There Delilah (but the big and apparently great change according to an article I read was the only word that was changed was Delilah to Everybody). \n\nWith other swearing they've heard versions of:\n\nIn the End and One Thousand Miles. \n\nI'm not against covers as a practice. A lot of everyone's favorite versions of songs are covers. I'm not against using the general melodic vibe of a song like Biz Markie using the beat from Freddie Scott's original You Got What I Need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's just this feels not only wholly unoriginal but almost like theft and plagiarism, and I'm just trying to figure out what is letting this happen.
