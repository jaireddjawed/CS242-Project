        "text": "It takes countless hours of work to create the mechanics, levels, assets, animations, AI, music, models, cutscenes, shaders and a ton of other things before a triple A release gets even near to its completion. Compared to that, fixing or preventing technical missteps seems like a relatively easy task, so I'm constantly baffled by releases that squander all of that development effort by neglecting basic options and accomodations.\n\nFor example, mouse controls. Games have used raw mouse data since forever and there's no valid reason to do anything else, but so many titles mess that up. Sensitivity changing with framerate, forced acceleration or deceleration, smoothing, deadzones and whatever else. Moving the camera is the most basic functionality a player will immediately encounter and use for the whole game in most 3D titles, and it's their way of expressing skill in shooters particularly, so how do games with tons of care put into small graphical details get seemingly 0 thought or work put into something that will instantly make a game not fun to play for so many people?\n\nMore examples include: Field of View sliders, unlocked framerates, button remapping, stick deadzone sliders, options to turn off aim assist, skippable cutscenes, actual pausing, ways to disable graphical features that already have options tied to them in the settings, motion blur and screen shake toggles, hold vs toggle options for basic actions like aiming, crouching and sprinting, proper sensitivity sliders with sufficient range and precision, symbols for important elements mainly conveyed through colours, vertical sensitivity sliders, options to disable QTEs, pre-compiling shaders, v-sync toggles.\n\nThat seems like a lot to keep track of, but keep this in mind - almost any given item on that list would take way less effort than implementing inverse kinematics, creating assets for a single level, recording and cleaning up motion captured animations or making custom tech for handling hair rendering. Just think about it - many AAA games have more thought and work put into a single cutscene than into their control layout.\n\nFeet clipping into the ground won't bother me if the game feels so bad to control I'll abandon it immediately, or if I can't remap an important function from a button I physically can't press easily, or if the narrow field of view or intense screen shake makes me sick. It seems backwards to have people put so much work into an experience, only to then neglect mostly basic or long since figured out things that will determine whether a potential player will be able to actually interact with the game properly and without constant annoyances. \n\nA missing texture ruins how a single object looks. A missing accessibility option ruins the entire game.\n\nSo why does any of this happen? Is it a lack of specific positions that are clearly responsible for the presence and quality of features like these? Not including these aspects in playtests, or not hiring playtesters who could give feedback on these issues due to lack of accessibility needs or familiarity with games sufficient to have any standards? Leaving these things for last minute where most shortcuts are made to make deadlines?",

Like Re4 and Dead space looked brownish, bioshock looked greenish, and so on with so many games.\n\nAnd this is not only coming from a graphics perspective, but also from a gameplay one, hyperrealism drags down gameplay, it makes it slower and uninspired just to fit realism like you're handicapped and can't do much cool and crazy moves\n\nIn the current direction, it's very rare to see a stylized game, as I said most of them look identical now",

But I don't think every, or even most games should favour FPS experience above all else in terms of who performs better. This doesn't make sense for games where sheer aim and movement skill isn't the top priority.\n\nIt just seems like an annoying phrase people use to shut off any criticism a person may have. Because, yeah... I have a skill issue and I admit that. But so what? I'll still point out what might frustrate me in a game. And my lack of skill shouldn't invalidate that immediately.",

        "text": "Just how random, inconsistent and sometimes outright buggy alt tabbing support and fullscreen support is. I should also mention that this is more or less talking with windows 10 as my primary experience. Some games let you move the mouse outside the boundary of the game, some don't. Some games, when you click outside the game while using a DSR virtual resolution higher than native for your game monitor, they minimize and change your resolution, but some games don't behave like that. It gets even more granular. Elden ring is a good example. I can use a DSR res (2160p on 1080p), hit the windows key, click off onto my second monitor, and it doesn't minimize the game and change the res back to native in fullscreen. Cyberpunk will, just about any source game will. Any rockstar game will.\n\nThere's also inconsistency with controller input in borderless windowed modes. RDR2 for example, if I click outside the game window in borderless windowed, my controller will still take inputs even though its not the \"active\" window and I can click and type in one window and use my controller to play the game at the same time. Other games while also using borderless windows, if you click out, you cannot use your controller. (Elden ring again is a good example of this)\n\nMy point is I feel this is an aspect of PC gaming that isn't thought about much by developers and is genuinely annoying if trying to multitask, and some games make it easy while others its super difficult.  There's always some new quirk to learn. And even IN the games where they make alt tabbing or clicking off easy, they have their different quirks how they behave. Its not standardized and makes multitasking or using the rest of your PC while playing a game a nightmare.",

        "text": "So this is a skill issue before anyone says it. I have terrible aim despite playing FPS games for years. I play Battlefield alot and it usually takes several games in a row before my aim gets alright ish, but nonetheless I still to this day lose in almost every firefight. Much of the time even when I have the advantage.\n\nSo, instead of improving my quick aim, I decided to play in ways that don't require quick aim. Taking advantage of stealth and medium range shooting so I can take my time lining up my shots without being shot at. I know people complain about players who stay still for more than 5 seconds, but I don't really care honestly. People can play how they want.\n\nGenerally, I prefer slower paced FPS games with larger maps as they give players far more options beyond fast aim and fast movement. If you're bad at CoD or Valorant and can't move quickly to avoid getting hit, then you could play a different game where can move very little to avoid being spotted. With things like foliage, terrain, and the contrast between the player and the environment allowing for such gameplay.\n\nWhat games are there where stealth, range and positioning are favoured above close, fast paced and generally fast reaction dependant gameplay? Preferably with team oriented gameplay too as oppose to every man/squad for themselves. Like PUBG 50v50 games for example where both teams might meet in the middle.",

        "text": "I've been thinking on this subject on and off for a long time, I'm a huge fan of Science Fiction books and film, and so far, no game has ever nailed that vibe I get from reading about exploring space, I wonder if its even possible.\n\nLet's look at some examples of how you can do your space sandboxes.\n\nI'm reminded of the story from the development problems of Mass Effect 2 ( or was it 3? I forget) , where they had to start again halfway through, as their original plan was to have some form of procedural planet generation with freeform exploration.\n\nThey abandoned it because they couldnt find a way to make it \"fun\"\n\nThen you have No Mans Sky, which was lauded as providing that SF novel exploration vibe, I was so excited for it, I thought itd be the game that nailed it finally, yet left me ( and I assume many others ) feeling like it was quite empty and repetitive.\n\n\nAnd this pattern repeats, for one simple fact:\n\nSpace is cool, but space can also be very boring.\n\nIn real life, the majority of planets might be pretty and interesting to look at for a while, but are mostly just endless variations on a barren theme, you enter a new solar system - and you get more of the same.\n\nA space sandbox needs something *more*\n\nYou have a few options in my opinion:\n\n1) lean into the sandbox:\ntake the Minecraft approach\nNo Mans sky sorta tried this, but the Minecraft approach needs to be ALL-IN otherwise it dosnt have that LEGO set appeal.\n\n2) lean into the vibe:\nElite Dangerous sorta achieved this, limit the scope of the game, it is what it is, its space trucking simulator, and it looks and sounds great ( especially in VR ) - but it aint really a space exploration sandbox in the fullest sense.\n\nGoing back to No Mans Sky which didnt (for me ) provide the sandbox elements fully, also didnt provide the vibe for me, which I thought itd be the one thing it could fall back on.\n\nAt least Elite Dangerous knows it dosnt do anything else, and excels at the one thing it focuses on.\n\n3) Add a proper story and guiding theme throughout to add structure to the sandbox\n(Mass Effect is better when it abandoned the sandbox for this - as that is obviously Biowares strength ) , and No Mans Sky waved a hand generally in this direction with its \"story\" but not really.\n\n\nI guess classic games like Star Control 2(Ur-Quan masters) can count as a good implementation of this, but its not immersive by modern standards, nor is it replayable with procedural generation.\n\n4) lean into the mechanics\n\nI suppose games like the X-series fall into this category, its in space sure, but its all about the progression, the acquiring resources and some fighting.\n\nAlso Kerbal Space Program - this is all about the mechanics.\n\nI think Starfield could be an interesting upcoming example, Bethesda have the resources and knowledge in this area to achieve both the story structure *and* sandbox elements\n\nStar Citizen would fall into the mechanics category I think.\n\nI'd also like to see more space games use VR in the future as that could really improve the vibe/immersion aspect.\n\nMy question is, what ways can you make a space sandbox, perhaps with procedural generation, actually fun, with the cool space vibe of exploring the unknown? many have tried, none have really nailed it, is it a matter of \"we think we know what we want, but we dont\"?\n\ni.e - we think space is cool, but actually, its mostly not?",

        "text": "It's quite common to accuse devs of cutting corners, repeating elements like areas, assets, lack of QA etc.\n\nI am actually going to point out the opposite problem. Now it may be sound odd because why is it a problem that devs are putting too much effort regardless of the output. However, I do think it can be a problem since time and resources are finite and making most of available resources to craft the best possible game is something both dev and consumers want. \n\nThis topic came to my head again after I recently finished Kentucky Route Zero. The game had far too much and same time  nothing much of substance since any narrative impact got lost in the laborous and way too long of a journey. Actually the game could have worked better if they stayed inside a small map and keep it open to explore and play out scenarios based on where the main characters go. Instead they railroad very awkwardly with tons of wall of text to drag the game down.\n\n\nAnother game that does far too much for very less was Genesis Noir. It was quite a short game so atleast it didn't feel like it overstayed it's welcome. The devs put so much effort, but the gameplay was very barebones. Actually, there are a few gameplay elements they could have reused to put the some depth to the game and make it more gamey. In the end it was just a animated abstract virtual installation.\n\nOne example of AAA game doing far too much to so little was TLoU2. They made a rope animation that looks quite realistic. They could have made rope usable mechanically which could have enhance the game. The gameplay was a slight enhanced and refined from the first one and something like a rope meachanic to climb or combat could have easily been a great addition.   \n\nThe less said about Kojima's 2 hr movie endings the better.",

People who want systems of great extrinsic rewards are going to be disappointed with this game.   You have to get intrinsic satisfaction from the adventure itself to enjoy this game.  And I definitely did. I loved every minute of it and couldn't put the game down. It was by far the best game I've ever played.  I'm not the type of person to go on binges with video games. I get fatigue after 2-3 hours. But I was hooked with this title.  One hour would turn into two. Which would turn into four. Next thing you know it's midnight and I haven't eaten dinner.  What is going on?   \n\nI'd set off with a mission where I had a destination but then I would constantly get distracted. That distraction will be to another distraction which would lead to another distraction which would be to another distraction. But the thing is, I would never feel overwhelmed.  The whole thing felt so organic.  And I couldn't put it down until I eventually completed my initial goal.  \n\nAs I said and has been well established, the extrinsic rewards are weak in this title. You beat the shrine and expect some awesome reward for doing so.... You are going to be disappointed. Because all your shit eventually breaks!  This Is something that never bothered me (except with my Hylian Shield, that should've been protected like the Master Sword).  You quickly learn that nothing is sacred.   This is a deeper theme that I've learned in my own life. **Experiences are much more important than material possessions.**\n\nThe people who collect all the Korok seeds and want something awesome for doing so. Well you get shit! [Literally](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQO-ksCNsOwORT-1aHlAWLBCQ_oWFDWIYh0jg&amp;usqp=CAU)!\n\nI'm not saying it's not a flawed game. It is in many ways. I definitely missed the various Zelda items from the past. That signature progression.  When I first left the Great plateau, I remember thinking... so I'm not going to get anything else?  Huh. \n\nI wanted more dungeons. Enemy variety was too low. I wanted more grand compositions. The side quests were a bit fetchy and not great (although the shrine quests were a great and often overlooked aspect of the game...) Even full climbing gear didn't mitigate the pain that was climbing in the rain. I could go on and on. \n\nBut I love this game in spite of those flaws because of what it did so well, it's the only game to have ever done it.  It had me absolutely hooked I'm like any other game I've played in my life. \n\nWhen I grew up I used to spend hours in Hyrule Field of Ocarina of Time just fucking around trying to play the game trying to outsmart the game. I used to always try to think outside of the box trying to find a unique to solve the puzzles. Trying to go places the game didn't want me to go. It always disappointed me that my solutions didn't work even if they would be feasible from a logical perspective. Because I had to think in the *game's* logic. The developer's logic. It broke my immersion. Made the game feel fake. Revealed it for the polygons and pixels and computer code it actually was.  The openness of Hyrule Field in OOT was amazing at the time and I can't tell you how much time I'd ride Epona and jump fences, but you get to a point and realize it's really just a clever mirage. There wasn't really that much going on.  \n\nHalf-Life 2 introduced physics and that was so cool to me. I loved fucking around with the gravity gun. Until this day the physics in that game are still some of the most impressive there are. But even so, there was only so much you could do and usually outside of solving the puzzle you needed to solve to continue, these physics were just for a show.   \n\nBut with Breath of the Wild... When that game came it blew HL2 out of the water. The physics engine was capable of so much. It actually allowed you to break the game but you weren't breaking it you were just playing it. You couldn't break it! This is what it *wanted* you to do. Every puzzle had multiple solutions. The developers didn't even think of all the possible solutions for all the puzzles.  Hell, they didn't even think of all of the puzzles.  You could create your very own scenarios for how to get up a mountain, traverse terrain, defeat a group of enemies, etc.  \n\nI loved this. Finally an action adventure game with a narrative where my out of the box thinking was encouraged. Where I didn't have to do things like the developers wanted me to do them. Were my solutions COULD be feasible. I would spend hours on YouTube looking at all the crazy shit that people came up with. I still do this and I'm so surprised that all the stuff that I've never thought of that people do in this game. How did the developers possibly create a such a dynamic game? It's seriously like a living and breathing organism. Every experience is so unique. \n\nThere's really just nothing else out there like it. \n\nNintendo knew damn well that they were abandoning a lot of Zelda conventions. But before it was released a lot of people felt that the Zelda franchise was growing stale. Read Game Spots review of skyward sword for the Wii. That was the sentiment a lot of people had. They needed to do something to shake things up. This was Nintendo's crown jewel. The Wii U is failing. Nintendo was known to be the fucking best of the best. If this next Zelda failed, the long adage that Nintendo was doomed might actually come true.  But BOTW showed what they are made of. It was a completely revolutionary title. \n\nI really have never understood the complaints where people say that it is empty.   There are engaging puzzles everywhere. And I love puzzles in games.   Just traversing around and getting from point A to B was a blast. Initially figuring out how to get around was so much fun. At first you had to rely on cooking but then eventually you got gear to make it easier and easier. I was so immersed in the wilderness. Every Korok puzzle I was excited for. Every shrine. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier,  loved the **shrine quests** to actually unlock some of the shrines -- instead of using GPS style way points like modern games you'd get a clue and have to use your own head and puzzle solving skills to solve the puzzle to unearth the shrine from the Earth. Games like the Witcher 3 or RDR2, I feel like you just follow the arrow and do exactly as the game tells you to do and play out a script. I don't like this type of gameplay.  I want player agency and BOTW let me live out my own adventures and figure out everything on my own.  \n\nPlaying the Witcher 3 after BOTW felt so limiting. Invisible walls everywhere. I couldn't interact with the world; it was all mostly just art to look at except for things that had context prompts. I couldn't climb things. It was so story heavy and I'm really not into huge stories and video games. I'm looking for a cinematic experience I will watch a movie.  I play games to play. It's gameplay was just nothing I haven't done before.  \n\nI've always preferred vibe to cinematics in games as a way of story . Great music, artwork, etc. I hate nonstop cutscenes when I just want to play the damn game.  Growing up I was always the type of person that would just mash A through long narratives because I just wanted to be in control of my character. This is why I love games like Half Life 2 and Earthbound so much. So much of those games stories are gathered passively by the player by astute observation rather than force fed through long text box and/or cutscenes.   I like games that feel unique in this regard and games like the Witcher or Skyrim just feel like another LOTR high fantasy clone.  \n\nI definitely hope they mix what they started with Breath of the Wild and start finding ways to incorporate traditional Zelda back into the formula. But as of right now it was the best game and experience I've ever had. The most immersive because the deep interaction and intrinsic rewards throughout the game. I was able to interact and become immersed with this title like I never thought was possible. The freedom and interactivity is mind blowing and I continue to discover new things about this game to this day.  \n\nOne thing that I find normal about Breath Of The Wild is that I actually remember a lot of my experience with this game pretty in depth.  A lot of games I find that after I beat them my memories of the game become vaguer as time goes on. Sometimes it all comes back if I replay it, but I often can't recall the experience from memory.  But with this one I can.   It was my own journey and nobody else experienced it like I did.  It feels like part of my actual life rather than media I consumed.",

This approach of \"hey we just released a game, go on and try it\" is something that just wouldn't be possible without it being on a service like Game Pass (because the alternative is a bloated free to play filled with microtransactions).\n\nHi-Fi Rush is a game that I thought I would never see being released in 2023, it feels like it belongs in the PlayStation 2 era in the best way possible, and I'm hopeful we will see more and more games like this in the future thanks to subscription services making this possible and helping AA developers to get more visibility.\n\nThe future of gaming is looking bright again.",

        "text": "This little analysis/ a bit of a rant was inspired by an article i read recently about the upcoming Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy, in which the developers stated that they didn't want to \"prevent the player from being evil\" by basically saying that aside from NPC reactions you won't get any significant consequences if you decide to do evil/good actions. Their reasoning was that they didn't want the player to feel limited by punishing them for being evil. And it is my firm belief that this kind of thinking about morality/choices in videogames is not only incorrect, it's incredibly reductive\n\nConsequences and choices go hand in hand. You can't have one and not have the other. Even if it's something minute and unimportant like which toilet stall you pick at a public bathroom, there's still consequences. In videogames however, especially in games that market themselves on choices this should be even more prevalent. \n\nOne of the reasons why i and many others enjoy doing the evil route in videogames is precisely because of the consequences of the decisions we're making. Could you imagine if in say, New Vegas you decided to side with the Legion yet the game just didn't make the NCR hostile towards you or, worse yet, still allowed you to pursue their missions. That would be absolutely ridiculous and it would detract from why i was going with the Legion run anyways: to go up against the NCR. Same thing with the Mass Effect trilogy. What fun would i get doing the renegade options if there were no (downright game changing by Mass Effect 3) consequences for my actions. If you want the choices in your game to be impactful, there has to be consequences for them, even if they're minute. Otherwise you're left with a Telltale games situation",

There are also rhythm games designed as an interactive way to enjoy music.\n\n•**Writing:** Story and character writing mostly.

Certainly they are useful and can be fun.\n\nBut my question is more around how the act of rating a game affects your personal experience of a game both while playing and retrospectively.  Does it distort how you feel about a game?  Does it cheapen an emotional experience to quantify it?  Does it make completion feel more meaningful if you can attach a score to your time spent?

Hard difficulty can mean crank up enemy damage by X%, lower player damage by Y% (hello Skyrim), it being properly thought out matters a lot here, because hard does not automatically equal fun, it needs to be well designed and push the player into engaging with as many of the games mechanics as possible without feeling like a load of bullshit.",

        "text": "Looking back at the past five-or-six-ish years (essentially from the launch of the Nintendo Switch), I've noticed how effortless online multiplayer has really become. It's been a thing to some extent since the Dreamcast era (what, Phantasy Star Online and Quake 3, if I recall?), but it hasn't truly become prevalent until the launch of Rocket League in 2016, and far more prominently, the Minecraft: Better Together update and Fortnite's Battle Royale mode in late 2018.\n\nI think it's a part of modern gaming that goes very unappreciated - it's very much one of those things that you don't notice until it's gone. The last non-indie game that I've played and noticed it doesn't have cross-play is the re-release of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, a very rude awakening once I tried to convince a friend to get it on Steam so I could play with them through my Switch.\n\nApart from that, I've played matches of Minecraft with my younger cousins using the Switch while my brother uses his own Windows machine, had quick Fortnite matches with Discord friends stuck on Playstation, and matched up in lobbies with buddies who were using copies of their games they got off of Xbox Game Pass or Epic while I was playing on Steam. Not having to buy multiple versions of a game (or even whole consoles!) to have the *privilege* of queueing up on a couple quick match of whatever game strikes our fancy is something I don't envy from the pre-2017 era.\n\nWhat are other subtle advancements to that tune that have helped improve the state of gaming over the past half-decade (ish)? Any other predictions for changes to this tune that are yet to come? Personally *(and in a bold, ill-advised guesstimation)*, I'd bet we're gonna see console exclusivity's slow, grueling death in the coming years. Not completely, of course — some games will always be stranded on one console due to technical issues, brand appeal, exclusive control methods or if you're Nintendo — but we're already seeing this with Playstation games coming to Steam, Xbox ex-exclusives appearing on the Switch and so forth. I wouldn't be surprised if in the future, Playstation Plus becomes a service with local PC games similar to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and full-on console exclusives go from the hundreds per generation to the tens.",

The enemies in second half do way too much damage and the bosses feel like have sekiro move set while I am being forced to use ds3 move set . \n\nMan the open world just sucks , it’s too large with not much to do , it just isn’t interesting. The combat feels good in first half of game but it just sucks balls in second half especially if you refuse to use magic or mimic tear . \n\nAlso the bosses are repeated multiple times and i just don’t get it , it adds nothing to the experience and makes the game feel even more bloated\n\nThe storytelling is also dogshit , you are expected to read all item descriptions and listen to all character dialogues and interpret the story in a way that makes sense to you or you know go watch vaatividya story videos and understand from his interpretation of story . For fucks sake sekiro which released before elden ring has better storytelling . We need to evolve towards better story telling and not evolve away from it .\n\nSo if someone liked Elden ring can you please tell me what part of it you liked and why did you even like it ? For me this game is average at best , I really wish they didn’t go openworld route for Elden ring .",

        "text": "Normally I wouldn't come out to share a negative opinion of an indie game, but wow, the discussion around this game is really one-sided to unabashed positivity. I have just a ton of negative stuff to say, so here's the TLDR, then the wall of text.\n\nTLDR: The game is a series of poorly written self-contained stories that happen to your character. The world never feels real, your character never shows agency, and the NPCs are written with the worst tropes of anime in mind.\n\nHow does capitalism look in the future, and how does it dehumanize the individual more than it already does? Can someone overcome systematic dehumanization to become a person in their own eyes and the eyes of those around them? These are the foundational questions of Citizen Sleeper, a visual novel and light RPG released in 2022. The game slips you into the frame of the eponymous Sleeper, a type of robot with a person's intelligence grafted into it. You awake in a rundown space station with little memory of your human life or the world around you. From this blankish slate, you must forge your path, meet interesting characters, make friends, and define what it means to be your own person.\n\nWhile that is the story's intention, unfortunately, it falls well short of its goals. At 6 hours of playtime and 8 hours, if you're a completionist, the story has neither the time nor writing quality to express its ideas, nor does it allow you to express your own ideas. Despite the story's central theme of trying to explore taking agency of your life and expressing your humanity, the player has almost zero agency in the story and will often be told how they are supposed to feel (the game tells you that you feel betrayed by an npc withholding information instead of letting you decide if the npc was justified or not). The story of this game is linear and does not allow player expression; 95% of the game is the same for all players. This game is labeled and priced like a light RPG but is closer to a visual novel.\n\nThroughout the game, you encounter several characters. You will usually meet these characters after filling up a progress bar for work in or exploration of an area. Most of these characters will ask you to engage in work grinds or fetch quests to advance their story. Once you've done enough of their task to fill up another progress bar, that character's story will develop, and the NPC will tell you what to do next. You are usually given two options for responding to these requests: yes or passive-aggressive yes' and rarely will you receive a third option, 'tell me more about X.' Think of Fallout 4's 'yes,' sarcastic 'yes,' 'yes but pay me more,' or 'no for now' and how much flak that game got for it and then realize that Citizen Sleeper is even more limited.\n\nIn fact, the majority of choices in this game are an illusion. You can sometimes flee/fight an assailant or stop and allow them to harass you. These options are always an illusion; if you run or fight, your character will fail, suffer some harm, and then be harassed in the same way that would have occurred had you not tried to resist. For some reason, this game only punishes you for trying to show agency.\n\nYou can also never express agency by asking a character to help you with anything outside that character's specific questline (i.e. you can't ask the mercenary to help you with the bounty hunter). This makes the game feel more like a collection of self-contained stories that happen to your character instead of a living world in which your character is engaging.\n\nThe game has six endings: yes or no to three end-game choices. These choices will be the same for all players, and you can come to all three choices in one playthrough. Your choice is a binary 'yes' or 'no' without nuance as to how your character feels about the choice or if they can modify the presented conditions. You are also not allowed to ask questions about the options being offered. For instance, two endings are options to leave the station, but you are not allowed to ask how you will access the scarce drug your character needs to survive.\n\nThe gameplay, too, fails to enliven the world or provide agency to the player. Your character has five skills rated from -1 to +2; you will use these skills to manage three resources: Condition, Energy, and Actions. Condition serves as your health every day it will decrease by one, and as it gets lower, you can take fewer actions in a day. Condition can only be recovered with an expensive item or inefficient perk. Energy is similar to stamina, negative outcomes from tests will usually cost energy and if you have no energy you will lose Condition on a one-for-one basis. Energy is recovered by spending money or actions. Actions are what allow you to complete tasks and are your most important resource; at the beginning of a day your available actions are assigned a number between one-to-six, the higher the number the higher the likelihood of a positive outcome (a one is 50/50 negative or neutral outcome, while a six is guaranteed a positive outcome).\n\nThese three resources create an economy where you should be forced to deliberate how you spend these resources for money, supplies, and story progress. However, they are not balanced. The average player will have enough resources and momentum within thirty minutes to make it through the game without difficulty. The fault here stems from the stat system and how they interact with the action dice\n\nStats, one of your five stats will start at -1, one starts at +1, and the rest are set to 0. Each stat has two perks and two increases which cost between 1-3 upgrade points. The modifiers affect the action dice that you are assigning to a test, e.g. if you have a +1 in Engineering, than assigning an action dice of 2 will give you the outcomes of an action dice of 3. This system breaks very quickly.\n\nIf you average all the dice results for a +0 stat, you will have a result of 25% negative, 37.5% neutral, and 37.5% positive. For a +1 stat this increases to 17% negative, 29% neutral, and 54% positive. Lastly a +2 stat will give you 8% negative, 21% neutral, and 71% positive. Not only are these outcomes incredibly generous for a dystopian game about scraping by for survival as an outcast but also you will know these outcomes at the beginning of your day. You can easily assign your dice in such a way as to trivialize any risks from a low number. Worse, one of the stat perks will completely destroy even this trivial risk.\n\nPerks in this game are whack. The worst offender allows you to reroll all your actions once per day, so that you can spend all of your good actions and reroll your weak ones. Some perks give you free money or items for doing a task of that stat; therefore stacking rewards allowing you to get money or scrap without spending actions. Other perks allow you to spend actions for energy, which is really inefficient, or allow you to see possible outcomes of a task that you can usually intuit on your own 95% of the time. So perks are either worthless or game-breaking.\n\nSo this game has no agency, no challenge, and copious ham-fisted writing; why is it in so many end-of-year lists as a game of the year contender?",

        "text": "Controversial opinion maybe, but Red Dead 2 is probably the best boring game out there.\n\nI bought the game at a discount recently after hearing such high praise for the title. \"Best game ever\". \"There's not enough words why its so good\". \"Cured my cancer\". 14 hourse later and I have basically completely dropped it. I don't take pride in bashing it as it is a marvel in production qualities. It's a level of detail and scale that only an industry giant like Rockstar could produce. \n\nMy issues with it are such:\n\n* **Its too slow.** \n   * It felt like I was always playing to find \"the fun\", just waiting for me around the corner. Like the weekend at the end of a long week. I just had to keep playing but the \"weekend\" never came. That's basically my entire experience in a nutshell.\n* **The story isn't interesting.** \n   * This is where I'll probably lose a lot of people, but I really didn't care about anything that was happening. I feel like the story lacks a narrative base, a fundamental \"why\". There is a \"why\", that being the failed boat heist. However, the game puts you more or less in the middle of the story, post boat heist. The game asks for a lot of investment from the player into the story without being interesting.\n* **A lack of fundamental player agency and gameplay depth**.\n   * There's a significant divide between story missions and the open world, that being the degree to which you can make interesting decisions that affect gameplay. The story missions have a very tight leash. Don't do explicitly as told, and you get janked back to checkpoint. This is fundamentally boring to me. Couple that with a narrative I don't care about, and it feels like my time is being wasted.\n\nI would describe Red Dead 2 as \"self-indulgent\" from a game design perspective. A lot of mechanics and detail make the game more artistic, but don't exist for the player necessarily or make the game \"feel\" better (quiet the opposite in fact). I appreciate that Red Dead 2's is a game that is probably better when played for long sessions at  time. I just don't have the time for that at the moment. When I play games, I want to unwind and have fun. A heavy focus on narrative to the detriment of gameplay is the opposite of what I value in a game.\n\nSo what do you think? I imagine a lot of you do like Red Dead 2 and don't mind the pacing. When do you think that games go too far when it comes to narrative over gameplay.",

        "text": "In the early days of cinema and especially when \"talkies\" (movies with sound) started becoming the norm, movies from the silent era began to very rapidly become lost. The business oriented movie industry treated these works of art like a can of riced beans - a disposable and fleeting commodity to be consumed once and then tossed. Countless silent masterpieces became irreparably damaged in poor and neglectful storage spaces, many were simply destroyed, others had their reels reused for \"talkies\" and many proved very flammable and actually caught fire.\n\nAnyways enough of the movie talk. The video game industry seems to treat any old game (I'm referring mostly to computer games here), especially those released before 2000-2005 as a silent movie. Something that is in most cases forgotten, buried, and unsupported. Basically abadonware. These products of entertainment may as well be the video game equivalent of \"lost\" silent movies. Even though I assume the \"master copy\" of the these games is probably rotting on some Epic Games' executive's external hard drive, the game is still technically lost because its likely never to see the light of day again as the original developer will never release rights to a third party dealer to sell the game legitimately preferring to just sit on it for eternity until it probably truly does become \"lost\" like a \"lost\" silent movie.\n\nI know there's GOG and Steam does a good job of supporting and selling old games, but there needs to be an even more comprehensive overhaul of how the video game industry treats old software/games. There needs to be a platform that has all abadonware titles available for legitimate sale. Just like how one can look up countless old movies on streaming platforms with the click of a few buttons one should be able to do just the same for old video games.\n\nWhy does the video game industry treat old computer games like disposable obsolete commodities that are meant to be tossed away and forgotten despite there being a market, however small, that loves them very dearly? I recall hearing how Cliff Blezinski and his colleauges worked 14 hour days on Unreal 1 and Unreal Tournament 1. It was a passion project as much as it was a pursuit to make a profitable product. How can you bury something so beloved by a community and most of all how could you do so knowing how much work you yourself put into it?\n\nI so very much want to play Prey (2006), The Thing, and No One Lives Forever but they are all abandonware.... Good thing I already bought Unreal 1 and UT99 GOTY edition years ago on Steam, but  I still worry Epic Games will come after this and try to make it not work or something",

Several gadgets can effortlessly end combat encounters in literal seconds, in stealth the game will quite literally just tell you when an enemy is guaranteed safe to take down at zero risk, and most of all the swinging has almost nothing to it.\n\nWhat I mean by that last part is that beyond the initial hype of swinging around quickly through a really beautiful New York with great animations, the swinging has very little meat to it. Outside of a few moments throughout the campaign you're almost never at any risk when swinging. No one can chase you, very few enemies can shoot you and those that can are avoidable with a quick time event, you can slam straight into buildings or fall straight to the streets and you're fine. All you're really left with is the intrinsic motivation of trying to make your route look cool, which works but there's not enough style options to traversal to make that worth another playthrough.\n\nI want to be clear this isn't really a difficulty rant. I'm not looking for the next Spiderman game to be this extremely punishing brutality ride where Spiderman breaks his ribs if you don't get out of the way of the empire state building or something. But I'd like some sort of option that makes me think about my swinging more than I do now. Like, I can't be the only one who feels that what makes Spiderman's swinging so inherently cool and exhilarating in the comics or movies is the fact that he *can* fuck up, and if he does he *will* just faceplant onto the windows of a building. The fact that he doesn't makes it impressive.",

        "text": "Now I am very happy to be proven wrong and get educated on the matter, but, my initial impression is, I have this sense and feeling that we're getting milked. Has gaming development time on average really increased that much? One similar pattern I continue to see, is never ending mismanagement, which tends to delay games and increase development time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow often do games get crunched in the final 2 years to meet release dates now? Tonnes of articles. The tools for development have also made workflow easier, as well as the fact that, maybe management should priorities their budgets better, instead of wasting it on things like, I dunno, paying celebs to feature in your game or voice them. Its ridiculous because most facial cap is still not that good to alleviate the emotional stiffness you see in games. So, what is the point of paying for actors, that will never be able to truly convey full emotional range?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, my main issue is this. Now that you're taken advantage, increased prices during the cross gen phase, the reality you've created it, buyers will be very stringent with purchases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, purchases will only go towards games that score high, no one is taking a chance on a 6-8 type of game anymore, where as in the past, you would take the gamble as the cost was not as prohibitive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like alot of companies will suffer, already, Callisto Protocol got nowhere near breaking even on its investment. In hindsight I see why, they clearly cared, but, seemed to give too much care to small detials instead of the core experience. Previously, you would still buy the game to make your own mind up, but, because games are 70$ ( which is asking soo much from your consumer base ) no one will waste their time with something that doesnt live up to value.\n\nNow sure, id imagine some will say, prices drop after a month, but thats not the point.\n\nNot every experience can or even should be 9-10, alot of our memories gaming, came from playin mid games and finding something we liked and attached ourselves too. \n\nIt feels like peak greed, will cost a lot of the industry this gen, for me its a disgrace, the prices are too prohibitive.",

Uncharted is a good example, and PS exclusives in general. Movement feels locked. You can only go where we tell you, you can only climb the **always** marked ledge, and you HAVE to see our awesome 4k realistiX face animations for hours. See these graphics, see them?\n\nHow did that happen? It's very disappointing. Few gems like DOOM or Dark souls come out, but not many from AAA. Do people really like this?

Never spent any money on it, mainly because I have none and probably wouldn't anyway even if I did, having a bizarrely high, Josh Strife Hayes-level resistance to the buttons game design nowadays likes to push to exploit your FOMO.\n\nSomewhat recently, a friend of mine on DFO pointed out that, at the end of the day, [Chinese whales with more money than sense](https://www.reddit.com/r/DFO/comments/cs58ks/popular_cdnf_stream_asked_how_much_he_spent_on/?st=jzhnkcic&amp;sh=dd560bce) are going to be funding your play time whether you like it or not. I *think* the implication was that even as an F2P player, I'm indirectly supporting that sort of exploitation merely by playing DFO (or really, any live service game) to begin with. I'm wondering now if they were reading too much into it, or there really is some sort of moral conundrum that I should be at least vaguely aware of.\n\nIf someone tried a similar argument on me back when my gaming \"vice\" was beatmaniaIIDX and Guilty Gear, which released half-step sequels so often they make sports games and Ubisoft franchises look charitable by comparison, I'd 100% agree and immediately take the L. I'm not entirely sure if this argument works as a completely F2P player though, as I'm not throwing any money at \"the problem\", although I don't disagree that someone else is doing it in my stead.",

        "text": " \n\nI was an early tester for a game I think I may have heard about in this sub - [Betwixt: The Story of You](https://www.betwixt.life/). It’s a choose-your-own-adventure story that gets you to face yourself while you’re trying to find your way out of a strange world called the In-Between. I wanted to share my thoughts on this game because I think it’s breaking new ground that has nothing to do with special effects and the like. \n\nThe devs recently shared that research showed 30% lower levels of stress and depression after a 2-week play and the National Health Service in the UK is going to sponsor two studies to look at the game’s therapeutic potential. This is hugely exciting for the games industry obviously, but what I find especially cool is that the game felt like a game, and not a gamified therapy app. I loved the story and the vibe, which reminded me of Myst and Riven, and I liked two twists on traditional interactive stories:  \n   \n \\- you can write your own responses (and it does reasonably well there, with some obvious limitations that can be overcome with better AI)  \n   \n \\- the grand puzzle you’re solving is yourself and every chapter gives you a different piece of the whole.\n\nThe above meant that with a relatively simple stack and no pyrotechnics, Betwixt created for me an experience that felt uniquely personal. It also got me thinking about the specific aspects of gameplay in general that could make games promising as mental health/wellbeing tools. Here’s what I came up with:  \n   \n \\- It was easier to lower my guard and open up about things I wouldn’t normally discuss, because it was just a game, make-believe  \n   \n \\- As the hero of the story, it didn’t feel “right” to avoid my monster and I was even curious to confront it   \n   \n \\- Games are sufficiently low-stakes, so I felt free to explore new perspectives on my issues, without getting defensive \n\nI’ll stop before this turns into a novel, but I just wanted to share my thoughts with you because I feel like there’s so much potential in this medium and we’re just scratching the surface of it. Betwixt reminded me that there’s a lot we can do with games – and progress doesn’t always mean adding more and more special effects. ",

        "text": "I love detective/investigation games, but, I find that a lot of them fall short of what I consider to be a real representation of the genre, a lot of times a game is billed as a detective game despite being a combination of a game about a mystery that relies too much on puzzle-solving/visual novel or exploration mechanics. Here's my list of where games succeed and fail at being true detective games and a few that I consider actual detective games. Note that none of this implies that the games I list are bad.  \n\n\n**What I'm looking for:**  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Prompts*: Being told to do something explicitly to progress, it's a small negative aspect but is often required, an ideal detective game would only allow you to take notes in game, keep track of what you've found, at the very most it would let you know that you found everything in an area to prevent frustration.  \n\nBad- \"Go here\", \"Do this\".\n\nBetter- \"Ehhh, the next clue is around here somewhere's\".\n\nBadabing- \"I ain't sayin nothin else, but, you found everything in the spooky cabin\".\n\nBest- \"I ain't sayin' nothing, I don't even need to tell you you found everything in the spooky cabin, you already know\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Deductions*:  Anything that requires the player to logically piece together something\n\nBad- The game makes some or all of them for you, or a character provides too many hints.\n\nBetter- You make the deductions yourself but the game prompts you to do so.\n\nBadabing- You explore leads and ideas inside the game without being prompted heavily to do so.  \n\nBest- You explore leads and ideas inside the game without being prompted heavily and you explore some leads outside of the game with your own research (While being somewhat prompted to do so to prevent frustration).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Content*: The quality of the mystery.\n\nBad- The butler did it, aliens did it, Some guy you've never met did it, anything that can be compared to Scooby-Doo.\n\nMeh- The butler/Aliens/Scooby-Doo/Some guy did it and it makes sense why they did it.  \n\nBetter-  Big ass conspiracy but there's no way they did it but it turns out now you know they did it and you know why. \n\n\"They\" did \"It\", \"They\" being a metaphor, philosophy, symbol, object or a group of people that represent a metaphor, philosophy, symbol or object and \"It\" being an inevitability, a necessary evil, a mistake, or a masterful plan, But it's pretentious.\n\nBest- \"They\" did \"it\", It's not pretentious.   \n\n\nBadabing- \n\n**Nah**\n\nAI: The Somnium Files: A visual novel about a mystery with very light puzzle elements.\n\nDarkside Detective:  A point and click adventure game.\n\nImmortality: Watch FMV's and click on prop's to see more FMV's, reverse footage for spookiness. (It's actually a bad game)\n\nDisco Elysium:  Point and Click mystery game where you select skills and roll dice.\n\nHeavy Rain:  A mystery themed visual novel with QTE's.\n\nParadise Killer:  A mystery themed exploration/visual novel/puzzle solving collectathon, deductions are either not required or handed to you outright.\n\nZero Escape 1&amp;2: Escape room puzzle solving surrounding a mystery.\n\nZero Escape 3: Escape room puzzle solving surrounding a mystery in which a guy you've never met who's name is Scooby-Doo and looks like an alien butler did it and it's pretentious and bad.  \n\n\n**Almost**\n\nDetective Grimoire/Tangle Tower:  A point and click adventure/puzzle game with some deductions to be made.  \n\nHer Story/Telling Lies:  Has the building blocks for a detective game doesn't get there in the end.\n\nDanganronpa:  Primarily a visual novel, very close, evidence is unmissable, deductions are sometimes made for you upon spotting a contradiction. rarely, there are some goofy leaps in logic that only make sense to the developers.\n\nPhoenix Wright:  (I'm sorry) Same as above\n\nL.A. Noire:  It has all the elements of a detective game, this one teeters on the edge but it relies too heavily on using mocap to simulate lies. Combat is fun but not what we're looking for.\n\n**Yeh**\n\nUnheard:  Barely a yeh, explicit deductions have to be made, but with lots of prompting and a bit short on content.\n\nSherlock Holmes Crimes &amp; Punishments: Deductions are made with evidence and in solving the case. Most of it is prompted slightly but it's hard to brute force a correct answer.\n\nThe Case of the Golden Idol:  Lots of prompting but the entire game is about making deductions and it's very difficult to brute force it with guesses.  \n\n**Hell yeh**\n\nThe Painscreek Killings: You have to follow up on leads yourself without prompting, very pen and paper kinda game. The final deduction handed to you though.\n\nReturn of the Obra Dinn:  Moderate prompting, but deductions require enough logical thinking to make up for it.\n\nOuter Wilds:  There are prompts but they serve mostly to keep you from thinking you missed something, deductions made require you to explore leads on your own, you're sometimes told where to go. \"They\" did \"It\", It's not pretentious.",

But, I wanna talk about his mobile game that caused him to be striked 3 times by Nikocado Avocado (yup) to getting Kracc's whole channel deleted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story started around December 2022, when Kracc Bacc partnered up with Influencer Apps to create a mobile meme game, known as Avocado Bulk: the game was meant to be a infinite runner game, just as you see in these cringy games that come out on phones, while you play as Nikocado Avocado, gaining weight and being bulkier through Takis (weird, but funny). I have it on my phone, thank God.\n\nAfter that, a few more characters were added, or: Steroid King (a pun on Liver King, which used steroids), Hank (from Breaking Bad) and The Stone (a pun on The Rock). But then, he started making cash through ads, which was a mistake nonetheless. After that, things would change for the worse for Kracc Bacc.\n\nNikocado's manager messaged Influencer Apps kindly to delete the game off any online stores, and they had to do so. In a reply to a comment on Kracc's community post, Kracc Bacc claimed that he should've been more careful with creating the game. But then, some bad stuff happened:\n\nHe gained 2 copyright strikes, and he noted on his Twitter that he's on his last legs and that's not even a bruh moment, but then, the next hour, the final nail in the coffin hit: he gained his third one, causing his whole channel to be deleted. Kracc saw this and sent on Twitter a clip of the Homelander crying. The next hour, he said a statement that he's gonna take a longer than a week break, during which he may or mayn't come back. And the moral of this story is: a million-sub YouTuber making a meme game with a memed celebrity's name is always gonna go wrong.",

This includes single-player games that are no longer available for purchase and multiplayer games where the servers have been shut down.

With games, however, I would estimate that up to 50% of my favorite childhood games are unavailable, and many have been lost forever.  I would expect gaming to be easier than, say, movies or TV in terms of long-term storage, since all but the AAA 3D games usually don’t take up that much disk space relative to videos.  \n\nThis came to my mind recently, as I was creating a list of game recommendations for someone.  When I actually searched for these games, I realized that a large majority of them were defunct and no longer able to be downloaded, purchased, or accessed.  For some, you could even still obtain the game, only to find out that the servers had been permanently shuttered.",

        "author": "LoomyTheBrew",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/10icr9g/aaa_western_game_developers_an_expensive/",
        "text": "So I was listening to my favorite gaming podcast (The Spawn Cast) and they were talking about something intriguing with the state of current western AAA game development that I agreed with.\n\nThe current state of western game development (focusing more on the big boys like EA, Microsoft, Ubisoft, etc.; not the indie side) has the goal of making a giant casino that will last for many years, keep players engaged, and with revenue constantly streaming in. Or if the off chance it's a single player focused game, it's this super graphically intensive game such as Callisto Protocol or Last of Part 2. Each type costs an enormous amount of money like 100m-200m, not including marketing, where the games need to be these massive hits in order to make any profit. In addition, each type takes a very long time to make. But let's contrast that with the 360 generation's output...  \n\n**PS3/360 generation:** \n\nBethesda/Tom Howard - Fallout 3, Oblivion, and Skyrim \n\nBungie - Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo ODST, Halo Reach, and Destiny \n\nNaughty Dog - Uncharted 1, 2, 3, and Last of Us \n\nBioware - Mass Effect 1, 2, 3, and Dragon Age \n\nRockstar - GTA IV, V, and Red Dead 1\n\netc.  \n\nI could go on and on. Basically before the PS4/Xbone era, games released as *games.* There wasn't these huge expectations of graphics or recurring revenue because the development wasn't nearly as expensive nor time consuming. We got more output and the quality was still great. Contrast these same studios with the PS4/Xbone generation...  \n\n**PS4/Xbone:** \n\nBethesda/Tom Howard - Fallout 76 \n\nBungie - Destiny 2 \n\nNaughty Dog - Uncharted 4, Lost Legacy, Last of Us 2 \n\nBioware - Mass Effect Andromeda and Anthem \n\nRockstar - Red Dead 2  \n\nWe've gotten less with the quality arguably staying the same or it being nominally better. In addition, the combined budget of the games I listed under PS4/Xbone probably eclipse the budget of the 360/PS3 titles.   \n\nHowever, Japanese console developers have largely retained the old model (not including mobile which is a shit show, but that's a different discussion). The output and quality from Capcom, Bandai Namco, Koei Tecmo, Square have in some ways increased in both departments. Looking at Capcom.... \n\n**Capcom PS4 generation:**\n\nResident 7, 2, 3, 8, Monster Hunter World and Rise\n\nAll of these games were on PS4/Xbone/Switch within the span of 2017-2022. That's a lot and the quality of those titles are great and I guarantee the budgets are way less inflated than western game titles because they are not using the more advanced graphical tech. Not to mention they've all sold well, which is why we keep on getting them.   \n\nI already know some of you will say Square is a bad example, but I want to point out Square had more than just their AAA side. They had FFXV, FF7R, and Kingdom Hearts 3 that took forever to come out and probably had inflated budgets, but they've had a lot of other stuff like Nier Automata, Octopath, Bravely Default, and Tokyo RPG Factory games to supplement those big releases. A lot of their smaller titles were great and a lot of them found some measure of success.  \n\nThe western studios that I listed above have almost completely killed off their AA games. These western studios all focus on AAA games now that take forever to come out, are expensive, and require in-game monetization to recoup costs. The developers don't just need a game, they need a casino because the technology they are pushing for requires it. \n\n I just don't think this direction western studios have taken will be worth it in the long run. Players are getting less, developers are working harder, and publishers are spending more. There has to be a breaking point. I would rather western studios stop trying to one up each other on the technology and focus back on games that are fun to play without all the strings attached. I don't need to see all the pores on the main character's face, I just need a fun game to play.\n\nAnd let's be real, these games will still look amazing even without the tech. The tech in Horizon Forbidden West is more advanced than Elden Ring with the facial animations and other graphical elements, but Elden Ring still looks fantastic. The graphics do not make *that* big of a difference to the average lay gamer as long as it's good enough. \n\nTo conclude, I think western studios need to look back at their past and reconsider these massive casino games that likely will never hit their expectations. Remember your roots: **fun over tech.** \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI hope people don't think I'm trying to say: big Japanese developers = good, big Western developers = bad. Japanese developers have a lot of their own issues especially on the mobile side and have had some questionable monetization practices in their console games. They just seem closer to the old model of output and game development that we came to expect in the 360 generation and before compared to western developers that seem to be pushing the limits of graphics and technology to some insane levels.\n\nBut what do you all think? I am definitely open to critique of my analysis.",

These were worlds first &amp; games second.\n* The \"golden era\" of MMOs contained 3D MUDs that emphasized at least one of these elements particularly well: Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, EverQuest, &amp; Asheron's Call (..plus several others including Anarchy Online).\n* WoW enters the picture and continues to innovate the genre just like EQ/SWG did before *while still* being tied to its MUDs roots.\n* Post-WoW clones replaced worlds with monetized systems while keeping a similar look &amp; feel.\n* Today, a resurgence is occurring, fostering to those who still are fond of \"MUD based\" MMOs whether through private servers, classic incarnations, or new developments (Embers Adrift, Pantheon, Monsters &amp; Memories, Project Gorgon, et cetera).\n\nHow do you see the rise, fall, and hopeful renaissance of the MMO genre?

But I feel nothing about Fire Emblem Engage and I think the reviewers are praising it  undeservedly:\n\n**Lack of innovation on story paths**\n\nOne reason I like the Fire Emblem for is they bring interesting story-affecting mechanics like Conquest vs Birthright choices, Separate story lines for the Three Houses, etc. FE Engage will have only one story route which feels like a huge downgrade.\n\n**Lack of innovation on supports**\n\nThe CBAS support system is a staple of Fire Emblem, but I feel like it is time to try something new here. Three Houses did that with the gifts and time management. It wasn't a huge difference but it was a difference. There is no new ideas happening here.\n\n**Shallow characters (again)**\n\nFE characters being anime tropes with anime dialogue is a given and has always been there. However, for some characters we get some development and satisfying arcs. From the dialogue fragments I have seen so far it seems there is no innovation happening here too. The support dialogues are still a shallow \"Hey let me help you with X\" or \"You have to believe in yourself\" copy-pasta dialogues. I wish we were able to move a bit past that, have some deeper dialogues and dialogue choices.\n\n**It feels like DLC**\n\nThe similar visual style and setting, combined with what looks like a generic story makes me feels this game is more of a DLC with mechanic tweaks than actually a new FE game. Sure it might be a competent game for someone who has never played FE before but I'm not sure it deserves all the hype when it barely feels like a separate game.",
