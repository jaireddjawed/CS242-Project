        "text": " \n\nI'm no writer; however this story demands that I try. To let you know me better, here is a quick recap of me. I'm not special in any way; I have never been the best at anything.. or real hobbies.. other than a cold drink after a shift in my local store. Being in my mid twenties, I'd have to say that I'm doing rather well for myself. I live in a one-bedroom apartment with the company of a half-full fridge. Some may say that I seem to be depressed, but that never haunts my thoughts. I like the simplicity of my life. No vivid surprises, no relationship problems, just me and my head. Yes, sometimes I get sad or lonely, but my philosophy is that I do not have to be happy. I can endure it, so why not help those who cannot? This was the flaw in my story. You see, I realised that I just lied to myself about being as good as I'd like to believe. But that is for later. Lastly, even if I'm scared, even if I cant go on, I'm happy. Do not think of me as someone who promotes this, but hell, it seems as the only solution. I am happy.\n\nThe story starts as many do, on an ordinary day. I worked a long shift, 14 hours behind the counter, on the first day of my long weekend. It was nothing special, just the boredom of being alone in the store. Customers showing up for a minute and leaving with hours apart. This was going to be a slow weekend. It doesn't matter. Just 8 more hours and I can go home. I just spend my time there like any other worker in customer service: watching shitposts on different apps. The posts repeat themselves. For some reason, even those stupid AI art spams did not stop. Why are people flooding everyone's feed with this moronic stuff is just above me. But we watch it either way.. the most intelligent creatures.. Am I right? As closing time crawled nearer, I noticed a few weird things. Nothing like ghosts in the corners of my eyes. More in the realm of weather, getting almost 10 degrees colder, 5 inside of the store, rising fog and such. Yeah, that's normal during winter in my town, but now, with hindsight, it should have been my first warning.\n\nNear the end of my shift, a mom came into the store with her small daughter. Maybe 7 years old; however, I'm dismal at guessing the age of someone. Think of the start of the annoying age for children. That was her. Running curiously from aisle to aisle, while her mom slowly browsed for things she wanted to buy. Finally, they met in a snack aisle, where the daughter asked \"how many can I have?\". That's when I returned to my shitposts and stopped paying attention to them.\n\nShortly after they left with some sweets and other necessities, I noticed a small glove on the ground. As I went over to get it, I realised that it belonged to the little girl. I could still see them at a bus stop waiting for a bus if I looked down the street from the front window. I could have quickly locked the shop and went to give it back to them; but I did not. Well, sure, it's their stuff and their problems, but when you want to be someone that saves the world, this is the least difficult thing you can do. I did not do it. Maybe it is from my overthinking, but the glove still haunts me. I could have done it. I could have been a good person, but I wasn't. Surely they would realise that the glove is missing, and return to get it, right?\n\nAs I closed the shop, I was yet again thinking about the glove and those two. This is where I saw myself and my behavior as it was. Bad, just bad. With my philosophy, it is quite funny, right? \"Well, nothing to do now\", I thought to myself and started to dream about a beer in my fridge and a bed. If they come, I will return it to them, and apologise, maybe make up a lie so they will not see me as I see myself. This began my vow that doomed me. Who wants to see their true self every day? Not me.\n\nMy apartment is about a 20 minutes from the shop by foot, so I put on my headphones and started the march. One last bit about me. I have no idea why I started it, but I find myself listening to ambient sounds, like forest, sea, empty city at midnight (this one is quite ironic, since I'm literally walking through an empty city at midnight) and others. I dont know why, but they are relaxing. They don't pump me up as my preferred music genre, it just relaxes. Today it was the sounds of the forest. So, with chilled fingers, I scrolled until I found a live stream of a forest with sounds of animals. While walking, the sound of a slight cry or a howl was sometimes heard in the background. Crows, and squirrels, and crickets and other stuff, I cannot name, it was blissful. This is when it happened. The beginning. Walking and enjoying the sounds and the silence of the street, disrupted only by the animal sounds or a car passing by, was the best medicine. The fog helped me to feel safe, even though it started to fade. Each step is followed by another. As I was walking, now only about 5 minutes from my bed, the howl sounded. Right in my left ear, a mere centimeter away. Louder than a passing car, as if specially for me to notice. This left me stunned.. frozen. Too scared to move. Until finally looking around myself, nothing, just me, and an empty street.\n\n\"Some asshole put this in the ambient sounds to scare people\" was my first rational thought. Still slightly frightened, I laughed to myself. I knew these types of videos. I'd met them before, but just didn't expect it. Fun. A new step restarted my journey. Quickly meeting the oval glass building serving as a gatehouse for my block of apartments. Looking at the stretched out and twisted image of myself when walking past it. \"Finally, home.\" I sighed. Opening the fridge and having a beer was the first need of mine. Here I realised my original quest. No beer. \"Fuck, have to do it tomorrow\".Â \n\nThe next day was as uneventful as the previous one; slow, boring, and obnoxiously long. Spent my time looking at the same three apps as every day: looking at the reposts from yesterday. Minding my own business. Cleaning and doing the necessary tasks to keep my sanity intact, or at least sane-ish. The mom did not come for the glove. Further deepening my weird misery about it.\n\nNear the evening and closing time, a man came in. Opening the shop door, triggering the little bell and letting in the cold winter air with the mist seeping in. He started to look at the liquor. Browsing it for more than comfortable, I reminded myself of the glove. \"I hate myself. Gotta help those in need\" were the thoughts running through my mind as I put down my phone. \"Need any help?\" I asked. \"Yeah, my girlfriend has a birthday, any recommendations?\" He replied \"Well, I found out that a plush toy and a vine does the trick.\" Said I. \"Hmm.. yeah, she could go for that, thanks.\" Was the last sentence he said to me before the transaction. After choosing the cheapest, yet fanciest looking bottle and a cliche Teddy bear, the work ended and the closing time came.\n\nLocking the door was the first time I saw the fog covering me, like a blanket made out of chilled air, now much thicker. \"Hm, spooky night.\" I said, and for some reason decided to put on the same stream as yesterday. It plays into the idea of a scary atmosphere, where even if I know a spook is coming, I do not know when. Looking up the stream, I found out that it was now a 3 hour long video. Not knowing when I started to listen to the stream yesterday, I played it from the beginning. \"This pushes the unknown more, maybe I won't get scared toda-\" the thought was interrupted by a sudden howl, now in my right ear, giving me a little fright. \"This guy put in a multiple of these. Cheeky\" I thought.\n\nThe walk, of now 10 minutes, was accompanied by a howl or a cry, from afar, slowly getting closer and closer. \"Maybe it was like yesterday, now I'm just focusing on it more\". That could have been a possibility. Now it was not that spooky. I could expect it. Coming closer and closer to my left side, I awaited the loud cry. Nothing happened for a minute. Awaiting it, stopping my step, a speeding car drove past my left side. Not gonna lie to you, I almost shat myself. Not that I did not expect anything, but I focused on the silence and on the now well-known cry, that I had completely forgotten about the passing cars. Funny coincidence, right? Shortly after I calmed myself, almost as a joke, I heard the howl on my right side far behind me. It became too weird and too spooky, so I walked in silence for the rest of the walk. Coming home, I cursed myself. You probably guessed it. I forgot the beer at the shop. Yeah, nothing to do now, but to be beerless for another night.\n\nThe final day of my long week at work began as any other day, with one exception: I wrote the word BEER on my hand to not forget again. Walking to the shop, I kept reminding myself of that reality, vowing that it would be the day, the day I would not forget to buy it. Shortly after coming to the shop, the first thing was to take a sixpack of beer and put it into the employee fridge. Now that my plans were finished, back to work. Opening, cleaning, and preparing for the last day. After everything was done, I yet again returned to the good old faithful memes about corruption, different protests, and controversial topics. Few customers came in and came out like any other day. The only interesting thing was a man. Not that interesting to write about, but when you work in this profession, the sale of the most expensive bottle you have in the shop is something to celebrate. I even sent a photo of the empty space on the shelf to my boss, who laughed and messaged \"Do not drink it all at once\". After that, it was yet another day at the grindstone; a motto of our shop of sorts. The only positive thing about my impending walk home today was the thought of having two days free to myself.\n\nClosing time came quicker today than expected; maybe I was just not paying attention to the dark creeping in because of the fog, yet again thick and absorbing any sign of life outside of the shop. First, locking the doors, and then realising that I had forgotten the beer in the fridge. Yeah, I should not have washed my hands when going out of the toilet. So, shortly after returning to grab it and again locking the door, my march began. During the walk, I was picking out my headphones so I could listen to something on my walk like every night. Today I was in the mood for something more relaxing, maybe something to keep me warm. However, the charge in them got drained shortly after listening to the sounds of a sea on a tropical island. \"Well, it seems like I will have to walk in silence today\" I said to myself. It was quite cold and I could feel my lips getting dry and my eyes watering. When I was putting my hands to my face, so I could exhale into them and warm it, I heard a bawl and a playful bark, as if of a dog in the distance. \"Heh, some monsters do not sleep\" I thought. Â Â Â Â \n\nFinally turning the corner and seeing the oval glass gatehouse of my building, I knew that the sweet and bitter taste of my favorite beverage was close. Looking at myself in the twisting reflection of the glass, studying the bizarre stretched-out torso and arms of myself as any other day. Finally, looking back at the path I was on, I heard it. The howl. The all-familiar cry of my last few nights. Much quieter than those nights. I stopped as if petrified. \"Could it be just my imagination messing with me? Transforming a random sound into the stuff of nightmares?\" It was behind me. My mind raced. \"What was happening? Was it real?\" I scaredly glanced again at the glass and saw a new shape, a second shape behind me. Then a grunt. \"Wait..\" This was the grunt of a woman. \"did I imagine the demon behind me?\" I focused on the second shape, and yes, the proportions were weird, but so were mine. Remembering the vow of helping others in need, I turned around, with the intention of helping. The turn on my heel stopped with fright.. Those.. Those long pale fingers of absurd proportions near my foot were the first thing I noticed. Stopping me.. forcing me to look at the abnormally enlarged and thin hand near my legs. Slowly glaring up at the thin and long arm, it was mesmerizing. Fighting the need to see, I failed and continued upwards. The face.. the pale face of an entity unhuman to any idea of a person.. holes as of an abyss on its face, towering over me. A grin with no mouth and enjoyment in its soulless sockets. This.. made those howls.. those cries. It followed me for days...\n\nI cannot tell you how I escaped. I simply fail to remember anything after that. Only a haze of images of me running and locking the front door. Trembling, I was in my bed with a knife, thinking. A day passed by without having anything to eat or drink, just me and my thoughts. What was it? Was it a hallucination of a bored mind? Was it a dream? But then how could I not have the stomach to check my front door if it was truly locked? Failing to sleep another night, I stared at the crack in the blinds of my window; the fog was present; yet I heard nothing. Today is my last day at home.. safe. What if it was not a dream? The evening was creeping in fast, as if to provoke me. This is why I'm writing it. I managed to get out of bed in a mad haste to check the front door if it was locked. It was. I saw my bag on the floor near it. So, now I'm drinking a warm beer, already on my fifth one. What should I do? Is there anything I can do? If I'm losing my mind, so be it, but please don't force me to face it again. Don't force me to hear it again. The crushing pressure in my chest is choking me. What if it was real? What if it was not? The concrete under the window of my apartment is mostly unoccupied; maybe this way I could stop this. Please, if you are reading this.. if you hear it.. do not turn around. If you hear a cry in the middle of the night, then do not look. Be careful.Â \n\nThe fog is seeping into the apartment, from the door and the window. I think I can see it dancing in the white air.\n\nI have to go..\n\n..I'm sorry.",

        "text": "When you think, there's probably this quiet voice in your head that you recognize as your own. That's what other people have told me, at least. Mine works a little differently.\n\nIt's really interesting, when you think about it. You go through life assuming something is normal, because nobody really talks about it. Like, who taught you how to take a shower? Nobody, right? What if the way you do it is just.. wrong, compared to the way everybody else does it? You might never know. How often do you watch other people shower? Nevermind, don't answer that.\n\nThe problem I have is that I learned, at 27 years old, that not everyone's inner voice screams at them from across the room. Not everyone's inner voice constantly eggs them on to do horrible things. I've heard of intrusive thoughts. I just have a lot of them, compared to other people. And they are so.. so loud.\n\nIt's also really interesting how the mind tunes certain things out after awhile, or just classifies them as normal. You'd think hearing a mad man with a voice that sounds like mine, but just a little bit off, scream at me from the next room would scare me, but after dealing with it every day, I've just sort of.. gotten used to it. I can't afford therapy. Hell, up until a few weeks ago, I didn't even know it was abnormal.\n\nThe screaming part doesn't scare me. It's when my inner voice gets real quiet, that really scares me. Like it's plotting. My own mind, working against me.\n\n\"Get up.\"\n\nMy eyes shot open, transitioning from a deep sleep to instantly being fully alert in my bed. I glanced over at my clock. 4:34 AM.\n\nI was preparing to roll over and go back to sleep, brushing it off as me hearing things, when the sound of a single footstep echoed throughout my apartment. The sound we all dread to hear, late at night.\n\nSomeone else was in here.\n\n\"Reach into your nightstand.\" my own voice said, seemingly from across the room. I squinted my eyes in confusion. I've never used my nightstand for anything. There's nothing in it.\n\n\"Do it quickly. They are coming.\"\n\nThe voice was so quiet, as though it were afraid the intruder may hear it. That tiny hint of *offness* lingering in it. My words. Just a little bit *wrong*.\n\nI sat up in bed, and reached towards my nightstand to pull open the drawer, expecting nothing. It was too dark to see into it, so I reached in and felt around. My hand immediately rubbed against something hard and cold.\n\n\"How did you-\" I whispered.\n\n\"Point it at the door.\", the voice said. It felt closer now, as though it were coming from a man sitting on the edge of my bed.\n\nAm I crazy? Would I know if I was? Would someone tell me? Would I even listen to them?\n\nAnother footstep, just outside of my bedroom door now. I moved my hand and angled my strangely familiar feeling weapon towards the door. I heard the doorknob jiggle.\n\nThe silence was instantly broken by the sound of a single gunshot, followed by my door swinging open and a body falling to the ground in my bedroom with a thud. I jumped to my feet. My hands were shaking, and it felt like I wasn't fully in control of myself. Like I'd done this before.\n\nI rushed over and flicked on the light, keeping my weapon pointed at the intruder. He was on his stomach, with hole through his back.\n\n\"Please..\" he whimpered. Thank god, he's alive. I might be defending my home, but I didn't want to kill someone if I didn't absolutely have to. I kicked him over, so he was laying on his back. He looked right at me, and his face went from sad and wilted to horrified in an instant.\n\n\"No.. no, what.. what are you?\" he said.\n\nMaybe he hit his head on the way down. Had he not even realized he'd been shot?\n\nThen he started screaming. Oh god, the screaming. Like he was eye to eye with the devil. Suddenly, I spotted movement in my peripheral vision. I swung my gun to the right, only to discover myself face to face with my standing bedroom mirror.\n\nThat's when I understood that something was seriously wrong.\n\nWhat I saw was myself, exactly as I was. But instead of looking at the mirror, I was still looking down at the man, gun pointed at him. It was shocking, to say the least. Like a still image taken from 10 seconds ago. It shocked me even more when the 'me' in the mirror turned to look at the real me.\n\n\"They will never believe you.\" he said, before turning the gun on 'himself', and firing.\n\nI woke up in the hospital a day later. Police reports said that I was defending my home from a home invader, when I succumbed to what they believe was a seizure induced by extreme stress, and passed out, hitting my head on my bed frame on the way down.\n\nAccording to the report, I had shot that man 9 times.\n\nIt was ruled self defense, and I never even needed to go to trial. One 'perk' of living in a deep red state, I guess?\n\nSince that day, the voice disappeared. I finally have what I consider to be 'normal' thoughts. I got a better job, and see a therapist three times a month. Life is getting.. better.\n\nBut every once in awhile, out of the corner of my eye, I'll catch my reflection. It could be anything. A freshly waxed car, a mirror, a black computer screen. And usually it'll be fine, just me doing whatever it is I'm doing. But sometimes, the reflection feels.. different. Sometime's it seems just a little bit..\n\nwrong.",

        "text": "Please read this if you think you can help.\r\nIt was graduation night, my best friend Donna and I were cruising down the highway in my brand new 78 CJ blasting Night Fever by the Bee Gees.\n\r\nâBerkeley here we come!â Donna shouted taking yet another drink from a pilfered bottle of champagne. She stood in the open top vehicle letting her long blonde hair whip in the wind. I couldn't help but grin, we were two young hotties feeling on top of the world! I looked back at the road just in time to see a large animal dart onto the highway, I never had a chance to even touch the brakes. The impact slammed me into the steering wheel. My head bounced off the windshield spider webbing the glass. I fell back into my seat stunned and bleeding. \n\r\nSlowly regaining my senses I turned to the seat beside me only to see it was empty, my adrenaline surging I threw the door open. I stumbled out onto the pitch black highway desperately searching for Donna. The night was silent save for a soft hiss emanating from the Jeeps ruptured cooling system. \r\nAs my eyes began to adjust I frantically searched the empty road. Hearing a soft sob to my right I slid down the embankment. following the sound I spotted a bush, beside it lay my best friend, her arms wrapped tightly around herself. I couldn't make out much in the lack of light but she was alive! \n\r\nI dropped to my knees beside her âDonna Iâm so so sorry!â I tried to help her into a sitting position but she cried out in pain. âItâs going to be okâ I reassured her âI'll get help. Iâll fix thisâ. I frantically looked around trying to figure out how would do just that. \n\r\nâCrystalâ Donna whimpered âCrystal I can't feel my legs, my guts hurt and I can't feel my legsâ. Tears filled my eyes âit's ok Donna, I'll get help. We can't be more than a couple miles from the last gas station. Your dad is the best doctor on the California coast. He'll have you all patched up in no timeâ. I held her tight as we both began to sob. \n\r\nShe started to shiver violently despite the warm spring breeze. I gently shook her âhang in there Donna, I'm going to grab the picnic blanket. I'll be right backâ. She gave my hand a squeeze âIâll try not to wander offâ she joked weakly. \n\r\nI scrambled up to the now silent Jeep as quickly as I could. Pulling the thin plaid blanket from under the rear seat I stood. My eyes had grown accustom to the dark I could make out the form of a large animal laying behind the Jeep. \n\r\nI realized the Jeep must have ran it over after the impact, looking at the size of it I was surprised we hadn't flipped. It's dark hair was long and silky, the breeze gently blowing it side to side. There was a trail of entrails strung down the highway as well as a massive pool of blood under it. It had the shape and build of a dog but was the size of a grizzly bear. \n\r\nA scream pierced the night, forgetting the blanket I sprinted in Donna's direction. \n\r\nI froze at the edge of the road. I couldn't will my body forward. Donna lay where I left her but behind her stood a freak of nature. It had the ears of a wolf but the short snout of a bear. It's glowing yellow eyes were fixated on Donna, itâs knife like teeth barred in her face. While much smaller than the dead one on the road it still dwarfed Donnaâs crippled form. She screamed again as it laid a massive paw on her chest. My knees began to tremble at the sight of itâs long curved claws. \n\r\nIn a flash it forced itâs claws threw her chest, her screams turned to gurgling as blood spurted from her dying body coating the creatures chest. Donna's body convulsed violently on the ground before becoming still. \r\nI started screaming, at first I wasnât even aware it my voice doing it. The creature jumped in surprise before jerking it's head up to look in my direction. It's yellow eyes seemed to pierce right through me. \n\r\nWhat happened next caused my knees to go weak. It stood, the wolf bear stood up like a man. It's chest was double the width of a linebacker, its legs were as thick as tree trunks. The whole body was rippling with muscles visible beneath the silky hair. \n\r\nMy body started running, it took a moment for my mind to catch up but once it did I knew I had to escape. There was a cold intelligence in those eyes that scared me more than the claws and teeth. \n\r\nI made it to the Jeep just as the creature reached the road. It was moving purposefully, in no hurry to end me on itâs own terms. \r\nPraying fervently I turned the key. Nothing happened, I tried again. Not even a click. Nearly blinded by tears I watched the creature slowly draw closer. It seemed to smile in the presence of my fear.\n\r\nSuddenly remembering to depress the clutch pedal I tried again. The little four by four roared to life! I screamed out a triumphant âyes!â \n\r\nWasting no time I slammed the stick into reverse. The Jeep sped backwards only to slam into the dead beast behind me. The creature in front bellowed in rage.\n\r\nI popped it into four wheel drive and mashed the accelerator to the floor. Blood and fur sprayed the creature in front of me as the Jeep spun over it's dead companion. \r\nSeeing the creature was momentarily blinded I took the opportunity to pull a âJâ turn. I managed to take off just as the creature lunged for me. It's claws narrowly missing the rear bumper. \n\r\nI had the engine pinned wide open as I fled. My heart still racing and my mind a mess of thoughts and fears I didn't notice the flashing light on my dash. The temp gauge was pegged and there was a knock coming from under the hood. \n\r\nThe Jeep began to lose speed, panicking I down shifted trying to keep the engine alive. Still itâs speed further decreased. With a bang and clatter of metal pieces the engine seized causing the back tires to lock up. I popped it into neutral and coasted for a couple hundred yards. \n\r\nI sat there gripping the steering wheel too scared to look behind me. A glance in the rear view mirror showed only darkness. \n\r\nI needed to move, fast and far. If the creature was still chasing me I couldn't waste my head start. Reaching back I grabbed the tire iron and I started running. Two years of track and volleyball were about to pay off. \n\r\nThe night was quiet save for the slap of my sneakers on the pavement and my labored breathing. I focused on my pace, if I didnât push too hard I could manage a couple miles without a break.\n\r\nPacing my self went out the window when I heard a blood curdling howl rip through the night.  The creature had caught up much faster than I had anticipated. I was still close enough to hear the smashing of glass as it destroyed the Jeep. \n\r\nI ran at a full sprint, I pushed every ounce of strength I had into my legs. My lungs were screaming and my vision blurry but I pressed on. \n\r\nI don't know how far I made it before one foot hooked behind the other and I was launched face first into the pavement. I lay there gasping for air. Despair was welling up inside me, I wasnât ready to die! Especially not at the hand of some monster still soaked in my friends blood. \n\r\nBefore panic managed to truly take hold of me I saw a dim light through the trees. Looking closely as the pines waved to and fro I saw another. Street lights! \n\r\nWithout a second thought I tore through the woods ignoring both the thorns and branches that ripped my clothes and dug into my flesh. Ahead lay salvation! All I had to do was reach it before that creature caught me. \n\r\nThe lights twinkled ahead of me, luring me in with their promise of civilization and safety. Another howl erupted, the beast had found where I had left the highway. I found myself in awe at how much emotion could be discerned through it's primitive form of communication. \r\nThe first outburst had been filled with rage and hatred, this one held tones of hunger. Of a desire to exact harsh revenge. \n\r\nI wouldn't be giving it the satisfaction. l stumbled onto a freshly paved road, it's sickly sweet smell permeating the night air. Ahead stood evenly spaced multi story wooden structures. My heart dropped into my stomach. They weren't complete houses, this was a construction site not a neighborhood. \n\r\nI was spurred ahead by the sounds of something large crashing through the bushes. I ran to the nearest house with fully erect walls. Despite fumbling with the door latch I managed to open it just as the beast exploded from the tree line.\n\r\nOur eyes made contact, I could see a pure and savage joy in those yellow orbs. I slammed the door shut as it began it's sprint in my direction.\n\r\nI took in my surroundings, exposed wires and plumbing ran through the naked studs leaving no where to hide. Upstairs felt like my only option, I ran up just as heavy steps hit the front porch. \n\r\nNot a second later the front door was ripped from the wall and cast aside. I held still, not even willing to breath as the beast entered. It had to stoop as it came through the door but was able to stand freely once inside. \r\nIt sniffed twice then emitted a deep growl. My heart beat even faster as it walked to the stairs. They groaned in protest as it took them one slow step at a time.\n\r\nI crept back from the stairwell, as I did my hand brushed something. It was a discarded two by four, maybe four feet in length. Thinking quickly I grabbed it with both hands, just as the beasts awful head became visible I swung with all my might!\n\r\nFirst it yelped in pain as the board cracked over itâs skull, then it cried out in surprise as it lost itâs footing and crashed back down the stairs. \n\r\nMy hands were ringing from the impact but I had done it! My triumph was short lived however, rage filled roars echoed up from the first floor. \n\r\nI ran for the front window, the empty hole led onto a small roof. I climbed out quickly, behind me wood was splintering and flying across the house as the beast charged up the stairs using all four limbs. \n\r\nI jumped from the roof landing on a pile of dirt nearby. Above me the beast had wedged itself in the window hole. \n\r\nI took this moment to grab a one foot piece of rebar. The beast froze, it watched me with suspicion as I took my stance. \r\nWinding up I took my shot, the bar spun end over end before striking true. The beast screamed in pain as the metal sunk deep into itâs left eye. I had no time to celebrate, in itâs pain fueled rage the beast tore itself free and lunged for me. \n\r\nSpinning to the side I was nearly fast enough, three of itâs claws slid across my stomach. The tank top I was wearing offered no protection, I doubled over as the lines turned red. \n\r\nI had no time to inspect my wounds, I dove into the nearest crawlspace. The beast reached for me blindly, it swung itâs enormous arm around the dark space. I crawled away from the entrance, tears once again coursing down my face. \n\r\nMy stomach burned where I had been clawed. I put my hand to it and it came away wet. I didnât need a light to know it was blood. \r\nBehind me the beast was tearing at the concrete foundation, breaking off small chunks at a time with itâs long claws. \r\nI felt trapped, sooner rather than later it would get in and I wouldnât be able to avoid it for long. I curled up and crossed my arms over my bleeding abdomen. \n\r\nThe snarls seemed to fade as I lay there. I had crawled into a hole with no way out. This was how I was going to die, I would be pulled apart and devoured. \n\r\nI rolled onto my back and looked up. Rather than  there being a subfloor above me I was staring at an opening. There was an indoor crawl access! Suddenly filled with the desire to live I sprang into action.\n\r\nI climbed up into the unfinished house above . Below me I could here the beast navigating the small space. It growled in frustration as it searched for me. Time and time again it bonked itâs head on a beam and released a roar of frustration. \n\r\nI grabbed a tool pouch that was hanging near by, I threw a board over the access hole and began nailing it closed. \n\r\nThe beasts arm shot through the gap nearly severing my hand! It grasped the floor in an attempt to pull itâs self up. I swung the hammer with all my might, the first blow landed with a crack between itâs eyes. The second time I swung I sunk the claw clean through itâs wrist and pinned it to the floor!\r\nAt that point I ran, behind me the house was filled with pained roars. I didnât stop, I ran in the direction of the highway. \n\r\nThe evening faded after that, before reaching the road I saw flashing red and blue lights. I pushed myself to head in their direction.\r\nI later learned that a truck had stopped at my wrecked Jeep, he called the highway patrol with his CB radio. They told me they had heard strange animalistic noises far in the woods, they were getting ready to call search and rescue when I came crawling out of the woods covered in blood and dirt.\n\r\nDonnaâs body was never found, the official story is that we hit a bear although the body of the first creature disappeared as well. I was then consequently mauled by the bear before it ran into the woods possibly taking Donnaâs body with it. \n\r\nI still have the scars across my stomach to this day, they have faded to the point that I just tell people theyâre from my C section. Only my husband knows what really happened that night. \n\r\nThat was forty four years ago, the reason I bring it up is because of my daughter. Sheâs twenty two, her and her boyfriend went camping for a week. The night before last she called me saying a giant one eyed bear had destroyed their truck.\n\r\nThey were stranded in the mountains not even fifty miles from where I had my experience. She told me the bear looked wrong, that it had destroyed the  truck then seemed to grin as it walked back into the woods on two legs. \r\nIâve called everyone I can think of, my husband and I each bought a rifle and are heading that way as soon as I post this. \n\r\nI donât know how true the stories on here are but hope at least one of the supposed monster hunters are the real deal because we need help. No one can find our baby. Please, help us kill the beast of [REDACTED] Forest. We will pay you everything we have.",

        "text": "**SETTING**\n\nWhen I was younger I used to live in the middle of nowhere. We had neighbors but we were separated by a fairly large amount of land and lines of trees. This area I lived in is known for addicts, kidnappings, and overall a lot of sketchy things even though the population was small. I lived in an old schoolhouse on an old property that had a church, another school house, and an old graveyard that sat directly behind my house.\n\nOne night I was about 15, it was summer and I had been up all night playing old games I had installed on my PC. We had internet but it was one of those terrible limited services that only gave you like 2GB a month or something like that. I wasn't familiar to this type of lifestyle since I grew up playing video games online and watching YouTube so most of the time I just sat in silence if I wasn't watching a movie I'd already seen on DVD for the 20th time.\n\nThis night in particular it was 2 A.M. and my house was completely silent. I was wearing headphones while playing a game but during a moment of silence I heard rustling outside the house. We also had two dogs on the property and soon after hearing leaves rustling outside they started barking aggressively. I was also on the second floor of the house so I looked out my window and didn't see anything so I figured maybe it was just an animal or something else.\n\nA few moments later though while trying to get rid of my paranoia loud thuds and screams immediately shot my adrenaline through the roof. My parents at the time had their room in the basement so my first reaction was to run downstairs and try and get there to get them. Luckily my step dad had already heard the noise and we met at the same time. We look over into the kitchen where our back patio was and saw some man beating on the door screaming for help. My step dad had went over to the door and began talking to him and noticed he was wearing a brown jacket and blue jeans and they were covered in blood.\n\nMy step dad began trying to ask him questions telling him to get back all while the guy was pleading trying to find any way into the house. The first question he asked was why he was covered in blood, to which the guy claimed he was shot and people were in the woods hunting him. This immediately caused my step dad to have me get a gun and to turn all the lights off in the house so if it was true they couldn't see where we were in the house. During all of this I remember my step dad telling him to show us his wound so we knew he wasn't lying. Sounds like a weird thing to ask but at the time the guy was being odd and he kept asking if he could get into our basement or would say things like I'm gonna climb through your window if you don't let me in.  Nevertheless the guy refused to show us that he had been hurt and eventually confessed that it wasn't his blood. I remember in this moment it made my heart drop.\n\nIn the middle of all of this the cops have already been called and the cops said they were by the house and for some stupid reason said to come outside so they could find the house. With my luck my step dad tells me to go out to the front porch and wave the cops down while he watched the guy on the back porch. This was the scariest moment for me cuz I was the one that had to go out and get the cops all while not knowing if he was alone or if other people were actually after him.\n\nAs I open the front door I see a few cop cars go right past our house not seeing me waving and I remember panicking telling them that they drove right past us. Eventually though the cops do arrive and I slam the front door and lock it again. I remember seeing bright lights shine on the guy at our back door and hearing police intercoms yelling at the guy telling him to get off the porch.\n\nAt the end of it all it turns out the guy was a druggie and he had family nearby and they apparently took him home and did nothing but drop him off. We never got to find out where the blood came from and how or why he even ended up at our house. This was one of many weird things that had happened while living there and i'm glad that I don't have to ever go to that place again.",

A tiny city in a tiny country most of you have never even heard of. Me and my girlfriend, live in uni accommodation in the city, I lost contact with my high school friends so practically my entire friend group lives in the same building. The uni dorms are very large, very full and (unsurprisingly) VERY loud. It's common to see and hear drunk students and party guests throughout the halls at night, you begin to tune it out over time and stop paying attentionâ¦ perhaps that's why they were less careful around us.\n\nAnyway, orientation week was coming up and my mates and I thought it would be a good night to go out clubbing. I don't know if it's the same everywhere else but all the nightclubs here treat orientation like it's Christmas. Toga parties, angel and devil nights, the whole lot. The rest of my group chat hardly ever even replies to messages like this but I can always count on Ethan and Andre to come out to town. So last Wednesday, we headed to Sapphire. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of Sapphire, it's always too crowded, and there's no seating whatsoever but Andre was set on going to this gig tonight so me and Ethan kind of just followed.\n\nWe got into the club with no problem as we had only a few pre-drinks. I thought I saw someone cut in front of us as the bouncer was checking our IDs. But they couldn't have. There was another bouncer on the other side who didn't seem to see anything so I didn't really react to it. \n\nAndre went off to mosh while me and Ethan went to order drinks. Ethan orders a beer, I order a Jager bomb.  Just as the bartender hands me my drink, I hear Ethan's voice next to me. \n\n\"Is that dude staring at us?\" \n\nI paid no attention to Ethan, I didn't even look around, as I was too busy paying the bartender. I didn't really even take in his words because I was too busy wondering how a shot of Jager and Redbull could combine to cost $12.  But before I could reply, a full bottle of beer shattered around my feet. Ethan's beer. I flicked around to see what had happened, Ethan wasn't stupid, and he wasn't drunk. Had someone knocked it out of his hand? \n\nBut Ethan was gone.\n\n \n\nAt first, I assumed he had just headed into the moshpit to hang out with Andre. But then the bartender spoke up.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" She laughed, before looking around confused.\n\n\"See what?\" I replied, a bit bewildered by the whole situation.\n\nShe replied, \"I swear I just saw someone run into your mate?\"\n\nI looked behind me, looked at the ground. No Ethan to be seen. Looking at the floor, I think I remember a pair of legs sprinting past me but I was focused on looking for Ethan, so I didn't really register them or react to them.\n\nConfused, I looked up at the bartender. She was gone as well? Where had she gone? There was another customer behind me in the line, and she was the only one behind the till so she wouldn't just leave her post like that.\n\nI was beginning to get freaked out, I pushed my way to the moshpit to Andre, maybe Ethan was with him. Andre was in his own world, dancing in the mosh pit, he was focused on the DJ, focused on the girls, focused on dancing along with everyone else. \n\nAs far as I can tell, no one but me, even saw what was standing behind him. I canât tell you what I saw for reasons iâll explain later but trust me when I say this thing was NOT human, althoughâ¦ yetâ¦ human enough, that it could almost blend into a crowd like thisâ¦ almost.\n\nI was about to call out. To scream, or point. To call security to signal to Andre to run. Thank God I didn't, because as soon as that creature turned around to face me, everything clicked.\n\nEthan tried to point something out to me, and then he vanished.  \nThe bartender called out his attacker, and she vanished too.  \nYet Andre, and everyone around him, were minding there own business, and they were fine.\n\nAs it turned around to face me, its hideous features burned into the back of my eyelid. I calmly brought out my phone and began texting my girlfriend.\n\n\"I'm coming home. Do not text me, keep the doors locked until I arrive. I'll explain everything when I get there.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned around as calmly as I could and walked away. I walked up the stairs and turned up the road. I heard a side door open, I did not react.\n\nI heard footsteps scuttling behind me, I did not turn around. \n\nThen, Andreâs voice \"Yo Cody! Where are you going!?\"\n\nI prayed to whoever was listening that the creature was well hidden again, that Andre would not see it tailing me. I almost broke down, I wanted to scream at him to leave but I just couldn't. So I continued walking, then he said it.\n\n\"Who's that with you?\"\n\nAs far as I could tell, those were his last words.\n\nI walked to the halls, I wanted to cry but this thing was still sussing me out. I wanted to break down in tears but I knew what would happen if I registered this thing's existence. I started to wonder if leading this thing home was even the smart thing to do but I didn't CARE anymore, I just wanted to curl up in bed, and stay under the covers until whatever this thing was decided I was deaf or blind or stupid enough to leave alone.\n\nI unlocked the gate, it clambered over the wall, I got in the elevator, IT GOT IN WITH ME. The whole ride it was towering over me, staring at me, wondering how I hadn't noticed it yet. I walked to my apartment and knocked on the door. My girlfriend called out to me.\n\nThe second she yelled out, the creature vanished, sprinting away at an unnatural speed down the hallway and ducking behind what I think was a bin. I don't know, I wasn't looking. I called out to my girlfriend, who impishly opened the door, clearly terrified by my text. \n\nThe thing was very well hidden yet the hallway had very little cover, whatever this thing was, it could conceal itself very wellâ¦ not that it mattered because as my girlfriend opened the door, I saw it. The creature's face pressed up against the window behind her, watching ME. But it was different, the features were slightly screwed, slightly changed. The daunting realization hit me that no doors had opened in the hallway, and we were 6 stories up. This was not the same creature. \n\nAs my girlfriend turned around, the face at the window ducked out of sight.  \nShe turned back to me, it rose back up. \n\nThe face could switch from pressing its face against the window to vanishing beneath it with such seamless efficiency I had to remind myself I couldn't allow myself to be mesmerized by its movements. My girlfriend was being watchedâ¦ but she would never have any idea. Had it been here all night? All week? How long had this thing been here, pressing its monstrous face against the window, and yet somehow staying out of sight?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quietly explained to her what had happened, starting by explaining that she couldn't react to what I said no matter what. Then explaining the creature's details, what it looked like. Maybe it was stupid but I had never been more stressed and confused in my life and I just wanted someone to talk to.\n\nShe calmly gulped, a tear rolled down her face. She wandered over to the cupboard and started sifting through papers. I wondered if she even believed me, or whether she was just taking my \"act natural advice\" very seriously. But then she pulled out the drawing.\n\nI child's drawingâ¦ HER childhood drawing. A young girl, surrounded by at least half a dozen tall inhuman figures. I didn't get a good look, one second she was there in the hallway, the next I couldn't even recognize her corpse. A THIRD creature, stood in her place, her lifeless body broken and bloodied on the carpet. Her arms and legs were mangled and twisted like broken twigs, her faceâ¦ unidentifiable.\n\nIf you were hoping to get a proper description of these things, I'm sorry. Now you know why that isn't going to happen. I would rather die than allow someone to recreate that drawing, God forbid someone ever posts a sketch of this thing on the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTerror doesn't even begin to describe what I was feeling, face to face finally with this thing. But it got worse when I heard the window shatter, and the door break down. All three creatures, standing in my dining room, staring down at me as I sat, staring at my girlfriend's mutilated corpse.\n\nThe creatures stood and waited.\n\nAnd waitedâ¦\n\nAnd waitedâ¦\n\nUntil finally I stood up, walked over to the fridge, took out a beer, sat right back down in my chair, and drank it calmly.\n\nI don't know what kind of primal willpower I had in that moment, what kind of drive or mental strength I had during the worst minutes of my life. But after I did, the creatures left. In the blink of an eye, the body had been removed, and the blood was cleaned up.\n\nA few days later I was called into the station to help clear the air about my missing friends, I told them very little. Ethan, Andre and my girlfriend have all gone down among ever growing list of missing peopleâ¦\n\nI wonder how many others are missing for the same reason?  \nHow many innocent people are in jail, blamed for these monsters' crimes?\n\nI needed to make this post, I need to let people know.   \nThey no longer hide from me.\n\nThey are everywhereâ¦\n\nYou couldn't possibly comprehend how many you walk passed every day, how many are watching you as you drive to work. You have no idea how many dark corners they lurk in, and how many windows they stand outside. You havenât seen how many roofs they cling to, the crowds they stand among.\n\nIf you share this to your loved ones, make sure they read it lying down. Remind them to read it on a phone and tell them to hold the phone no less than 6 inches from their face. Because more often than not, you are not alone.",

But strange things were [happening](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10eau6r/lets_be_frank/).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then, I have buried 3 more without incident. and Still. Each time they watched. Wide, fascinated eyes as I dug. The only difference was how I went about it now. Quiet. Quick. Quit. No longer waiting to bathe in their praises or go down to the pub after for drinks. If I had known that Frank would be the type to turn down a free drink, all those months ago, I would have told myself, \"Don't be Frank.\"\n\nBut here I am.\n\nStill the keeper of the kept.\n\nAnd perhaps in my fear, my isolation would have endured. However, when I began to miss a drink and a face to smile into. I slowly started returning to life back at town. Still, I refrained from the pub ' even when Ronald Atkins croaked and I bore the hole, of free drinks and singing into the night. Instead I chose the relative corners where the people minded their business. The library, the pharmacy, and the company of merry travelers at the edge of town.\n\nIt was in the library where I met Sam. She was lovely; if the word could fight for justice. And I had grown quite fond of her. Young, and in love. What a thing to be. Always polite, and bright. The gem in her eye was Nathan Dugunninghem, and from what I seen of sorts. A fine gentleman. He was seldom seen drinking in town. I would know. And he seemed equally as smitten.\n\nSo the morning he turned up dead in a radish field with all of his clothes on. And no money stolen from his person. The town was in an uproar. It had caused so much concern, that a young man of Achnought, seemingly in good health, would be found dead. Enough for the Priest to find refuge with me at the cemetery.\n\n\"Well liked.\" He clicked his tongue. \"Nothing but good things to say about the boy.\" He passed me the flask in his hand. \"Except...\"\n\n\"Fine lad.\"\n\n\"-the things they say about him in town.\" The Priest looked at me, red in the face. \"Did you hear about them?\"\n\nI wished I lied, \"I've heard what they said. But to me it seems normal for a chap to care for his. Normal anywhere else.\"\n\n\"So you knew them? Then you'd know it wernt his. Were it.\"\n\nI stood up.\n\nThe Priest followed, \"They called him stupid. Foul names.\" He took another swig and then nudged it toward me.\n\n\"No, I'll be frank. Dangerous to drink anymore and mind the field.\"\n\n\"I mean. What kind of man would care for another man's son? He was asking for it. If not from the boy's father than the ghosts of his ancestors.\" He grabbed at his foot, \"Bloody-.\" And kicked at the rock, \"What the hell is that doing here?\"\n\nIt was a rather large thing. For I had used quarry stone and some marble, leftover from the burials as markers. Some were larger than a man's back, big thick slabs, I hauled.\n\n\"Keeps the gnats at bay.\"\n\n\"W-what?\" The Priest looked baffled as he swung wildly in every direction.\n\nI had lined rocks against all of the suspect trees, they ran in a near straight line along the ridge.\n\n\"Gnats? I don't see any gnats.\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"I think my foot is bleeding.\"\n\nI was afraid of what the Priest looked about doing. For his boot was off and his sock, too. But before he could ask, a familiar figure ran toward us from my corner cornea. It was Paul McConnelly. He was waxing and waning as he approached. \"Fellas,\" he panted. \"I've got,\" I handed him a handkerchief. \"Terrible news. Oh, thank you.\"\n\n\"What is it man,\" the Priest sounded annoyed, \"Spit it out.\"\n\n\"There's trouble. Trouble,\" he gasped. \"At Netter's field.\" He motioned, \"Quick. You need to come Father,\" he urged the Priest. \"It's Alan Netter. He's digging.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe scene at the farm was solemn when we arrived. The workers were lined up outside the barn. Their faces stern and unflinching. Mrs. Netter was in a fuss. She seemed the only thing moving. \"I'm so sorry,\" she kept apologizing. \"For bringing you down here Father.\"\n\nThe Priest nodded, \"How long has he been at it?\"\n\n\"The others found him in the northwestern plot a few hours ago.\" Mrs. Netter pulled on the Priest's sleeve. \"Oh Father. Please help him.\"\n\n\"When was the last time anyone's seen him?\"\n\n\"This morning, about six. He woke up to check the livestock per usual.\"\n\n\"Frank,\" the Priest told me. \"If I can't coerce him out. I'm going to need you to ' by force.\"\n\n\"What's going on Father,\" I asked.\n\n\"Can you do it?\"\n\nMy questions were halted as we rounded the barn and in swift sweeping synchronization our feets came to a stop in front of the stone wall that came up to my waist. Out in the field, the sun coming down behind him, a hellish red kiss, cast the dark figure of Alan Netter, shoveling at the dirt. He pulled back the handle and plunged it into the ground. The manic way in his arms. And his lips that kept gibbering. I could see the dirt fly but no hole. The sight made me tense in my bones. Afraid to stir Farmer Netter. That he would notice me standing out here in this open field with nothing in my hands.\n\n\"Alan,\" the Priest called out.\n\nNetter's head shot to the sky as if smelling the air. And then resumed digging.\n\nThe Priest motioned for the three of us to circle him. Paul was to my right as we made good to surround.\n\n\"Alan,\" the Priest spoke gently. \"You're going to need to stop now.\"\n\nPaul spooked easily next to me when Alan jerked violently from the ground; whom resumed digging as we stood rooted to the ground. I'd known shovels all my life, handled them well. Familiar with their shape and use until it was no more different than a pencil. But now all I could remember were how heavy they could be. The thick cast iron tip, raised and porous head that would tear even the sun hardened skin of a worker.\n\nThe Priest was now close enough to put a hand on Alan's shoulder. It was a big mistake. I saw the lunge start from his feet. It twisted into his midsection, as his shoulder arched the shovel over his head. We scattered like ants.\n\n\"Someone grab him,\" the Priest shouted.\n\nOnly to come swarming back in like bees.\n\nPaul rushed in and I heard the sound crack against his head. His body stiff as it fell over. The Priest took the chance and grabbed an arm. Tucking an elbow deep into his chest, screaming, bloody screaming for me to subdue angry Alan.\n\nI froze.\n\n\"Someone help!\"\n\nIt was Mrs. Netter screaming. But the workers lined outside the barn didn't move a finger. They only watched. I could see the fire from the torches light their faces.\n\n\"Someone,\" the lady begged.\n\nI was surprised as any, when I saw Paul get from his knees toward Alan. The shovel swinging in the air. And Paul clung to that raving stark figure. His eyes were closed. So I shut my eyes too and yelled as I rushed in. I felt us tumble to the ground. Taste the dirt in my mouth as I scrambled to my feet. Alan dived onto the Priest's chest. I tried to pull him off. But there was an unexpected strength behind the older man's frame.\n\n\"Put him down!\" The Priest gasped for air between the blows raining down on him. \"Put. Him. down.\"\n\nBut I was already shaking so hard, that I couldn't think of what to do. And my next surprise was when the daintier Mrs. Netter grabbed the shovel from the upturned ground and kicked it into her husband's thigh. He howled viciously. Blood flowed freely from his face from the Priest's clawing. He turned to stare into her eyes.\n\nShe met his anger with another blow from the shovel. And then another. He twitched. And then one other.\n\nAlan collapsed above the Priest. And it took us a few moments to pull up the pair. I had the Priest under one arm, and Paul was practically carrying Alan Netter.\n\n\"Back to the house,\" the Priest spit onto the ground. There was blood in it. \"Where's his hole?\"\n\n\"What,\" I asked.\n\n\"His hole, Mrs. Netter,\" he shouted. \"Where is it?\"\n\n\"In the main house,\" she told him.\n\nThe Priest nodded, and she led the way.\n\nWhen we drew close, the workers slowly started coming closer. Their eyes still dark in the firelight. But not once did they help us. Only watched. Their eyes followed us up the steps, and inside the pastel yellow house with a wrapped porch in darkened walnut.\n\nThe entire floor was bare. All the tables and chairs. The sofa. Stood in the dirt. The bright yellow light over the dining table ' swinging back and forth, mimicking the scream I wanted to emit as we drew deeper inside. The hallways narrowed and the dirt floor was kicked up from our tussling boots. I coughed as the door creaked into the last room at the end.\n\nIt looked like any other room. Except for the barren floors. It had a dresser. Some books. A writing table. A lamp on that writing table. Except. Except there was no bed. Instead in its place were two deep holes. Behind them, what looked to be pencil shavings in hay sized bales.\n\n\"Put him in there,\" the Priest directed.\n\n\"No,\" Mrs. Netter suddenly objected.\n\n\"What? Why,\" Paul huffed. I could see the sweat had resorted to a pour upon his forehead. Smell him.\n\n\"That's my hole,\" she claimed.\n\n\"Put him in that one then,\" the Priest groaned. \"Just hurry Paul.\"\n\nWhen we finally placed Alan Netter into the hole. The Priest gathered the pencil shavings from behind and packed the unconscious man in good. The Priest motioned for us to help. And even with the 3 of us. It took nearly an hour to finally finish.\n\nWhen we were done the Priest leaned back against the table and proclaimed, \"He'll be good in the morning.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor most parts of the way back to the cemetery. We walked in silence. When the town neared, Paul said something and with a nod he drifted off a road, down. I kept walking. My body sore from my ordeal. The Priest never stopped either. Not even when we passed the Church. Nor when we the last lights of town ebbed. I knew he was coming with me back to the cemetery.\n\n\"Did you want to talk,\" he asked. \"I suppose it's time you know.\" He scratched at his head. \"Did you see the hole? The one Alan was digging in the field.\"\n\nI didn't say a word.\n\n\"I don't know when it began. Some say it was when we took the native land from its people. When we first built Achnought. Some say it's older. That we brought it here from across the pond. No one knows the specifics. We just know that every few years. The digging stops. Stops getting as deep. It starts off alright. Perhaps as far as a man could want it to go. In the beginning. But as the days stretch on. The years. The hole gets less deep. We dig it. And throw it away. But it starts to fill itself. That's what happened to Nathan Dugunninghem. Shame. Good lad. Even if. Well you know.\"\n\nI still hadn't spoken a word. Unsure of what to make of it.\n\n\"You should have seen it. When we found Nathan in the field. He had cleared nearly a quarter acre of topsoil. And he never got more than 2 inches deep. The place looked like a war field. Scarred. All over the land.\"\n\nThe Priest looked at me uncertainly, \"Come on Frank. I need you to say something.\"\n\nI had been watching him carefully this entire time. His hands had been irregular beneath his clothing. I was afraid he would hurt me if I didn't go along, \"Why do you need me?\"\n\nThe Priest smiled, a tired crinkling. \"Somewhere in the years. A rumor that an Achnoughtian only has a few number of digs in his life. An invisible counter if you'd believe it.\" He laughed just thinking, \"It's why all the field hands are from Murieta. And so the townsfolk won't do any digging themselves if they can help it.\"\n\n\"Why not get someone from Murieta then?\"\n\n\"They won't do it. We've tried. Not anymore.\"\n\nWe had finally reached the cemetery. I took a right turn. I wanted to avoid taking him back to the house with me. Instead we climbed the ridge. Moonlight danced among the trees. \"What happened to the last groundskeeper?\"\n\n\"He left. Hey. Honest to God's truth.\" He held up his hands. The first time I could see them clearly. \"Someone in town came one day and reported back that the place had been emptied. Jack Portas, the man was. He up and left.\"\n\n\"Why was Mamie Strue sitting above her grave?\"\n\nThe Priest chuckled, \"I don't know. Mamie was one of the good ones. I fully expected her to be kept. But they spit her out. Or.\" He paused. \"She broke out.\"\n\n\"Her husband.\"\n\n\"What? Donald?\"\n\n\"Yes. I saw her get up and stand next to him.\"\n\n\"She always did love that...no good. No good speaking ill of the dead.\" He patted his face. Sweating.\n\n\"What about the trees?\"\n\n\"What? What about them?\"\n\n\"There's something funny with the trees.\" I turned and looked him in the eye. \"They're moving.\"\n\nWe were now at the peak of the ridge. Surrounded by the tall white birch.\n\n\"The trees? No. There's nothing wrong with the trees. Frank. It's the cemetery,\" he spread his arms below us. \"Shit.\" Then he laughed, a hollow sound. \"Nearly scared the life out of me.\"\n\nI turned my attention below us.\n\nA small figure stood in the graveyard. I've seen those wobbly knees before. Knew every row by heart. Knew the grave. It was Sam's little boy. He had come to stand before Nathan Dugunninghem's grave. Afraid to come during the burial. Afraid of what the townsfolk would say. The boy stood there now with tears streaming down his face.\n\n\"I didn't say anything. Not really,\" the Priest murmured. \"At Nathan's service.\" He clicked his tongue, \"I regret that now.\" He turned to me, \"I'm quite envious, you know? I didn't expect Nathan to be accepted by the dirt. Especially not when I learned that he lost his depth so early. Shame. Just when I thought I had it all figured. It throws in another wrench.\"\n\n\"He was a good man,\" I answered.\n\nThe Priest nodded and pulled the flask from his pocket. Raising it. \"Here's to a better man than me. For many have called him foolish. But to one child he was love. And that means more than that which is born from hate.\"\n\n\"Amen.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[S](https://www.reddit.com/r/CornerCornea/comments/u6rx8n/subscribe/)",

        "text": "We have been on this journey for an eternity, though I have yet to sign the moon rise or the sun fall. \n\nThe sun. The sun. That endless, sweltering furnace which roasts me into a withered pelt. \n\nMy comrade, both paler and more exposed than I, walks under the same radiations yet seems largely unaffected. She has yet to notice my slowed gait, my crusted lips and arid tongue. \n\nI have stopped in protest many times, and yet she calls me onward each time, chirping with an eerie cheeriness in direct contrast of our dismal surroundings. She maintains a faultless gaiety as we climb up and down and left and right and onward and onward and onward. \n\nMy feet have begun to ache. My hair feels as though it will spark and combust into a portrait of burnt epithelium and pulp. My tongue is ash. \n\nAt last, I slam my feet in dissent and sit upon the sizzling earth. I will be unmoved without provision, without at least a paltry sip of water. \n\nMy companionâs guise, at last, shifts. At first coaxing and cool, her voice shifts into the unsure crunch of guilt and frustration. Her form grows larger in her frenzy, and I feel her blessedly begin to block out the sun. She bellows indiscernible commands, but I turn my cheek and refuse to be moved. \n\nThen. Then she shifts again, her disposition outperforming the sun with hot rage. She grabs me by the collar, yanking my face so close to hers that I feel pungent breath floating on my own nostrils. \n\nâLucy,â she grunts between gritted teeth, âWe have to keep moving.  Iâm out of water, the sun is going to set soon, and I donât have any cell reception. If you donât move weâll be up shit creek without a paddle. I love you, but you know I canât carry youâso please move your ass!â \n\nSomehow, my tongue achieves a new level of desiccation. The moisture within my veins boils up and steams me into complete aridity. I am an urn, sucked of all fluids and carrying the powdery remains of my form. \n\nAll this time. All this time she had had water, but shared none. She carried supplies for both of us, yet granted me nothing. She ignored my protests. Flitted around me with false encouragements and promises. Buzzed under the heat of the day and shifted all blame onto my poached constitution. \n\nI cannot handle this audacity. Something in my fried brain breaks, and I feel it bulge and burst out of me like some festered cyst. I release a howling deep from within my brittle bones; screaming against the injustice of it all. I scream and scream and scream and again refuse to be shaken. I will not move without receiving my just deserts. \n\nAnd desert me she finally does. I am left, shrieking under the sweltering weight of endless sunlight. My shrieks quiet into moans and finally whimpers as the sun ultimately gives way to the coolness of moonbeam. I curl up onto the scorched but soothing earth, and I give myself to sleepâs embrace. \n\nI awaken in the dead of night, the world alive with the scraping fiddle-feet of bugs and unknown predators. I yelp and jerk away as I notice a trail of these little beasties making a home underneath me. I feel my pupils dilate, my heart kicking into my deepest, primal form. Everything begins to sharpen, my desiccated being alive with fight.\n\nJust as I am ready to leap into action, I hear a familiar call. My comrade, returned for me in the dark! My sharp wits begin to dull, a haze clouding my sensesâdo I fight, flee, or freeze and wait for her? \n\nShe continues to call to me, her voice bouncing off flora and fauna alike. âLucy, Iâm so sorry! Lucy, please come back to me! Iâm here for you!â I hear other, unfamiliar voices join her call. I lock into freeze, my joints both frigid and brittle with dehydration. âLucy! Lucy, we want you safe! We are here for you!â \n\nI hear the crunch of twigs and leaves under their boots. I see the dancing halos of flashlights searching and yearning for one thingâfor my safety. My comrade left me baking in sunbeams, but returned for me with the coolness of a guiding light. The forgiveness floods through me. It comes quickly and easily, flooding me with love and gratitude. At last, I snap into motion. I chase after the sound of her voice. Running. Running. Voices bouncing, but louder.\n\nAt last I find her. And I leap into the arms of my nurturing comrade. The one who calls me âLucy,â âsweet girl,â and yet still honors my most primal form: âdog.â",

        "text": " \n\nSeldom do some people listen to the little voice in their head; I was given no choice.  \n\n\nThe morning which would set forth the event that would irrevocably change everything was just like any other, with the clouds hanging low, washing away the build-up of dust that had settled over the streets during the night. The wind caught between the valley would make its way through the dense trees and eventually ended up howling a gust against my window. The rattling of the rickety hinge blew one of the windows open. The gust invited itself through and pursued through the stacks of paper on my desk. The whirlwind knocked over some of my collectible astronaut miniatures that were teetering on the edge of their amateurly installed display shelves. This unwelcome gust rudely awakened me from my deep sleep the second I heard my favorite miniature break into pieces on the floor.  \n\n\nI spent a good few minutes trying to find the head of the miniature, as it seemed it fell out of the helmet. After my long search, sliding my hands over the surface of my dusty tiles, I gave up for now and just put the figurine back on the shelves. The sight of the headless astronaut put me in a bad mood right from the get-go. But I didn't have any time to waste scouring every inch of my room; I had to get to my studies. Rarely do I ever crack open my book to study this early, but seeing as my midterms were nearing, I somehow fought against my procrastinating nature and forced myself to write my study guide. I made it my mission to at least get through a page of notes before taking a little break to scroll through my phone. I knew myself well, and I knew I wouldn't be able to focus for long before I caught myself daydreaming and losing my place in my notes. My active imagination was the biggest hurdle that I struggled to master.  \n\n\nAs I rapidly finished the daunting task of writing a whole page of notes, I figured it was only fair to reward myself with a little five minutes of scrolling through the internet. In that small frame of time, when I mindlessly scrolled through funny videos, I came across one video in which the person was comically pointing out how the voice in our heads never changes volume. \n\nThey specified that even if you shouted a sentence in your head or mentally whispered words, the volume never changed. I always quickly go to the comments to see the witty replies that people would leave. The comment section was split among two types of people. One side would point out how they didn't have an inner monologue. No inner voice that narrated every thought as words in their head. The other side of the comments was replying to how their mind was blown at how right the video wasâdetailing how they attempted to change the volume of their inner monologue by screaming mentally or whispering and being taken aback at how the volume would stay consistently the same. I thought it was so dumb because it's evident that the volume doesn't change. It's not a voice. It's just your thoughts. But then I started really thinking about it. This quandary snapped me out of my daze, and I leaned back on my chair to think.  \n\n\nI looked up at my ceiling and thought things. I spoke to myself in my mind, just listening to my inner monologue. I tried to whisper thoughts, but the voice was low, and when I yelled, it was the same. I couldn't explain how it worked since I had never really thought this deeply about it. How the inner monologue even works. And why do some people not have one? How do they function without an inner voice directing their life? How do they read a book without a voice in their head to guide the story and visualize the events? Do they feel the words? Do they feel the events as emotions? I think I wasted more than two or three hours just laying there thinking as I spun my chair back and forth.  \n\n\nAt this point, I had completely forgotten to get back to studying. My curiosity over this strange thought permeated through my mind. As I sat laid back in my gaming chair, I could feel my hair stand up; like the build-up of static electricity in the air. as a hum crept its way through my ears, I quickly dug my pinky and swiveled around in my ear till it was gone. I didn't overthink it. I blew it off as having something to do with the power lines I lived close to. Then as I lost myself in my thought, I tried to yell again in my head, continuing my half-baked experiment in my own mind. But this time something was different. The voice was a little louder. I couldn't explain why it felt like so. I sprang upright and looked side to side, wondering what had changed. I thought I was going crazy for a second. Or that I was probably focusing too hard on my inner monologue, and my brain was tricking itself somehow.  \n\n\nAt first, I could barely sense anything was different. I stopped my little psych experiment before I freaked myself out too much and decided to distract myself from the idea by getting rid of some chores. The concept of studying was a foreign one to me now as I tried to distance myself from thinking about anything for now. My mind took a backseat as I did half-brained chores around the house like cleaning up after the cat's litterbox or sweeping random places.  \n\n\n*\"Honey, what are you doing sweeping the dining room at this time?\"* my mom creepily whispered behind me as she walked around the corner, dragging her feet in her bunny flip-flops.  \n\n\nShe didn't really creep up on me; it just felt that way to me because I was lost in thought. as much as I tried to stop thinking about the video, something about the occurrence before really spooked me.  \n\n\n*\"nothing momma, I'm just keeping busy,\"* I said.  \n\n\n*\"well, why don't ya take your butt upstairs and get to studying? I bet you haven't even cracked open your notebook since you woke up.\"* She snarked back.  \n\n\nI knew she was right. There were more important things to do, and I was wasting time because I freaked myself out thinking too hard over some nonsense. I made my way back upstairs and sat down to organize my scattered papers. The window had blown open again had the wind was starting to get on my nerves. So to remedy this janky window, I tied a shoelace around the middle knobs. It wasn't until I sat down to study that I started to get irritated. Growing ever frustrated with these god-forsaken pages of equations I couldn't even begin to solve, my inner voice shouted. This inner yell threw me forward in a jerk reaction, causing me to wince at the loudness of it.  \n\n\n*\"What the hell was that?\"* I said out loud to myself. I looked around my room trying to spot where that yell had come from. I peeked outside the hallway thinking it was my mom who had called for my attention. But after realizing that it was not her, I came to realize that it had come from my own mind. I tried to brush it off and left the equations unsolved as I scrolled through my Twitter feed in an attempt to distract myself again. But every tweet I read in silence was read in a shout by my inner voice. Every word was hard to read, as the voice in my head grew louder and louder to the point where I couldn't even think to myself, but at the same time, I couldn't help it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n My inner monologue was questioning everything. Everything I thought was done in words. and I couldn't stop myself from thinking. Regardless of my efforts to stop thinking about anything, my inner voice would do as it pleased. It wasn't as easy as closing my mouth. There was no bind or stitches that could shut up the mouth of my mind.  \n\n\nAfter drinking a few pills for my newly developing headaches I lay in the fetal position on my bed facing the blank wall, to not run the risk of my mind running amok and voicing its thoughts about every passing detail of my room and the world beyond the window in a daydream. I avoided thinking anything by listening to music. the words of each song helped me avoid thinking anything at first. But as the familiarity of each song played throughout my playlist my brain could not help but sing along to each song. The voice within my mind oftentimes singing to the lyrics was louder than the song itself. After enough time had passed, the songs were no longer registering in my ears. All I could hear was myself singing the lyrics of the music, without even knowing what the song playing was.  \n\n\nI couldn't escape this never-ending torture; the voice was inescapable. I laid in bed trying to think of what to do, but in doing so came to drive myself insane at having to listen to my own voice throw out ideas at max volume. It became so loud that I couldn't hear my own mother who had come upstairs to my room in a fury.  \n\n\n*\"Hello! are you deaf? I have been calling you for 20 minutes! The food is gonna get cold; get your lazy butt up and get to the dinner table now!\"* she hollered.  \n\n\nI didn't respond, I just turned over to get up, and after she saw me in my horrid state with dark bags under my eyes and a tired expression, she lowered her anger and softly hushed me out of my room to eat. Dinner had done me no good as I still couldn't escape the stream of thoughts blasting away in the depths of my subconscious. When my mother tried to start a conversation to fill the silence in the room, I tried my best to talk to her, but I couldn't remember what I had been doing. And even though I tried to avoid remembering what I did, I could stop my mind from doing so. But as I spoke up to just say anything that came to mind, I found a great calm; as I spoke out loud, my mind was quiet. Because everything I would think of, I just spoke out loud instead. Not giving my mind a chance to think, just say.  \n\n\nThat moment was a blur. I couldn't remember a single word I had said the whole night. For me, that was a success. But I took notice of my mother's off-put face as I made my way out of the kitchen, talking to myself all the way up to my room. I didn't realize how crazy I probably sounded to them. I huddled up in bed with my headphones at max volume. I listened in to live radio of orchestra music. anything white-out words for my brain to focus on and amplify. I stared out the open window at the clear night sky. My gaze was centered on this particularly out-of-place cloud that rained over a house in the distance. I found the unlikeliness of such a thing happening so funny that I hadn't noticed my mother had been standing over me, listening to I speak all of my passing thoughts. She pulled my headphones from my head, demanding my attention.  \n\n\n*\"what's with all that yammering? You sound like a lunatic, yapping away at yourself\"* she said.  \n\n\n*\"oh uhâno I was just talking to a friend. Over the phone... see\"* I turn over my phone to show her it's on, but it just shows the blank home screen. *\"oh, umm... looks like she hung up. damn, let me call her back.\"* I mumbled.  \n\n\nI knew she didn't buy it. I could tell from her stern pose and raised eyebrow that she knew I was bullshitting. But regardless she didn't press me about it.  \n\n\n*\"Alright, well keep it down,\"* she said as she made her way out shaking her head. I didn't know the concerning effects of this mannerism would have on my life until it got worse. I began to speak all of my thoughts out loud; every single idle thought. At first, my little life hack to avoid the loud thoughts was no big deal. Aside from the strange looks of passersby when I talk to myself out loud at the store or when I would walk to school. Although, in class, I had no choice but to listen in to my ever-increasing inner narrator. No doubt the teacher would send me home if I spoke my every thought out loud in class, given no choice but to sit in silence without the ability to focus on even so much as a simple lesson. Just watch as the teacher write indecipherable gibberish on the whiteboard, as my brain is too busy screaming into itself to read the symbols on the board.  \n\n\nLife at home did not get any easier. It appeared that my newfound habit had gotten on my parent's last nerve. My mother looked constantly irritable. Every so often when we would pass each other on the hallway, she would give me this side-eye look of disapproval. They would constantly try to shut me up. She was yelling at me from across the echoing hallways to stop talking. The annoyance got to a point where my mother busted through my door one night; her face lit up red as her temper had risen to explosive levels. she yelled at the top of her lungs for me to shut up. Her neck was swelling, and her veins were showing when she screamed for me to close my mouth. But I couldn't. as much as I didn't want to tell them what was going on because I knew they would send me to the loony bin, my toxic habit of speaking my every passing thought blurt out to her that my inner voice was deafening me; that I had to speak my every thought to avoid thinking them.  \n\n\nInadvertently, my fear had come to reality, as the very next day she had me sent to a therapist. But the therapist didn't yield the results they were looking for. The therapist told my parents I had developed some never-before-seen type of severe psychological disorder. I wanted to just keep my thoughts to myself, but all this would do was make my mind feel like a balloon; the pressure made my skull hurt so much that I had to breathe all those loud thoughts out to get the pain to stop. Sadly the consequences of this were unavoidable. Within a week my mother had me admitted to a mental hospital, saying that my constant talking was driving her crazy; describing to the doctor how my constant talking echoing through the house felt like she had a voice in her head that she couldn't silence. Little did she know the accuracy of that statement was in my case; I scoffed at the irony.Â  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPast the hammering sound of my inner voice banging away at the side of my head, I heard from the doctor that I wasn't the only one experiencing this. A few others in the past week had also been experiencing a similar illness; one he called the Shout syndrome. He is unsure of what's causing it. I was hoping for reassuring words, but instead, I felt the hole I was about to be tossed in get dug deeper.  \n\n\nI didn't want to go. I tried to fight my way out of their hold but to no avail. And as the padded doors closed behind me, I contemplated one last escape, but it was too late. I had voiced out all of my escape plans during my escort. On our way to my room, we heard a subtle whistling sound right before a pop. as the doctors talked to my parents, every so often we would hear the same whistle and pop, but the doctor seldom flinched at the sound. We passed what seemed like a common areaâa big auditorium filled with tables, chairs, and unreadable posters on the walls. There were high windows that let in natural light, but there was no scenery to look at as they were angled partially up at the sky. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe air was frigid as a smooth breeze glided over my skin carrying the smell of rot into my nose. The scent that registered in my brain was the opposite of what I expected a place so clean to smell like. Everything was white, from the tiles on the floor to the walls and ceilings.Â  There were a few people there sitting around who looked like astronauts. They wore clear, bubble-like helmets. But within the helmet, I could see their wide open mouths. They jittered around their heads, eyes wide open as if screaming for something. But no sound could be heard from them. It crept a static sensation up my spine when I made eye contact with one of them. The horror in their eyes would stay engrained in my mind for the entire day.  \n\n\nTime in this white padded room was at a standstill. Yet, even though the room lacked any memorable sights, my inner voice would still attempt to continue its narration of the nothing that filled the room.  \n\n\nThen it got louder.  \n\n\nTalking over my inner voice was now no longer enough. The doctors noticed that it must have gotten louder as my habitual constant speaking had raised to a yell. Occasionally I was brought into a bright room strapped to my bed. They would have me read from a screen out loud. The sentences were comprised of random words that often made no sense to me, but after reading through them, they would quickly adjust a knob in their headsets and jot down on a notepad. A tall man would then walk over to me and paste little patches connected to wires on my head. I stared intensely into his green eyes as his face was lit by the small screen from which all the wires connected to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen they would have me read again. the voice within was shaking my brain; each syllable was a thunder that crashed against the inside of my skull. After they all finished taking down their notes, one of them took out a syringe and flicked the very tip of it before injecting my neck. The sound of my inner yell hurt almost more than the stab itself. But after a minute passed, I heard the voice quiet down for a minute. It was almost a blissful experience, albeit a short-lived one.  \n\n\nMinutes afterward, it grew louder than it was before. My eyes felt a pressure behind them as if the voice itself was pushing them out. My head grew heavy as if the very words I thought filled my brain with its weight. I was numb, unable to speak, only suffering as the voice jabbed pains at my temples. Then one of them comes through the door and slides my head into a bubble helmet. It was near airtight as they clamped it to my thick neck padding. The sight of my breath against the glass launched me into a claustrophobic panic. The suffocating air being pushed through a small tube that was attached to a mechanism behind the helmet had me hyperventilating. The men said nothing. They all stood and waited for me to tire out and calm down before they wheeled me out to my room where I spent the day screaming over the swelling inner voice.  \n\n\nThe room was padded to offer enough comfort to sleep. But I seldom ever managed to do so. My booming thoughts building up a pressure against my eyes kept me constantly awake. Time in here passed at unknown intervals. I became accustomed to what time it more or less was when my handler would come in to take me out. They strolled me out into the common area and sat me down next to others next to the others and their strange helmets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned my head and looked at the girl sitting next to me. I shuddered at the unsightly swelling of her face. Her head was like a ripe tomato; thick veins from her forehead were pumping, and the weight of it made her neck too weak to support it, causing her to rest the mushy side of her head on the inside of the bulbous helmet. Snot dripped out of her nose, and her ears leaked a yellow fluid that stuck to her hair. The more I looked around, the more I saw others like this. Some of them had no eyes. The swelling probably pushed them out of their sockets. I knew this was the case as one kid leaned forward too much and his eyes spilled out of him, sticking to the glass of his helmet.  \n\n\nI cried as I sat there, contemplating my fate. Wondering if I was gonna end up like them, walking around, losing my balance like them, as if teetering on a tightrope. You could hear a pin drop in the room if the inner monologue didn't consume the attention from all the sounds you could possibly receive. I laid my head on the table and looked out into the sky past the window. it was a beautiful clear blue that instilled a sense of freedom waiting to be grasped, only to be interrupted by tiny droplets of rain that started to race down the glass, converging with one another and puddling up at the rusty brace that held the glass. I didn't question the oddity of the mysterious rain falling from the clear sky because my eyes were pulsing from the pressure of my inner conscience shouting away at the frontal part of my head. Then suddenly goosebumps shuddered up my body, and the air tasted like static. My eyes felt a pushing sensation as I was forced to do nothing but to hear myself think.  \n\n\nThen... the voice got louder.  \n\n\nAnd louder...  \n\n\n...then something happened that left me in a state of tormenting hopelessness. in front of me the very next day at the same girl as the day before. Her head was now so swollen that it was compressed into her helmet. I saw her sit there looking at me as several people tried to take the helmet off her, as her thin boney body couldn't hold up her head anymore. Her eyes looked directly into mine as they popped out of their sockets and pressed against the glass, getting smushed by her stretching head. Then the glass from her helmet cracked, and the silence in the room was now filled with the sound of an ear-piercing scream that whistled out through the crack like a boiling kettle. And as another crack appeared, the people handling her strapped her into a padded hand truck and pushed her quickly to the door on the side of the room.  \n\n\n*\"hurry ready the new mixture.\"* shouted the green-eyed man that ran beside the two men pushing the cart.  \n\n\nAs they blasted through the door, I stood up to see what was happing to her. I couldn't see past the high glass window of the door, but I could hear the room become filled with a horrific silence after the sound of a loud pop pushed against the door and splattering the window in red. I looked at my feet and saw blood creep its way under the slit of the door. The time after that moment was a blur. I couldn't focus or think about anything else. I just know I was back in my assigned room when I snapped out of the trance I had been under.  \n\n\nTo my surprise, my parents came in to visit the same day. I looked at them from a distance as they were distraught at my appearance. My mother cried over my father's shoulder as the doctor spoke to them, something I couldn't understand. I saw her signing papers as she wept onto the clipboard occasionally glancing back at me; she could barely hold eye contact for longer than a second as doing so made her lips quiver and her hands shake. After the doctor had finished flipping through many papers on his metal clipboard, she stood up to kiss the glass on my helmet and hug me before she was escorted out. After I saw her face for the last time, the doctors strolled me back into the room with the bright lights and injected me with something. It made my body feel numb, but nothing could rid me of the pain of the screaming narrator that described every sensation. and yet, I felt a release of pressure from behind my eyes.  \n\n\nI can't remember how long I was here anymore. The days in the white padded rooms would pass without signs of time moving forward. Every day the tension would get doubled. Every day I would end up in the room with the bright lights, again being injected with a syringe labeled in a different color. Then I was moved to the common area again where I saw less and less of the bobbleheads. as they escorted me back to my room I took a glance at the room with the big lights as one of the doctors barged out covered in red holding a syringe with a different color label as yesterday, yelling something I couldn't hear past my own screaming thoughts. The room was painted with blood, the walls splattered with pink matter and shards of what I could only think were parts of a skull. I knew that was to be my fate as my body could no longer support my head.  \n\n\nThe very next day as they strolled me to the commons area. A lonely frigid air filled the space where people once stood; there was only one other kid in there. His body was frail, and the fabric of his clothes was loose. as if his body was nothing but bones supporting his pressurized head inside that helmet. Yellow liquid slowed out of his nose and ears and dripped into his gaping mouth permanently locked into the face of a scream. He looked at me once before he hung his head down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lights above flickered subtly, and cloudy dark skies illuminated the room in a somber glow. Men in white attire came running in with aÂ  stroller as. I noticed the glass from his helmet had cracked. Through the cracks seeped drips of blood. I could hear his whistling scream depressurize his helmet as the men tied him to the hand truck to move him out quickly as they injected him with something on his arm. But it was too late. His bubble burst, spewing out chunks of brain matter and tissue all over the floor and onto me. His body jerked as they tied him to the hand truck, swinging his empty helmet case onto the head support. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey drew blood samples out of his dried-up body and other men jotted down solutions on their metal clipboards. I stared motionless at his frail body strapped into the cart, helmet headless and dripping in chunks of tendons and fat. for almost a second, my impending sense of doom and the trauma of seeing it all happen in near slow motion made the voice in my head fell silent. It was just me left.  \n\n\nThen they came for me...  \n\n\nThey wheeled me into the room with the big lights again. The pressure in my brain was too much to handle. The voice was screaming in agony as they strapped me into the bed. Every word was like the bang of a gun. My nose dripped in a yellow goo that smudged the bottom half of my helmet and stuck to the thinning strands of hair caught in the folds of my pressurized face against the surface of the helmet. I knew what was coming. I almost didn't want to accept that this was the end. The doctors scurried to prep a new syringe with a new label. I knew it was the end. The voice was no longer narrating my thoughts; it was only painful screams that didn't even sound like my voice. It felt like someone else was shouting in my ear at the top of their lungs and vibrating my very skull. I felt my eyes mush against the glass being pushed out by the voice screaming in my mind as they tried to inject my jittering body. When I thought it had reached its limit, it only grew louder.\n\nAnd louder!  \n\n\n**And louder!**  \n\n\n**AND LOUDER!**  \n\n\nThe doctors had placed me upside down against the bed, and I felt the opening of the back part of my helmet. I felt jabs at my skin and slicing off my skull, but there was no pain from it. The glass in front of my eye finally cracked and just when I heard the whistling of my pressurized scream ring through the room, I knew what came next. Memories flashed through my mind not as words but as visuals of all the things I had done up until now. Flashes of my parent's faces were the last thing to fly by until finally...  \n\n\nSilence.  \n\n\nA peaceful quiet I had once forgotten. There was no pop, only darkness. I stood on a dark platform. There was no light source anywhere, yet I could still see my own body. There was definitely a silence, but also, the booming voice was now a whisper. I felt a strange disconnect on the right side of my body. As if it was getting stretched out farther and farther away. The voice was growing distant, fading into the darkness. And then, the darkness was halved. The void I was inhibiting was now twice as small. Then I saw a thin line of light that opened up into a blinding glare.  \n\n\nI was facing up moving my eyes side to side, trying to orient myself as my body was lying down when I remembered I was just standing up. The immediate thing I noticed was that there was no longer a voice screaming at my every thought. There was actually no voice at all. I can't even remember what it felt like to have an inner voice, and I struggled to even visualize it because the concept of it was almost like it was never known to me. I saw the doctor standing over me shining a light in my eyes and checking his equipment.  \n\n\n*\"what's going on... how am I alive?\"* I struggle to mutter out. I was shaken at being able to listen to my own voice after so long. I had almost forgotten what it sounded like. Machines beeped and whirred as the doctor continued to analyze me.  \n\n\n*\"a miracle,\"* said the doctor as he walked up to my right side and checked my eyes with a flashlight.  \n\n\n*\"I don't understand... what happened to me? I thought I was d-dead for sure.\"* I whispered  \n\n\n*\"the mixture worked. We were able to pause the shout syndrome for the longest amount of time possible for surgery. Your surgery had to be flawless on the first try. out of all the 33 people you are the only one to make it to the end of the surgery.\"*  \n\n\nMy eyes dried from my shock at hearing his words. Thinking about everyone that had been here. The sheer odds that I was even alive was a revelation I couldn't swallow.  \n\n\n\"but... how? where did the voice go? I struggled to get my words out as my throat felt like it was filled with glass shards.  \n\n\nHe took off his glasses, folding them neatly into his breast pocket and taking a deep breath.  \n\n\n\"It was... controversial. But it was the only way we found would work. The brain is made in two halves. After all our observations, we noticed a strange detail. During a brain scan, we observed where the voice of my consciousness was focused and where the source of the shout came from. The serum we developed effectively shuts down one half of your brain temporarily, causing the inner conscious voice to migrate to the other half. In this way, we somewhat corralled the shouting to one-half. That's when the clock started ticking\"  \n\n\n\"so you...y-you split my brain?\"  \n\n\n\"Precisely. But... there were some drawbacks.  \n\n\nDrawbacks?  \n\n\n\"yes. after the surgery we were able to corral the inner conscience voice to a specific section a your left hemisphere and then we had no choice but to sever the connection.  \n\n\n\"why not just remove the section of the brain altogether? What if the shout comes back?\"  \n\n\nHe sat down on the plastic chair next to my bed and exhaled nervously. \"we initially thought of that as a solution. But we realized that to do so would cause the brain to immediately migrate the inner conscious voice to a different area as it sensed the section being removed. This all happens in fractions of seconds. So I decided the best course of action was to keep the section there but sever the connections. \"  \n\n\n\"so the voice is still in there, just locked away?\"  \n\n\nHe leaned in. *\"yeah, imagine like a cage. It is still connected to the blood vessels so it...err, uh... you will remain alive, but it won't affect other functions of your brain... I think. I'm going to be completely honest with you; we still don't understand what the shout syndrome really is, or what even causes it in the first place.\"*  \n\n\n*\"I guess I'll be the only one who'll ever remember how it felt.\"*  \n\n\n*\"I pray you will be the last one,\"* he said hanging his head down in nervous defeat, whispering at the floor. The exhaustion in his eyes carried a sense of dread in them.  \n\n\n*\"thank you. Thank you for saving me.\"* I whispered  \n\n\nHe looked up at me and the skin around his eyes crinkled; I knew a smile hid behind his medical mask.  \n\n\nI was left to recover for a few days. Surgery was done on my face because of the severe stretching which prolonged my recovery. But one morning I felt a pair of hands grasp over my body in my sleep, causing me to jerk awake. A weeping head laid on my chest; the familiar silver hairs instantly filled my heart to the brim with tears. I never thought I would feel my mom's warm embrace again. I didn't say anything; I just let the tears flow as I held her hand.  \n\n\nWithin the same month, I was released back home. The smell of lavender lingered over the home as my mom tried her best to make my recovery as smooth as possible. she even quit her job to take care of me. I still couldn't talk very well. The doctor said the shouting had shot my vocal cords. Even now, I still wonder what started all this. I'll never forget the feeling of being in those walls. The sight of that boy looking into my eyes is a sorrow ill never heal from. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd even as I make tea to relax, the sound of the whistling from the teapot locks me in a trance as I listen to the whistle, awaiting that eventual Pop that never comes. Nothing will ever get those memories out of my head, even if locked away behind a mental prison. Even on the calmest days, I will sit in my room and glance at my astronaut miniature whose head still remains unfounded, and I'll stare at its empty helmet.  \n\n\nThe nightmarish memories that flood my head occasionally cover my right side in static and reminds me that the voice is still in there somewhere, screaming in the darkness. Sometimes, I hear the distant whispers of me as a fading hum.",

Itâs like you have this need to try and move it, to flex, but all it does is burn your exposed nerves. It shoots this white-hot lightning kind of pain straight through your arm with every heartbeat. I tried my best to just keep the hand still, but even the breeze from moving forward shot through me. There are so many nerves, it felt like licking a live wire.\n\nLeah Babin almost carried me through the woods. She was amazingly strong for her size, and I got the impression that she could just whisk me off the ground if she wanted. There was something about putting my arm around her that just didnât sit right, like she had particularly thick skin and a weird bone structure around her shoulder blades.\n\nâJohn saidâ¦ said you wouldnâtâ¦ harm me,â I managed to puff out in-between groans.\n\nâWell,â smiled Leah. âI said weâd try. I also said if my dear brother couldnât stop himself, Iâd bite his head off.â\n\nI recalled John mentioning that, but Iâd thought it was a figure of speech. But considering what Iâd just heard, and the amount of blood dripping from her jaw, I was considering that it might be more literal than Iâd anticipated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was rushed back. Leah helped me up the stairs, into my apartment, and started to boil towels. She brought a first aid-kit from the supply closet. I got the impression that sheâd handled wounds like this before, but I was too panicked to think about it. Her confidence was all I needed. She kept reassuring me that things would be fine, that I just had to wait and trust her.\n\nWhat choice did I have?\n\nRoughly 30 minutes after we got back, Uncle John came bursting through the door. Without skipping a beat, he pushed Leah away from me. When she stepped forward with a fresh towel, he grabbed her by the throat. I got up and backed into a corner.\n\nâWhat did I say?!â John screamed. âIs this what we agreed on, for you to have my family fucking *mutilated*?!â\n\nâItâs just a finger, John. And besides-â\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI donât know where he got the knife from. It seemingly just appeared in his hand as he pushed it up against her throat. I saw a trickle of blood.\n\nâNo more!â he growled. âNo more smirking. No more bullshit. You broke our deal, and youâre on my *shitlist*.â\n\nâRoy paid the price, I-â\n\nâYou honestly think thatâll trick me?!â John laughed. âIâve *worked* for Hatchet. Iâve read your *goddamn* Galapagos file. And if I see a single one of you in the same fucking *hallway* as *either* of us, Iâm cooking you and your fucking eggs in hydrochloric acid.â\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLeah stopped smiling. A darkness sunk over her face as she locked eyes with John. \n\nâYou heard me. I know,â John grinned.\n\nSomething he said struck a nerve, and Leah could tell this wasnât the time to put on the charm. This was serious. Dead serious, in the literal sense.\n\nâFine,â she said. âYou got until the end of the year. Then weâre through.â\n\nâIâm not doing shit for you from now on,â spat John. âYou stay out of my way. Donât test me.â\n\nâYouâll have no protection.â\n\nâIf this is what your protection looks like, then you can scamper right back to your nest, you *fucking* *dodo*.â\n\nHe pushed her into the fridge, making the cupboards rattle. Leah covered her throat and left. No smirk or snide comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJohn sat me down and gave me a hug. He handed me the towel that Leah had gotten for me, and helped me wrap it around my finger.\n\nâYouâre gonna be okay,â he said. âWeâre gonna fix this.â\n\nI hadnât seen him properly for some time. It wasnât until now that I saw he was in a rough shape.\n\nThe hair around his temples was falling off, revealing a scaly patchwork of dying skin. One of his eyes looked shrunken, and he couldnât open it. Heâd lost a lot of color, and I could smell something metallic on his breath. His tongue was almost grey, and I could see long strands of metal coming out of his skull; mixing into his hair. He grunted when he moved, and I could see the signs of immense joint pain.\n\nJohn wasnât doing well. Not well at all.\n\nâWhat did she make you do?â I asked, trying to keep my mind off the pain.\n\nâYou donât want to know,â he sighed. âBut itâs done. We canât be near those people.â\n\nâThereâs one less. She killed him.â\n\nâNot for long.â\n\nI didnât even question it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt last we had the place to ourselves. Roy didnât come around anymore, and Leah was adamant about staying away. We got the place until the Yearwalk was over, and John was trying his best to help me. Since my finger couldnât be recovered, he did what he could to help me heal. Even without his gadgets and machines, he was quite handy. Got me a cast and everything.\n\nIt was apparent that John wasnât getting his treatments; whatever those were. He was getting worse, and fast. Even though I was the one with a missing finger, John was in much worse shape.\n\nOver the next few days, Iâd see his joints lock up mid-stride, causing him to cramp and crash onto the floor. Once when he drank water, I saw steam coming out of his nose. At times I could hear a sizzling noise, and heâd lock himself in the bathroom. He did his best to stifle his cries of pain, but it was a small apartment; I heard everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess it came as no surprise that Oliver moved out. I didnât answer when he knocked on my door that last time. I was a hazard to him and all his friends, that much was certain. I wouldnât risk any of them a second time. \n\nJohn wasnât taking any chances. If it meant the two of us being locked inside that apartment for two months straight, he was fine with it. Going crazy together was better than being murdered. If we could just hold out a little longer, the Yearwalk would be over.\n\nThen again, by the look of it, Uncle John didnât have that kind of time left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor two weeks, we lived on nothing but old movies and take-away. John slept on the couch, while I got the bed. He made all arrangements on our single phone, not taking any chances by bringing in more devices than necessary. By now, I could see why John was quirky; he knew about the dangers that roamed out there. No wonder he made his own stuff and isolated himself. It mustâve taken him years to get to a point where he could sleep at night.\n\nI could tell John was getting worse, but he refused to talk about it. He couldnât open his one eye, and when he tried, I could hear some kind of mechanical whirr. Sometimes when he coughed, I could hear a metallic reverb. Some days heâd just stay on the couch, unable to move. Not just like in hurting too much to move, but in the literal sense that he couldnât.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy mid-November, it was clear that John wasnât going to make it much longer. He didnât sleep, eat, or drink. He could barely move. Even though he usually did so less than other people, now he wasnât doing it at all. His breathing was forced, and heâd stopped talking. There were these razor sharp metal flakes falling off of him, and I got cut a few times trying to clean them up.\n\nFinally, I sat down by his side and held his hand.\n\nIce cold.\n\nâJohn,â I said. âYouâ¦ you gotta help me. What can I do?â\n\nHe gestured with a finger for me to come closer. His voice was barely audible.\n\nâNoâ¦thing,â he wheezed. âDoâ¦ nothing.â\n\nA faint smile. He was asking me to let him pass. To stay there and wait for the year to be over, whatever the cost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah, no, that wasnât happening.\n\nWhat was he gonna do, stop me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tucked him in and put out a big glass of sugar water with a straw straight to his mouth. I took his phone and wallet; then I left the apartment for the first time in weeks. I could hear him wheezing. A weak protest. But I wouldnât let him die.\n\nWalking down the hall, I checked his phone. Several anonymous numbers saved, unmarked and never dialed. They could mean anything, and lead anywhere. But I had to try. \n\nThere was no one in the reception. No one in the hallways. No Leah, no Roy; just me and a phone. Stepping outside, it was already dark. I hadnât considered checking the time. Iâd stopped checking the time of day weeks ago; the days sort of blend together in isolation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA stiff breeze chilled me as I scrolled through the numbers. Nothing in particular stood out. None of them were local, or even recognizable. Maybe none of them would help. After all, if there was something that could be done, wouldnât John have done it already?\n\nI selected a number at random, and called. There was a short connection tone, then a click.\n\nSilence\n\nThen a warm breath, *creeping* into my ear canal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomewhere in the back of my mind, an image came to me. The image of a cold cliffside, leading to a raging sea. Dying November grass under my naked feet. And there, by the edge, a woman in white; asking us to die for her.\n\nAnd we all did.\n\nGladly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasnât my memory. It wasnât someone elseâs either. It was like an emotion, so specific in nature that I could summarize it in a made-up word that passed through my mind. A word that was whispered through my phone and nestled into my head.\n\nI dropped the phone, hearing only static on the other side. Static that resonated in my head, bouncing between my thoughts. A static with little secrets hidden to all but those forced to listen. I could hear her. Feel her. A calling for me to embrace her.\n\nAnd for a moment, I wanted to join them. I wanted to jump off that cliff.\n\nThen my world went dark, as I passed out in the parking lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course I was an idiot, but I had to try. Anything. Seeing John like that broke my heart. But waking up without the slightest idea of where you are, or how long youâve been there, is something you never get used to. It is one of the most disorienting things you can experience, and this was nothing short of a nightmare.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nâ*Kill me*,â something whispered.\n\nâ*Kill me, please*.â\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up.\n\nI thought Iâd gone blind. I blinked and blinked, but the room stayed dark. Damp, moist ground. Thick stone walls, choking all sound. My hands shackled to the wall, and my legs tied together. I could hear rattling chains.\n\nâ*Please, kill me, please*.â\n\nA second voice. Coarse. Old.\n\nâ*Kill me. Please, please*.â\n\nA third.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mustâve laid there for an hour or so; my head still spinning. Felt like vertigo, like standing at the edge of a cliff. I cursed myself. Iâd been so close to finishing this whole year, and this might be where it all came to an end. Taken into some underground madhouse and left to die.\n\nI mustâve laid there for hours. Then, a gasp. A group of people, gasping all at once.\n\nâ*Yes!*â they gasped. â*Yes, we will! Then, she will kill us! Yes, yes!*â\n\nA door swung open, blinding me. I could make out vague silhouettes of people. Naked men and women, young and old, covered in gashes, boils and dirt. All with the biggest smiles on their faces. Even there, blinded by the sudden light, I could see their pupils growing large with excitement.\n\nThey started grabbing me. Tearing at the chains. Shaking hands holding me with the strength of a primate.\n\nâ*Take him, yes. Yes, yes*!â\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to stay upright and walk on my own, but they were so eager to pull me along that they almost carried me. Six of them in total, but I could see more coming around. Iâd been locked in a root cellar in the middle of nowhere, and theyâd dragged me outside into the November sun.\n\nAt first I thought I was in a cornfield, but the color was off. My eyes had trouble adjusting.\n\nI could see more of them. At least 20. Some wore masks, muffling their voices. Others chirped, some croaked. One guy looked like he wore a boar mask, but it seemsed so real that he might as well have been an upright animal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could see them holding up cellphones. One of them held up a speaker. One held up a laptop. In the fields around us, I could see poles with speakers attached. Not a single power cable, but they were humming still.\n\nI felt like a lamb pushed to slaughter. Considering I was a Yearwalker, it might not be far from the truth. Maybe they were looking to kill me; to give me to whatever leader they worshipped. A free wish for whatever being could break me.\n\nThey held me down to the ground, pushing my face into the mud.\n\nAnd there she was.\n\nThe woman in white.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was about six feet tall and dressed in this luminescent white; matching her impossible skin tone. She held out her hands as if to embrace me, but nothing came of it.\n\nThen there was her face.\n\nA jumbled mess of moving cartilage, muscle, and exposed flesh. Not a single discernible tooth, eye, or facial structure. Just thisâ¦ mess, moving all on itsâ own. A den of vipers.\n\nShe spoke. Not through her mouth, but through every electronic device in the field. Every unpowered speaker, every cellphone; all of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nâ*You appear before the Blameless*.â\n\nAn excited rattle shook the field. Not just from the followers, but the field itself; shaking in response.\n\nâ*On the end of your path, I will cease your suffering. And with your end, I will bring that of others*.â\n\nShe turned towards her followers.\n\nâ*Soon, children. A blessing*.â\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA chorus of pleas. Bursting static. These broken and beaten madmen, begging for their idol to kill them; and she would not indulge. Instead, she laughed. Something in me remembered that laugh, as if Iâd heard it before. It was the same kind of feeling you get when you look at a branch, not sure if it is a snake or not. That terrible, sinking unease.\n\nMy eyes cleared as I looked around. This wasnât just any field.\n\nIt was all sunflowers. Blue ones.\n\nâ*Return him*,â she spoke. â*Prepare the Pacifier*.â\n\nHer voice came from everywhere. The field of blue sunflowers shivered and shook from her command. These dry plants, falling apart at the slightest motion, still couldnât help themselves.\n\nAnd neither could the madmen.\n\nThey dragged me back to the root cellar, locking me in this completely black room. Nothing but stone walls and a damp floor. I could hear them outside, praying. For death, for her, for some nonsense I couldnât even understand. And every now and then, I could hear her voice in the distance; resonating through whatever electronics these people had gathered. \n\nAnd the ground shivered, every time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to get out of my shackles, to fight back, to do something. But as day turned to night, only glimpses of light would come and go as they opened the door to throw me something barely edible, and a plastic water bottle. Whatever the âPacifierâ was, it took time to prepare. Days.\n\nEvery time that door opened, I winced. I imagined them dragging me out to be sacrificed, or lobotomizing me. I imagined them opening my ribcage and eating my heart. I could see their faces in my mindâs eye; frantic, unblinking, and ecstatic.\n\nBut as one day turned to several, it didnât seem like they were eager to kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIâve thought a lot about this since. I believe that whoever kills the Yearwalker doesnât just get a wish fulfilled; they take their place. Meaning they, too, can be hunted and killed. So what was happening here was, most likely, not mercy; but waiting for the year to come closer to an end, so that my killer would have no competition.\n\nAnd it got me thinking.\n\nWhat if that had been the strategy of others? There had been several people whoâd helped me, how could I trust that their true motive wasnât just to keep me alive long enough to take me out later?\n\nMaybe that was the plan. Maybe I was truly alone.\n\nAt the very least it felt that way, lying on the dirty floor for days on end, crying in the dark.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime passes differently in a place like that. Night and day were an illusion. I kept drifting in and out of sleep, swaying from exhausted to wide awake within what seemed like minutes. Sometimes my imagination would run so wild that Iâd trick myself into a hysterical panic.\n\nIt mightâve been weeks, but if Iâm honest I think it was, at most, a couple of days. One night, as I twisted and turned, I noticed one of my shackles bending differently when I put it at a certain angle. Using a rock and pushing at it, I managed to widen a gap big enough to slip my hands through. From there, I could untie my legs.\n\nBut that was it. How the hell do you get away from a place like that? There were always half a dozen people outside, waiting for me to do something stupid.\n\nWas escape even an option?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next time the door would open, Iâd be ready. I held the chains from my shackles as a weapon, ready to attack whoever came in. I mustâve stood there for hours, trying not to breathe too loudly. They might be mad and barely cognizant, but they were eager to please their mistress.\n\nSo I waited, and just like the madmen outside, I prayed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen light finally broke through the door, I swung. I swung so hard my arm nearly gave out. And as soon as the chain connected with something, I took off running.\n\nHe was a man in his 60âs, wearing some kind of tribal-inspired plastic mask made from a bent cutting board. Iâd hit him square in the throat, sending him gagging to the ground. I didnât even try to check on him; I just ran. But as I did, I could feel a desperate hand reaching for me; trying not to save his life, but to fulfill his order to stop me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was night, but I didnât care. This was my best shot to get away. I ran past nightmarish faces, smiling in a way that showed as much teeth as possible. Large, unblinking eyes almost shining white; even in the dark.\n\nI pushed past them, surprising them, and ran straight into the field of sunflowers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nâ*Thank you!*â I heard them screaming. â*She will reward me! Yes! The reward is mine!*â\n\nThey were laughing. Singing, whooping, and running with complete abandon to catch me. The dried and dying field collapsed before me, as rustling intensified behind me. They were gaining on me.\n\nSomething heavy flew past me. A rock, perhaps. I kept my head down and kept pushing forward, but it was getting harder and harder. It was as if the sunflowers were trying to stop me, getting so close to one another that I could almost climb on top of them.\n\nâ*I have the Pacifier!*â one of them cheered. â*I will be rewarded!*â\n\nOthers were excited. They all were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had countless little cuts across my legs and stomach as I kept trying to push through the field. Suddenly, something struck me. This enormous weight came down on my left shoulder blade, completely throwing me off balance.\n\nI tumbled to the ground, landing hard on my arm; the same arm where Iâd lost my ring finger. The pain was bad enough to knock the air out of me. I barely had time to react as someone straddled me. And before I had the chance to protest, something pierced my skin.\n\nSomething cold started running into me as I felt around for something to grab.\n\nFinally, my hands settled on whatâd hit me in the first place; this large, fist-sized rock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI swung it around, connecting with my assailant square in the face; knocking him off of me.\n\nWith my other hand, I pulled out whatâd been stuck into my chest; a syringe. Small, but surprisingly heavy. From the light of dozens of little screens, I could see them come towards me. I could see their excited faces. However, the man Iâd beaten didnât look enthused. No, he looked terrified.\n\nâNo,â he cried. âSheâ¦ *she* must kill me. Not you. Not you! Not!â\n\nRock in hand, I attacked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n48 hits.\n\nI counted them off, one by one. I could barely see his face in the dark, but with every hit the others stopped. They were eager to die, but not to me. Not like this. I killed that man without a second thought. With every hit his face disappeared into the gore and mud.\n\nWhen I finally got up, they all stood in a circle around me, shocked. They had never considered I might fight back. That I might take whatever paradise they envisioned from them.\n\nThey were just as afraid as I was; and yet, they couldnât leave.\n\nWe just stood there, looking at one another. And every time I turned away, I could hear them creeping up behind me. I saw the outlines of their homemade masks. Some, who chose not to wear one, had such a terrifying face that it was hard to tell if it was real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nâ*Pacify him*,â the woman in white spoke.\n\nThe voice echoed throughout the field, resonating through dying speakers and old phones. And those two words changed everything. Suddenly, the attack began anew. Throwing my rock, I heard it connect with something wooden. A mask, perhaps. Either way, it sent one of them sprawling to the ground, giving me an opportunity to run.\n\nA storm of voices, and a rumble overhead. They werenât gonna hesitate this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made my way to the tree line. Somewhere along the way, they lost sight of me, allowing me to stay low. Itâd started to rain; masking my movement further. Still, I could hear them skulking around, looking for me. And if I could hear them, they could probably hear me too.\n\nThe rain quickly picked up, turning into an ice cold downfall. It soaked into my clothes, making me shiver. I could feel a painful warmth radiating from where Iâd been struck with that syringe.\n\nNot to mention my messed-up shoulder. And my finger.\n\nGoddamn it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoving through a forest in the dark is a dumb idea. I stepped through all kinds of underbrush and uneven ground, almost breaking my leg. Getting stuck in roots, breaking branchesâ¦ thereâs no way to just be quiet, rain or no. And every time I gained ground, they picked up my trail. They were relentless, and there were more of them. Over a dozen.\n\nI finally made it onto a small dirt road. It wasnât much, but at least I could move a bit quieter. The rain was picking up, and I could hear the rumble of thunder.\n\nBut it didnât take long for them to follow. They figured it out, and they were eager to pick up the pace.\n\nI couldnât. I could barely go on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey were gaining on me fast, cheering all the way. And when a pain ran through my chest, I had to stop. I doubled over, sinking my knees into the wet mud. A flash of lightning lit up the sky, and for a moment, I saw all my assailants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheyâd stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got up on my feet and looked at them. All of them suddenly stopped. Was it the lightning?\n\nâIsâ¦ is that it?â I huffed. âYouâ¦ weâre done?â\n\nNo response. They just stared at me.\n\nâFuckâ¦ *fuck* you,â I spat.\n\nBut from behind me, further down the road, I heard a choking sound.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn another flash of lightning, I saw her.\n\nA grey hoodie, and a black pixie haircut. The escapee from the Hatchet base. And there she stood, drinking the rain.\n\n*We were on Hatchet ground.*\n\nWhat happened next was fast. They came out of the woods. Rain-drinkers and madmen, wrestling to the death in the downpour. I just stood there, watching chaos unfold around me. Masks breaking. Throats trying to inhale the rain. Choking, punching, kicking, strangling. It was brutal.\n\nAnd I had no intention of staying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I turned to run, I came face to face with the woman with the black pixie haircut. She put a single hand on my shoulder and tilted her head down to look at me. Our eyes met. She leaned in and tried to clear her throat. On the first try, nothing happened. But on the second, I could make out two words.\n\nâThank. John.â\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith her permission, I limped away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours passed, and so did my shivers. I felt this incredible warmth emanating from my chest. I wasnât tired, hungry, or thirsty anymore. I was justâ¦ decent. I could do this. Or maybe I couldnât. Maybe whatever theyâd shot into me just wanted me to think I was okay. Either way, I kept walking.\n\nI followed the small roads. I followed the highway. I kept going in a daze until early morning turned to afternoon. I had no idea how long Iâd been gone. For a short while, I could see my breath; but I wasnât cold. I was soaking wet and wounded, but I still felt okay.\n\nThat worried me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point, I started to recognize the area. I turned off to a side road, followed it, and realized where I was. I was just minutes away from where Evanâs house had been. From there, I could make my way back to town. I knew the way by heart.\n\nBy now, my legs were on auto pilot. And minutes later, I walked past the driveway to Evanâs yard.\n\nAnd saw, to my great surprise, that the house had returned.",

        "text": "Iâd started listening to it at the behest of my yoga teacher. She knew I struggled with anxiety and this was supposed to âbring light and calm to my inner space.â \n\nâItâs like an auditory Valium! Seriously. SO so soothing, girl. It just taps into something in the brain. Youâre doing it- okay? Iâll send you a promo code for a free month!â\n\nItâs not like Iâd never heard of white noise, or pink noise, or whatever-the-fuck, all the colors of the rainbow noise. Iâd tried listening to it before but I got bored and turned on Loretta Lynn instead. \n\nBut this- THIS app- was supposed to be different. And pink noise was going to change my life.\n\nI relented and thanked her for the free month before heading home.\n\nI took a bath and tried to decompress. I was anxious. Jumpy. Somewhere between âvague uneaseâ and a panic attack. What else was new. My phone dinged. Yoga teacher.\n\nâHave u tried it yet? Thoughts??â \n\nThe pink noise thing. Fuck it. Why not.\n\nI downloaded the app and chose my noise color. I pressed play and closed my eyes. \n\nIt was fine. Nice. Old school television static meets a heavy downpour. I sat with it for a while. Without noticing, I had unclenched my jaw and was breathing slower, deeper. I kept it playing as I got out of the tub and ready for bed.\n\nAn hour later, cozy and settled, I was officially on board the pink noise train. I lay there, snugly wrapped in my favorite blanket like a giant swaddled hot dog baby, and let the ambient static rainfall woosh me to sleep. Darkness. \n\nI woke with a start. An electric jolt ran through my body, like there was someplace I needed to be or something important I was supposed to be doing. I checked my phone. 1:30am. Ambient noise flooded my room. Had it always been this loud? And then, a faint whisper: \n\nâGo.â\n\nI swear to God, I heard it. A voice in the noise. \n\nâGo now.â\n\nThe hair on my arms stood up. I couldnât move. âIâm asleep. Iâm sleeping. This is a dream.â I repeated the words like a mantra. Silence in the noise. There was no voice. Just the steady, static âwoosh.â I exhaled. Minds play tricks when itâs late at night. \n\nâHeâs almost here.â\n\nThe whisper sounded more strained, urgent. \n\nâNO TIME.â\n\nMy arms and legs went numb. Terror surged through my veins and intensified with every beat of my heart. And then, at once a whisper and a scream:\n\nâOUT!â\n\nâOUT!â\n\nâOUT!â\n\nI shot out of bed, survival mode and adrenaline propelling me forward. Like any good millennial, otherworldly voice screaming at me to âGO!!â or not, I remembered my phone. I ran down the stairs, through my kitchen, grabbing my keys off the hook by the garage door. Thatâs when I saw it. A figure standing, silent and still, in the doorway leading to the back patio. The sliding door wide open. A man. âHim.â He was inside. He held something shiny in his hand. All the air left the room. All I heard was pink noise and the voice: \n\nâOUT!â\n\nSo I did. I flung open the door and ran to my car. Locked the doors. Fled and called the police. I met them at the station and gave my statement. I omitted the part where I was saved by a ghost in my white noise app. \n\nThey searched my home and the woods around my property. They found shoe prints. The M.O. and the prints matched a serial predator who targeted women in my area. Heâd killed the woman before me. Another ninety seconds, and I would have joined her. They found the guy that night, walking along a busy highway. Drivers called it in. He was holding something shiny in his hand.\n\nI canât fall asleep anymore without my pink noise. And I know that whatever, whoever, abides watchfully in the color-coded frequencies, I am safe, and I am loved.",

        "text": "Itâs taken me a long time to be able to talk about this publicly. For a while, I didnât speak at all. Not a word to anybody. I told the police what happened a hundred times, and eventually I was so numb that I felt like I lost the ability. I didnât have enough energy in my body to push words out. Itâs an indescribable type of emptiness. \n\nAt the request of law enforcement as well as a last ditch effort to convince anyone that what I saw really happened, I'm going to do my best to recount the events that happened that day. Unfortunately, I watched almost the entire thing unfold.\n\nSo, me and my fiancÃ© Ann, were going through a bit of a rough patch. Some days we were great, but others we were like strangers. \n\nThe last day we spent together, I cooked her dinner and she refused to eat a bite. I spent half the day cooking. I looked up a fancy recipe to impress her. She wanted none of it. I couldnât figure out what was wrong with her.\n\nDespite a promise I had made to her, I went out to my car and started taking sips off of a bottle of rum I had hidden there. My drinking was often an issue between us. I always dealt with lots of anxiety and depression and. It made me feel numb. It allowed me to turn my mind off for a little while at a time. At least I told myself that..\n\nShe didnât understand why I needed that. I made her feel like she was not enough. The reason was the opposite though. I wasnât enough for her. She had a good job. She was beautiful. She was intelligent. Iâm none of these things and at the time I was unemployed. I was unemployed more often than not during our time together. I felt inadequate. \n\nShe said that I didnât listen enough and that I had a complete inability to listen when I was drinking. The last day we spent together, I tried to cook her a gourmet meal because she had mentioned it a few days prior. She said she was sick of eating the same things day in and week out. She painted us as an old couple sitting in lazy boys with our TV dinners repeating the same day over and over. I found this to be a vast exaggeration, but maybe she was somewhat right.\n\nIn any case, we decided to take some time apart. I moved in with my buddy Eric. The last real friend I had. I lost touch with the rest after I started seeing Ann. Eric was ride or die though and was happy to help, at least for a few weeks. He had an extra room and it was a nice set up. It was just far away from her though. Too far for my comfort. \n\nI regularly tried to call her, but she wouldnât answer. That was painful. Being locked out by the person you love is justâ¦ tough. \n\nI was desperate for a way to contact her or see her but I knew she didnât wanna see me. Then one day, I remembered the cameras.\n\nIt was a Christmas gift from a family member a while back. A set of security cameras that we could check and monitor from our phones and tablets. We set up one outside and two inside just by the doorway, pointing in separate directions.  After that, we pretty much forgot about them. \n\nOur neighborhood was safe. We barely had any neighbors, none that you can see from our house. The closest place was around the bend. Our place was quiet and private. I liked that. In any case, we didnât feel like we had much of a need for security cameras. \n\nI felt a rush of excitement when I remembered the cameras. I got my tablet out and got on the app. I looked at the monitor, and there she was. She looked beautiful. She was dressed really nice and I worried that she might have a date. It hurts a lot to lose someone you love. Seeing them with someone else is torture.. \n\nI felt creepy, believe me. I didnât want to stalk her or watch her without her knowledge. I just wanted to see her from time to time. I just checked once in a while, just so I could see her face.\n\nIt was only a week or so between me leaving and what happened. I just checked the cameras a few times. I couldnât get it off my mind though so I turned notifications on for the app. I didnât wanna spy on her, but I had to know if she was seeing someone. If someone came to the door, I would get a notification.\n\nEventually, I got a notification. I opened the app to see that there was a man at the door. Immediately, my heart sank. She was seeing someone. That was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction though.\n\nI watched the footage as she opened the door. It turned out that it was a door to door salesman. An odd little man with a goofy mustache. He was dressed very oddly also. Suspenders over a purple dress shirt and a top hat wielding a unicycle. \n\nShe opened the door and pretty quickly told him she wasnât interested in buying anything. \n\nâYou donât know what Iâm selling yet though, maâam,â the salesman said. \n\nâSo what are you selling?â Ann asked. \n\nâUnicycles!â He gleefully replied. \n\nAnn laughed. The salesman shrugged as if he was used to this response. \n\nâIâm sorry, but I donât need a new unicycle at the moment,â she laughed. \n\nâI think you do.â The salesman said as his demeanor changed from upbeat to almost sinister. âCan I trouble you for a glass of water?â  \n\nAnn seemed flustered by the request. I immediately became concerned and tried to call her. Iâd be lying if I said that it didnât hurt to watch her on the camera look at her phone and then silence the ringer.. \n\nAfter she ignored my call, she invited the salesman in. I was stunned. No one sells unicycleâs door to door! Why is she letting this man into the house!\n\nI tried calling again. Then I texted. Then I called again. She continued to ignore me. I decided to drive over there. Something was off. Something was up with this guy.\n\nFrom the place where I was staying, it would normally take about 40 minutes to drive to Annâs place. Not that day though.. I hit a traffic jam pretty quickly. Apparently, there had been an accident somewhere up the highway and we were at a standstill. \n\nI called and called again but she would not answer me. I used my tablet to periodically check the camera. I had a good data plan for the tablet so I could keep the camera on as long as it would hold a charge. My phone was dying though. \n\nAs traffic came to a complete halt, I started watching the camera closely again. She had invited him into the kitchen where they were sitting and talking as he drank his water. She then excused herself to use the bathroom. \n\nFrom where the cameras were  positioned, I could see the doorway and a bit of the living room on one, The front porch and the woods across the street on another, and most of the kitchen from the last one. I kept watching the salesman in the kitchen while she was in the bathroom. \n\nHe sat still for a few moments, but then he got up and started slowly walking around the kitchen. He made his way to the sink and refilled his water glass. Then he stopped at the knife block. \n\nMy heart rate exploded when he took one of the knives out of the block. He slid his finger along the blade. He then put it back and did the same with another one of the knives. After the third one, he turned around quickly as if he heard something, he put the knife back, and he quickly sat back down where he was when she left the room. \n\nThis is when I entered full panic mode. I had cars on every side of me and couldnât escape the traffic jam. Ann would not answer the phone. I felt helpless. \n\nI tried to call her yet again and this time it went straight to voicemail. She had either blocked me or turned off her phone. I tried two more times with no luck. I sat there freaking out when she didnât answer and realized that it was time to call the police.\n\nIt was like it was fate. I ended my latest attempted call to Ann, and started dialing 911. Thatâs when my phone died..\n\nI knew that I would have to go car to car begging a pissed off stranger in a traffic jam to let me use their phone to call the police. Before I embarked on this journey, I looked at the camera again from the tablet. \n\nWhat I saw made me feel sick.. They were kissing.. I couldnât believe what I was seeing. This clown shows up at the doorstep with his suspenders and his top hat and his fucking unicycle, and she brings him inside our home to hook up with him? \n\nI didnât know who the hell this person was. Iâm not talking about the unicycle salesman. Iâm talking about Ann. Shy, sweet, intelligent, Ann. This just wasnât her. Any random hook up doesnât seem like something she would do, but especially this guy.. This stranger who showed up at our house selling something he knows nobody is going to buy. \n\nAnn is The furthest thing from a âditzâ. Cheesy lines didnât work on her. Pick up lines didnât work on her. She preferred intelligent and engaging conversations. She simply wasnât dumb enough to believe that this guy was really selling unicycles! \n\nWhen they finally stopped making out, they went back to the kitchen. He again went to the knife block and pulled a knife out. My heart raced, and I prepared to get out of the car to start begging someone for their phone to call the police. Then he spoke. \n\nâAre you gonna let me cook for you tonight?â He asked. \n\nShe smiled and said âI thought we could have something delivered.â \n\nI was totally confused. Has she been seeing this guy? Has this been going on since before I left? I never even considered checking the cameras before. I canât now. They donât record unless you set them to. We live in a nice neighborhood. I never had a reason to suspect her of infidelity. I just didnât get it.\n\nI felt numb watching them, but I couldnât look away. A hurricane of pain and confusion swirled in my head. Why the suspenders? Why the salesman ruse? Was she into some sort of bizarre role-playing? Is that why I wasnât satisfying her?\n\nI felt sick, but a bit relieved at the same time. I was angry. That didnât mean that I wanted to watch her get attacked by a madman though. Apparently, she knew this goofy fucking unicycle salesman and apparently he made her happy.. \n\nI kept the tablet on, but tried not to look as often. I was torn. I didnât want to see it but I couldnât look away. I figured since I wouldnât be driving for a while, I could take a few sips off of my rum that I had stashed in the car from before. \n\nI sat there trying to drown my sorrows. I watched them discuss what to order for dinner. I watched as she turned her phone back on and laughed at how many times I had called and texted. I was pathetic to her, and maybe she was right. Although I also thought she was too good for me, and maybe I was wrong..\n\nI decided to shut the tablet off and stop torturing myself. The traffic was still completely stalled. Every song that came on the radio made me think of Ann even though she barely liked music in general. I used to think it was the strangest thing about her. Everything would always remind me of her though. \n\nAbout a half hour went by before I got a notification on the tablet. Their food had arrived. They ordered pizza. Of course Ann would never eat pizza with me. It was always salad or something healthy. Actually looking back, she barely ate at all. \n\nI watched as she opened the door, searched her pockets, then invited the pizza guy into the doorway while she got her wallet. \n\nShe walked out of frame and he seemed to be talking to her. Thatâs when things took a horrifying turn.. \n\nThe unicycle salesman came into frame and slowly approached the pizza guy from behind. He was holding the unicycle. He lifted the unicycle, holding the bar just below the seat. Then he struck the pizza guy in the back of the head with the other end. \n\nI panicked as I watched. The pizza guy fell to the floor and the unicycle salesman pounced on his back. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a syringe. He quickly jabbed it into the guy's neck.. \n\nMoments later, Ann walked back into frame. The salesman looked up at her with a smile on his face and said âNot too messy, right?â He then pulled a pistol out from his pocket and said âI told you I wouldnât need the gun.â \n\nKnowing Ann, I expected her to scream in fear and start running out of the house, realizing that she had invited a psychopath inside. Instead, she laughed and said âBetter to have it and not need it.â\n\nI had no idea what to do. I worried that she was in danger. I would have never expected in a million years that she would hurt somebody. It was like this creepy unicycle salesman had her hypnotized. It simply wasnât her.. \n\nLooking at the tablet, I couldnât believe my eyes. The pizza boy was lying unconscious on the floor as Ann and the salesman both stepped out of frame. \n\nThey both re-entered at the same time from desperate directions. The salesman walked out to the front porch where he grabbed a duffel bag that was sitting there on the porch. I hadnât noticed the bag before. \n\nAnn returned from somewhere further in the house carrying what looked like a tarp.. The salesman set the bag down and took the tarp from Ann. He spread it out on the ground next to the pizza guy. Then, together they both rolled him onto the center of the tarp.\n\nThe salesman grabbed the duffel bag and knelt down next to the unconscious pizza guy. Ann gave him a kiss and smiled before saying âIâll get the kitchen ready.â \n\nI was baffled.. absolutely baffled. Baffled doesnât do the feeling justice. There are no words to describe how I felt when I watched what they were doing and what they were about to do.. Not only to see something so horrifying in general, but to know that I was living with this person. This person I loved and thought I knew was capable of.. \n\nSorry.. I had to take a quick break there.. I'm going to do my best to explain what I saw next.. \n\nShe uh.. She started pulling pots and pans out of the cupboard. She grabbed some spices off the rack and some butter from the fridge. She set a pan on the stove and started the burner before throwing in some butter.. \n\nI was so focused on her. I was so confused. It was a lot to see all at once. I was so focused on her that I didnât see what the salesman was doing in the other room.. \n\nWhen I switched back to the other camera, all I could see was the salesman hovering over the Pizza guy. He was now wearing what looked like a garbage bag over his clothes. It wasnât until he moved a little that I realized what he was doing.. \n\nThe moment I saw it and realized what he was doing, I opened the car door and vomited. After that, I grabbed some napkins from the glove box  and wiped my face as I tried to catch my breath and combat the quickly oncoming panic attack.. I had no idea that it was about to get even worse.. \n\nI need another breakâ¦ \n\nWhat I had seen on the camera was the unicycle salesmanâ¦ cutting the pizza guy. Not just cutting.. Chopping.. Flaying.. Dismembering.. he was chopping him up.. The duffel bag was full of knives, saws, ect. iâve never seen something so disgusting in my entire life. Nothing close.. \n\nI didnât want to look at the camera again. I had to know though. It was like a train wreck. I didnât know what to do. I was stuck in my car. My phone was dead. For a moment, I tried to convince myself it wasnât even really happening. Maybe I had completely lost my mind. That wouldâve been preferable..\n\nWhen I finally looked back at the camera, I watched as the salesman pulled off chunks of flesh and placed them into containers.. heâs sawed and hacked as Ann acted perfectly normal in the kitchen like she was about to prepare dinner. \n\nAfter a few minutes, I could see the salesman get up, pick up one of the full, blood soaked containers, and walk it into the kitchen.. \n\nSomehow I still had hope that Ann was the person I knew at that point. I prayed that she would scream when the man walked in with his container of human meat.. she smiled though.. she smiled in a way I have never seen her smile before. It looked soâ¦ sinister.. The same look the unicycle salesman had on his face when he first showed up.. \n\nHe set the container on the counter.. She umm.. she started grabbing bits and throwing them into the pan.. They both smiled and he gave her a little kiss before returning to the other room to.. finish.. \n\nHe started walking out of the kitchen before turning around. He asked Ann, âDo you have records? I saw the turntable in the living room. Some music would be nice.â \n\nAnn told him that she did have records in the cabinet under the turntable. She lied. She doesnât have records. I do. That turntable is probably the only thing of mine she allowed in the house. The one thing she allowed me to have of my own.\n\nAs I said before, Ann didnât really like any music. Once in a while sheâd get into one of the new top 40 pop hit songs, but that was about it. She told the salesman the records were hers though. \n\nHe walked to the turntable. âWhat should we listen to?â He asked.\n\nâUp to you,â she replied. \n\nâOhh how about The Misfits!?â He asked excitedly.\n\nâOh is that punk or heavy stuff?â Ann replied. âIâd like to listen to something a little more upbeat.â \n\nâFair enough,â the salesman replied. He then knelt down next to the body of the pizza guy and said âYeah, sorry buddy. That was my first choice too. Hey, if I cut off your arms and cut off your legs, would you still love me anyway?â He then laughed and continued looking through the records.\n\nBefore long, he made another selection. He didnât ask Annâs opinion this time. He selected a record and put it on the table. Before he turned it on, he walked back into the kitchen. \n\nâI found something perfect!â He said. âI gotta stop wasting time though. Our friend only has one more delivery. I texted the number saying their pizza would be late so theyâd get it free so hopefully it bought us some time. I gotta get moving on this though.â\n\nâTry a bite first,â Ann said with a smile as she continued flipping the bits of meat in the pan. \n\nâOkay but quickly,â the salesman replied. âHold on one second.â \n\nHe scurried into the living room and turned on the turntable. He put the stylus down and headed back into the kitchen. \n\nThe music started playing. It was âIâm into something good.â It was the original version by The Cookies. More specifically, Earl Jean McCrea. A good song that is forever ruined for me now..I guess that isnât important. It just made the scene so much more eerie and bizarre.. \n\nThe song started as Ann got a piece of meat out of the pan with a fork. She fed the bite to the salesman. My stomach turned again. She then took a bite, herself. It was beyond horrific.. They ate bits of this presumably innocent pizza guy as upbeat music played in the background.\n\nThe salesman gave Ann a kiss on the cheek, then returned to the pizza guy on the floor. He continued cutting pieces off as Ann continued cooking. All while âSomethin tells me Iâm into something goodðµâ continued playing. \n\nIt was like watching a twisted montage. I couldnât look away. The police have asked me why I didnât get out of the car right then and there to beg someone for their phone to call the police. Why did I watch for so long..\n\nI have difficulty answering that.. I pretty much did. It just took me a minute.. I  was practically in a trance.. itâs difficult to process things in real time, especially something like this.. This brutal, horrific sight playing out to a happy go lucky sounding song that I used to really enjoy.. Itâs just.. It was just a lot. Too much for my psyche to handle.. Eventually, I turned off the tablet screen before opening the door to dry heave.\n\nThis is when I got out of the car again. I needed to contact the police. I tried to get one of the other cars around me to roll down the window for me to explain and ask to use the phone, but no one would. \n\nThey assumed I was some madman who jumped out of his car in the middle of a traffic jam. These people were already irritated and I was trying to knock on their windows. To them, I was just a nut job holding a tablet with a violent video playing on it.. \n\nDespite several people laying on their horns and yelling out their windows at me to get back into my car, I decided to run up the road. I knew I was roughly a mile from the accident and that there would have to be law-enforcement there. \n\nAs I ran, people beeped their horns at me, yelled things at me, threw things at me.. I didnât care. I needed to find help. \n\nI periodically looked back at the tablet. It didnât get any less disgusting. By now, the salesman had removed limbs from the Pizza guy.. He started loading the containers into a cooler.. Our cooler.. The same cooler that Ann and I took camping last summer.. She complained the entire time on that trip. I thought she would enjoy being in nature, but she must have been fantasizing about.. something else..\n\nI didnât want to switch back to the camera that could see the kitchen, but I couldnât help myself. Just then though, traffic started moving. I looked up ahead and still wasnât close enough that I could see the accident site or any police cars. Traffic quickly got back to normal speeds and I realized that they had cleared the road.\n\nI decided to run back to my car. It was blocking traffic. I didnât know how far I was from the accident scene or if there would still be police there when I got there. I sprinted back to my car as fast as I could. When I finally made it back to it, there were several cars stuck behind it trying to merge into the other lane. People were still beeping and yelling.\n\nI jumped in as fast as I could and pulled out. I continued driving toward Annâs house, though I wasnât sure what to do at this point.\n\nWhen I made the mistake of looking back at the tablet, I tried my best not to puke again.. unsuccessfully.. This is verifiable. Police know that I absolutely did puke into the passenger seat of my car while driving. Not a pleasant experience.. none of this was.\n\n/(:(/(:(:(:(:):)When I looked back, they were both in the kitchen. She was frying upâ¦pieces... They were pulling off little pieces of meat out of the pan and they started feeding it to each other. \n\nIt was sick and disgusting and bizarre. He caressed her leg as he fed her a piece. She kissed his neck and rubbed his thigh as she fed him a piece. I again vomited into the passenger seat while trying not to wreck my car.. \n\nI continued heading toward Annâs house. I didnât know where else to go in the area. I guess I should have gone to the police station. I think I was in shock though. I wasnât thinking clearly.. How could I?\n\nI was still about a half hour away. I continuously made the mistake of looking at the tablet to see their horrific feast. I tried to keep the screen off because the tablet was now running out of battery. I decided to drive straight there rather than stopping at the one single tiny gas station between Annâs and where I was. It was getting late and it seemed like the place was always closed either way.\n\nI was about 10 minutes away when I couldnât help myself but check again. They looked like they were finishing up for the moment. They were no longer eating. They were having a discussion. \n\nAnn said, âI canât wait for dessert!â  \n\nThe unicycle salesman replied, âJust let me deliver the next pizza on our new friends route. Iâll call you when Iâm ready to ditch the car. Meet me at the place we discussed. Then we can come back here for a real meal!â \n\nAnn smiled and agreed. The salesman then rolled the remains of the pizza guy in the tarp. He bound it together with bungee cords. Then he dragged the pizza guy out of the house and put him in the trunk of his own car. After that, he drove away.. \n\nI was about to switch back to the kitchen camera when the tablet died. I felt angry, but a little relieved that I didnât have to watch anymore. Still, I felt the need to confront her. My mind was blown and my world was upside down.. She owed me a hell of an explanation.. So I went to her house.. \n\nI arrived about ten minutes after the tablet died. I wasnât sure if sheâd still be there. Her car was there though. \n\nI got out and approached the front door. I was still in a state of panic. I tried to take deep breaths as I rang the doorbell. \n\nI waited, but there was no response. I tried the door and was surprised that it was unlocked. I slowly walked into the house. The smell was the first thing I noticed.. \n\nIt kind of smelled like pork. Almost metally too. Metallic? I donât know, I thought it kind of smelled like metal. Maybe I was just about to have a stroke from the stress, the horror, the confusion. I guess thatâs burnt toast though, right? Doesnât matter. Iâm rambling. Iâd prefer to talk about absolutely anything other than this..\n\nThe music was still playing as I slowly walked in. The same song actually. It was an EP. Thereâs only two songs on it. The cheery song made me feel even more uneasy as I approached the kitchen. \n\nâWoke up this morning feeling fine 'Cause there was something special on my mind\n\nLast night I met a new boy in the neighborhood..â\n\nMaybe the lyrics convey how Ann felt. \n\nâWe only talked for a minute or two\n\nAnd it felt like I knew him the whole night through\n\nI don't know if people fall in love\n\nBut he's everything I've been dreaming of..â \n\nSorry.. I donât know why I keep singing that song.. I hate that song now.. I think Iâm just trying to distract myself. I really donât want to continue.. \n\nI will continue.. I wouldnât want to obstruct an investigation.. \n\nSo, I walked into the kitchen and there she was. She was sitting at the table peacefully looking down at an empty plate.. She didnât have much of a reaction to seeing me. She didnât seem mad that I had shown up unannounced or that I walked in when no one answered the door. Actually, she looked more at peace in that moment than she ever did when we were together..\n\nâHi Ann..â I said nervously. \n\nâWhat a surprise,â she calmly replied. âYou really canât just show up like this.â\n\nâI uh.. Sorry..â I struggled to find the words when I was finally face-to-face with her. \n\nâWhat brings you by?â She asked, still as calm and emotionless as before. \n\nâThere was an accident.. and umm.. I was worried.. I.. What are you eating?â\n\nHer cocky smirk left her face for a moment. It was chilling. The way she looked at me.. \n\nâIâm not eating anything right now,â she replied. \n\nâWhat were you eating!?â I asked in a more assertive tone.\n\nâBeef!â She laughed. âWhat is it to you?â \n\nThere was a long pause. She sat there awaiting my response. I had difficulty figuring out how to say it. Itâs like the words were stuck..\n\nâAnn.. What the hell is going on with you.?â\n\nâYouâre the one showing up here, letting yourself in,â she said. \n\nI finally just blurted it out. âWhat the hell did I just witness? What just happened here? I need you to explain to me what I just watched on the cameras.,â\n\nâThe cameras?âl she started to ask, but quickly realized what I was talking about. She had forgotten about them too. \n\nâYouâve been spying on me?â She asked. \n\nâNo. Donât worry I havenât been watching you day in and day out. I havenât been stocking or spying I swearâ¦ All I saw was what happened here tonightâ¦ and I really need an explanation for that shit..â\n\nâYouâre so dramatic,â she said, laughing. \n\nâYouâre kidding, right?â I said. I was getting angrier. That cocky look on her face just.. I asked her again.\n\nâWhat was that!?â\n\nâIâve told you before that I wanted to try new things,â she said in the most irritating way possible.  \n\nâNew things?! I thought you meant a trip! Maybe a fancy dinner! Not attacking an innocent person with a fucking Willy Wonka impersonator! And especially not..â\n\nI couldnât say it, but I gestured to the stove. \n\nâNew things,â she said quietly. âItâs kind of hard to explain. I guess itâs the taboo aspect.. Itâs not sexual.. not all sexual. Itâs about pushing boundaries. Iâve been realizing that the society we live in just isnât for me. I want to try things that people arenât supposed to.. We find it strange because weâre taught to find it strange.. Itâs rules ingrained in us. Those rules arenât natural..â\n\nI interrupted and said âYou sound like a drug addict right now, whoâs saying something you think is profound when itâs really just nonsense to justify doing something shitty,â\n\nShe ignored what I said and continued her rant. âI think itâs a primal thing. We want what we canât have. A child doesnât want a toy until they see another kid playing with it. The girl doesnât want the guy until she thinks she canât have him.. â\n\nShe continued, but this was when I recognized Annâs trademark âramble away from the pointâ thing. Her eyes began to wander as well. \n\nThatâs when I saw him.. There was a chrome colored toaster on the counter. Itâs ironic to think about it now, but I wanted the black one. Ann always gets her way though, so we ended up with the reflective chrome.\n\nAs her eyes moved to where he was standing, I noticed the reflection of the unicycle salesman in the toaster. He was a few steps behind me, slowly approaching.\n\nI pretended to not notice for a moment. I then saw him lift the unicycle over his head like he did with the pizza guy. As soon as he began to swing, I ducked and dropped to the floor.\n\nHe barely missed my head. I kicked the nearest chair into him, got up and ran. \n\nHe was blocking the hallway to the front door, so I ran toward the back. I could hear him kick the chair away and start running after me. I frantically tried to quickly open the back door, but it was locked and latched. In a panic, I ran upstairs.\n\nI need to take a break here to explain. The police donât understand why I didnât just unlock the back door. Thereâs two locks and a chain lock on that door. I knew from before that the salesman had a gun. I was in a frenzied panic and he was right behind me. I heard him say âI bet you taste like candy..â and I just panicked and ran upstairs..\n\nI ran into our.. Sorry, Annâs bedroom. I didnât recognize it.. It hadnât even been that long, but she had erased any trace of me ever having lived there.. Sorry.. Thatâs not important.\n\nI ran into the room and slammed the door shut. There was a lock but it barely worked. All you had to do was jiggle the handle and Ann knew that. I knew she had a gun in her bedroom though. \n\nWe had actually argued about it before. I donât like guns. I never have. I told her that having one in the house would make it more likely that one of us would end up getting shot. As Iâve said before though, Ann gets what Ann wants.. I came home one day and there it was. \n\nThe best I could get her to do was compromise and get a safe for it. She begrudgingly agreed to that. It was now working against me though.\n\nI knew the combination, but I was so panicked and afraid for my life that I couldnât stop my hands from shaking. I could hear the salesman stomping down the hall before he started banging on the bedroom door.\n\nI took deep breaths as I got the first two numbers, then accidentally passed the third. My heart sank as I started over. As I frantically tried a second time to the sound of banging on the door, I yelled âLeave me alone!â \n\nThe banging stopped as I got the safe open and grabbed the gun. I went to flip the safety off but it already was off, of course.. I faintly heard Annâs voice say âJust jiggle it,â referring to the door lock.. \n\nIt hurt to hear her say that.. Even after everything I had witnessed.. Even after realizing that she had been living a lie.. There was a madman trying to kill me.. and she was helping him do that.. \n\nMoments later, the door nob started jiggling. I knew he was about to get in.. I knew he had a gun.. I knew he was a psychopath.. \n\nI heard the lock click after a few seconds. I sat against the nightstand next to the bed. I held the gun tightly with both hands and pointed it at the door.. The door started to open.. I winced, and I pulled the trigger.. \n\nMy eyes were barely open as I heard the body hit the floor by the doorway. I felt frozen at first. I didnât want to move. I didnât want to look.. I didnât realize at first that it wasnât the unicycle salesman.. It was Ann..\n\nI screamed when I realized it was her. I knew it was the salesman who was banging on the door. I heard his voice.. She must have moved him out of the way to open it herself.. It was another habit of hers. She could never just tell you how to do something if you asked. Sheâd take over and do it herself.. I shouldâve realized that.. \n\nI ran over to her as soon as I realized it was her. When I got to her, I could see the salesman running down the stairs. He was a coward.. He hit the pizza guy from behind. He tried to hit me from behind. He ran off when Ann was hurt.. \n\nI wished that she was only hurt.. I tried to put pressure on the wound. I immediately grabbed her phone and called the police. She was unresponsive and unconscious from the moment I got to her.. I tried cpr and applying pressure right up until the paramedics and police arrived. \n\nThey uh.. They ya know.. pronounced her.. moments after they got there.. please.. One more quick break.. \n\nI immediately told the police about the unicycle salesman. They werenât buying it. They didnât wanna hear it. Maybe they could have caught up with him if they had taken me seriously. He didnât exactly blend in.. They could have found him. They felt that they already had their guy though.. Me.\n\nThatâs umm.. Thatâs how it happened.. I didnât know anything about this unicycle salesman or any other guy sheâd been talking to prior to this. She never once mentioned having a desire to break taboos.. it was an absolute shock to me and on top of losing her and trying to process everything that happened, now I have to try to prove my innocence.. \n\nNo I donât like to generalize, but in my experience, once the police have a theory, they arenât happy about it being challenged. They like for things to be easy for them. Itâs a lot easier to pin this on the âjealous exâ, than find the real culprit. \n\nSorry.. I was.. I am frustrated about that.. They could have gotten him.. Who knows where he is now.. what heâs doing.. He could be chatting online with the next person heâs planning on brainwashing. He did brainwash Ann.. She may have had issues, but he caused what happened.. and he got away.. \n\nThey believe that the unicycle salesman was a creation by me, intended to be so bizarre that they would never believe I would make it up.. I wish that were true.. Then I wouldnât have to constantly wonder where he is and what heâs doing.. \n\nOne officer interrupted me as I was telling them about the salesman and said âLet me guess. You canât make this stuff up.â \n\nI never said that. I hate when people say that. You can make up anything. Writers like Isaac Asimov or HP Lovecraft âmade upâ entire worldâs and galaxies and universes.. \n\nSomeone who sincerely says  âyou canât make this upâ, is either lying about what they just told you, or theyâre very unimaginative. \n\nThe cops are suspicious of how I acted that day.. No one can say what they would do in a hypothetical situation.  This is something the police are struggling to grasp.. Opening the lock to a back door or to a gun safe seems simple until youâre under intense, life-threatening circumstances.\n\nThey asked why I never hit record on the cameras. I get that. I was just stunned. My mind was going a million miles an hour. I was having a panic attack. I was puking. I was just too panicked to stop and think clearly. \n\nThey asked why I didnât use someone elseâs phone to call the police earlier. Ask the other people in the traffic jam that question.. I tried. Maybe itâs because of people like the unicycle salesman, People donât trust people.. and anymore Iâm not sure that they should.\n\nOne of them even suggested that I did it to make some point about gun control? That one is so idiotic and ridiculous that I donât even want to dignify it with a response.\n\nThey said that no one else saw the unicycle salesman. it was clear that he knew Ann beforehand.. He wasnât actually going door to door\n\nI donât know how he got there. My biggest regret is never hitting record on the camera. There wasnât room in my mind for that thought at the time. \n\nI didnât see him walk up. I donât know if he got dropped off or had a car around the bend. Maybe he rode his stupid goddamn unicycle all the way there? I donât know! I donât know why he dressed that way. I donât know if it was part of the whole ritual or something he normally wears..\n\nThe police interviewed the people who had a pizza delivered after Annâs house. They described the delivery person as having curly hair and a mustache. They said he didnât talk much and kept the brim of his hat pulled low. It sounds more like the unicycle salesman, but the police dismiss it because I could have worn a fake mustache and wig? The answers they got didnât support their theory, so they werenât interested. \n\nAgain, it sounds like they want it to be me because itâs easier for them.. They already have me. I havenât been taken into custody but if I leave the county theyâll arrest me in a heartbeat. \n\nAs for my phone dying at the very moment I tried to call 911, what can I say? Itâs just the type of thing that happens to me. âOf courseâ moments. Those moments where things go perfectly wrong at specifically the right time.. My life is full of them. \n\nLook.. I can only tell you what happened. This is what happened. They asked about my alibi over and over. They interrogated me for hours. They even played âIâm into something goodâ on repeat for a while to âgauge my reaction..â After what I had seen and been through, I consider that torture.. \n\nI could go on and on about the police and how they have behaved throughout all of this, but thereâs no use for that. Soon, theyâll get the autopsy back. They will see the contents of Annâs stomach.. Maybe some evidence from the Pizza guys car or something else like that could prove my innocence..\n\nBut for now.. I live in a state of paranoia.. I sit and wonder if or when the police will come and arrest me for a horrific crime I didnât commit. Mostly though, I think about him.. I thought I saw him a few times for brief moments. Probably my mind playing tricks on me or maybe ptsd.. Iâm just so paranoid that the unicycle salesman will come back.. \n\nI do apologize if I rambled a bit at the end there. Iâm not sure how much longer Iâll be able to tell the story the way it actually happened. I need someone to know, even if they canât help me. \n\nI'll address any questions people may have in the comments as long as I have the freedom to do so. I will also try to update if there are any new developments. If I don't update, I guess you can assume that the police decided to charge me.. or that the unicycle salesman came back.. \n\nOne last thing. They found a full, uneaten pizza at Ann's. If I had been there earlier, that wouldn't have been the case...\n\nI really am just trying to get the truth out there. I want people to believe that I'm innocent, but mostly I want them to know that he's out there. He's real, and he could be brainwashing your significant other right now.. Or maybe he'll just show up at the front door.. If he does.. For the love of god.. don't let him in..",

        "author": "BurntSchmidt",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10n2eci/the_chase/",
        "text": "Story and narration by Erica M.  Thank you for the story. \n\n'My mother, during her tenure at Pitt, had once shared an apartment in lower Oakland with her best friend. One night she was awakened from a dream, only to find the source of it, a tall man in a brimmed rain hat, brooding over top of her with fiery eyes and knotted lips, curled into a baleful sneer which, if it had been a cartoon, might have been as humorous as it was terrifying. The ineffable expression on his face, his lurching, Marfan-like posture, and bulging, shadow-casted eyes instilled in her an irrational fear she would pass on to her children as an indisputable tenet - sleep with a weapon. Always.  Baseball bat, fire poker, or any hard and blunt object you can comfortably nestle up to. \"You cant trust a soul in this world\", she would ironically dictate. This lopsided fear was mostly actuated by a parallel experience to the former - she woke up one winter night to find a burglar looming over her in that very same bed.  \n\nShe screamed, and yet, her clamorous alert didn't deter him from twisting his lips into a sickening grin, the ordeal capped by a sly wink of the eye. He exited hastily before she could call police. What's even more bizarre is the fact that the intruder hadn't swiped a thing. All of her possessions remained in their rightful places.  Perhaps the experience might not have beem so irreparably traumatizing had she not been alone.  Her roommates had already left for Christmas break, and mom wasn't planning on departing for another two days.  Upon later inspection she would be left scratching her head and arching her brows - no windows were left opened, and she clearly recalled locking the door from the inside before going to bed.  Augury?  Omen?  Or just coincidence?  A paranormal soiree had preceded this years before.\n\nWhen she was a little girl, often during summer nights, a form would appear at the far end of the property, watching intently from the tree line.  The latent figure, which she would describe as \"partially transparent\", was one of a little girl wearing a pale, downy dress, \"like she was ruffled with dove's feathers\".  Not one of her siblings had ever witnessed anything, ultimately dismissing the claimant's visions as a wistful misinterpretation or an outright lie.  She saw the girl often, but always at a distance.  Her grandfather, at the time ailing from frequent bouts of pneumonia, and essentially house-ridden, would accede to her that neither ghosts nor souls exist.  \n\nMy mother persisted obstinately with her claims, now alleging that this august, semi-transparent child, meditative and fit for placid staring contests, had, every few nights, been inching closer and closer to the house.  It was winter now, and these purported visions drastically increased in frequency. The cold was brooding, winds gnashed against the groaning walls, the eaves drooled with frozen spears, and the outsides of the windows deluged with half an inch of carmelized ice, presenting good cause for the argument of illusion. On more than one occasion, having pained herself to willingly suspend any and all belief that this \"apparition\" was no more than a corporeal child of the neighborhood, my mother had swiped her sister's shawl from the rack and trampled out into the fallen snow to throw it around the shoulders of the diaphanous and hardly formidable little destitute, which, in a space of seconds, always had vanished.  \n\nSoon my mother would cease her fanciful musings altogether and retreat to her room, burying herself in books and toiling over her oil canvas paintings of ravens, reposed inside the faint naturally lit gloom of pale blue evenings and grey, laminar skies, quietly seething with a tangibly disquieting sentiment proffered her in dreams through the conduit of a small, softly balanced voice: \"I'll be there soon\".\n\nApotheosis of this insular tension swept in fiercely one ordinary night. Grandpa was a jovial soul, but in all of his living years, if he could will himself to believe less in anything in the world than he could Santa Claus, it was ghosts.  His conviction of the matter might even be considered dogged, since grandma had died in that very house less than a year prior to this night, and if there was anything he'd have loved to have believed in more than anything, it would be to see or speak to her again.  His inveterate derision regarding the very idea of the incorporeal was rooted in this enduring, lifelong subsistence of the beloved and the vanished.  As he lay supine, sunken into the polyester sinkhole of HIS recliner, drifting between a doze and a peek, the living room saturated in dull perennial blue despite the various dancing colors projected from the idiot box, something off into the darkness of the dining room, the entryway stretched eight feet off to his righthand periphery, stirred him from his indolence.\n\n\"Cassie, get back to bed!  Don't you know I catch *everything???*.  I know you're stealing cookies, and if I catch ya a-laughin' I'm gonna give ya a-wrappin'!\".  He shut his eyes but was again roused by a sudden attack of sense - the sixth.  Not a smell nor touch nor taste nor sight, but something he'd ever struggle to intepret.  He shook himself lucid and turned toward the darkness, briefly cadging an impression before *Cassie* sauntered beyond the eclipse of the wall, deeper into the kitchen.  Propping himself on his cane and groaning against the ache suffused throughout his limbs, he lumbered toward the dining room, stopped a moment to peek inside, that gut-deep rousing percolating, the darkness becoming a lurid interloper.\n\nTo the immediate right the adiaphane shapes of the room stood harsh and erect, shaped only by a dim skein of faraway floodlights over a neighboring yard, but one thing stood out clearly - the girl in white.  The table in the kitchen, separate from and smaller than the dining room table, rested in the middle of the room, and was oval-shaped.  Grandpa squinted and flitted his eyes until they filled with water, dabbing it off with a hanky and drawing his glasses from his breast pocket.  \"Who is that?  Cassie?  What could possibly have gotten into your head that you might tease and play little games at this hour!  And with grandpap Earl!  You uinterpret. the trouble youre in???\"  But the girl stood her ground opposite his side of the table, her eyes dark, as if projected inward, arms at her sides, brunette drapery framing her face, which hed begun to notice as all too unfamiliar.  As grandpa limped his way around the table she moved herself likewise, and they began playing a little game of chase which resumed only a minute or two.\n\nGrandpa stopped, and, as mom recalls, when he was about to lose his wits and burst into a hollering fit, there was this morsel of a moment where his veins ran through and through with ice.  It was her nose.  My mother and her siblings, had they one distinction to match all else, it was their dimpled little specks of noses.  The nose on this girl resembled a beak on any number of moms paintings.  Blighted with latent chest pains, in a state of disbelief to rival his hitherto unbelief, the girl suddenly started again, clamped lips growing full to a grin, rounding the table in a swift gale as if trying to catch hold of him.  The temperature in the room had ushered frost to the inside of the panes.  The chase recommenced, only now she the hunter and grandpa the hunted.  \n\nScared out of his wits, he lumbered around the table one revolution after another as the ghost moved faster, running without stepping, producing no audible sound.  The distance closing between them, grandpa made haste for the living room and the stairs, falling once on his face, juddering the foundation of the whole house, and cried out at the top of his lungs.  Mom and Cassie had been roused by it, and within seconds grandpa burst through the door only to find all of his grandchildren in their beds.  Mom said that the most terrifying thing she'd ever seen was a the visage of man so incapable of being terrified looking so terrified.  His head was lustrous with sweat, skin pale as the pollarded cedars outside, breathing intensely labored, irresolute and resolute at once.  \n\nMom cried out.  The others bestirred and the little ones tearing querulously at the image of an unbreakable, broken protector.  Doubled with his hands on his knees, he removed his hat he slept in and wore day to night every day for three decades and heaved and heaved.  Mom already knew, but lest she be reprimanded, she kept her mouth shut, Cassie looking at her for the very comment she would conceal.  \"Just wanted to make sure you all were okay\".  \"What's the matter, pa?\", said Cassie.  \"Nothing, nothing.  Go back to sleep\".  \n\nIt's here that mother ceases her yarn and directs us to summer, when the house was put up for sale, and, mom being nineteen, all eventually had moved in with her.  Grandpap moved in with our aunt Gerty.  Admonition would fall upon anyone who questioned him about that night thereafter, but aunt Gerty would secretly spin that story to me when I would ask her about it.  Evidently he illustrated the event to her in fine detail.  Aunt Gerty believed every word of it, even if she believed nothing else that had ever come out of his mouth.  Most of the time he'd \"go white with terror\" and halt the story midway.\n\nGrandpa died before I was born, but my mother has insisted that of a lifetime of little gained idiosyncrasies, there was another that had only presented itself around the end of his life - an immutable tick - all throughout every day, be it dawn or dusk, had you stopped to look at him for even a minute, you'd scarcely ever catch him *not* looking over both shoulders'.\n\nThank you, Erica.",

I called an adult. And I will regret that choice for the rest of  my life.\n\nLast week there was a  bit of a stir in my town, a 10 year old boy hadn't made it home from  drama practice despite living a quarter mile away from the school he was  at practice in. No trace of him was found. At least, until I noticed  the kid under the street light in front of my house.\n\nThe  face was practically imprinted on my mind, and it wasn't hard to bring  up a news article featuring a picture of the kid. And yup! That's him.  You know, aside from the clotted blood dribbling down his chin and the  distended stomach.\n\nSo I called 911. \"911, this call is being recorded. Please state the nature of your emergency.\"\n\n\"Uh, yeah hi... A child went missing last week in my town, and I think I found him.\"\n\n\"Oh! That's great! Is he safe now? Did you take him in?\"\n\n\"Uh, no. No I did not. He's uh. I don't know that he's well.\"\n\n\"What do you mean! It's freezing outside! You left him in the cold!?\"\n\n\"Yeah,  I sure did. He had clotted blood running down the front of him. And he  wasn't shivering despite the cold. Just staring up at my house. At the  window I was looking at him from actually.\"\n\n\"What's  the address? I'll have a unit sent over right away.\" At this point the  operator is using a tone filled with disdain and disgust, but she didn't  know.\n\n\"Uh, maybe you should send more than one... That kid scares the shit out of me.\" And then I rattled off my address.\n\nThe operator must not have passed along that last bit of my request. And I really wish she had.\n\nWithin  ten minutes a police car ROARS down my street, sirens blazing. And sure  enough, the kid's still standing there, lit by the police car's  headlights. And he's still staring at me.\n\nThe  cop steps out of his car with a blanket, and starts walking over to the  kid. I couldn't hear what was being said because my windows were  closed. But as the cop drew nearer, the kid turned his head and looked  at the police officer.\n\nThen the car's lights turned off. All of them and the siren. Pop! Off they go.\n\nAnd  within seconds, the screaming started. And then there were several  gunshots. And then another scream that will haunt me until the day I  die. Started off with a man screaming in agony, and then suddenly became  something you might hear out of a pig being slaughtered.\n\nAnd then there was silence.\n\nI called 911 again. \"911, this call is being recorded.\" blah blah blah.\n\n\"Yeah,  hi. Uh, I uh... I called a few minutes ago about a kid out front of my  house... The police car just got here... I think you need to send more. I  heard screaming and gunshots... but I don't hear anything anymore.\"\n\nHearing the words gunshots and screaming were the magic words apparently.\n\nToday  I learned my small town has an actual SWAT van, complete with a SWAT  team. It and several other police cars roared down my street, also with  lights on and sirens blaring despite it being close to midnight now.\n\nThey found the police car still sitting there and running, apparently. Just all the lights were fried.\n\nAnd they found blood, and bullet casings, and... something else.\n\nThe entire epidermis of a 10 year old boy, clothes and all. Just the skin. Nothing else.\n\nOne of the SWAT members actually puked when he found the leavings.\n\nThe officers found some tracks leading into the woods, adult male sized shoes.\n\nSome  officers approached my house, but I wasn't going to open my door for  love or money. Abso-fucking-lutely not. They then mentioned having a  battering ram and a missing officer, so open the fucking door RIGHT NOW.\n\nThey  raised an excellent argument. I opened the door. Then promptly fixed  the salt line over the threshold they broke when they stepped in.  Apparently terror can make people a little irrational. Who knew. I  recounted my experience the night before, the footprints, the missing  chickens, seeing the kid, making the call. They took intent notes and  seemed less inclined to think I was crazy. Based on what they'd found.\n\nWhile  I was talking to the officers, they apparently rolled the K9 officer  out of bed, and she showed up with her Shepherd, who was trained to do  some tracking work.\n\nThe Shepherd  however was having none of it, thank you very much. He got a whiff of  the missing officer from his vehicle, and then tracked him out of his  car, got a whiff of where the skin was left and promptly put his tail  down and VERY much wanted to go home where it was safe.\n\nRooted  to the spot as a matter of fact, having ZERO inclination to move  towards the woods. I couldn't blame him. My pup wasn't interested in  leaving the house at all, and wasn't even barking a hello at the new dog  out front of his turf.\n\nAfter  seeing the dog's reaction as well as their own unsettled feelings, the  cops decided to clean up what they could right then and then search in  the morning. I was told to call if I saw the officer, but do not  approach, just call. I had to refrain from rolling my eyes. Calling  worked real well the first time, eh?\n\nI think I might try doing something I haven't done in 15 years tomorrow once the sun's up.\n\nMight  be a good time to visit church, and make a confession. The police don't  seem to have a fucking clue what's going on. Maybe the church can help  me. Do you folks have any ideas? I'm very much open to even the most  ridiculous sorts.",

        "text": "I.\n\nThe Woods\n\nIt was Caleb who told us about the church in the woods. Caleb knew every urban legend in town.\n\nMe and his twin sister, Beck, would go along with him in search of proof and a glimpse of the supernatural.\n\nThere was the lizard man, the murder house on Ash Street, the abandoned sanatorium, where a cult performed black magic and human sacrifices, and of course the Bunny Bridge, which was said to be a portal into hell.\n\nThey were all easily debunked.\n\nThe lizard man was arrested for illegally owning and selling exotic wild animals.\n\nThe Ash murder house was the scene of a familicide but it no longer exists, as it was demolished a few years ago and transformed into a memorial garden.\n\nThe sanatorium, while incredibly creepy, housed no cult, just a group of acid-dropping goths who were happy to share their drugs with us.\n\nAnd the Bunny Bridge was not a portal to hell but the home of territorial wasps who had taken the bridge as their own.\n\nAnd then there was the Church in the woods and the cemetery surrounding it.\n\nThe legend in town said a powerful witch lived there, surrounded by the graves of her children. They said if she caught you trespassing, she would steal your soul and keep you for eternity as her child.\n\nIt was interesting, sure, especially as try as we might, we could never find the church. There was a ritual you had to perform, and of course, none of us knew what that entailed.\n\nWe figured it was just the adultâs way of scaring us into staying out of the woods.\n\nWhen Caleb talked about the other legends, it was with harmless fascination. The church was different.\n\nHe spoke about it in hushed reverence.\n\nHe wanted to be the first to find it, and he vowed he would.\n\nâIâm going to find it,â he said one night as we ate pizza and watched movies.\n\nâSure,â Beck said, her mouth full of sauce and cheese. âYou do that, Caleb.â\n\nâI am,â he said, uncharacteristically serious.\n\nâIâm going to find it, guys, I will, and then Iâll show you.â\n\nBeck and I shared a look, and she shrugged.\n\nâOkay,â she said. âWe believe you.â\n\nâ§\n\nI saw little of Caleb for the rest of the year, and I forgot all about the church.\n\nThe school year had started, and as a senior, I was so busy that I had no time to think of urban legends.\n\nInstead, I focused on my AP classes, college applications, counseling meetings, applying for scholarships, midterms, finals, and prom.\n\nAs busy as we were, me and Beck made time for one another. We had been dating for five years, and I was a regular fixture at her house, as mine was hectic because of my four younger brothers.\n\nThat was the night that changed everything.\n\nIt was a typical Friday night with Beck and me eating pizza and watching some crappy horror films.\n\nI asked her how Caleb was doing, as his absence was pronounced tonight. He would usually join us.\n\nâIs he okay?â I asked. âI havenât seen him around lately.â\n\nâYou wouldnât,â Beck said. âHeâs basically on house arrest. Dad found out heâs failing three classes and might not graduate. Heâs allowed to go to school and the bathroom, and thatâs it.â\n\nShe said this casually, but I knew she was worried.\n\nâWhatâs going on with him, Beck?â I asked.\n\nBut she wouldnât look at me, and I changed the subject.\n\nâ§\n\nWe were fully engrossed in the movie when Caleb burst into Beckâs room. His eyes were wide and manic, and with his wild hair and untamed beard, I barely recognized him.\n\nâLourdes! Beck! You guys, I did it! I did it; I finally found it!â\n\nâStop it, Caleb,â Beck said sharply. âGet out, or Iâll call dad.â\n\nCaleb ignores his sister and sets his attention on me. He was trembling in his excitement. âI found it, Lourdes. I found the church!â\n\nI was confused at first, and then realization dawned on me.\n\nâYou found it?â I say in genuine amazement. âHow?â\n\nCaleb goes into a long-winded explanation that I donât even attempt to follow.\n\nâThe trees! I figured out that you have to trust the trees. And then the crows follow them, but not the bats; the bats are liars. And the grave! The babyâs grave. Itâs there; itâs all there!â\n\nHe babbles nonsensically and paces back and forth.\n\nHe looks crazy; I think. He looks possessed.\n\nWas this what he had been doing this entire year? Talking to trees and following crows?\n\nHis obsession has pushed him over the edge.\n\nâWill you come, you guys? Please, you said you would come.â\n\nâNo,â Beck says.\n\nâSure,â I say.\n\nWe look at one another.\n\nI have to admit that I am curious. Nobody has ever found the church, and this would probably be the end of our search for urban legends because, in a few months, we would head off to college.\n\nBeck looks tired. She gnaws on her bottom lip.\n\nI squeeze her hand gently.\n\nCome on,â I whisper. âWe said we would, after all.â\n\nShe rolls her eyes and runs a hand through her choppy hair.\n\nâFine,â she snaps. âFine. If we do this, and he sees thereâs nothing there but his delusions, maybe heâll finally wake the fuck up.â\n\nI smile at her, and she smiles back, but itâs strained, and I see fear flickering in her eyes.\n\nâ§\n\nBeck drives, and Caleb talks nonstop the entire ride to the woods.\n\nHe tells us about the twisted trees and the talking animals he encountered.\n\nHe speaks about the faces of the dog and the cemetery with its sunken headstones.\n\nI looked at his reflection in the rearview window. His eyes are wild, and thereâs sweat on his upper lip. His hands gesticulate wildly as he talks.\n\nBefore we left, Beck pulled me aside as Caleb went to his room to bring the supplies. Whatever those were.\n\nâAre you sure you want to do this? Heâs been freaking me out, Lourdes. Itâs beyond obsession now.â\n\nâLetâs do it,â I urged. âWe both know that we wonât be doing this anymore after we graduate. I know youâre curious because I am.â\n\nBeck said nothing. She was still biting her lip.\n\nâI am,â she admitted. âBut Iâm also scared. What if this is a trap?â She said, âLike the real Caleb is gone, and this Caleb is leading us there to feed us to the witch.â\n\nâBeck,â I laughed. âThat is the plot of the shitty movie we just watched.â\n\nâI know, but Lourdes, heâs been so weird this entire year. I mean, weirder than usual.â She fell silent again, clearly weighing the options in her head.\n\nâOkay, fine, alright, letâs go, but donât die and have your ghost come crying to me because I told you so.â\n\nAfter seeing Caleb like this, though, Beckâs uncertainty about the situation makes sense.\n\nAs if reading my thoughts, Caleb stops mid-sentence and meets my gaze.\n\nHe smiles at me and bares his teeth. A trickle of dark blood runs down one nostril, and his eyes roll back into his head, exposing wet empty sockets.\n\nI gasp, but when I blink, the blood is gone, and Caleb is looking at me curiously. His eyes are tired, but completely normal.\n\nI smile nervously and turn back to face the road.\n\nâAre you okay?â Beck asks, glancing at me.\n\nâYeah, yeah, Iâm fine, just excited.â\n\nIt had just been a trick of the light; I assured myself. Nothing else.\n\nBut for the rest of the ride, I feel him looking at me, and I know he is smiling.\n\nâ§\n\nThe woods arenât woods so much as it is a grove.\n\nItâs relatively big, and the paths are confusing; if you arenât familiar with the area, youâll get lost.\n\nExploring the woods is a rite of passage for the kids in town. We grew up splashing in the dirty creek and digging in the ground, looking for gold. All we ever unearthed were fat earthworms and clusters of pill bugs.\n\nAt night, we would run through it under a blanket of black sky and silver stars. We played tag, climbed trees, and waded in that gross water.\n\nI live close to the woods. You could technically call it my backyard.\n\nBeck parks on the curb by my house. Itâs completely dark outside.\n\nGood, I think. Everyone is sleeping or out for the night.\n\n Iâm not sure which it is, so just in case, I gesture to Beck and Caleb to be quiet, and we tiptoe to the backyard.\n\nThere was no point, though, because the gate screeched as I opened it, but the lights blessedly remained off, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nWe approached the woods, me and Beck hesitating while Caleb walked ahead.\n\nI hold Beckâs hand and she smiles at me.\n\nWe followed Caleb into the darkness.\n\nWe had a witch to find.\n\nMaybe it was because my imagination was already beginning to run wild, but I could swear that as we entered the woods, it significantly grew darker.\n\nThe treeâs branches swayed in the wind, sprinkling us with droplets of rain, and the ground was thick with mud.\n\nWe said nothing while we followed Caleb, but I could tell that Beck was annoyed. Her body was tense with frustration, and her lips were thin as she chewed on the words she was dying to spit out.\n\nIt was nearly midnight, and the sky was pitch black. There were no stars, just the moon, dim and yellow.\n\nHonestly, I was disappointed. With us learning that the church and witch were real I thought that the woods would change into a landscape of phantasmagorical horrors, complete with thick fog and disembodied whispers warning us to leave.\n\nIt was creepy, but it was the same woods I have walked in hundreds of times before. The only difference was the volumes of sound that had increased tenfold--the babble of water, the chirp of bugs, and the low hoot of an owl.\n\nThis was the soundtrack of the night\n\nCaleb was quiet now, a dramatic from how talkative he had been the entire ride here.\n\nHis lips were pinched and white in a determined grimace, and his eyes were serious.\n\nWe had been walking for around ten minutes when he stopped suddenly.\n\nI nearly stumbled into him, and Beck glared at his backside as though, with her gaze, she could set him on fire.\n\nWe were at a junction that divided itself into many paths. The left led to the highway; the right led to the creek, and the center most one took you to the farmhouse, an abandoned, dilapidated relic that the county pretended didnât exist.\n\nCaleb was muttering to himself. He took out a pouch, opened it, and poured its contents onto the ground.\n\nI saw bits of wheat, corn, raisins, and sunflowers. It was birdseed.\n\nWhat the hell is he doing? I thought. Beck opened her mouth, but Caleb held up his hand.\n\nâPlease,â he said, still spreading the birdseed. âI canât have anyone interrupt me.â\n\nThis was the Caleb I knew. Intelligent and methodical.\n\nThe pouch was now empty, and Caleb was still talking to himself. I couldnât make out a word. And then he said loudly and clearly,\n\nâBless us all to the ends of our days. Bless us so we may live to see tomorrow.\n\nHe stood still for a moment. It had become very quiet; even the wind had stopped. I could only hear Calebâs heavy breathing. It looked as though he were steeling himself for something.\n\nHe nodded and then pulled something out of his bag. And it took me a moment to realize that it was a knife.\n\nBefore I could say anything or even react, Caleb held his hand out and slashed at his palm.\n\nI gasped, Beck shrieked, and Caleb was silent except for his blood dripping onto the ground.\n\nBeck was pissed, and she rushed toward him.\n\nShe stopped in her tracks as Caleb looked at her. His eyes were wild and angry.\n\nShe gawked at him but didnât say a word.\n\nBeck was the oldest by nine minutes and was the stereotypical tough, bossy sister, while Caleb was her opposite; he was shy and sweet. I had never seen him like this before, and Beck obviously hadnât either.\n\nDark blood streamed down Calebâs wrist; and dripped off his fingertips like rain.\n\nI felt sick but watched transfixed as each droplet of blood stained and seeped into the bird seed.\n\nWe heard them before we saw them.\n\nIt was a low buzzing, like an annoying fly invading your personal space but times that by one hundred. The buzzing crescendoed into deep guttural croaking and then a rustling, the sound of many things flapping.\n\nBeck and I looked at one another and then up at the sky.\n\nEven in the darkness, we could see it, a dark cloud coming closer and closer.\n\nThere is no fucking way, I thought. What the fuck?\n\nThey were crows, dozens and dozens of crows flying towards us, their maniacal cawing so loud that I temporarily went deaf.\n\nThere were so many of them they blocked out the faraway moon. We were plunged into absolute darkness, and now deaf and blind, I could only feel their presence. Their feathers struck my face.\n\nA group of crows is called a murder, I thought wildly.\n\nMurdermurdermurdermurdermur\n\nAnd then my senses returned to me. The moon reappeared, and I watched as they flew towards Caleb and descended onto the birdseed hungrily.\n\nIt was silent except for the clicking of beaks.\n\nâWhat in the absolute fuck?â Beck muttered. âCaleb, what the fuck is going on?â\n\nCaleb turned his gaze away from the crows he had been watching with interest.\n\nThey ate the birdseed until it was gone and then in complete synchronization, took flight towards the path on the left.\n\nCaleb looked at us with a slight grin on his face.\n\nâI told you we must follow the crows,â he said.\n\nâDramatic much?â Beck said under her breath.\n\nCaleb ignored her. His eyes tracking the crows. âLetâs -â he says, and then he stops. He looks scared.\n\nMy stomach drops as I follow his gaze and then my heart pounds in my chest so hard it hurts.\n\nTwo shadowy figures have emerged from the thicket of trees ahead of us, and I can feel the hate and the evil emanating from them.\n\nThey stagger toward us, hands outstretched, reaching with long, thin fingers. And I know that this is the witch and her minion, ready to gouge out our eyes and eat our souls.\n\nI scream. Beck screams. Caleb screams.\n\nAnd then, shockingly, Calebâs shriek cuts off and turns into laughter.\n\nâOh, you guys came! You made it!â He says gleefully.\n\nI blink, and the shadows come into focus, the moonlight unveiling them.\n\nA boy and a girl around our age stare back at us. The girlâs full lips are twisted into a sly smile.\n\nWhat is she doing here? I think.\n\nâOh god, not you.â Beck says, her voice dripping with disdain.âWhat are you doing here?â\n\nThe girl in front of us is still smiling. Her pretty brown face is haughty, and her hair is long and woven into tiny braids.\n\nShe pushes a braid out of her face with one long, lacquered nail.\n\nâI could ask the same of you, Rebecka.â She says snidely. âWhy are you here?â\n\nâCaleb is my brother, dumbass. I donât have to answer you.â\n\nâAnd Caleb is my boyfriend, Rebecka. I donât have to answer you either.â\n\nBeck turns to Caleb, enraged.\n\nâYou told me you guys broke up!â She says and Caleb has the grace to look ashamed. He looks down at the ground, his cheeks burning.\n\nâWell, we did, but then Madeline -â\n\nMadeline saunters over to Caleb and wraps her arms around his waist. She glares at Beck.\n\nâWhy do you think we must tell you everything about our relationship? Whatâs it to you?â\n\nThe two bicker, their voices rising. Caleb attempts to calm them down, but they ignore him as if he isnât there.\n\nâWho are you?â I say to the boy, who looks like he would love nothing more than to disappear back into the trees.\n\nHe looks like a pale version of Madeline with bright red hair.\n\nâEzra, um, Iâm Ezra,â he clears his throat. âMadelineâs brother.â\n\nâHalf-brother,â Madeline corrects, pausing her fight with Beck. She stares daggers at Ezra.\n\nEzra rolls his eyes. âRight, her half-brother. Madeline needed a ride here and didnât want to go in alone. She failed her driving test again and-â\n\nâShut up, Ezra!â Madeline screeches.\n\nHe smirks, and I do too. âRight, sorry. She did not fail her test for the 3rd time; she just needed a chaperone.â\n\nMadeline looks murderous.\n\nI laugh. I like Ezra already.\n\nCaleb and Madeline have been dating on and off since 7th grade. Mostly off because of Madeline.\n\nBeck hates Madeline for the constant manipulation of her twin, and Madeline loves confrontation.\n\nâWhy were you guys hiding behind the tree?â I ask. âWhy were you trying to scare us?â\n\nEzra has the decency to look ashamed, but Madeline bursts into peals of laughter.\n\nâWe got you, didnât we? Whew, the look on your faces was so funny!â\n\nâNo, it wasnât funny, Madeline, you stupid cow,â Beck snaps. âYouâre lucky if I donât dropkick you.â\n\nThis starts a fresh round of fighting between them, and my head is starting to hurt.\n\nâUh, guys,â I say. Can we keep moving? I want to go to sleep before dawn.â\n\nThey stop, and Beck says sorry. She sheepishly comes to my side while Madeline hugs Calebâs waist.\n\nâLead the way,â Beck says somewhat resignedly. âWeâre all here, so time to meet this witch.â\n\nCaleb smiles and gestures toward the trees where the crows have perched.\n\nThey fly towards them, and the trees part. Some bend and others uproot themselves. Their branches arch and their trunks twist to reveal a hidden path.\n\nA path that shimmers in a kaleidoscope of patterns made up of colors I have no name for.\n\nI donât think there is a word to describe how I feel at this moment, but if I had to settle on one, it would be enchanted. It deepens with every step I take. What is this place that ceremony, blood, and crows have revealed?\n\nIâm tripping. Much harder than the time I took acid in that rotting asylum.\n\nI like it, though.\n\nI can see the air moving, and the wind calls my name.\n\nThe trees are whispering to one another, and the crows have once again perched themselves on their waving branches, silent and staring\n\nThey see everything.\n\nThis is it, I think giddily. This is where I want to die.\n\nI do not know where that thought comes from, and I donât care.\n\nThere is a rumbling underneath me that makes my entire body shake, and without looking, I know the crooked trees have straightened and returned to their respective roots.\n\nI know that the path behind us has closed.\n\nâ§\n\nThe bats are following me, and theyâre telling me horrible things.\n\nâSomebody died in the creek, you know--a young boy,â one whispers.\n\nâHis body was swollen and blue when they fished him out,â another bat sneers. âAnd when they placed him on the dirt, his stomach burst and was full of maggots.â\n\nâDonât you want to know what the farmerâs wife thought as he bashed her head open?â The third bat giggles. âOh, the things you think while you die. Youâd be surprised, oh, you would be surprised.â\n\nThey wonât stop, and I can still hear them. They wonât stop.\n\nThe bats are liars, Caleb had said. Okay, but a boy had drowned in the creek. We had been friends, and I remember seeing the police officers trudge into the woods and come out holding a large black bag, looking pale.\n\nAnd the farmer in that farmhouse had murdered his wife and then shot himself with his shotgun after.\n\nNot lies, truths.\n\nI wonder if anybody else is experiencing what I am. I look around me, and Beck is pale, Madelineâs eyes are wide and afraid, and Ezraâs cheeks are wet with tears, and when - he looks at me, I see his eyes are red.\n\nOnly Caleb looks unperturbed.\n\nMaybe Beck was right, I think. Perhaps he has made a deal with the witch, and we are his sacrifices.\n\nâShe wonât take your eyes,â the bat says, so close to my ear that its fur tickles me. âSheâll rip out your heart and make you eat it, and then sheâll bury you alive.â\n\nâStop,â I mutter and shoo it away. âGo away, you little shit.â\n\nI try to focus on where I am and where we are going. Beckâs hand is warm and soft in my own, and that grounds me.\n\nItâs quiet, and the crows unfurl in the sky like streaming ribbons. Occasionally, they shed a feather, and it drifts down\n                                        down\n                                            down\n\nI catch one and marvel at its beauty. It shimmers in my hand, embedded with dark jewels.\n\nI turn it over to inspect it further, and when I do, the jewels shift and crawl over my wrist. They trail down my arm and creep up my neck; they burrow themselves into my hair.\n\nI drop the feather and pat myself as if I were on fire. I itch all over.\n\nThey fall off me like raindrops and scurry away on the ground. Not jewels, I think, feeling sick. Bugs.\n\n\nBeck looks disgusted and over it. She says nothing, but I know she wants to.\n\nThe deeper we walk into the woods, the trippier it gets.\n\nThe sky is red; thereâs no moon or sun; everything is just red.\n\nThe flat ground has transformed into crumbling cobblestone, and I know I shouldnât be amazed after everything Iâve experienced so far, but oh, I am.\n\nMy body vibrates with every step, and it is thrumming with energy. It feels good; it feels really, really good.\n\nThe air has changed; it smells sweet but unpleasant. It reminds me of the smell of rotting fruit.\n\nThe trees are breathing. Slow inhales, and loud exhales that make their branches quiver.\n\nEverything around me is shimmering, and I am blinded by sensations and colors\n\nMy vision distorts, and what I see is terrifying. Beckâs eyes are large black pools, and her mouth is wide and screaming.\n\nMadelineâs mouth is stretched from ear to ear like a smug Cheshire Cat.\n\nEzraâs red hair is on fire, and when I look at him, I see his eyes burst and run down his face like yolk.\n\nCaleb turns to look at me, and he is bloated and blue. When he opens his mouth to speak, wriggling maggots dribble out.\n\nHis mouth keeps moving, but I canât hear him. All I hear is a high-keening whistle.\n\nIt gets higher and higher, louder and louder and I feel something hot and wet drip out of my ears. I touch it and my fingers come away smeared with dark red blood.\n\nMy blood clumps together and then break apart.\n\nIt transforms into ruby red jewels that then turn into bugs.\n\nThey climb up my arm and chew through my neck. They dig into the whorls of my brain.\n\nMy skull is burning, and I hear screams.\n\nBloodcurdling screams make the leaves on the trees curl and fall to the ground, smoking.\n\nThe screams go on and on, and more blood leaks from my ears. It sprays from my nose like a geyser and trickles from my eyes.\n\nI canât see, hear or breathe and I am drowning in my blood.\n\nAnd then everything goes black, the screaming stops and the world is silent.\n\nI open my eyes, and I am on the ground. The sky is black, and the moon is yellow.\n\nBeck and Ezraâs terrified faces loom over me. Beckâs skin is milk-white, and she has been crying.\n\nâAre you okay?â She asks after they help me up.\n\nâIâm fine,â I reply, but my voice shakes, and my hands are trembling and smeared with dried blood.\n\nâWhat is happening? What happened?â\n\nBeck doesnât answer; instead, she whirls on Caleb, standing to the side with a scared-looking Madeline. His face is blank, and Beckâs face contorts in rage.\n\nâWe are done.â She spits. âI donât give a shit about any of this anymore, Caleb! Lourdes is bleeding from her fucking ears and eyes and nearly didnât wake up, and youâre just standing there! You cut yourself like some goddamn sacrifice. Iâm done. We. Are. Done.â She repeats. âFuck you, and fuck this fucking place and this so-called witch. You can stay, but we are out.â\n\nShe doesnât wait for a response. She grabs my wrist and practically drags me down the path from whence we came.\n\nâThe pathâs closed,â Caleb calls behind us. âYou canât get out that way. Iâm the only one who knows the way. I know what to do to get in and get out.â\n\nBeckâs shrieks are incomprehensible.\n\nâThen fucking tell me how to get the fuck out, Caleb, you fucking asshole!â\n\nâBesides,â Caleb says, ignoring her. âWeâre already here.â\n\nâWhat?â\n\nBeck and I look at one another and then turn around.\n\nI gasp, and Beck mutters:\n\nâWhat the fuck?â\n\nIt is there. Weâre here.\n\nâ§\n\nThere are faces in the fog of all ages and genders. The only similarity is their eyes. Theyâre closed as though they are sleeping, but I know theyâre not.\n\nThe church looms in the distance on a hill.\n\nItâs made of crumbling, white brick weathered by time and lack of care.\n\nIts door is painted a dull, dirty grey and on top of its small structure is a steeple. It houses a church bell that sways gently in the breeze.\n\nSurrounding the church are dozens of old headstones; they jut from the ground like crooked teeth. The fog rests there like a blanket shielding the cemetery, protecting it.\n\nProtecting it from us? I wonder. Or us from it.\n\nBeck and I rejoin the group, and we are all silent in our wonder.\n\nâI canât believe itâs real; itâs fucking real,â I hear Beck muttering.\n\nI look at Caleb, and I am shocked to see that he is kneeling on the ground, crying.\n\nâHello,â he sobs. âIâm here again.â\n\nYeah, this is really fucking weird.\n\nI understand, though.\n\nThe church and its cemetery are hauntingly beautiful. The scenery reminds me of a fairy tale, a macabre fairy tale, sure, but a fairy tale nevertheless.\n\nItâs day here.\n\nThe sky is cloudless and light blue, and the sun beams down on the church seraphically. \n\nThis is the lair of the witch?\n\nBesides the fog and the twisted headstones, it didnât look like I thought it would, and glancing at the othersâ faces, and I know they are thinking the same.\n\nCaleb has finally stopped crying, and now swiping at his wet cheeks, he stands up.\n\nHe turns to the rest of us, his smile wide and charming. Iâve missed that smile, and a sudden wave of sadness washes over me. He hasnât smiled like that in so long.\n\nâWeâre here, you guys! Weâre finally here! Didnât I tell you? Isnât this amazing?â\n\nNobody knows what to say. I mean, what is there to say?\n\nWe are here, and it is pretty amazing. We have finally found truth in an urban legend. Well, partial truth. We have yet to see the witch.\n\nBeck, who has also been gazing at the church in stunned awe, shakes herself out of it as though she has just remembered how mad she had been at Caleb ten minutes ago.\n\nShe scowls.\n\nâGreat, yeah, incredible. Itâs amazing. So when are we going? How do we get out?â\n\nCalebâs brow furrows as if he doesnât understand what sheâs saying.\n\nâGet out?â He repeats, puzzled.\n\nâYeah, Caleb, get out. This has been fun and everything, but itâs getting late or early,â Beck glances at the sun. âCan we go?â\n\nâBut we just got here, Rebecka! We havenât even seen the witch!â\n\nâDo you not see how creepy this is? How weird it all feels?â\n\nâIt feels just fine! God, I am so tired of you bossing me around. We only do what you want to do!â\n\nCaleb is wrong, though. Beck is right. It doesnât feel good here. Itâs beautiful, but everything is wrong. My skin is prickling with goosebumps.\n\nEzra and Madeline look as uncomfortable as I feel. Madeline stares at the church as quietly as a mouse, her mouth ajar.\n\nâHow do we leave?â Beck asks again. âYou said you know how.â\n\nâI do,â Caleb says.\n\nâThen do it.â\n\nâNo.â\n\nâThen tell us!â\n\nâNo!â\n\nBeck grabs Calebâs bag, snarling, and Caleb slaps her hands away. She bites him, and he yelps and then they begin to slap-fight one another.\n\nBeck grabs the bag again and snatches it from Caleb gleefully. She sticks her tongue out at him and opens it, and then pulls out a notebook, frowning.\n\nShe flips through its pages and then throws it at him.\n\nâItâs fucking empty, you asshole!â\n\nâI know!â Caleb shoots back, rubbing his bruised arm. He taps his head. âItâs all up here, I told you. â\n\nâTell. Me.â Beck says through gritted teeth.\n\nâNo. Come on, we have to find the witch, and you guys will see!â\n\nCaleb turns on his heels and walks toward the church, but heâs not looking at where heâs going.\n\nHe doesnât notice the small grave marker peeking out of the dirt. If he had, he surely would have stepped over it. And if he had tripped and the bigger headstone behind it wasnât there, he would have just landed face-first in the dirt.\n\nBut none of that happened, and that grave was there, and as much as we wish to change the past, itâs already been written.\n\nWhen Caleb trips over the grave marker, I see the look of surprise on his face as he falls. He looks ridiculous at that moment; itâs like he wants to say oh shit, this is going to hurt.\n\n\nI shut my eyes, but itâs too late. It wouldnât have done me good, anyway. The sound of Calebâs neck breaking will haunt me forever.\n\nThe quiet that follows is the longest I have ever experienced. I never knew silence could be so loud.\n\nAnd then the air is ripped apart by Beckâs raw, guttural screams.\n\nShe runs towards Caleb, and we follow her mutely.\n\nEzra helps as we turn him over carefully while Madeline dances around us, squealing in a small voice: âDonât move him! Donât move him! Oh, youâre not supposed to move him!â\n\nWhen we do, and Madeline sees him, she takes one look and turns around to vomit.\n\nI take a quick intake of breath.\n\nCalebâs head is bent to one side, and his eyes are open and blood-red. Theyâre moving, and they flit from me to Ezra to Beck. They fixate on Beck when he sees her. His lips quiver as though heâs trying to smile.\n\nBeck is patting his hand and crying while telling him heâs good, heâs fine. Weâre going to get help for you, okay? Youâre fine, youâre fine, youâll be okay. I love you. I love you. Donât leave me like Mom. I love you. Please. Please.\n\nAnd then Calebâs eyes stop moving, they remain fixated on the crystal blue sky. His hand goes limp in Beckâs hand, and she grabs onto him even tighter. Her screams are animalistic and primal, and she refuses to let go of him.\n\nI donât know what to do, and I canât breathe.\n\nI feel robbed of my senses, my joy.\n\nHow is it fair that, in a second, life changes everything so drastically?\n\nHe was just here. He was just talking and just fighting with Beck. Itâs a dream. Wake up, Lourdes. Wake up.\n\nBut I am awake. It is Caleb who now sleeps.\n\nI am so full and heavy with grief that, temporarily; I forget where we are.\n\nItâs the church bell that reminds me. The wind has picked up; itâs strong and makes the bell clang wildly. It slams against the steeple walls so hard that I wonder if it will crack.\n\nThe sky is darkening with a convergence of clouds. They overtake the light of the sun.\n\nThe wind is fury, and it blows my hair into my face. But in the wind, I hear a disembodied voice. Itâs Calebâs, and his words make my blood run cold.\n\nâIâm the only one who knows how to get out of here,â Caleb had said. âItâs all up here.â\n\nOh. No.\n\nOh, fucking hell.",

        "text": "I.\n\nThe Woods\n\nIt was Caleb who told us about the church in the woods. Caleb knew every urban legend in town.\n\nMe and his twin sister, Beck, would go along with him in search of proof and a glimpse of the supernatural.\n\nThere was the lizard man, the murder house on Ash Street, the abandoned sanatorium, where a cult performed black magic and human sacrifices, and of course the Bunny Bridge, which was said to be a portal into hell.\n\nThey were all easily debunked.\n\nThe lizard man was arrested for illegally owning and selling exotic wild animals.\n\nThe Ash murder house was the scene of a familicide but it no longer exists, as it was demolished a few years ago and transformed into a memorial garden.\n\nThe sanatorium, while incredibly creepy, housed no cult, just a group of acid-dropping goths who were happy to share their drugs with us.\n\nAnd the Bunny Bridge was not a portal to hell but the home of territorial wasps who had taken the bridge as their own.\n\nAnd then there was the Church in the woods and the cemetery surrounding it.\n\nThe legend in town said a powerful witch lived there, surrounded by the graves of her children. They said if she caught you trespassing, she would steal your soul and keep you for eternity as her child.\n\nIt was interesting, sure, especially as try as we might, we could never find the church. There was a ritual you had to perform, and of course, none of us knew what that entailed.\n\nWe figured it was just the adultâs way of scaring us into staying out of the woods.\n\nWhen Caleb talked about the other legends, it was with harmless fascination. The church was different.\n\nHe spoke about it in hushed reverence.\n\nHe wanted to be the first to find it, and he vowed he would.\n\nâIâm going to find it,â he said one night as we ate pizza and watched movies.\n\nâSure,â Beck said, her mouth full of sauce and cheese. âYou do that, Caleb.â\n\nâI am,â he said, uncharacteristically serious.\n\nâIâm going to find it, guys, I will, and then Iâll show you.â\n\nBeck and I shared a look, and she shrugged.\n\nâOkay,â she said. âWe believe you.â\n\nâ§\n\nI saw little of Caleb for the rest of the year, and I forgot all about the church.\n\nThe school year had started, and as a senior, I was so busy that I had no time to think of urban legends.\n\nInstead, I focused on my AP classes, college applications, counseling meetings, applying for scholarships, midterms, finals, and prom.\n\nAs busy as we were, me and Beck made time for one another. We had been dating for five years, and I was a regular fixture at her house, as mine was hectic because of my four younger brothers.\n\nThat was the night that changed everything.\n\nIt was a typical Friday night with Beck and me eating pizza and watching some crappy horror films.\n\nI asked her how Caleb was doing, as his absence was pronounced tonight. He would usually join us.\n\nâIs he okay?â I asked. âI havenât seen him around lately.â\n\nâYou wouldnât,â Beck said. âHeâs basically on house arrest. Dad found out heâs failing three classes and might not graduate. Heâs allowed to go to school and the bathroom, and thatâs it.â\n\nShe said this casually, but I knew she was worried.\n\nâWhatâs going on with him, Beck?â I asked.\n\nBut she wouldnât look at me, and I changed the subject.\n\nâ§\n\nWe were fully engrossed in the movie when Caleb burst into Beckâs room. His eyes were wide and manic, and with his wild hair and untamed beard, I barely recognized him.\n\nâLourdes! Beck! You guys, I did it! I did it; I finally found it!â\n\nâStop it, Caleb,â Beck said sharply. âGet out, or Iâll call dad.â\n\nCaleb ignores his sister and sets his attention on me. He was trembling in his excitement. âI found it, Lourdes. I found the church!â\n\nI was confused at first, and then realization dawned on me.\n\nâYou found it?â I say in genuine amazement. âHow?â\n\nCaleb goes into a long-winded explanation that I donât even attempt to follow.\n\nâThe trees! I figured out that you have to trust the trees. And then the crows follow them, but not the bats; the bats are liars. And the grave! The babyâs grave. Itâs there; itâs all there!â\n\nHe babbles nonsensically and paces back and forth.\n\nHe looks crazy; I think. He looks possessed.\n\nWas this what he had been doing this entire year? Talking to trees and following crows?\n\nHis obsession has pushed him over the edge.\n\nâWill you come, you guys? Please, you said you would come.â\n\nâNo,â Beck says.\n\nâSure,â I say.\n\nWe look at one another.\n\nI have to admit that I am curious. Nobody has ever found the church, and this would probably be the end of our search for urban legends because, in a few months, we would head off to college.\n\nBeck looks tired. She gnaws on her bottom lip.\n\nI squeeze her hand gently.\n\nCome on,â I whisper. âWe said we would, after all.â\n\nShe rolls her eyes and runs a hand through her choppy hair.\n\nâFine,â she snaps. âFine. If we do this, and he sees thereâs nothing there but his delusions, maybe heâll finally wake the fuck up.â\n\nI smile at her, and she smiles back, but itâs strained, and I see fear flickering in her eyes.\n\nâ§\n\nBeck drives, and Caleb talks nonstop the entire ride to the woods.\n\nHe tells us about the twisted trees and the talking animals he encountered.\n\nHe speaks about the faces of the dog and the cemetery with its sunken headstones.\n\nI looked at his reflection in the rearview window. His eyes are wild, and thereâs sweat on his upper lip. His hands gesticulate wildly as he talks.\n\nBefore we left, Beck pulled me aside as Caleb went to his room to bring the supplies. Whatever those were.\n\nâAre you sure you want to do this? Heâs been freaking me out, Lourdes. Itâs beyond obsession now.â\n\nâLetâs do it,â I urged. âWe both know that we wonât be doing this anymore after we graduate. I know youâre curious because I am.â\n\nBeck said nothing. She was still biting her lip.\n\nâI am,â she admitted. âBut Iâm also scared. What if this is a trap?â She said, âLike the real Caleb is gone, and this Caleb is leading us there to feed us to the witch.â\n\nâBeck,â I laughed. âThat is the plot of the shitty movie we just watched.â\n\nâI know, but Lourdes, heâs been so weird this entire year. I mean, weirder than usual.â She fell silent again, clearly weighing the options in her head.\n\nâOkay, fine, alright, letâs go, but donât die and have your ghost come crying to me because I told you so.â\n\nAfter seeing Caleb like this, though, Beckâs uncertainty about the situation makes sense.\n\nAs if reading my thoughts, Caleb stops mid-sentence and meets my gaze.\n\nHe smiles at me and bares his teeth. A trickle of dark blood runs down one nostril, and his eyes roll back into his head, exposing wet empty sockets.\n\nI gasp, but when I blink, the blood is gone, and Caleb is looking at me curiously. His eyes are tired, but completely normal.\n\nI smile nervously and turn back to face the road.\n\nâAre you okay?â Beck asks, glancing at me.\n\nâYeah, yeah, Iâm fine, just excited.â\n\nIt had just been a trick of the light; I assured myself. Nothing else.\n\nBut for the rest of the ride, I feel him looking at me, and I know he is smiling.\n\nâ§\n\nThe woods arenât woods so much as it is a grove.\n\nItâs relatively big, and the paths are confusing; if you arenât familiar with the area, youâll get lost.\n\nExploring the woods is a rite of passage for the kids in town. We grew up splashing in the dirty creek and digging in the ground, looking for gold. All we ever unearthed were fat earthworms and clusters of pill bugs.\n\nAt night, we would run through it under a blanket of black sky and silver stars. We played tag, climbed trees, and waded in that gross water.\n\nI live close to the woods. You could technically call it my backyard.\n\nBeck parks on the curb by my house. Itâs completely dark outside.\n\nGood, I think. Everyone is sleeping or out for the night.\n\n Iâm not sure which it is, so just in case, I gesture to Beck and Caleb to be quiet, and we tiptoe to the backyard.\n\nThere was no point, though, because the gate screeched as I opened it, but the lights blessedly remained off, and I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nWe approached the woods, me and Beck hesitating while Caleb walked ahead.\n\nI hold Beckâs hand and she smiles at me.\n\nWe followed Caleb into the darkness.\n\nWe had a witch to find.\n\nMaybe it was because my imagination was already beginning to run wild, but I could swear that as we entered the woods, it significantly grew darker.\n\nThe treeâs branches swayed in the wind, sprinkling us with droplets of rain, and the ground was thick with mud.\n\nWe said nothing while we followed Caleb, but I could tell that Beck was annoyed. Her body was tense with frustration, and her lips were thin as she chewed on the words she was dying to spit out.\n\nIt was nearly midnight, and the sky was pitch black. There were no stars, just the moon, dim and yellow.\n\nHonestly, I was disappointed. With us learning that the church and witch were real I thought that the woods would change into a landscape of phantasmagorical horrors, complete with thick fog and disembodied whispers warning us to leave.\n\nIt was creepy, but it was the same woods I have walked in hundreds of times before. The only difference was the volumes of sound that had increased tenfold--the babble of water, the chirp of bugs, and the low hoot of an owl.\n\nThis was the soundtrack of the night\n\nCaleb was quiet now, a dramatic from how talkative he had been the entire ride here.\n\nHis lips were pinched and white in a determined grimace, and his eyes were serious.\n\nWe had been walking for around ten minutes when he stopped suddenly.\n\nI nearly stumbled into him, and Beck glared at his backside as though, with her gaze, she could set him on fire.\n\nWe were at a junction that divided itself into many paths. The left led to the highway; the right led to the creek, and the center most one took you to the farmhouse, an abandoned, dilapidated relic that the county pretended didnât exist.\n\nCaleb was muttering to himself. He took out a pouch, opened it, and poured its contents onto the ground.\n\nI saw bits of wheat, corn, raisins, and sunflowers. It was birdseed.\n\nWhat the hell is he doing? I thought. Beck opened her mouth, but Caleb held up his hand.\n\nâPlease,â he said, still spreading the birdseed. âI canât have anyone interrupt me.â\n\nThis was the Caleb I knew. Intelligent and methodical.\n\nThe pouch was now empty, and Caleb was still talking to himself. I couldnât make out a word. And then he said loudly and clearly,\n\nâBless us all to the ends of our days. Bless us so we may live to see tomorrow.\n\nHe stood still for a moment. It had become very quiet; even the wind had stopped. I could only hear Calebâs heavy breathing. It looked as though he were steeling himself for something.\n\nHe nodded and then pulled something out of his bag. And it took me a moment to realize that it was a knife.\n\nBefore I could say anything or even react, Caleb held his hand out and slashed at his palm.\n\nI gasped, Beck shrieked, and Caleb was silent except for his blood dripping onto the ground.\n\nBeck was pissed, and she rushed toward him.\n\nShe stopped in her tracks as Caleb looked at her. His eyes were wild and angry.\n\nShe gawked at him but didnât say a word.\n\nBeck was the oldest by nine minutes and was the stereotypical tough, bossy sister, while Caleb was her opposite; he was shy and sweet. I had never seen him like this before, and Beck obviously hadnât either.\n\nDark blood streamed down Calebâs wrist; and dripped off his fingertips like rain.\n\nI felt sick but watched transfixed as each droplet of blood stained and seeped into the bird seed.\n\nWe heard them before we saw them.\n\nIt was a low buzzing, like an annoying fly invading your personal space but times that by one hundred. The buzzing crescendoed into deep guttural croaking and then a rustling, the sound of many things flapping.\n\nBeck and I looked at one another and then up at the sky.\n\nEven in the darkness, we could see it, a dark cloud coming closer and closer.\n\nThere is no fucking way, I thought. What the fuck?\n\nThey were crows, dozens and dozens of crows flying towards us, their maniacal cawing so loud that I temporarily went deaf.\n\nThere were so many of them they blocked out the faraway moon. We were plunged into absolute darkness, and now deaf and blind, I could only feel their presence. Their feathers struck my face.\n\nA group of crows is called a murder, I thought wildly.\n\nMurdermurdermurdermurdermur\n\nAnd then my senses returned to me. The moon reappeared, and I watched as they flew towards Caleb and descended onto the birdseed hungrily.\n\nIt was silent except for the clicking of beaks.\n\nâWhat in the absolute fuck?â Beck muttered. âCaleb, what the fuck is going on?â\n\nCaleb turned his gaze away from the crows he had been watching with interest.\n\nThey ate the birdseed until it was gone and then in complete synchronization, took flight towards the path on the left.\n\nCaleb looked at us with a slight grin on his face.\n\nâI told you we must follow the crows,â he said.\n\nâDramatic much?â Beck said under her breath.\n\nCaleb ignored her. His eyes tracking the crows. âLetâs -â he says, and then he stops. He looks scared.\n\nMy stomach drops as I follow his gaze and then my heart pounds in my chest so hard it hurts.\n\nTwo shadowy figures have emerged from the thicket of trees ahead of us, and I can feel the hate and the evil emanating from them.\n\nThey stagger toward us, hands outstretched, reaching with long, thin fingers. And I know that this is the witch and her minion, ready to gouge out our eyes and eat our souls.\n\nI scream. Beck screams. Caleb screams.\n\nAnd then, shockingly, Calebâs shriek cuts off and turns into laughter.\n\nâOh, you guys came! You made it!â He says gleefully.\n\nI blink, and the shadows come into focus, the moonlight unveiling them.\n\nA boy and a girl around our age stare back at us. The girlâs full lips are twisted into a sly smile.\n\nWhat is she doing here? I think.\n\nâOh god, not you.â Beck says, her voice dripping with disdain.âWhat are you doing here?â\n\nThe girl in front of us is still smiling. Her pretty brown face is haughty, and her hair is long and woven into tiny braids.\n\nShe pushes a braid out of her face with one long, lacquered nail.\n\nâI could ask the same of you, Rebecka.â She says snidely. âWhy are you here?â\n\nâCaleb is my brother, dumbass. I donât have to answer you.â\n\nâAnd Caleb is my boyfriend, Rebecka. I donât have to answer you either.â\n\nBeck turns to Caleb, enraged.\n\nâYou told me you guys broke up!â She says and Caleb has the grace to look ashamed. He looks down at the ground, his cheeks burning.\n\nâWell, we did, but then Madeline -â\n\nMadeline saunters over to Caleb and wraps her arms around his waist. She glares at Beck.\n\nâWhy do you think we must tell you everything about our relationship? Whatâs it to you?â\n\nThe two bicker, their voices rising. Caleb attempts to calm them down, but they ignore him as if he isnât there.\n\nâWho are you?â I say to the boy, who looks like he would love nothing more than to disappear back into the trees.\n\nHe looks like a pale version of Madeline with bright red hair.\n\nâEzra, um, Iâm Ezra,â he clears his throat. âMadelineâs brother.â\n\nâHalf-brother,â Madeline corrects, pausing her fight with Beck. She stares daggers at Ezra.\n\nEzra rolls his eyes. âRight, her half-brother. Madeline needed a ride here and didnât want to go in alone. She failed her driving test again and-â\n\nâShut up, Ezra!â Madeline screeches.\n\nHe smirks, and I do too. âRight, sorry. She did not fail her test for the 3rd time; she just needed a chaperone.â\n\nMadeline looks murderous.\n\nI laugh. I like Ezra already.\n\nCaleb and Madeline have been dating on and off since 7th grade. Mostly off because of Madeline.\n\nBeck hates Madeline for the constant manipulation of her twin, and Madeline loves confrontation.\n\nâWhy were you guys hiding behind the tree?â I ask. âWhy were you trying to scare us?â\n\nEzra has the decency to look ashamed, but Madeline bursts into peals of laughter.\n\nâWe got you, didnât we? Whew, the look on your faces was so funny!â\n\nâNo, it wasnât funny, Madeline, you stupid cow,â Beck snaps. âYouâre lucky if I donât dropkick you.â\n\nThis starts a fresh round of fighting between them, and my head is starting to hurt.\n\nâUh, guys,â I say. Can we keep moving? I want to go to sleep before dawn.â\n\nThey stop, and Beck says sorry. She sheepishly comes to my side while Madeline hugs Calebâs waist.\n\nâLead the way,â Beck says somewhat resignedly. âWeâre all here, so time to meet this witch.â\n\nCaleb smiles and gestures toward the trees where the crows have perched.\n\nThey fly towards them, and the trees part. Some bend and others uproot themselves. Their branches arch and their trunks twist to reveal a hidden path.\n\nA path that shimmers in a kaleidoscope of patterns made up of colors I have no name for.\n\nI donât think there is a word to describe how I feel at this moment, but if I had to settle on one, it would be enchanted. It deepens with every step I take. What is this place that ceremony, blood, and crows have revealed?\n\nIâm tripping. Much harder than the time I took acid in that rotting asylum.\n\nI like it, though.\n\nI can see the air moving, and the wind calls my name.\n\nThe trees are whispering to one another, and the crows have once again perched themselves on their waving branches, silent and staring\n\nThey see everything.\n\nThis is it, I think giddily. This is where I want to die.\n\nI do not know where that thought comes from, and I donât care.\n\nThere is a rumbling underneath me that makes my entire body shake, and without looking, I know the crooked trees have straightened and returned to their respective roots.\n\nI know that the path behind us has closed.\n\nâ§\n\nThe bats are following me, and theyâre telling me horrible things.\n\nâSomebody died in the creek, you know--a young boy,â one whispers.\n\nâHis body was swollen and blue when they fished him out,â another bat sneers. âAnd when they placed him on the dirt, his stomach burst and was full of maggots.â\n\nâDonât you want to know what the farmerâs wife thought as he bashed her head open?â The third bat giggles. âOh, the things you think while you die. Youâd be surprised, oh, you would be surprised.â\n\nThey wonât stop, and I can still hear them. They wonât stop.\n\nThe bats are liars, Caleb had said. Okay, but a boy had drowned in the creek. We had been friends, and I remember seeing the police officers trudge into the woods and come out holding a large black bag, looking pale.\n\nAnd the farmer in that farmhouse had murdered his wife and then shot himself with his shotgun after.\n\nNot lies, truths.\n\nI wonder if anybody else is experiencing what I am. I look around me, and Beck is pale, Madelineâs eyes are wide and afraid, and Ezraâs cheeks are wet with tears, and when - he looks at me, I see his eyes are red.\n\nOnly Caleb looks unperturbed.\n\nMaybe Beck was right, I think. Perhaps he has made a deal with the witch, and we are his sacrifices.\n\nâShe wonât take your eyes,â the bat says, so close to my ear that its fur tickles me. âSheâll rip out your heart and make you eat it, and then sheâll bury you alive.â\n\nâStop,â I mutter and shoo it away. âGo away, you little shit.â\n\nI try to focus on where I am and where we are going. Beckâs hand is warm and soft in my own, and that grounds me.\n\nItâs quiet, and the crows unfurl in the sky like streaming ribbons. Occasionally, they shed a feather, and it drifts down\n                                        down\n                                            down\n\nI catch one and marvel at its beauty. It shimmers in my hand, embedded with dark jewels.\n\nI turn it over to inspect it further, and when I do, the jewels shift and crawl over my wrist. They trail down my arm and creep up my neck; they burrow themselves into my hair.\n\nI drop the feather and pat myself as if I were on fire. I itch all over.\n\nThey fall off me like raindrops and scurry away on the ground. Not jewels, I think, feeling sick. Bugs.\n\n\nBeck looks disgusted and over it. She says nothing, but I know she wants to.\n\nThe deeper we walk into the woods, the trippier it gets.\n\nThe sky is red; thereâs no moon or sun; everything is just red.\n\nThe flat ground has transformed into crumbling cobblestone, and I know I shouldnât be amazed after everything Iâve experienced so far, but oh, I am.\n\nMy body vibrates with every step, and it is thrumming with energy. It feels good; it feels really, really good.\n\nThe air has changed; it smells sweet but unpleasant. It reminds me of the smell of rotting fruit.\n\nThe trees are breathing. Slow inhales, and loud exhales that make their branches quiver.\n\nEverything around me is shimmering, and I am blinded by sensations and colors\n\nMy vision distorts, and what I see is terrifying. Beckâs eyes are large black pools, and her mouth is wide and screaming.\n\nMadelineâs mouth is stretched from ear to ear like a smug Cheshire Cat.\n\nEzraâs red hair is on fire, and when I look at him, I see his eyes burst and run down his face like yolk.\n\nCaleb turns to look at me, and he is bloated and blue. When he opens his mouth to speak, wriggling maggots dribble out.\n\nHis mouth keeps moving, but I canât hear him. All I hear is a high-keening whistle.\n\nIt gets higher and higher, louder and louder and I feel something hot and wet drip out of my ears. I touch it and my fingers come away smeared with dark red blood.\n\nMy blood clumps together and then break apart.\n\nIt transforms into ruby red jewels that then turn into bugs.\n\nThey climb up my arm and chew through my neck. They dig into the whorls of my brain.\n\nMy skull is burning, and I hear screams.\n\nBloodcurdling screams make the leaves on the trees curl and fall to the ground, smoking.\n\nThe screams go on and on, and more blood leaks from my ears. It sprays from my nose like a geyser and trickles from my eyes.\n\nI canât see, hear or breathe and I am drowning in my blood.\n\nAnd then everything goes black, the screaming stops and the world is silent.\n\nI open my eyes, and I am on the ground. The sky is black, and the moon is yellow.\n\nBeck and Ezraâs terrified faces loom over me. Beckâs skin is milk-white, and she has been crying.\n\nâAre you okay?â She asks after they help me up.\n\nâIâm fine,â I reply, but my voice shakes, and my hands are trembling and smeared with dried blood.\n\nâWhat is happening? What happened?â\n\nBeck doesnât answer; instead, she whirls on Caleb, standing to the side with a scared-looking Madeline. His face is blank, and Beckâs face contorts in rage.\n\nâWe are done.â She spits. âI donât give a shit about any of this anymore, Caleb! Lourdes is bleeding from her fucking ears and eyes and nearly didnât wake up, and youâre just standing there! You cut yourself like some goddamn sacrifice. Iâm done. We. Are. Done.â She repeats. âFuck you, and fuck this fucking place and this so-called witch. You can stay, but we are out.â\n\nShe doesnât wait for a response. She grabs my wrist and practically drags me down the path from whence we came.\n\nâThe pathâs closed,â Caleb calls behind us. âYou canât get out that way. Iâm the only one who knows the way. I know what to do to get in and get out.â\n\nBeckâs shrieks are incomprehensible.\n\nâThen fucking tell me how to get the fuck out, Caleb, you fucking asshole!â\n\nâBesides,â Caleb says, ignoring her. âWeâre already here.â\n\nâWhat?â\n\nBeck and I look at one another and then turn around.\n\nI gasp, and Beck mutters:\n\nâWhat the fuck?â\n\nIt is there. Weâre here.\n\nâ§\n\nThere are faces in the fog of all ages and genders. The only similarity is their eyes. Theyâre closed as though they are sleeping, but I know theyâre not.\n\nThe church looms in the distance on a hill.\n\nItâs made of crumbling, white brick weathered by time and lack of care.\n\nIts door is painted a dull, dirty grey and on top of its small structure is a steeple. It houses a church bell that sways gently in the breeze.\n\nSurrounding the church are dozens of old headstones; they jut from the ground like crooked teeth. The fog rests there like a blanket shielding the cemetery, protecting it.\n\nProtecting it from us? I wonder. Or us from it.\n\nBeck and I rejoin the group, and we are all silent in our wonder.\n\nâI canât believe itâs real; itâs fucking real,â I hear Beck muttering.\n\nI look at Caleb, and I am shocked to see that he is kneeling on the ground, crying.\n\nâHello,â he sobs. âIâm here again.â\n\nYeah, this is really fucking weird.\n\nI understand, though.\n\nThe church and its cemetery are hauntingly beautiful. The scenery reminds me of a fairy tale, a macabre fairy tale, sure, but a fairy tale nevertheless.\n\nItâs day here.\n\nThe sky is cloudless and light blue, and the sun beams down on the church seraphically. \n\nThis is the lair of the witch?\n\nBesides the fog and the twisted headstones, it didnât look like I thought it would, and glancing at the othersâ faces, and I know they are thinking the same.\n\nCaleb has finally stopped crying, and now swiping at his wet cheeks, he stands up.\n\nHe turns to the rest of us, his smile wide and charming. Iâve missed that smile, and a sudden wave of sadness washes over me. He hasnât smiled like that in so long.\n\nâWeâre here, you guys! Weâre finally here! Didnât I tell you? Isnât this amazing?â\n\nNobody knows what to say. I mean, what is there to say?\n\nWe are here, and it is pretty amazing. We have finally found truth in an urban legend. Well, partial truth. We have yet to see the witch.\n\nBeck, who has also been gazing at the church in stunned awe, shakes herself out of it as though she has just remembered how mad she had been at Caleb ten minutes ago.\n\nShe scowls.\n\nâGreat, yeah, incredible. Itâs amazing. So when are we going? How do we get out?â\n\nCalebâs brow furrows as if he doesnât understand what sheâs saying.\n\nâGet out?â He repeats, puzzled.\n\nâYeah, Caleb, get out. This has been fun and everything, but itâs getting late or early,â Beck glances at the sun. âCan we go?â\n\nâBut we just got here, Rebecka! We havenât even seen the witch!â\n\nâDo you not see how creepy this is? How weird it all feels?â\n\nâIt feels just fine! God, I am so tired of you bossing me around. We only do what you want to do!â\n\nCaleb is wrong, though. Beck is right. It doesnât feel good here. Itâs beautiful, but everything is wrong. My skin is prickling with goosebumps.\n\nEzra and Madeline look as uncomfortable as I feel. Madeline stares at the church as quietly as a mouse, her mouth ajar.\n\nâHow do we leave?â Beck asks again. âYou said you know how.â\n\nâI do,â Caleb says.\n\nâThen do it.â\n\nâNo.â\n\nâThen tell us!â\n\nâNo!â\n\nBeck grabs Calebâs bag, snarling, and Caleb slaps her hands away. She bites him, and he yelps and then they begin to slap-fight one another.\n\nBeck grabs the bag again and snatches it from Caleb gleefully. She sticks her tongue out at him and opens it, and then pulls out a notebook, frowning.\n\nShe flips through its pages and then throws it at him.\n\nâItâs fucking empty, you asshole!â\n\nâI know!â Caleb shoots back, rubbing his bruised arm. He taps his head. âItâs all up here, I told you. â\n\nâTell. Me.â Beck says through gritted teeth.\n\nâNo. Come on, we have to find the witch, and you guys will see!â\n\nCaleb turns on his heels and walks toward the church, but heâs not looking at where heâs going.\n\nHe doesnât notice the small grave marker peeking out of the dirt. If he had, he surely would have stepped over it. And if he had tripped and the bigger headstone behind it wasnât there, he would have just landed face-first in the dirt.\n\nBut none of that happened, and that grave was there, and as much as we wish to change the past, itâs already been written.\n\nWhen Caleb trips over the grave marker, I see the look of surprise on his face as he falls. He looks ridiculous at that moment; itâs like he wants to say oh shit, this is going to hurt.\n\n\nI shut my eyes, but itâs too late. It wouldnât have done me good, anyway. The sound of Calebâs neck breaking will haunt me forever.\n\nThe quiet that follows is the longest I have ever experienced. I never knew silence could be so loud.\n\nAnd then the air is ripped apart by Beckâs raw, guttural screams.\n\nShe runs towards Caleb, and we follow her mutely.\n\nEzra helps as we turn him over carefully while Madeline dances around us, squealing in a small voice: âDonât move him! Donât move him! Oh, youâre not supposed to move him!â\n\nWhen we do, and Madeline sees him, she takes one look and turns around to vomit.\n\nI take a quick intake of breath.\n\nCalebâs head is bent to one side, and his eyes are open and blood-red. Theyâre moving, and they flit from me to Ezra to Beck. They fixate on Beck when he sees her. His lips quiver as though heâs trying to smile.\n\nBeck is patting his hand and crying while telling him heâs good, heâs fine. Weâre going to get help for you, okay? Youâre fine, youâre fine, youâll be okay. I love you. I love you. Donât leave me like Mom. I love you. Please. Please.\n\nAnd then Calebâs eyes stop moving, they remain fixated on the crystal blue sky. His hand goes limp in Beckâs hand, and she grabs onto him even tighter. Her screams are animalistic and primal, and she refuses to let go of him.\n\nI donât know what to do, and I canât breathe.\n\nI feel robbed of my senses, my joy.\n\nHow is it fair that, in a second, life changes everything so drastically?\n\nHe was just here. He was just talking and just fighting with Beck. Itâs a dream. Wake up, Lourdes. Wake up.\n\nBut I am awake. It is Caleb who now sleeps.\n\nI am so full and heavy with grief that, temporarily; I forget where we are.\n\nItâs the church bell that reminds me. The wind has picked up; itâs strong and makes the bell clang wildly. It slams against the steeple walls so hard that I wonder if it will crack.\n\nThe sky is darkening with a convergence of clouds. They overtake the light of the sun.\n\nThe wind is fury, and it blows my hair into my face. But in the wind, I hear a disembodied voice. Itâs Calebâs, and his words make my blood run cold.\n\nâIâm the only one who knows how to get out of here,â Caleb had said. âItâs all up here.â\n\nOh. No.\n\nOh, fucking hell.",

        "text": "By Tayler Montgomery\n\nThis is my first creepypasta story! Written and edited in 6 days, the full story is over 46000 characters long; 6000 too many for Reddit. I will link each chapter. Please Enjoy!\n\n**Chapter 1:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10n19rm/i\\_time\\_traveled\\_to\\_one\\_second\\_in\\_the\\_past\\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10n19rm/i_time_traveled_to_one_second_in_the_past_i/)\n\n**Chapter 2: Atomic Epiphany**\n\nSleeping inside my passable body was worse than sleeping buried under dead bodies. My contorted face was everywhere around and inside my head, as I watched millions of eyes staring at me. Older hair from the back of my head stretched and fused with newer parts of my stretched sleeping face. I was surrounded by wretched, demonic faces; strangers whose countenances whispered death into my restless soul, inviting me to their traumatic abyss of hysteria. And then I noticed something that I somehow didnât in the twelve hours of being alien: every sound I made echoed with a one-second delay before silence intercepted them. Is this cloud around me nothing more than duplicates of my atoms one second in the past? Even though my entire trail shows my every action chronologically, every atom composing it must be one second old before being frozen in time. I fell asleep, dreaming of the moment my cutters made contact with the thin black ring, reflecting on how I thought it was harmless, residual carbon. Stars burn hydrogen into helium before carbon litters the stellar cores, fusing into diamonds before going supernova, but my theory â Dr. Manryâs theory â was wrong after all. What was that ring? \n\nIn the blackness, my vision was consumed by a void. Particles perfectly arranged themselves into vibrating objects. Atoms formed, rapidly accelerating their assembly into dust particles. The space filled the void before I saw large black spheres begin to glow blue, then yellow as massive fireballs of red contours propagated from them. Small shadows of planets could be seen through the barely illuminated clouds. More stars revealed the arm of a red galaxy until it was fully formed into combinations of white, brown, and blue gas. Two smaller clouds, violet and blue, decorated with stars, materialized, perfectly motionless. I saw the universe first being formed, not from a bang, but from an impossibility. Growth continued to accelerate until a cosmic web of galaxies formed out of an advancing spherical boundary. It kept going. I thought it was going to stop, or the edge of the universe would have fully formed, but instead, the universe continued to materialize faster and faster as a white ball of noise. It brightened with an intensity that woke me up to the early morning sun on my face. \n\nâImpossible,â I thought, âthat the universe can create itself; particles replicating themselves into stars and galaxies like trillions of falling jigsaw puzzle pieces landing themselves into portraits. A scientific epiphany slapped me in the face. I was not witnessing the formation of the universe, but its destruction in reverse. Why is it expanding though? I realized that if we are in reverse, experiencing inverted time while the universe has always been eternally undestroying itself, then the universe has no beginning, no boundaries, and one end that we perceive as a beginning to an infinite expansion. That means the Law of the conservation of mass can be violated as long as that which eternally existed can form out of absolute nothing by reversing its destruction. My early morning rumination was interrupted by the sound of a welding torch. \n\nâYup. It doesnât work,â one technician said, âthe anomaly is frozen in time. Heat canât transfer to it.â \n\nThe other said, \n\nâWeâll have to barricade this hatch and cut out a new one. Thereâs no other way in.â \n\nI saw Gertie walking from the lounge up to my bed, holding two mugs and a coffee pot. She spoke to me like any sarcastic sister is to a brother, except she was twice my age, \n\nâHave a cup of courage. Mustâve been a hard night.â \n\nâThanks, Gertie. I think I need a straw. I canât touch the mug.â \n\nâJust hold out your hands flat,â she motioned, setting the mug down on the cold surface of the statue's hands and inserting a straw. \n\nBiting down on a simple straw was a dumb mistake, as it got trapped between hundreds of teeth. She pulled it out, then said, \n\nâHold very still. You should be able to drink it.â \n\nI did, as this was the first thing I could consume in almost 24 hours. \n\nâThank you, Gertieâ¦for everything. Did you ever go home last night?â \n\nâNope. We didnât even sleep. We held a press conference from 2 am to about an hour ago, at around 7 am,â she said, as her tireless complexion aged her more than ten years overnight. \n\nShe continued, \n\nâI have the day off, but the supervisor let me stay here anyway.â\n\nâStay, like, for me? Donât you have a family to go home to?â \n\nShe said sarcastically, \n\nâBelieve me, bub, that you know a twice-divorced old lady with grandkids almost as old as you ainât got nothing better to do in life than feed an ugly green alien at work.â \n\nI chuckled. Gertrude was far from senile for her age and personified a southern pentecostal red neck as tough as Ozarkian nails. \n\nâWhatever you say, Gertie. And get some sleep before someone embalms you. One hour isnât good,â I backfired as if I had slept any better than an hour. \n\nAs Gertie took the mugs, Dr. Manry met with the technicians on the scene as they began erecting scaffolding and guardrails around the reactor. \n\nâHey, Nate,â Manry told one of the seven guys snapping together the steel rods, âin the warehouse, there should be a palette of plastic wrap tubes in the far back corner. You can forklift it and drop it over there,â he said, pointing to an area near the main garage. He explained,\n\nâWe donât want radioactive contaminants leaking out.â \n\nI lay in my bed, still buried under my body parts with the faint light of the rising sun penetrating them. \n\nâWhat contaminants?â I thought, remembering the Geiger counter I left in the chamber giving no reading for radiation. What were they planning to do? I surmised that they would likely turn on the reactor again today. No. Thatâs insane. Especially in trying to save my life by creating a doomsday black hole. I felt a burning sensation in my stomach, realizing the coffee I drank had begun to freeze. \n\nI heard the forklift behind me, the engineâs roar reverberating within the assembly building before dropping off a palette, driving away, then returning with another. About an hour later, I sat up, seeing the utter transformation the staff had made to the area surrounding the reactor. Each worker carried crossbars up to the top floors of the scaffolding that circum the front of the reactor chassis, while eight-foot tall frames with steel pipe headers were set up like dominoes around the scaffolding before branching the row in two, one leading out of the building and another next to a floor drain. I suppose the drain was going to be for power washing suits. Huge plastic tarps were rolled under the frames, then clipped onto their headers to form a makeshift tunnel. The plastic tarps were clipped onto taller frames, then to the highest bars of the scaffolding, which supported the plastic roof. In only two hours, the staff had made a laboratory tent, finishing the last of the bars around my bed, having used some bags and scotch tape to weigh the plastic to the floor. Several floor blowers slightly inflated the tent, providing ventilation. \n\nFrom the moment of my transformation, I knew it was going to take months for them to fix me, and the field experiments hadnât even begun yet. I slept again, comforted by the block of iced coffee as my only daily sustenance. I was then woken up by the sound of a screeching mechanical sound. Through the dark cloud, I could make out a concrete saw; its blade steaming with hot water, partially embedded in the stretched remains of my body. \n\nI heard a field engineer say, \n\nâWeâre making good headway. Problem is, we need to get under the hull, upside down, cut right across there to wedge this thing out.â \n\nI caught sight of several cuts with hammered steel wedges embedded into the green plastic trunk. After an hour of nonstop cutting, they changed out the blade, jackhammered in larger wedges, went under the reactor chassis where I last exited the hatch, and cut diagonal cross lines. The sound of ice cracking and the engineer happily relieved saying âtimber!â lightened the mood of the operation. The forklift freed a chunk, hoisted by chains and straps, to the outside of the building. They weld torched a door cut-out of the reactorâs hull, hoisting up the concrete saw, cutting off the remaining chunks of supernatural ice, and recovering the equipment Simon and I left. \n\nOne of the engineers said, alarmed, \n\nâThe samples are warming up. Oh crap. Theyâre leaking blood! Get 'emâ out of here! Now!â \n\nThe chunks of my now thawing flesh were thrown into black trash bags, then tied up and carried  outside. I saw blood profusely pour out of both the hatch and the cut-out door. I witnessed both a murder scene and a slain creature. The blade screeched a loud, âSHREE,â then powered down quietly enough to hear the men in the chamber screaming in terror. The green body that had been severed from the hatch began to thaw out, fall to the floor, and crack. Then I realized something that overwhelmed me with hope; my face stopped stretching, then my hands and torso. I was disconnecting from the ring, soon to be free. I heard a gushing liquid sound and I saw blood pouring everywhere on the floor. Men hastily jumped out of the chamber door, forgetting the ladder, each landing on the floor one by one. Other men came to pry out the wedges to block the red flow shooting out. Then came my most dreaded fear. I was slowly becoming immobile. My body began fusing to the flesh; my hands became trapped inside thousands of bones and muscles. \n\nâHelp! Stop, please!â I screamed in terror. \n\nI immediately pulled myself away, falling hard on my back on the concrete floor. \n\nâIâm stuck!â I screamed. \n\nI saw my legs below the chins buried in the thawing meat and icing white plastic suit. After one second, my hands and legs were completely fused to the frozen fleshy corpses. Paramedics rushed to help me. Circulation in my legs bled out in the meaty husk. My rapidly closing ears heard panicking voices surrounding me as I felt scissors cut off my suit and clothes. \n\nâCPR. Now! Heâs bleeding internally. Wrap the tourniquets around his thighs. Get the saw. Take the legs.â \n\nBefore I knew it, I was dying quickly. Anesthesia was administered in both my thighs, and I felt an intensely uncomfortable scraping vibration in my right knee and femur. Then I felt it on my left before everything went dark.",

I will link each chapter. Please Enjoy! \n\n**Chapter 1: Transfer Initiation Protocol**\n\nI saw fit that I should write my testimony after the events that unfolded, at least, such chronologically regimented events were, to me, an unhappening process when I first saw the clock that had struck at the last second of all existence.\n\nIn 2010, I was hired by a fusion research institute in Boston, Massachusetts after I graduated from Oxford University with a double major in theoretical nuclear physics and engineering. On my first day on the job, I clocked in that morning on time quite perfectly. â8:00.01,â I thought, âjust one second off par.â After nearly a decade of research at WardenClyffe Scientificâs FuseTech division, our research committee achieved the first efficient magnetically confined fusion reaction capable of boiling water hot enough to spin a 1200 Megawatt turbine, equating the MW per hour of a normal fission reactorâs turbine. This breakthrough was only the beginning of the clean energy frontier, earning the inventor the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Nuclear Instrumentation. In 2018, our next project included doubling the size of the steel torus chassis, installing eight magnetic rings each twice the diameter of the length of an 18-wheeler trailer, and sixteen thermo conductive heavy water pipes through the center of the donut, each running to two 1400 Megawatt turbines and four cooling tanks. With over a year of assembling tens of millions of custom-manufactured parts, this 30 billion dollar project became the worldâs largest fusion reactor, about 25% larger than ITERâs Tokamak. \n\nOur goal was to produce heat. Lots of it. Exceeding the highest temperature ever produced by a factor of five: 1.1 billion degrees Fahrenheit. In three years, new developments allowed the reactor to push its temperature higher than previously thought possible, apt to turn ten turbines at 16% greater efficiency than the average American fission plant, producing one hundred times the power required to run it. The greatest flaw was maintenance. Due to the extreme temperatures, deformed aluminum tiles had to be changed every day, which was soon replaced with glass silicon fiber shingles. One day, an operator forgot to calibrate the magnetic strength of the giant coiled rings before the ignition, which usually does nothing but spark helium-3 gas. The reaction instead successfully bloomed into two bright violet bands. \n\nOnce the operator quickly turned the knob, the violet bands of ionized Helium-3 collapsed into each other into one band, releasing a surge of power directly from the machine. Upon discovering residual electricity at much lower temperatures, the use of the steam turbine was rendered economically obsolete. At just under 1 million degrees Fahrenheit, we designed the magnets to direct a string of ion bands moving clockwise at the roof of the chamber, then ignited a string of bands at the floor moving counterclockwise, milliseconds before smashing both bands together tightly around the center of the chamberâs donut hole. Each burst of energy burned at billions of degrees, generating vast amounts of power, earning our committee a Nobel Prize in Renewable Clean Energy and a multinational award. \n\nEverything was great. We saved trillions of dollars in petroleum mining and coal-burning plants in the U.S. And then we discovered something bizarre that we would later regret having ever invented the reactor. Because the polarized plasma bands collided within 100-microsecond intervals, like two rivers fighting against each otherâs currents, the Helium-3 protons created billions of microscopic black holes, firing out and hitting the chamber walls, each lasting as long as 10\\^-30 seconds compared to the Large Hadron Colliderâs 10\\^-83 second black hole lifespan. Little did we know our institute hopped on a playground of dynamite when our new clean energy vision got dumped by endeavors to study black holes. Why cut off our decade-long project in the process of revolutionizing modern civilization? Nobody is certain, except perhaps to expediently excite third-party financial investors a third time with some grandiose idea that black holes will solve the energy crisis. Lo and behold, we did just that. \n\nBy combining black holes, electrons and radiation was released into the flow of Helium atoms and their fused protons. Then those holes grew to sizes large enough to consume those protons until the current emitted a stream of electrons straight into the chamber walls. The temperature at ignition begins at 1 million degrees, then cools down to only 500 degrees Fahrenheit. While the power generated was significantly lower than expected, the power required to perpetuate the black hole stream for one hour would equate to a single AA battery, breaking our previous record for the worldâs most efficient clean energy producer. \n\nThe reason this great discovery became tragic news to us was that the fate of the world would forever be in the hands of the control deck, and we would be liable should the facility or the city of Boston, or the entire earth be sucked into a black hole. But even that would have been a better alternative to what I alone had discovered. You see, mass publicity of the most successful institute in the world breaking its world records leads to scientific arrogance in a frantic race to make history, reminiscent of the atomic bomb, the ICBM, and the Arms Race of the Cold War. Rather than a race driven by intercontinental pressure, ours was entirely a business show, like kids dissecting and showing off the coolest parts of a pressure-gauged warhead. FuseTech had unfortunately fallen victim to this ancient, intellectual arrogance. \n\nOne of the most terrifying projects I was involved in, titled, âEvent Horizons,â endeavored to open and manipulate a black hole for one second before evaporation. Members of our committee included Simon Beavers and Christopher Hopkins, two field inspectors slightly younger than me, and Dr. Gertrude, an older lady in her mid-sixties who worked as both a secretary for Dr. Manry and an operations manager. I began the first phase of ignition. All the orbiting black holes combined into just two, each the size of a grain of sand, lasting 676.6 milliseconds before both evaporated simultaneously. Then I began the second trial, forming exactly two holes orbiting opposite to each other for 950.9 milliseconds. Then the third test, 999.3 milisecs. The fourth, 999.9 milisecs. Then the fifth, barely at 999.8 milliseconds, ready to shut off. \n\nâKeep going,â Dr. Fisher Manry, the chief executive of the FuseTech divisionâs experiment, insisted, âweâre only at 200 megawatts. Shoot for 225.â \n\nThe machine boomed with a deafening hum, occasionally crackling and popping like a rocket. Bright sparks of white fire in the two opposing streams of violet-ionized gas flashed sharply on the camera monitor. I computed the collapse sequence and pulled the trigger. 1000.0 milliseconds; the one second. That instant, the chamber flashed with a loud POP of gunfire before the black holes evaporated. \n\nâShut it down!â commanded Dr. Manry. \n\nI quickly brought the reactor to a halt, turning the chamber lights on. The CCTV monitor depicted what appeared to be a thin, perfectly circular, black ring around the chamber midsection. \n\nâThe camera sensor must have been fried,â I suggested, âbeta particles can knock out light receptors and punch holes in the image.â \n\nDr. Manry said, half-listening, \n\nâInteresting. Open the bay windows.â \n\nThe thick steel doors over the control centerâs circular windows were hydraulically pried off. There it was. Floating in mid-air, wrapped around the torus center, was a black line no thinner than a hair.\n\nDr. Manry, looking nervous, turned to me, âOkay Isaac, this is where you come in. The field inspectors will meet you in the clean room to suit up. Recover a sample of the anomaly. Gertrude will be on the line.â \n\nGertrude overheard from the machine diagnostic computer and said, âYup. And radiation levels are safe. Temperatures are cool enough now for entry,â then she asked Dr. Manry, concerned, âmaybe we should wait and call authorities.â \n\nâI will if the situation calls for it. The anomaly should just be compacted diamond or dense carbon, or at worst, an unknown, highly radioactive element.â \n\nAs a physicist, I was no fool to not find that theory strange, as none of the elements ionized could fuse into carbon-based configurations unless Dr. Manry had already simulated the particle statistics. \n\nWearing lime green trash sacks for HAZMAT suits, Simon and I climbed up a four-foot ladder under the chassis, opened the bottom hatch, threw the sample kit up through the door, and climbed in. \n\nâSurreal,â I thought, as the echoey charred tile walls welcomed me with an unnatural sound reverberation you would only hear in skydome theaters elsewhere. The line was ten feet above our heads, with a radius of sixteen feet. I pulled out a Geiger counter from the supply case. \n\nâNo reading,â I tuned in. \n\nâStrange. Iâll measure again,â Dr. Gertrude said through our headsets, âtry setting your ladder up to get a better ping.â \n\nâIâll be careful not to touch it,â I promised. \n\nI climbed up the ten-foot ladder, meeting the phenomenon at eye level. Oddly enough, no radiation was detected. \n\nI tuned in, âHey Gertie (short for Gertrude), what is the gauss on the magnets?â \n\nâTheyâre zero.â \n\nâAlright. Hey Simon, can you hand me the EMF detector?â I spoke as he handed it to me, âI want to see if our magnets electrostatically crushed our particles into carbon, seeing as it is completely black.â \n\nâWhy do you think it's carbon?â Simon asked me. \n\nI thought, as though mentally doing chemistry math, \n\nâDr. Manry did, actually, but the only carbon fused here would be in the silicon shingles. I bet thatâs the problem.â I continued as I climbed the ladder, âBesides, since switching from aluminum panels, weâve always had problems, andâ¦ uhâ¦ well that canât be right.â \n\nGertie tuned in, âWhat is it, Isaac?â asking me condescendingly. \n\nâThere is absolutely no electric field around the hairline. It just looks like a razorâs edgeâ¦ totally motionless. I wonât touch it, but you could cut your finger right along it.â \n\nShe remained silent for a moment before I continued, \n\nâOkay, we are attempting to take a sample of the specimen with our handy-dandy wire cutters.â \n\nI climbed down the ladder, got the tool, and climbed up once more, with Simon holding up a test tube for me to drop a thread of wire in. \n\nSimon warned me, âCareful. Slowly cut with your eyes closed in case it flashes again,â \n\nI hovered the cutters around the hairline, shut my eyes, closed the blades, and suddenly, the ring loudly popped like a firecracker, flashing a torching white light like a magnesium oxidation reaction. I pulled back the tool, my hands stuck motionless. No. I feel my arm moving. Where did it go? Am I frozen? Paralyzed? Simon screamed when he caught sight of me, so startled he fell off the ladder. \n\nâReport Isaac. Whatâs going on?â Gertrude demanded me. \n\nBefore Simon could get the words out, I realized I was not a statue. \n\nSimon exclaimed, \n\nâIsaac! Your face. Your arm. Itâs stretching out. Crap. Donât move!â \n\nI stepped down a rung of the ladder, looking up in shock as though my right arm had fallen off. I was looking up at myself, completely motionless, holding the tools at the exact moment the cutters touched the line. I lifted my hands to see them in utter disbelief. My whole body made millions of copies of itself wherever I moved, leaving a grotesque trail of my stretched anatomy suspended motionless on the ladder. I heard fierce arguing in the control deck. \n\nGertrude commanded me in a trembling voice, \n\nâIsaac, whatever you do, do not move. Do not get off the ladder. Do not touch Simon or anyone. We are sending a team to escort you out of there safely. Simon, leave all the supplies, leave the door open, and exit now.â \n\nA long pause weighed on my traumatic situation as I saw through a thick cloud of my bright lime green suit and body parts clinging to the ladder. I saw my nose stretch when I tilted my head back, then I reinserted the nose going forward. I consoled myself with funny thoughts to distract my shaky trance, like, âIâve worked here for ten years and still canât get my head outta my butt,â as my head was currently inside the butt of my suit. Paramedics in lime green HAZMAT suits arrived outside the chamber with a stretcher. \n\nâIsaac,â Dr. Manry tuned in, âslowly climb down the ladder, go around all the supplies. Do not step over them.â\n\nI did, seeing my body stretching a long trail behind me. He continued, âDescend the ladder carefully.â \n\nWhen I climbed out of the chamber, officers, paramedics, and security personnel stood around me at a distance. \n\nâHold it. There. Thatâs good. Stay where you are,â an officer commanded. \n\nThe officer then proceeded with questions while Simon scanned me for radiation, \n\nâYou are considered too dangerous to be questioned anywhere other than where you are standing. Is that okay?â \n\nâI, uhâ¦â \n\nâAre you okay?â \n\nâI think so. I feel like Iâm in shock,â I said. \n\nâHowâs your pulse? Any heart palpitations, fibrillation, trouble breathingâ¦â \n\nâFine. Really. No different, except my body is everywhere. Iâm scared now. My knees are knocking,â I blurted out without qualms of being terrified at the sight of my hundreds of very stationary legs. \n\nI saw a horrifying lime-green worm of body parts spilling out of the reactor hatch. I wanted to say something funny to console their terrified expression just so they would know I was still human, but I knew this was more serious than I was able to fathom, so overwhelming in fact, my mind broke, drowning in diverting thoughts into an intoxicating, enigmatic hysteria like a traumatized soldier laughing at his decapitated comrade.\n\nThree men dressed for business rode with technicians on a roofless utility fleet cart through one of the side garages of the assembly building toward the crowd forming around me. I saw people begin recording me. Any attempt to cover this up has already failed at this point. Maybe they wonât need to. The technicians set up infrared cameras around me and a bomb rover with a built-in X-ray camera. Within thirty minutes, every worker on and off duty stood at a distance to record on their phones the horrifying frozen snake of arms and legs drooping out of the reactor chassis like an amalgamation of wet laundry hanging out of a washing machine. Every breath I took was ice cold, or at least, I felt my warm breath turn cold enough to sink to the floor. \n\nâIsaac, do you feel close to hypothermia?â one of the technicians of the infrared camera asked me as others gathered around to see its screen. \n\nâNot at all. Kinda hot in this suit, actually. Iâm light-headed and my legs are tired. I think I need to sit down for a minute.â \n\nA moment after I sat on the cold concrete floor, I heard a bomb rover squealing its motorized chain wheels, steering itself towards me. I overheard the techniciansâ conversation. \n\nâHe doesnât seem to have a clear heat signature. His remaining body is extremely cold. See. Thereâs Issacâ¦ on the floorâ¦we need X-rays.â One of them called out to me, \n\nâIsaac, hold still real quick. Weâre taking your X-rayâ¦ in threeâ¦twoâ¦oneâ¦â The rover snapped photos, retracted its camera arm, deployed a laser thermometer, and aimed it along my elongated mass. \n\nâHow?â the bewildered operator said, âHeâs deadly cold. Below freezing. Itâs reading -271.1C.â Dr. Manry stood behind the operator and technicians, staring dumbfounded at the screen, postulated, \n\nâHis atoms appear frozen in time. Thermal radiation canât emit from them. No radiation except visible light seems to reflect off of his suit.â \n\nThe rover touched one of my contorted gloves that protruded from the ladder. \n\nâSolid,â the technician said, âlike a solid wall. His hands are firmly stuck to the ladder. I don't know how weâre going to get it off.â \n\nThe rover poked at the sleeve, expecting the plastic suit to wrinkle, but it was frozen, as though I had bathed in liquid nitrogen. He then began a second phase of experimentation,\n\nâIsaac, weâre taking a sample of your suit now. To be safe, we will cut some rubber off your boot and the tips of your laces. Extend your leg and donât reach out to assist the robot.â \n\nThe rover cut rubber from the sole of my left boot, then it cut and pulled the shoelace out, leaving trails where they lightly swung from the toy claw, and dropped each into separate test tubes. He said, \n\nâCrap. I didnât think this through. The tube is stuck.â \n\nDr. Manry corrected, \n\nâTurn it on its side, in his direction, and pull it out.â \n\nThe rover drove away, carrying the glass bottle with the opening facing toward my boot, drawing a dark rubber line in mid-air. Then the bottle shattered when the shoe laceâs trail filled its volume. After a quarter-hour of recovering the samples uncontained on ceramic dishes, Dr. Manry made a call after some dispute of how I would be moved without leaving streaks of my every atom in the facility. \n\nâFeds are on their way,â I heard him murmur. \n\nI sat for three hours, buried in not-so-solid parts of my body. It was dark in here. Outside voices became muffled. I heard an affirmative call, \n\nâHow are we doing in there, Isaac?â \n\nI felt crippled like I had lost eyesight, coping with thoughts of an unforeseen lifestyle I now have to endure. \n\nâIâm worried I wonât ever leave this place again. I think Iâm going to die. The more I move, the more âmeâ there is.â \n\nI could tell no one was listening. I was, in their eyes, just a circus anomaly. I lay on my back, dizzy from existential stress. Gertie was right. We shouldâve waited to call the authorities.\n\nI heard a helicopter beating wind on the roof of the enormous assembly building, landing somewhere near the parking lot. I heard news crews gather at the site. I slowly crawled out of the amalgamation to see hundreds of photographers outside the building fenced behind police tape. Flashing red and blue lights flooded my vision as black vans swarmed the grass lot, and multiple military helicopters landed close to the building as I overheard the distinct chatter of, âPresident.â The Massachusetts state governor with the state attorney general arrived shortly after. \n\nAn hour later as the sun was setting, there he was. U.S. President Conner Reinking flew from the White House, arriving in Boston in the Marine One helicopter, landing on one of the empty lots. I never felt such surreal notoriety before upon seeing the man of America duck under the police tape, saluted by the marine corps as the green alien beast befell his eyes. Then I heard a distinctly familiar female voice calling my name. \n\nâIsaac!â she called for me. \n\nI stood up, completely obscured by my bodies, and inched myself forward to see her. I thought I must be dreaming. My wife stood in front of a crowd of over a hundred scientists, police officers, military personnel, paramedics, doctors with radiation equipment and satellite dishes, and men in black. \n\nâAmelia?â I called out, but the crowd was too loud to hear me. \n\nThe President greeted Amelia, standing next to her to speak first before handing a megaphone to her. The crowd silenced, and the teams stopped what they were doing. He then turned the volume up just enough to hear him address me, stepped up on a soapbox, and said, \n\nâMr. Coffman, this is the President speaking. Can you hear me?â \n\nâYes Mr. President,â I said enthusiastically. \n\nâI came to inform you that five research institutes from around the world are working tirelessly, determined that they will not stop until they have completely restored you back to your family. Mr. Coffman, I give you a word of hope for you and your family and encouragement in this arduous situation. America bends a knee of prayer that you return home safely.â \n\nI responded, \n\nâThank God. Please get me out of here! My face is in my crotch, I think. I will be okay for a while.â\n\nThe President chuckled, affirming me, \n\nâNow, Mrs. Amelia, your beloved wife, has some words for you,â \n\nShe stepped up, megaphone in hand, and said anxiously,\n\nâIsaac. Isaac, wherever you are, Iâm here for you. Iâm scared. Be strong for me, okay?â \n\nI inched forward, revealing my form outside the floating lime-green mass, hearing her lightly gasp. \n\nâIâm here, honey,â I said faintly. \n\nI unzipped the suitâs head and took off my mask, showing my rapidly smearing face. \n\nâIâm coming home. Donât worry. Iâll be strong. Theyâre gonna get me out of here,â I bravely ascertained through the frozen statue of my face. \n\nâHoo-rah,â all the rescue teams cheered, along with members of various divisions and first responders chanting, âUSA! USA!â \n\nI then asked Amelia, âWhere are the boys?â \n\nâIn the lounge. I can bring them here.â \n\nâPlease do,â I said as my voice broke into a cry at the thought that I was standing inside my grave, ready to be buried alive. \n\nThey came, and I wanted to hug them. A single handshake would fuse their hands to a freezing claw. The boys spoke to me like I lived to hear my eulogy. My oldest son said, \n\nâEveryone is in the lounge.â \n\nâReally? Okay. Can you tell grandpa Iâm alright? Also, there is a soda machine down the hall on the right. Can you roll me a can?â \n\nHe chuckled, âIâll tell grandpa to get you a pickle, âcause you sure look like one.â \n\nâHa!â \n\nâAny flavor?â He asked. \n\nâYeah. Except for Fanta. I donât like sour juices. Grandpa might have some cash.â \n\nI then asked Amelia, âHey honey, what time is it?â \n\nâItâs almost eight oâclock,â She said before the President got word of tonightâs plan. \n\nShe gave him the megaphone and he announced, \n\nâMr. Coffman, I got good news and bad news. Iâll tell you the bad first. You are going to have to sleep where you are tonight while the international society of nuclear science pulls an all-nighter to assess possible solutions. The good news is, a report will be written and ready to begin trials tomorrow.â \n\nAt around 11 pm, the news and press crews began to leave, then the men in black with the President and the marines thirty minutes later. All members of the science community left by midnight.\n\nI could not be any more grateful to Gertrude and the rest of my team, because hours after their shift ended, they stayed here to support me until all was assessed for the night. I was given a mattress, sheets, and a toilet sheltered by a curtain rack. I laid my head down, unable to pull the blankets over me. I wondered where my family slept. They probably went home. Nonetheless, I was alone in the dark, seeing only a green ceiling alarm light flash occasionally and hearing the motors of ventilation units starting and stopping. \n\nThen came the silence.",

        "text": "(Using a burner so I donât ruin my own life)\n\nI never believed in the Illuminati or secret societies. That was until I became a detective in Hollywood.\n\nAssigned to investigate a string of high-profile heists, I found myself hitting a dead end. That is until I received a tip from an informant.\n\nHe told me about a group of magicians and propagandists known as the \"Florist Friars.\" They were a group of avant-garde artists and businessmen who used a Robin Hood philosophy to make media to promote the individual freedoms of their audience against the tyranny of big tech and big media. They used their knowledge and resources to influence Hollywood's politics and economy to their advantage and to fight against the corruption and criminal activity of the Illuminati in the name of the common man.\n\nSkeptical at first, I found myself diving deeper into the case. I soon realized that the Florist Friars were the only ones making any real progress against the Illuminati. With their help, we were able to infiltrate the inner circles and gather valuable intelligence.\n\nBut that was just the beginning. The secrets I uncovered during this case have stayed with me to this day. The true nature of the Illuminati and the Florist Friars is more sinister than you could ever imagine.\n\nThe Illuminati's reach was far greater than I ever envisioned. They controlled everything from the media to the government, pulling the strings behind the scenes to maintain their power and influence.\n\nI soon realized that the Florist Friars were the only ones brave enough to stand up against them. They used their knowledge of magic and propaganda to infiltrate the Illuminati's inner circles, gathering valuable intelligence and using it to fight back against their nefarious plans.\n\nBut the Florist Friars weren't just fighting a battle against the Illuminati, they were also fighting a battle against time. The Illuminati were always one step ahead, always watching, always waiting for the opportunity to strike.\n\nOne night, as I sat with the Florist Friars, planning our next move, we received word that the Illuminati had uncovered our operation. We were compromised. We had to act fast if we wanted to survive.\n\nWe quickly devised a plan to infiltrate the Illuminati's stronghold and take them down once and for all. It was a risky move, but we had no other choice.\n\nWith the Florist Friars by my side, I infiltrated the stronghold and uncovered a network of tunnels and secret rooms that led deep into the heart of the Illuminati's operations. We found evidence of their dark rituals and twisted experiments. We found proof of their plans to control the world's population through mind control and manipulation.\n\nBut as we were about to make our escape, we were ambushed by the Illuminati's guards. We were outnumbered and outgunned, but the Florist Friars fought bravely, using their knowledge of magic to turn the tide of the battle.\n\nThe Florist Friars' ultimate weapon in the fight against the Illuminati was a comedy film that they released. The film was a satire that exposed the Illuminati's true nature and their nefarious plans to the public. It went viral, and the public finally saw the truth. The movie was a huge success, and it played a vital role in the ultimate downfall of the Illuminati.\n\nThe Florist Friars continue to fight against the Illuminati and other secret societies to this day. If you want to know more about their ongoing battle, check out their YouTube channel or website. They use comedy films to fight the Illuminati and share their message. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. www.youtube.com/@floristfriars/ or www.friars.florist/",

        "text": "THE SECRET OF LIFE\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe human being is reluctant to miseries and enjoys the happy situation. The human being can be compared to an ignorant child, who enjoys the sweets only and is reluctant to chillies. Hence, such a human being is ignorant. The grown up adult enjoys both sweets and chillies in the meals. Similarly, a realized soul enjoys both happy situation and miseries in the life. Therefore, it is only ignorance, which is the inability of art of enjoyment. God created this world with happiness and misery. People enjoy the cinema, which contains both pleasant scenes and tragic scenes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilarly, people enjoy both sweet dishes and hot dishes in the meals. People enjoy the day and night. People enjoy the hot summer and the cold winter. The whole life and creation is full of alternating happiness and misery. If a person can enjoy both happy times and miseries in the life, he is equal to God. You may say that God enjoys the creation from outside. God also enters the creation in the form of human incarnation and enjoys both pleasant times and miseries in the life span. We see this truth in the life history of Rama and Krishna. Therefore, if you always crave for happiness only and reject miseries, it is unnatural and also ignorance of a child. The knowledge of the Gita preaches that you should enjoy even a top most misery, which is the time of death.\n\n\t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you enjoy both miseries and happy situations, you are in a continuous state of enjoyment. You think that continuous enjoyment comes only through continuous times of happiness in the life. It is not correct. You get bored if you are served only with sweet dishes in the meals. Boring is misery. Therefore, misery is inevitable like summer after winter and winter after summer. The Indians denote happiness through cooling. The foreigners represent happiness through warming, which is heat. Therefore, the happiness to one is misery to the other. What is the reason? The foreigner is mainly exposed to winter, which bores him. Therefore, for a foreigner, the heat is happiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n The Indian is mainly exposed to summer and therefore, cool atmosphere is happiness to him. This is a practical proof that the enjoyment is not confined to happy scene or tragic scene only. This also proves that you can enjoy both happiness and misery. Therefore, it is ignorance to ask God for removal of misery and sanction of continuous happiness. Happiness should lie in the process of enjoyment. Whether it is misery or happiness, you will find real happiness in the process of enjoyment of both. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe happiness neither lies in the sweet dish nor in the hot dish. The happiness lies in the process of eating the dish, which may be hot or sweet. If this secret of life is known, you will never pray God for removal of problems and tensions. You will enjoy the problems and tensions and hence, there is nothing to pray God for something. Your prayer to God must be due to your attraction to Him for His excellent personality. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour praise of God must be based on your love for His divine personality. But, today we find most of the people praying God for sanction of continuous sweet dishes. Therefore, the desire for something gets smashed if you know the secret of this concept. Hence, there is no meaning in wishing somebody for a happy new year because continuous happiness bores and leads to misery only. The aspiration for continuous happiness through out the year is based on foolishness and ignorance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the New Year, you must pray God thinking His divine personality and get attracted for His divine quality. You must at least achieve one of His basic qualities, which is enjoying both happy scenes and tragic scenes in the creation. On the Telugu New Year day, people generally take sweets and sour items mixed as offering of God (Prasadam), which shows the same concept of enjoyment of both happy and tragic movements in the life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the divine knowledge in nutshell present in all the divine scriptures of all religions. This is essence of the Gita preached by Lord Krishna. He enjoyed continuously in His life and even in the last situation, when He was shot dead by a hunter. This is essence to be learnt and practiced by every human being in this world. \n\n\t\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[WWW.universal-spirituality.org](https://WWW.universal-spirituality.org)\n\nUniversal Spirituality for World Peace",

They controlled everything from the media to the government, pulling the strings behind the scenes to maintain their power and influence.\n\nI soon realized that the Florist Friars were the only ones brave enough to stand up against them. They used their knowledge of magic and propaganda to infiltrate the Illuminati's inner circles, gathering valuable intelligence and using it to fight back against their nefarious plans.\n\nBut the Florist Friars weren't just fighting a battle against the Illuminati, they were also fighting a battle against time. The Illuminati were always one step ahead, always watching, always waiting for the opportunity to strike.\n\nOne night, as I sat with the Florist Friars, planning our next move, we received word that the Illuminati had uncovered our operation. We were compromised. We had to act fast if we wanted to survive.\n\nWe quickly devised a plan to infiltrate the Illuminati's stronghold and take them down once and for all. It was a risky move, but we had no other choice.\n\nWith the Florist Friars by my side, I infiltrated the stronghold and uncovered a network of tunnels and secret rooms that led deep into the heart of the Illuminati's operations. We found evidence of their dark rituals and twisted experiments. We found proof of their plans to control the world's population through mind control and manipulation.\n\nBut as we were about to make our escape, we were ambushed by the Illuminati's guards. We were outnumbered and outgunned, but the Florist Friars fought bravely, using their knowledge of magic to turn the tide of the battle.\n\nIn the end, we emerged victorious. The Illuminati's stronghold lay in ruins and their leaders were captured or killed. But the true nature of the Illuminati and the Florist Friars is more sinister than you could ever imagine.\n\nThe Florist Friars' ultimate weapon in the fight against the Illuminati was a comedy film that they released. The film was a satire that exposed the Illuminati's true nature and their nefarious plans to the public. It went viral, and the public finally saw the truth. The movie was a huge success, and it played a vital role in the ultimate downfall of the Illuminati.\n\nThe Florist Friars continue to fight against the Illuminati and other secret societies to this day. If you want to know more about their ongoing battle, check out their YouTube channel or website. They use comedy films to fight the Illuminati and share their message. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.[ www.youtube.com/@floristfriars/](http://www.youtube.com/@floristfriars/) or[ www.friars.florist/](http://www.friars.florist/)",

        "text": "I know how it sounds. Believe me, I do. When I tell you that there is someone else living inside my home, who only I am able to see, your first conclusion is probably that I'm suffering from hallucinations. That's what I initially believed as well.\n\nI think the first sign of my unwanted guest was a couple weeks ago. I was putting in a load of laundry, only to notice that the back door was slightly ajar. Seeing the darkness outside contrasting with the light of the laundry room filled me with an odd sort of dread. My husband and I lived in a fairly safe neighborhood, so I shouldn't have been too worried about the possibility of someone sneaking in, but it still felt like someone had trodden on my grave nonetheless.\n\nPulling myself together, I closed the door, locked it, and got back to work with the laundry, trying to put what I thought was simple paranoia out of my mind. As I clicked the lock shut, I swore I heard something like a faint breath right behind me, but when I turned my head there was nothing there. Feeling a bit spooked, I headed back to the living room, gently reminding my husband not to leave the back door unlocked.\n\nI didn't actually *see* anything for a while, but I frequently felt like I was being observed. I'd be at home alone, watching TV, cleaning, or doing some other mundane task, when I would suddenly feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I'd turn around and there wouldn't be anyone there.\n\nI would sometimes hear faint breathing too, under the bed, from the closet, on the other side of the shower curtains while I was brushing my teeth. Whenever I'd check though, I would be greeted with nothing. Just empty space, though occasionally I could detect a faint, musty odor.\n\nThis continued for about week, and I was beginning to get quite jumpy. I started regularly checking the house from top to bottom, every day, just making sure there wasn't any possibility of someone being there. I'd even look in the crawlspace under the house with a flashlight. I never saw anything that even suggested there might have been an intruder. But the tension, the paranoia, it didn't go away.\n\nThen, finally, I saw him. It was late at night, and I was up getting a glass of water. I was about to take a sip, when I saw something reflected in the shiny black surface of the fridge.\n\nIt was a pale face, grinning at me from the shadows.\n\nInstantly I wheeled around, dropping my glass in the process, causing it to shatter into a hundred pieces upon the tile floor. I hardly noticed though, because the face was *still there*. It hadn't just been a trick of the light, or a brief moment of pareidolia, there was actually a man peering at me from the shadows of the dining room.\n\nHe was tall, but not unusually so, perhaps slightly shy of 6 feet at the most. His face was stretched into a smug, close-lipped grin, with half-open eyes giving an impression of sleepy contentment. He was nude, and entirely hairless, including on the top of his head.\n\nI screamed in horror and grabbed a cleaver from the knife rack, in case I needed to defend myself. Moments later, I heard my husband come rushing down the hallway, asking what was wrong. As I watched, the naked intruder put a finger to his lips and shook his head.\n\nAt this point my husband burst into the room, clutching a baseball bat. \"What happened? What's wrong?\" he asked, audibly panicked.\n\nUnable to speak, I pointed towards the strange man, hand shaking. My husband looked into the dark, visibly straining his eyes. He moved closer to the intruder, who was still standing there, smiling smugly and staring at me with those half lidded eyes. My husband turned on the light switch, fully illuminating the stranger, but still didn't seem to notice him.\n\n\"What's wrong honey,?I don't see anything\" my husband asked, standing less than a foot away from the intruder.\n\nI swallowed, trying as hard as I could not to look at the naked man in my dining room, his smile widening ever so slightly. It didn't help, I couldn't stop staring at him. I've never suffered from delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, or any other symptoms of mental illness, but at that moment I thought I was going crazy.\n\n\"Oh i-it's nothing dear. I t-thought I saw someone at the window, but\", I paused for a moment, staring at the nude man, who was subtly nodding his head, \"it was just a trick of the light. I'm sorry for waking you up honey.\"\n\nMy husband set down the baseball bat and moved in for a hug, offering words of comfort as he wrapped his arms around me. I didn't hear any of them though, I was still focused on the intruder. No matter how hard I tried to will him to disappear, he refused to cease existing. As I watched, the man winked at me, and took a seat at the table.\n\nMy husband led me back to bed, but even as I followed him, our hands intertwined, I couldn't help but look back at the naked man in my dining room, waving farewell at me slowly. His half-closed eyes reflected the faint light of the moon through the uncovered window with sickening malice.\n\nI didn't sleep at all that night. How could I? At that time, I was convinced something inside of me had snapped, but for the life of me I couldn't think of anything that would have caused it. I'm a stay-at-home spouse, so it wasn't work that could be causing it, and I'd had ample opportunities for social interaction, so clearly I wasn't losing my mind due to isolation. As far as I knew my family never had any especial predilection towards mental illness.\n\nMy thoughts raced through my mind like rats in a maze until the sun's rays poured through the bedroom window. I waited until my husband awoke before I felt comfortable leaving bed, I didn't much relish the thought of being the only one awake, in case our unwanted guest was still here.\n\nWhen my husband finally got up, late in the morning, I accompanied him out to have breakfast. To my horror, the intruder was still there, still sitting at the table. I processed for the first time that he was sitting at my usual spot.\n\nAfter my husband and I prepared a breakfast of scrambled eggs and sausages, we made our way to the table. The intruder sat there, unmoving, his half-closed eyes fixed on me. His smug smile seemed to dare me to try and sit down on his lap.\n\nI sat on the opposite side of the table as normal, next to my husband. I noticed him raise an eyebrow, but he didn't say anything, so I didn't explain myself. Throughout breakfast my husband tried to make conversation, but I only answered with monosyllabic responses and grunts. It was hard to focus with the naked man staring at me. I finished breakfast quickly, and then got up to go take a shower. I pretended not to notice as the intruder licked my plate clean.\n\nI triple checked that the bathroom door was locked, and then took my time trying my best to relax in the hot water. I knew that I'd regret taking such a long shower when my water bill would come in, but I tried not to focus on that. Instead I just tried to calm myself down. It almost worked, until I heard the dreadful squeaking of skin on glass.\n\nI pulled aside the curtain and screamed. Standing in front of the sink, head turned to look back at me, stood the intruder, smirking. On the mirror, drawn with a finger on the fogged up surface, was a smiley face.\n\nOnce again, my husband ran into the room at the sound of my cry, the door seemingly unlocked.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" he asked, concern on his face. He still didn't seem to notice the nude man.\n\n\"I'm fine\", I lied, \"I j-just slipped, I'm alright. Um, honey, d-did you draw that on the mirror?\" I pointed to the smiley face on the glass. I knew sometimes that things drawn in the condensation on mirrors could reappear once exposed to more steam, and I hoped to God that my husband had just idly doodled it.\n\n\"What, the smiley face? No, I don't think so. Why? Are you sure you're okay?\" he asked, visibly confused. The grin of the intruder who only I could see grew slightly wider.\n\nI mumbled out that I was fine and stepped out of the shower, putting on a bathrobe and trying as hard as I could not to accidentally brush against the stranger. I felt his stare bore into the back of my skull as I left the bathroom to go get dressed.\n\nThe next couple days passed fairly similarly. No matter how hard I tried to will the intruder to vanish, he still remained. If I was watching TV with my husband, he would lie curled up under the coffee table, smirking at me. At dinner he would sit down in my regular chair, never breaking eye contact. He even started standing at the foot of my bed at night.\n\nI almost got used to it, that's the worst part. I just began to accept that I had gone crazy, that this hallucinatory nudist was going to follow me around for the rest of my life. Then he started escalating things.\n\nI once woke up earlier than my husband and went out into the kitchen. I paused in front of the refrigerator and gasped in horror and disgust as I saw what was attached to it.\n\nAffixed to the fridge door with a cheap magnet was a sheet of printer paper covered in the most vile obscenities I had ever read. Slurs directed against my husband, crude drawings of swastikas and racist caricatures, allegations that I was cheating on him with his best friend, etc. I glanced over to the dining room and saw my guest grinning, half-closed eyes full of sadistic glee.\n\nI tore the sheet of paper into little pieces and tossed them in the recycling bin, refusing to acknowledge the intruder's presence. The rest of the day passed fairly normally, though every time I looked over at the nude stranger I felt my stomach lurch.\n\nThings escalated quickly after the note on the fridge. I found rusted nails left outside the bedroom door. A condom (opened, but thankfully unused) was left on my husband's desk. One day when I went to go make some oatmeal raisin cookies, I opened up the jar of raisins only to find hundreds of dead flies, their wings meticulously plucked off. Every time, I would look over at the intruder, and he would make eye contact with me, as if daring me to speak out. And every time, I would say nothing and just clean up the mess.\n\nYou have to understand, I was convinced that I was just doing these things on my own, as if I was in some sort of trance. I considered putting up security cameras to catch myself in the act, but I was horrified by the possibility that I might see something else.\n\nThere was one thing that put doubt in my mind, however, something that made me feel that the intruder might be something real. Our cat, Horace, could see him too.\n\nWhenever the stranger was near him, Horace would hiss and his tail would puff up. On one occasion, he even swiped at him, drawing blood. The intruder leapt backwards, and for the first time I saw his half-closed eyes open fully, his smug grin turning into an open-toothed grimace of rage and pain.\n\nAs the cat ran off to hide in the bedroom, my husband laughed and remarked \"Silly critter isn't he? I wonder what's gotten him so worked up.\"\n\nTwo days ago came the final blow which both proved the intruder's reality and destroyed my marriage.\n\nI had gone out for a walk, to try and clear my head a bit, while my husband was at work. I decided to go on a fairly long hike through the nearby forest, and as a result, when I got back it was nearly 5:30. When I stepped through my front door the first thing I noticed was the smell, a metallic tang like rust or ozone. It was so alien to my home that it took me a few moments before my brain processed the scent of blood.\n\nGrabbing my walking stick like a club and fearing the worst, I crept towards the smell, which seemed to be emanating from the kitchen. As I rounded the corner, I tried my best not to vomit.\n\nThe tile floor, cabinets, and fridge were splattered with blood. Nailed to one of the higher cabinets, viscera dangling out like party streamers, was the mangled, flayed corpse of Horace. Scraps of fur and skin were strewn about the floor in disgusting heaps. In the corner, covered in blood and scratches, sat the cross-legged form of the intruder, grinning with infinite, repulsive smugness. Written on the wall in still-wet cat blood were the words \"More than one way\" with a smiley face underneath.\n\nI readied myself to attack the stranger, to bash his brains in with my improvised club, but it was at that instant that my husband came home.\n\nI don't want to relive that moment. The things that he said to me. My sobbing insistence that I didn't do this. The disbelief on my husband's face as I finally told him about the intruder. The disgusting, perverse delight in the stranger's smile as I pointed towards him. Finally, I once again gripped the walking stick and moved to kill the intruder, confident that maybe in death he would become visible.\n\nIt didn't work. Whenever I moved to attack the intruder, he would simply leap out of the way, causing my strike to hit the floor, or the counter. I only stopped when the walking stick finally broke, and I fell down sobbing on to the bloodstained floor.\n\nMy husband left in a hurry, yelling something about divorce. I half-hoped that he would just call 911, that I'd be dragged off to a psychiatric institution and pumped full of drugs until I couldn't feel anything anymore. But no, he just ran off, slamming the door on the way out.\n\nI've been alone in the house with the intruder for over a day now. With my husband gone, he's only gotten worse. He's smashed all the easily breakable objects in the house, torn up all the pillows and blankets, and broke the TV with one of my husband's golf clubs. I tried to stop him at first, but no matter what I did, he always managed to evade my grasp. Eventually I just gave up.\n\nI don't know what the intruder is, or why he has done any of this. I know I didn't kill Horace, I know that I physically couldn't have, given that I was out hiking at the time. I don't understand why only I can see him.\n\nI'm so tired. I haven't slept in over 24 hours. Whenever I try to leave the house, the stranger blocks my way, and I am far too afraid to test the limits of his strength. I can't sleep, I am horrified of what he might do now that there are no witnesses.\n\nI don't know what to do. Please help me.",

        "text": " \n\nWe're not like the others. Please, we desperately need some advice.\n\nMy first memory was as a toddler, crawling over to the fence of the playpen. Using my small hands, I tried to push over the fence to join the adults at the table. Even at such a young age, I thought it was unfair.\n\n\"Oh my, how big you're getting!\" Ms. Devanna reached over the fence to pick me up. I cried into her shoulder as she bounced me up and down. \"I know you want to join the rest of the family, but I have something special for you.\"\n\nShe held out the bottle to me, and I sucked on it. I grabbed the bottle between my chubby hands, tilting it further back to get every single last drop. Even though there was nothing left, I was still hungry.\n\nI continued to cry, reaching towards the table. I didn't know what they were having, but I wanted it.\n\nMs. Devanna carried me back into my bedroom, setting me down carefully in my crib.\n\nThe next day when I woke up, one of my legs was sticking through the wooden legs of the crib. I cried and yelled out, desperately trying to free my leg.\n\n\"What is going on in there?\" A gruff voice came through the door. I yelled more, hoping that he would come in to help me. Instead, he slammed his fist against the door. \"Keep quiet! Devanna! Get it to shut up!\"\n\nI kicked against the wood with my free leg several times, but it was too strong. \n\nThe door opened.\n\nIt was Ms. Devanna. When she looked at me, concern filled her face. She stepped over to my crib and looked down at me.\n\n\"Oh my, you're stuck! Here, why don't I help you out of there?\" She grabbed my foot with a light touch, twisting it softly before pushing my leg through the hole. It hurt a little, but when I was free, I started to laugh and smile at her.\n\nI stood up on the mattress, jumping up at her for her to pick me up. She struggled to support my weight this time before setting me back down on the floor. She turned to the crib, hands on her hips. \"It looks like we're going to need to get you a bigger bed.\"\n\nI sat there, pointing to my mouth. \"Hungry.\"\n\nShe smiled at me and pulled another bottle from her apron. This one was bigger than the one I had yesterday, which made me excited. \"Drink up, Nahom. This will help you grow big and strong.\"\n\nBy the time Ms. Devanna cleaned up the broken pieces of wood from the floor, I could already get to a standing position on my own. As she was taking apart the crib, I started to walk. I stepped to the curtain covering the entrance to my room and pulled it open quietly.\n\nThis was the first time I could make it out of the room on my own, and I snuck out of the room without Ms. Devanna noticing.\n\nI went to the left down the hallway, peeking through some of the different rooms. One room looked like another bedroom. There were two sets of bunk beds, with each of them having their own curtains to block the bed from view.\n\nIn the corner of the hallway, I saw another curtain hanging from a rod on the ceiling. I pulled the curtain to the side and peeked my head in. There was a boy. He looked a little older than me. Not yet a teenager, but almost.\n\nI watched as he bounced a small red ball against the wall across from his bed. It would hit the wall, bounce on the floor, and return to him. I watched this happen a few times, and without noticing, I leaned too hard on the curtain, causing it to screech against the rod.\n\nThe boy turned to me.\n\n\"Oh, hey. Who are you? What are you doing in my room?\"\n\n\"I'm Nahom. What's your name?\"\n\nâRyuk.â\n\nBefore either of us could say anything else, I felt a hand on my back and jumped. It was Ms. Devanna.\n\n\"Nahom! Please don't wander off like that again. Come on, let's go back to your room. I fixed it for you.\"\n\nI waved goodbye to Ryuk before following Ms. Devanna back to my room. To my surprise, she didn't just fix the crib. She changed the entire room for me. Instead of just the crib in the middle of the room, there was a small bed in the corner, similar to Ryuk's bed. I excitedly bounced up and down on the mattress. \n\nA few hours after she left, and I was bored. There wasn't much to do here alone in my room. I needed to explore again. Luckily, it was still day time. There wasn't a window in my room, but I could tell because the rest of the house hadn't returned home yet. I didn't know where they went. All I knew was that I wasn't allowed to join them.\n\nRather than going down the left side, I decided to head down the right. Even though I yearned to visit my new friend, I also wanted to explore more of the house.\n\nMost of the other rooms are all similar, several bunk beds tightly cramped into small rooms with individual curtains. When I reached the end of the hall, there was one door left for me to explore.\n\nWhen I pushed it open, this was the first room that was different. Inside, there were several sacks lining each wall. Four on each side. The sacks looked had small, clear tubes that connected them to the wall. As I stepped closer, I was able to get a better look at them. The sacks were made up of small fibers, and as I touched them, they stuck to my fingers. \n\nWhat was all of this?\n\nIn the back of the room was another door, but this one had a deadbolt on it to keep it locked. No matter how hard I tried to pull on it, it wouldn't open. Instead, I turned my attention back to the sacks.\n\nI knelt in front of one, pulling the fibers away from the top part. I clawed away at the fibers, revealing the thing underneath. \n\nIt was a face.\n\nThe man's eyes were closed, and sweat glued several long strands of his black hair to his face. I reached out to move the hair from his face when a voice caught me off guard.\n\n\"Nahom! What are you doing here?\"\n\nShe grabs me by the arm, pulling me from the room before pulling the door shut.\n\n\"What was that? Who are those people in there? Why are they in thoseâ¦ things?\"\n\nShe clasped her hand over my mouth, bringing a finger to hers. \"Please, keep quiet. You can't let anyone know you went in there, understood? The others are going to come back soon andâ¦\"\n\nBefore she could finish, the front door in the living room slammed, shaking the walls and floors. She pulled me by the arm into the kitchen just as the others were setting down their bags on the couch. One of them glares at me.\n\n\"Why is that here? Shouldn't you keep it in the room?\"\n\n\"I wanted to bring him out to see the rest of the house. He's getting older and more curious.\"\n\nA woman speaks up. \"I really don't think that's such a good idea. Can't you just give it the food and send it back to its room? I don't like having it around.\"\n\nMy chest started to tighten, and I could feel the tears welling up in my eyes. I didn't even know these people. Why were they being so mean?\n\nMs. Devanna grabbed a bottle and filled it with more of my food. She hurried back over to me, handing it to me before grabbing me by the hand and guiding me back to my room. Once there, she sat me down on my bed and watched as I drank the food.\n\n\"Why doesn't anyone here like me? Why can't I eat with anyone else? I thought once I grew up, the others would accept me and let me be with them. Why are they so mean?\"\n\nI saw tears well up in her eyes, and her head fell between her hands. \"Please Nahom, don't ask these kinds of questions. Don't worry about them, they don't matter. Just worry about yourself, okay?\"\n\nI nodded. She stands up to leave, but I interrupted her. \"Don't you have anything here that I can do? Games or anything I can play with? I'm just so bored here all alone.\" \n\nShe searched through the closet, moving things around to see what she can find. She pulled out a small toy car and some books. \"I'm sorry. This is all we have. Will this work?\"\n\nMy heart sank, but I pretended to like her gifts, anyway. I knew she was trying, but I wished that there was more.\n\nOnce she left, I set the toy aside and took a look through some of the books. I started with the smaller ones at first, and I couldn't understand lots of the words. But by the time I got to the end of it, I was able to understand all of it clearly. \n\nI moved to the bigger books, and soon the pile of completed books stood taller than the ones that were left to read.\n\nFootsteps outside my curtain passed down the hallway, and I heard the doors close. Everyone else must have been going to sleep, but at least I was able to stay up late to continue reading. I didn't have to wake up early.\n\nA few minutes into the next book, I hear light footsteps come up to my curtain. It opened, and Ryuk stood in the hallway. He pulled it shut behind him before coming over to my bed.\n\n\"Hey Nahom, what are you up to?\"\n\nHe looked different. His face now showed signs of a black mustache growing, and he was a lot taller.\n\n\"Just reading some books. Ms. Devanna found some in my closet and gave them to me. But what are you doing here? We aren't supposed to leave our bedrooms.\"\n\n\"I'm just so bored. There's nothing for us to do around here, and I don't understand why they won't let us leave our rooms. When one of the adults walked past my room, I tried talking to them. But all they did was ignore me.\"\n\nMy shoulders drooped. I didn't know he was experiencing the same thing that I was. I thought I was the only one they didn't seem to like.\n\nRyuk sat on the floor. I offered him one of the books, but he declined. Having him there playing with his ball was distracting me from reading. I felt bad that I couldn't do more to entertain him.\n\n\"Hey, do you want to see something cool?\"\n\n\"Not something from one of your books, right?\"\n\nI shook my head and motioned for him to follow me. We peeked our heads out to see down the hallway, but no one was around. I grabbed him by the hand, guiding him towards the room at the end of the hall. It still wasn't locked.\n\nWhen I brought him into the room, he looked around in amazement.\n\n\"What is all of this?\" \n\n\"I don't know. I found this earlier today, but Ms. Devanna pulled me away. She wouldn't tell me what any of this was.\"\n\nHe gasped as he saw into the face of the person I had seen earlier. He knelt down in front of the body, inspecting it further. Before I could stop him, he started to rip away at the sack, pulling more and more fibers from the body.\n\n\"Wait, Ryuk stop! What are you doing? They're going to find out.\"\n\nBut he didn't respond. He just kept pulling more and more fibers away. He only stopped once most of the body was visible.\n\nHe grabbed one of the arms, holding it up to the light. There was a small red circle near the elbow. Then he turned his arm towards me to see. There was the same small red circle on the same spot on his arm. His eyes widened, and he looked back at me. \"Nahom? What's going on? Why does he look just like me?\"\n\nNow we're back in my room, huddled together in the corner of my bed. I don't know what is going on here, and neither does Ryuk. We were able to sneak out of the room, but not before we looked at the other sacks. One of them had someone that looked just like me, but older. Ryuk helped me sneak into one of the other bedrooms to steal someone's phone, and we found this app on here. \n\nWe are in desperate need of some help on what to do before anyone else wakes up. Are they going to do the same thing to us once we reach that age?\n\nSomething tells me we can't stay here any longer.",

        "text": "Itâs going to be a long story so get ready. \n\nI came to this house during the beginning of 2016. At first everything was fine and then months laters I felt like this house was weird. I was young so I couldnât explain it but I was joking with my mom saying that my house was haunted. \n\nI always felt I was being watched by someone in my living room, my garage and my bed room. I does not feel safe anywhere except my motherâs bed room. \n\nMy first paranormal thing that happened is one day years ago (before covid, I think it was 2019 or 2018), it was late at night because I always go sleep late and I always take a shower before going to bed, and when I left the bathroom and I was going to climb the stairs (I also want to specify that the stairs have \"holes\" ie I can see below (I don't know what it's called) so I can see part of the stairs from below and a bit of my ground floor) and when I was about to take my first step to go upstairs I saw a man with a bit coat, a hat and a suitcase almost like if someone was going home after a long day of work. It was so realistic and the man was so chill that it was really scary. He walked the stairs below me and he was going to arrive to where was so I was so scared that I run to my bedroom. I never saw his face and never saw him again. Now I regret it because I would have wait to see his faces or anything else. But he was just so chill and it was almost like it was his house and he came back from work after a long day.\n\nAlmost feel like he didn't notice me and it was him coming back to his house after work. I heard people saying that if you see that men, it means someone is gonna die soon and my grand pa died months after this.\n\nI also have a hatch that is sealed on the floor above on the ground floor next to the bedrooms and in front of my attic, my mother has never had any info on that and why it is sealed. I will try to post a photo.\n\nI had also recently my door of my garage unlocked and opened when she is always locked. My mom thinks she forgot to lock it but trust me, she never does. \n\nDuring this summer, a lot of stings were found death in front of the bed of my mother in her bedroom. It was not just one, it happened a lot of times but then it stopped. She was never stung by one of them, she just woke up and every day for a couple of days she found death stings. Doors, windows were locked and no holes in the wall. \n\nThe people leaving in this house before were an old couple but none of them died there.\n\nI also remember to have a cold wind in my shower on my body with a shiver when my door and window were locked and it happened a couple times and then one recently. \n\nI also had a dream with my teddy bear and I think he is haunted. So in my dream, I was in an old house (it was my house that I shared with my mom and my sister) and we decided to pack stuff to throw away. We went to the attic with my mom and they were toys (old dolls (porcelain, mid 1900's) and teddy bears) and I said to my mom Â«Â We'll sort them out and throw them awayÂ Â» and I was looking to the left and I saw a teddy bear and his head is turning towards me, I was scared and then all the toys jumped on me and my mother and I wake up terrified.\n\nThat's not the only thing I wanna share. have the same teddy bear that I had in my dream in real life. I saw it months ago in a store and I really liked him so I decided to buy it online from the same company. But even if I find him really cute, I always had bad vibes since I had him.\nFirstly, when I was on my computer and he was on my bed I always felt like something was watching me (I never had that feeling before even with my other dolls (because I have also dolls)) and I couldn't sleep with him in my bed so I was so scared that days later receiving him, I put him in my attic. So it is related that I got attacked in an attic by the same teddy bear in my dream ? The same teddy bear is currently in my actual attic so itâs almost like itâs a meaning. \n\nAlso wanna mention that the house in my dream have two identical rooms of my real house. The ground floor and living room.\n\nIf someone can help me with this and have any advices or anything else, I will love to hear from you.",

        "text": "So, letâs start with the least interesting part. Yesterday (Thursday), at around 19:00, I came home from a long day at work. It was already dark. After watching tv for an hour or 2 I started getting really tired, so I decided it was time to go to bed. When I entered my room, my eyes fell on my nightstand. There was an envelope there.\n\nNot just an ordinary envelope. It was a pitch black envelope with a white skull on it. I felt a shiver run down my spine. I live alone, so I am the only one that has the keys for this house. Also, the envelope certainly wasnât mine. I checked the house for any signs of burglary, but I couldn't find any. All windows and the backdoor were fully closed and locked. The front door had also been locked when I came home from work.\n\nI couldnât get my head around how this envelope ended up on my nightstand, but despite my confusion and fear, I needed to open it. So, I did. It was handwritten. This is what it said:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHello there. Do you remember all those times that you were scared when trying to fall asleep? Scared that something might crawl through your window in the middle of the night, or that you would suddenly hear a knock on your door which isnât coming from your parents? Or maybe you were scared that that thing under your bed might creep out, not realizing that that thing under your bed wouldn't bother to show itself, it would rather just grab your ankles and pull you under the bed so it can eat you alive.\n\nYour parents always said that you would be fine and that there was nothing to worry about. That was a lie. They forgot about me. Iâm that car you didnât see, the virus that almost killed you, even though you didnât notice a thing. Iâm that lightning bolt which almost took your plane down, that heart attack you narrowly escaped, that shadow in the corner of your room. Still, naive as you are, you believed your parents and so you tried to relax and eventually you started a botherless sleep, every time again.\n\nNow you probably think that Iâm kidding, because you're old enough to know that there is nothing under your bed, and that there will be no-one at your bedroom door tonight. Thatâs true, both things are not the case. I have much better and scarierer ways to enter your room. Iâve used a lot of different methods in the past years. Iâve been there hundreds of times. To watch you sleep, without you knowing that I was standing right there, at your sight. Watching your beautiful face when youâre fast asleep.\n\nIâve been chasing you. Iâve been so close plenty of times, without you noticing a single thing. Remember those moments when you were almost run over by a car? Those times when you frightenedly woke up, without knowing what happened? That was me, experimenting with my capabilities. Those were the moments I almost got you. I didnât want you dead then, I was just having fun. A year ago my feelings slowly started to shift. I decided that your time has come.\n\nI have been living up to this night for a long time. Thatâs why I sneaked up so many times into your room, to watch the person whoâs life Iâm going to end someday.\n\nYou might think this is all a yoke. You canât be further from the truth. I can promise you, there will be no tomorrow. Not for you. Youâve been on this earth for too damn long.\n\nSo, what am I?\n\nCall me your Doom. Iâve been chasing and playing with you for years on end. That time is over. Too often have I let you slip through my fingers. Not tonight, tonight I am coming for you, and this time I will get you.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI would love to wash it off as some sick prank or something like that. But how? There simply werenât any logical solutions for this. I donât believe in the supernatural. But if this was just someone trying to scare me, or someone who actually wanted me dead, how did they come into my house without leaving any trace? Also it wasnât written in any handwriting I recognized. Genuinely scared, I decided to call the police.\n\nâWhat theâ¦.â\n\nI had no service.\n\nI never, NEVER, had any problems with that.\n\nThen I realized something. The intruder might still be in the house. I always kept a pretty decent pocket knife in my nightstand. I thought this was the right moment to grab it. Luckily, it was still there. Shivering but determined, I checked the entire house again, with my knife in my hand. While I was searching in the living room, my phone buzzed. It scared the freak out of me. I checked and I saw I had a text. Hyped about having a signal again I opened it, ready to call the police immediately after.\n\nI froze.\n\n*âIâm not in the house, stop wasting your last hoursâ.*\n\nIn the bar where it should say the number it said âyour Doomâ.\n\nI checked my contacts to see if maybe âyour Doomâ has been added through a virus or something. There wasnât any contact going by that name, though. Also it still said I had no service. How had the message even arrived?\n\nI started sweating heavily. I took a deep breath and decided it would be best to just go to bed, and go to the police station tomorrow, when the sun was up again. I layed the knife under my pillow.\n\nAfter a long time of efforts to calm down, I finally entered a troubleless sleep.\n\nI awoke to a ticking sound. I froze, and listened. I thought it must be coming from one of the windows downstairs. I didnât dare to move. After a few minutes the sound suddenly stopped. For a while it was silent.\n\nThen, the ticking continued on my bedroom window. In a reflex I grabbed the knife from under my pillow. Not able to move any more, I stayed in bed, frightened to the bone, knife in my hands. Then the ticking also started again downstairs. In an uneven rhythm the ticking was now coming from two places.\n\nAfter around ten minutes I thought I was going to scream, when the ticking suddenly stopped.\n\nAfter that there was nothing to be heard for almost an hour. Not being able to get a second of sleep, I started getting hungry. With the fear now slowly wearing off, I headed downstairs, with my knife of course. I put on the lights in the kitchen and jumped backwards.\n\nAt the end of the kitchen, where there had been a counter and some windows, there was now something I couldnât describe differently than a black void, consisting of nothing but darkness.\n\nBefore I could think much about what on earth this was, something jumped out of it. It was a creature as black as night itself. It was shaped a little like a human, but it was something completely different. It had pointy claws and razor sharp fangs. On its back were big, black wings. It emerged with a deafening growl.\n\nA second later I was screaming on the ground with this beast on top of me. In a reflex I had pointed my knife forwards when it appeared. Now my knife was deep down in its chest, at about the place where its heart should be, if it even had one.\n\nIt was trying to move, but it seemed like the knife had hit its target at a critical spot. It couldnât do much more than wiggle. With all my force I rolled it to my side. Still screaming I jumped upwards.\n\nNot long after the creature stopped moving. I had killed it, whatever the heck it was. Horrified and still shaking vibrantly I tried to gather myself and pulled the knife out of its chest.\n\nWas I going insane? Or had a winged, black demon really just appeared out of a black void in my kitchen in the middle of the night? I almost started laughing. That changed when I realized the void was still there and this was actually very, very real.\n\nI was wondering if more would come. Preparing, I took the biggest and sharpest kitchen knife I had. I barely had it in my hand, when the answer came.\n\nI heard a howl. Like that of a wolf, but deeper and darker. The sound reverberated through my bones. Moments later a big, wolf-like creature appeared. It was white and grey and much bigger than a wolf should be. Its back was lined with ice blue spikes. Its eyes were pitchblack. It didnât jump at me right away. It just stood there, looking at me like it was disappointed I was still alive. Slowly it approached me, with a low, soft growl. It seemed to be careful because of my knife.\n\nI growled back at the wolf.\n\nYes.\n\nI growled.\n\nNot that the wolf seemed to care though.\n\nI was ready to move, expecting the wolf to jump at any moment.\n\nIt didnât. What it did was way beyond what I expected.\n\nIt opened its mouth, and a black thing shot out with a tremendous speed. I jumped away, and the thing scratched my shoulder. I looked around and saw a black dagger in the wall while I felt my shoulder getting wet with blood. Not even a second later I felt claws digging into my back and only then did I realize my mistake.\n\nI had turned my back to the wolf.\n\nI had been so shocked by a dagger shooting out of its freaking mouth that I turned my back on the creature.\n\nThe wolf had taken its change and was now on my back, probably ready to snap my neck. I started screaming.\n\nThen things started getting even weirder.\n\nI heard a loud thud. The wolf got off me, distracted by whatever hit it.\n\nI turned around and saw an arrow pointing out of the wolfs neck. A second later a dagger hit its neck, an inch under the place were the arrow was still stuck. The wolf growled in pain, whereafter it soon collapsed and stopped breathing.\n\nCompletely in shock, I looked to my left, just in time to see a blue portal-like thing disappear behind a man. Or at least, it looked like a man. It probably wasn't, but that's besides the point. It was wearing a green cloak with golden lines. In its right hand he held a big wooden bow. At his hip was a dagger.\n\nâNever turn your back on themâ, the man said.\n\nBaffled and completly confused I just looked at him, not saying a word.\n\nâAre you just going to keep staring at me like Iâm the killer, or are you going to get up? Thereâs more coming you knowâ.\n\nâMore?â I asked, not completely surprised but still very scared.\n\nâYes, thatâs what I said. Or do you think theyâll make it this easy for you?â.\n\nâEasy?â.\n\nâYes, easy. Are you going to repeat everything I say?â.\n\nâRight, sorryâ, I said. Trying to gather my wits. âWait, how did you get in here in the first place?â\n\nâNot the right questionâ, the man said. âDo you want to die?â.\n\nâN, noâ, I answered, feeling slightly threatened.\n\nâThen get the frick up and get yourself together!â, the man said, irritated.\n\nHastily I stood up. The man took his dagger and handed it to me. âIâm Blythe, take thisâ.\n\nâWhere are these things coming from?â I asked.\n\nWhile opening his cloak to take a big, elf-like sword, he said. âThat's a better question, but still irrelevant. Besides, you wouldn't believe me even if I told you. What *is* relevant however is that the thing that left the letter for you wants you dead. Now that we killed 2 of his most valuable servants it will be most likely that he gets here himself to do the job. Also, he didnât really expect me to show up here, so he'll be extra pissed off. He hates me, you know. Heâll probably take this chance to kill both of us himsâ.\n\nHe didnât have time to finish his sentence. A deafening roar emerged from the void. I stumbled backwards, moved by the shockwaves. The man didnât budge.\n\nSeconds later, a black cloaked creature in the form of a man appeared. Again, it probably wasn't a man, but it kinda looked like it so, yeah. It had no clear face or anything. Just darkness. I could barely make out its lines against the blackness of the void.\n\nBlythe seemed to easily see him though. Before I could blink he had shot an arrow at the man, who reached out and catched the arrow just before it hit him.\n\nHe freaking catched the arrow, mid-air, just like that. I know Iâve already seen enough supernatural things tonight, but still, I was baffled.\n\nThe black man threw the arrow back, with more precision and speed than I've ever seen an arrow being shot with. Blythe already had his sword in hand and sliced the arrow in two. 'At least I didnât need to doubt his experience', I thought.\n\nThe black man shot his hand forward and darkness shot towards Blythe, who dodged it while making a roll towards the man. He lashed out with his sword. The man dodged and gave Blythe a punch in the gut, who bent over in pain.\n\nAll this time I was just standing there. I knew I had to do something, but what? I didnât even know what that thing could do, or what it was for that matter. Both beings were completely distracted, so I tried to close in.\n\nAnother punch followed. Before it hit Blythe he moved his sword. It slashed against the dark figure's hand, who screamed in pain. He opened his other hand and darkness surrounded Blythe's face, leaving him blinded. He slashed with his sword to protect himself. The dark creature pulled a black sword out of nothing, and stuck it into Blythe. It wasnât a full hit, because Blytheâs sword blocked it partially, but he was in severe pain nevertheless and he fell to the ground.\n\nI was almost behind the dark man, ready to stab him with my dagger, but he turned too fast. He was facing me. I was terrified beyond my darkest imaginations. Looking into his eyes, or were his eyes must be, if he even had them, gave me the feeling I was already dead.\n\nHolding up my dagger, there wasnât much more I could do. Suddenly the creature moved its sword. It did it fast, I barely had time to register it. I still somehow managed to decently dodge it. It scraped against my belly.\n\nThen the being screamed. A second later a sword pierced trough its chest. Blythe was standing behind him. Seconds later, his sword turned into black powder and in shock he pulled his arm back.\n\nClearly in pain, but still alive, the dark creature turned and his hand shot towards Blytheâs gut. A black dagger was sticking out of Blythe's belly.\n\nI saw my chance.\n\nBefore Blythe fell to the ground, I lifted my dagger and slashed as hard and fast as I could, with all the strength I could muster. At the last moment, the creature started turning again, but it was too late. I chopped the head off.\n\nI literally chopped its head off.\n\nThe creatureâs headless body dropped to the ground, next to that of Blythe.\n\nI checked Blythe for a pulse, but he had none. He was gone.\n\nI sat on the ground. Totally exhausted and overwhelmed by all that had happened, I started crying. I had barely started however, before the bodies started to fade. Blythe, the dark man, the wolf and the winged creature. They all started to fade. Even the void started to slowly fade away, revealing my counter and kitchen windows, trough witch I could see that the sun had started to rise.\n\nAfter laying on the ground for a couple hours, crying and sleeping, I went upstairs. The envelope and letter had also faded away, and I had service again on my phone.\n\nItâs friday now, 15:08. This all happened last night. Iâm still extremely shocked and exhausted. It looks like it's all over now. I want to talk about it, but I donât dare to tell anyone, because who will take it for real?\n\nAll that's left are the wounds at my shoulder and belly. Even the dagger in the wall and Blythe's weapons had faded. I went to the hospital for my wounds , saying I had a fight. They didnât quite take it, but what should I have said?\n\nThis is the only place I feel like people will believe what happened to me, so, this is where Iâm posting.",

        "text": "A suburban lifestyle can get a little boring. Similar-looking houses. The tranquility of the streets seem to not be affected by anything other than an occasional car horn. Kids playing soccer in the front yard. But no binge drinking at two in the morning, going to a gala at an art gallery or clubbing at a discounted music venue. As a man in his early thirties, I reckoned it was time to settle down when I inherited a small house in the suburban area from my grandparents. I was not complaining. I was sick of living paycheck to paycheck unable to juggle between paying for rent or saving up. But this new life was also a little boring, to say the least. I was craving something interesting in my life. Some spark. That was it.\n\nThatâs when I noticed a young couple that recently moved in. Their house was right across from mine. They didnât seem anything out of ordinary. They kept it to themselves and did not seem to bother anyone else. To be fair, I barely interacted with any of them, which meant that I had no idea what they were really like. But they were young and it was rather rare to see homeowners so young in my neighborhood. I had millions of questions. What was their reason for staying here? What did they do for work? Did they have kids? I decided I would try befriending them if I could. Get to know more about my neighbors. That seemed to align with my idea of having a little spark in my life. Slow but steady. That was it.\n\nIt was a Friday evening. I walked over to their front porch. It was a standard house with standard decoration. There was a minimalistic mat in front of the door that read, âHave a Good Day.â Nothing out of the ordinary, as I said.\n\nI heard shuffling within the house. They must be organizing their new furniture or sweeping the floor, I thought nonchalantly. âHello, is anyone there?â I knocked on the door. A pause. There was silence. But it was a silence that felt a little strange to me. I did not hear a voice or anything. Not a âHey, can you go check the door?â Just an abrupt silence. It was as if whoever was inside paused what they were doing immediately and was waiting. Waiting for what?\n\nâI am your neighbor, Steve. I wanted to introduce myself.â I paused for a minute. I knew someone was in there. Something did not feel too right, but I internally laughed at myself. A lot of people make it seem like they are not at home when strangers come in front of their house. It was perfectly normal. I decided to count to ten and then leave when I heard the doorknob turn.\n\nâHi, Steve, nice to meet you.â A perfectly ordinary-looking man in his early 30s greeted me with a smile. He had a buzz cut that was a little too short and was wearing a pair of round glasses that was crooked on one end. He looked very calm as if there was nothing that happened beforehand and he merely stood up after sitting on a sofa. âMy name is also Steve. Howâs it going?â\n\nâWow, same name! Doing good. Just wanted to swing by and introduce myself. Itâs fairly rare to see someone so young move into this neighborhood.â\n\nâYes, yes that is true. That is true.â The neighbor smiled, but I was not sure if he wanted to continue on with this topic or not.\n\nâHey, I was wondering. Are you free tomorrow evening? I want to invite you two over for dinner at my place. I thought it would be fun. With some alcohol too.â I winked. I donât know why I winked but I guess I wanted to keep the mood a little lighthearted. It felt a little tense. The other Steve was staring at me. Staring at me very intently. He was so calm just a minute ago. What was he on about?\n\nâOf course, Steve.â the neighbor spoke. There was a pause of about ten seconds. I did not know whether to stare at him back or look at the ground.  âBut we donât want you to prepare all the food. How about a potluck? We will bring some food and we can all share. Do you have any dietary restrictions? Any meat that you avoid eating?â\n\nâI like all kinds of food, Steve. I would appreciate it.â\n\nâThatâs perfect.â The neighbor smiled, showing his perfectly white, pearly teeth. âWe will see you tomorrow. It was nice meeting you, Steve.â\n\nâSame goes for you.â\n\nI walked back to my house, unsure whether it was a good interaction or not. The other Steve was definitely polite, but there was something a little uncanny about him that he could not put a finger on. Maybe it was his stare. The intensity of it made it unreal. I shook my head. I was bothered by the smallest things. Meditation. Journaling. I needed to stop watching horror movies in my free time. Binging âGet Outâ the day before was definitely not a good idea.\n\nThat night, I was tumbling around the bed, unable to sleep. I was thinking about a lot of things. My career. My mundane life. Yadda yadda. But I was also thinking about the interaction I had with the other Steve just earlier. I was wondering to myself if it was the right decision to invite him over for dinner. I stood up and looked over the window. The neighborâs house was bright as if all the lights were turned on. I looked at the clock, it was three in the morning. All the other houses in the vicinity were dark as usual. Then, momentarily, all the lights turned off. Stillness. The night continued on.\n\nâWelcome, welcome. I prepared some pork chops with mashed potato and arugula salad.â I placed the dishes on the dinner table. Steve and his wife were at the front door. Steveâs wife looked like a typical woman in her early 30s. She was wearing a black overcoat with a red turtleneck underneath. Her slim hands were covered in white gloves that almost resembled surgical gloves. Fashion trends nowadays can be so subtle, I thought. She was not wearing any glasses, but her look was oddly similar to her husband's. They both looked like medical professionals but without the warmth of a family doctor.\n\nâYou can keep the shoes on. I donât mind.â\n\nThe couple smiled at me and entered the house.\n\nâHello, my name is Steve. Nice to meet you.â Instead of shaking my hand, the wife smiled again and nodded.\n\nâShe is a little quiet. Donât mind her. Here, we brought some food.â From a side bag, the other Steve took out three black, plastic containers. He laid them out on the dinner table, ever so gently to the point where I wondered if there was jewelry inside. Once they were on the table, the neighbor stood there quietlyâlooking at the containers with a smile indicating how proud he was. Proud of what?\n\nâDo you want to eat or have a glass of wine first? I have some vintage wine you might want to try. Here, take a look.â As I was walking to the wine cellar, I felt a gaze behind me. I looked back.\n\nâNo, thatâs fine. Letâs eat first. You must be famished,â the other Steve said.\n\nThe intensity of the neighborâs look felt like a dÃ©jÃ  vu. I nodded. âSure we can eat first.â\n\nâI will serve the food. I guarantee you have not had this before.â The neighbor looked at him with a big, warm smile. For the first time since meeting him, the neighbor seemed genuine. Kind even. I could feel the enthusiasm radiating from him. I smiled back, âSure thing.â\n\nThe wife walked to the dinner table, her boots not making a sound as she took her steps. When she arrived at the dinner table, she looked intently at the containers and immediatelyâyet slowlyâbegan to remove the lid, one by one. I was ready to be blown away. Gold-flaked steak? Foie gras? But what lay in front of me was rather a disappointment compared to my expectation.\n\nThe first dish was a brisket-type meat that seemed to have been slow-cooked for hours. The meat looked tender but seemed to have lost the shape of what it originally looked like. The second dish was some sort of stewed meat with raw onions on the side. The third dish was a sausage. A single piece of sausage that was boiled, not grilled. All in all, the food did not look too appetizing to me.\n\nâHere, try them. I guarantee you have not tried this meat before,â the other Steve repeated himself. I nodded awkwardly and sat down. I looked back at the neighbors. They were standing still, their eyes fixated on the brisket meat that was on my fork. I did not feel too great.\n\nâHey, you guys can sit down. Donât just stand there.â\n\nThe couple did not move an inch. They continued to stare at me. I took a bite.\n\nIt tasted like meat. There was not much flavor but was not bad either. But as I was chewing, I noticed the couple was standing closer and closer to me. Until they were right next to me, staring intently, passionately. Deathly.\n\nI thought they were looking at the meat but I was mistaken.\n\nThey were looking at me. But not at my face. They were looking into my body. My body. My flesh.\n\nThe meat suddenly tasted rancid. I spit them by reflex. The couple was still looking at me, but this time I swear they were glaring. Their faces did not move but their hands were shaking. Ever so slightly. So slightly.\n\nI did not know what came over me but I suddenly yelled out.\n\nâGet out. I donât want you here.â\n\nThe couple did not seem startled. They stood still.\n\nI ran towards the door. I swung the door open and pointed at the front porch.\n\nâGet the hell out of my house. Now.â\n\nThe couple looked at one another. Then, nodded. Slowly but gracefully, they put the lids on the containers, then placed them back in the side bag. They stared at me once. For long, excruciating fifteen seconds. Then, they began to walk. And walked out of the house.\n\nOnce I saw that they went back to their house, I ran into the washroom and brushed my teeth vigorously. My instinct told me what was in those containers was something no human was ever supposed to taste. I had no evidence to support any of this but I could not brush past the gut feeling that was enveloping me.\n\nThat whole night, I tumbled around, thoughts racing in my mind. Do I call the police about this? But where was the proof? I did not know what the right solution was, and I felt so alone. So alone.\n\nIn the midst of the night, I peered at the neighborâs house. It was dark tonight. Dark like any other house. This gave me a little comfort. That maybe I was just imagining things. That today was just an odd day.\n\nSuddenly, the lights flashed in the house. Blinking. Twice. Then darkness.\n\nThen silence.",

        "text": "I have a great deal of experience with hallucinogenic drugs, from the thousands of hits of LSD that Iâve taken to the pounds of psilocybin mushrooms that Iâve eaten. Iâve stopped time with a combination of nitrous oxide, ketamine and LSD, had mystical experiences where I heard angels and talked to God on combinations of LSD and mushrooms, smoked Salvia divinorum hundreds of times and even taken the bizarre mushroom Amanita muscaria, which got me caught in a seemingly eternal time-loop that I feel I barely escaped from. \n\nBut nothing compares to the new hallucinogenic drug sweeping through our town, which people simply called âVortexâ. The reason for its nickname will become apparent.\n\nMy first experience seeing someone on Vortex was when I was coming home from work and saw a naked homeless man in the middle of the street. I work the night shift in a rural area and often donât leave til 3 or 4 AM, so needless to say, this caught me by surprise. There is almost never anyone out on these streets at night. I almost hit him with my car.\n\nAlso, it was the middle of winter and freezing out. A combination of sleet and snow rained down from the sky, covering the naked man in a layer of icy condensation. But despite all this, he didnât seem cold at all. In fact, he was visibly sweating and sending off clouds of steam. His jaw moved rhythmically as if he were chewing on an imaginary wad of gum. As I got out, I saw his eyes staring through me, his pupils dilated so much they covered the entire iris in blackness. At first, I said nothing, just staring back at him blankly. Only the sound of sleet and ice hitting my car and the road broke the silence. \n\nâSir, are you OK?â I asked. He ignored my question, instead pointing directly behind me.\n\nâDo you see them?â he asked in a low quavering voice. I hesitated to turn around and leave myself open to potential attack from this potentially psychotic individual, but his clear anxiety and fear rapidly changed my mind.\n\nOn the side of the road, directly behind me, stood what appeared to be a doorway connected to nothing. Iridescent colors formed a kaleidoscopic tunnel that zoomed endlessly into the center, fractals connecting and dissipating every moment as I stared into this spiraling vortex. I could almost see through it, as if the doorway had the substantiality of a rainbow. But the beings stepping out of the other side of it looked entirely real and solid.\n\nThey had long antlers branching out from the top of their head, skull-like faces shaped like a deerâs with pieces of rotted skin and fur still attached haphazardly to their bones. Their ribs glistened under the snow and sleet, their claw-like talons extending far below their knees. Their skin, what remained of it, clung to their bones, reminding me of a survivor from a World War 2 death camp. The smell of rancid meat and rotting flesh rose from their bodies in clouds as they tramped towards us, towering at least ten feet tall. \n\nI didnât know what kind of nightmare these monsters had been ripped out of, but now that they were fully in our world, they seemed to smile, the bones of their faces twisting and rancid flesh ripping as they grinned down at me. I knew, at that moment, that I was dead. Even though I stood only five feet from the car, they were nearly as close and had much longer strides, as well as freakishly long arms that could reach out and pluck me up in an instant.\n\nAt that moment, the naked man screamed out, âThe manaha!â in a panicked voice, and tried to run past the three of them. They all turned to look at him in the same instant, their unnaturally long arms reaching out and picking him up off the ground as if he weighed as much as a feather. They started laughing a high-pitched psychotic laughter that echoed and reverberated throughout the surrounding woods, a sound so loud and all-consuming that I felt it vibrating through my heart and my ribcage. But my instinct kicked in and I knew I had only a slim opportunity to escape. I took it, running into my still-open driverâs side door and slamming it shut behind me as fast as I could. My car was still running, sending out clouds of exhaust behind me. I slammed the gear selector into drive. As I sent one last glance out in the direction of the homeless man, I saw them rending him limb from limb while he shrieked in agony. One of them pulled his arm off, separating it at the shoulder and lifting the severed arm over its mouth, letting the blood from the veins and arteries pour into its  skeletal mouth. The man was still alive as they ripped off his skin and sent their long, forked tongues into his open eyes and screaming mouth. \n\nThat was all I needed to see. I pounded my foot onto the accelerator and took off, the engine of the Ford Taurus revving loudly as the four-wheel drive cut through the slush and half-melted snow on the road. I heard a sharp scraping sound on the back of the car, likely one of the creatureâs claws, but I didnât look back to check. One of them had bounded over and tried to open the driverâs side door, running with the car as it accelerated, but luckily for me, my car automatically locked the doors once you began driving. The monster let go and smashed in the back window with its massive, bony fist, but then I lost them in a matter of seconds as I sped away.\n\nâWhat the fuck what the fuck what the fuck,â I said to myself, a vulgar mantra that nonetheless made me feel more grounded. My mind cleared as the adrenaline rush began to wane, leaving me feeling used-up and exhausted. I went around a sharp turn and, to my great relief, couldnât even see the creatures in the rearview mirror any longer. Taking a deep breath, I centered myself, reaching into my pocket for my phone and dialing 911.\n\nâ911, whatâs your current location please?â a young female operator said on the other end of the line. Between trembling breaths, I told her.\n\nâClearview Lane, at the townline of Unity and Fredericksburg,â I said quickly, my voice trembling. âThere is a man, dead, on the side of the road. I think he was attacked byâ¦â What did I say exactly? Certainly not the truth. No one would believe me unless they saw it for themselves. â...grizzly bears,â I finished quietly.\n\nMy service began to cut out then, and I could only make out every other word she said. âHelpâ¦ wayâ¦â I heard her say before the call dropped completely. The service was always spotty out here on these rural mountain roads. I drove down a steep mountain pass towards the main valley where downtown lay. On the way, a scenic overlook had picnic tables; all the trees that obstructed the view were cut down. Looking over, I had a sudden view of the downtown area of Fredericksburg, and I saw fires rising up from the buildings in a towering inferno. \n\nI could smell the smoke through my car vents even up here, a smell like charred wood, burning metal and thick smoke. The trees then blocked the view of the town again, but within a couple minutes I was driving into the center of it. This was, after all, the only road that led to the house I rented on the far edge of Fredericksburg.\n\nFlashing lights from emergency vehicles reflected blinding pulses of red and blue throughout the dark mountainous forests. Something landed heavily on top of my car, and a massive clawed hand reached down and smashed my windshield. I started swerving wildly, barely missing a tree on the edge of the road. A dirt driveway was approaching on the left and I turned sharply, sending the beast on top of my car flying off. \n\nIt looked like some kind of hybrid between a gargoyle and a Komodo dragon. It had green skin that glowed in the dark, illuminating the nearby trees in deep viridescent hues. Its winged absolutely dwarfed the center mass of the being, spreading out in each direction twenty feet. It flapped them languidly, landing softly on the dirt driveway and staring at me with a look of abject fury. It opened its huge mouth and sent out a shriek that sounded like a woman being burned at the stake- loud, piercing and seemingly never-ending. My carâs headlights were facing it head-on now and I slammed the accelerator down. The beast jumped up but not fast enough. My tires pinned its left wing down as it furiously beat them, trying to rise in the air. Unable to escape, it fell beneath the tires of my car, a sickening crack resonating throughout the valley as I ran over its spine and chest.\n\nI heard rending sounds as its claws and mouth tore at the underside of my carriage and the tires. The car quickly stopped working as I drove it forward another few feet, the tires rapidly losing all pressure as steam began to pour out of the engine. My heart was beating fast and I felt on the verge of a breakdown. More shrieks from across the valley answered the dying cry of the beast as it let out one final defeated scream, then fell silent.\n\nI turned the car off, and all I could hear was the ticking of the engine block and the soft patter of sleet against the top of the car. Then I heard something else, something that made my heart soar with hope- the sound of a human voice.\n\nâHey, you, in the Taurus,â someone said nearby. I looked down the dirt driveway and saw a person waving their arms furiously in front of a one-story blue and white house. I opened the car door, looking down at the flying lizard suspiciously. I had heard many stories of rabid animals who people thought were dead, before they picked them up and the animal came back to life and bit them. Or some species of animals would even play dead as a defense mechanism against predators. I carefully tapped the edge of the wing with my steel-toe shoes, then stomped on it as hard as I could. The creature did not stir, which I took as a signal that it was truly dead.\n\nI jumped out of the car and began to jog towards the house. I did not want to stay out in the open for longer than I had to. As I neared the front porch, I realized the person who had called me was actually an old man, who looked like he was in his eighties or nineties. Tiny wisps of hair grew out of his hawk-like nose and large ears, and his face was a labyrinth of wrinkles and creases. He smiled at me, revealing two full sets of steel dentures that shone under the dim porch lights. I towered over him, and he was hunched over which further diminished his height.\n\nOn his head, he wore a fishing cap made of khaki. It looked large on him, and jostled slightly as he moved. A large black pin with white font stuck to the front of the fishing cap read, âHope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man.â\n\nâDonât dilly-dally,â he said gruffly, looking me up and down. âYou know as well as I do what lurks out here. Get inside, get inside.â He made hand gestures like he was swatting at me, and I went through the door into the house. He slammed it shut behind us, engaging a deadbolt and locking the doorknob. \n\nThe house smelled of vanilla candles, fresh-baked bread and, behind that, a musty and dusty odor that older homes seem to get. It had knick knacks on every shelf in the hall to the foyer. The man pushed by me, leading me to a living room lined with bookshelves, thousands of leather-clad hardcover books lining the walls on every side. I noticed he had no TV in here. He motioned for me to sit down on the couch and sat next to me on the recliner. Then he started talking.\n\nâMy name is Canton,â he said slowly, making eye contact with me the whole time. âAnd yourâs?â\n\nâIâm Ryan,â I said. âRyan Kellarman.â He nodded gravely at this, which almost made me burst out laughing, as it seemed so incongruous to the piddling details we had just revealed. But I contained my mirth inside myself. Perhaps the shock of the day was just finally getting to me.\n\nâLook, Ryan,â he said, âwe have a situation.â His steel teeth shone even brighter in the fluorescent lights as he talked. \n\nâYes,â I said, âI saw a man get murdered by something earlier. And there seem to be more of those âsomethingsâ all over the place.â\n\nâItâs the drug,â Canton said abruptly. âThis Vortex crap. I donât know who discovered it, but someone thought it would be fun to use our town as the guinea pigs and mix it in with the illegal drug supply here. This may surprise you, but I am ex-FBI. I also spent decades working with black ops in the US government. The Governor has called in an agency that most people donât even realize exists. They usually call themselves the Psychic Research Agency or the PRA. \n\nâWhile the name might not sound intimidating, they are ruthless killers, torturers and psychopaths of the highest degree. Through my lifelong connections, I was warned that the federal government had surrounded this town, quarantining us from the rest of the country, and they will soon be sending in their goons to execute every single last one of us and all the creatures as well. No one can be left alive who saw the powers of Vortex or what it can bring to our world.â\n\nâSo weâre all dead, huh?â I asked, feeling dissociated and oddly calm under the circumstances. Outside the house I could hear sirens, people screaming in the distance, and other sounds that were not human.\n\nâNot exactly,â he said, a small smirk crossing his old, weathered face. âI put millions of doses of Vortex in the water supply for the town.â I gasped, rising from my chair.\n\nâYou?! Youâre the reason everything is going to hell outside?â I screamed. He motioned for me to sit down, calmly waiting for me to stop yelling. It just made me angrier.\n\nâNo, the drug was already here in isolated cases and the government had already made the call to kill us all when I acted. I found the source and did what I had to do. You have to understand, the agents were already on their way, and the death warrants for every man, woman and child in the town were signed by the President himself. \n\nâBut if everyone is exposed to the drug, then it will open countless portals to other parts of the multiverse, let in many other beings who can fight those federal agents. Those beings are our only chance. They can kill the executioners that have already surrounded the town and allow at least some of us to escape.â I sighed, sitting back down.\n\nâIf I even believe what youâve said,â I began, âand Iâm not sure I do, how do you propose that we get out of this town? We canât exactly just walk through the woods with countless monsters infesting the entire area.â His face fell, his expression turning to a frown.\n\nâHonestly, I havenât gotten that far yet in my planning. I did the only thing possible, at least in my mind, but we just have to try to escape in the chaos and take as many innocent people with us as possible. The monsters will begin attacking the lines of agents surrounding the town soon, if they havenât already, and that will open up weak points where we can break through. I have plenty of guns here and a working car, and-â he reached underneath his recliner, pulling out a plastic bag, âI have millions more doses of Vortex.â He shook the bag, and I saw purple crystals inside sending off sparks of iridescent light as he did so. âThis drug is active in doses of millionths of a gram, and begins to work within seconds. It has 100% bioavailability even when absorbed through the skin. We may be able to figure out a way to drug the agents with it, if everything else fails.â\n\nAt that moment, we begin to hear gunshots directly outside of the house. A bullhorn was turned on, emitting a loud mechanical shriek for a moment before a voice began to speak.\n\nâYou are surrounded,â a deep voice said. âCome out with your hands raised and we will not harm you. You are under quarantine. I repeat, your house is surrounded. Come out now and surrender.â\n\nâOh God,â Canton said, putting his face in his hands, âitâs too late.â But then he looked up, his expression brightening. âUnlessâ¦â\n\nâUnless what?â I asked, feeling sweaty and trapped in the house. I knew we didnât have much time before they broke down the door, and if what he said was true, they would just fill us up with bullets on the spot.\n\nâOur only chance,â Canton said, âis the drug. We have to both take it and open the doorway, let something in that might be able to fight and kill those agents outside. We certainly canât take them with my guns, just two of us and no body armor. My rifles arenât even fully automatic and theirs are. It really is our only hope.â I sighed deeply, a rising sense of trepidation increasing my anxiety. I did not want to take this drug, didnât even want to be near it. I had seen the kind of horrors it could unleash.\n\nâAlright,â I said, before I could let my fear stop me. âLetâs do this now, before I lose my courage.â He nodded, getting up and rummaging through a nearby desk, pulling out two bright blue pills. He gave one to me and kept one for himself. \n\nâSame time,â he said. âJust chew it and keep it in your mouth. We donât have time to wait for the capsule lining to dissolve. Ready?â I nodded, and we both popped the capsules in our mouth, chewing them as fast as we could. I could hear the agents moving around outside, getting closer. It sounded like there were dozens of people out there.\n\nâLast chance,â said the man with the bullhorn. âCome out withâ¦â and then his voice deepened and slowed and I couldnât understand it anymore. It sounded like the calls of a blue whale in the ocean, but even deeper than that. Time slowed to a crawl. I looked out the window and saw a water droplet falling. It fell at a snailâs pace, seeming to hang suspended in the air by some magical force.\n\nMy heart tightened in my chest, and I felt overwhelming waves of fear. I remembered all the worst parts of my life- finding my brotherâs dead body after a heroin overdose, seeing my mother dying of cancer, having to bury my catâs mangled body after she was attacked by a neighborâs dog and had her throat ripped out. It was like it was all there in front of me every time I blinked, another image of terror and sadness, like the drug was trying to break me.\n\nI closed my eyes and breathed deep, trying to calm myself, using techniques for Buddhist meditation I had learned. I recited a mantra and began to focus on my breathing, imagining pure white light spreading from my heart to the rest of my body. While it didnât fully break the terror, it did help a great deal. When I opened them again, I saw Cantor also had an expression of fear on his face, his bright blue eyes looking frantically around the room as rainbows began to shimmer behind him.\n\nTwo doorways materialized at the same time, both standing nearly as tall as the room itself. I stared into the kaleidoscopic tunnel in the center as I heard the front door crashing in, the sound of heavy boots entering the house. We had almost run out of time.\n\nFrom one of the portals stepped monsters from some alien world. They were about the size of German shepherds and even walked on all fours, but there the resemblance to canines ended. Their skin looked like burning lava, and their eyes were just empty sockets with flames dancing within the empty orbs. Their mouths hung open, revealing hundreds of sharpened obsidian teeth the size of needles on the top and bottom. There were four of them and they seemed to travel as a pack. They regarded us with rage, looking like they were about to spring and tear both of our throats out. \n\nLuckily at that moment, an agent ran in with his gun raised at us, his finger on the trigger, and the creatures immediately turned and pounced on him instead. He screamed as their paws burned through his SWAT gear and into his flesh, a smell like roasting pork mixed with burning cloth filling the living room. I took the chance to grab Cantonâs hand and try to pull him away from the direction of the front door.\n\nâWe have to go now!â I whisper-shouted at him. And then I saw what was coming through the other portal.\n\nIt reminded me of the Hindu god Shiva. It looked like a human being with blue skin who stood ten feet tall, had four arms and a loincloth of some alien leather material covering his waist. In his top right arm he held a silver trident, the other arms all holding daggers or swords. His eyes looked like pure white lights emanating from his face as he stared directly at me, and I knew without question that I had been the one who summoned this being.\n\nDozens more federal agents rushed into the room, their guns raised, but they werenât even looking at us anymore. They all began shooting in unison at the alien-dogs and the four-armed being. The dogs leapt at the agents, their molten skin melting the agentsâ guns and bodies as they ripped out the agentsâ throats with their obsidian teeth. Spurts of blood began to soak the hardwood floors as men began to scream and die all around us. The smell of copper and iron began to drift through the entire area as droplets of blood flew in all directions.\n\nâLetâs go,â I said to Canton, grabbing his arm and heading towards the kitchen. There was no door in there but I opened a large window, shoving the old man through before jumping out myself. Shrieks of pain and more gunshots followed us out into the night.\n\nI used my cellphone as a light as we traversed across the forest. There were signs of a perimeter being formed, but the dead bodies of men and women in black SWAT gear all around us showed it had not held against the many monsters released in the town of Fredericksburg this night. Some of the agents out here on the edge of town had been beheaded, others were skinned alive. A few were crucified on lampposts, most of their clothes ripped off and deep gashes covering their entire bodies. I saw men whose penises had been cut off and stuffed into their mouths, women whose eyes had been ripped out and replaced with coins, and much worse things that I try not to remember.\n\nEventually we made it into a nearby town, grabbing food from a diner as I wrote all this down. I thought it was over. I *hoped* it was over. I didnât want to think of this night ever again.\n\nHowever, someone just sent me a picture on my cellphone. It looks like a blue-skinned, four-armed god dancing on the bodies of dozens of black-clad men in SWAT gear.",

        "text": "Full disclosure, I was an anti-masker during Covid. No, it wasnât because they infringed on âmuh freedomsâ or that I found it hard to breath. It was just that masks made my assignment at the time ratherâ¦ difficult. \n\nIâm a mercenary, a gun for hire. I contract out through a shadowy outfit based in D.C. Up until 2020, my jobs had all been sandyâThe Sahel, Somalia, Afghanistan. Poor places where the big governments like to play war. My jobs were the dirtiest of the dirty work. I did missions that militaries wanted to be able to distance themselves from if something went wrong. \n\nIt was only a matter of time before I got a fucked-up contract like I did in Romania. A memo came in from Bucharest asking for a dozen American contractors with combat experience. I didnât ask questions. The paycheck was enormous for what seemed like a cakewalk compared to keeping up the Westâs âwar of terrorâ Or shitâ¦ I mean *ON* terror. Yeah, thatâs it, War on Terror. \n\nAll twelve of us were given different arrival dates. When I landed in Romania, six soldiers from America were already there and I suspected Iâd be meeting up with them, but none of my suspicions turned out right. \n\nUpon landing I was put into a taxi hired by the government and after several hours without so much as a pee-break Iâm stepping out of the car all groggy with my black duffels and rifle crate. \n\nA swath of great forest runs through Romania following the Carpathian Mountains like a backwards L. I was now near the head of that L, by the Ukrainian border. \n\nI could hardly believe my surroundings when I got there. I was expecting to join a tactical team for a briefing, what I found was a thatched roof shelter. It was wall-less, little more than a structure to give travelers shelter from the rain for a night. \n\nThe shelter was stationed at the edge of the forest. It was some kind of checkpoint or resting point before you ventured any further into the woods. \n\nThere was a single trail that snaked through the dark spruces behind it and disappeared deep into the forest. Something was off about this assignment, but I my mind didnât linger on what. \n\nI stopped and breathed. The fragrance of the coniferous trees was a balm after six hours of smelling my cabbies Camels. \n\nBut he himself wasted no time getting away from fresh air. The taxi driver slammed his door and sped off without a goodbye. A spatter of mud slapped onto me as the little car puttered away. \n\nI flicked a few globs of mud off my sleeves as I went to the shelter. There, an old man tended a fire, cross-legged, while two gray-muzzled sheep dogs rested their chins on his legs. \n\nI did not speak Romanian. I reviewed the emailed instructions I received. All they said was speak to Boian once I arrived at the destination. I knew I wasnât being played. My contractor has a system to verify all communications. It was confirmed that the Romanian government had wanted me here, but why? \n\nâBoian?â I asked and waited for an answer. The old man nodded. \n\nâSit, please.â \n\nHe gestured at a dry spot of dirt across the fire. I moved my bags in under the shelter and sat. âIâm not sure Iâm in the right place.â\n\nâOh, you are.â \n\nâWhere are the other soldiers?â \n\nâIt is just you and me.â \n\nI laughed and shook my head. âAnd whatâs our objective? I take it thereâs a terrorist outpost in these woods?â I pointed at the trees. âOr are we after wolves attacking a Shepardâs herd?â\n\nThe old man just stared at me until I blushed and looked away. His expression was a quiet condemnation of my arrogance. When his silence had properly highlighted the stupidity of my last sentence, he spoke. \n\nâThere are many tribes in these woods. They choose to live a lifeâ¦unspoiled. They cut wood, carry water, catch fish. They shunned the cities to live in the woods.â He broke a few sticks in half and fed them to the fire. \n\nThe dogs watched the new kindling crackle and burn before gently closing their eyes again. \n\nâIt wasnât always like that. One tribe was so cruel. So cunning. They were the Paraziti. Parasites. They took what other tribes had instead of making things of their own. They had no fisherman, no smiths, no weavers. Only killers. This tribeâ¦ they adapted to kill and feed on humans. They grew fangs.â I nodded my head up knowing where this was going. âItâs wasnât Vlad the Impaler but these sick beings that began the legends of Dracula.â \n\nâI see,â I said, skeptically.\n\nâWell, you will come to. Eventually, when nearly every tribe was wiped out, the Paraziti vanished. Some say the devil took them to be his demons. Others say that they crawled into the earth to hibernate until more people populated these woods so they could kill once more. But the truth of where they wentâ¦ it doesnât matter. What does matter is that theyâre back.â \n\nI stayed quiet for a moment, expecting him to laugh at my stoic expression, to say he was fucking with me and that there was actually a terrorist cell hiding out in the caves. But instead, he kicked dirt on the fire and the dogs shot up and shook themselves off. \n\nâCome. We have several miles to travel before we sleep. Take only what equipment you need. Rifle, ammo. Donât worry about food, I have plenty.â \n\nHe started off down the trail while I stayed sitting. I thought about walking to the nearest village and buying a ride back to the airport. This was ridiculous, but who was I to complain? After all, I was getting paid the same. \n\nI assembled my rifle, slung it over my shoulder and left the plastic case behind. \n\nIn the next few weeks, I learned the world was a much bigger place than I ever imagined. There were full-blown cities in these woods, each ringed with walls of spruces that had been sharpened to spikes and teeming with hundreds of inhabitants. They made their own clothes, soap, and cookware. It was like I had stumbled through a portal to the medieval ages. \n\nI stayed with Boian off one of the main roads that connected the villages. He had a hut there, and I learned that his job was to act as a kind of highway patrol. He taxed trade between villages and made sure bandits werenât raiding the roads. \n\nBut there was hardly any trade or traffic between villages when I started. The air was quiet with fear. Apparently, a family homestead had been attacked a month back. Holes were found on their necks, draining their bodies dry. The whispering and the rumors swirled that they were the Paraziti, but none of the attackers were seen. \n\nWith so much wilderness patrolling one road felt useless, but Boian said the legends were true and in order for the Paraziti to reach a village they must be invited inside. They canât just sneak there through the woods. \n\nTo be honest, the assignment didnât have my full attention. It felt like a joke. The other 11 contractors that were hired had the same job as me, they were assisting other patrols between villages. Boian *did* have a radio and no unusual activity had been reported by any on the sentries on the road. Until one by one, they went dark. \n\nIt started further down the mountain range, first it was the outpost near the Serbian border. Then the woods of central Romania went quiet. It was making its way towards us. We used to get a wagon or two a day coming from the south, but all travel suddenly ceased. \n\nWhen the village caught word that communication with the south was gone, I thought theyâd flee to the cities. Instead, they nailed closed their shutters, barred their doors as soon as it was dusk, and loaded their rifles. It felt like something was coming. \n\nOne day when Boian and I were watching the road, a rickety wagon approached pulled by a pair of mules, their ribs bulging against their fur. \n\nBoian and I looked at one another and I shouldered my rifle, stepping out into the muddy road. \n\nWith not much else to do, I had dived into learning Romanian my first few weeks here. While I couldnât much speak it or read it, I could understand the gist of Boianâs conversations at this point. \n\nHe did most of the talking while I stood tall and menacing with the rifle across my chest. \n\nThe protocol for our road patrol was simple: Check the teeth of all persons to make sure they didnât have fangs and second, make sure there are no stowaways in the cargo. This sometimes meant going through sacks of wool or piles of potatoes but so far, we hadnât turned up anything. \n\nThe driver wore a mask and stopped the mules. The beasts stood dumbly in the road, blinking lazily. \n\nâWhat is your business on these roads?â asked Boian.\n\nI looked at the wagon. There were four women in the back, wrapped tight in coats. Their shawls covered their faces. \n\nâWe are fleeing before the storm in the south can reach us.â\n\nBoian walked closer and I followed. âWhat do you know about whatâs happening in the south?â \n\nâSomething is coming. We intend to cross the border and stay in the wilderness until this evil has passed.â \n\nâWell, you can go no further without inspection.â \n\nâAs we expected.â \n\nBoian gestured for me to go to the back of the wagon. The women all wore masks, too. This was 2020, and Covid was taken seriously here. The people knew if there was an outbreak in any of these remote villages there would be hardly anything town doctors could do and many would die. \n\nâTeeth,â I said and held my mouth open in a smile with my pointer fingers. One by one, the women pulled the heavy shawls up over their eyes and showed me their upper teeth. But even before I looked for fangs, something about their movement bugged me. \n\nThey moved rigidly. Robotically, like there was something wrong with their arms. \n\nThe women held their mouths open funny, too. Their lips were pushed and curled up so I could see. They didnât smile like you would for a dentist, but there were no fangs. \n\nThe last two women who showed me their mouths had fresh blood running from their gums. I indicated that they could let their masks down and walked over the Boian. \n\nI pushed him back a few steps so we were out of earshot of the driver and whispered in his ear. âNo fangs but something seems off. Some of the women, their gums are bleeding.â \n\nâThat is not uncommon, especially when travelers know weâre checking teeth. They brush them hard to be polite. But I agree they are strange, but they donât look like Paraziti. Their teeth, they are real.â \n\nâBut what ifâ¦ what if they stole regular peopleâs teeth.â \n\nBoian gave me a funny look. âDid it look like that to you?â \n\nI thought back and to be honest it didnât. Their teeth hadnât been replaced and if they had, the Paraziti were phenomenal dentists. âNo,â I said. \n\nâMay we go to the village?â asked the driver.\n\nBoian and I looked to each other. We were both on edge, if it werenât for our anxiety it was possible we mightâve found nothing out of the ordinary with this inspection to begin with. \n\nBoian waved them on. âYou may go. Safe travels.â\n\nThe driver raised one arm in farewell and Boian and I both watched him with skeptical squints. There it was again, that strange robotic movement. \n\nWe stood in the road while the mules plodded on, listening to the cart moan and creak until they were up the hill and out of sight. \n\nThat night, Boian and I ate supper in silence. I was getting paid weekly so there was no completion clause for my contract. I remember I was thinking about leaving that very night when Boian and I looked up at the same time.\n\nThere was a sound on the wind. A wailing. We burst outside of his hut where the noise was clear. The nearest village was almost three miles up the road, but we heard the screams clear as day. \n\nI started gathering my things and Boian was already sprinting. As we got closer, we smelled smoke and could see the orange glow of flames flicker in the sky. In the time it took to get there the screams had ceased. \n\nThe gate to the village was left wide open, invitingly. Boian and I slowed and walked silently the rest of the way. The village still made noiseâthe fire leaping hut to hut was crackling, whistling and roaring. \n\nWe got to the mouth of the gate and I froze. My combat experience didnât prepare for this terror. Thereâs speed to a firefight, a forgetfulness of fear. But this had me shaking like a child. \n\nThere, inside just the gate, were the bodies of the coach that had passed by hours earlier. The man and the four women. \n\nBoian bent and turned one of them over and we both jumped back at how easily the corpse moved. It was weightless. I set my rifle barrel against the chest of one and prodded with it. \n\nThe entire chest was empty. No organs, no bones. It was like that for all of them. Their legs and arms were hollow tubes. And their headsâ¦ theyâd been cut in two and stitched back together. \n\nâThe Paraziti,â I said aloud. âThey massacred them when they got to the village. They were already here, waiting for more people to come.â\n\nâNo,â said Boian stepping backwards. âNo,â he started to sprint away into the woods. âTrojan horse!â he shouted back at me. \n\nâHey, wait!â But I stayed still, realizing what he meant.\n\nIt was why their movements were so mechanical earlier.\n\nIt was why some of their gums leaked blood. \n\nThe Paraziti had emptied these humans out. Spooned out every last ounce of flesh and stuffed themselves inside. \n\nâOhâ¦ fuck. Oh fuck.â I said while beginning to follow Boian. \n\nYou see, it was our fault. \n\nWe were the ones that had [let them in.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)",

        "text": "They are after me. I don't know exactly what *they* are, but I can tell you this: If they catch me, I am a goner.  My only hope is that if they do catch me, that its over quick. I can't go out like Carl did.  Carl had it really bad.  I don't want to tell you exactly what they did to him, but I can assure you; it's the stuff nightmares are made of.\n\nI should have paid that bill. It was only a few hundred dollars, and I could have afforded it.  But I just had to buy more streaming services, pizzas, and Chinese takeout (tipping your delivery person isn't cheap you know).  I wish I would have just budgeted better and paid that damned bill.\n\nPoor Carl, poor him.  He was a good man Carl was. He would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it (expect for his *Goonies* shirt, he loved that thing).  Now, his apartment is empty all except for that parrot of his.  Poor thing has probably plucked all its feathers out by now.  I want to go over and get Joe, but I can't risk it.  They will be watching.  Joe is such a loveable bird, a beautiful quaker parrot that Carl bought off a homeless guy down by the beach when we were in 8th grade.  That was years ago.\n\nJoe gets fed and all, he won't die (I hope).  I have been paying the landlord to go in and feed Joe, clean his cage, etc. I hope he is doing a good job.  He is a testy cuss that old Mr. Garbolsinski.  Yea, he is a tough character.  He came over from Poland during the height of the cold war.  The man came with the clothes on his back and now he is a wealthy property owner by day and polka band lead by night.\n\nI shaved my head and have been wearing a fake beard, I hope the disguise works. I am pretty good about making sure that I am not being followed. I watched some cool podcasts that talk all about counter surveillance.  I use the internet at a cafe and a VPN.  They won't find me using their fancy SIGNIT.  Still though, I think if I would have just paid that bill.\n\nIt all started when Carl got a coupon in the mail.  It was for a new Pizza joint that neither of us had ever heard of.  I came over to his pad one night after a long, back breaking, day of doing nothing at work. We planned on playing video games, drinking *Mountain Dew* and eating pizza all damned night.  \"Holy smoked Carl!\" I said as I entered his apartment. The smell was amazing.\n\nOn the table before me were stacks of pizzas. Pepperoni, Hawaiian, mushroom and onion, veggie lovers, he had it all. The boxes where different.  On the top was a golden hand surrounded by a black circle.  Above the image in red letters read: Golden Hand Pizza.  We pigged out to say the least. It was some of the best pizza I had ever eaten, but boy did I regret it later.  I shit something fierce the next day.\n\nThe next morning, after a bender of pepperoni, soda, and video games I was awoke by the sound of Joe chirping.  Carl was sitting in front of the tv watching his favorite movie, *The Goonies.* \"...Pizza...Pepperoni.\" \"Shut up Chunk!\" *oh I love this part*. I thought to myself.  \"So, Carl, how did you afford all that pizza last night?\" I asked, sitting up from the couch that had been my bed for the night.  Carl turned around with a slice of pepperoni and jalapeÃ±o in his hand. \"Oh, that's right, I never told you.\"\n\nCarl filled me in on the whole thing.  He had got an advertisement in the mail and had to sign up for a special one-time offer. \"All the pizza you can eat for only $10.99 a month! Jokes on them, I'll eat them out of business.\" Carl said, face stuffed like a chipmunk.  I had to get in on the action.  I ended up signing up right then and there also.  I got out my phone and created an account. \"Oh, there is just one more thing.\" Carl added.\n\nTurns out, they have to interview you, it's like a background check. \"Yea, they strap you down in this chair and hook you up with these wires, it's pretty cool...\" Carl said. *Whatever man, as long as iam getting these pizzas, I could give a fuck.*\n\nThey came the next night.  I had just laid down to go to bed when the doorbell rang.  \"Mr. Hugh Racion?\" A voice came from the door.  \"Mr. Hugh G. Racion?\"  I couldn't help but laugh.  I gave a false name. *Huge erection.* \"Be right with you!\" I replied.\n\nThe interview was easy.  It was two men.  One was short and portly; the other was tall and lanky.  They looked normal enough.  The had pins on their lapels. *Order of the Golden Hand, pretty official looking* I thought as I sat strapped in the chair the one of the men had brought. \"So, what's the deal gents? Going to ask me my deepest darkest secrets?\" The said nothing.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity strapped to the metal chair, they took the wires off my head and produced an official looking document. \"Just formalities.\" The taller gentleman said. \"Sing here, here, and here.\" The portly gentleman produced a pen and I signed.  \"Congratulations Mr. Racion, here is your member card and remember, your dues are due on the 15th of *every month*\" The fat one said with a grin.\n\nThe next weeks where pure bliss.  I must have gained ten pounds with all the pizza I consumed.  After a while, I got sick of eating pizza and started ordering Chinese again.  The weeks turned into months, and I forgot the whole thing. *Mistake number one*\n\nCarl came over one night, wrapped in a cast from head to toe. \"Carl, what happened to you!?\" Oh nothing, just forgot to pay my dues. *What dues?* \"You owe a bookie money or something, geez Carl, you look like shit.\" I said, putting down my controller and looking at my friend who now looked luck an Egyptian Mummy from some cheesy old horror film. Then it hit me. *What was today's date?*\n\nIt was the 16th of January 2023. *Late!* My heart raced as I picked up the phone, trying to login to my account with Golden Hand Pizza.  \"Sorry, your account has been disabled.\"  The sight read. Then I heard a knock at the door.\n\nThey came in, first the tall one, then the little one straggling behind him.  They took away Carl first, oh poor Carl.  *Why didn't you pay two months in a row?* It was quick, but it was not painless.  They capped me in the knees with a baseball bat.  I am not sure if it was the tall one or the short fat one, but it hurt so bad.  Now I walk with a limp.  Carl had it much worse.  I won't go into it. It's too much to relive.\n\n\"Why, oh, why did you not pay your dues Mr. Racion?\" The tall one said as I lay on the floor crying in pain. \"Next time you will be like your little friend *Mouth* over here!\"  *Who the fuck is Mouth?* I remembered; it was Carl' favorite character from his favorite movie.   I was in trouble now.\n\nIt's been a little over a week since the Order of the Golden Hand came a calling.  I hope they don't find me.  I have been hiding out. Time will tell.  For now, my heart weeps for my friend, all that is left of him is the tattered *Goonies* shirt he loved so much...and his bird, Joe.  Wish me luck and whatever you do, don't sign up for anything that seems too good to be true, especially if its pizza.",

        "text": "Â Â I squeal in joy as I grab the doll not hearing my mother's protest. \"Who do you think left it here?\" I ask my mom.Â \n\n\nÂ Â My mom holds her head as she thinks then shrugs her head, \"maybe they knew it was your birthday so someone rang the doorbell and dropped it to surprise you?\" I look at her with a happy expression. I hug her and then quickly ran upstairs to check out my knew doll.Â \n\n\nÂ Â It looks like a Raggity Anne doll. With long braided hair and wearing a blue blouse. In her blue blouse I noticed that the doll has a pocket in it. I looked in it and saw that the doll has a pen and a notepad. I look at the notepad and on the first page it said:\n\n\nÂ Â Hello! My name is Suzie! What's your name?Â \n\n\nÂ Â Now I thought that this was just a way of saying what the doll was. On the other hand though I also thought it would be fun to play a little game with it.\n\n\nÂ Â My name is Mary! I'm 15 and I like to write and draw! I hope we can be friends!\n\n\nÂ Â I look at my little handwritten note at the bottom of the original message. I just thought it was a bit funny since it came with the notepad. I then grabbed my phone out of my pocket and messaged Beth and Amy about my new doll.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I then went downstairs and asked my mom if I can go have a sleepover at Amy's and she said yes!\n\n\n*****************************************\n\n\nÂ Â When I went back home I went to my bedroom to put all my stuff up. We just sat around all night playing makeup and tried to tell each others fortune.Â \n\n\nÂ Â As I was putting away my sketchbook where I drew all of us last night at the beach.Â  Then I looked at the Raggity Anne on my bedside table. It looked as though the pen has been moved. Huh? Did I put it there yesterday?\n\n\nÂ Â I put the pen back to where I had it the other day. Then instinctively I grabbed the notepad and turned the other page. My heart started beating. No, this can't be possible.\n\n\nÂ Â On the other page there was another message:\n\n\nÂ Â Â Yes! I hope we can be friends too!Â \n\n\nÂ Â I felt like I was about too faint so I sat on the head. It can't be writing messages on it's own can it? Then I started trying to think rational and my head instantly went to mom.Â \n\n\nÂ Â Maybe mom got me this doll to communicate with me better? Yeah that must be it. Mom got me this doll as a way to better know her teenage daughter. I smile at the thought of mom writing me a message on the notepad after I got on the bus.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I then grabbed the pen and wrote another message:\n\n\nÂ Â What kind of things do you like to do Suzie?Â \n\n\nÂ Â I then put the pen down and took a shower. After I got done the pen was misplaced again with another message:\n\n\nÂ Â Well Mary I like to dance, sing, and read books! You think you can read one of your books to me?Â \n\n\nÂ Â Oh mom. I thought as i rolled my eye's. Then something occurred to me. My mom doesn't sing and she isn't much of a reader. She does like to dance though. Whenever one of her favourite country tracks come on the radio on her phone she would grab my hand and say,\" dance with me Mary!\" Then we would shuffle till we would get tired and we would just end upÂ  laughing.\n\n\nÂ Â We have to get to know each other a bit first how old are you? Where did you come from.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I then went downstairs as mom was yelling it was time to eat supper. While we were eating I asked mom if she got the doll. She then looked at me in a surprised look and starts laughing,\" oh sweety if i got you that doll I would've just straight up give it too you instead of being a woman of mystery.\"\n\n\nÂ Â What she said made since to me. Whenever mom gives me a present she just gives it to me in a wrapped box. She would never give me a gift unwrapped.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I told her goodnight after dishes were done and i went upstairs. I immediately looked at the notepad. This time I was dissatisfied as there was no message this time.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I'm sorry, did I make you mad?Â \n\n\nÂ Â After i wrote the message I then turned over and went to bed.Â \n\n\nÂ Â ******************************************\n\nÂ Â \n\nÂ Â The next day I came home from school crying. Two girls in my class were being mean to me today saying how I don't have a father and my mother goes into other men's houses(which isn't true!)Â \n\n\nÂ Â So after crying on my bed for a while I looked at the notepad. Sure enough a new message:\n\n\nÂ Â It's ok Mary. We are friends remember?Â \n\n\nÂ Â I stop sniffling and look at the message again and again. Now I know this isn't mom if I had any doubts before.Â \n\n\nÂ Â Then unlike all the other messages there was another one below:\n\n\nÂ Â You want me to help you with all your problems?Â \n\n\nÂ Â I looked at the notepad. Wondering if I should pick up the pen and write down yes because of the angry thoughts in my head. Then since i didn't think this will do anything I grabbed the pen and wrote one word:\n\n\nÂ Â YES\n\n\nÂ Â The next day after school, one of the girls that made fun of me looked like she didn't get much sleep the other night. She wasn't even paying attention to the other one that was trying to see what was wrong with her.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I noticed that every time that she looked at me she looked away. I didn't think of the notepad as for this beong the cause. For all I know the doll just writes to me and can't do nothing more.\n\n\nÂ Â That night before i went to bed I looked for another message and their it was.:\n\n\nÂ Â You want me to take care of the other one for you?Â \n\n\nÂ Â At this point I was only a little bit scared. I mean, did the doll do it? Did the doll make that one girl lose sleep the other night and frightened her that badly?Â \n\n\nÂ Â I thought again that the other girl shouldn't be the only onw of the pair to not lose sleep. Also she needed to pay to. I wote down Yes.Â \n\n\nÂ Â The next day the other girl didn't go to school. I heard rumors that the parents found her missing that night. Said that the town was going to commit a search the following week. My heart dropped. Did I really cause her to go missing? No way, no way a doll could make someone disappear!\n\n\nÂ Â I kept myself low that day at school incase people think that i made that girl disappear at school.Â \n\n\nÂ Â Whenever i got home mom was still at work. I went up to the notepad where it left a chilling message:\n\n\nÂ Â We make a great team don't we?\n\n\nÂ Â I was mad. I started yelling at the doll,\" what do you mean we make a great team! I didn't want you to make her go missing! If that's what you were doing in the first place!\"\n\n\nÂ Â I was ecstatic. I went into the shower to cool off. Then as I ran a towel down through my hair I actually thought of making a apology message to the doll.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I went back into my bedroom and saw another message. One that made me shiver all the way down my spine.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I didn't mean us Mary. I was talking about my brother.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I then felt something behind me like someone is crawling out from underneath my bed. Then I felt a big hand grabbed my leg as i screamed and stomped on it.Â \n\n\nÂ Â I am now in my bathroom. I called the police and my mom. I don't know how long I'll make it. He is banging on the door hard. I'm screaming at the person to please stop. But the banging continues.",

I asked my boss about his record, and he said that he was fairly clean other than drug charges. I have not slept in 3 days. I canât stay awake much longer, and my mom wonât be home for 3 days. This is so scary to me. I know I was rude to him but why would he take it to this extent.\n\nI keep finding small dead animals around my house. I want to call the police, but part of me feels like he is listening, and I am still alone. I am so on edge. If I could think straight maybe I would know how to deal with the problem. I have been carrying my switchblade, but to be honest he is a lot bigger than me, so if he attacks me, I am probably still screwed even with the knife. \n\nI really wish I lived in a city right now. Living in huge rural areas like mine make this so much worse. The closest âneighborâ I have is like a good 2 miles off and I am really scared to use my car right now. What if he messed with it? I canât seem to shake off the feeling that he is watching me right now. I feel like that no matter where I am. I found a picture of me in the shower next to the kitchen sink. Could a ghost even do things like this? \n\nI left the tab open before finishing this update and decided to make it longer because something awful just happened. My catâ¦ Oh god I feel like I am about to vomit. My cat is an outdoor cat, so I did not worry much about her but this is so awful. He left her at my doorstep. Her head is GONE. It is so cleanly sliced, there is no way another animal did this. This is sick. \n\nI feel like I am meant to take this as a threat. How else would someone take this? I have work tomorrow thank god. I have to sleep soon. I can't stay awake any longer, but I am just so terrified to fall asleep. What if he kills me because he knows I wonât put up a fight in my sleep. I just wish I could go back in time and treat him better. He was a shitty person and no one who knew him could deny it, but I had NO idea that the situation would be this bad. Was I really awful enough for him to do something like this?\n\nI never thought anything like this would happen to me. I am just so confused and scared. I donât know what to do anymore. If I donât get him away from me, I am going to lose it. I think I might have lost it already to be honest. \n\nI am just so tired. I canât stay awake any longer. If I donât update, Iâm dead.",

It was a family tradition, and one of the few times Iâd see some of my siblings, as most of them are all much older than me and have lives of their own. I remember my mom suggesting weâd stay at an Airbnb that year, as it was cheaper and not far from the ski hill, and we all thought that was a great idea, so my mom, my dad, my younger brother Jackson and I piled into the car to meet my older brother, Isaac, and my older sister Megan, and her husband Drew, I was so excited to see them.\n\nJackson and I jumped out of the car the second we arrived, eagerly looking forward to picking our shared room. \n\nâRace ya!â Jackson screamed, while barreling ahead of me.\n\nâHey! No fair!â I laughed, chasing him, but just barely keeping up. I followed him to our room, it was amazing. It had a big loft with our beds on it, and a huge tv, plus there was a giant window on the loft level.\n\nâThis place is awesome!â Jackson shouted while climbing up the ladder to the loft, I followed and peered out the window into the enchanting winter forest just behind the cabin, I had the feeling this trip was gonna be amazing.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nA few hours after we arrived, my 18 year old brother Isaac came, he marveled at the cabins beauty and charm, and so did Megan and Drew when they arrived. The first few days were great, we all drove to the ski hill together, my dad would take us boys skiing, while my mom and sister relaxed in the lodge, since my sister was pregnant with my first nephew at the time. It was on the 3rd night that something strange began to happen. I woke up at around 2 in the morning, to the sound of sticks or something being thrown at the huge window in Jackson and Iâs room. I sat awake and listened for a few moments while staring at the window, even though the curtain was covering the window, the light from the moon allowed me to watch the silhouetteâs of the sticks hitting the window, they werenât big, they were thin and small, but big enough to make a distinct tapping noise every time they hit.\n\n*tap*\n\n*tap*\n\n*tap*\n\nâDylan..â Jackson called tiredly. âStop with that noise.â\n\nâItâs not me, look!â I whisper shouted to him while pointing to the window, now he was watching the sticks hit the window.\n\nâWhat is that?â He whispered.\n\nâLetâs find out.â I whispered while creeping out of bed, I turned back to see if Jackson was following me, he hesitated, but curiosity overcame him and he crept after me. I rolls the curtains up, and gazed down into the darkness, I couldnât see anything despite the big bright moon, just a stick being tossed from the darkness below and hitting the window every few seconds, Jackson and I opened the window, the stick tossing ceased.\n\nâHello?â Jackson called, for a few moments it was quiet, but then someone responded.\n\nâHey Jackson, Hey Dylan!â The voice called, I recognized it immediately, it was Drew. Drew has a very distinct Australian accent, as he lived there most his life.\n\nâFunny prank Drew!â Jackson said playfully, then he closed the window and climbed back into bed.\n\nâIsnât that kinda weird?â I asked Jackson.\n\nâEh, heâs just playing around.â Jackson replied nonchalantly.\n\nI agreed, and went back to sleep. The next day was normal, Drew didnât mention anything about the prank, but it was in the back of my mind now, however that night I was awoken again by the same tapping on the window, at the same time as the night before, I immediately looked over at Jackson, we both got up and opened the window, again, all I saw was darkness, but this time I could hear Drew giggling.\n\nâHey Drew.â I said, a bit aggravated.\n\nâGuys..â Drew said between giggles, âcome out here!â \n\nJackson and I exchanged glances. âWe canât, mom and dad will get mad.â\n\nDrewâs giggling stopped, his tone got urgent and serious quickly. âYou gotta see this, come down here.â\n\nâNo.â I said.\n\nâCome down here!â Drew screamed angrily, a rock flew from the darkness, it just barely hit me, it fell through the window onto the floor, Jackson and I looked at each other in fear. Normally Drew was a polite and calm guy, with the ability of natural humor. He never raised his voice, he never took things too far. I knew him as a voice of reason, and he had become even calmer after learning he was going to have a baby.\n\nâIâm getting Megan!â Jackson cried, he rushed away, Drewâs screams grew louder and more aggressive.\n\nâGet out here now!â Drew screamed louder than ever, thatâs when I heard Jackson come running into the room with Megan.\n\nâDylan come down here now!â Megan called from below the loft, quickly I went down the ladder and ran into my sisters arms, Drew was still screaming from outside, I had my eyes closed while my sister hugged me, when I opened them I realized the terrifying truth.\n\n*Drew was standing right there*\n\nBut whoâs was currently standing outside our cabin screaming then? The person was still screaming for Jackson and I. Thoughts swarmed my mind, who was out there? How did it know my name? And why did it sound just like Drew?\n\nWe all stood in fearful silence, the voice stopped, but then a huge jagged rock as big as my head flew through the window, off the loft and straight at my sister, her real husband pulled her back quickly. She still screamed at the top of her lungs, which made my parents and Isaac rush into the room, they comforted my sister, and thatâs when I noticed the tall disfigured silhouette of something standing on the loft, I screamed while everyone else began noticing it, thatâs when we all booked it to the car, everyone piled in my parents car and we left the other cars behind. My mom was on the phone with the police for a lot of the drive, they searched the whole house and woods outside the house, to no avail.\n\nItâs been years since that happened, the baby my sister was pregnant with is in school now, but I still wake up in a cold sweat at night, thinking I heard a voice call me and tell me..\n\n\n\nâDylan, come out here.â",

        "text": "Looking for reddits advice on dealing with an issue thats come up with a couple friends of mine. Anonymizing the names for obvious reasons :p\n\nBasically my college friend C (34m) and his wife B (32f) are putting their house on the market for extremely cheap. Like, hella cheap. Asking price is $150k in an area where the homes usually go for mid six figures (!), even in the current market. \n\nBeing a close friend, and having some experience buying homes (yeah I know, my parents are rich, pls donât hate me), I decided to talk some sense into C about how he and B should raise the price to something sane, if for no other reason than for their kid Eâs college fund (heâs 8 and brainy as hell).\n\nWhen C refused to discuss it, I asked about buying the property myself. I flipped a house last year for some decent money and this one seemed like a steal. At first C told me flat out âno,â which I thought was strange since weâve been like brothers since college, but I guess ânever do business with familyâ is a decent rule to live by so no harm no foul.\n\nAfter that, the house just kind of stayed on the market. So like a moron I kept bringing it up when weâd see each other. And one day I guess I struck a nerve. Thatâs when he sent me this. \n\nApologies for the wall of text but I think itâs all relevant.\n\nâ\n\nRyan,\n\nThis is going to be a long letter because I could not write a short one. Please destroy it once you read it. Donât share it with anyone. And donât tell my wife I sent it to you.\n\nWe wonât be selling our house to you and I thought you deserved to know why.\n\nTwo years ago when we bought the house, do you remember when I gave you the tour? You mentioned how there werenât any mirrors in the bathrooms, no mirrors in the hallways, not even glossy countertops or anything like that. \n\nWe noticed that too during the open house but figured mirrors were cheap to replace.\n\nWell it was two days after closing when we get a call from the previous owner at 4 in the morning. \n\nNot a text. A call.\n\nI pick up the phone and the previous owner starts talking. I donât know what sheâs been drinking but sheâs been drinking something. She isnât making any sense. The call wakes up B too, so she puts on her glasses and I put the call on speakerphone.\n\nThe two of us listen to the last owner rambling, sobbing, carrying on and on about how sorry she is, and about reflections. Sheâs slurring her speech and repeating the same stuff over and over. Thankfully B is used to dealing with me when Iâm drunk, so sheâs somehow able to get this woman to slow down and explain herself.\n\nAnd the woman says there is a man who lives inside the mirror.\n\nI say âWhat?â Thereâs no answer so B repeats my question with appropriate urgency.\n\nAfter a while the previous owner says âHe lives inside the mirror. He watches what you do. He says things.â\n\nOkay. So already I am trying to remember the phone number for the local mental health center. But B is treating this more seriously than I am, because she is a good person and an eternal optimist and she takes people at their word. âWhat do you mean he lives in the mirror? Who lives in the mirror?â she asks.\n\nAnd thereâs a pause on the other end of the line.\n\nâHe is not dead, because he has never been alive,â the woman says. âDo not acknowledge him. Do not talk about him. Donât refer to him. Donât look him in the eyes. Donât make the mistakes I did.â\n\nThereâs a long pause and over the phone we can hear her taking another swig of something.\n\nâThatâs all?â I ask, only half serious.\n\nâI hope so,â the woman responds. And then the call is disconnected. \n\nWe do not hear from her ever again. I try to contact her the next day but she must be screening our calls because we can never get through. B tries to write a letter to the real estate agent to get in touch with her. Nothing.\n\nNow, for a while afterward B and I donât mention this call to each other. It doesnât come up. We are both thinking about it all the time of course, but we canât talk about it out loud to each other without seeming crazy ourselves. Not shockingly we manage to put off buying mirrors for the house for about two months, in denial about why. But fixing your hair in the carâs rearview is not as luxurious as it sounds so eventually we bite the bullet. And we get a contractor to come out and install mirrors.\n\nAnd itâs fine. Everything is fine. \n\nExcept there is a man. \n\nAnd this is the part where Iâm sure you think your old college roomie has completely lost it Ryan but I need you to listen to me because even if I lost it I am telling you the truth. \n\nThere is a man who lives inside the mirror. \n\nNot just one mirror in one room, but in every mirror in every room in the house. Every mirror you look into, he is there. Usually standing near the back of the room, usually buried in shadow if there are any shadows. But it is unmistakable. There is a man.\n\nThe man is middle aged. He is wearing a dark gray button up shirt, a black belt, gray pleated pants, and dull black shoes. And he doesnât move. He stands there, expressionless. His skin looks like it hasnât seen the sun. He has a crewcut, thin lips, and straw-colored hair. He looks like the kind of person you wouldnât notice in a group photo. And the thing about his eyes is, they are wide open. At first I thought he didnât blink, but B says she watched him for half an hour once and caught a total of two blinks. So it turns out he does blink. Just not much. Not enough.\n\nSo. There is a man who lives inside the mirror.\n\nAs you might expect, B and I nope the hell out of there. We take E who has not seen the man yet. We go to a motel about a mile from the house. Thankfully this motel is a man-living-in-mirror-free motel, which is a solid step up from our prior living situation.\n\nBut after a month, E is not taking motel life very well. Neither am I, and neither is B. Eâs grades are slipping even though he is the smartest kid in class. We talk about the financial loss of putting the house back on the market. It would be significant given the downturn, and even more significant given the man. At the moment we are paying a mortgage on top of motel costs. B eventually tells me she wants to at least try living in the house. \n\nâBut itâs haunted,â I say.\n\nâIt canât be haunted if he isnât dead,â she says. And she has a point.\n\nSo eventually I say okay. Letâs give it a shot. Letâs be brave. Letâs soldier on.\n\nAfter all, the man seems polite. And it *is* a beautiful house. And if you cover the mirrors in the living room and the bedroom you really only see the man in the bathrooms. And sometimes in the reflection of your laptop screen. And sometimes in the reflection in the windows. And like I said he seems polite.\n\nB and I sit down with E and we tell him about the man. E seems confused because heâs old enough to know that it is not normal for men to live inside of mirrors. We tell him the man is a secret. We tell him that we cannot mention the man to each other. That he shouldnât tell his friends about the man. That under no circumstances should he try to talk to the man.\n\nFor a few weeks everything is almost normal. We learn to ignore him. We get back into a routine. E is obviously afraid of the bathroom at first but eventually he gets used to it. Eventually we all get used to it. Iâm starting to think this could be sustainable. Maybe not long term, but long enough.\n\nIâm sure you remember when I was laid off Ryan. It was sudden. They cut 20% of staff. Well the timing couldnât have been worse because a few days after that in the middle of the night while I am lying awake worried about finances and when the house is dead silent I think I hear the sound of someone talking.\n\nNow, the voice is not loud. In fact it is the opposite of loud. It is quiet. But it is a voice.\n\nB is fast asleep so I get up. I go to Eâs room to check on him. He has the covers over his head but he seems okay. I assume heâs asleep because the voice is not coming from his room anyway. Itâs coming from the bathroom. \n\nI open the bathroom door. \n\nThe man who lives inside the mirror is standing by the bathroom closet and he is staring at me. \n\nThis is his usual spot. Whatâs unusual is that he is talking. Very quietly. \n\nI canât make out what he is saying, but heâs saying something. He is saying the same thing over and over and over again. I move closer to the mirror and point my ear toward it. I still canât make out what heâs saying. So I pick up a cup by the sink and I put the open side against the mirror and I take a deep breath and I put my ear to the cup. And I hear what he is saying. And he is saying:\n\nâCan you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you see me? Can you sââ\n\nI have heard enough.\n\nI take my ear off the cup and set the cup down. I leave the bathroom and shut the door behind me, making sure it clicks closed. I go back to the bedroom and I close the bedroom door and slide under the covers and shut my eyes. But the voice is still there. Itâs faint, but itâs there. So I turn on a fan to cover up the voice. But it doesnât help because in the white noise of the fan I am now imagining the voice. I lie back down. For the rest of the night I make attempt after hopeless attempt to get back to sleep.\n\nIn the morning B and I talk about whatâs happening, because the man is still giving his monologue. B is blaming me and I am blaming her. She says she is worried about me. She says she is worried that I am losing it. But I am not losing it. Then we see that E is crying. âI just wanted to know his name,â he says. âHe wouldnât tell me his name,â he says.\n\nNeither of us blame E. We too would love to know the manâs name. But it turns out this mistake is a permanent one, because now that the man is talking, he will not stop talking. \n\nFor an entire week he has been saying âCan you see me?â But at least he is still in the back of the room. At least he is still far enough away. At least he is still buried in shadow. Until he isnât. Until one day he is closer. Not all the way up to the mirror mind you, but closer.\n\nAnd all this time I am looking for work, but these companies, they hire friends, or friends of friends, or family members. And as it turns out I have fewer friends than I used to and I donât have the right family members. I am the wrong person entirely.\n\nI am starting to use the rearview mirror to fix my hair again. B uses it for makeup too, when she wears it. But for the most part neither of us want to look at ourselves. Thereâs a bucket in the laundry room. You pour it down the sink and wash it out when youâre done, but at least we donât have to see him. At least we donât have to hear him. \n\nBut it turns out there are some things that require a bathroom. And one night I canât take it anymore and I go in there and when I turn on the light he is all the way up to the mirror this time and he is not saying âCan you see me?â anymore because he is saying something new. I donât need to put a cup against the mirror to hear him. It is crystal clear.\n\nâI am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely. I amââ\n\nI turn out the light. I leave the bathroom and shut the door and go outside. I want to punch someone in the face but there is no one to punch and I canât exactly punch myself.\n\nBy the time I bring up the nerve to talk to B in the morning she has already heard the manâs new sentence and so has our son. E has had his share of emotional problems at school lately but this tops them all. He is a wreck. He is inconsolable. âWhy canât I talk to the man,â he says. âWe should be friends with the man,â he says.\n\nThat night I am more drunk than usual and I decide I am not going to spend another night in the house with him. So I abandon B and E and I go outside to try sleeping in the car. Just to get some rest. But when I get there B is already in the car with E because I guess they are trying to avoid me, and there isnât enough room for one more. So now I am trapped inside the house with him. I guess I am trapped.\n\nAnd so I let him have it. \n\nI tell him everything. I tell him heâs ruining our lives and he doesnât even pay rent. I tell him heâs never been alive and he shouldnât exist in the first place. I tell him heâs nothing. I tell him heâs worthless. I explain his worthlessness in fine detail. I am the Walt Whitman of explaining his worthlessness.\n\nBut he just keeps saying the same thing again and again in the same tone of voice. And I guess I must have been pretty drunk because in the morning my knuckles are scabbed over and there are shards embedded in them. The mirrors in the bathrooms are cracked and broken. And he is still in there saying âI am lonely. I am lonely. I am lonely.â\n\nB says she does not feel safe around me anymore but she is wrong. She is safe. I tell her so. I tell her that if she wants to be even safer we have to get rid of him. So she agrees. She is crying but she agrees. She tells me she is on my side. She tells me she will help get rid of him.\n\nI am still drunk so she drives us to the hardware store and we buy as much coarse grit sandpaper and and black spraypaint as we can. I guess any color would do but we decide on black. Black is best. We bring it home. \n\nI storm into the bathroom with a fresh can. I want to do it myself so I can see the look on his face when I do it. And when I walk in he is screaming this time. And his voice is so loud. His voice is like a jet taking off. It is an air raid siren. His voice is the loudest sound I have ever heard. It is louder than life itself and maybe it is louder than death. And his voice is saying:\n\nâWHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU LOVE ME? WHY DONâT YOU Lââ\n\nAnd I am spraypainting over him now. I am spraypainting his gray shirt and his gray pleated pants and his stupid crew cut and his thin lips. Spraypainting over the shards. Letting the paint drip down the walls. Letting it pool on the sink. And as I do he is getting quieter and quieter and quieter until I realize he canât get any more quiet than he is. Until I realize he is gone. Until he has been totally and completely eaten alive.\n\nAnd for the first time in weeks, maybe the first time in my entire life, it is silent.\n\nI hug B with tears in my eyes. She has tears in hers too. I tell her we have conquered this thing. She says we have conquered this thing. I tell her we are a family again. She says we are a family again. \n\nAnd we are a family again.\n\nI spraypaint the windows black from inside and then black from the outside because thereâs no reason to risk it. We start getting letters from the Homeowners Association. I spraypaint those black too.  The TV goes in the bin. E is crying. The glass comes off the picture frames. E is crying. The laptops go on ebay. \n\nE is crying.\n\nI tell B and E that for the next week the three of us have a job to do. Our job is to find pieces of him we missed. Polished banisters. Glossy wood. Exposed bulbs. Our job is to use the sandpaper to remove him. And for the next week we do the work. We live on sandpaper. I carry it with me like a weapon. I am an efficient hunter. The air fills with sanding dust. I learn this is called swarf, and I learn what it feels like to cough it out of my lungs. I learn what it feels like to watch E cough it out of his lungs.\n\nE is crying, and we are a family again.\n\nWe call the contractor to take down whatâs left of the broken, blackened mirrors. When the first contractor isnât returning my calls I try another one. Eventually we get it done. We are left with bare walls where the mirrors were. I drag B and E into the bathroom and show them. It is a glorious sight to behold. The contractor tries to sell us replacements but we explain to him that he can go fuck himself.\n\nAnd for the next month we are in paradise. E is crying of course, but we are in paradise. B and I arenât talking but we are in paradise. I stop caring about when Iâll get a job because the ordeal is over. There is finally peace in the house. There is silence. \n\nThere is silence, and we are a family again.\n\nAnd suddenly I donât know who the hell I am kidding. Suddenly I wonder how could this be paradise? The others avoid me like a disease. We are living in separate worlds. And then I notice B is spending more and more time sitting on the edge of the bathtub, staring at the bare wall where the mirror was, like she is trying to burn a hole through it with her eyes.\n\nAt first I donât say anything because I have nothing left to say to her. But eventually having nothing to say is no excuse. I confront her over it. I tell her we are not supposed to be trying to see the man. We are supposed to be moving on, like I asked. We are a family again, I say. \n\nAnd she says, âWhat if he was just lonely.â \n\nAnd the terrible thing is she means it. She actually means it. And she says, âWe should have talked to him. We should have made friends with him.â And I wonder how this horrible idea got into her head. I wonder who this person is.\n\nAnd then she says, âWhat kind of a lesson does this teach our son?â And I remember who this person is. I recognize this person. And she says âI canât stand the thought of him locked away in there. I can feel him. I know heâs still in there. He needs our love, C.â\n\nAnd she is right. She is right because she is always right. \n\nWe call the contractors and we apologize profusely. We say we actually do want to replace the mirrors. We love mirrors. We ask them how soon they could come by the house. We make plans. We sit down with E and we tell him about the mirrors. And E stops crying.\n\nAnd halfway through the job one of the men is complaining, and the others are arguing. One of them starts yelling at B in Spanish. She hasnât done anything wrong and he is yelling at her for some reason. And just as quickly as they start the job they abandon it. They leave the mirrors face-down on the carpet and they drive away.\n\nI follow B into the living room. She kneels at a mirror and gets her fingers underneath it and tilts it up. She sees something in it and then gently she sets it back down. She moves to the other side of the room and sits down in an armchair and makes herself small.\n\nI walk up to the mirror too. I get my fingers underneath it. I tilt it up.\n\nAnd I find out B is right. She is right because she is always right. \n\nHe is still there but he is seated. He is seated this time. He is seated in a wooden chair. He is seated in a wooden chair and he is done talking. He is not talking anymore. His eyes are just as wide, but his jaw hangs loose. His jaw hangs loose and his arms dangle at his sides. The blood from his slashed wrists streaks down his forearms and snakes between his fingers and drips to the ground and forms two identical pools. \n\nThe dripping never stops. The blood never dries. The body never decays.\n\nThe man is in every room of our home Ryan. We have gotten rid of all the polished surfaces and every mirror and every pane of glass but he is still right there in every single room of our home. Because he is in the reflection in the glasses on my wifeâs face. \n\nAnd when she is not wearing her glasses, he is in her eyes. \n\nAnd he is in Eâs eyes. \n\nAnd he is in mine.\n\nI have tried to catch him blinking. I have sat on the floor for hours staring at his reflection in Eâs eyes. E doesnât like this game but I tell him we have to play it. I tell him we have to try. I have been unsuccessful so far, but I have to keep trying. Thereâs a part of me that knows heâs in there somewhere. That he isnât really dead. That heâs still watching us. If only I could catch him. If only I could see him blink.\n\nBecause if I donât, Ryan, if he really is dead, then the house is haunted.\n\nAnd this is the reason we havenât sold. This is the reason. The buyer must agree to watch him for us. The buyer must agree, because someone needs to watch him for us. Someone needs to see him blink. We wonât be there anymore to do it so someone needs to do it for us. Someone needs to watch him.\n\nSo far, no one has had the courage.\n\nAnd this is why we will not sell you our house Ryan. This is why we will never sell you our house.\n\nYou do not have what it takes.\n\nNo one does.\n\nYours,  \nC\n\nâ\n\nI tried calling C to talk about the letter he sent me but I havenât heard back from him yet.\n\nThe last thing I want to do is overshare something private and have C and B find out Iâm a shitty friend, so Iâm planning to delete this post soon (hence the throwaway). But before I do that I wanted an outside perspective.\n\nBasically, Iâm totally still interested in buying as long as B and C are willing to let it go. Flipping it should be a breeze for someone like me â itâs a beautiful home, as long as Iâm careful with how I stage it. \n\nI guess what Iâm asking is, would I be taking advantage of my friends to profit off this? And whatâs the best way to bring up the idea to B? I would need to get on her good side to make the deal happen. \n\nThanking you in advance for your help.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/theawfullest/comments/10mdxhb/collected_works/)",

        "text": "It all started when I was a little girl. My parents would tell me stories of the devil and his minions, trying to scare me into being a good person. But as I got older, those stories became less and less frightening to me. That is, until I met him.\n\nI was in college, studying psychology, when I first became aware of his presence. I had always been fascinated by the occult and the idea of other dimensions and entities existing alongside our own. So when I stumbled upon a group that claimed to be able to summon and communicate with demons, I knew I had to join.\n\nAt first, it was just a thrill. We would gather in a dimly lit room, chanting and calling out to the spirits. But then, one night, something answered. His name was Azazel, and he was unlike anything I had ever encountered before.\n\nHe was beautiful in a terrifying way. His skin was a deep, obsidian black and his eyes glowed red like embers. He was tall and muscular, with horns protruding from his forehead and wings that seemed to stretch on forever. But it wasn't just his appearance that was terrifying, it was the way he looked at me. It was as if he could see straight into my soul and was amused by what he saw.\n\nAfter that night, Azazel became a regular presence in my life. He would appear to me in my dreams, whispering secrets and promises in my ear. He taught me things, showed me things, and I couldn't get enough. I knew it was dangerous, but I couldn't help myself. I was addicted to the power and knowledge he bestowed upon me.\n\nBut as our relationship grew, so did the consequences. I began to notice strange occurrences happening around me. Objects would move on their own, shadows would take on a life of their own, and I would wake up with strange bruises and cuts on my body. My friends and family grew worried, but I couldn't bring myself to tell them the truth.\n\nThings came to a head when Azazel began to demand more and more from me. He wanted me to perform sacrifices, to bring him offerings of blood and pain. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't resist him. I was under his spell, and he had complete control over me.\n\nThat's when I realized that I had made a grave mistake. I had opened a door that should have remained closed, and now I was paying the price. I tried to break away from him, to end our relationship, but it was too late. He had me under his thumb, and he wasn't going to let me go easily.\n\nI was trapped, a pawn in a game between the forces of good and evil. And I knew that the only way to end it was to destroy him. But how do you destroy a demon?\n\nI did some research and I found out that there is only one way to destroy a demon. He must be banished back to his own dimension. But I didnât know how to do it. So I began to look for people who could help me. I found a group of people who were experts in the field of demonology. They were all very experienced and knowledgeable, and I was able to learn a lot from them.\n\nI learned that the ritual of banishing a demon is very dangerous. I had to be very careful and precise in every step. I had to prepare everything exactly as required, and I couldnât make any mistakes. I had to be very focused and determined, and I had to be willing to sacrifice everything.",

        "text": "I've always been fascinated by caves and the mysteries they hold deep within the earth. So when my friends invited me to go spelunking in a remote cave system in the mountains, I jumped at the chance. We had planned this trip for months and we were all excited to explore the unknown.\n\nThe cave was located in a remote area and it was known for being one of the most challenging caves in the region. But that's what made it so exciting. We arrived at the cave entrance in the early morning and began our descent. The cave was dark and damp, and the only light came from our headlamps. We moved slowly, carefully navigating the twisting tunnels and narrow passageways. We were all experienced cavers but we knew that we were going to be facing some challenges that day.\n\nAs we descended deeper into the cave, the air grew colder and the silence was almost deafening. We were the only ones down there and it felt like we were the first ones to set foot in the cave. We were in awe of the beauty of the cave and we were all taking pictures and videos of the cave formations, the stalactites and stalagmites. We made our way through the cave, marveling at the beauty of the underground world.\n\nBut as we turned a corner, we saw something that made our blood run cold. Scrawled on the cave wall in what looked like blood was a single word: \"LEAVE.\" We paused for a moment, trying to make sense of what we were seeing. But before we could even speak, we heard a sound that made our hearts race - the sound of footsteps coming from deep within the cave.\n\nWe didn't waste any time. We turned and ran, our headlamps bouncing wildly as we scrambled through the dark tunnels. But the footsteps were getting closer and closer, and we knew we couldn't outrun whatever was chasing us. We could hear the sound of heavy breathing, the sound of something dragging behind us.\n\nWe stumbled and fell, crawling on our hands and knees to try and get away. But the darkness was all around us, and we were lost in the maze of caves. We could hear the thing behind us, its breath hot on our necks, and we knew we were going to die down there in the darkness. We were running out of options and our only hope was to find a way out of the cave.\n\nAs the hours passed, we became more and more disoriented and our nerves were frayed. We were running out of water and food, and the batteries of our headlamps were running low. We were starting to lose hope, and we knew that our chances of survival were slim.\n\nBut just when all hope seemed lost, we saw a light. It was the cave entrance, and we had made it out alive. We emerged from the cave, gasping for breath, and we never spoke of what had happened in the cave again. But, as we were leaving the cave, we saw something that gave us chills. The word \"LEAVE\" was written in blood, not only on the cave wall but also on the cave entrance.\n\nWe were all shaken by the experience and we couldn't shake the feeling that something was down there with us, something that should not have been there. And I can't shake the feeling that it's still down there, waiting for its next victims.\n\nAfter that experience, we never went back to the cave, and we never spoke of it again. But the memory of that cave and the thing we encountered in",

        "text": "It started as a normal night, just like any other. I had just finished dinner and was settling in to watch some TV before bed. But then, I heard a noise. At first, I thought it was just the wind outside, but it was a sound that seemed too deliberate, too intentional. I shrugged it off and turned up the volume on the TV, but the noise persisted. It was coming from the other room.\n\nI got up to investigate, my heart pounding in my chest. I slowly opened the door to the other room, but it was empty. I searched every corner and found nothing out of the ordinary. The sound seemed to have stopped, so I went back to the living room and continued watching TV, trying to shake off the feeling of unease.\n\nBut the noise returned, this time louder and more insistent. I knew now that it was not coming from outside, but from within my own home. I froze in terror as the sound grew louder, coming closer and closer. I could hear something scratching at the walls, whispering my name.\n\nI tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move. I was trapped, paralyzed with fear. I tried to call out for help, but my voice was just a whisper. I felt like something was holding me down, preventing me from moving or making a sound.\n\nI could see the shadows moving on the wall, growing and shifting, taking on a life of their own. I could see the shapes of hands and feet, claws and teeth. And then, I saw it. A figure emerging from the shadows, its eyes glowing with a sinister light. It reached out to me, its clawed hand inches from my face. I let out a scream, but no sound came out. The figure just stood there, staring at me with a cold, malevolent grin.\n\nI closed my eyes and prayed that when I opened them again, the figure would be gone. But it wasn't. It was still there, still staring at me. I could feel its breath on my face, could feel its cold fingers on my skin. I was trapped, unable to move or scream or do anything at all.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure was gone. The scratching and whispering stopped. The shadows retreated back into the corners of the room. I was alone again, but the terror still gripped me. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still there, waiting for me.\n\nI tried to sleep but I couldn't, I was too scared that the figure would come back. I stayed awake the whole night, staring at the shadows and listening for any sound. But there was nothing, only silence.\n\nThe next day, I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone about my experience, I was too scared that they would think I was crazy. But I knew that it wasn't just a nightmare, it was real. I still don't know what it was or what it wanted, but I know that it was something evil. And I know that it's only a matter of time before it comes for me again.\n\nI started to notice small changes in my home, like a picture frame hanging crooked or a door left slightly ajar when I knew I had closed it. I would hear strange noises in the middle of the night, like something scratching at the walls or whispering my name. I tried to ignore it, to tell myself that it was just my imagination. But the fear was always there, gnawing at me, growing stronger with each passing day.\n\nI knew I had to do something before it was too late, so I decided to investigate. I started to research the history of my home, trying to find any clues that might explain the strange occurrences that I had been experiencing. I talked to the previous owners and neighbors, but no one had any information that could help me. I even contacted local historians and paranormal experts, but they had no answers either.\n\nAs I dug deeper, I began to uncover a dark history of my home. I discovered that it had been built on an ancient burial ground, and that the land had been sacred to the indigenous people who once lived there. I learned that they had been driven off their land by settlers, and that their spirits had been left to wander, seeking revenge on those who had taken their land.\n\nI also discovered that there had been a series of strange and unexplained deaths in my home over the years. Some had been ruled as accidents, while others had been labeled as suicides. But as I looked into the circumstances surrounding these deaths, I began to suspect that there was something more sinister at work.\n\nI knew that I had to find a way to put the spirits to rest and protect my home from their wrath. I tried to perform a traditional Native American ceremony, but it seemed to have no effect. I consulted with a local spiritual leader, but he too had no answers.\n\nI was at my wits' end, and I knew that I had to take drastic measures. I decided to move out of my home, but as I was packing my things, I found an old journal hidden away in the attic. It was the diary of the original settlers who had built my home on this land.\n\nAs I read through the diary, I discovered that they had been aware of the sacred nature of the land and had deliberately desecrated the burial ground in order to build their home. They had known that they were angering the spirits of the land and had even performed dark rituals to ward off any potential attacks.\n\nI realized that the spirits had been seeking revenge all these years, and that I was just the latest victim of their wrath. I understood that the only way to put them to rest was to make amends for the wrongs that had been committed so many years ago.\n\nI consulted with a local indigenous leader and together we performed a ceremony to honor the spirits of the land and ask for their forgiveness. We also built a small memorial on the land to commemorate those who had been buried there.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the strange occurrences in my home stopped. I no longer heard scratching or whispering in the night, and the shadows no longer seemed to move on their own. I felt a sense of peace that I had not felt in a long time.\n\nI realized that sometimes the only way to find peace is to confront the past and to make amends for the wrongs that have been done. I will never forget the lessons that I have learned and the spirits that have shown me the way.\n\nI decided to stay in my home, but with a newfound respect and understanding of the land and the spirits that reside there. I will always be mindful of the past and will do my best to honor the spirits and ensure that they can finally rest in peace.\n\nI know that there will always be a part of my home that is sacred, and I will always be grateful for the lessons that I have learned and the peace that I have found. I will never forget the terror that I experienced, but I will always remember the peace that came after.",

        "text": " \n\nI've always been fascinated by the woods behind my house. Growing up, I spent countless hours exploring the trails and observing the wildlife. But lately, I've been noticing something strange.\n\nIt started a few weeks ago, when I was out for a walk in the woods. I caught a glimpse of something moving in the distance, but when I tried to get a closer look, it was gone. I assumed it was just my imagination and didn't think much of it. But then it happened again, and again. Each time, the figure was just out of reach, always lurking in the distance.\n\nI've tried to get a closer look, but each time I approach the figure disappears. It's almost as if it's trying to avoid me. I've asked my friends and family if they've seen anything, but they all think I'm crazy. They say I'm just seeing things, that it's just my imagination. But I know what I saw, and it's starting to feel like I'm being watched.\n\nIt's not just in the woods, either. I've started to feel like I'm being followed, even when I'm not in the woods. I can't shake the feeling that something is following me. I've started to avoid going into the woods altogether, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm being drawn back in.\n\nI've started researching online, trying to find out if anyone else has experienced anything similar. But all I've found are stories of ghostly figures and supernatural beings. I don't believe in ghosts, but I can't explain what I've been seeing.\n\nI've been trying to rationalize it, to find a logical explanation for what I'm seeing. But the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that there's something sinister lurking in the woods. I don't know what it is, but I can't shake the feeling that it's only a matter of time before it comes for me.\n\nOne night, while lying in bed, I heard a strange noise outside my window. I got up to investigate, and I saw the figure again, standing just outside my house, staring at me through the window. I immediately locked all the doors and windows, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it was still out there, watching me.\n\nThe next day, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I grabbed a flashlight and a camera, determined to get to the bottom of this once and for all. I searched the woods for hours, but I didn't find anything out of the ordinary. But as I was about to head back home, I heard a noise behind me. I turned around, and there it was again, the figure, standing just a few feet away from me.\n\nI froze, unsure of what to do. And then, as quickly as it appeared, it was gone again. I ran back home, and I haven't been back in the woods since.\n\nI know this sounds crazy, but I had to share my story. I've been feeling paranoid and alone with this, and I hope that by sharing my experience, I can find someone who can relate, who can help me make sense of what's been happening. I hope that there's someone out there who can tell me that I'm not going crazy, that there's a logical explanation for what's been happening. But until then, I'll be avoiding the woods, just in case. And I can't shake off the feeling that the figure is still out there, waiting for me.",

        "text": "I donât like to talk about my experiences with the peligots, but Dr. Yuger has been telling me lately that Iâll never heal if I keep silent. I guess weâll see.\n\nBack in the late 90âs, I was stationed at a base near a mountain pass as part of a UN peacekeeping mission in Eastern Europe. The nearby road was critical for transporting troops and supplies. The mission was basically to keep it safe for our side and dangerous for the other guys.\n\nThe key thing above all else was to keep friendly with the locals. We were a small force, and the nearby villageâs populace outnumbered us a twenty to one. They were our eyes and ears, feeding us a ton of valuable intel on enemy movements, rumored attacks, upcoming weather, you name it. The primary directive was not to piss them off.\n\nThe first time I saw a peligot, Iâd been having a shitty day to say the least. Iâd just gotten news that my wife was leaving and taking my kid, and all that the other guys in my squad would tell me was good riddance. Now, we generally werenât supposed to venture out into the countryside, much less alone, but letâs just say I was in a mood, and no one cared enough to stop me.\n\nI saw the peligot sitting in a tree at the top of a hill. At first, I thought it was a monkey, but when I got closer, I saw that it looked more like a sloth. Itâs gray-white fur glistened in the low winter sun. As I approached the tree, it climbed higher in the branches, clearly afraid of me.\n\nâItâs okay, little fella,â I said. âI wonât hurt you.â\n\nAnd then the peligot echoed back in its raspy, high pitched voice, âWonât hurt you.â\n\nI stayed there for hours, telling the peligot about my wife as it repeated my words back to me.\n\nThe other guys at base all had their opinions on the animals. Some said they were just parrots, repeating what we said. Others said theyâd seen them solve puzzles and count to three. \n\nBefore the conflict, the western world had basically written them off as a myth, and now, no scientists had been stupid enough to risk their lives to come and study them in a war zone.\n\nIâd always loved animals, and I guess I took kind of a shine to the creatures. I had a bank of uneaten MREs that Iâd shlep up the hill to my little buddy, who I nicknamed Nails (he had incredibly long nails he used for climbing.) \n\nIâd spend a lot of evenings sitting under the tree, talking through my shit while Nails listened, occasionally repeating what I said. Honestly, Iâd probably never met a better listener in my whole life.\n\nApparently, Nails told his friends about the food, because after a few visits, about half a dozen peligots were waiting for me whenever I came. \n\nAt first, they were afraid of me, but when I kept giving them food without doing any harm, they eventually let me get close enough to pet them. \n\nâThank you,â I taught them to say, and they all squeaked it back at me every time they ate. And then weâd sit there for an hour, with me telling tales of my dadâs ranch back in Utah and all the trouble Iâd caused as a boy.\n\nOne night I woke to screams from the nearby village. The place itself was maybe a mile across the valley, but the sounds carried in the night. \n\n*âPlease,â* someone was shouting in English. *âNo kill me! No kill me! Please!â*\n\nI woke up a couple of the guys, just to make sure I wasnât imagining things. It had been a few minutes, and the sounds continued. Finally, I woke the captain.\n\nâSir,â I said. âShouldnât we investigate?â\n\nHe laughed and shook his head.\n\nâItâs just a peligot,â he said. âCanât you tell by the high-pitched voice? The locals are having a festival tomorrow.â\n\nâSir,â I said, trying to control my shaking voice. âTheyâre killing it.â\n\nâIâd expect so,â said the captain. âHard to eat it while itâs still alive. Now, I canât say I condone the way they torture the poor things before they die. Something about the taste, they say. But then again, itâs not our job to rewrite their local customs.â\n\nâBut sir,â I said. âWe canât just let themââ\n\nâGet back to bed,â said the captain, angry now. âItâs our job not to piss these people off. And taking food out of their mouths would certainly qualify. What, you some kind of vegetarian or something?â\n\n*âPlease!â* shouted the voice, a little weaker now. *âNo kill! No kill!â*\n\nBy the time I went to get my gun and try to sneak out, the cries had ceased. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, imagining the suffering creature across the valley.\n\nThe next morning, I found myself shaking with fear. In the mess hall, the smell of bacon made me gag. I looked at my squadmates and was possessed with the near certainty that they were planning to kill me in my sleep and eat me. \n\nâYou good?â asked one of my old buddies, and I imagined his teeth cutting through my flesh.\n\nI told him I was sick and left breakfast without eating.\n\nOf course, we werenât invited to attend the festival that day, but I watched the marketplace through my binoculars. Various meats roasted on spits. Some must have been goat and lamb. Some wasnât. I watched them eating: the old men gumming the meat, the children carelessly dropping their plates in the dirt. \n\nI threw up.\n\nLater, I took a walk to the tree, counting the peligots as I approached. There were five of them now instead of six.\n\nâRock Boy dead,â said Nails. I hadnât known the rest of his tribe had names. âRock Boy taken. Screamed so much. Rock Boy dead.â\n\nâIâm sorry,â I said. âIâm so sorry.â\n\nI would have said more, except that a rocket hit the base. Nails and the other peligots startled and started running for the valley (not that they could go very fast) but I knew any enemy attack would progress right through there. \n\nâThat way!â I shouted, pointing to the mountains. Nails must have understood, because he reversed course, and the others followed. \n\nI waited until theyâd made it safely out of harmâs way. Then I ran for the base to find the barracks basically obliterated. \n\nThere must have been a dozen bodies there alone. And even as I arrived another rocket struck, taking out the armory. At the same time, I could see the village was under bombardment across the valley. \n\nThe festival was now a scene of carnage. Blood ran down the gutters, and I could hear the villagersâ screams, punctuated with the blasts of additional rocket impaces.\n\nâGet on the fucking comm!â shouted my captain. He was crawling toward me from the armory, both legs missing below the knee. âGet us some goddamned air support to take out those launchers or his whole place is gonna go up!â\n\nAs he said this, he just seemed to notice his legs for the first time and started screaming, over and over again.\n\nAmazingly, the comms were totally untouched. I was able to reach headquarters easily.\n\nâWhatâs your status?â asked the voice on the other line. \n\nSuddenly, I realized that for the first time since Iâd heard the peligot screaming, I felt a sense of peace. Another explosion rattled the windows, and I heard someone yelling that they were burning. But in that moment, it all seemed *right* to me. Watching the base burn, and the village across the way, my only thoughts were of Nails. I hoped he and the rest of his clan were okay.\n\nâWhatâs your status?â repeated the voice on the comm, but I just hung up and ran toward the mountains.\n\nOf course, Dr. Yuger reminds me that after the war, numerous scientists attempted to locate the peligots, only to include theyâd always been a local legend. Perhaps they were wiped out over the course of the conflict. \n\nI prefer to think of them as still living in those remote mountains somewhere, maybe telling each other, âThank you, thank you,â as they share a bit of food. \n\nAs for me, I suppose they never should have let me back into the world. They found me near the ruins of the base a few days later, shellshocked and babbling, the only survivor without catastrophic injuries. \n\nWhen I got back to the states, I looked around, and all I ever saw were monsters. Everyone suddenly looked so fat. And they just kept eating and eating, all the time. I couldnât stand to look at them.\n\nMaybe I felt like I had to punish people. And so I did, over and over again. \n\nFinally, I got caught and started my work here with Dr. Yuger. \n\nI appreciate that he lets me get online and talk to people. He says itâs an important part of my rehabilitationâto connect with others in a virtual space where I donât have to think about them eating. He keeps saying I can be fixed, but only if I want to be, and maybe thatâs the problem. Because I think the world needs people like me, or itâll never get fixed.\n\nAnd when youâre thinking like that, you end up doing some very bad things. At least as far as the monsters are [concerned](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/).",

        "text": "I hope this reaches you and I hope I'm still alive by the time it does.\n\nI know I didn't update in some time. There's a good reason for that. That reason being the fact that I'm currently hiding. \n\nLet's start from the beginning. \n\nA lot of you advised me to stop eating my \"husband's\" breakfasts. At this point I'm going to have to find him a nickname, because I am so sick and tired of referring to him as \"my husband\". Can we go with The Impostor? Yeah, that sounds good.\n\nOk, so... I read your advice and absolutely, I thought it was a great idea. What I didn't anticipate was the amount of suspicion it was going to bring upon me.\n\nThe day after my last post, I woke up in the morning to the smell of bacon, eggs and toast. I closed my eyes and sighed, bracing myself to what was coming. \n\nI got up, put on my slippers and headed for the kitchen, where the Impostor had my breakfast ready as per usual. I gave him my best fake smile and said \"good morning honey!\" to which he replied in the same fashion. I looked at the breakfast and said \"oh, I'm not sure I'm going to be able to eat today... I'm feeling a bit nauseated\". He stared at me. There was a long silence that I decided to break by saying \"I'm sorry babe\". \n\nHe just sat there in silence for what felt like an eternity, staring at me. I was about to break the silence again when he sighed deeply and said \"not this shit again...\".\n\n-Huh? What do you mean? - I asked, visibly confused.\n\n-You found it, didn't you?\n\n-I found... What exactly?\n\nI knew damn well what he was talking about, but I did my best to feign ignorance. Apparently it worked, because he stared at me briefly, uncrossed his arms and said\n\n-Well... Nevermind. I'm still sleepy, don't mind me.\n\nHe unlocked his wheelchair and I asked what was he doing. He answered \n\n-You're not leaving home without breakfast. I'm preparing you some tea at least.\n\n-Don't worry, I'll do it - I said, in hopes he would leave it at that.\n\n-I said - he lowered his voice - *I* will do it. Go get dressed.\n\n-But...\n\n-I said go!\n\nNot sure if it was the fact that he was clearly mad or the fact I hadn't heard him yell at me for 20 years, but this made me shiver and whimper. I thanked him and went away to get dressed, knowing fully well I'd have to drink the tea.\n\nAt least at this point it was fairly clear to me you guys were right. It was also extremely clear I wouldn't be able to skip breakfast. \n\nI left to work while giving my best act of \"everything is fine\".\n\nOn my way to work, I called my boss. Told her I had some important stuff to do and I'd come in later. I also told her if anyone calls asking for me, tell them I'm working but I'm busy. She understood in my voice something was seriously wrong and ended the call with \"please, stay safe\".\n\nI drove to the police station and parked behind it, in an alley away from the eyes of the crowd. Even though I knew he was in a wheelchair, I couldn't shake the feeling he was going to follow me. I didn't know how, but I just had this gut feeling, you know?\n\nI entered the station and looked around. I couldn't see the officer I had talked to last time. \n\n-Can I help you ma'am?\n\n-Huh... Yes. I was looking for officer... Atkins?\n\n-Oh, Oliver Atkins? Sure, wait here is ma'am. Atkins!\n\nThe man I had talked to previously approached with a smile. I sighed in relieve.\n\n-Hey there Mrs. Smith! What can I do for you?\n\n-Hello officer. I... I need your help. Can we talk somewhere more private?\n\nOfficer Atkins looked at me with a serious face as his ever-lasting smile faded away.\n\n-Come with me.\n\nI followed him to a small room in the back. It was something between a meeting room and an interrogation room. It had only a desk and two chairs, one on each side, no windows, but a very normal door, which didn't strike me as the entrance of a place they'd put criminals in.\n\nAtkins motioned me to sit and sat in front of me. \n\n-So Mrs. Smith. You're safe here. What can I help you with?\n\n-This might be hard to believe. Trust me, I've been trying to wrap my head around it for some days too...\n\n-Is it about that man who lives with you?\n\nI froze in place. I wasn't expecting that. \n\n-Well... Yes.\n\nAtkins looked at me and sighed. \n\n-Ma'am, I won't lie to you. And don't take this as a judgement. But when I saw that man at your house right after Jim died, I had a weird feeling. You didn't strike me as someone who would move on that fast and you were devastated at the funeral. And then, not even a week later, you give up Elisa for adoption and this guy moves in...\n\n-ADOPTION? - I'm not sure what my face looked like, but he looked frightened.\n\n-Y... Yes ma'am... Don't you remember?\n\nI realized I was now up and stiff as a log. I looked around in confusion and then succumbed back down to my chair.\n\n-I... I don't remember... I don't remember anything... I... I...\n\nAt this point I was sobbing. Atkins got up to try to comfort me. \n\n-I... Think he's been drugging me... I thought he was Jim...\n\nAtkins stopped comforting me out of shock. \n\n-Wait... What? Jim is dead! How could it be Jim? What led you to think that?\n\nI took a few deep breaths trying to compose myself. When I could finally talk, I explained everything I explained you guys so far. The breakfasts, the death certificate, what I remember, what I apparently don't, everything.\n\nAtkins sat on his chair, trying to process what I had just told him.\n\n-Ma'am, I... Can I call you Allison?\n\n-Of course.\n\n-Allison, that's a lot. And I don't think I can help you as an officer. The obvious procedure here would be to take you to be evaluated by a psychiatrist and you would likely be sent to an unit for treatment...\n\n-Oh my God... Please don't... - I pleaded.\n\n-Of course not. Call me crazy, but I believe you. Hell, this could cost me my job, but I do. And I think you're in danger. Did it occur to you this man might be Jim's killer? I mean, that would explain why we can't find him.\n\nI told him the truth: it did. It would make perfect sense. Being at home all the time, nobody being aware of his identity... According to Atkins they did look into him as a suspect, but he had a pretty strong alibi: he was at the hospital.\n\n-Ok Allison, here's what we're going to do: go home after work, I'll go there later today about an anonymous tip. Act surprised. I'll try my best to see if he let's me check the house. Then we'll see how it plays out.\n\nI agreed, thinking to myself it was a shabby plan but still, it was the best I had. \n\nAs I was leaving, I heard Atkins yell \"Allison, get down!\"\n\nAcross the door, came a bullet. I looked ahead to see where it came from... To see the Impostor standing, fully capable, his gun pointing at me.",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I originally posted the start of this experience as part 1 of a series, but it got deleted because it was identified as an intro only. More has happened now so I'm posting the story in full. It all started yesterday (Thursday) and I have absolutely no words for it.\n\nSo, letâs start with the least interesting part. Yesterday, at around 19:00, I came home from a long day at work. It was already dark. After watching tv for an hour or 2 I started getting really tired, so I decided it was time to go to bed. When I entered my room, my eyes fell on my nightstand. There was an envelope there. \n\nNot just an ordinary envelope. It was a pitch black envelope with a white skull on it. I felt a shiver run down my spine. I live alone, so I am the only one that has the keys for this house. Also, the envelope certainly wasnât mine. I checked the house for any signs of burglary, but I couldn't find any. All windows and the backdoor were fully closed and locked. The front door had also been locked when I came home from work.\n\nI couldnât get my head around how this envelope ended up on my nightstand, but despite my confusion and fear, I needed to open it. So, I did. It was handwritten. This is what it said:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHello there. Do you remember all those times that you were scared when trying to fall asleep? Scared that something might crawl through your window in the middle of the night, or that you would suddenly hear a knock on your door which isnât coming from your parents? Or maybe you were scared that that thing under your bed might creep out, not realizing that that thing under your bed wouldn't bother to show itself, it would rather just grab your ankles and pull you under the bed so it can eat you alive. \n\nYour parents always said that you would be fine and that there was nothing to worry about. That was a lie. They forgot about me. Iâm that car you didnât see, the virus that almost killed you, even though you didnât notice a thing. Iâm that lightning bolt which almost took your plane down, that heart attack you narrowly escaped, that shadow in the corner of your room. Still, naive as you are, you believed your parents and so you tried to relax and eventually you started a botherless sleep, every time again. \n\nNow you probably think that Iâm kidding, because you're old enough to know that there is nothing under your bed, and that there will be no-one at your bedroom door tonight. Thatâs true, both things are not the case. I have much better and scarierer ways to enter your room. Iâve used a lot of different methods in the past years. Iâve been there hundreds of times. To watch you sleep, without you knowing that I was standing right there, at your sight. Watching your beautiful face when youâre fast asleep. \n\nIâve been chasing you. Iâve been so close plenty of times, without you noticing a single thing. Remember those moments when you were almost run over by a car? Those times when you frightenedly woke up, without knowing what happened? That was me, experimenting with my capabilities. Those were the moments I almost got you. I didnât want you dead then, I was just having fun. A year ago my feelings slowly started to shift. I decided that your time has come.\n\nI have been living up to this night for a long time. Thatâs why I sneaked up so many times into your room, to watch the person whoâs life Iâm going to end someday.\n\nYou might think this is all a yoke. You canât be further from the truth. I can promise you, there will be no tomorrow. Not for you. Youâve been on this earth for too damn long. \n\nSo, what am I?\n\nCall me your Doom. Iâve been chasing and playing with you for years on end. That time is over. Too often have I let you slip through my fingers. Not tonight, tonight I am coming for you, and this time I will get you.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI would love to wash it off as some sick prank or something like that. But how? There simply werenât any logical solutions for this. I donât believe in the supernatural. But if this was just someone trying to scare me, or someone who actually wanted me dead, how did they come into my house without leaving any trace? Also it wasnât written in any handwriting I recognized. Genuinely scared, I decided to call the police. \n\nâWhat theâ¦.â\n\nI had no service.\n\nI never, NEVER, had any problems with that.\n\nThen I realized something. The intruder might still be in the house. I always kept a pretty decent pocket knife in my nightstand. I thought this was the right moment to grab it. Luckily, it was still there. Shivering but determined, I checked the entire house again, with my knife in my hand. While I was searching in the living room, my phone buzzed. It scared the freak out of me. I checked and I saw I had a text. Hyped about having a signal again I opened it, ready to call the police immediately after.\n\nI froze.\n\n*âIâm not in the house, stop wasting your last hoursâ.*\n\nIn the bar where it should say the number it said âyour Doomâ.\n\nI checked my contacts to see if maybe âyour Doomâ has been added through a virus or something. There wasnât any contact going by that name, though. Also it still said I had no service. How had the message even arrived?\n\nI started sweating heavily. I took a deep breath and decided it would be best to just go to bed, and go to the police station tomorrow, when the sun was up again. I layed the knife under my pillow.\n\nAfter a long time of efforts to calm down, I finally entered a troubleless sleep. \n\nI awoke to a ticking sound. I froze, and listened. I thought it must be coming from one of the windows downstairs. I didnât dare to move. After a few minutes the sound suddenly stopped. For a while it was silent. \n\nThen, the ticking continued on my bedroom window. In a reflex I grabbed the knife from under my pillow. Not able to move any more, I stayed in bed, frightened to the bone, knife in my hands. Then the ticking also started again downstairs. In an uneven rhythm the ticking was now coming from two places. \n\nAfter around ten minutes I thought I was going to scream, when the ticking suddenly stopped.\n\nAfter that there was nothing to be heard for almost an hour. Not being able to get a second of sleep, I started getting hungry. With the fear now slowly wearing off, I headed downstairs, with my knife of course. I put on the lights in the kitchen and jumped backwards.\n\nAt the end of the kitchen, where there had been a counter and some windows, there was now something I couldnât describe differently than a black void, consisting of nothing but darkness.\n\nBefore I could think much about what on earth this was, something jumped out of it. It was a creature as black as night itself. It was shaped a little like a human, but it was something completely different. It had pointy claws and razor sharp fangs. On its back were big, black wings. It emerged with a deafening growl.\n\nA second later I was screaming on the ground with this beast on top of me. In a reflex I had pointed my knife forwards when it appeared. Now my knife was deep down in its chest, at about the place where its heart should be, if it even had one.\n\nIt was trying to move, but it seemed like the knife had hit its target at a critical spot. It couldnât do much more than wiggle. With all my force I rolled it to my side. Still screaming I jumped upwards.\n\nNot long after the creature stopped moving. I had killed it, whatever the heck it was. Horrified and still shaking vibrantly I tried to gather myself and pulled the knife out of its chest.\n\nWas I going insane? Or had a winged, black demon really just appeared out of a black void in my kitchen in the middle of the night? I almost started laughing. That changed when I realized the void was still there and this was actually very, very real.\n\nI was wondering if more would come. Preparing, I took the biggest and sharpest kitchen knife I had. I barely had it in my hand, when the answer came. \n\nI heard a howl. Like that of a wolf, but deeper and darker. The sound reverberated through my bones. Moments later a big, wolf-like creature appeared. It was white and grey and much bigger than a wolf should be. Its back was lined with ice blue spikes. Its eyes were pitchblack. It didnât jump at me right away. It just stood there, looking at me like it was disappointed I was still alive. Slowly it approached me, with a low, soft growl. It seemed to be careful because of my knife.\n\nI growled back at the wolf.\n\nYes.\n\nI growled.\n\nNot that the wolf seemed to care though.\n\nI was ready to move, expecting the wolf to jump at any moment.\n\nIt didnât. What it did was way beyond what I expected.\n\nIt opened its mouth, and a black thing shot out with a tremendous speed. I jumped away, and the thing scratched my shoulder. I looked around and saw a black dagger in the wall while I felt my shoulder getting wet with blood. Not even a second later I felt claws digging into my back and only then did I realize my mistake.\n\nI had turned my back to the wolf.\n\nI had been so shocked by a dagger shooting out of its freaking mouth that I turned my back on the creature.\n\nThe wolf had taken its change and was now on my back, probably ready to snap my neck. I started screaming.\n\nThen things started getting even weirder.\n\nI heard a loud thud. The wolf got off me, distracted by whatever hit it.\n\nI turned around and saw an arrow pointing out of the wolfs neck. A second later a dagger hit its neck, an inch under the place were the arrow was still stuck. The wolf growled in pain, whereafter it soon collapsed and stopped breathing.\n\nCompletely in shock, I looked to my left, just in time to see a blue portal-like thing disappear behind a man. Or at least, it looked like a man. It probably wasn't, but that's besides the point. It was wearing a green cloak with golden lines. In its right hand he held a big wooden bow. At his hip was a dagger.\n\nâNever turn your back on themâ, the man said. \n\nBaffled and completly confused I just looked at him, not saying a word.\n\nâAre you just going to keep staring at me like Iâm the killer, or are you going to get up? Thereâs more coming you knowâ.\n\nâMore?â I asked, not completely surprised but still very scared.\n\nâYes, thatâs what I said. Or do you think theyâll make it this easy for you?â.\n\nâEasy?â.\n\nâYes, easy. Are you going to repeat everything I say?â.\n\nâRight, sorryâ, I said. Trying to gather my wits. âWait, how did you get in here in the first place?â\n\nâNot the right questionâ, the man said. âDo you want to die?â.\n\nâN, noâ, I answered, feeling slightly threatened.\n\nâThen get the frick up and get yourself together!â, the man said, irritated.\n\nHastily I stood up. The man took his dagger and handed it to me. âIâm Blythe, take thisâ.\n\nâWhere are these things coming from?â I asked.\n\nWhile opening his cloak to take a big, elf-like sword, he said. âThat's a better question, but still irrelevant. Besides, you wouldn't believe me even if I told you. What *is* relevant however is that the thing that left the letter for you wants you dead. Now that we killed 2 of his most valuable servants it will be most likely that he gets here himself to do the job. Also, he didnât really expect me to show up here, so he'll be extra pissed off. He hates me, you know. Heâll probably take this chance to kill both of us himsâ.\n\nHe didnât have time to finish his sentence. A deafening roar emerged from the void. I stumbled backwards, moved by the shockwaves. The man didnât budge.\n\nSeconds later, a black cloaked creature in the form of a man appeared. Again, it probably wasn't a man, but it kinda looked like it so, yeah. It had no clear face or anything. Just darkness. I could barely make out its lines against the blackness of the void.\n\nBlythe seemed to easily see him though. Before I could blink he had shot an arrow at the man, who reached out and catched the arrow just before it hit him.\n\nHe freaking catched the arrow, mid-air, just like that. I know Iâve already seen enough supernatural things tonight, but still, I was baffled.\n\nThe black man threw the arrow back, with more precision and speed than I've ever seen an arrow being shot with. Blythe already had his sword in hand and sliced the arrow in two. 'At least I didnât need to doubt his experience', I thought.\n\nThe black man shot his hand forward and darkness shot towards Blythe, who dodged it while making a roll towards the man. He lashed out with his sword. The man dodged and gave Blythe a punch in the gut, who bent over in pain. \n\nAll this time I was just standing there. I knew I had to do something, but what? I didnât even know what that thing could do, or what it was for that matter. Both beings were completely distracted, so I tried to close in.\n\nAnother punch followed. Before it hit Blythe he moved his sword. It slashed against the dark figure's hand, who screamed in pain. He opened his other hand and darkness surrounded Blythe's face, leaving him blinded. He slashed with his sword to protect himself. The dark creature pulled a black sword out of nothing, and stuck it into Blythe. It wasnât a full hit, because Blytheâs sword blocked it partially, but he was in severe pain nevertheless and he fell to the ground.\n\nI was almost behind the dark man, ready to stab him with my dagger, but he turned too fast. He was facing me. I was terrified beyond my darkest  imaginations. Looking into his eyes, or were his eyes must be, if he even had them, gave me the feeling I was already dead.\n\nHolding up my dagger, there wasnât much more I could do. Suddenly the creature moved its sword. It did it fast, I barely had time to register it. I still somehow managed to decently dodge it. It scraped against my belly.\n\nThen the being screamed. A second later a sword pierced trough its chest. Blythe was standing behind him. Seconds later, his sword turned into black powder and in shock he pulled his arm back.\n\nClearly in pain, but still alive, the dark creature turned and his hand shot towards Blytheâs gut. A black dagger was sticking out of Blythe's belly.\n\nI saw my chance.\n\nBefore Blythe fell to the ground, I lifted my dagger and slashed as hard and fast as I could, with all the strength I could muster. At the last moment, the creature started turning again, but it was too late. I chopped the head off.\n\nI literally chopped its head off.\n\nThe creatureâs headless body dropped to the ground, next to that of Blythe. \n\nI checked Blythe for a pulse, but he had none. He was gone.\n\nI sat on the ground. Totally exhausted and overwhelmed by all that had happened, I started crying. I had barely started however, before the bodies started to fade. Blythe, the dark man, the wolf and the winged creature. They all started to fade. Even the void started to slowly fade away, revealing my counter and kitchen windows, trough witch I could see that the sun had started to rise. \n\nAfter laying on the ground for a couple hours, crying and sleeping, I went upstairs. The envelope and letter had also faded away, and I had service again on my phone.\n\nItâs friday now, 15:08. This all happened last night. Iâm still extremely shocked and exhausted. It looks like it's all over now. I want to talk about it, but I donât dare to tell anyone, because who will take it for real?\n\nAll that's left are the wounds at my shoulder and belly. Even the dagger in the wall and Blythe's weapons had faded. I went to the hospital for my wounds , saying I had a fight. They didnât quite take it, but what should I have said?\n\nThis is the only place I feel like people will believe what happened to me, so, this is where Iâm posting. Thanks for reading my story. Take care.",

        "text": "I am a 74 year old woman with terminal brain cancer. The doctors say I have a few weeks left to live. My family tell me that in my last few weeks, I should get what i need to get off of my chest, they all knew something happened that day but their selfish selves cannot even comprehend the horror I went through that day.\n\nFor some context, it was the summer of 62, I was 29 years old and in the prime of my life. I spent everyday serving my husband and children, cleaning the house and preparing delicious meals. Some people may find this life boring and backwards, but i really did enjoy spending time at home with my kids. I loved my kids so much, I had 3, Natasha (10) William (6) and Ronald (2). Natasha was naturally very intelligent, she would always get grade As in every test. To me this wasnât a problem, but to my husband it was because he believed she should be focusing on domestic chores rather than school, to which i disagreed but I didnât speak up against him. He would also hate when William cried, saying he should âtoughen upâ. This behaviour from my husband was alittle bit odd though, because before heâd always encourage Natasha to work hard in school and heâd comfort William when he had an issue. I just assumed it must have been the stress from work, after all he did work very hard.\n\nIt was a humid evening in mid July, the sun was going down. I was getting dinner ready, it was a casserole which I had put a-lot of effort into making perfect for my husband, who was at work. My husband was a corporate lawyer, so heâd often come home late, and leave early so he could go to the gym. Dinner was ready, I called my kids to come down, but my husband still wasnât home. We decided to wait half an hour, until the kids got so hungry so I decided to let them eat. It was weird because he would usually be home by this time, but I reckoned it was a long case at work, which also happened sometimes. Another hour passed, still nothing. No call, no text. I decided to put the kids to sleep and go to my husbandâs office. I couldnât drive so I had to walk. It was about a 20 minute walk, the dark, mysterious aura of night was sending shivers down my spine. An extremely unpleasant sensation in my guy began to grow, but I ignored it and kept going. This was probably the biggest mistake I couldâve made.\n\nOnce i reached the office, i saw it was empty. In fact it even looked somewhat abandoned. I didnât know how to get in, I assumed it would have a security lock or something, but the door opened as soon as i turned the knob. I decided to explore a-bit. The whole place looked abandoned, hundreds of computers, files left open, the building itself looked like it was about to collapse. It was nothing like I remembered it from 2 years ago, all up to date and expensive. It now looked as if the huge building itself was about to collapse. The empty halls looked hauntingly back at me, i felt that I wasnt alone in there. But to me everything could still go back to normal, i could forget everything i just saw, until i entered my husbands office room.\n\nA letter, written in latin, read: I am going to take over. I am going to kill, succeed, ruin, dominate. Watch me. Watch m. Watch. Å´Ã¦tÃ§h. MÄ. What the hell did i just read? I started to say a prayer, in fear for my life all of a sudden. I wanted to ascend into heaven, for I felt that whatever was awaiting for me here was much worse than death. Then i saw it. In the corner of my eye, it looked me straight into my pupil. It was my husband, but it wasnât really him. It was some strange, shapeshifting creature pretending to be him. I tried to run but it got me. It talked to me. It talked about all the things it did to my husband, who i found out is dead and mutilated. It called my daughter names, it called my sons worthless. It called me weak, easy and pathetic. I guess it mustve been correct, because when it offered to let me go, but take my son i cowardly said yes. It took my son, my 2 year old boy. âThe younger the betterâ. \n\nAfter this, my other kids refuse to talk to me. They to this day have ptsd issues, my daughter even ended up taking her own life 30 years ago. There was no sign of âmy husbandâ after that day, everyone thought i killed my baby and my husband, but i didnt. It wasnt me it was that skin taking creature! \n\nNow everyone is wanting me to confess to this âdouble homicideâ, but thats not what worries me, i dont care about that anymore. I remembered something else. It told me i would return to it when i die. I dont know how to feel. I am terrified. I cant be saved anymore.",

        "text": "Iâve never been what people consider to be religious.  My folks never forced on me the monotony of church, temple, worship, or whatever the hell else you want to call the thing people do when they gather together and praise some god.  I love it that way, too.  Sundays are the best days for sleeping in.\n\nBecause of this, I could never find myself believing in any divine deity.  The tenets of pastafarianism were my greatest pull to religion, simply due to how hilarious and absurd the ideals were.  If I were to consider any religion, the satirical nature of pastafarianism would be the only one to satisfy my own cynicism related to every other religion.  The Flying Spaghetti Monster above all others would be my savior!\n\nBecause of this, real religion was not something I ever found myself concerning.  I regularly blaspheme, often saying things like âoh my godâ and âjesus christ.â  I also frequently say things like âIâll see you in Hell!â to my friends and get replies like âIâll have a seat saved for ya!â All of this on top of even more frequent swearing.\n\nI donât think Iâm a bad person.  I still like to believe I have the right morals, but I just couldnât ever find myself ever believing in the big man in the sky who punishes any sin while also claiming to love me beyond my own imagining.\n\nIf you ask me, Mary was a common whore who claimed God got her pregnant to save herself from being stoned to death or whatever.  Her son was just a narcissist, too absorbed in his own âholinessâ to see that his mother just did it with some rando, and he further claimed to be the son of God on top of this.\n\nItâs all just so fucking stupid that anyone can really believe that bullshit they preach in church in this day and age.\n\nI might believe it now though.  You see, Iâve had my share of experiences in the past.  I had my phases of experimentation while I was in college.  I had done some acid in my day on top of the daily shot and bong rip.  I also did some harder stuff at times (DMT, coke, shots of Everclear not just vodka), but those things were pretty much only done once or twice.  I tried to avoid that harder, more dangerous stuff.\n\nBut those days are behind me, and I never shied away from talking about it.  Itâs part of my history, after all, and Iâm not ashamed of my poor behavior.  I fought to become better, getting myself a good job, a wife, a house of our own, I never lost my family through my antics so I was always close with them.  Itâs just my history, and Iâve accepted it as my own.\n\nWhat I recently went through was very different from anything like that, though.  You see, I was recently pronounced dead.  Not very long ago, actually.  As a matter of fact it was thirty seconds ago.  I was in a car crash, having gotten T-boned by some drunk idiot who ran a red light from my left hitting my Civicâs driver side door at fifty miles an hour.  Iâve been a drunk idiot before, but never one who was behind the wheel.  Luckily I was smart enough to keep myself and my friends from doing that.\n\nBut I digress, because I suffered at that anyway.  The hospital had done all they could, but recently I regained consciousness in a different way than waking up from a normal accident.  Iâd heard that before death you experience dream-like hallucinations similar to a DMT trip.  Your brain produces it while dreaming, after all, albeit in miniscule doses, and this is said to be what the âmy life flashed before my eyesâ talk might all be about.\n\nI preface with all this history about me because I *know* this was *not* a DMT trip induced by death.  I had done that, and this was different.  It felt even more real than the false reality created by DMT.  This actually felt more real than real.  I stood as a naked soul in the empty blankness of everything.  I looked around and saw nothing for all eternity.\n\nVery slowly, the void changed as color returned to my vision.  This new existence faded into the world around me and I could begin making out shapes.  It looked like a chair, actually thereâs two of them.  And a small table between them.\n\nThere's two bookshelves on one side of this room with a gap between them, where I can now begin to distinguish its boundaries.  The walls are forming, and I can also see a bartop across from the bookshelf.\n\nEventually the room has entirely faded into view, and I donât need to squint to see any of the shapes.  The bookshelves are painted a dark grey, with an innumerable amount of dark red leather bound books.  They are all identical with no indication of what any of the books are named.  Between them in the gap is a large porcelain bust raised to just about head height, of who it is I do not know.\n\nThe two lounge chairs in the middle of the room are matching all of the books, bound in the same maroon leather.  They look pretty comfortable and sophisticated.  The table between is glass, with two coasters on either side in front of the seats and an ashtray in the middle.\n\nThe bar is beautiful.  Hundreds of bottles line the back wall with mirrors behind them.  The seats are padded and high, again matching the dark grey and maroon color theme.  Behind the bar also appears to be a humidor, with several boxes inside most likely containing cigars.\n\nThe wall dividing these sets of decoration was also large in size.  Two tall windows with dark red drapes lay in the middle of the wall, which had some grey victorian-style wallpaper on it.  The pattern repeated endlessly, swirling and moving into every direction, each section of the pattern joining back with duplicates of itself over and over again.\n\nWhen Iâm first able to see anything, I feel something is off.  It immediately looks like somewhere Iâd like to be, cozy and fancy.  But something is wrong here.  I canât put my finger on it, but it feels eerie.  Something is definitely weird.\n\nWhile Iâm in the middle of trying to figure this out, I hear a knocking behind me.  I hadnât turned to explore the rest of the room, but a door is there on the wall I hadnât seen.  It was the same as the other, but no windows and drapes, just a dark red door.  I stand in confusion, but the knocking returns once more.  I suddenly feel like Iâm in *The Raven*, and that might be why I feel off.  But I open the door, and to my surprise (which is counterintuitive, thanks Poe), I find someone at the door.\n\nIt is a fairly tall caucasian man wearing a matching dark grey suit and maroon tie.  He looks very professional, and this room is most definitely his.  He stands there with his hands behind him and his shoulders back, chest as high as one could possibly get it.  Behind him is nothing.\n\nThe endless void of black I saw before coming into the room is the only thing that exists beyond the doorway.  The man is standing in empty space like I was, and from the outside it looks funny because his feet are in the perfect position to prove heâs standing on some solid surface, but he clearly isn't.\n\nâMay I join you?â he says very formally.\n\nâUh, sure,â I reply, not seeming like itâs my place to invite guests inside.  Like I said, itâs obviously his room, so Iâm not so sure why heâs asking to come in himself.\n\nHe walks in and meanders over to the bar, grabs a bottle of deep red wine and a glass hanging from the ceiling, and begins to pour himself a glass.  âLike pinot noir?â he says to me.\n\nâI do,â I reply, trying to exchange the same pleasantries with which he addressed me.  âBut I prefer scotch if you have any.â\n\nâWhatâll it be?â  He seems to only speak in questions.\n\nâYou got Lagavulin?â I say.  At most bars they laugh at you for questions like this, but this place seemed like the best chance of having the answer to that question be âyes.â\n\nHe reaches back, finds the sixteen year everyone loves so much, and begins to pour it into a little glencairn glass.  He knows my style, and for the moment Iâm here for it.\n\nâCigar?â he asks, further proving my conjecture.\n\nâI love a Davidoff,â of which he manages to pull from the humidor, and hands me a cigar cutter and mini torch.  He gestures to the seats for me to take one, so I wander back over and sit on the side closest to the bar, facing the bookshelves and the bust.  Now I see it is of the man who just walked in.  I wondered about his narcissism, but then I thought about my own drink and cigar order, and humbled myself.\n\nHe takes the seat opposite me with his wine and lights a cigarette of his own.  If Iâd known this man at all, Iâd call this a perfect Saturday night with one of the boys.  Instead it felt wrong, intrusive, and maybe even dangerous.  What did I do to deserve this sense of luxury?  It seems unwarranted and unearned, maybe a false sense of security.\n\nâMy name is Lucifer,â he says very coolly, like anybody could be named that.  It stung a bit to hear, but I had been asking myself since I arrived âwhat the hell is this place?â  I remember dying, that much is true.  Was it heaven, hell, or something in between?  I had been pondering things like this since I arrived, and it seemed like a very real possibility that this *was* the Devil.  He matched the place, but without that context heâd definitely look sinister in that suit.\n\nâJoshua,â I reply, trying to sound cool and not at all frightened.\n\nHe laughs at this.  âI know who you are, dummy,â he says, very friendly.  My instincts are pulling me in both directions.  Is he a friend, or is he actually Satan?  âBut do you know who you are?â he asks this with his head down and his voice a bit deeper.  He raises his eyes back to me looking for a response.\n\nI hold firm, but confused.  I just told him who I was.  At this he bellowed, a great hearty laugh as he leaned back and grabbed his abdomen.  âYour face!â he said through his laughter.  At this point Iâm just lost.\n\nâWhat is this place?â I ask when he regains enough composure to be able to hear me.\n\nâOh this little spot?â he asks with some playfulness.  âItâs just a place to flop.  You like it?â\n\nâI actually love it here,â I say, finding some sense of casual banter.  âI would kill for a place like this in my house.â\n\nâCareful with those words,â he says, wiggling his finger at me.  âI could give you this for that, you know.â  When he says this I realize the error in my choice of words.  People make deals with the devil, and Iâd hate to accidentally do something stupid like that again.\n\nâWhat are we doing here?â I ask him.\n\nâI just want to talk to you,â he said, again very coolly and friendly.  âIâm in a bit of a good mood today and I want to offer you something.â\n\nWell this canât be good.  I immediately donât want to make any deals here, but he intrigues me with his next sentence, probably why so many people are easily seduced by him.\n\nâI want to give you a chance to earn back your life.  For this is purgatory, and while you have been given to me, I have not taken you to the place you call Hell just yet.â\n\nâWhatâs the catch?â I ask him, knowing there must be one.\n\nâAinât no catch,â he says.  âJust a condition that must be met.  If you fail to meet it, you will come with me to the depths of all that is unholy, as originally intended.â\n\nâAnd if I meet these conditions?â  I find myself remaining impressively calm throughout this discussion.  He scares me, as he should, but so far heâs done naught to hurt me, and I canât help but feel his sincerity.\n\nâYou might have felt like youâve been here for quite a while,â he begins to say, âbut at the moment you are still in a hospital bed trying to be saved.  Barely an instant has gone by on that side since youâve passed over to this one.  If you meet my condition, I will send you back to that other side.  There the doctors can claim they âsaved youâ or âbrought you back to lifeâ or whatever they will want to say to boost their own ego.â\n\nHe says this last bit with some sarcasm, and it actually makes me smirk.  âOk, but what is the condition I need to meet?â\n\nâBring meâ¦ a shrubbery!â\n\nOkay I admit I almost had Lagavulin come out my nose.  He said this like the Knights of Ni from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*.  I burst out laughing, as did he.\n\nâThis is a lie, of course.  That is *not* the condition that must be met.â\n\nOnce I regain my breath, I ask, âThen what is the condition?â\n\nâ*Write me a riddle that I cannot answer.*â\n\nI sit here and look at him for a moment.  This time his face is serious.  I am flooded with questions when I see that this is the actual task.  âHow long do I have?â\n\nâAs much time as you want.  Iâll send you back to the hospital as soon as you have one.  Remember, time is not a factor in this room.â\n\nâHow many chances do I have?â\n\nâIâll give you three, asking you to make each question an official guess before you ask me, in the chance you need to think aloud when Iâm about.â\n\nâAre there any things I cannot ask?â\n\nâAnything is possible.  All questions are riddles; whether I can answer them or not is all that matters.â\n\nâHow much do you know?â  I wondered if heâd understand what I meant by this, but he answered in the way I needed him to.\n\nâI am just as all-knowing as the one you call âGod,â and almost as powerful.â\n\nâAlmost?â\n\nThis he did not answer, only gave me a look.  âYou will remain in this room for as long as you need.  The bottles will never empty, the books will always show what you think to read, the cigars will never reach your fingers, and the padding will never tear.  You have an eternity to complete this task.â\n\nâAnd what if I choose not to play?  Take an infinite amount of time here and just enjoy the luxury youâve given me?â  I asked this looking for a loophole.  This place is right up my alley, and I wouldnât mind spending eternity here if I can just drink and smoke and read.\n\nâThen that would be just as you said: not playing the game.  Only if you really try will I let you keep this room to yourself.  If you stop playing, and Iâll know if you do or not, youâll come with me down, down, downward until there is nowhere else to go!â\n\nI stare at him.  My choice is Hell, or play this little game that also seems to have no road to victory.  I sat in silence, and Lucifer took this as his dismissal.\n\nHe puts down his glass on the table, and he begins to stand up.  He heads to the door and I can do nothing but sit here and stare at him.  âI really do want you to win,â he says, pausing in the open doorway.  âLike I said, Iâm in a good mood.â  And with this he shut the door and left me by myself.\n\nIf he wanted me to keep living, why give me such an impossible task?  What am I supposed to say to stump someone who is all-knowing?  My mind is flooded once more with questions of âwhat could I possibly doâ and âhow could I get out of here.â\n\nWhere am I supposed to begin?\n\nOnce I was alone in the room I was just kind of stuck in place.  I stared at the door for what felt like at least a few minutes, and I could not find myself moving around much apart from breathing.  I did not know where to start with these riddles.  I had not the slightest idea of how to approach this.\n\nWhere I did know to start was the bottle of Lagavulin left on the bar.  I set out to see if it was true that these bottles never emptied.  I brought it back to the comfy maroon leather chair and refilled my glass.  It seemed true that the bottle was stuck at three-quarters full.  Who had emptied it this far I wondered only for a moment.\n\nI also kept puffing on my cigar, and it never burned away.  I went and pulled one of the many identical books from the shelf and thought of the first book I could before opening it.  Sure enough, it read âIt was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.â  *1984* by George Orwell.\n\nI closed it quickly and put it back on the shelf.  I thought of another book and went to grab a random one from the other side.  When I opened it, it read âEveryone my age remembers where they were and what they were doing when they first heard about the contest.â  *Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline.\n\nThis place was weird.\n\nI figured while I was here in these luxuries I would divulge some sweet private time.  I downed my glass and refilled it once more.  I was gonna get comfortably drunk, sit here with my cigar, and read something to entertain myself.  If I was gonna be here for an eternity, I could start by enjoying myself.\n\nAnother book, of which I opened to âOnce upon a midnight dreary,â was the best thing to be reading in this place.  My thoughts from before made this especially terrifying, and my mind was haunted.  I finished my glass once more to rid myself of these unnecessary fears.  Now perfectly buzzed and my mind feeling more open and free, I sat down to think of all I knew about riddles.\n\nTurns out I donât know squat.\n\nThe best I had was *Riddles in the Dark*, one of the most important chapters of all Tolkienâs work.  I grabbed a book and opened it.  âIn a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit.â  Probably my favorite opening to any story, but then again, I was a massive fan.  I fanned through until I got to chapter five.  I read it through once, then again, and another time.  It is such a fun, but very tense, story all on its own.\n\nI found a pen near the bookshelves and opened a random book once more.  I had not been thinking of a title to give this book, and it opened blankly.  I wrote down every riddle on the paper and its answer.  I looked at them hard, trying to dissect them.\n\nEach riddle had not only an answer, but the answers were things people knew about.  Most answers were very literal, like eggs or wind or time.  These types of riddles would not at all leave the Devil himself clueless.  The best chance I had was to come up with a riddle similar to the one that ended the game between Bilbo and Gollum.\n\nâWhat have I got in my pocket?â\n\nThis is debated within the story itself as being an unfair riddle.  While it could be true, and certainly argued either way, it was the best chance Iâd have to beat this game.  Iâd need an unfair advantage.\n\nI thought in silence for a very long time.  I recounted in my head all I could from my experience with him in the room.  I thought aloud each sentence he spoke that I could remember, and one stood out to me above all the others:\n\nâAnything is possible.  All questions are riddles; whether I can answer them or not is all that matters.â\n\n*Anything is possible*.\n\nQuickly into my head it jumped, a question I thought I could ask him.  I looked around, and I realized I had no idea how to get his attention.  I looked around the room, trying to see if he was hiding somewhere in here but he wasnât.  So I went and grabbed the doorknob, which I could not turn.  I banged on it a couple of times and I heard him knock back at me.\n\nIt scared me, and I instinctively backed away.  As I did he opened the door and reentered from the blackness.  âHave you got something already?  Itâs not been very long.â\n\nâYou said time doesnât pass in here anyway.â I retorted with confidence.\n\nâQuite right,â he said, looking far and away with some thought.  âWhat do you have?â he said, returning his gaze back to me, and walking over to his chair where his wine still was.\n\nâAn official attempt.â\n\nâOoooh goody!â he said while clapping and rubbing his hands together.  What the hellâs wrong with this dude?  I canât figure out if heâs evil or just like any other guy.  âOff you go, then!â\n\nI swallowed, and prepared my first riddle.  âIf anything is possible, is it possible for something to be *impossible*?â\n\nâOh, I like that one,â he said with absolute sincerity.  I wondered if Iâd had him.  âParadoxes are marvelous human inventions in an attempt to explain what they cannot understand.  Their puny limits keep them locked up, and their perspective fails.â\n\nI stood here a moment.  That wasnât an answer, so I was lost.  He saw my confusion and returned to me.  âImpossibility being a possibility is, in and of itself, a possibility.  That means it is no guarantee that it is impossible, and therefore, is possible.  The answer is no; impossibility is not a possibility.â\n\nMy brain hurts.  Also, âpossibleâ is no longer sounding like a real word.\n\nâIâll give you a hint, though, because I like that question a lot.â  I remained quiet and waited for Lucifer to continue.  âEven if the answer was yes, it would have been answerable.  My condition is for you to write a riddle I cannot answer.  Keep that in mind.â\n\nHe began to get back up and make his way to the door.  âYou have two more tries.  Make them worth it.â  He shut the door behind him.\n\nAs soon as the door shut, I quickly turned back and got myself the paper and pen to write down exactly what he just said.  Every word from his mouth could be used against him, especially the hint he gave me.  I sat back down and stared at what I just wrote, thinking about it all while it was still clear and recent in my head.\n\nI sat back and continued thinking.  Paradoxes and contradictions might be unanswerable to humans, but he clearly had some kind of workaround.  He even put it in terms that I could almost understand, and I tried to work it out in my head, to no avail.\n\nI had to start new.  The best thing I had was to still make something unfair.  If I had an unfair question, Iâd get him.\n\nBecause I had to start fresh, and because I felt like I couldnât utilize the magic books properly, I spent tons of time in here just being bored and thinking to myself.  Drinking, smoking, and reading about things that had nothing to do with riddles or philosophy was fun, but unproductive.  I knew nothing about these things, much less book titles to help me learn about them or how to make them.\n\nAt one point I had removed all the bottles from the barback and looked at myself in the mirror.  I just stared, out of boredom and drunkenness.  I hoped Iâd find some inner monologue to help me.  It was here I thought Iâd have another advantage if there was weed in this room.\n\nThe super creative, but ultimately stupid, questions people ask while theyâre high can sometimes actually be super insightful.  I wondered if it would help me at all, but there was none in here.  Iâd have to stick with the booze.\n\nAs I sat here staring, drunk and a bit wobbly, I was finally struck by another question.  In my drunken haste, I banged on the door again asking for Lucifer to come back.  I might have even called for âLucyâ at one point, but I was in a daze and couldnât confirm that.\n\nHe came back in and sat down quietly.  âBeen partaking enough?â he asked.\n\nâI bet Iâd drink you under this table,â I said with a hiccup.\n\nLucifer chuckled.  âI bet you could,â he said, entertaining me with this, and probably himself.  âDo you have an official guess?â\n\nâYesh Iâd like to ask you now,â I slurred.\n\nâIntrigue me.â\n\nâWhat color,â I said, pointing at him with a flimsy arm, âis a mirror?â  I smiled at myself.  âHuh?  Thatâs a good one too!â\n\nThe Devil looked disappointed, and he shook his head quietly.  âNo, Joshua, why did you ask me that?â  I was confused, not because I was drunk, but about why he was answering that way.  âYou understand thereâs two answers to that, right?â\n\nâWhat do you mean?â\n\nâPhilosophically, the mirror is whatever color you see.  If you see yourself, it is âyouâ colored.  If you see a blue wall, itâs blue.  Now scientifically, if you put two mirrors parallel to each other and look inside, it tints itself green as light is absorbed, making it *literally* a bit green in hue.â\n\nMy drunk mind was trying to comprehend, but I had seen parallel mirrors and the green tint before, and I didnât think of this until he mentioned it.  âOh, shit.â\n\nâYou still have one more attempt.  Maybe lay off the alcohol a bit and rethink everything,â he said with some care, as he began to head back towards the door.\n\nâWell what am I supposed to ask a guy, who says he knows everything, a question where he doesnât know the answer?â I say quickly, and with some slurring throughout.  My tongue is very loose from all the scotch.\n\nâIs this official?â he says to me.\n\nâ...What?â\n\nâIs that an official attempt?  You asked me a question.â\n\nThe gears in my head start cranking.  Rust popped off in all regions of my brain and it began to fire with quick and heavy thought.  It felt like all the alcohol in my bloodstream vanished!  I respoke the sentence in my head.  Yes!  Of course he wouldnât know that answer!  He himself cannot possibly know what he doesnât know if he thinks he knows all!\n\nBut wait, is this another paradox?  It sounds like it is, and I try my damndest to decipher this.  Iâm still wasted, after all.  It sounds like it might be, but if he canât answer, then I win.  He could refute, but I thought of the right response for this if he did.  It was my only shot, and I went for it.\n\nâYes, official guess.  What can I ask you that you do not know the answer to?â\n\nHe smiled.  âCertainly you donât believe there is an answer to this question?â\n\nâThen answer it!â\n\nâThere are many things you could ask me that I could not answer.  That is my answer! Do you deserve to know them?  You just lost the game, so I think not.â\n\nâIf I can hear one, Iâll know Iâm wrong.â  My confidence was high.  He was avoiding an explicit example.  Yes, I had him now.  He looked at me, and I stared back.\n\nHis look changed in an instant.  At first he looked at me as if heâd won the game, and felt sympathy for me for guessing so quickly.  It looked like he felt bad, like he really didnât want to take me to Hell, but had to anyway.\n\nThen, it changed immediately into a face worthy of the name Lucifer.  He turned bright red, and grew in stature, tearing his suit away from his body, screaming in hatred while he did so.  His muscles grew and his legs turned into those of a goat.  Horns jumped from his head and great wings sprouted on his back.  Huge canine teeth came shooting out of his gums as his face took on something beastly and otherworldly.  The room disappeared back into the void as he grew too large for it, and his energy diminished all that was around.\n\nHe roared as he spoke to me, his voice deep and demonic.  âYou have not gotten the final laugh, pitiful human!  You were sent to me for a reason!  You will be back, and then it will be for all eternity!  You will suffer by my hands, your fate has been sealed by your own!  Begone, foul pest, for I cannot bear to gaze upon your wretched form!  When we meet again, I will rid you of it and give you pain and fire!  This is not the end, and when we reach it then I will be laughing!  Away with you!â\n\nHe swiped his humongous red hand at me, and it hit me square in the torso with his nails cutting into my flesh.  I was sent flying through the dark, empty void at a speed incalculable.  I traversed all of everything for a time I felt could not exist.  Forever I flew through nothing untilâ¦\n\nMy eyes opened slowly.  I had a bright light shining directly into my face.  A tube was coming out of my mouth and I could feel it down my throat.  My muscles could not move, and I was sore pretty much everywhere.  I heard the faint voices of people around me, the only thing I could make out was âHeâs back, quickly everyone back to work!â  I mustâve been given more medicine even though I was alive again, because I promptly fell back asleep.\n\nWhen I awoke properly, I was still in a hospital bed, but in my own private room.  My arms were casted and elevated, and my body was wrapped in bandages.  I couldnât move a thing, especially not the left leg that I could not find attached to my hip.  I was in bad shape, but I was alive, and I cried for a long while.\n\nEventually the doctors came in to inform me of the accident.  I remembered quite a bit, as my body had taken much of the brunt of the collision versus my head.  I blacked out when it happened, but I remember being in the hospital under emergency care before fading into death and reawakening in the void.\n\nNot to my surprise, the doctors told me this experience was likely part of the hallucinations people have upon that stage of injury.  I nodded my head and went along.  It hurt to even nod my head.  I lay here quietly by myself for a while before my wife came in crying her eyes out.  Even she would fail to believe what I went through.\n\nI donât know about you, but those last few moments with Lucifer were horrifying.  I could not express my fear, and I can only now recount what happened by just telling you what I saw.  The feeling.  That was petrifying.  I cannot face him again.  If I do, I will know what true suffering is like.  He did keep his word, though.  He did give me my life back.  To this day, I am conflicted.  If Lucifer was so evil in the end, why did he give me a gift?  Why did he show me love before his evil?\n\nHe also told me that I was sent to him for a reason.  That much must be true, but I could change that.  I struggle to know if I can though.  Because I was so frightened of the Devil, how could I possibly face Godâs judgment?  His wrath is beyond even Luciferâs.  What can I do to find Godâs love?  Will he show me his evil before his love, like Satan?\n\nDo I even want to find Godâs love if it is more terrifying than the Devil himself?",

        "text": "Once, I actually was a pretty normal human, I had dreams, future plans and a fiance, I was young. Nineteen years old, fresh out of high school, and had plans to go to college and move in with my now dead wife. Now, nearly 34 years later, i'm a completely different person. It really all started back in my home town of Whipster, Oregon. I was 18 years old about to graduate high school, I was still living with my parents until my house was done being built so I could live with my at the time girlfriend.\n\nI was interested in joining the military but I was mainly interested in guns, that was going to be my major in college, ballistics, and developing new kinds of assault rifles. After a long debate and argument with my girlfriend and parents I was going to join the armed forces, or as they called it, \"Special Armed Military Tactical Team.\" I didn't really know what they meant by \"special\" but my young mind was ready. Man I wish I listened to my parents and my gut feeling and never thought about joining this unit for the government. Worst decision I ever made, but, maybe I was meant for this.\n\nI did need the money to pay for college and pay off the rest of the house, they were willing to pay a lot more money for this special unit than regular armed forces. The very first day of training was absolutely horrible, to say the least. It was in the middle of nowhere in Arizona, right in the middle of a desert. They said this kind of training was absolutely needed for this job, and that training in the desert was perfect. It was pretty normal in 105 degree weather, except when we got to the shooting range, instead of there being normal human cardboard people to shoot at, they were these massive plastic and cardboard representations of creatures I have never seen before.\n\nThere were 330 of us, split into groups of 10 for training, the training would last about 15 weeks, which I found extremely odd as you would normally go through six weeks of training for a military job. Instead of getting easier, the training got progressively harder as the days went on. The cardboard creatures were also getting more and more deformed and terrifying. We also weren't allowed to tell anyone about our training or really just the job in general, really all we could tell was our family.\n\nThe first few weeks of training was hard, but it wasn't nothing we couldn't handle, but the last few weeks were the worst. After week ten we started practicing our aim on moving life animals, honestly I wouldn't even call them animals. They are some deformed mutated creatures, not even like they were from this world. After the first day of training with those things about 21 people quit the training over being traumatized about killing those monsters, really it's the only word I could use to describe them. They ranged from dog sized to human sized, some of them didn't even have eyes and would move around until it was shot by one of us.\n\nWhat really made people quit though was we had to practice with this shape-shifter, the creatures would turn into our beloved family and friends, which was part of the training. To become desensitized toward the creatures, and not fall for their tricks. After week ten was over I started to make new friends, one of them named Bobby, an amazing person, we became best friends overnight and now he's really the only one I trust at this place, or so i thought.\n\nWeek eleven and twelve were okay, I met two guys Conner and Moses, they were both brothers, so, me, Bobby, Conner and Moses very quickly bonded and we all became best friends. When we went into week thirteen all of us thought we were ready for anything they would throw at us after going through all that. obviously, We were not prepared, honestly, no one from this planet would be prepared for these last few weeks of training we had ahead of us.\n\nMoses had told me after week twelve, the real training started. We stopped doing cardio exercises all together and focused on shape-shifter training. After that we started using these super big guns. I have never seen any kind of weaponry like this, ever. this one gun was huge, it was almost two AK-47s put together, and don't even get me started on the recoil and kick these fuckers had. After shooting it once everyone could barely move their arm. Allison, one of our commanders shot it without experiencing too much pain to show it can be used without breaking your shoulder. My question was, what kind of creatures would need this powerful of a gun to be killed?\n\nWeek thirteen and fourteen mainly consisted of using that gun, and doing shape-shifter training. week fifteen though, i'll never forget this week, It was one of the most difficult and horrifying training i'd ever went through, the first day, they brought these giant humanoid creatures and we had to kill them before they got to us. The next three days after that they made us shoot the big gun three times an hour for the whole day. The last days were the worst, They put us in this room with this eight foot tall creature and we had to kill it before it killed us. Honestly out of the hundreds of thoughts about quitting this program this time was the closest.\n\nThat thing, was horrifying, the arms were the size of two people put together and it was only eight feet tall so its arms had to drag across the floor when it wasn't trying to claw my eyes out. It's head was so long it could barely keep it straight. The last day was the worst, I had to kill one more of those creatures in that room all alone to finish the day, I was handed a gun and placed in the room. It immediately charged at me and I fired the gun but that damn recoil was so bad it barely got the top of its head. Green Juice splashed everywhere but it was coming toward me I only had one of those big guns so the reload was bad, and nothing else to use, I tried to dodge its arms but it got a hold of me, still spewing green.\n\nIt was just about to rip me apart until Allison blew it's head off, I dropped to the ground, absolutely paralyzed from fear of almost getting killed by one of those things, everyone else seemed pretty calm, might be because we was all shocked about what just happened. Eventually I got patched up, and the fifteen week training course was over, after 2 weeks they would cut most people and it would go down to 150. the selected people would then go on to two more weeks of specialized training and at that point after the two weeks there would only be 100 people left. I was honestly hoping they wouldn't pick me but I had two more weeks to go home and clear my mind of everything for now.\n\nI will update y'all on my adventures I once had, but this part was only for training, part two will be about the actual job, I would rather call it hell, but, I better get off here for now.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10mied4/my_mothers_death_went_viral_on_shock_sites_and_i/",
        "text": "It wasn't one of those \"typical mother deaths\" you would often hear about like cancer or some sort of terminal illness. She flew through the windshield of the family's Honda Civic and landed in the middle of the opposing lane. The nearby SUV had a dashcam, and apparently her airtime was around eight seconds. \n\nThe dashcam video of her death has been passed around gore forums and shock sites since the October it happened, October 2022, and as of writing this (27 January 2023), it has been three months.\n\nThe first response my family issued to the accident was that it was the family's 'Butterknife', which is what my late maternal grandmother called what is widely known as a 'family curse'. She called it that because her mother died from a wound suffered from a butterknife. It was unlikely, almost impossible, but it happened. And that's what happened to all of my female (maternal) ancestors, they all died odd deaths in adulthood. Only after they had given birth to a child. The firstborn would always be female, and it is this child that would receive the Family Butterknife. \n\nIt was a miracle in my family when I, the firstborn, was born male. And so were my two siblings, both of them are male. It was like the butterknife curse was over. \n\nBut it wasn't. \n\nYou may think, 'if the curse is so prominent in your family, why didn't your ancestors just not have children?'. The universe had a way of solving that one. It's the reason why my mother never had a father figure growing up.\n\nMy family found solace in me, being a symbol of hope in the midst of an existential turmoil. I carried the emotional burden, being watched carefully in my every move yet not being allowed to speak up about it. Everything I said was taken so intensely serious, every joke missed and was analysed to the point that it was no longer a joke but a swing at the family and my ancestors. I'd say at the dinner table,\n\n\"This lamb is amazing! Too bad you don't like it.\" It's not funny but it was always an attempt to lighten the mood. Everybody incessantly wore these drab faces, as if they were always in mourning for people long gone. \n\nEspecially Mum. I'm sure she felt like some sort of ticking time bomb, just ready to die at any moment. It must have been agony to not know whether she'd die by the Family Butterknife, and if she did, what the cause would be. As her children were almost grown up, she knew it wasn't long before she would find out. \n\n\"Your father spent so long making this lamb. Your grandmother would be rolling in her grave if she heard how ungrateful you sound.\" Mum would say. She was such a sweet mother, so nurturing and loving, but if you said the wrong thing she could really turn ugly. \n\n\"No no, I was just cheering you guys up. You look so sad.\" I'd respond light-heartedly. \n\n\"Excuse me?\" \n\nOf course now I'd kill to hear her say that to me, even if it made me feel horrible. \n\nWe knew the Butterknife was close when she started acting strangely. She'd sleepwalk and waft into my room in my deepest sleep. I wouldn't even know she was there until morning. She'd also experience these senseless hallucinations, most having to do with cars. We would never let her drive alone after she told us that, but she flew under our radar eventually. She'd also have this delusion about pool tables and pool balls or whatever. \n\n\"Sammy?\" she cried to the thick air above the staircase, inching towards my bedroom. \n\n\"Yes?\" I'd respond.\n\n\"Come here!\" \n\nI softly stepped down the stairs and followed her voice into the kitchen. She stood before the open kitchen cabinet. It was completely empty. \n\n\"Explain this.\" she said coldly. \n\n\"Explain what?\"\n\n\"Don't be smart. Where did my billiard balls go? Your father and I need these for pool.\" \n\n\"We don't have a pool table.\" \n\n\"Of course we do. Now, where did you put them?\"\n\n\"Mum, I don't have them.\" I said slowly, sounding out my syllables. \n\n\"Ah, found one!\" she said, ducked down quick enough that it looked like her puffy hair floated down out of sync, and picked up an invisible object.\n\n\"Where are the others, Sammy?\" she said restlessly, tapping her foot.\n\n\"I don't have them, Mum.\" \n\n\"THEN WHERE THE FUCK ARE THEY?\" she bellowed and threw the invisible object at me. She violently flinched and her face turned sorrowful as she creeped towards me, tirelessly apologising for hurting me.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Sammy, I didn't mean it. I've just been really stressed lately.\" she sobbed, kissing and rubbing the spot on my forehead I assume she thought she hit when she threw the billiard ball.  \n\n\"It's okay, Mum. It didn't even hurt.\" Not physically.\n\nMy father took her to various psychiatric hospitals, but she'd either be refused entry for some unforsaken reason or be let out in less than a week. It was hopeless. At this point, the whole family was praying for her to die without pain. \n\nI woke up on that nameless day in October at midday, with a more-than-usual amount of notifications on my phone. A lot more. Exactly seventy-three more than the usual one notification I get in the morning. A lot of apologies, people reaching out to schedule events, people asking for permission to come over to my house. My father and two brothers weren't in the house, so I woke up completely clueless and yearning for answers. I think they thought that I would handle the news better if I was well-rested. They even turned off my alarm to prolong my sleep.\n\nI miss her so much.\n\nShe wanted an open casket funeral, but what the people scraped off of the concrete could only be cremated or put in a jar and buried. We still respected her wishes, and what lay instead of her peaceful corpse in the coffin was a little rose-gold urn, the size of a Christmas mug. \n\nAt the beginning of the month, a video popped up on my feed on Reddit. A woman flew out of the front of a car on a busy highway and landed in front of a speeding trailer car. I was subscribed to some questionable subreddits, so these kind of posts were not unnatural for me, but I knew immediately that it was my mother in the video. I knew it was an infamous shock video because it had about a million trademarks and website names burned into the corners, and had the quality of a Plasma TV left on the kids channel for a week. \n\nI opened the comments and all of them were making jokes about her. The way she flew, how far she flew, and what she was wearing. I was immediately blinded by my thick tears shooting from my eyes. I hadn't even felt upset at first, it was just instinct to immediately cry so I can get it over with when the full impact of the video would hit me later. \n\nA few weeks later, close to now, is when my brothers and I started seeing the visions. Every time, during random intervals during the day, we'd all collectively see a stark forest swaying under the overcast sky.\n\nIt was haunting, like something was in the shadows between the thin trees, just watching as we stood before it, waiting for the vision to end. It was nothing like mother's eccentric hallucinations and visions; extreme and packed full of rich and unending information. It was just a forest. \n\n\"What do you think it is?\" I said dryly, sat on a secondhand rattan chair on my parents' porch, to my brothers in front of me. This was after the third vision we all had, at that time we were compelled enough to talk to each other about it. \n\n\"I hope it's not what I think it is.\" Julian, the youngest, said after a drag of the slim cigarette fastened between his thumb and pointer finger.\n\n\"It's only a female thing. We know that.\" said Francis, the middle. \n\n\"*Who* knows?\"\n\nWe sat in silence around the wisps of cigarette smoke flying into the air, maybe to where people go when they die. Maybe the cigarette smoke goes to where Mum is now. I just want to get on a monorail-shaped wisp and fly up and see Mum. \n\n\"Do you remember,\" I muttered, then snatched Julian's cigarette and took a puff, \"when Mum took us all to the beach and Francis almost got washed away by the waves?\"\n\nWe chuckled a bit and fell back into our grim state of mind. \n\n\"I don't remember that.\" blurted Francis.\n\n\"What? How? That got on the news!\"\n\n\"The *local newspaper.* That doesn't count.\"\n\n\"Of course it counts. You were like, eleven, too. There's no excuse as to why you forgot that.\"\n\n\"Maybe it wasn't important.\"\n\n\"Of course it was. It scared us. A lot. Mum wouldn't talk about it for a week.\"\n\n\"Remember Sammy,\" started Julian, \"when Mum didn't talk to you for a day when you joked about Francis getting washed away? I don't even think the joke was that bad.\"\n\nToo soon. If there were any wounds of mine that had healed, they definitely just opened up again. I thought about Mum's helpless body flying through the mid-autumn's air. I wonder if the cars around, watching her when it happened, were horrified by the sight of an alive person about to die an unfulfilling death, or if they laughed at her. She was such a gentle soul, it was simply unfair that she had to die such a tragic and public death. Not peaceful or with family. \n\n\"She had her good moments. Amazing moments, in fact. Remember that month where she'd take us to the armory every weekend?\" I said.\n\nThe armory stopped being in use after the Second World War, and it's now an overgrown field used as a bike track. Mum was so happy there, watching us fly around and playing in the grass like the kids we didn't realise we were. She knew she was on borrowed time, but she sure did reflect on those memories with relish. \n\nWe all fell silent as the fourth vision blinded us. The forest again. I almost felt the cold gusts brush me, but I ignored them when I saw the moving shadows behind the trees. I don't know if I noticed them before. But the sight was almost tranquil. \n\n\"Wanna talk about it?\" I asked them.\n\nJulian took another drag and looked pensively at the wooden planks underneath our feet.\n\nThe air around us fell melancholy and blue, as if a filter were laid over the Earth. I didn't want to be there anymore. I had this huge thing when I was younger, growing up with synesthesia, that when words and atmospheres fell even slightly sad-like, I would be faced with unbearable discomfort. The slightest movements translated into a bitter green, like pondwater, or a velvet red turned into a melodic blue in my mind and it was like the world around me crumbled. But I'm sure everybody had things like that when they were younger.\n\nMum called it 'colour-vision'. She told me that I saw the world differently to everybody else, and that it was completely okay. Other people just had to catch up. \n\nI drove home by myself, in the car I got for my 16th birthday. Francis was meant to get the household Honda Civic, but even if it wasn't wrecked from the crash, I don't think he would have been able to drive it anyways.\n\nOutside the front of my door was an eight-ball. I flipped it over to see if it was one of those eight-balls that you'd shake and it would give you some yes-or-no answer, but it was a heavy, rock-solid, billiard ball. I no longer wanted to go inside the apartment.\n\nI'm writing this story for two reasons;\n\n1. Julian and Francis were reported missing from their homes at 8 AM this morning. It is now 5 PM and I have done nothing but sit at my home and write this to pass the time. \n2. I want answers. I don't know if they're missing because of the Butterknife, but at this point I've grieved for them many times over within my life. I don't just want answers to my situation, but why people can be so cruel. And if there are any ways I can get my mother back. I want her back. Even if it means going into that forest myself.\n\nBut in the corners of every room, I see those shadows from the forest. And in every kitchen cabinet, I see the billiard balls I stole from Mum. \n\nAnd I can't help but feel like my life, or atleast any joy I've ever felt in my 'miraculous' life, is coming to an end. \n\nBut I have nothing to do now but pray. Pray for my brothers and my mother.\n\nPray that my mother rests easy, oblivious to her posthumous fame.\n\nPray that my brothers didn't go into that forest from the visions.\n\nAnd pray that the family curse doesn't take me too.",

        "text": "I bet youâre laughing right now. You probably think Iâm just some idiot with a terrible sense of direction. To be honest, youâre right about the latter, but I assure you, what I experienced is no laughing matter.\n\nThe day I got lost, I was working. Theoretically.\n\nMy colleague Frank and I were sent to represent our food company at one of the countryâs biggest trade fairs.\n\nItâs not a great job. Our boss couldnât be bothered to pay for any of the extra baggage that came with it. No compensation for traveling, no extra payment for setting up the stall, nothing.\n\nEven worse, our work hours would be long, as so often. Weâd have to man the stall from early morning until late in the evening, pretending to be as happy to be there as the fairs many visitors. All the while, our boss insisted we wore those stupid caps with our companyâs name on it.\n\nYet Frank and I had a little arrangement going to make the best of our shitty situation. Heâd been in the trade business for most of his life, and he knew trade fairs inside-out. He knew when things would go slow, especially in the early morning or the late evening. Frank also knew that one person was enough to man the stall during those times. This allowed the other to roam the place, to relax or even take a nap.\n\nThe fair we attended that day was huge. It was held in a giant, sprawling complex comprising various halls, out areas, restaurants and much more, all connected by a variety of hallways. It was the equivalent of a small town.\n\nAfter weâd finished getting the stall ready for business, Frank offered to take care of the morning shift. I was quick to agree.\n\nIâd been wanting to have a look around ever since I arrived. It wasnât a luxury we could usually afford since we were trapped in our stall for the fairâs entire duration.\n\nWhat can I say? I like food, especially meat. When Iâd seen there was an entire hall centering on exotic meat products, I had to go.\n\nI wished Frank the best of luck with the morning shift, stuff the damned cap in my pocket and set out on my merry way.\n\nBeing the idiot I am, I just started walking and promptly got lost. The place really was huge, and even worse, everything looked the same.\n\nAfter finding and tinkering with one of the interactive map displays, I figured out where I was and where I had to go: hall 19.\n\nIt wasnât long, however, before I got lost again. In frustration, I consulted another map display, and learned Iâd somehow taken a wrong turn, and was now in hall 12. Great, thatâs in an entirely different wing of the complex.\n\nThis time, I snapped a picture of the map and followed it to the letter. Whenever I entered a new hall, I checked the big sign telling me which one it was before I cross-checked my position on the map.\n\nI left hall 12, walked past hall 11, and eventually through hall 9. All that was left was to cross hall 14, and Iâd be at my goal.\n\nAfter crossing hall 14, however, and following another hallway, I suddenly found myself in front of hall 24.\n\nI was dumbfounded and pulled out my phone again. For almost a minute, I went over the map, but as much as I searched, I didnât find a hall 24. The highest hall number I could find was hall 22.\n\nStill confused, but not sure what to do, I entered hall 24. After a few minutes of stumbling around, I found another map display. The small red dot told me I was indeed in hall 24. I frowned. How the hell was there even a hall 24?\n\nWhen I compared the map in front of me to the one on my phone, I noticed something right away. The map in front of me was different. It was bigger and several halls seemed to have been added.\n\nFor a moment, a strange feeling washed over me and my eyes darted around looking for...I donât know what. Everything around me was as normal as it could be. Visitors were checking out stalls, talking to sales representatives or indulging in the various samples.\n\nSoon enough, however, something made me look up. So far, Iâd hurried over the fair, not giving any of the stalls a better look. Now that I did, and really looked at them, I saw how strange some of the advertised products were.\n\nRight in front of me, a stall was presenting a fruit called Fallarius. By that point, Iâd been working in the food industry for a good few years, and I considered myself having a rather solid grasp on it. Yet in all those years, Iâd never heard of a Fallarius. When I googled it, I came up with a big fat zero.\n\nWith my interest piqued, I approached the stall. Who knows, it might be one of those weird new mix-breeds that had grown in popularity.\n\nWhat I saw, however, looked unlike anything Iâd seen before. It was a slimy, bright orange thing, covered in some sort of spiky fur. The moment Iâd made it to the counter, I couldnât help but reach out for it. When my fingers made contact, however, the thing twitched and produced a disgusting wet squeak.\n\nCursing, I cringed back, landing me a few annoyed glances and not a few giggles.\n\nFor a few more moments, I stood there, staring at the stall and the weird orange fruit. Then, I shrugged, and went on my way.\n\nPhone in hand, and staring at my map, I tried to find my way back.\n\nAfter following what I assumed to be the same hallway Iâd entered from, I shouldâve been back in hall 14.\n\nYet the entire layout was different. A swift look at the hall sign told me Iâd somehow ended up in hall 27. How the hell had I even gotten here? Iâd followed the same damned hallway!\n\nThere should be an exit to my right, leading to an outer area, but it was gone. Instead, I saw another hallway, one that supposedly led to hall 31.\n\nI frowned. How was the place that big? There shouldnât even be a hall 31. Hell, there shouldnât be a hall 27, and I should be in freaking hall 14! At least, if I were to trust the map on my phone.\n\nFor the next few minutes, I stumbled on, trying my best to ignore the strange, unknown products all around me. Here and there, I stopped, desperately searching for a map display, but saw none.\n\nSuddenly, someone called out to me.\n\nâCan I help you, sir?â\n\nWhen I turned around, I saw an info desk worker. The woman had stopped a few meters away from me and mustâve noticed my predicament.\n\nâYeah, sorry. I guess I got lost,â I admitted, giving her an embarrassed laugh.\n\nThe woman, too, laughed, or rather giggled. It was a strangely throaty giggle. Only now that I focused on her did I see that most of her face was hidden behind strands of thick, dark hair.\n\nâIâve been trying to find hall 19, but the maps are...â\n\nMy voice trailed off. The longer I stared at the woman, the more I felt something was wrong with her. She just stood there, and I watched as she pulled out some sort of electronic contraption.\n\nâProblem with maps,â she started, in a now much quieter voice. âOld versions.â\n\nWhat the hell was she going on about? This was one of the biggest, most prestigious fairs in the entire country. Whyâd they display older versions of the maps and howâd they just add a dozen new buildings to the complex? No, something didnât add up.\n\nâWhere you want to go, sir?â she mumbled in her half-whispering voice.\n\nShe still hadnât moved, still hadnât bothered to brush her hair aside. As I listened to her, I wondered once more what the hell was wrong with her. Even her way of talking was strange. Her English was over-accentuated, but at the same time, it seemed to take her an effort to bring out each individual word.\n\nâHall 19,â I brought out eventually.\n\nâNot far,â she simply said.\n\nThen she turned around and began walking. The way she moved was as unnatural as the way she spoke. Instead of stepping forward, she merely shuffled her feet, dragging herself forward as if something was wrong with her legs. It made her entire body move in a strangely jerky motion.\n\nâComing, sir?â she asked after a few moments, but didnât bother to even turn around.\n\nInstead of moving, I just stared at her. Somehow, I knew I shouldnât follow her. This woman wasnât normal, not normal at all.\n\nâNo. I mean...Iâm sure I can find it on my own. Thank you very much.â\n\nNot even waiting for an answer, I hurried away. I half-ran past stalls and visitors, and only once Iâd made it past a corner did I feel safe enough to relax.\n\nI took a deep breath. Then I looked around, trying to find my bearings. It hadnât been more than a few seconds when I heard the same half-whispered voice again.\n\nâCan I help you, sir?â\n\nIt sounded exactly the same as before. The same over-accentuated English. When I looked over my shoulder, I saw her there, only a few meters behind me, staring at me from behind those thick strands of hair.\n\nI couldnât help but shiver. Why the hell was she following me?\n\nInstead of saying anything, I turned around, hurried towards a hallway, and fled into another market hall.\n\nYet this new hall was even more different. Things just didnât add up. The layout made no sense. Stalls were just placed haphazardly, with no rhyme or reason. When I checked the sign above to find out what hall Iâd ended up in, I almost laughed. Instead of a number, all I saw were strange symbols.\n\nThe stalls, too, were covered in them. The products presented were even stranger than the Fallarius Iâd seen before. They were utterly alien, seemed half alive.\n\nI rushed past stalls and disgusting...things, as an overwhelming feeling of being lost, of not belonging, came over me.\n\nEventually, I stopped. I hid between two stalls, far away from the bustle of visitors, and closed my eyes. Donât give into it. Youâre okay, idiot. Just calm down.\n\nYet when I opened my eyes, I realized it wasnât just the environment that was strange. The people were, too. They were all acting normal, but the way they moved, the way their bodies and limbs worked, was...wrong.\n\nAs I stared after a person, I couldnât help but think that someone had taken them apart and put them back together the wrong way. They were human, yes, but a few details didnât add up. Their arms seemed backwards, their facial features slightly warped, and their torso...\n\nNo, donât focus on it. Just find your way back. Fuck hall 19, and go back to where you came from.\n\nTaking another breath, I approached one of the strange people around me, a woman. I tried my best to ignore her weird body and strange face.\n\nâExcuse me, Iâm trying to get back to hall 7, but Iâm-â\n\nI trailed off when I noticed her wide eyes and confused expression. A fearful noise escaped her mouth before she turned around and hurried away.\n\nAs she did, I saw the way her legs moved. It looked like there were too many joints in them.\n\nFor a moment, I almost lost it because of the surreal situation I found myself in.\n\nThen, I heard a strange, half-whispered, over-accentuated voice from nearby.\n\nSweat broke out all over my body. Itâs a coincidence, I told myself. Yet when I turned around, I saw the same strange woman. This time, however, she wasnât alone. She was talking to a pair of security guards. Both of them looked as strange as she was, and I shivered when I noticed the same jerky movements.\n\nWhen she turned in my direction, I ran. I knew I shouldnât, no, couldnât be found by her again.\n\nYet when I looked over my shoulder, I saw that all three of them were looking after me.\n\nI dashed away, turned right, then left, past haphazardly place stalls, not even sure what exactly I was running from. As I did, I pulled out the damned cap and threw away the jacket I was wearing. It wasnât much, but maybe, just maybe, they wouldnât recognize me.\n\nThe layout of the hall, however, was too disorienting. There wasnât a place to hide, and I knew if I stayed here, it was only a matter before theyâd discover me.\n\nThen I saw a tightly knit group of people making their way toward a hallway. I instantly ran in their direction, trying to mingle, to hide between them. When I reached them, however, I saw how wrong they all were. Some were too short, others too tall. Some were shambling around while others were slumped over. In-between, I saw children running here and there. They were moving on all fours, more like animals than human beings. When one of them focused on me, I saw glaring animalistic eyes.\n\nI pulled the cap deeper in my face before I pushed myself past the strange gathering and entered the hallway ahead.\n\nThis hallway, however, differed from any Iâd seen before. It was small, almost constricting, more a tunnel than anything else. The floor was dirty, and the only light that reached me came from randomly placed yellowish lamps.\n\nAs strange as the place was, however, I could do nothing but hurry on. Driven by an almost primal fear of the woman and her companions, I ran on and eventually entered the hall at its end.\n\nIâd barely crossed a few meters when I noticed just how strange the place was.\n\nThis wasnât an orderly market hall. Neither was it one of the disorienting, haphazardly thrown together ones.\n\nNo, this place didnât feel like it had been planned out or even constructed. It looked more like a shanty town, a place that had grown bigger and bigger over a long period.\n\nThe ground was as dirty as that of the hallway and a variety of stains and fluids covered it. I saw caskets and boxes everywhere, saw empty cages, and, occasionally, chunks of meat, discarded and left to rot. The air was heavy with a disgustingly sweet smell.\n\nIn an instant, I pushed myself past empty crates and behind a stack of boxes.\n\nWhat the hell was this place?\n\nMy eyes darted around, trying to find out where Iâd ended up at. Eventually, I found the sign, but the hallâs number was all wrong. At first I didnât know what it said, but after a few seconds, I could decipher it. It was supposed to be hall 37. The numbers, however, they were backwards and distorted. They looked as if someone whoâd never seen numbers before had written them.\n\nThatâs when it clicked.\n\nIt wasnât just the sign, it was this entire place. This wasnât a fair or a market hall. It was an imitation, one that was all wrong.\n\nThe people, the things populating this place, they too, were nothing but cheap imitations of the human form. They wore mismatched pieces of clothing, ones that were too small or too big, and shoes that didnât fit. Their entire form was warped, as if something horrible was hidden below their outfits.\n\nWhen I focused on one such person, a cold shower went down my spine. My entire body felt cold. A nervous chuckle almost escaped my mouth, and I had to scream at myself not to move until theyâd passed.\n\nWhat Iâd thought was a face wasnât. It was a mask, a drawing of a happy face frozen in a perpetual half-smile. But it was too simple, too cheap and reminded me of a childâs crayon drawing.\n\nThe strange person shuffled past my hiding place and then stopped in front of a stall, or something that was supposed to look like one. It was nothing but a crude construction made from wood and rubble, an amalgamation of trash. Hooks dangled from it here and there, each sprouting a chunk of raw, bloodied meat.\n\nI watched as the thing approached a hook. In a swift motion, it tore down one of the dangling chunks and pushed it below its mask.\n\nFor a few seconds, it seemed to chew on the meat. Then a long, black tongue slithered out from under the mask and I watched as it licked blood and pinkish goo from its misshapen hand.\n\nA while longer, the creature just stood there, staring at the remaining chunks of meat before it shuffled on.\n\nBy now, I saw that a similar creature manned the stall, one wearing another of the crayon-masks. A strange, grunt-like sound escaped its mouth when it saw the empty hook.\n\nI watched in confused horror as it approached something covered by a piece of clothing. It was a cage and for a moment, it moved the cloth aside and seemed to check what was inside. When it did, I heard something: sobbing. The sobbing that was unmistakably that of a human being.\n\nAnother grunt. The cloth went back down, and then the creature vanished behind the stall, tearing aside a curtain I hadnât even known was there. I only saw it for a moment, but I couldâve sworn I saw blood and gore, and something that might once have been a human body.\n\nI barely covered my mouth and drown out the scream that had wanted to escape my mouth.\n\nThen, still huddled between crates and boxes, I realized what those stains, those fluids on the floor all around me, had to be. Blood. Human blood.\n\nThen those chunks of meat...\n\nThis time, I could do nothing and threw up right where I was.\n\nAlmost instantly, heads turned to where I was, heads sprouting the same smiling crayon-faces. In a frantic motion, I stumbled out from between crates and boxes. Before any of the creatures could react, I ran. I rushed past them, past the non-stalls theyâd erected, and then back into the dark, tunnel-like hallway.\n\nIâd almost made it, had almost escaped this hellhole of a place when a hand closed around my arm.\n\nâCan I help you, sir?â\n\nThe same words, the same damned words. The same over-accentuated voice. As if to mock me, the strange woman, the thing in front of me, repeated them once more.\n\nâCan I help you, sir?â\n\nThis time, I realized what was wrong with her voice.\n\nIt wasnât the half-whispering, neither was it the over-accentuated English. No, it was the voice. It sounded as if someone, or something, was trying to emulate English. Another cheap imitation, another one that was all wrong.\n\nâNo, let me go! Let me fucking go!â I screamed at the thing.\n\nI tore at the arm holding me in place, twisted my body, only to be pulled backwards.\n\nAt that moment, the hair that had covered the face was thrown aside. For the first time, I could make out its face.\n\nI instantly cringed back. It wasnât one of the simple crayon-like fakes. No, it looked almost real. Almost. It was a mask, but one made of skin, of lifeless, human skin. And then, something moved, but something that was hidden below. I could see a hidden mouth, could almost see it turn into the outlines of a twisted grin.\n\nI screamed in terror, tried once more to get away, but it was too late. The commotion had been noticed.\n\nFrom the entrance of the not-hall in the back, hulking, shambling figures were making their way towards us. By now, they werenât even trying to keep their imitation alive anymore. No, all that remained of it were the empty, half-smiling crayon-faces.\n\nâCan I help you, sir?â the thing next to me repeated once more.\n\nThis time, the words came out in the same throaty giggle Iâd heard before.\n\nThe image of those cages returned to me, of the hooks and the chunks of meat dangling from them.\n\nThat would be me, I realized. This was what awaited me.\n\nAnd then, my fear, my terror, was pushed aside by rage. No, it wouldnât. I was not livestock. My free hand shot forward, and in a single motion, I tore apart the disgusting, dead skin covering the creatureâs face.\n\nWhat I saw below was nothing but twisted flesh and scar tissue. An inhumane shriek, one of outrage escaped its mouth, and I felt the hand holding onto me let go.\n\nAs the thing covered its face, I dashed away. I was out of the tunnel in an instant and then back into the disorganized hall. I didnât lock back, didnât want to see what was coming after me.\n\nNo, I just ran.\n\nMy legs led me through hall after hall, each stranger than the one before. They were all twisted and wrong. One seemed to be built vertically, with stalls stacked on top of one another continuously. Another was populated by stalls that seemed to have grown and were more alive than the beings moving between them.\n\nMore than once, figures pointed and stared at me. Some cringed away, for I was as alien to them as they to me. Yet sometimes, I felt hands reaching out for me, trying to hold me in place.\n\nIn sheer and utter panic, functioning purely by adrenalin, I ran on. My lungs were burning, my legs were getting weak. I had no goal, no direction. I just ran on, trying desperately to flee the surreal place my world had become.\n\nThen I collided with someone stepping out in front of me. I stumbled, lost my balance, and crashed to the floor. I cursed, fought myself back up, and was about to rush on when a hand closed around my arm.\n\nIn my mind, I could already hear the same words, the same question.\n\nInstead, I found myself face to face with a man who looked entirely human, a security guard. Yet I didnât stop. I tried to get away and eventually pulled my arm free. This was nothing but another ploy, another fake who was out to get me. I stumbled another step, then another, before I fell once more.\n\nMy eyes darted around, searching for hulking, shambling figures, but all I saw was faces, normal faces. Some seemed worried, others confused. A group of teenagers nearby snickered behind their hands. I even saw a couple dragging their son away the moment I stared at them.\n\nYet they were all unmistakably human.\n\nBy now, the security guard had motioned for his colleagues to come over.\n\nAs they stood in front of me, their mouths moved, yet my brain didnât seem to function.\n\nOnce more, one of them got a hold of me, pulling me to my feet. In an instant, however, I tore myself free again.\n\nâThe hellâs the matter with him?â one of them brought out.\n\nAnother mentioned the words âdrunkâ and âdrugs.â\n\nI finally opened my mouth and began rambling about being followed, and hunted down before I closed it again.\n\nâYou saw what? Someoneâs following you?â\n\nâNo,â I started shaking my head. âI mean, yes, thereâs this woman and those men, but...â\n\nMy voice trailed off when I saw their expression and how they stared me down. It was clear they didnât buy a word of what I was saying.\n\nâI think itâs best for you to leave the premise, sir,â the one holding onto my arm eventually said, or rather, commanded.\n\nWith that, they swiftly escorted me from the complex.\n\nStill confused, but more than relieved to finally having escaped the place, I made my way to our hotel.\n\nWhen Frank arrived, he was pissed.\n\nWhile I was sitting on the bed, he laid into me. He ranted on about where Iâd been, what I thought I was doing, and even told me heâd informed the boss about me skipping out on the job.\n\nI only half-listened, still plagued by what Iâd seen just hours ago.\n\nEventually, Frank got a hold of my collar and pulled me up close.\n\nâThe fuckâs the matter with you, Danny?â\n\nAt first, I only stared at his angry face, but then I opened my mouth.\n\nâI donât know. I think I got...lost? No, never mind.â\n\nWhen Frank heard this, he let go of me and the anger on his face evaporated.\n\nâWhat happened? What did you see?â\n\nInstead of answering, I shock my head and told him he wouldnât believe me, anyway. For a moment, Frank continued staring at me, before he grumbled something, but left it at that.\n\nLater that evening, though, when the two of us went out to have some beers, I finally opened up to him.\n\nFrank listened without saying a word. Once I was done, though, I couldnât help but laugh again. I told him I must be overworked, or that Iâd had a panic attack.\n\nFrank, however, didnât join in my laughter. Instead, his face grew dark.\n\nâNo, you did get lost.â\n\nâWhat are you-?â\n\nâListen, Danny, these days, they make these places, these fairs, too damn big. Thereâs too many people. Itâs only natural that some get lost or end up in...places they donât belong. Happens all the time, just no one ever talks about it.â\n\nâHow do you...?â\n\nFrank didnât answer. Instead, he just sat there, staring at his beer, avoiding my probing eyes.\n\nâBest thing you can do is not to wander around and just stay at your stall,â he finally whispered.\n\nWhen he looked up again, I saw his expression, saw the sad, anxious look that now filled it.\n\nFor the next couple of minutes, I pressed him to tell me what he meant. I asked him if heâd gotten lost himself, but Frank never said another word about it.\n\n\\---\n\nItâs been years since it all happened. Iâm not working with Frank anymore, and I neither do I work at trade fairs.\n\nI just...couldnât do it. Whenever I went near those giant, disorienting halls, and saw the countless people entering them, I was pushed into a state of almost-panic.\n\nIn time, however, as the years went by, what happened that day became nothing but distant memories.\n\nJust recently, though, having finally gotten over my fears, I visited one of our local trade fairs with a friend of mine.\n\nAs we walked from hall to hall, I couldnât help but look around and watch my surroundings.\n\nI saw them.\n\nI saw the few select people who seemed bewildered and confused, who seemed lost. Itâs always people who are a tad bit different, a tad bit wrong. People who just donât seem to belong.\n\nAnd I can always see those who are preying on them. Figures who pretend to be info desk workers, security guards and even sales representatives. And I can see them lead them away, lead them into directions that shouldnât lead anywhere, or that lead [somewhere else entirely.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": "My grandma gave me a weird list of rules PART 2\n\nMy grandma saying those words made me remember everything vividly from that night. It was not a nightmare, everything was real. \"Grandma, what happened?!\" I ask her while freaking out.\n\nShe looks at me with a sad face and says \"It's too late.. they already have your soul.\"\n\n\"What?\" I ask again confused and desperate at the same time, but right before she could answer, everything goes black, it was like I fell into a void.I couldn't hear or see nothing for a time that felt like eternity. As I was waiting, still hoping I am just having a bad and long nightmare, I start hearing some screams. High Pitched screams like someone was having their organs removed while awake.\n\nI recover my vision, and I look around. It seems like I am in an empty valley. I start walking, hoping to find someone that can help me or at least answer my questions.\n\nI gasp as I see buildings, it looks like I am near a settlement. I start running until a dark silhouete stops me. He was around 3 meters tall, I look at him in fear. He nods and grabs my hand, drags me towards this weird building. It had red walls and was incredibly large, like something I have never seen before. While he was dragging me inside the building, I see other people. With other.. creatures. They looked lifeless, but alive at the same time. It was truly frightening, knowing that nobody will ever save me. We entered a room, where there were other dark silhouetes and creatures, that looked very mad at me.\n\nThe thing dragging suddenly stops, in front of all of them.\n\n\"You broke many important rules, even though your grandma warned you about the possible consequences.\"\n\nI now realize I am in hell,remembering my grandmother's list of rules, and that I would face unimaginable things soon, so I get on my knees, and start begging for mercy. While sobbing and shaking in fear, one of them gets in front of me, and tells me \"We are giving you this one last chance\".\n\nI look up, he punches me in the face so hard I pass out.I wake up back inside my grandma's house, in my room. I get up, and see the paper with the rules next to me. I read them again they are the same ones,however there were 2 extra rules.\n\nEXTRA RULES. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION :)\n\n8. If any of the creatures you've seen in hell enter your room, stop breathing, don't make any noise, or they will take you back. However, if you're lucky, nobody will bother you.\n\n8a. If they catch you, you need to react fast. Remember that knife that is in your pocket? Stab the creature in its chest and they will leave you alone. If you don't react fast enough, then there is nothing that can save you.\n\n9. Pay attention to every single rule. This is the last chance you get, if you won't abide to the rules we will torture you for eternity, until your soul is sucked out of you.\n\nGood luck!\n\nI look at my watch, It is 2 AM. I get in bed and try falling asleep.Suddenly, I hear someone enter my room. I close my eyes and try making no noise. I hold my breath till I almost pass out, and then I finally hear the creature walking away. Shortly after, I hear 5 knocks on my door, just like the night before I got sent to hell. I open the door, it's grandma. She sits on the bed next to me, and hugs me. \"Thank god you survived.\" I try asking her about the traumatising events that happened. She refuses to answer. At exactly 8 AM we go towards the kitchen togheter and quietly eat breakfast.\n\nAfter that, I get out of the house, I didn't even say goodbye to grandma. I just ran. I called my mom shortly after, told her about everything that happened. I could hear her crying and then she said \"Now you know why we never visited Grandma.\"\n\nAfter I get home, my parents tell me that my uncle had the same thing happen to him. I've always thought he died in a car crash, like they used to tell me when I was younger.\n\nEven to this day, I am still traumatised by what happened, and I am trying to live a normal life.\n......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nOr so I tried.",

        "text": "I came here because I honestly suspected the cat that I found outside tonight was a skinwalker and this is my second experience. Im almost completely positive and from my knowledge I know theyâre evil. There was a rotten smell and something just seemed really off about the entire situation. I live in a semi-rural town in the US (originally from Ukraine but we moved to TX when I was younger) tonight was cold so I went outside to call my cat inside. He always comes when I call. Always. But tonight he didnât. Instead I heard meows. Very very very strange meows, it was coming from my barn and even when I have NOT thought of skin walkers FOR YEARS NOW, some reason while I was walking towards the barn my initial thought and intuition led me to believe it wasnât a cat. But I thought I was just being ridiculous and walked towards the noise anyways, deep. Into my barn. What I found was a slightly older orange kitten. He was hesitant and didnât let me touch a lot, but since it was cold I wanted him to at least eat and maybe come inside. I picked him up and led him towards the food bowl (still outside) and he was acting very strange and I didnât know what but something was really off. The cat itself looked normal. It was also really strange, he wouldnât eat. Usually stray cats/ kittens would GOBBLE up food but he didnât, he just smelled it and kept walking  around me. Then I began hearing a noise like scratching and a banging metal noise (it was DEAD silent otherwise, and 0 wind) I moved towards the noise and it stopped. The cat continued to follow me and it was just behaving really strangely. I began feeling extreme paranoia and my gut feeling told me something was really off. Then I noticed the smell right after I investigated the noise. It smelled horrid like rotting flesh or a dead animal, I smelled my sweater to see if it came from the cat (since I picked it up) and that wasnât it. Then my hands since I petted the cat, that wasnât it either. It seemed to come from where the noise came from. Then the cat acted extremely strange. He walked off into the distance and thereâs this small stone square filled with water from the well for animals to drink from (like chickens and our dogs), the âcatâ walked INTO THE COLD WATER with 3 of its legs and the 4th was up. (He did this before as well when I was petting him, randomly lifting one of his paws, I thought it was because the ground was cold and his paws were hurting from the cold but I no longer believe that) and then began to meow HORRIBLY, it was so deep, the type of meow that a cat does when in pain or anguish. This was right after the noise and the smell. This lasted for 2-3 seconds and then he bolted back to me and went behind me (the smell immediately went away). Then began rubbing himself up on me and acting as a regular cat would act. At this point my mother was calling me in through the window and I went back inside. The cat followed me but stopped before we reached the porch, either this is a really odd cat or it didnât come near my house since the house is Blessed. \n\nNow let me quickly inform about my first experience with something like this. I still donât know if it was a SW or maybe I was too tired and imagined something but I donât believe so. It was when I was in the 8th grade (2015?) or around that time. I came back home from the movies with two of my friends, it was late around 10 pm. My grandmother lived RIGHT next to me and between us far off is a forest. A small little trail is between our houses (open field not forest) itâs length is about 1 kilometer. I decided to go visit her since we had a really close relationship and wanted to tell her about the movie (she was in her 50âs during this time). I sprinted to her house (since the wide open field that was so close to a scary dark forest always frightened me) and we spoke for about 5 - 10 minutes which she then told me it was late and that we both needed to go to sleep. When she could, sheâd always walk me back to my house at least half way. So thatâs exactly what she did, she walked me up until the barn (same barn where I found this âcatâ) and waited until I got inside my house. Once I came inside (about 5-10 min after I came in) I realized that my cat was still outside and so I opened the door to call for her, and saw a whitish gray figure standing at the barn. I initially thought it was my grandmother. Being Ukrainian, the word âbabaâ is what we call our grandmothers. So I yelled out âbabaâ a few times and the figure didnât budge. I realized it wasnât my grandmother. I quickly slammed the door shut, locked it, ran to my room, locked my window and closed my blinds. I was shaking, my eyes were watering and I was terrified. I had no idea what I just saw, I convinced myself I saw something that wasnât there and I was too exhausted to comprehend. But that was only a coping mechanism, I definitely saw that. \n\nNow, back to tonight. Once I came back inside, closed my blinds, and lied in bed. Outside of my window I heard those really odd meowing noises, I have never heard meowing like this before and decided to ignore it and take to Reddit. Itâs stoped now, it only lasted for about 10 seconds. I donât really have much knowledge about Native American beliefs like these so would appreciate any and all information and advice. Tomorrow I decided to buy some sage and burn it in and around my house. I donât know if what I experienced with the cat was just a really unique and strange cat and Iâm just looking too much into it? Or maybe I have a right to be anxious about the situation. If itâs truly supernatural, then my theory is that there was 2 of them. One being the cat and another where the smell came from along with scratching and the noises. Maybe the cat protected me from the second one? Doesnât seem likely to me from what I know about these creatures but idk. The cat didnât have the smell, and maybe that strange meow was it trying to communicate with the other one? And it suddenly coming behind me (going in between me and the noise) was it protecting me too? Iâm not sure I know I sound like a crazy person but I honestly just donât know what to take from this. The cat had also bit my thumb once when I pet it but thatâs a typical cat behavior ð¤·ð¼ââï¸ so maybe Iâm looking too deeply into these things? Help :( I honestly hope it was just a really weird cat, I would feel much more at ease.",

However, my friend Jacob sent me a message through BeReal. \n\n\tOptimusnonPrime13 reacted to your BeReal: (Shocked Realmoji)\n\n\tOptimusnonPrime13 commented on your BeReal: Wow Isaac! Just wondering, who is that in the background? In the window? Or am I just seeing things?\n\n\tJacob was right, someone's face was pressed up against the window. I immediately looked up to where the window was, but nobody was there. The quality of the BeReal couldnât quite highlight the details of the mysterious face in the window, but you could tell that the face was pale, and something was not right about it. \n\n\tI looked more outside the window, and there were footprints within the snow leading from into, and out of the yard. Someone had been stalking me, so the obvious choice was to call the police. \n\n\tI was freaked out, and slightly terrified. When the police arrived, they found nothing, no traces of anyone anywhere, and the footprints only lead to the road, where there was no snow.\nAll they could do was file a report for a trespasser, and after that, they left. The ring cameras didnât catch anyone, as my window was near a blindspot. That night, I locked myself in my house and tried to get some sleep, but I barely got any. \n\n\tThe next morning, my story about my stalker was overshadowed due to the fact a girl in my grade shot herself. Her name was Samantha, and news of her death quickly spread. Samantha was bullied frequently because of her weight, and I guess she didnât want to deal with that. However, I wouldnât know for sure because Iâd never be caught dead with Samantha.\n\n\tWe even made an instagram account just to make fun of her. I realized that the fan account wouldnât get anymore videos of her anymore, which was quite saddening. However, I was wrong. My friend Jacob snuck inside of Samanthaâs funeral, and took his BeReal there. An absolute chad. He even titled the BeReal: âSamanthaâs funeral was really breathtakingâ. Everyone reacted to it with laughing Realmojis, including me.\n\n\tQuick Note: Samanthaâs body was found in the river, after she had killed herself with a shotgun. Although the body couldnât be recognized, the autopsy suggests that they were matching DNA results. Her family seems to have an abnormal grieving pattern, especially in her brother. People have reported Samanthaâs brother making violent remarks about harming other people, especially after his sisterâs death.\n\n\tJacobâs next BeReal seemed normal at first. Jacob had been left to live in the house as his parents were on a business trip. For any peculiar reason, Jacobâs younger sister, Pam, was hiding underneath the bed. Her long, black strands of hair lead from underneath the bed. Something felt wrong about Jacob. It came to my realization that Jacob didnât have a sister anymore. Pam passed away from Leukemia last year. \n\nSomebody else was in his house. Tell Jacob to leave immediately. Call the police. \n\n\tThe police were too late. The police found his body. Jacobâs BeReal was his last photo. Jacob was found with his entire head smashed into a pulp. Crimson color caked the surfaces of his carpet and walls. They simply stated that he was murdered, but not quite how. I only found out because in school, Jacob's girlfriend discovered someone had taken her phone, and took the picture of Jacobâs body. It gets even more strange. Jacobâs phone couldnât be found. \n\n\tJacobâs death came after poor, fat Samantha. Since Jacob was literally ambushed and murdered by something, school was put into a safety lockdown for a week. Part of me couldnât believe that Jacob had truly died.

Part of me knew that the stalker had involvement with Jacob, and even fat Samantha. \n\n\tI made sure all the doors, and windows were locked. Something terrifying was out there.

I immediately shot up, and looked to where the picture shouldâve been taken. It was taken from the door. Even in the complete darkness the manâs silhouette could be seen. I wanted to think that this was in my imagination. Unfortunately, it wasnât.

        "text": "Before my cardiac arrest, I was a bad person â a really bad person. I stole, cheated, and hurt many people. There are dozens of innocents I traumatized for a lifetime. My near-death experience changed me for the better, but it didnât change the past.\n\nI canât recall much from when I died. Itâs like looking at a fish just below the surface, you canât clearly make it out but you can see the outline, and if you look just right, youâll see it all â even if just for a moment. There was fire and brimstone, and an entity cloaked in shadows whispering words I couldnât understand. Those visions have never left me.\n\nAt the end of my first week in the hospital I lay in a cold bed pondering my life. As I fell into a disturbed slumber, a loud scratch echoed across the room. A frightened gasp escaped my lips. Just outside the window, a dark figure loomed. It was pawing at the glass with dirty fingers.\n\nI slunk halfway underneath my covers. Whirring machines monitoring my vitals beeped quietly.\n\n*Tap. Tap. Tap*\n\nIts slimy hands slapped the windowpane. They slid down, leaving greasy stains. I could feel its hatred radiating through the reflection. Then it cupped its hands together and peered into the room.\n\nI looked on in horror. *My* face stared back at me. There was one glaring difference, its eyes were deep pits of black â my blue irises swallows by the darkness. A crooked smile crossed its face and it disappeared into the night.\n\nI didnât sleep a wink that night. At one point I started screaming uncontrollably. Nurses rushed in and sedated with me a large needle. I saw it again in my dreams, but it was no longer smiling.\n\nFor three months I remained in the hospital. The rehab was as excruciating and it was monotonous, but eventually, I was back on my feet. Throughout my time at the hospital, there were no other sightings of my ghastly doppelgÃ¤nger. I convinced myself it was all a hallucination.\n\nOn the first night home, I bought a nice bottle of wine and celebrated with a few glasses. I hadnât touched a drop of alcohol since the accident, so it took almost nothing to get me drunk. Parked in front of the TV, I let the warm glow of inebriation wash over me.\n\nâYou left me all alone down thereâ¦â a garbled voice awake me from a drunken slumber.\n\nThe other me stood in the doorway of my living room. It glared with devious intent.\n\nâYou deserve to suffer with me. This pain is too much to bear. I will drag you into the darkness like the dog you are â *we* are.â\n\nIt took a ragged step toward me. Ash billowed in its wake. I jumped from the couch and yelled, âYouâre not real,â until my throat became hoarse.\n\nâOh, but *we* are real. If I think, therefore I am. Iâm in agony, therefore I am.â It responded flatly.\n\nI fled into my bedroom and slammed the door shut. After propping a chair against the doorknob, I crumpled into the corner sobbing.\n\nâYou canât hide from yourself. Not for long.â Footsteps receded down the hall. I was left alone with my cries.\n\nFor weeks, I remained locked in my room, only leaving to grab food deliveries from my doorstep. At night wicked laughter would float through the house, but the other me stayed hidden. By the end of the month, even the laughter disappeared. Once again, I started to believe it was all in my head; the near-death experience having altered my brain chemistry.\n\nSunshine streamed through my blinds and I felt happy again. The fear dissipated like smoke on a windy day. I ventured into the world and felt a semblance of normalcy return. How short-lived that was.\n\nIâd called up an old friend, a reformed criminal now involved in youth mentorship. We met at a trendy restaurant just after 7 pm and sat in a corner booth. After exchanging pleasantries, he said something that my blood run cold.\n\nâBy the way, this is the craziest thing. Thereâs a guy sitting on the other side of the restaurant who looks exactly like you. If I hadnât known better I would have thought it was your twin.â\n\nâWhatâ¦.who? Point him out for me?â My voice trembled.\n\nâThe guy wearing the sunglasses. Right there.â I followed his finger.\n\nThe man waved menacingly as my line of sight met his. A lump grew in my throat. I immediately excused myself and practically ran from the table. My look-alike followed.\n\nI bolted into traffic in an attempt to lose him but to no avail. He was hot on my tail and a foul stench filled the air. Careening into an alley, I ran into a dead end. A barbed wire fence blocked my path forward.\n\nâI wonât go back without you. We will share this eternal torment.â\n\nâI wonât go. Thereâs no fucking way. If youâre really me, why do you want to see me suffer so badly?â\n\nâYou are already sufferingâ¦.â\n\nI backed into the fence. My hellish twin advanced. As I looked for a way out, my door brushed against a long, metal pipe â left over from a long-abandoned construction project. In a single fluid motion, I bent down, picked up the blunt instrument, and cracked it into his skull. His head exploded in a shower of blood and smoke and he crumpled to the ground.\n\nFlames engulfed him. Smoke twirled in the air, twisting into a rapidly oscillating tornado. My mouth was forced open as the smoke was driven into my gullet.\n\nI fell to my knees. Unbearable pain paralyzed me. Every atom in my body felt like it was being pulled apart at the seams. I began to black out, but the agony never dimmed.\n\nI awoke in a hospital, strapped to the bed. The pain had gotten worse. I wasnât dead, but I wasnât living either. Eventually, they moved me to a long-term rehab facility, unable to diagnose a specific issue â but Iâd knew Iâd never leave.\n\nTyping out my story took months. Each keystroke was like a bullet to my fingers. I'd only last a few minutes before passing out from the excruciating pain.\n\n[I didnât go to hell, but I brought hell to me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightProfessor/)",

        "text": "I sat across from Franny admiring my manicure and letting my bones warm. Franny looked hot tonight. Maybe too hot. We were going to be eating delicious Naruto Ramen in just another few minutes. Franny looked across the table at me and reached across to take my hand. \n\nâYour hands look super pretty, Jess. Thanks for bringing me for my absolutely favorite food! You know I love me some Naruto!â\n\nâYouâre looking drop dead gorgeous yourself and youâre so welcome.â I felt my face force a smile. It was the least I could do for Franny tonight.\n\nFranny smiled right back at me then took a look around the jam-packed ramen shop. It was a bitter cold, rainy, Sunday night in January. But Naruto was the best ramen spot in Park Slope. Somewhere, someone must have just opened a window. A blast of icy cold air hustled against the ambiance of the soup steam; logarithmic spirals of steam rising then suddenly freaking out; disturbed by the extreme temperature differential. The steam formed shambolic shapes that quickly dispersed into nothingness.\n\nFranny took a healthy sip of her third J-Pop and said, âIâm getting a little tipsy. I better go find the bathroom.â I nodded as Franny levitated, doing a mostly okay job before making her way towards the bathrooms. It looked like there was a long frustrated line that had beat her to it. \n\nAlone at our tiny table I first noticed the man and woman at the table to my left. They seemed to be nearing the end of their meal and having an absolutely unlovely time.\n\nThe woman said, âThereâs something thatâs really bothering me. Are we still having a, âcasual and low keyââ¦,â The womanâs hand made a vague Italian gesture that came a little too close to my face. I skooched my seat back a few inches and tried to observe covertly.\n\nThe man looked to be in his early fifties. He had a freshly shaved head and no facial hair. He had clear blue eyes and a rather angular jawline. \n\nâIt just got so fucking cold all of a sudden,â he said grinning. âOh, but wait, I have an indoor hat!â\n\nThe man reached across the table and grabbed a wool hat from on top of a fedora that the woman had handed him a few minutes earlier. \n\nHe put the hat over his head then smiled, âThatâs better.â\n\nThe woman was Asian and had pretty long black hair. She was busy knitting something that appeared to be the beginnings of a scarf at the table, a giant ramen bowl empty before her.\n\nâDid you hear what I said?â she asked sharply. âI donât really like talking about this stuff.â\n\nThe man said, âYes, itâs still casual and low key. But it sounds like you want to fuck other guys.â\n\nThe woman sat up a little straighter and stopped knitting for a moment. Her brow furrowed.\n\nâI donât think I can be monogamous.â She resumed knitting. The man said nothing. For all the background chatter in the shop I could have heard a cockroach stroke out. \n\nThe man said, âItâs fucking cold,â and took off the powder blue wool skull cap and put on a fedora that looked like the one Indiana Jones wore.\n\nThe man was drinking Asahi beer. He took a pull. \n\nâSounds to me like you want to fuck other dudes.â\n\nThe woman appeared to be a good ten years younger than the man. Her knitting continued unabated and she said, âThis is New York. Youâre supposed to tell the other person if you get feelings!â\n\nThe man took another sip of his beer. He looked none too pleased. Somewhere I heard a plate drop and break.\n\nâIâm pretty sure I made it clear I liked you from the first date,â he said.\n\nShe started to say nothing then changed her mind.\n\nâWe could still see each other. It doesnât have to change anythingâ¦â she said plaintively before looking up at him for a moment. The knitting resumed. \n\nI put my hand over my face trying to appear disinterested and tried to appear interested in my soup. Franny returned from the bathroom along with the waitress from the kitchen with our ramen and another round of drinks.\n\nThe man adjusted his fedora slightly. It cast a wobbly shadow across the planes of his angular face.\n\nâGod I must have low blood sugar, Franny,â I said. âI just need to be quiet and eat for a bit.â\n\nFranny smiled and shrugged. âSure baby,â she said and picked up her chopsticks.\n\nThe man took another pull of his beer then put it down holding it in both hands. He rotated the bottle clockwise then counter-clockwise before nodding his head and saying, âNo.â\n\nâNo, we canât see each other, or No, it doesnât change anything?â, she asked.\n\nThe man watched her knit for a moment then said, âNo, I donât want to see you again.â\n\nâEven if I still want to see you?â\n\nâIf youâre thinking of other dicks then you ainât thinking of mine. That means you shouldnât be fucking me. If youâre fucking other guys and thinking of me then I donât know what to say.â\n\nThe woman was quiet. Finally, she said, âI respect that.â\n\nThey were both quiet and I slurped some noodles pretending to look at a balding ginger man with a very big nose. I suddenly realized the pit in my stomach that was on fire since last Thursday was tame. I shifted in my seat and my hand brushed the pocket of my blazer. I could feel the vial sliding around with my cigarettes and keys. \n\nâWhy wouldnât you want to have me and other women if you could?â the knitting woman asked.\n\nThe man took a pull of beer and appeared to think a moment before saying, âWhy go out for hamburger when you have steak at home?â\n\nThe woman appeared to think a moment then nodded reluctantly.\n\nâYou know you should have said something if you were getting feelings,â she said again.\n\nâI donât think thereâs anything to be upset about. You can go fuck whoever you want now without stressing.â\n\nShe knitted some more. Franny made slurping noises. âMmmmmmm. Sssooooo goooood,â she slurped.\n\nThe woman seemed to be looking for the waitress. The man seemed to notice and said, âItâs been a long day. Iâll get dinner and you can just get your coat on and Iâll give you a hug goodbye.â\n\nThe woman stared at him quizzically.\n\nâNo. Iâll pay for dinner.â She looked around hard for the waitress but she was not there.\n\nâItâs okay. Iâll pay. Donât worry about it.â\n\nâWhy do you want to pay for dinner?â she asked.\n\nThe man finished his beer and put it next to the other empty bottle.\n\nâI suppose it has to do with propriety.â\n\nâWhat do you mean?â she asked hard.\n\nThe man let out a slow sigh heavier than a broken heart.\n\nâIt means doing whatâs appropriate I suppose.â\n\nThe woman stopped knitting and appeared to be trying to decide something. She nodded and stood up. She handed the man a recyclable shopping bag with pictures of vegetables and fruits all over it. The man looked inside and pulled out a neatly folded black wife beater and a black tee. He put it back in the bag then put the bag down.\n\nThe woman finished buttoning her coat and pulled on a sky blue ski cap that had embroidered across the front in gold, âBrooklyn vs. Everybodyâ.\n\nThe man stood up. The woman skooched out between the tables brushing against my arm. I felt someone step on my grave. My head rocked back and my neck cracked. Franny picked up her bowl and made a loud slurping sound.\n\nThe man put out his arms and the knitting woman stepped into them. They hugged. \n\nâFor what itâs worth I still think youâre the ratâs ass,â she said.\n\nThe man looked at her and said, âEverybody says that.â\n\nThe man unwrapped her and stepped back. She turned hard and fast and made her way through the steam and the tables and out into the night. The man sat back down.\n\nThe waitress appeared and he asked for the check. She nodded and disappeared.\n\nThe man took a deep breath and removed a pair of aviators from his face. He rubbed his eye with the cuff of his shirt then said, âJesus fucking Christâ¦â softly to himself.\n\nI looked at the man. He noticed and his face softened into a smile.\n\nâHowâd you like the food?â I asked. Franny looked at me funny.\n\nâIt was great. How about you?â he asked.\n\nâReally good,â I said and smiled.\n\nThe waitress returned and the man tapped for dinner. The waitress thanked him and disappeared again.\n\nThe man put on his raincoat and buttoned it up to his neck then turned up the collar. He adjusted the fedora and said, âHave a good night,â to me.\n\nâYou too,â I said.\n\nHe smiled appreciatively and I felt the last embers of the fire in my stomach die. \n\nAnd then he was gone.\n\nWhen Franny and I got home that night I went straight to the bathroom and stood over the toilet bowl and said, âIâm so sorry Jesus. What the fuck was I thinking?â\n\nI poured the vialâs contents into the toilet then flushed it. I rinsed the vial out with hot water in the sink and then put it on the soap dish to dry. I realized I had been bawling like a baby.\n\nI whispered, âYou ainât worth the fucking salt in my tears,â through my tears. \n\nDoes anyone know a good divorce lawyer?",

I discovered the origin of everything.â\n\n**Chapter 1: Transfer Initiation Protocol**\n\nI saw fit that I should write my testimony after the events that unfolded, at least, such chronologically regimented events were, to me, an unhappening process when I first saw the clock that had struck at the last second of all existence.\n\nIn 2010, I was hired by a fusion research institute in Boston, Massachusetts after I graduated from Oxford University with a double major in theoretical nuclear physics and engineering. On my first day on the job, I clocked in that morning on time quite perfectly. â8:00.01,â I thought, âjust one second off par.â After nearly a decade of research at WardenClyffe Scientificâs FuseTech division, our research committee achieved the first efficient magnetically confined fusion reaction capable of boiling water hot enough to spin a 1200 Megawatt turbine, equating the MW per hour of a normal fission reactorâs turbine. This breakthrough was only the beginning of the clean energy frontier, earning the inventor the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Nuclear Instrumentation. In 2018, our next project included doubling the size of the steel torus chassis, installing eight magnetic rings each twice the diameter of the length of an 18-wheeler trailer, and sixteen thermo conductive heavy water pipes through the center of the donut, each running to two 1400 Megawatt turbines and four cooling tanks. With over a year of assembling tens of millions of custom-manufactured parts, this 30 billion dollar project became the worldâs largest fusion reactor, about 25% larger than ITERâs Tokamak.\n\nOur goal was to produce heat. Lots of it. Exceeding the highest temperature ever produced by a factor of five: 1.1 billion degrees Fahrenheit. In three years, new developments allowed the reactor to push its temperature higher than previously thought possible, apt to turn ten turbines at 16% greater efficiency than the average American fission plant, producing one hundred times the power required to run it. The greatest flaw was maintenance. Due to the extreme temperatures, deformed aluminum tiles had to be changed every day, which was soon replaced with glass silicon fiber shingles. One day, an operator forgot to calibrate the magnetic strength of the giant coiled rings before the ignition, which usually does nothing but spark helium-3 gas. The reaction instead successfully bloomed into two bright violet bands. Once the operator quickly turned the knob, the violet bands of ionized Helium-3 collapsed into each other into one band, releasing a surge of power directly from the machine. Upon discovering residual electricity at much lower temperatures, the use of the steam turbine was rendered economically obsolete. At just under 1 million degrees Fahrenheit, we designed the magnets to direct a string of ion bands moving clockwise at the roof of the chamber, then ignited a string of bands at the floor moving counterclockwise, milliseconds before smashing both bands together tightly around the center of the chamberâs donut hole. Each burst of energy burned at billions of degrees, generating vast amounts of power, earning our committee a Nobel Prize in Renewable Clean Energy and a multinational award.\n\nEverything was great. We saved trillions of dollars in petroleum mining and coal-burning plants in the U.S. And then we discovered something bizarre that we would later regret having ever invented the reactor. Because the polarized plasma bands collided within 100-microsecond intervals, like two rivers fighting against each otherâs currents, the Helium-3 protons created billions of microscopic black holes, firing out and hitting the chamber walls, each lasting as long as 10\\^-30 seconds compared to the Large Hadron Colliderâs 10\\^-83 second black hole lifespan. Little did we know our institute hopped on a playground of dynamite when our new clean energy vision got dumped by endeavors to study black holes. Why cut off our decade-long project in the process of revolutionizing modern civilization? Nobody is certain, except perhaps to expediently excite third-party financial investors a third time with some grandiose idea that black holes will solve the energy crisis. Lo and behold, we did just that.\n\nBy combining black holes, electrons and radiation was released into the flow of Helium atoms and their fused protons. Then those holes grew to sizes large enough to consume those protons until the current emitted a stream of electrons straight into the chamber walls. While the power generated was significantly lower than expected, the power required to perpetuate the black hole stream for one hour would equate to a single AA battery, breaking our previous record for the worldâs most efficient clean energy producer. The temperature at ignition begins at 1 million degrees, then cools down to only 500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe reason this great discovery became tragic news to us was that the fate of the world would forever be in the hands of the control deck, and we would be liable should the facility or the city of Boston, or the entire earth be sucked into a black hole. But even that would have been a better alternative to what I alone had discovered. You see, mass publicity of the most successful institute in the world breaking its world records leads to scientific arrogance in a frantic race to make history, reminiscent of the atomic bomb, the ICBM, and the Arms Race of the Cold War. Rather than a race driven by intercontinental pressure, ours was entirely a business show, like kids dissecting and showing off the coolest parts of a pressure-gauged warhead. FuseTech had unfortunately fallen victim to this ancient, intellectual arrogance.\n\nOne of the most terrifying projects I was involved in, titled, âEvent Horizons,â endeavored to open and manipulate a black hole for one second before evaporation. Members of our committee included Simon Beavers and Christopher Hopkins, two field inspectors slightly younger than me, and Dr. Gertrude, an older lady in her mid-sixties who worked as both a secretary for Dr. Manry and an operations manager. I began the first phase of ignition. All the orbiting black holes combined into just two, each the size of a grain of sand, lasting 676.6 milliseconds before both evaporated simultaneously. Then I began the second trial, forming exactly two holes orbiting opposite to each other for 950.9 milliseconds. Then the third test, 999.3 milisecs. The fourth, 999.9 milisecs. Then the fifth, barely at 999.8 milliseconds, ready to shut off.\n\nâKeep going,â Dr. Fisher Manry, the chief executive of the FuseTech divisionâs experiment, insisted, âweâre only at 200 megawatts. Shoot for 225.â\n\nThe machine boomed with a deafening hum, occasionally crackling and popping like a rocket. Bright sparks of white fire in the two opposing streams of violet-ionized gas flashed sharply on the camera monitor. I computed the collapse sequence and pulled the trigger. 1000.0 milliseconds; the one second. That instant, the chamber flashed with a loud POP of gunfire before the black holes evaporated.\n\nâShut it down!â commanded Dr. Manry.\n\nI quickly brought the reactor to a halt, turning the chamber lights on. The CCTV monitor depicted what appeared to be a thin, perfectly circular, black ring around the chamber midsection.\n\nâThe camera sensor must have been fried,â I suggested, âbeta particles can knock out light receptors and punch holes in the image.â\n\nDr. Manry said, half-listening,\n\nâInteresting. Open the bay windows.â\n\nThe thick steel doors over the control centerâs circular windows were hydraulically pried off. There it was. Floating in mid-air, wrapped around the torus center, was a black line no thinner than a hair.\n\nDr. Manry, looking nervous, turned to me, âOkay Isaac, this is where you come in. The field inspectors will meet you in the clean room to suit up. Recover a sample of the anomaly. Gertrude will be on the line.â\n\nGertrude overheard from the machine diagnostic computer and said, âYup. And radiation levels are safe. Temperatures are cool enough now for entry,â then she asked Dr. Manry, concerned, âmaybe we should wait and call authorities.â\n\nâI will if the situation calls for it. The anomaly should just be compacted diamond or dense carbon, or at worst, an unknown, highly radioactive element,â he said.\n\nAs a physicist, I was no fool to not find that theory strange, as none of the elements ionized could fuse into carbon-based configurations unless Dr. Manry had already simulated the particle statistics.\n\nWearing lime green trash sacks for HAZMAT suits, Simon and I climbed up a four-foot ladder under the chassis, opened the bottom hatch, threw the sample kit up through the door, and climbed in.\n\nâSurreal,â I thought, as the echoey charred tile walls welcomed me with an unnatural sound reverberation you would only hear in skydome theaters elsewhere. The line was ten feet above our heads, with a radius of sixteen feet. I pulled out a Geiger counter from the supply case.\n\nâNo reading,â I tuned in.\n\nâStrange. Iâll measure again,â Dr. Gertrude said through our headsets, âtry setting your ladder up to get a better ping.â\n\nâIâll be careful not to touch it,â I promised.\n\nI climbed up the ten-foot ladder, meeting the phenomenon at eye level. Oddly enough, no radiation was detected.\n\nI tuned in, âHey Gertie (short for Gertrude), what is the gauss on the magnets?â\n\nâTheyâre zero.â\n\nâAlright. Hey Simon, can you hand me the EMF detector?â I spoke as he handed it to me, âI want to see if our magnets electrostatically crushed our particles into carbon, seeing as it is completely black.â\n\nâWhy do you think it's carbon?â Simon asked me.\n\nI thought, as though mentally doing chemistry math,\n\nâDr. Manry did, actually, but the only carbon fused here would be in the silicon shingles. I bet thatâs the problem.â I continued as I climbed the ladder, âBesides, since switching from aluminum panels, weâve always had problems, andâ¦ uhâ¦ well that canât be right.â\n\nGertie tuned in, âWhat is it, Isaac?â asking me condescendingly.\n\nâThere is absolutely no electric field around the hairline. It just looks like a razorâs edgeâ¦ totally motionless. I wonât touch it, but you could cut your finger right along it.â\n\nShe remained silent for a moment before I continued,\n\nâOkay, we are attempting to take a sample of the specimen with our handy-dandy wire cutters.â\n\nI climbed down the ladder, got the tool, and climbed up once more, with Simon holding up a test tube for me to drop a thread of wire in.\n\nSimon warned me, âCareful. Slowly cut with your eyes closed in case it flashes again,â\n\nI hovered the cutters around the hairline, shut my eyes, closed the blades, and suddenly, the ring loudly popped like a firecracker, flashing a torching white light like a magnesium oxidation reaction. I pulled back the tool, my hands stuck motionless. No. I feel my arm moving. Where did it go? Am I frozen? Paralyzed? Simon screamed when he caught sight of me, so startled he fell off the ladder.\n\nâReport Isaac. Whatâs going on?â Gertrude demanded me.\n\nBefore Simon could get the words out, I realized I was not a statue.\n\nSimon exclaimed,\n\nâIsaac! Your face. Your arm. Itâs stretching out. Crap. Donât move!â\n\nI stepped down a rung of the ladder, looking up in shock as though my right arm had fallen off. I was looking up at myself, completely motionless, holding the tools at the exact moment the cutters touched the line. I lifted my hands to see them in utter disbelief. My whole body made millions of copies of itself wherever I moved, leaving a grotesque trail of my stretched anatomy suspended motionless on the ladder. I heard fierce arguing in the control deck.\n\nGertrude commanded me in a trembling voice,\n\nâIsaac, whatever you do, do not move. Do not get off the ladder. Do not touch Simon or anyone. We are sending a team to escort you out of there safely. Simon, leave all the supplies, leave the door open, and exit now.â\n\nA long pause weighed on my traumatic situation as I saw through a thick cloud of my bright lime green suit and body parts clinging to the ladder. I saw my nose stretch when I tilted my head back, then I reinserted the nose going forward. I consoled myself with funny thoughts to distract my shaky trance, like, âIâve worked here for ten years and still canât get my head outta my butt,â as my head was currently inside the butt of my suit. Paramedics in lime green HAZMAT suits arrived outside the chamber with a stretcher.\n\nâIsaac,â Dr. Manry tuned in, âslowly climb down the ladder, go around all the supplies. Do not step over them.â\n\nI did, seeing my body stretching a long trail behind me. He continued, âDescend the ladder carefully.â\n\nWhen I climbed out of the chamber, officers, paramedics, and security personnel stood around me at a distance.\n\nâHold it. There. Thatâs good. Stay where you are,â an officer commanded.\n\nThe officer then proceeded with questions while Simon scanned me for radiation,\n\nâYou are considered too dangerous to be questioned anywhere other than where you are standing. Is that okay?â\n\nâI, uhâ¦â\n\nâAre you okay?â\n\nâI think so. I feel like Iâm in shock,â I said.\n\nâHowâs your pulse? Any heart palpitations, fibrillation, trouble breathingâ¦â\n\nâFine. Really. No different, except my body is everywhere. Iâm scared now. My knees are knocking,â I blurted out without qualms of being terrified at the sight of my hundreds of very stationary legs.\n\nI saw a horrifying lime-green worm of body parts spilling out of the reactor hatch. I wanted to say something funny to console their terrified expression just so they would know I was still human, but I knew this was more serious than I was able to fathom, so overwhelming in fact, my mind broke, drowning in diverting thoughts into an intoxicating, enigmatic hysteria like a traumatized soldier laughing at his decapitated comrade.\n\nThree men dressed for business rode with technicians on a roofless utility fleet cart through one of the side garages of the assembly building toward the crowd forming around me. I saw people begin recording me. Any attempt to cover this up has already failed at this point. Maybe they wonât need to. The technicians set up infrared cameras around me and a bomb rover with a built-in X-ray camera. Within thirty minutes, every worker on and off duty stood at a distance to record on their phones the horrifying frozen snake of arms and legs drooping out of the reactor chassis like an amalgamation of wet laundry hanging out of a washing machine. Every breath I took was ice cold, or at least, I felt my warm breath turn cold enough to sink to the floor.\n\nâIsaac, do you feel close to hypothermia?â one of the technicians of the infrared camera asked me as others gathered around to see its screen.\n\nâNot at all. Kinda hot in this suit, actually. Iâm light-headed and my legs are tired. I think I need to sit down for a minute.â\n\nA moment after I sat on the cold concrete floor, I heard a bomb rover squealing its motorized chain wheels, steering itself towards me. I overheard the techniciansâ conversation.\n\nâHe doesnât seem to have a clear heat signature. His remaining body is extremely cold. See. Thereâs Issacâ¦ on the floorâ¦we need X-rays.â One of them called out to me,\n\nâIsaac, hold still real quick. Weâre taking your X-rayâ¦ in threeâ¦twoâ¦oneâ¦â The rover snapped photos, retracted its camera arm, deployed a laser thermometer, and aimed it along my elongated mass.\n\nâHow?â the bewildered operator said, âHeâs deadly cold. Below freezing. Itâs reading -271.1C.â Dr. Manry stood behind the operator and technicians, staring dumbfounded at the screen, postulated,\n\nâHis atoms appear frozen in time. Thermal radiation canât emit from them. No radiation except visible light seems to reflect off of his suit.â\n\nThe rover touched one of my contorted gloves that protruded from the ladder.\n\nâSolid,â the technician said, âlike a solid wall. His hands are firmly stuck to the ladder. I don't know how weâre going to get it off.â\n\nThe rover poked at the sleeve, expecting the plastic suit to wrinkle, but it was frozen, as though I had bathed in liquid nitrogen. He then began a second phase of experimentation,\n\nâIsaac, weâre taking a sample of your suit now. To be safe, we will cut some rubber off your boot and the tips of your laces. Extend your leg and donât reach out to assist the robot.â\n\nThe rover cut rubber from the sole of my left boot, then it cut and pulled the shoelace out, leaving trails where they lightly swung from the toy claw, and dropped each into separate test tubes. He said,\n\nâCrap. I didnât think this through. The tube is stuck.â\n\nDr. Manry corrected,\n\nâTurn it on its side, in his direction, and pull it out.â\n\nThe rover drove away, carrying the glass bottle with the opening facing toward my boot, drawing a dark rubber line in mid-air. Then the bottle shattered when the shoe laceâs trail filled its volume. After a quarter-hour of recovering the samples uncontained on ceramic dishes, Dr. Manry made a call after some dispute of how I would be moved without leaving streaks of my every atom in the facility.\n\nâFeds are on their way,â I heard him murmur.\n\nI sat for three hours, buried in not-so-solid parts of my body. It was dark in here. Outside voices became muffled. I heard an affirmative call,\n\nâHow are we doing in there, Isaac?â\n\nI felt crippled like I had lost eyesight, coping with thoughts of an unforeseen lifestyle I now have to endure.\n\nâIâm worried I wonât ever leave this place again. I think Iâm going to die. The more I move, the more âmeâ there is.â\n\nI could tell no one was listening. I was, in their eyes, just a circus anomaly. I lay on my back, dizzy from existential stress. Gertie was right. We shouldâve waited to call the authorities.\n\nI heard a helicopter beating wind on the roof of the enormous assembly building, landing somewhere near the parking lot. I heard news crews gather at the site. I slowly crawled out of the amalgamation to see hundreds of photographers outside the building fenced behind police tape. Flashing red and blue lights flooded my vision as black vans swarmed the grass lot, and multiple military helicopters landed close to the building as I overheard the distinct chatter of, âPresident.â The Massachusetts state governor with the state attorney general arrived shortly after.\n\nAn hour later as the sun was setting, there he was. U.S. President Conner Reinking flew from the White House, arriving in Boston in the Marine One helicopter, landing on one of the empty lots. I never felt such surreal notoriety before upon seeing the man of America duck under the police tape, saluted by the marine corps as the green alien beast befell his eyes. Then I heard a distinctly familiar female voice calling my name.\n\nâIsaac!â she called for me.\n\nI stood up, completely obscured by my bodies, and inched myself forward to see her. I thought I must be dreaming. My wife stood in front of a crowd of over a hundred scientists, police officers, military personnel, paramedics, doctors with radiation equipment and satellite dishes, and men in black.\n\nâAmelia?â I called out, but the crowd was too loud to hear me.\n\nThe President greeted Amelia, standing next to her to speak first before handing a megaphone to her. The crowd silenced, and the teams stopped what they were doing. He then turned the volume up just enough to hear him address me, stepped up on a soapbox, and said,\n\nâMr. Coffman, this is the President speaking. Can you hear me?â\n\nâYes Mr. President,â I said enthusiastically.\n\nâI came to inform you that five research institutes from around the world are working tirelessly, determined that they will not stop until they have completely restored you back to your family. Mr. Coffman, I give you a word of hope for you and your family and encouragement in this arduous situation. America bends a knee of prayer that you return home safely.â\n\nI responded,\n\nâThank God. Please get me out of here! My face is in my crotch, I think. I will be okay for a while.â\n\nThe President chuckled, affirming me,\n\nâNow, Mrs. Amelia, your beloved wife, has some words for you,â\n\nShe stepped up, megaphone in hand, and said anxiously,\n\nâIsaac. Isaac, wherever you are, Iâm here for you. Iâm scared. Be strong for me, okay?â\n\nI inched forward, revealing my form outside the floating lime-green mass, hearing her lightly gasp.\n\nâIâm here, honey,â I said faintly.\n\nI unzipped the suitâs head and took off my mask, showing my rapidly smearing face.\n\nâIâm coming home. Donât worry. Iâll be strong. Theyâre gonna get me out of here,â I bravely ascertained through the frozen statue of my face.\n\nâHoo-rah,â all the rescue teams cheered, along with members of various divisions and first responders chanting, âUSA! USA!â\n\nI then asked Amelia, âWhere are the boys?â\n\nâIn the lounge. I can bring them here.â\n\nâPlease do,â I said as my voice broke into a cry at the thought that I was standing inside my grave, ready to be buried alive.\n\nThey came, and I wanted to hug them. A single handshake would fuse their hands to a freezing claw. The boys spoke to me like I lived to hear my eulogy. My oldest son said,\n\nâEveryone is in the lounge.â\n\nâReally? Okay. Can you tell grandpa Iâm alright? Also, there is a soda machine down the hall on the right. Can you roll me a can?â\n\nHe chuckled, âIâll tell grandpa to get you a pickle, âcause you sure look like one.â\n\nâHa!â\n\nâAny flavor?â He asked.\n\nâYeah. Except for Fanta. I donât like sour juices. Grandpa might have some cash.â\n\nI then asked Amelia, âHey honey, what time is it?â\n\nâItâs almost eight oâclock,â She said before the President got word of tonightâs plan.\n\nShe gave him the megaphone and he announced,\n\nâMr. Coffman, I got good news and bad news. Iâll tell you the bad first. You are going to have to sleep where you are tonight while the international society of nuclear science pulls an all-nighter to assess possible solutions. The good news is, a report will be written and ready to begin trials tomorrow.â\n\nAt around 11 pm, the news and press crews began to leave, then the men in black with the President and the marines thirty minutes later. All members of the science community left by midnight.\n\nI could not be any more grateful to Gertrude and the rest of my team, because hours after their shift ended, they stayed here to support me until all was assessed for the night. I was given a mattress, sheets, and a toilet sheltered by a curtain rack. I laid my head down, unable to pull the blankets over me. I wondered where my family slept. They probably went home. Nonetheless, I was alone in the dark, seeing only a green light flash occasionally on the ceiling and hearing the motors of ventilation units starting and stopping.\n\nThen came the silence.\n\n**Chapter 2: Atomic Epiphany** (1,804 words)\n\n**Chapter 3: Freedom in the Half-life** (2,452 words)\n\n...\n\n**FOR THE READER:** *The remaining content of Chapters 2 and 3 can be found in the google drive link and the link to the published document.

        "text": " \n\nThe Gorge\n\nMy Family (My dad, my Mom, and my 2 sisters) and I entered a theme park. There are tents and booths on either side of the walkway. On the left, there's a specific tent that's larger than the others, probably 15 feet tall and 20 feet wide with a curtain entrance with red and white stripes vertical on the tent like a circus tent. The man in front of the tent who's dressed like a ringmaster leads us in and it looks to be a house of mirrors and then shifts into a funhouse with many doors. In the back of the tent, there's a door that he attempts to lead us through. \n\nEver since I had this dream the first time I always tried to warn my parents about what's behind the door and that if we go in Iâll die. I tried to beg my parents not to follow the man but they always do. The room that appears behind the door is seemingly endless in all directions, just a blinding white room with a thick layer of fog all around. There are no walls on either side, only the door, a long platform that leads into the nothingness and no floor below the platform, just an abyss. A room of complete nothingness.\n\nThe man starts walking straight onto the platform and leads us about 20 feet away from the door. I always end up behind everyone. The second I lose sight of the ringmaster on this platform he disappears, and that's exactly what happened. My mom moved in front of me and I couldn't see him anymore. Now he's not in front of us anymore, we look back and he's standing at the door. He turned around and walked through the door closing it behind him.\n\nThe platform is now multiple mushrooms, the same large and flat type of mushrooms that are in Mushroom Gorge in Mario Kart Wii. I turn again to face the end of the platform, my parents aren't there anymore and the platform ends on the mushroom I'm standing on. I turn again to face the door, Iâm alone and the door is gone. The only thing that exists in this room is me, the mushroom I'm standing on and the endlessness below. \n\nI soon find out through crying out for help to no avail that there is only one way out of the room, and that is through sacrifice. No matter how many times I have had this dream the only way out is through jumping off the mushroom and infinitely falling. \n\nEach time this dream appears I know the end result and every time I know that when I jump off the mushroom I will fall further and for longer before I eventually wake up. This brings the fear of not knowing when I wake up and not knowing if I will wake up before I hit the ground if there is one. \n\nEvery time I jump off the mushroom, even though at this point I know itâs a dream I canât shake the fear of falling or the screams I make when I jump. \n\nIâm terrified each time I have this dream. I wake up hyperventilating and cold and sweaty. I feel as though Iâd died in my sleep and I have to wait hours for my motor skills to behave how they should. Each time I have this dream it takes longer for my arms to stop shaking, my breathing to steady, and for my body to even sit up in bed.\n\nEvery time I have this dream I enter the dream at the same age I was when I first had it. Iâm 20 now and I've had this recurring dream since I was 5, so now the fall seems to take forever before I finally wake up. \n\nThe Gorge scares me, but finding the ground scares me more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I should type my dreams out more often",

        "text": "Greetings. \n\nThe following is a copy paste from an AskReddit post I commented in. Shortly thereafter, I learned of this subreddit and wanted to also share. \n\nThe question: Do you believe in the paranormal (ghosts, demons, ect.) why or why not? \n\nYes. Because I learned how to do a crossroads offering at a younger age. Being a nihilist and a bit of a sociopath, I was curious and wanted to face something. It was stated that a figure in black or a black animal would come.\n\nSo I waited on a full moon, at 3 am in a rural road where itâs not traveled often, and did it. Buried the container with my offerings for the ritual. I donât aptly remember everything but I knew there were bones in that mix, from an animal. However I did bury it and waited. \n\nAnd 3:30 rolled around. \n\nAll of a sudden, I see someone walking in a long gown of sorts. Pitch black. Itâs a woman. And sheâs walking to the intersection. Has a relaxed but steady cadence to her walk. I couldnât make out many facial expressions but she seemed rather attractive at a glance, but there was some kind of veil over her face. She walked past me and I thought nothing of it until she stopped. \n\nI legit got scared when I looked back and her eyes seemed to reflect off the moon under the veil. \n\nThen she walked again in the same direction as intended. \n\nItâs said that youâre supposed to follow the entity to fulfill the contract and make a deal. Seeing how I wanted to know this creature and the reality of this dealing, I set out to make this occur. \n\nI checked my watch. 3:34. I looked back over and she was gone. Mind you, there was a clearing all around this intersection. You can see if people are coming from any direction. \n\nI couldnât believe it. I couldnât have imagined it. I looked around but there was nothing. No people, animals walking about, no cars. Just me and the moon. \n\nI left in my truck and went home in a different direction, as the figure walked toward the direction I would normally take to go home. Took me a few extra minutes but I didnât wanna chance it, actually. \n\nI rested my head in a weird fear. But was able to sleep. The dream shifted my ideals forever\n\nI dreamed I was in this suspended animation. Floating yet falling at the same time. In front of me, I was float falling towards this swirling vortex of nothing. The fear I had was now insanely intense. For it felt like this darkness was staring back at me. And I called out to know if it had a name. When it did, shortly after it said \n\nâNOOO!â\n\nI was frozen in bed, panting violently and sweaty. I cried. I pissed the bed. My body sore, especially my chest. Like something had clawed at me. \n\nI went to the bathroom to clean up and toss my boxers. In the shower, I finally noticed. Five distinct claw marks in the center of my torso. I looked at my hands and saw no skin or any sign of clawing myself. Then I tried contorting my hands to see if I could have. I couldnât without moving my elbow way up past a limit in my rotator cuff. But still. \n\nAfter I cleaned up. I took to google and look up the name I was informed in my dream. \n\nI was speechless. \n\nHis name was Zozo. According to what I looked up, he was the Keeper of Hells Gates. And he rejected me it seemed. There are times when that feeling looms upon me when i focus on people or groups of people. No matter what, it never has escaped me. And after, I was convinced of the existence that there is a hell. And I saw the entrance to its domain.",

        "text": "Hello all, quick introduction. Long story short, Iâm a fighter pilot and proud to say it. I went to pilot training in north Texas where I got the privilege of training with all of our wonderful NATO partners. We flew the T-6 Texan II for the first half of the (approximately) year-long course and then the T-38 Talon for the second half. The T-6 was an overpowered crop duster and the T-38 was a supersonic wannabe fighter jet that had the turn radius of a Ford Ranger carrying a 60 foot boat (it was massive). She loved to go fast and hated being slow, and sheâd kill you real fast if you werenât careful. Anyways, pilot training is a stressful time where you just cram as much knowledge into your nugget as you can and hope you perform to the level of excellence that they (the instructors) expect. It is extremely challenging and rewarding at the same time because at the end of it, you get to call yourself a pilot and at our specific program where we train to be fighter pilots, most of us go on to fly the F-22 Raptor, F-35 Lightning (Fat Amy), or F-16 Viper. Sometimes dudes get the B-52, B-1, or B-2 but not as often as the former.\n\nDuring my time in the T-38, I experienced something that would make me question quite a bit about our known world. It was about the same time that the DoD released the UFO reports from the Navy and announced they will be conducting more investigations to figure out what is actually going on. In my young and arrogant mind I thought âhey maybe one day when I have my own fast jet with a super fancy targeting pod and state-of-the-art radar maybe Iâll see a UFO.â But I was just a lieutenant in a T-38 with none of that stuff; just my Mk II eyeballs to make sure I donât hit another airplane or the ground. I was deep into the formation phase of training where we train to fly really close to another airplane through all phases of flight to make sure we can do it without trading paint. It was a standard October day in Texas and I was scheduled to fly with one of my good classmates in the other jet whom I enjoyed flying with because he and I were both pretty damn good at flying in formation. We briefed up the sortie as a standard 2-ship formation ride just before our checkride which meant we were pretty much running the show from engine startup to shutdown. One part of the brief that we talk about is weather and NOTAMS (you know that thing that caused the nationwide ground stop a few weeks ago? Those things). One NOTAM that stood out was talking about some GPS interference out in the MOA we would be working in but not to worry, it was clear and a million out there; not a cloud in sight and our operations were based off radial/DME from the VORTAC which was working just fine so no GPS? We didnât care too much. \n\nMe and my buddy did our usual preflight routines of taking a piss, making sure we hyped each other up for the sortie then getting our takeoff data, tail numbers, and final words from the supervisor before putting on our gear. Walking out to the jets we did our normal cool-guy walk, helmet bag over the shoulder with shades on and our finest headbands sporting our training class patch. We passed our hand signals and got the jets running, taxied out to the runway and took off in the tightest fingertip formation you could ever ask for from a student; we were on something different today. Issues started when we eventually FENCE-IN to the MOA. My GPS was acting funky but we expected this so I just ignored it; I heard my wingmanâs voice come over the radio shortly after I noticed.\n\nâHammer 1 from 2?â\n\nâGo ahead 2â\n\nâGPS is degraded, yours too?â\n\nâ1 copies, yeah mineâs degraded tooâ\n\nI hear my IP chime in from the backseat to humbly remind me that Iâm still a student âclear concise comm on the radio, cut out the extra BSâ to which I respond with a swift âcopy.â\n\nAfter getting our G-exercise done we did a turning rejoin and while Iâm focusing on flying the proper parameters I get a call from the area controller.\n\nâHammer 1, Fort Worth Centerâ\n\nâCenter, Hammer 1?â I reply clearly and concisely as my IP said.\n\nâHammer 1 Iâve got VFR traffic transiting your area at your right 2 oâclock and 6 miles altitude indicates 11,500 and no oneâs talking to himâ\n\nThis is right in my way as our airspace is from 8,000 up to 22,000 and is one of those things we run a knock-it-off drill which means âletâs stop training for now until they leave so itâs safe for us to maneuver again.â After all, transiting traffic is a relatively normal occurrence in this part of Texas.\n\nâHammer knock it off, Hammer 1 knock it offâ I say swiftly on our interflight radio\n\nâHammer 2 knock it off, copy traffic callâ my wingman says.\n\nâHammer 2, go fighting wingâ which tells my wingman to stay close to me and maneuver freely on my wing as we inspect this intruder.\n\nâCenter, Hammer 1 is looking for the traffic; can we get a direction and altitude?â\n\nâHammer 1, Fort Worth Center, he appears stationary at your 11 oâclock and 4 miles altitude still indicates eleven-fiveâ\n\nâHammer 1 copies, weâre looking.â\n\nAt this point I know within 3 miles I should be able to see something especially when Iâm at 10,500 looking slightly up into blue sky. I slow my scan pattern and I ask my IP in the back âyou see anything?â to which he replies ânah, I donât even see him on the iPad.â Squinting my eyes now I keep my lookout while also monitoring my own altitude and speed, looking back at my wingman who I can see he is looking in the same direction desperately trying to find this guy.\n\nâHammer 1, Fort Worth Center, traffic now 11 oâclock 2 miles stationary.â\n\nâShit heâs closeâ I say to myself but Iâm cut off as my #2 comes over the aux radio\n\nâHammer 2 tally 1 left 11 oâclock high, looks like a weather balloonâ\n\nI refocus my eyes and he pops into my field of view.\n\nâHammer 1âs visualâ I say mildly confused.\n\nWe pass by this extremely polished silver bean-shaped object at 350 knots, so I bank it up and pull to maintain tally of this guy as I see #2 follow in suit just behind me.\n\nâFort Worth Center, Hammer 1 is visual with the traffic. It looks like a weather balloon? heâsâ¦ not moving though.â\n\nâWhat do you mean heâs not moving?â\n\nI wanted to say something sarcastic but you canât really do that on the radio so I more politely replied âLooks like a weather balloonâ\n\nâUhhh, center copies?â\n\nMy mind is completely boggled at this point. Weather balloons donât look this symmetric and Iâm pretty sure they arenât bean-shaped and they usually have instruments or something hanging off of it; this had none of that. âwhat the hell?â I say to myself and my IP replies âthis is a first.â He gets on the radio next to talk to the other IP in the other jet.\n\nâ2 bravo from 1?â\n\nâGoâ\n\nâYou seeing this too?â\n\nâYeah Iâm not sure what to think of itâ\n\nâShould we call someone?â\n\nâDude who do you even call for this?â\n\nâNo ideaâ\n\nâHammer 1. Fort Worth Center, can you contact us on 3XX.XX?â The controller rudely cuts us off.\n\nThat channel is just a less cluttered frequency, I think heâs isolating us at this point so they can talk to just us. And not the other hundred airplanes transiting through the Texas airspace.\n\nâHammer push 3XX.XXâ I say to direct my wingman to switch to the new frequency.\n\nâHammer check?â\n\nâ2â I hear in a more concerned tone now.\n\nâCenter, Hammer 1?â\n\nâHammer 1â¦ this is uhh, Fort Worth Center got you loud and clearâ now this is a new voice, an older-sounding voice than the young female one I heard earlier.\n\nâHammer 1, can you give me the details of that contact?â\n\nI reply swiftly âCenter, it looks like a big silver bean-shaped weather balloon, maybe 20 foot diameter and 40 foot longâ\n\nâCenter copies, Hammer 1 advise you stay clear of that contact outside of a mileâ\n\nâHammer 1 copiesâ\n\nI ease off the bank and Gâs to widen the circle Iâm carving around this âballoonâ and glance down at my gas. âHammer ops check, 1 is 2.3â I say. â2 is 2.2â my buddy replies. Great, we have enough gas to continue for a bit longer. As I move my eyes back to the object I see what looks like a green light coming out of the middle.\n\nâHey you see that light?â I say to my IP. He says âyeah, is it glowing?â he cautiously replies at which point he jumps on the radio.\n\nâCenter, Hammer 1 it looks like thereâs a green light coming off of itâ\n\nThe older voice comes back in a serious tone âHammer 1, center copies, weâre looking into itâ\n\nâHammer 1 we have no confirmation of weather balloons released in that area, advise you separate.â\n\nâOkay Hammer 1 copiesâ and as I roll out of the bank I notice that green light turn to a deep red and begin to pulse on and off. Just as I notice the subtle light change I see a beam of red cross in front of my jet which expands in size vertically like a wall that was erected out of thin air. âSHIT!â I say as I try to pull out of the way but the beam cuts off my trajectory and I fly right through this red film. I look back behind me at what I just flew through, and I see the perfect silhouette of the T-38 in the film in addition to my wingman rolling inverted and jinking down to avoid the same beam but it was to no use. The beam tracked my wingman and he flew straight through it to the same result. 2 perfect T-38 silhouettes imprinted on this red beam that retracts itself into the object like a lightsaber being turned off after we passed through. \n\nWe watched in confusion as the bean rotated along its longitudinal axis and shot straight up into the darkness. âWhatâ¦ theâ¦ f\\*\\*\\* just happenedâ my IP said in the backseat.  \n   \n \n\nâHammer 1, Fort Worth Center, weâve lost that contact, are you still visual?â\n\nâNegative Center, It flew straight up and itâs goneâ\n\nâSay again Hammer 1?â\n\nâItâs gone.â As I unkeyed the mic my IP came on the radio âWeâll get vectors back to Homeplate, VFR now.â\n\nâHammer 1, center copies IFR cancellation received, turn right 080 vectors Homeplateâ\n\nThe whole ride back was a mix of utter confusion and mild terror. Center swapped us to the approach controller who we talked to pretty much all the way back home and then to the tower controller who told us that weâd be met by someone at parking. As we were rolling up to our parking spots and shutting down we were met by the wing flight safety truck and a couple of men not from our unit with a hardened laptop. They brought us aside on the flightline away from all the other jets and crew chiefs and asked us a few questions about what we saw, what we did, and if there were any other details that would help their investigation. As we responded, one of the guys would type away on the laptop. We gave them our copies of the flash drives which stored the HUD tapes and audio recordings from the jet and the guy with plugged them into his laptop. He finished uploading the material onto the computer and we watched the highlights on the tape, listened to the recordings and when he was satisfied said âalright we got what we need.â They asked us to keep quiet about the whole ordeal until they finish up their investigation and we asked when weâll hear back they said âyouâll know Iâm sure.â We finally passed on our contact information and they said âif we need anything else from you weâll find youâ which made all of us a bit uneasy but hey, weâre in the military. Iâm sure we wonât be that hard to find.\n\nWe got back to the debrief and my IP took the 3 of us aside and said âyou heard those guys; they seemed serious. Letâs not talk about it. Consider this the debrief.â My friend and I looked at each other, shrugged, and walked into the flight room talking the same game we normally do with our classmates. Every now and again when we run into each other weâll have a few beverages of the alcoholic variety and bring up the memory but itâs becoming more rare nowadays. All I know is that whatever we saw that day now knows what a T-38 is; luckily, we have more lethal stuff than that piece of junk so hopefully weâll be ready.",

        "text": "\"Hey, Noah, can you draw us?\" My friend, Joey, practically begged me on his hands and knees, pulling his girlfriend close to him. Cindy nodded in agreement with her boyfriend's request.\n\nI raised an eyebrow, chuckling to myself. \"You do realize you'll have to stand still for a while? I can only really draw still-life stuff.\"\n\nThey both shrugged it off, already sitting in a position they could hold for a while. I grabbed my sketchbook and got to drawing. It didn't take long to sketch out their forms, followed by the details that would make each of them uniqueâthe freckles across Cindy's mouth, the muscles along Joey's arms, the way her hair sort of swirled like a tornado. As I leant back to take a peak at the finished product, I realized I had accidentally drawn Joey's hand on Cindy's shoulder... Or at least I thought it was Joey's.\n\nThey were not even remotely similar. Unlike Joey's broad and large hands, the fingers on Cindy's shoulder were wrinkled, devoid of any moisture. Long, rotting nails jutted out like bones from the tips of its fingers, digging into Cindy's hot pink blouse. I looked over at her,, but there was no hand to be there. Just as I went to erase the decrepit limb, Joey took the book out of my hand.\n\nCindy looked delighted, clasping her hands together. However, as her eyes trace the drawing, she must have hovered over the rotting hand because her face fell. She pointed at it, causing Joey's expression to drop with hers. After a moment, his face lit up with laughter. \"Oh man, that actually freaked me out for a moment! You're such an artist!\" He squeezed her shoulders, smiling at me. \"Thanks, Noah.\" Cindy thanked me half-heartedly, not so psyched about the weird hand.\n\nAs I tore the paper out of the sketchbook and handed it to them, I couldn't help but wonder why I drew that. I don't recall doing soânot consciously at least. In all likelihood, I did it because I saw someone hold something and that image stuck with me. I wasn't sure why the hand looked so twisted, but I wasn't going to question the coincidence. It was just one of those weird moments, nothing more.\n\nStill, I couldn't get the hand out of my head. On the bus back home from school, I pulled out my sketchbook and began doodling the girl sitting in front of me. I wasn't the type to do this, but I needed to see if what happened was just a one-time occurrence. The drawing started off fine; she was wearing a dark coat and was staring at the phone in her hand, brown hair draping over her face. That should've been all that there was... But my hand continued to move.\n\nI began drawing another figure, this one far more inhumane, with decomposing skin, gnarly bones protruding from underneath. Slowly, its form became more apparent; though humanoid, it was obviously anything but human.\n\nIt was perched on the shoulders of the girl, head tilted with curiosity as it watched whatever the girl's phone was playing. Where eyes should've been were instead replaced by hollow sockets, flies entering and exiting. Its mouth, agape and forever held in an expression of shock, seemed to sag, the skin connecting the jaw and the skull teetering on the edge of ripping apart.\n\nDespite the fact I couldn't see it, I was able to draw the thing with extreme detail; each pore, each blemish, every wrinkle, each hair, everything about it was etched into the paper with perfect accuracy. Frantic, I flipped a page and drew the girl yet again, this time in far less detail. I realized that the constant scratching of lead on paper was disturbing the other passengers, but I couldn't stop.\n\nOnce the silhouette of the girl was finished, my hands yet again moved on their own, muscle memory guiding each careful stroke. The creature was yet again seated on the girl's shoulders, only now it wasn't looking at the girl's phone.\n\nIt was looking at me.\n\nOne final time, I flipped the page and scribbled an incoherent mess that barely resembled the girl. But the feeling of needing to continue the drawing ceased; the thing moved. In that instant, I hopped off at the next stop and dashed for my home, cradling the sketchbook to my chest. I frantically looked around, drawing the scenery in the hope that I'll be able to find that thing again.\n\nEach time I did, it would be there, either waiting for me with a curious tilted head or running along the roofs on all fours, still glaring right at me. Eventually, I reached my house. Once I spun around and locked the door behind me, I made a quick sketch of the door. To my horror, the urge to continue drawing once I finished continued, and the ghastly expression was printed behind the window. Somehow, despite the fact it had no eyes, I knew that it was making eye contact.\n\nScared beyond belief, I ran to my room, barricading it with my bed and dresser. Then, huddled in the corner on the opposite side of the door, I began filling the pages with drawing after drawing of the entrance. At first, there was nothing special in the first 30 or so pages. But then came those nails; those long, black talons that held the bottom of the door, trying to pry it open. It tried and tried, each drawing showing the thing's hands in a different position. I thought it would give up, but I'm on my third sketchbook now and it still hasn't let up.\n\nI'm writing this now to give my sore hands a break. It's beginning to wear the door down; nail marks cover the outer frame, splinters of wood are sticking out, and the paint itself has begun peeling away. Calling the police isn't an option, and the room doesn't have any windows; I can't leave.\n\nI don't know why I'm even bothering to post this. I guess it's some sort of last wish. I know this probably comes off as some sort of schizo rant, but it's not. There are things that don't live in our realm of existence. Maybe it was my fault for being so curious, putting my nose into places where it shouldn't go, but I couldn't help myself.\n\nIf you ever find the need to draw something that you can't see or feel, ignore it, keep your distance, put your pencil down, just for the love of God don't let it know you can see it, because it can see you.",

        "text": "I have a firm belief in intuitions and gut feelings. Iâve had so many occurrences in my life that I now have a hard time determining whether Iâm having a gut feeling or if Iâm playing out possible scenarios to be aware of what COULD happen. Itâs a stressful way of thinking, Iâll tell you that much. The story Iâm about to tell you isnât one of my SCARIEST moments, but itâs one of my most memorable moments. My intuition kept me safe. For starters, I worked at a salon in a pretty busy suburban town outside of Chicago. My shift ended at 9 and I couldnât wait to go home. I hopped in my car and headed down the same drive I took every single day for the last 4 years. I was in a hurry to get home because I had to be back at work at 8:00am the next morning so I wanted to go home and relax before having to go straight to bed. I was coming up to a light that I always would get stuck at. And like clock work, it turns yellow and then red. I get annoyed and decide Iâm going to turn left. Iâll get the green turn signal first before the main light turns green and maybe this route home will surprise me by being quicker than my usual route. So I carry on this different route home. Once I reach my town, I start heading to my go-to gas station to buy cigarettes. As I approached the station, I noticed it looked very empty. It was close to 10pm but typically this gas station always had at least two cars in attendance. Itâs strange to me. But I pull in and park. As I parked I checked the time and realized that driving that different route actually took me about 5 minutes longer than my usual route. I get out of the car and walk up to the door and pull it, but the door is locked. I look up and an employee opens it for me. I think nothing of it and walk in and I hear him lock it behind me. I feel very confused at this point. I see one employee behind the counter on the phone and she looks panicked. Then guy who unlocked the door for me ran behind the counter and grabbed me my cigarettes. He knew which kind because I was a regular. As Iâm paying I hear the woman on the phone say âwe need the police we were just robbed at gunpoint!â. I looked at the guy who unlocked the door for me and I said âwait, is that why the door was locked?â And he replied âyes and thatâs why I let you in and locked the door behind you, idk where that guy is and youâre safer in hereâ. I was stunned. I couldnât believe it. I was scared to be in the gas station but I was also scared to leave it. I waited to leave until the police arrived. But when I got to my car. I got inside, and sat there, still in disbelief. all I could think about was how my mind RANDOMLY told me to take a different way home tonight. That route took me 5 extra minutes. I arrived at the gas station 5 minutes later than I would have if I took my normal route. If I had taken my normal route, would I have been inside the gas station during the robbery? I felt so grateful that I was able to miss that incident completely and that nobody working was hurt! It was a mind blowing feeling.",

        "text": "\n[Part One](https://redd.it/10hione)\n\nâGet in.â\n\nThis was a week after we all almost died at Julia Raffertyâs house.  I hadnât spoken to them since they dropped me back off at my car, and I wasnât at all sure that I wanted to hear from them again.  Still, when Mrs. Graves had called and told me where to meet them, I went.  Partially because it was hard to tell them no, but also because I wanted answers.  And when Mr. Holliman told me to get in the car, I didnât move.\n\nâNo, hold up.  Before I go anywhere with you, weâre going to have a conversation.  About what happened.  About what exactly is going on.â\n\nHolliman sighed and rolled up the window before shutting off the ignition.  The two of them discussed things inside the car for a few seconds and then they got out together, looking at me in the detached way that I might notice a bug crawling over my shoe.  Swallowing, I forced myself to not take a step back or look away.  Instead, I focused on Mrs. Graves.\n\nâWhat happened?  To Julia, I mean.  Is she dead?â\n\nThe woman nodded somberly.  âShe is.  When they are strong enough to do it, when one of these creatures escapes, they always kill the host before they leave.  Iâm not sure, but I think itâs because they believe they can be forced back via the host.â  She gave a small shrug.  âWeâve never tried that, but we do know that on the rare occasion that we express the nightmare too lateâ¦after it has grown too strong, the host invariably dies, and on one occasion we saw one have a chance to escape and instead it went back to end the host.â  Her expression darkened.  âA mistake on that oneâs part, as it gave us the chance to capture it after all.â\n \nI frowned.  âSo you saved that personâ¦that host?â\n\nMr. Holliman cut in.  âNo, we used the distraction provided by it killing the host to bind it into the bag.â  Seeing my expression, he waved off my reproachful glance.  âNevermind being sanctimonious.  This is hard and dangerous work, and the risks we take make the world a better place, or will in time.  Iâm not going to apologize for doing whatever it takes.â\n\nGiving him an uncertain nod, a new thought occurred to me.  âSo what about her family?  Herâ¦her parents were in the living room when we took her in there.  Oh God.  Are they going to think we murdered her?â\n\nGraves shook her head.  âNot at all.  I texted one of our people to contact both them and emergency services as soon as we left that night.  The poor girl was found unresponsive and the death has been ruled natural due to heart failure.  Uncommon in one so young, but she had numerous documented health issues thanks to her passenger.  As for the family, they were naturally very upset at first, but theyâve come to understand there was nothing more we could have done.â\n\nI stared at her.  âWhat do you mean?  We leave a flooded room andâ¦and a broken window and their dead daughter and whatâ¦theyâre just cool with it?â\n\nHolliman shot me a dark look.  âNo one is âcoolâ with it.  But we went and spoke with them later and came to an agreement.â  His face broke into a small, cold smile.  âWeâll never hear from them again.â  \n\nSwallowing, I looked back to Graves.  âOkay.  Letâs say I believe all that.  And that I think weâre helping people, because overall, I do.  My next question is *what* are we actually doing?  What are those things?  Iâve asked before, but frankly Iâve never gotten a straight answer, and I think I deserve one.â\n\nGraves raised an eyebrow.  âWe âdeserveâ very little in this life.  And you are far from being in a position to make demands.  You either want to continue on with our work, or you wish to end your employment here.  That choice is entirely yours.â\n\nI did look down then, though less to avoid their gaze than to study my own interior.  I was afraid, and I didnât know how much I could really trust what they were telling me.  And that poor girl had *died*, as had apparently others in the past.\n\nOn the other hand, they had been trying to help the girl, hadnât they?  And had they ever done anything to hurt anyone or been bad to me?  No, not really.  Theyâd always been strange and tight-lipped, but they treated me well enough.  And if the work really was importantâ¦\n\nMr. Holliman stepped forward with a grimace.  âLook, kid.  You have a good heart and mind.  We can see that.  See your potential.  And weâre not trying to be unreasonable about any of this.â  He gave me a small smile.  âBut this stuffâ¦it *is* important.  And dangerous.  And while we wouldnât be working with you if we didnât trust you, there are levels of trust.  We canât just open the doors wide for everyone we run across.   Not until we know youâre going to work out long-term.  You understand, donât you?â\n\nI nodded as I held his gaze.  âI guess I do.  I donât like it, but I get it at least.â\n\nHis smile widened.  âGood.  Then how about we get back toâ¦â\n\nâHow many?â\n\nHis expression darkened again as Mrs. Graves stepped forward and put a hand on his shoulder.  âHow many what?â\n\nâHow many helpers have you had before me?â\n\nHollimanâs face fell a little, and his eyes grew sad.  âThree.â\n\nMouth dry, I forced myself to go on.  âAnd how many of them died doing this stuff with you?â\n\nMrs. Gravesâ voice trembled slightly as she spoke.  âAll of them.â\n\nSuppressing a shudder, I let out a long breath.  âOkay.  Wellâ¦thatâs terrifying.  But at least I believe you.  And for nowâ¦for now I guess thatâs enough.  So letâs go.â\n\n**** \n\nWe drove for two hours in relative quiet before arriving at the loft apartment of Wallace Minter.  Wallace was a fifty-two year old investment banker that had started having profound night terrors the year before.  At first heâd attributed it to normal stressâheâd gotten a divorce eight months earlier and his normally intense job had become even more tightly-wound lately.  But when he woke up one night curled up in the corner of his kitchen, knuckles bloody from where heâd been punching dents into his fridgeâ¦well, he knew he needed something more than a sleeping pill.  The start had been doctors and therapists, but things kept getting worse instead of better, and by the time we showed up at his door, heâd been on âmedical leaveâ from work for over two weeks.\n\nI knew this because Mr. Holliman and Mrs. Graves knew this.  They normally only told me the name of the person we were visiting before we arrived, but this time it was different.  As we parked, Mrs. Graves began telling me these details.  I was interestedâboth in the information itself and this sudden expansion of what I was being toldâbut it also made me curious.  I waited until she seemed finished with her summary of Wallace and then I asked my question.\n\nâWhy are you telling me this?  I mean, Iâm very interested and I appreciate you sharing more with me, but why now?â\n\nMr. Holliman glanced up in the rearview mirror at me in the back seat.  âBecause maybe youâre right and itâs time you knew a bit more.  But more than that, itâs because youâve passed a milestone.  Two, in fact.   You faced the expression of one of these things when they were strong and ready, and youâre still alive.â\n\nSwallowing, I nodded.  âOkay.  And whatâs the other milestone?â\n\nHis eyes crinkled slightly as he grinned.  âAfter everything youâve seen, you still got back in the car.â\n\n**** \n\nWhen he opened the door, Wallace Minter looked like weâd interrupted his crawl to a grave.  Heâd been a heavy-set man at one point, but now pallid, greasy flesh hung loose on his cheeks and he had the ropy aroma of layers of old sweat and illness.  I half-expected him to sound hoarse or congested when he spoke, but his voice was surprisingly smooth and deep.\n\nâYes?  What do you want?â\n\nMrs. Graves gave him a smile.  âWeâre here to help you, Mr. Minter.  We were referred byâ¦â\n\nâNo. No more doctors.  Bunch of goddamn charlatans.  All you all want is money.  And now youâre showing up at my door?â\n\nMr. Holliman leaned forward, his voice calm and soothing.  âWe are not doctors.  And while we charge a nominal fee, that is not why we do this.  We do this to help.â\n\nWallace furrowed his brow at him.  âSo not even doctors.  What?  Fucking snake-oil salesmen?  Faith healers?â  He started to shut the door.  âThanks but no thaâ¦â He looked down as the door stopped, and seeing my foot there, he stared back up at me with weak outrage.  âGet out of here before I call the fuckingâ¦â\n\nâYouâre going to die in there.â\n\nHe stopped, blinking.  âWhat did you say?â\n\nI held his gaze as I went on.  âI said youâre going to die in there.  If you donât get help for this thing inside of you, thatâs keeping you from sleeping, thatâs keeping you scared and angry all the time, it *will* wind up killing you.â\n\nHis face went slack as tears welled up in his eyes.  âHow do you know?â\n\nI gestured back at Holliman and Graves.  âBecause they know.  And because Iâve worked with them long enough to know that they can save people like you.  People that no one else can help.â\n\nHis face was swimming in emotions nowâfear and anger, but also a kind of anxious, fragile hope.  âYouâre saying they can help me?â \n\nI took in a deep breath, trying to find the right words.  Confident, but honest, without letting on that I halfway wanted him to tell us no because I was shit-scared of being in a sealed room with whatever he had inside him.\n\nâIâm saying that we will try our best.  And that our best is probably the best shot you have left.â\n\nLips trembling, he nodded and stepped aside.  âOkay.  Iâ¦Come on in.â\n\nI looked over at my bossesâwhen Iâd been talking to him, it had never occurred to me that theyâd want me to shut up or think I was overstepping my bounds.  Now that it did, I searched their faces for anger or irritation.\n\nInstead I saw fear.\n\nA look passed between them as Iâd first turned.  It was quick, and they covered it as soon as they saw I was watching them, but it had been there.  Some silent communication, a shared emotion ofâ¦what?  Worry?  Terror?  Something in-between, maybe.  I felt the air in my chest go thin at that look, but I forced myself to speak.\n\nâIs that okay with the two of you?â\n\nMrs. Graves gave me a weak smile.  âCertainly.  Lead the way.â\n\nI felt a little relieved at that, but only a little.  Something was definitely wrong, but I didnât understand what.  Ducking my head a little, I edged past them to the stairwell.  âIâ¦Iâll go get the stuff up.â\n\n**** \n\nThirty minutes later the contract was signed and the room was sealed.  Iâd expected Wallace to question or argue against the stranger parts of our process, but apparently his resistance at the door had used the last of his strength.  That got me to thinking and I pulled Mrs. Graves aside before we took him into the room.\n\nâAre you sure we arenâtâ¦you knowâ¦too late?  I mean he really does look like heâs at the end of his rope.  What if itâs been in there too long?  Gotten too strong?  What if itâs like last time?â\n\nHer eyes were troubled as she looked away.  âItâs a fair question. A good question that Iâm proud of you for asking.  And a good answer would be that I donât know for sure.â\n\nHeart pounding, I pushed on.  âWould that be the honest answer?â\n\nShe glanced past me and let out a short sigh.  âPartially.  But a more fully honest answer would be that either way, I donât know that we have a choice.â\n\nI stared at her.  âWhat?  What does that mean?â\n\nLicking her lips, she gave a small shrug.  âWe have certain obligations.  And our failure last week has set us back.â  Graves shook her head slightly.  âThis isnât the time or place for this.  Letâs get this done.  No mistakes for any of us, understand?â\n\nI started to respond, but she was already moving past me toward where Holliman was coming out of the bedroom with a questioning look.  She waved it away, telling him that we were ready to begin.  He glanced at me and despite the twisting in my stomach, I nodded.  It was just nerves and excitement, I told myself.  Everything was going to be fine this time.\n\nLooking back on it now, thereâs a part of me that wishes I could go back and stop that past self from gripping Wallaceâs shoulder and leading him into that bedroom.  Tell that earlier me that nothing was worth what came after, and that it all could have been avoided if instead of taking him into the bedroom Iâd just listened to my fears and walked away right then and there.\n\nI think the me of twenty minutes later, when Mrs. Graves had already given Wallace the injection and Mr. Holliman was trying to finish the Story while that horrible buzzing noise grew to a fever pitchâ¦that me would have listened.  Especially when the buzzing stopped and Wallaceâs head split open, vomiting out the black squirming thing with too many faces and eyes.  \n\nI still remember the moment when it raised its head and looked at me.  I felt my pants grow wet, but I wasnât embarrassed.  All I knew in that moment was that I was about to die.\n\nI think *that* past me would have listened to just about anything I told him.  Even if I let slip that no, youâll get out of that room without a scratch, he still would have done just about anything to not feel so scared for another single second.  And if I told him that it wasnât too late, that he could still walk away from it all of it.  Not just Wallace, but Holliman and Graves, the nightmares, everything.  Just walk away free and clean if I just did it *now*â¦I think maybe that earlier self would have believed me and tried to do just that.\n\nI can still see that thing crawling down Wallaceâs legs, chittering from a dozen mouths on its misshapen, piebald head, a cold intelligence dancing in its oildrop eyes as it drew closer to my position at the foot of the bed.  Holliman had opened the sack now and Graves was trying to whistle, but it only had eyes for me.\n\nIâd tell that terrified me that it was okay.  That I could still get away from not only this thing but everything that would follow.  That there was still time to stop what was coming.\n\nAnd it would be a lie.\n\n[Because as I would come to realize, it was already far, far too late.](https://redd.it/10h9jfw)",

        "text": "I grew up on the bluffs that overlook Lake Erie. I was always enamored by the vastness, beauty, and mystery of what can only be describes as an inland sea.  As a small child, the thought that across the waters out of eyesight their lays another country fascinated me. Between the lakes south shore and her Northern Canadian shore lay the ruins of countless shipwrecks, mysteries, and plethora aquatic life. These romantic imaginations of adventure, foreign lands, and mystery contrasted sharply with the dark and eerie history of the land overlooking the water.\n\nJust as the feelings conjured up by the lake contrasted with those from the land, so did the personality of my father with that of my grandfathers. My dad taught me to fish on the lake, how to sail, and how to scuba dive. My dad would tell me stories about his adventures as a young man on its waters; he would tell me about the lakes amazing history and about the magic of life.  My grandfather taught me to hunt, how to stalk white tailed deer in the woods, and how to shoot. He told me stories about wars; both in the distant past and nearer the present, about death, and the dark history of the land. He taught me about the darker side of life. \n\n\"Do you know what happened her in the 1600s?\" My grandfather asked as he opened a can of Copenhagen snuff, his Marlin 30-30 rifle resting in the crook of one elbow and armpit of his other.  \n\n\"No? You mean about the Erie Indians grandpa?\" I looked up at him, his dark green eyes, piercing like a hawk as he looked down at me, filling his lip with the tobacco. He shook his head as he brushed the brown residue from his fingers onto his blaze orange pant leg. \"Thats right son, the Cat People and their enemies, the Iroquois.\" \n\nIt was early December in Pennsylvania and for many families like mine that means one thing, Deer rifle season. I was now 15 and this year was my 5th season going out with my grandfather.  I had been going out with him since I was about ten years old, not old enough to actually hunt but old enough to tag along.  He taught me much about the land, the wildlife, and the more practical aspects of deer hunting.  Along with that wealth of woodsman knowledge and craft came the less desirable thoughts for my young mind to ponder. The stories and \"lessons\" seemed to get darker every season.\n\nMy grandfather had served in the Korean war as an infantryman in the 1st Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment. He was wounded during the fighting and received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star with Valor for his actions during the battle. I know from my dad that part of the reason my grandfather was the way that he was had to do with those experiences.  I now understand that he suffered from what is called PTSD.  \n\nIt was cold out, in the mid-thirties that morning as me and my grandfather walked deeper into the woods.  There was a light dusting of snow on the ground and underneath, a litter of leaves. We walked staggered up the hill from where we first entered the woods, my grandfather slightly ahead and to the right of me. \n\n\"there's a place I want to show you today. It's a place I took your dad when he was about your age. It's just up this knoll.\" My grandfather led the way up the small hill. \"Old timers called it totem mound.\" He barked as we walked farther in the woods.  The slope was covered in hemlock, pine, and birch trees.  As we crested the top, a large depression lay before us about 30 yards in diameter.  In the center of this bowl-shaped depression sat a large flat rock about 10 feet across with a round notch in the center.  On the other side of the bowl was another 50 yards of flat land and then a cliff.  Beyond the cliff was the lake, not yet frozen. I stood at the edge of the bowl and peered out to the lake.\n\nMy grandfather was making his way down into the center of the depression, waving for me to come down and take a look. \"This is where the Erie burned an Onondaga chief to avenge the death of 30 of their men, what was meant to be a wedding turned into a BBQ.\"  My grandfather knelt down, prodding at the notch in the rock while telling the story of the tracheary of the Iriqous and their slaughter of the Erie who had come to broker a peace. The final attempts at diplomacy when the Erie offered a woman for marriage to the Onondaga chief in exchange for peace, the women's refusal, and the revenge that ultimately led to the chief being burned at the stake and a war of genocide that would wipe the Cat People of this land forever.  \n\nI got chills as my grandfather told me about the last words the Onondaga chief spoke, about the curse he had put on this land and whoever would dwell on it as he burned alive. \"...and it was right here, right at this spot where they stripped him of his festal robes and bound him to a stake.\" Grandpa said, still poking at the blackened, round notch with a stick, the greater portion of the behemoth stone now covered in green moss.\n\n\"Grandpa, whatever deer where around are now long gone thanks to your wild story.\" I said, half smiling but not as amused as my face would have him believe. I stood there, wanting to shake my head. *I wanted to hunt, not listen to ghost stories*.\n\nMy grandfather stood up and looked me right in the eyes. \"This land is cursed son! Its why got shrapnel in by body, why your uncle Denny got drafted and sent to Vietnam to die, its why your grandmother is dead in the ground, and its why your aunt can't stop drinking!\"  Grandpa was now in my face, his eyes piercing into mine, I felt my mouth go dry and a surge of adrenaline as he staired at me, not blinking at all.  \"it's why I brought you here, just as I brought your father before you. I want you to know why this family is a failure so that maybe someday you can get out of here before it takes you out.\"\n\nAt this point I was starting to get a little scared.  Here I have my crazy grandfather yelling at me in the woods with his deer rifle in his hand, blaming some ancient legend for the misfortunes of our family. I thought about what he said. Uncle Denny died in Vietnam, and I never even met him. My father never really knew him.  My dad was born in 1965 and would have only been three when his oldest brother was killed in Vietnam.  My aunt, the youngest was born after.  Grandpa wanted to join the Marines; going to Korea was not the fault of some curse. Grandma died at the ripe old age of 80 from cancer, and Aunt Becky drank but I never thought of her as having a problem with Alcohol.  \n\n\"Grandpa, your scarring me, are you like going to have a flashback and shoot me out here in the woods?\" I said, laughing, hoping he would turn down his tone a little bit.  It seemed to do the trick.  He shook his head, smiled and said \"Iam sorry son, I just want you to have a better life then we had.\" \n\nMy grandfather reached into his pocket and examined it. \" I took this when I was a boy.\" He held a small icon in his hand, a rock in the rough shape of what looked to be a turtle. \"I found it here in 1938 when I would come out in these woods, I have always wanted to return it but for some reason I just can't bring myself to do it.\" \n\nHe looked down at the rock in his hand, only looking away and closing his palm around it when I went to grab it. \"No, son!\" he said, jerking his hand back and sticking the rock back in his pocket. He looked back behind him at the large rock in the center of the depression. \"Today is the day I put it back in the ground. I couldn't do it in 1960 with your uncle Denny, I couldn't do it with your dad in 1970, and I couldn't do it last season before your grandmother died.\" Without him saying it, I understood. He believed taking this rock caused some kind of curse on our family, just like the land was supposedly cursed by the chief.  *Who knows if this curse is real or imagined, but maybe this will help grandpa have some peace.* I shook my head in agreement with him. Grandpa walked a few yards to the edge of the large rock, knelt down and slid the effigy into the semi frozen earth. \n\nIt wasn't but a few days later when the dreams started.  Terrible dreams. They would always start off the same way.  Me, floating down through the treetops onto Totem Mound. I slowly fall down towards the rock in the depression at the top of the mound.  The sounds of drums start to beat, pulsing through my body as I slowly fall face down over the rock.  I stop and hover, the charred, black hole of the notch comes at me; at first slowly than and a great speed.\n\nI can't move my body as I fall into a black void, the drums get louder and louder and then flames burst all around me.  A terrible sight flashes before my eyes.  At first it is the sight of a tall, strong, fierce looking man.  His face is stoic but his eyes pierce into me, like he can read my thoughts.  I feel like a kid who is now in front of his father, explaining why he did what he was not supposed to do.  All my secrets laid bare before him.  Then it happens. \n\nThe fierce looking man takes on the form of a reptile. The head morphs into a hideous shape, like a turtle but more intimidating.  The Native warrior takes on a form of a nightmare.  I think of the stories and conspiracies about the reptilians, this is something else, something far more archaic and primal.  I hear my grandfather's words \"I took this when I was a boy\" echo in my ears above the sounds of the drums and I wake up, drenched in a cold sweat.\n\nThat year, 2008 was the last time I ever hunted with my grandfather and the first and last time I went to Totem Mound. That spring my grandfather passed away.  He was buried in Wintergreen Gorge cemetery in Erie County Pennsylvania. Shortly after he passed my father brought me a small box. \n\nThe box was an old Dixie Maid cigar box with some old papers, my grandfather's medals, a couple photos from his time in the Marines and fishing out on the lake back in the 70's with my dad.  Old mementos.  Also in the box was the effigy, the turtle looking rock that I had thought he placed back into the cursed ground of Totem Mound. I got chills, closed the box and gave it back to my dad. \"I can't keep this dad; you should hold on to them.\"\n\nIt's been 15 years since then, but the nightmares have not stopped. They have actually gotten worse. I found out through research that the beef between the Iriqouis Nation, and the Erie may have had something to do with sacred practices being violated by the Erie, the Cat People.  The turtle was not just some effigy, it was a totem belonging to a clan, a symbol of a guardian to a family and a people. \n\nNow in my dreams, as my grandfather's voice echos over the drums, the fierce reptilian humanoid unleashes his minions to devour my flesh, maybe even my soul.  The demonic turtles tear away skin and muscle, fat and sinew from my bones.  Sometimes when I wake up, I see shadows in the room. I even thought I heard the faint beat of war drums one night as I drifted off to sleep.   \n\nI have tried everything. I have tried sleep aides from NyQuil to Ambien to no avail.  I have talked to therapists, doctors.  I have even thought about taking the effigy back myself, but I just can't do it. I can't let it go.  I need to get out of this town.  Will these nightmares follow me?      \n\n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"",

        "text": "*I am a collector of vintage and lost news media. After acquiring a collection of old, small-town papers from a tiny library that was shuttering its doors, one piece stuck out to me. It was not dated and faded like the rest of the collection- it looked like I had bought it that morning. It contained the most unusual subject matter, and I would have passed it off as some work of outsider art, if not for the images contained within, and the unsettling events unfolding in the wake of my attempts to find the source of this article. Perhaps you too, dear reader, will come to believe in the events at Grouse Springs, or maybe you will dismiss it as so many others have. As I had, initially. Maybe it is easier to continue living as if nothing like this could change our daily life. I fear it already has.*  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n# Blast Radius: An investigation into the tragedy and coverup of Grouse Springs\n\n \n\nby Douglas Ray Cleavon\n\nPublished August 2021\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Part One: an Interview**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn one afternoon, Grouse Springs, Virginia went from being a sleepy farming town to a place soaked in infamy. It is now spoken almost exclusively  in the company of names such as Three Mile Island, Fukushima, and Chernobyl. Residents across the East Coast remember June 23rd, 2016 as a day of unique terror, forced to take shelter in Cold War-era bomb shelters, while the rest of the country recalls fear of threats to our capital city, evacuation, panic. 1,437 lives lost, some with bodies that still havenât been found, even years later. 1,437 friends, children, loved ones. Gone.\n\nThe Grouse Springs Nuclear Plantâs official statement claimed that the plant had experienced a loss-of-coolant incident at the hands of some negligent employee who had mistakenly stopped the flow, causing the pipes to burst from heat and the dangerously outdated graphite tips to catch fire and begin a nuclear meltdown. The fire spread rapidly to the town, and due to a delayed warning system, not everyone had time to make it out. All 532 employees of the power plant were killed, as well as 408 first responders, and 497 civilians living in Grouse Springs itself. \n\nFortunately, as the story goes, military assistance stepped in to assure no more radiation spread, and that no more lives were lost. Video footage still exists on the internet, taken by survivors returning to salvage belongings, of people who had burned to death in their cars for leaving just seconds too late. \n\nThose who died at Grouse Springs died badly. Even those who survived the initial danger werenât safe, dying weeks later of radiation poisoning, skin sloughing off. Pets and livestock were killed, and acres of beautiful Virginia old-growth forest had to be razed. \n\nFortunately, as the story goes, the danger will pass. Life will return, eventually. Forests will grow back. Although those who died could not be replaced, survivors were given a hefty sum of government money to try to build a new life, and move on. Many of the survivors of Grouse Springs were reluctant to speak to the media, both civilians and first responders alike. Understandably so; even years canât do the trauma associated with such a terrible loss of life.\n\nSome alleged witnesses, however, claim that the payout was merely to buy their silence. Lead-lined coffins hide bodies very, very well. \n\nViral videos posted on social media before technology began to fail depicts scenes of violence not able to be attributed to radiation poisoning or panic. Animals were seen in the days after damaged in ways that seemed closer to genetic defects than the result of injury. Reports of wildlife that had fused, of plants that thrashed and screamed, of figures looming out of fire. \n\nA user on the conspiracy forum TruthSeekrs going by â98765grousespringsâ made a post on March 4th of last year, stating âI was at GrouseSprings, no blue light, no cherenkov radiation,â followed five minutes later by âno cherenkov=nowater=no burstpipes.â The account, and subsequently the posts, were deleted twenty-four hours later. However, a second account showed up by the name of âgrouusespringsmassacreâ, this time on the popular photosharing site Instagram, claiming to be 98765grousesprings, sending screencaps to hundreds of users with the original tweets, captioned, âthey deleted my account anyone who says they saw a regular fire there r lying.â The grouusespringsmassacre account was deleted, again, 24 hours later.  \n\nAlthough this user was likely just buying into conspiracy, there was one factor that made this post notable. The image used as the account's profile picture was from Grouse Springs, the day of the massacre, and it had never been published before. Many groups outright rejected my attempts at contact, and others still were cold, hostile, or otherwise disinterested. Still, I persisted. There was *something* here, so I ran an advertisement, pooling money to run an advertisement campaign.\n\nThis remained unsuccessful for months, alternating between long periods of silence and pranksters. That was, until I received a phone call on my personal phone from a man I had never spoken to before.  He contacted me around four in the morning and I answered bleary-eyed, glasses still tucked away on the nightstand. \n\nâCleavon Residence.â\n\nI heard shuffling on the other end of the line, before a quiet voice said, âIs this Douglas?â\n\nâYes. To whom am I speaking?â\n\nâIâm uh- my nameâs Pete Kitts. I saw your ad online a while ago and I could use the money if you still got it,â he was so quiet that I could barely hear him, but I was instantly awake, quickly grabbing my glasses and a pen and paper to write down a time and place to meet.\n\nâ-\n\nPeter J. Kitts, or Pete, as he styles himself, is a big guy. Not in stature, but in everything else. Pete has a big laugh, a big personality, big boots, and at the age of thirty, a big gambling problem. Thatâs why he contacted me, he said. \n\nâWell, I was out rent money for the week, since I was down at the tracks all day the Sunday before and uh, I saved your number just in case I needed something on the side,â Petey explained, as he showed me the paperwork proving that he indeed received settlement money from the Grouse Springs accident. âItâs all gone.â \n\nWe ended up meeting at a hotel cafe, neither of us wanting to introduce stories of Grouse Springs to our homes. The idea still felt taboo, as if we would be invoking it at our place of living if we so much as mentioned it there. \n\nI started my tape recorder, setting it between us.\n\nPete Kitts arrived at a local bar owned by a couple who happened to be out of town on July 23rd, around 7pm the day of the accident. By 9:45 pm, everyone who remained in the bar was dead. The fire had spread to the town proper, through the thick trees and undergrowth surrounding the powerplant, and by 8:12 pm, beginning to engulf the businesses and homes of the residents of Grouse Springs. Emergency services had begun moving people out as quickly as possible. Kitts himself was rescued by a civilian vehicle, a good Samaritan trying to fit as many people in as possible. Exiting the building, Pete could see the smoke trailing from the direction of the trees, accompanied by a smell he described as âmetallic.â\n\nâI was in this bar, yâknow? Nailheadâs, right by the corner of 52nd and West, out with my buddies after work. And Iâm looking, well- nothingâs wrong with looking at the girls, right? As long as Iâm not buying drinks for them. And my coworker Dave says to me, âWhy donât you buy that brunette over there a drink?â Iâm sitting there thinking, man, Angelica would be so pissed if I did that, so I tell him, âMy girlfriend, she doesnât want me doing that shit.â So then Dave says, âOh, so youâre letting the Titless Wonder make decisions for you now?â That fucking pissed me off, so I was about to say something, but then I noticeâ¦â\n\nWith this, the previously animate Pete set his jaw and looked out the window, like he was struggling not to cry. He furrowed his brows, hard, and put his hand on his chin. \n\nâWhat did you notice, Pete?â\n\nHe swallowed before continuing, voice shaky, â...I notice, that brunette went real still. Not just like, standing still, but real still. \n\nShe wasnât even breathing. Her hair was frozen too, like someone had set her on pause right in the middle of dancing. \n\nAnd then there was thisâ¦ bulge in her stomach. Like a pregnant lady. But it wasnât there before. And Iâm staring at her, and Dave tries to get my attention before he sees what Iâm staring at and then heâs staring at her too. And then her friends notice and theyâre all screaming and the music cuts off and nobody knows what the hell to do because something is obviously wrong with the chick but how are you supposed to call an ambulance when you donât even know whatâs happening to her? And the bulge starts moving- moving up, like traveling from her stomach up to her chest, and you could see her bones cracking, and her friends are shaking her, trying to get her to unfreeze or wake up or whatever, and theyâre crying and screaming, and Dave just whispers, 'What the fuck, man?'\n\nSo I called 911. Nobody answered. I think that was about the time the rest of the town was going to shit, too, so ainât nobody there to answer the phoneâ¦ but I doubtâd made a difference anyway, with what happened to her. \n\nSee, that bulge just kept growing up, up her neckâ¦ God, it was fuckinâ awful. And these hands just, came out of her mouth, one grabbinâ each jaw and it-... they just, peeled her. All inside out, blood everywhere, her guts spilling all over the floor. Smelled fucking awful, too. Few of her friends threw up, hell, *I* wanted to throw up. \n\nIt felt like it was going on forever, her body just opening and opening and opening. And nobody could see what was inside, and I was thinking shit, itâs a fucking face-hugger, now weâre all gonna split in half and die.\n\nBut it was just her, man. Once all the skin and meat was on the floor, it was just that same brunette, covered in blood, unfrozen. It was just her. And she was still dancing.â",

        "author": "Torvi_1",

        "text": "I am 49 years old, 50 in only a couple of months. Too old to be frightened of the stories my grandmother told me during the long winter nights, when my parents were visiting their friends and it was just two of us sitting in front of the fire.  I shouldnât even remember them. And yet, I still avert my gaze from the bathroom mirror if I happen to be there between midnight and three oâclock in the morning.  Iâve heard people refer to those hours as the witching hours. My grandmother never called them that or any other name. When I asked her âWhy shouldnât I look in the mirror at that time of night?â, she just shrugged her shoulders and simply said: âBecause they look back. And once they see youâ¦â. \n\n \nShe left the rest of the sentence hanging there, unfinished, unspoken, in the space between us. She didnât need to say it, we both knew what she was speaking off. \n\n\nLike I said, I am too old to be thinking about silly stories told by an elderly woman to entertain and, in equal measure frighten, a gullible child. Itâs not her stories that stop me looking in the mirror in the middle of the night. For that, I have stories of my own.\n\n\nThere is a basement under my fatherâs house, as large as the whole footprint of the ground floor. There is no way to access it from the house itself. For that I would have to go out of our front door, turn right at the corner of the house and then descend the steep concrete steps, eleven of them, to the gloomy space under our home. I hated that basement. It was dark and cold and smelled funny. Worst of all thatâs where She was. An old woman who lived in that basement. No, not lived, as she wasnât a living creature, yet she occupied that space as fully and as easily as she occupied and terrorised my childhood. The memory of her goes all the way back to my earliest recollections, she was always there, lurkingâ¦ waitingâ¦ \n\n\nShe was my first. In the beginning it was just this unsettling presence that was concentrated at the bottom right corner of the basement. The space there appeared slightly darker compared to the rest of the room, like the light itself struggled to penetrate it all the way through. Over the next few weeks it seems to grow bigger, spreading further into the room, claiming more of the space for itself. It felt fuller, heavier, gaining mass and a shape, until I was able to see her in the corner of my eye. You all know what I am talking about; that moment when you brain says: âWait, what was that?!â and your eyes are trying to focus on the fast, blurry image that flashed by, just at the periphery of your vision. \n\n\nAt first, my primal fear seems to satisfy her. I would sense her menacing presence and would immediately break into tears. I would call out to my mother or my father and tried to explain what I saw. I would beg them not to ask me to go down there! Nobody believed me, of course. âYou are just a scared child with vivid imaginationâ they would say. But as I grew, so did her need for my terror.\n\n She wasnât there all the time. Sometimes, there would be a month that passed by, possibly even longer, just long enough for me to stop looking over my shoulder and start hoping that it was over. Maybe I imagined it allâ¦ Then the torment would start all over again, stronger than before. Few of these incidents were particularly terrifying, and even after all these years I still remember the details with crystal clarity. \n\nOne summer evening, I could not have been older then 10, I walked up the few stairs leading to my parentsâ front door, I opened the door and entered the long hallway that led to the living room. I remember that it was unusually bright moon that evening, I could see clearly the entire hallway, so I didnât bother to switch the light on. It has been a while since I saw her last, so she wasnât at the forefront of my mind. As I approached the living room door the sense of dread suddenly washed over me, my skin breaking into goosebumps and cold, tingly electric shock run down my spine.  I could feel her before I had a chance to see her and as I looked up, I saw her pale face looming right above me! This was the first time that I saw her so clearly. That night her face was permanently etched into my brain. I can see it now; her skin had a yellowish, waxy shine to it and her face was lined with deep creases. I could plainly see the droopy folds above and under her pale, grey eyes. Her hair was shoulder length, black but heavily peppered with grey hairs, uncombed and unruly. She was smiling; no, not smiling, more like grinning at me. Something just wasnât right about it. Her lips were thin, stretched over her gums and exposing too many teeth. The worst of all was yet to come as that wide grin stretched wider, impossibly wide, and the high-pitched scream filled my ears and my head.    \n\n\nI run outside as fast as my ten-year-old legs would carry me. I remember willing them on to move as they felt wooden and so very, very heavy.  I could hear my parents and their friends gathered around the barbecue at the very bottom of the garden, happily chattering away, completely oblivious to the horror I was living through at that very moment. I sprinted towards them. I almost made it too. I was just about to round the corner of the house when she was right in front of me again with that horrible scream coming out of that wide gap on her face that shook every nerve in my body. I tripped and fell onto the sharp corner brick of the house, cutting a deep gash into my chin. By the time I reached my parents front of my t-shirt was soaked in blood. I ended up with three stitches in my chin and all these years later that scar is still visible and permanent reminder of Her.  \n\n\nAfter that the game was on. She would come and go as she pleased. She was no longer constrained just to the basement, she was free to roam the house and torment me. The only other member of the family that would catch at least a glance of her was my grandmother. I, however, seemed to be her favourite toy. My terror fed her. \n\n\nMy bedroom was at the far end of the house, I liked it there, the distance from the other bedrooms in the house offered a much needed privacy from the rest of the family as it hid my nocturnal screams and sobs to some degree. My bed was pushed against the wall, lengthwise, under the large window. That left three sides of it open. On the nights she would come, she would start pacing at the top of the bed, then down the full length of it until she finally stopped at my feet. And then back up again. Her steps would be slow and deliberate. Now and then she would pause in her pacing, and I would strain my young ears, hiding under the bed covers, trying to figure out has she finally left me in peace for the night. More often than not, the pacing resumed shortly after with increased intensity and the taunting continued like the previous, countless nights. Now and then, she would yank on my hair that was protruding out from under the duvet, and I would scream and scream. My parents were at the end of their patience with my night shenanigans, as they put it. Maybe I needed professional help, after all, arenât I too old to be crying at night?! I learned to bite down on the pillow and smother the screams on the nights that she was in particularly vicious and playful mood. She would keep me awake night after night, periodically pacing, whispering or screaming in my ears. And the life went on. \n\n   \nTwo days before I left my parentsâ house, she made sure to send me off with a parting gift. I was 18 years old, and I havenât seen her for a long time, at least a year. I finally grew out of my imagination, or so I told myself. That night I went to sleep and few hours later something woke me up. I sat up in bed and listened to the quiet groans and noises that all old houses make, but apart from those familiar sounds all was quiet. I laid back down, covered my head with the duvet and was ready to go back to sleep, when suddenly, the loud scream bounced inside my head. It did not come through my ears, this horrifying scream just stuffed my brain, so fully and completely that there was no room left for a single, coherent thought!  Then something pulled my hair, so hard that I felt my scalp lifting off my skull. The bedcovers were yanked off me in one sleek motion. The room was icily cold. I jumped and threw myself at the direction of the light switch, but where once was an empty space between me and the wall with the light switch on, was now occupied by Her. I wasnât a child anymore, I was tall enough that my eyes were on the level with hers. I saw her hooded grey eyes staring at me, the pure malice shining in them, and then I heard the familiar scream wailing out of that wide grinning mouth. I felt her bony fingers closing around my wrists, squeezing harder and harder. Somehow I managed to rip myself away from her grip and hit the light switch, and her face vanished with the bright light filling the room. But I could still hear the screams, it took me a minute to realise that I was the one screaming. \n\n\nI cannot describe to you the sense of relief I had when I left my parentsâ home. I was tired of her, and I was tired of doubting my own sanity because of her.\n\n\nI never saw her again. I was away from a family home for couple of years and when I came back, she was gone. Maybe she moved on looking for another child to terrorise or maybe my absence starved her of pure fear she fed on and was forced to return to the hell she crawled out of. I donât know and I donât want to know. I was ready to write her off as a figment of an overactive, childish imagination that lingered around for way too long, until my grandmother said to me: âMy poor child, none of my other children see them. I though it stopped with me, but it didnât. It just skipped a generation.â \n\n\nLike I said at the beginning of this story, she was my first. Many, many followed. Most of them were just lost and searching for their loved ones, some completely unaware that they are dead, some trapped here by their own pain. Few were like her, feeding of the fear of the living. But that is a story for another time. Something more important is on my mind.\nI have three children now, two sons and a daughter. I was hoping that it stopped with me, or maybe they were lucky and it skipped a generationâ¦\n\n\nWhen my middle son was around 6 years old, roughly the same age I was when I saw Her for the first time, he started waking up screaming in the night. \n\nâItâs just night terrors honeyâ, I would tell him while hugging his trembling little body close to me, âitâs a bad dream, that is all. Mama is here, donât be afraid. What did you see?â \n\nâI saw a little boy mamaâ he said, âand he asked me to swap lives with him. His life for mine.â \n\n\nThe only thing I could tell him throughout his childhood was this: \nâJust remember, do NOT look in the mirror after midnight and before 3 oâclock in the morning. Some call them witching hours. I donât have a name for them. I just know thatâs the time they look back. And once they see youâ¦ â",

        "text": "Hi everyone. I need help. A couple hours ago I came home from a full day at work. After watching tv for an hour or 2 I went to bed. \n\nOn my nightstand, I found an envelope. Not just an ordinary envelope. A black envelope with a white skull on it, which already terrified me. I live alone, and I am the only one that has the keys for this house. All windows and doors were fully locked and there were no signs of burglary, so this cannot be some sick prank. Also, the envelope certainly wasnât mine. Iâve written down the letter in full right beneath here. Please read it, I am horrified. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nHello there. Do you remember all those times that you were scared when trying to fall asleep? Scared that something might crawl through your window in the middle of the night, or that you would suddenly hear a knock on your door which isnât coming from your parents? Or maybe you were scared that that thing under your bed might creep out, not realizing that that thing under your bed wouldn't bother to show itself, it would rather just grab your ankles and pull you under the bed so it can eat you alive. \n\nYour parents always said that you would be fine and that there was nothing to worry about. That was a lie. They forgot about me. Iâm that car you didnât see, the virus that almost killed you, even though you didnât notice a thing. Iâm that lightning bolt which almost took your plane down, that heart attack you narrowly escaped, that shadow in the corner of your room. Still, naive as you are, you believed your parents and so you tried to relax and eventually you started a botherless sleep, every time again. \n\nNow you probably think that Iâm kidding, because you're old enough to know that there is nothing under your bed, and that there will be no-one at your bedroom door tonight. Thatâs true, both things are not the case. I have much better and scarierer ways to enter your room. Iâve used a lot of different methods in the past years. Iâve been there hundreds of times. To watch you sleep, without you knowing that I was standing right there, at your sight. Watching your beautiful face when youâre fast asleep. \n\nIâve been chasing you. Iâve been so close plenty of times, without you noticing a single thing. Remember those moments when you were almost run over by a car? Those times when you frightenedly woke up, without knowing what happened? That was me, experimenting with my capabilities. Those were the moments I almost got you. I didnât want you dead then, I was just having fun. A year ago my feelings slowly started to shift. I decided that your time has come.\n\nI have been living up to this night for a long time. Thatâs why I sneaked up so many times into your room, to watch the person whoâs life Iâm going to end someday.\n\nYou might think this is all a yoke. You canât be further from the truth. I can promise you, there will be no tomorrow. Not for you. Youâve been on this earth for too damn long. \n\nSo, what am I?\n\nCall me your Doom. Iâve been chasing and playing with you for years on end. That time is over. Too often have I let you slip through my fingers. Not tonight, tonight I am coming for you, and this time I will get you.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI found this letter an hour ago. Please, please help me. I am too scared to leave the house. I donât know what to do. A minute ago a faint ticking sound started on one of the windows downstairs. Iâm freaking out. I think I'm going to die tonightâ¦",

        "text": "âHold on babe, Iâve just gotta run by the ATM before we pay,â I said. âYou canât just use the card, Jess?â Alexander asked me exasperatedly.  âThe card machine said it was out of order when we walked in,â I told him. âOkay, fine. Iâll be over here looking at these wallets while you go,â he replied. \n\nAs I walked down stairs to the designated area for the ATM machine, I noticed the red glow pulsating slowly. When my feet left the bottom step into the dark grey carpet, I felt like Iâd left the planet all together. The red light clashed with the white tile on the walls and it felt like I was in a hot box. \n\nSurely the lights arenât heatedâ¦ I felt the need to run, go back up into the store and tell Alexander we werenât buying a damn thing today, but he was already stressed with us relocating for his new job. He was being promoted in the firm and needed a few nicer items for his wardrobe. Heâd tell me I was being silly and if I hadnât wanted to come I shouldâve stayed home. \n\nI took a deep breath and started moving forward. I fumbled around in my purse for my wallet. In the muted red light, I managed to find my debit card. \n\nI inserted it with intentions of withdrawing $200. The screen lit up with green letters: \n\nâ&gt; withdrawal?\nâ&gt; deposit?\nâ&gt; check balance?\n\nI pressed the button by withdrawal. \n\nâ&gt; amount? \n\nThe machine questioned as it hummed lightly. I manually put the $200 amount in. I expected it to just give me my money when it did somethingâ¦ peculiar. \n\nâ&gt; What will you give me in return?\n\nâWhat?,â I muttered to myself. I tried to cancel the transaction but this machine just was not giving me my card back. I feel like I pressed every button and it still asked:\n\nâ&gt; What will you give me in return?\n\nI banged my fist against the screen. I felt like I was having a bad dream. This was, needless to say, the weirdest thing Iâd ever experienced, and one of the most upsetting. How could I give this stupid machine anything? Why was it even asking me this? \n\nâWHAT DO YOU WANT?â I shouted. âJust your soul,â said a airy voice. I looked around frantically and saw no one. âFor $200?â I said incredulously. Not that I was going to give whatever the hell this was my soul anyway, but surely it was worth more than $200. âFor any amount of money, or anything else you wantâ it replied.  \n\nâNo. No, I canât do that,â I said. âReally? Are you sure?,â it asked. âYes. Iâd like to keep my soul, thank you,â I told it. âVery well then,â it said, while promptly returning my debit card. I quickly grabbed it with shaky hands and ran as fast as I could back up the stairs. \n\nI nearly plowed Alexander down when I reached the top. âJeez, Jess. Are you alright?,â he asked. âI- I think so,â I told him. I was drenched in sweat so badly my hair was wet. âWhat happened. I was looking at wallets and before I realized it an hour had passed,â he said. âThe ATM is broken. It was so hot down there. I didnât want to come back without money but it wouldnât give me my card back for awhileâ¦,â I trailed off. \n\nâDonât worry, Jess. Iâll get them to hold the clothes and weâll go down to the bank drive through, okay?â he assured me. It seemed like he was a million miles away. I nodded weakly and let him walk me to the car. The cool air outside gave me a chill. \n\nâAre you sure nothing else happened?,â he questioned. âYeah, it was just so hot. I think maybe I got a little dehydrated,â I said with a faint smile. Alexander got the money then ran me through the drive through for a drink. \n\nWhile he went inside to pay for his clothes, I  sat in the car wondering what the hell had just happened to me. Had a ATM really asked me for my soul? Either way I knew I could never tell Alexander. Heâd think I was crazy. He was one of those people that didnât believe anything he didnât see with his own eyes. \n\nItâs been about a year and the thought of my experience still makes me uncomfortable. I donât even like going to that store anymore, and I havenât until just recently. What was strange when I went in is that there wasnât even a stairwell there, no signs that there was an ATM, and that none of the staff even knew what I was talking about when I asked what happened to the ATM room downstairs. \n\nAfter that day, I became very confused. Iâd definitely not imagined what I went through, but now even on the ride home when asking Alexander he seems confused. \n\nâSo you donât remember me going to the ATM that day at all?,â I questioned. âI remember us realizing the card machine was broken, going to the bank, then going by Sonic and getting you a cherry limeade slush, and thatâs all,â he replied. âThatâs not what I remember,â I said feebly. âYou werenât really feeling well that day, Jess, remember? Maybe thatâs all it was,â he said. âMaybeâ¦â I grumbled. Ultimately I decided to let it go. \n\nI couldnât convince anyone else that something happened, but I KNEW that it did. I would often dream of descending the stairs towards that repressed, red glow. Iâd hear that airy voice asking over and over, âWhat will you give me in return?â Then Iâd awake soaking wet with sweat, just like the day I escaped The Devilâs ATM. I learned later thatâs what I encountered.  \n\nA few more years passed and I stopped thinking about my experience with the ATM so much. The dreams even lessened. Alexander and I got married, and then on my twenty seventh birthday I found out I was pregnant with our first child. We were ecstatic. \n\nAlexander had been making enough money for me not to work for years, but Iâd enjoyed my job as a librarian so I continued working there. âWhen the baby comes, you could stay home if you wanted. I know you love your job, and of course itâs totally up to you, but itâs just an idea,â he told me one night over dinner. âI think Iâd like that,â I replied with a soft smile. \n\nMonths went by and we found out weâd have a little girl.  She would be Lila Claire Rollins, and we started getting everything ready for her arrival. Everything was going so wellâ¦ until it wasnât. \n\nI was due for my six month checkup and had to take myself that day, which was no big deal. Alexander hadnât been able to come due to this meeting with international clients that couldnât be rescheduled. I got home and decided Iâd work on the nursery a bit. Before I realized hours had passed and Alexander shouldâve been home. \n\nI called his phone and got no answer. I called two more times, beginning to worry when finally an unfamiliar voice answered. âHello? Mrs. Rollins?,â he questioned. âYes? Who is this? Why do you have my husbandâs phone?,â I questioned. âThis is Officer Jackson Gladstone. Iâm here at Perry Medical Center with your husband. Mrs. Rollins, Iâm sorry to say this but your husband has been in a serious car accident. Heâs still alive, but heâs critical,â I heard him say. \n\nThe tears began falling from my eyes freely. âIâm on my way,â I managed to choke out. I tried my best to calm myself before getting into the car, but it wasnât much use. This couldnât be happening. He had to make it. I loved him and we were about to have a baby. I couldnât imagine going on without him. \n\nI made it to the hospital and went in to wait. Alexander was in surgery at the moment. It seemed like I sat there for an eternity before the doctor came to talk to me. I was understandably very upset but managed to get âbrain damage,â âcollapsed lungs,â and âventilator,â out of everything he was saying. \n\nâIs he going to be alright?,â I sobbed. âMrs. Rollins Iâm very sorry we did everything we could, but the only thing keeping your husband alive at this point is the machines,â he replied. \n\nI was taken to his room and sat there thinking this couldnât be real. I cried hysterical, deep sobs that wracked my entire body. It was that moment, clear as a bell, I could see the bright green letters in my mind, reading:\n\nâ&gt; Would you like to make a withdrawal? \n\nI wiped my face, then rose from the chair. My feet knew where I needed to go. I went out of the room, down the hall to the last door on the right. âATM,â a sign read above the door. The familiar feeling of trepidation washed over me. \n\nI turned the handle and carefully made my way down the steps. When I reached the bottom it was as exactly like I remembered. The red glow radiating off the white tile, the dark grey carpet, and there sat the ATM in the right hand corner. \n\nI felt Lila begin to kick frantically. Before it had only been little flutters and light kicks. I rubbed my belly, trying to calm her somehow. I felt like I was going to be sick, between the furious kicks and the heat. There was no time for that now, I had to save Alexander. \n\nThis time the machine needed no prompting. The words were there when I reached it. \n\nâ&gt; Would you like to make a withdrawal? \n\n- Yes\n- No\n\nMy hands shook as I pressed Yes. The airy voice whispered, âI knew youâd come back. They always do.â âI- I need to save my husband,â I told it. âWhy? Because youâre with child?,â it asked. This irritated me deeply for some reason. âBecause I love him and sure, maybe I want him to live to see and be here for his child,â I replied. âIs he worth your soul?,â it asked. \n\nâI guessâ¦ thatâs why Iâm here. Wherever this is,â I said feebly. âThis is The Devilâs ATM. Heâs acquired many souls with this machine,â it replied. I didnât know how to reply to that, so I stood waiting. âI could take something else,â it finally said. âLike what?,â I asked it. âPerhaps your husband doesnât need a soul,â it said. âI think he does. He shouldnât suffer for my choice,â I told it. \n\nâHmm. I figured as much. There is one more option but Iâm not allowed to tell you the terms. What I can tell you, is that it is the one my master most would like you to take. You take the third deal and your husband will be healed to full health,â the voice told me. âAnd how can I accept that?,â I asked. âJust know you and your husband both will keep your souls, no one has to die for this deal, and no harm will be done to either of you,â it replied. I contemplated what could possibly go wrong here. So many things I was sure, but I was desperate and honestly still wanted to keep my soul. \n\nâOkay, Iâll take the third deal,â I told it. âMy master is most pleased, Jessica Rollins. Please place your hand on the screen,â it said. As I put my hand on the screen something reached out of it, grabbed me by the wrist and promptly cut the palm of my hand. âOuch!â I screamed. âThe deal is complete,â it told me as the screen faded to black. \n\nNext thing I knew I was waking up next to my husbandâs hospital bed. âWhat theâ¦â I trailed off. Had I dreamt it all? The scar I noticed across the palm of my hand confirmed that I had not. Within the next twenty four hours, Alexander began to heal. \n\nThe doctors were confounded. They said there was no possible way he couldâve come back from the injuries he sustained and yet here he was. He was a living miracle. No one knew what Iâd done, and I intended to keep it that way. \n\nWithin two weeks I was taking Alexander home from the hospital. Doctors were still baffled, but what they didnât know wouldnât hurt them. Alexander took two more weeks off before returning back to work, and life went on like normal. \n\nOn the night of September thirtieth, I went into labor. Alexander drove us to the hospital and labor went surprisingly fast for Lila being my first. Itâs when I pushed the final push that I realized what was taken. \n\nThey placed Lila on my chest. She didnât cry, or even whimper. She only looked at me with her dark, cold eyes. My own child terrified me. I wanted to scream, to push her away from me. Instead I did my best to put my arms around my newborn daughter. My daughter, who had no soul.",
