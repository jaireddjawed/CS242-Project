Note, I'm not talking about IT/corporate security or any type of incident response teams. I'll summarize my current thoughts about both types of roles below (I only have experience with appsec teams), please let me know your thoughts as well.\n\nI want my job to consist of auditing code and finding bugs. The benefits I can see for a consulting role would be a lot of variety to the types of code I get to review. This would also allow me to learn about different types of vulnerabilities and improve my bug hunting skills. The downsides I see would be that these will be reviews for random companies, and you don't have much insight into how they're going to use them. They may never patch the bugs you find, or they may patch them incorrectly. Overall, you're fairly detached from the company/product/code. You also have to write formal reports, which I hear is annoying. I hear you don't have that much choice over what projects you take, you're assigned stuff based on your skill set (don't know how that varies between companies).\n\nThe benefits I see of joining an application security team is having an emotional investment in the company and its products, which adds more motivation to reviewing it and making it secure. You may also have more flexibility in choosing what you can review here, focusing on products that you like working on. The downsides I see would be getting bored of looking at the same set of products, and being constrained to certain sets of technologies (i.e. if your company mainly has web products that use a specific set of frameworks, you'll never learn about vulnerabilities with other frameworks, or you're never get better at reviewing android/iOS code if your company doesn't have any apps).\n\nOne more minor upside of appsec teams, is that for large silicon valley companies like the ones I've listed above, salary and benefits are really nice. Although I hear that comes with a lot more pressure/stress than with a consulting role.\n\nThat was a summary of my thoughts on consulting vs. joining a companies appsec team. I'd really like to hear from people in the industry that have tried both, and about any pros and cons I haven't considered. ",

They are aimed at protecting privacy, and they are open source, so their source code can be audited.  So far, so good.\nMy issue is that they do require a lot of sensitive permissions in Android: read contacts, storage, calendar, etc.  And of course, they would actually see all my personal communications.\n\nI am unclear how the source code in GitHub ends up as a compiled application in Google Play, and whether I can trust that it hasn't been tampered with / it is actually the same thing in a different form.  For instance, does it use my contacts locally in the app only, or does it upload the whole lot to servers somewhere?  Does it actually encrypt my messages as it says, or does it send a clear-text copy elsewhere?  Does it store a few things on my device, or does it uses that permission to read all the content of my Android device storage to upload it somewhere?

DPAPI uses a standard cryptographic process called Password-Based Key Derivation to generate a key from the password.\n\n&gt; This password-derived key is then used with Triple-DES to encrypt the MasterKey, which is finally stored in the user's profile directory.\n\n&gt; The MasterKey, however, is not used explicitly to protect the data. Instead, a symmetric session key is generated based on the MasterKey, some random data, and any additional entropy, if an application chooses to supply it. It is this session key that is used to protect the data. The session key is never stored. Instead, DPAPI stores the random data it used to generate the key.\n\nThe API seems very secure in protecting user's passwords then why tools like keepass are able to decrypt them without having administrative access.",

        "text": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work for a firm that has a highly advanced information security group. Both Red Team and Blue Team use modern commercial tools like Cobalt Strike and Defender ATP as well as proprietary methods.  I will be working with one of the groups beginning this summer to help develop proprietary tools, but I'm not sure which yet.  If I'm working with the Red Team, my guess is we'll be developing a set of tools to use when even Cobalt Strike is getting repeatedly detected by the Blue Team: likely malware + c2 + post-exploitation tools or possibly anti-deception and sandboxing code. If I'm working with the Blue Team I think we'll be working on custom deception tooling.  I'm looking to learn as much as I can about existing Red Team attack tools and stealth methods before starting collaboration.   \n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm a software developer and leader with experience in higher level programming and architecture.  My primary area of expertise is large scale enterprise web applications.  I was a security analyst for a while and did some white hat work that was focused on web application and API security with a few pentests thrown in.  Little of the latter experience seems to apply to the tools we now use, and my knowledge of exploitation and network penetration methods are out of date at this point.  What I've learned of the c2 side of things is easy to understand, but I'm interested in learning as much as I can about malware payloads and attack methods.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;One area I'm particularly interested in how teams get their first external foothold via phishing or other methods and then how or if it's good opsec to install a large malicious payload.  I've heard the discussion of stageless payloads being a lot more important now.  There's some fuzziness for me between what gets embedded in the phishing document and the entire malware footprint eventually running in memory with all the tools needed to talk to the c2 and exfiltrate data or perform other actions. \n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I'm working with some of our team personnel on this, but I'm interested in other external answers to my questions too.\n\n\n\n* Are there any resources that can give me a ground up understanding of the current state of Red Team pentesting exploitation tools used against corporate Windows 10 and Mac OS environments? \n* It looks like phishing with DDE is dead on modern environments but DotNetToJScript Macros are still workable?  Are there other more common still working techniques?\n* Should I be learning lower level programming languages immediately?  C++ is about as low level as I've seen in a while.  I see malware executable code generated in higher level languages and exported as DLLs to be reflectively loaded.  Is this common practice?\n\n\n\nThanks so much for any help\n",

I do however have 1.5 years in IT as helpdesk and currently as network admin/systems consultant dealing with everything on the spectrum. I'm also working on a cybersecurity masters if that means anything. I always feel a little insecure about myself and my qualifications when applying to jobs so the main question is do you think it's worth getting a CEH first and then studying for the OSCP? \n\n\nAlso.. if anyone is hiring in the DMV area for security roles... please let me know!",

This javascript was making that http call and sending over the form info. \n\nI quickly flushed my entire CDN cache, re-digested all my assets, and recached everything, and the site is currently fine. I have a few questions:\n\n1. I have no idea HOW they did it. The non-cached version on my server with the same digest does not have the injected code. i am assuming they could use whatever exploit they did to do it again.\n2. How do i report this? i unfortunately don't have any screenshots or the code they injected because i was too busy trying to fix the problem to properly document anything. All i have is the base64 URL that's not stripped of any sensitive data). Obviously google-contents.com is owned by the person doing this, and needs to get shut down. But i have very little proof. \n\nBackground info:\nMy site is running apache, passenger, ruby on rails 5.1.4\nI use amazon cloudfront as my CDN\n\nThis is a little out of my league. Any help or guidance would be appreciated. If this is not the right subreddit, please point me towards one that makes more sense. I have already contacted all customers that ordered within the time frame of the asset being hijacked that could have been affected. ",

Secure, right?  \n  \nI think it's not enough, especially for people who reuse passwords between sites (though I know, terrible practice, but still widespread).\nThis is why I got an idea: [fake 2FA](https://i.imgur.com/STMfWyu.png) !  \nIf you input the wrong password, it brings you to a 2FA screen that cannot be completed, but is indistinguishable from a real one, so hackers cannot know if they actually have the right password.  \n  \nNow, I haven't put much thought into it, but it seems more secure at a glance, and I haven't seen it in practice anywhere, so does it have problems behind it is my question?\n\nPS: the \"FAQ\" link in the sidebar is broken\n\nEDIT: as top answer and other comments show, this isnt that great of an idea for the user, and the better idea is asking for both on the same page and not letting know which one was wrong. thanks for the answers!",

There's no reason to not trust it, but there's no reason to trust it either. The other closed source alternatives have exactly the same trust issue.\n\nOTOH, Padlock is an open source Android app, however it has a relatively small userbase and even though it's open source, I'm certainly not qualified to determine if it contains any dangerous security flaws.\n\nDoes anybody know if there are any open source Android password managers that have undergone any reasonable level of scrutiny?\n\nThe only features I *really* need are:\n\n* Runs on Android\n* Keeps my data safe while it's on the phone or backed up\n* Syncs with a service I trust, like Google Drive or even better my server via SCP/SFTP.\n\nAnybody have any suggestions?",

No formal IT work in the past, but I do have supervisor experience.  \n\nCompany A: Working in Florida, SOC Analyst, Big soulless tech company that bends to clients wants, pushy and slow HR, team lead and supervisor seem fine to work with. Initial offer not perfect, need to negotiate relo package for sign on bonus. Would be a job to work for a couple years for experience and move on to another company in a more ideal locations\n\nCompany B: In Iowa(even worse than Florida, and I was iffy on Florida to start with) comparable benefits, was already willing to offer sign on bonus. Though they are a big bank, their values seem to align with mine, very community oriented, progressive paid leave for new fathers, urges community volunteer work and even pays for 8 hrs a year of it. The job itself is a lot more important, one of the first 3 security employees, I'd report directly to CSO, i would be creating company policies and doing vendor reviews. Seems like a big task for an entry level position. But something that I could enjoy more than just SOC work.\n\nThis would be my first IT job. My thoughts are this, I'd like job in Iowa more, but I think I would hate it because it's in Iowa. I know this company would be one I'd be with for a long time too. The florida job would for the time being as there is more art and culture in the city I'd be moving too, but I feel like Im selling my soul to accept this job. ",

        "text": "Long story short: I work for an arcade company that uses off-the-shelf PCs and a USB dongle for securing our games from copying. Our higher-ups found out that our games were being counterfeited in China and our USB security dongles were essentially useless.\n\nI had suggested hard drive encryption as one security option that can prevent access to the hard drive so hackers wouldn't be able modify the game's executable from running. But after doing more research, I'm at a loss of whether or not this is a good idea or if it's even effective.\n\nThere are two big issues that works against making these machines secure. First, I understand that if a hacker has physical access to the machine, then security will be broken. Unfortunately, since we're selling these machines to buyers, they can easily get access.\n\nSecond, these machines need to have the ability to boot and run the game unattended. This essentially means the hard drive is unlocked from the start, and I can't help but feel that this makes hard drive encryption moot for our case scenario. Otherwise a passphrase is usually required to be entered, which can't be done in our case. I've decided against using USB keys, since there's no point if it has to be connected to the machine all the time in order for the unattended boot to work.\n\nI've looked into storing and sealing the keys with a TPM on the PCs. While I've gotten it working, the other concern is our clients being able to maintain the machines themselves. Our studio prided ourselves in making our machines easy to maintain since we simply use PCs.  But if any hardware changes due to a malfunction or if the data got corrupted and requires a reinstall, then the key stored on the TPM will no longer be usable. The operator will then have to send the whole machine back to us instead of doing simple PC repairs.\n\nMy boss and the higher-ups think that this sacrifice is okay. But I'd rather not have to go through this entire process if hard drive encryption can be made useless with the issues I've mentioned above. \n\nWhile I understand this isn't strictly network security, I'm hoping there are still enough overlap that others can find this useful or interesting.
