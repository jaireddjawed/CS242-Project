        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/104v8wf/genetics_whats_the_relationship_between_dominance/",
        "text": "\"In genetics, **dominance** is the phenomenon of one variant (allele) of a gene on a chromosome masking or overriding the effect of a different variant of the same gene on the other copy of the chromosome. The first variant is termed dominant and the second recessive. (...)  If an individual has two versions of a gene, then the gene that is frequently observed in further generations is considered \"dominant\".\"\n\nSo an *AA* and *Aa* individual exhibit the same *A* phenotype, because the *A* allele is dominant over the *a* allele. Only *aa* individuals exhibit the different *a* phenotype. That works well when 100% percent of *AA* and *Aa* individuals show the *A* phenotype, but that's not always the case.\n\n\"**Penetrance** in genetics is the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant (or allele) of a gene (the genotype) that also express an associated trait (the phenotype).\"\n\nThat means that sometimes an individual with the *A* gene (either *AA* or *Aa*) can have the *a* phenotype*.* Maybe 99% of those individuals have the *A* phenotype as expected, maybe 90%, maybe 75%.\n\nMy question is: when does that allele simply stop being dominant? If an *Aa* individual can have both the *A* or *a* phenotype, does it make sense to call *A* dominant over *a*? It must be above 50%, but when?\n\nAlso, does anyone have any suggested materials for me to read on penetrance?\n\nThanks!",

If it's organized by location and how often they produce research, that would be optimal. I guess the main hurdles for me are location, so I can help out more and be able to go regularly, and secondly just finding the right person. Another issue has been experience. Alot of the research programs available ask for prior research experience, several letters of recommendation, etc. I'm new to actual research, so I have no prior research. Although I have worked with patients in a volunteer setting, and have taken a couple classes with lab work.\n\nIf you are a PI, or know someone who would be interested in taking on assistant, let me know. But otherwise a list/database would be very helpful. Thanks!",

        "text": "I'm a bioengineering PhD student and I got curious about how many  probiotics are actually present in yogurt. Probiotic pills will normally  claim to have like 3 billion cfu per pill, but yogurt can (based on my  research) have &gt;5 billion cfu per GRAM. One bite of yogurt likely has  an order of magnitude more probiotics than any probiotic pill. But I  wanted to know how many organisms are in commercial yogurt.  \n\nSo I had to try for myself:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/93s\\_DebUawk](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/93s_DebUawk)\n\nA bit of a source to back me up: [https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-probiotics](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/how-to-get-more-probiotics)\n\nOikos seems to have the most at &gt;10 billion cfu per gram. At least out of the ones I tested.\n\nHave any others out there also looked into this topic? I'd love to hear your thoughts and any additional information you may have.",
