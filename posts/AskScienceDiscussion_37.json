        "text": "Okay, so I've always been super interested in the concept of spacetime, and just time in general. I'm doing some stuff right now for some fantasy writing, and it got me curious about something. \n\nNow, I'll preface this by saying I could very well have a complete misunderstanding of potential energy within my question. If that is the case, I would ask that the people who answer the question correct the term to whatever it should be. \n\nSo, the question is in the title, but I'll elaborate here. If we are to say that the passage of time generates energy (this energy is what I refer to as potential energy. If that would not fall under the umbrella of potential energy, please enlighten me in your response!), what would that mean for the universe and our understanding of it? Would it explain certain things we're looking to know? Would it rewrite our fundamental understandings of the foundation of our learnings? Or would it simply add onto what we already know, without detracting from what we already know. \n\nI know I asked what the value is, but I seriously doubt that you would be able to provide a value given that it would seem there's no actual current way to measure such a thing. That being said, if we were to suppose it does generate energy, would anything we already know point to it being a large amount, a minute amount (pun intended), etc. \n\nI understand that the way we currently measure time is relative to us, and doesn't apply to the universe really at all as a whole. One day on Earth is much different from a day on Venus, or a day on Jupiter, and that's just in our solar system! \n\nI'm kind of rambling at this point, but anything anyone has to say on the matter would be something I would definitely like to hear. \n\nTo finish this off, I understand that what I'm saying very could not make sense, so it might be a far-reaching hypothetical, but I hope someone can give it the light of day. :)",

The most intense hurricane ever recorded was [Typhoon Tip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Tip), which had a pressure of 870 mbar and a diameter of 2220 km at its strongest. The asteroid collides with the storm's eye as it passes over the Western Pacific. It's the [Chixulub impactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor), hitting the Earth with the same velocity and angle as it did 66 million years ago.\n\nWhat happens to the hurricane?

If a significant percent of the population is culled, the species will rapidly rebound, possibly (for a short term) to a population higher than the original.\n\nAgreed.

        "text": "[I read this incredible article about neurology recently](https://www.quantamagazine.org/brains-may-teeter-near-their-tipping-point-20180614/) and wonder if the dynamic phases neurons can organize into, can ever really claim one structure is not inclusive. After all canâ€™t plasticity permit new self organization with enough training?\n\nThey argue homeostatic plasticity is discernible from quasi-criticality. And yet modality would not eliminate either of them. Though locality and functionalism might have one be more dominate given specific parameters.\n\nWhat is noise is structurally conditional. We already know hexagonal grid pattern forms spontaneously, which use a inhibition-based attractor. This supports homeostatic plasticity. Yet you have to wonder if this self organization is not the expression of known modes. Too much synchronicity does lead to seizures. Too little may not self differentiate from the background, which we also know, agency can bootstrap. Is wu-wei a conscious process? Is energetic deloading an attempt to lock in a configuration space? And yet some pentagonal tiling is non-periodic, a pattern that is not procedural, could be indespicable in the event of a deadlock.\n\nHow would intelligent agency disseminate decentralized processes to address a multiplicity of functions? We like to think of generalized intelligence as adaptable, not just a savant specialized intelligence. And so asynchronous is the obvious choice, both for parallelization of tasks, but also drive some determinism. And to best sustain the asynchronous, might just need power-laws to lock-in to a modality. Power-laws that clearly follow focal acquisition using phenomena like Weberâ€™s law. \n\nAgency itself is a kind of cope out of multiple realizability. Trying to get out of a semantic account, but still get to the wetware. Humaculous too far, but democracy so necessary, even down to the self regulation of gene expression to share resources. Afterall our capillaries are the same as mice. Its the need to share, that slows the metabolic process, that changes the same encoding. It seems even environment is used intrinsically in more than one way.\n\nAnd so the question comes to the operational account of the fruit in the fruit salad. What list of ingredients best answer this multiple realizability, but does not lead to massive modularity? If brain cells are to get fruity, there may not be one dining philosopher pleased, but many. Agents feast even when being servers like astrocytes. Quasi-knowledge, so dangerous, but hard epistemological ontologies as death. It seems the encoding scheme of nature flirts with efficiency. But zero sums still constrain swarms.\n\nSo I argue, without a context of function, neither of their hypothesisâ€™s are falsifiable. They are both likely phases. Why not both? Especially if the brain changes through development. Modality could not eliminate them and how hard of an configuration space that solves a problem is conditional on the task. Without a prior of function, brain age, and algorithm picked, I am of the opinion their approach is flawed. Both generalizations might have a locality that better utilized the recombinatorial tribe that dominates it (Bayesian, analogizer, genetic algorithms, symbolism, connectionalism). Or they might both represent how boundaries are established, but might fundamentally be stochastic in its choosing. Plasticity is not a one operational kind of action. It is an overgenerilization that tries to assign associativity to non-linear processes.",

What would happen if I were to take a really big knife and cut off a piece of Earth? Like, let's say a chunk roughly one eighth of earth's total mass. I have a lot of sub questions.\n\n-What would happen to the atmosphere? Would it close around the lost part? Would it drain out into space? What about the atmosphere of the chunk that gets sliced off? Would it hang on?\n\n-Could the chunk that gets cut off stay close to Earth? Like could the planet's gravity hold the severed piece within a few hundred miles? Does that depend on how exactly it gets cut off?\n\n-How would this affect the way Earth orbits the sun? Would the change throw the planet off its orbit? What if the severed piece manages to stay close to the planet, like what I ask about in the previous bullet?\n\n-What would the immediate and long term effects be for both the planet and the slice? If they managed to stay close together through gravity, almost like a second moon, could life continue on either part? I'm sure there'd be big changes, but do you think it's theoretically possible?\n\nI don't know enough about gravity/biology/everything involved in this to give myself a satisfying answer, so I'm hoping you all have some insight and that this is the right place to ask. Thanks!\n\n\nEdit: I appreciate the input so far, it's been really interesting to read. Thanks everyone!",
