        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm looking for some advice/thoughts/opinions. About 3 weeks ago I was in a very bad car accident, hit head on by someone going 50+ mph on their cellphone. Surprisingly enough I walked away with minimal injuries and with the way it all played out I swear someone or something was really guarding me. I mean my car was dangling on the edge of a riverbank and to be completely honest if I would of went in, I would not be here today. A few hours after I got home that day I was letting my dog out and noticed a black shadow figure behind my fence. It made me feel physically ill when I saw it but I did my best to not give it attention &amp; to ignore it but everyday since it has made its presence known to me and has made its way inside of my home. I was cooking dinner the other day and out of no where my cabinet flew open and all of my plates literally flew off the shelf, I've had a few instances of my feet being tugged/touched while I'm sleeping, the feeling of something hovering right over me staring as I sleep, my closet doors flying open, knocks on my door when no one is there, whispering, along with the most insane dreams. I tried to chalk it up to trauma at first and telling myself I was crazy, but honestly things keep progressing and to me it's very clear there's some sort of presence that's attached to me. Did my guardian angel piss something off when I survived my accident? Any tips on how to get rid of whatever it is?",

        "text": "thought I'd write out a creepy experience I had while working on a farm in a remote part of southern Trinidad, right on the coast, with Venezuela's Amazon rainfores across the water.\n\nOne night some neighbours were hanging out in our common room, chatting about anything and everything. The topic of the paranormal came up, and one man said that a couple nights ago, he had seen a large orange fireball rise out of the ground of the local cricket pitch, and fly away in the sky. \"Wow!\" I said. \"Sounds like you saw a UFO\" (I'm Canadian, and didn't know about the local folklore).\n\n\"That was no UFO\", he said, \"that was a sokounya\".\n\n\"What's that?\" I asked. He proceeded to explain what this creature was, and everyone else in the room solemnly agreed. It was some of the most far-fetched stuff I'd ever heard but the atmosphere was dead serious. He told me that a sokounya is a witch, an old crone who lives in the jungle or the outskirts of towns. These women have created a pact with a dark entity that allows them very prolonged lifespans. The way they maintain their lives for so many years is vampirism; they enter people's homes at night, invisible, and suck their blood. They shed their skin and become a fireball, and fly around. They can enter people's homes through a space as small as a keyhole. The only way to kill them is by tracking down the location that the old woman left her skin during the night, and throwing salt on her skin.\n\nAs you can imagine, this was pretty damn trippy to hear. It gave me the creeps, especially because multiple people in the room told their own very personal experiences with the witch, including one guy whose wife had her blood sucked *while in bed with him.* Apparently she woke up pale and blue, and she had human-sized bite marks all over her body. It took weeks for her to regain her strength.\n\nFreaky. Here's where it gets freakier.\n\nA couple nights later, I was sleeping in my cinderblock bedroom. I'm dreaming, and all of a sudden my dream becomes very sharp, very focused and very real. I see my own body sleeping. I look up through the ceiling and see above the house a fireball has just flown in. I sense a terrifying power from this fireball and I feel this witch looking at me, wondering whether to strike. I try to wake myself up desperately as this fireball contemplates whether to enter the house and suck my blood ... she wants me. Just as she's about to fly in, her attention shifts violently to the corner of my room. She focuses on a small black-and-white stone egg that my mother gave me for good luck while travelling. That egg breaks her thirst for me and she flies away. The second she takes her attention off my room, I wake up screaming in a cold sweat. In other words, the stone egg protected me. It's a wild story, and maybe it was all in my head, but it felt incredibly real. Hope you enjoyed.",

She was to take her dog name Gizzy, really a mutt, wiry hair, no structure, would not even go outside and pee.\n\nWhen we brought her home, my 3rd son took her, said he would clean up after her, feed her, walk her, you know all the things a kid will say, but never do.  My wife and I did buy a cage, because she would not pee or poop where she slept, we set her up water and food inside the cage, and it was not a box, it was literally a cage, wire mesh.  Put her up at night out in the morning, walk around, go outside with the other pups and eat and drink, then when we left or when we went to bed, it went back to the cage.  It had a doggy bed, and some towels, kinda cushy comfort.\n\nThis last for about three months, and my son was getting really attached to the pup, so I told my little sis that if she wanted Gizzy then she better take him NOW, cause I was done with the back and forth, yes I will take her, no I do not want to, you know how it is.  At the 3 month mark, I told my son that she was his, permanently, not going to his aunts, it's done, she is ours.  He was elated, and I was happy to see him happy, and the poor thing needed a home, win win, well almost.\n\nI was working 3 on 4 off and 4 on 3 off, 12 hour shifts, so I was up at odd times and my wife would fall asleep in the living room sometimes way before I was ready to go to bed, and I would shut down the house then get her to go to bed when I was ready.  One night, I had shut down everything except the receiver.  We have 5.1 Dolby that the old receiver had died long ago, so we were using a little Panasonic that we had gotten at Fry's.  Well everything was shut down except that receiver and a light, when over the speakers i heard really fast, \"Thank you for\" and then slower \"taking care of\" and very clearly \"Gizzy for me.\"\n\nI just was dumb founded. What the hell just happened?  I tried to recreate it, went checked the receiver, and it would not come on.  I tried unplugging it, checked the fuse, reconnecting the wires, nothing from that day forward the speaker would not work, but it's last message sent chills up and down my spine, and this is **one** of the reasons I know there is life after death.",

I do believe people have these strange experiences every day, some more than others, even I‚Äôve been through some weird shit. But I think it‚Äôs super naive to boil it all down to the classic and outdated ghost theory. \n\nA few questions about the ghost theory:\n\n‚Ä¢ Since people believe it‚Äôs spirits of dead humans, does that mean the existence of ghosts ‚Äústarted‚Äù when the first humans died? And how exactly would that work biologically? \n\n‚Ä¢ If this theory has been the general consensus regarding this topic for thousands of years, how come there is no real evidence for it? \n\n‚Ä¢ Why would only some people turn to ghosts, and why would they chose to spend the ‚Äúafterlife‚Äù being alone in a abandoned basement or something? \n\nPersonally I find it more likely that we‚Äôre just simply too stupid to experience all of reality. Just like how a gold fish is confined to its fish bowl not knowing there‚Äôs a whole world, planets, and universe outside of it. Maybe some day we will finally come to some provable conclusions, until then I have no issues saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù.\n\nI know people HATE not having answers, and that‚Äôs probably the real answer to my question here.",

I was a block away from the gas station that was just out of sight, just needed to go through the underpass and I would be there.\nI had to cross the street since the gas station was on the other side at the corner of the block, of course I naturally looked both ways for cars and suddenly I see my mother's car approaching, it seemed weird to me because I had just messaged her about 15 minutes before leaving my house to see where she was at, since she hadn't been home all day. She had told me she was at my grandmother's and would be for a little bit longer.\nAs the car got closer I locked eyes with my mother, and although it was dark I could see in the cars passing by from where I was due to an extremely bright sign on a local bar just a cross the street.\nAs me and my mother locked eyes she drove past and it was a very creepy look, her head turned to face me the further down the road she got, just before the point of looking over her shoulder it seemed, she never broke eye contact until then.\nI immediately called my mother and asked if she just drove past the gas station and she had told me no, she was still at my grandmother's house. I couldn't have gotten off that street any quicker and into the gas station.\nI can only figure it was my mother's doppelganger... It was her, the same hair, same eyes and facial structure. it was her car, same color, model, and even the same scratches and rust on the car.\nI was reading that doppelgangers are a sign of bad news or something? If this is true, would that doppelganger had been warning me of an upcoming, very bad fight between me and her?",

The prospective roommates living there said they've experienced doors closing and one of them said she actually saw a little boy playing with model trains and whatnot. I am not spiritually attuned at all (ie I have never seen ghosts although I believe strongly in them) although they tell me that the spirits are \"not malicious\" and would just be curious about me. Ironically I am a big horror junkie but I feel dealing with spirits irl is something I'd be pretty terrified of... especially since I don't know if the spirits would dislike it if I watched horror movies in that house, or if I had s*x in there... what's the protocol here on how to live with spirits without angering or encountering them? I'm definitely still looking for other places to live but I also have budget restrictions and other criteria for roommates ... in addition to being disinclined to living on my own (my area is pretty unsafe.)

I have never seen anything paranormal in my life, so I was a little nervous and excited to go explore this place. I don't usually go look or attract attention to anything like ghosts or such things, I'm not spiritual either. Unlike my friend, she is more into dark/goth things, and i would say spiritual as well.\n\n   Anyways, it was around midnight that we got to the location and started to go to and across the bridge. I saw nothing unusual, just all the weird writing all over the bridge. After crossing, I told her I didn't want to go too far past the bridge because I was a bit scared, ngl.\nWe had our flashes from our phones out, and I was on the lookout for anything. I knew if I flashed my light out into the distance, I could potentially see something, especially eyes. But I didn't see a single pair of eyes that night. We were also underneath the bridge for a bit quietly listening, but still, I didn't hear anything either.\n\n   It wasn't until we got back to my truck that she told me  she saw eyes all around us in the distance and didn't want to say anything to prevent me from being scared. I was very surprised and got out of there asap, lol.\n\nSo again,can people see things others can not? Just curious",

        "text": "I was sent over here from another sub. And due to some of the responses I got, I want to get ahead of their concerns and state that I've had these incidents from childhood on. I also currently struggle with language usage and memory. I don't always make sense, and if someone notices that, I really can't figure out the issue on my own. This is the result of having too low O2 with COVID. I was under 90 ox sat for a week and incapable of waking up on my own for three weeks. I'm super bitter about it, but do feel free to call me out. I'm not manic, just disabled.\n\nAnyway, I have dreamt or predicted the death of humans and pets (all cats bc it's a cat family I guess) since I was a child. I also had migraines as a child, with full blown vision obfuscation when the aura hit. Possibly related.\n\n1 - Often this takes the form of dreams where the person or cat comes to me and says goodbye in some way. There was one when my childhood cat showed up with the cat the family had when I was an older teenager, and the cat let me pet her until they both left. Her body was found at 9 am the next day. I have also had my grandmother, who lived 2800 miles away so I could not see her health degrade, say goodbye. She just hugged me hard like I used to do. I was the only one in the family as short as her. I woke up sobbing at a sleepover, got on a train, and went home. I got the news when I got in the house.\n\n2 - When I was unconscious with COVID, I was in what looked like highly sedimented water, the kind we got in the summer when I lived in the sticks of NC. The brown from dirt kind. Alternatively, the idea of an amniotic sac was in my head, but I don't think that's what it was. I was under water unable to break the surface no matter how I tried. The cat I loved who had died seven months before, one I was very close to (it's all over my posting history if you want, but tldr she decided to watch over me), sat on the bed watching like she always did. She had this look of contentment when she was alive, and that's the look she had. My dad was also there, who died in 2013, was sitting in my reading chair rocking slowly. Don't remember his expression. I'd get tired and rest with the cat, then try again. \n\nEventually, my father said I had to wake up or it was time to go. I said I still had to be a mom. He was proud of that, but I forget the words he head. He left through a door that had just a lot of light and gold in it. The door disappeared when he stepped through it. The cat stayed and did that weird cat nod thing I don't know the meaning of. I said goodbye to her. It might be relevant that my last words to her were, \"When it's my turn, I'll come find you again.\" Like if there are soulmates (and I believe there are multiple for each person) she is undoubtedly one of mine. But I broke the water, and woke up. I only remember my daughter bursting into sobs and getting someone.\n\nThere's amnesia after that. I think not remembering was a function of COVID, as well. I still have long COVID symptoms. Sucks. I miss running and going to bed after 8pm.\n\n3 - Occasionally, the feeling of something really wrong is coming will hit me. When my brother and best friend were over for \"anime and donut\" night (I miss that), my best friend offered to take my brother home. She lived five minutes away from my parents, and I lived 40 minutes one way. It was obviously most efficient for her to take my brother home, and my car sucks for night driving. But I pushed it and took my brother home. Dad woke up briefly. He looked like shit. He'd gained an enormous amount of weight very quickly, was always tired, wasn't even up for hanging out on his birthday even though the plan was just to chill together. I gave him a hug and said I loved him. I sobbed all the way home. He died three days later. I knew it was coming the day of and was \"off\" all day. When I saw my brother call, I knew. I was horrified to learn he was the one to find him. He was a high school sophomore.\n\nI had another where I had a VERY strong urge to contact an old teacher out of nowhere. I went to a 6-12th grade school AND I failed a grade during it, so I was there eight years. I had one teacher for all eight. It was the backend side of theater. We had a class for learning to do lighting, sound, set design, etc. I loved it. But over the years, he saw abuse in my life and that CPS did nothing. So he subverted it by doing things like signing my yearbook with \"no one is mad at you\" but not in the autographs page should it be looked at. He also would have me do more plays if I was in a bad spot, because it kept me on campus. He knew my manager at work was a creep, and when I was a senior, he threatened the guy I was dating directly (another legal adult) if he hurt me. He did anyway. He'd take my phone when the boyfriend called to be awful and gave it to a random other crew member. It had the effect of highlighting that I did have a community. \n\nHe did a lot for me. He nurtured interests that weren't directly relevant to the class that we made relevant. He even pointed out that when I did my last show, he noticed no boyfriend or relative had ever come to a show except that last one. I ended up marrying that guy. He was right.\n\nSo I wrote a letter explaining all the ways in which his influence changed my life and lead me to being safe, sound, and able to break cycles. I'm told he cried. He wrote an email shortly after saying his labs were improving and he was optimistic. I burst into tears, because there was a deep feeling in me screaming that he would die. He did three weeks later. I am so glad for the feeling. He should get to know he made a massive difference.\n\n4 - On New Year's 2021, I got on the top of a trunk in my bedroom with the song \"Next Year\" by the Mountain Goats playing. I said the year was going to suck (it did and I'm not okay still) and that the cat from 2 would die. I don't know why I said it. It felt like someone else inside me was saying it, and that's not my typical energy. If I'm worried, I'm usually quieter and morose. I hopped down and felt normal again. The cat died of an aneurysm. Something you can't predict will happen through degradation over time. I was told what happened was rare.\n\nThe night she died, I dreamt 12 separate times she put her paw on my right wrist. I felt like she was okay and didn't blame me and loved me. I have that tattooed on me now.\n\n5 - This is the best one imo. Dad died in 2013, and now in Dec. 2022, the flowers we got from the funeral are still alive, but they never bloom. They did once, the day my daughter was born. And only then. The whole fucking family except my brother was out of the country, and so was my husband's. So it was just him. And he knew the baby was on her way when he saw the flowers. Then he checked his phone and how I'd blown it up lol. She was three weeks early. She also dreams about her \"grandpa with a mustache and wet kisses\" since she could talk and before I told her about my dad. And I never mentioned the kisses. But she was right.\n\n6 - On every major occasion, I hear me and Dad's song. Aerosmith's \"I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\" in some capacity. My last OB visit, which wasn't supposed to be the last. When I did my first conference talk for my career at our big convention, I saw someone read it like a poem in a Tik Tok from a Warcraft friend who had no idea about the convention. My wedding day it was on in the car. I only have radio, so there's no way to really avoid stuff coming on. My car super sucks, but the CD player breaking was my fault. I thought a second disc in would force them both out. I was very wrong.\n\nWhen I described these to the other subreddit, not only was I pointed here, a lot of them worried I was delusional, that I needed to see a psych (I already do), that I was manic (I have PTSD, not bipolar disorder). But again these have happened over the entire course of my life including young childhood. I remember seeing the cat lie down back in our old state by my room. I was 3ish. I knew she was gonna die, too. I found out much later how she died, but she did and it was a horrible way to go and I'm glad they put her down rather than ride that out (she ate glass). \n\nBut I'm not delusional. My friends have seen them, and the atheists just tell me not to tell them when I feel something is really wrong because it freaks them out but don't wanna admit it. I've had other experiences, but these are my biggest except for finding a tarot card neatly in my closet that warned of bad things coming, but I can't tell that one because frankly I forgot the card. Someone said ten of swords once but idk. I was afraid of the deck after that and got rid of it.\n\nI've almost died three times this year - COVID was one, anaphylaxis, and a stroke at 34 - and it feels easier to feel things than usual. I see the cat in my dreams sometimes where she's trying to shoo bad dreams away. I write to my dad a lot. I write them down and burn them in something called a worry hut. I like it a lot, but I know that's silly.\n\nAnd I don't know what I want from people here, but maybe an explanation? Or validation? I have no idea. And I don't know how  to end this so ...  end.",

        "text": "I don‚Äôt know if this was necessarily paranormal or a sleep paralysis or whatever but I feel like I have to share incase anyone knows if there is a deeper meaning. \n\nThis happened last night. \n\nFirstly - I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I was laying wide awake scrolling on tiktok when a tarot reading came up and it resonated a lot with me so I began watching a longer version of it. After a while I suddenly felt extremely uneasy so I decided to try to sleep. \n\nThe second the clock hit 3:00AM, a lightning of terror shot throughout my body, from head to toe. It felt like something entered my body and as soon as that ‚Äúthing‚Äù had traveled from my feet, my whole room ‚Äùcreaked‚Äù (in the ‚Äúthe house is settling‚Äù kinda way). It then sounded like small knocks, almost like footsteps in my room. \nAs a way of trying to calm myself down, I once again used my phone and put on some ASMR. \n\nAfter some time passed, the temperature in the room noticeably dropped. I went from sweating to freezing. I then tried to sleep again. \n\nI was laying on my stomach and my thoughts wandered away and the name ‚ÄòAdam‚Äô was spoken over and over, and then, suddenly, it just said ‚ÄúEve‚Äù and once that name entered my mind it felt like someone was pushing my head down towards my pillow, and my body towards the mattress. I felt a pulsating feeling at the back of my head and in the pulses I heard banging of metal being hit on metal over and over and a voice in my said ‚ÄúEve, Eve, Eve. And this, *my name*, is healing‚Äù. I then tried to open my eyes and I couldn‚Äôt move, and I knew it could be sleep paralysis so I tried to wiggle my toes and fingers to snap out of it, but when I did, and started trying to sit up, I was almost jolted back into that ‚Äústate‚Äù of hearing banging and someone pushing me down. Eventually, I got out of it and couldn‚Äôt really sleep anymore because I was so terrified. \n\nThe way I was pushed down felt almost like a magnet pulling me to the ground. I don‚Äôt know what happened. It was probably nothing. It‚Äôs just that a few days ago I dreamt that I was being chased by a demon and ngl I‚Äôm not exited to go to sleep tonight lol. \n\nDoes anyone have any theories on what this could be? Probably just a tired mind lol. Thank you for reading and I‚Äôm sorry for any writing mistakes. English isn‚Äôt my first language. :)",

Idk really what to make of it but I was absolutely terrified and managed to leave without it doing anything to me. I have been attacked before while having these what I call paranormal dreams and there have been other events leading up to this point like my grandma passing away and my brother moving into her house.

I‚Äôve had other dreams about my grandparents land and home that just I can‚Äôt really explain why they‚Äôre happening to me like I‚Äôm being sent a message. Is this evil thing I saw trying to intimidate me? Maybe attack me? Maybe this thing is finally showing itself to me possibly linked to an paranormal experience I had as a child while with my younger sister. My older and my younger sister have actually seen evil looking things while awake in the house. Any idea why this is happening or any advice would be welcome. TIA",

        "text": "I posted recently some stories about the most recent house I'd lived in in the UK, but that house was far from the most haunted house I've lived in. What follows are some recollections and notes of my families first house, a house that eventually, had to be exorcised...  \n\nWell, maybe it was exorcised. That‚Äôs what my stepdad said much later and after the fact, but he‚Äôs always been a liar. What I can safely say is true is that the first house my family lived in was haunted and by something not at all pleasant. First, a little bit of history, we actually moved into the house when I was six months old. It was in the Dingle area of Liverpool, just down from Mill Street. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs still like it there, but, at the time, the streets were filled with red brick terraced houses, which were quite old, already close to a hundred years or so when my family moved in. I lived there from the age of six months until I was six and then we moved to Cornwall for a while, with the family after us being the one‚Äôs to doing the alleged exorcism. \n\nAnyway, according to my mum, the first couple of years were relatively calm and peaceful with nothing out of the ordinary happening. It was when my baby brother was born that things started going strange. I should mention now that all but one of the stories that follow are things I have little or no recollection of, with them being told to me by various people (chiefly my nana and my mum, but also my cousins who would babysit my brother and I) or could be chalked up to being half-awake and dreaming, but the final story is one that I remember quite vividly, and you‚Äôll see why.\n\nSo, as I mentioned, the trouble started when my brother was born. Up until then, I‚Äôd been sleeping in my parent‚Äôs room in a cot. There was a spare room next to it that we‚Äôd been using for storage, but since my parent‚Äôs room was small, and they wanted to have the new-born in there with them, it was decided that they‚Äôd move me into the next room and so they sorted it all out, spent a heap of money the family didn‚Äôt have to get it redecorated, got a big bed set up in there, moved all my toys in, and so on. Then I refused to move into the bedroom. My mum said I‚Äôd been really eager, at first, but that first night in there, I‚Äôd ran back into their room and under their covers, screaming and bawling that I wouldn‚Äôt sleep in there. Whatever, right? It‚Äôs just a kid who‚Äôs anxious to spend their first night alone, it happens. The second night, the same thing. The third night, the fourth night. Same. My stepdad argues with my mum, calling her a soft-touch for letting me sleep in the same bed as them night after night, and so he storms off to my bedroom to have a bed all to himself. A few hours later, he wakes me, my mum and my brother up by running back into my parent‚Äôs bedroom and slamming the door. He tells my mum that it‚Äôd be best if we all slept in the same bedroom from then on. And we pretty much did. We tried a few times after that to move me, and then me and my brother, into that room, but it simply didn‚Äôt take. I remember that, in the daytime, the room was very pleasant. I‚Äôd sit in there and play with my toys, my race cars and what not of which I had a huge collection, but, before the sun would go down, I‚Äôd be out of there.\n\nThere are two more stories about the bedroom, the first is one from when my cousin was babysitting my brother and I. She was watching TV with the two of us, when something made a loud crash upstairs. We all went upstairs, my cousin carrying my brother in her arms, and we opened the door to the bedroom. Inside, all of my toy cars were scattered on the floor, with the plastic box they had been in lying on top of them. This box had been on the floor. It was too heavy for a kid to lift, so it had been on the floor. Something had upended it completely. As always, it being the night, the room was cold and dark. My cousin slammed the door, grabbed my hand and rushed us downstairs. People didn‚Äôt have cell phones in those days, so my cousin rang her mum and begged her to come as quickly as possible, which she did. (Odd little sidenote to this, her mum, my aunt, is quite into all that new-age stuff, crystals, chakras and the rest of it, but she never did believe my cousin‚Äôs story even though she‚Äôd hurried to the house, anyway‚Ä¶)\n\nThe last story about the bedroom is one that I remember, but I‚Äôm not sure if it was a dream or not. It was another attempt to get me, and this time my brother also (he was about four by then), to sleep in the bedroom. My stepdad decided that he‚Äôd stay in there too, thinking that maybe whatever entity was there wouldn‚Äôt show up if there were three of us there or something. That night, something woke me up, I‚Äôm not sure what it was, but as my eyes grew accustomed to the orange light that was coming in from the street outside, I saw something on top of the wardrobe. It was a shadow in the outline of a man. He was sat on the edge of the wardrobe, kicking his feet back and forth, his head tilted down as if he had been watching me, my brother and my stepdad sleep. I screamed and kicked my stepdad who woke up, and he screamed when he looked at what I was screaming out. He dove out of bed and hit the light and the shadow-man/thing/whatever it was, just faded away into nothingness. That was the last time any of us stayed in that room at night.\n\nNow, a palate cleanser. One night, my nana was babysitting my brother and I (and this time, also our sister, who was only a few months old at the time). My nana loved to watch Westerns. So, she‚Äôs got us all sat around her whilst this movie is on, only for the TV to suddenly switch channels. Now, instead of the Western, there‚Äôs this extremely raunchy show, basically softcore porn, on the TV. This was an old TV, there were no remote controls. To change the channel, you had to get up and press the buttons yourself. So, she gasps, springs to her feet, and quickly turns the TV back to her Western. Just as she sits back down, the TV, again, switches back to the raunchy show. This repeats a few more times, before my nana yells out, ‚ÄúDo that again and I‚Äôll come up there and sort you out!‚Äù and when she puts the Western back on, it stays on. \n\nThe last story I have to tell you today is the reason why we ended up moving out of the house and it is my strongest memory of the place. I mentioned at the start of this whole thing that my house was in the Dingle area of Liverpool, which is not a nice area. There are worse areas, and it‚Äôs gotten a lot worse since I moved away from there, but it is not a nice area. As a result of this, the house had a giant deadbolt lock on the front door. This lock was clunky as anything and sounded somewhat like a bank vault when it opened. So, one night, me, my brother, my sister and my mother, are watching TV when we hear something rattling the lock. We were expecting my stepdad to be home at that time, so my mum grins and bundles us into the closet by the kitchen. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll wait for him to come in, jump out and surprise him!‚Äù We get in the closet just as the door opens and someone steps into the house. Slow, heavy, footsteps enter the living room, walk past the closet, and into the kitchen. My mum pushes the closet door open quietly, then the kitchen door and we all yell ‚ÄúGOT YOU!‚Äù Only, no one is there. There was a back door to the kitchen, but it was locked with a deadlock, and we hadn‚Äôt hear anyone use it and, in any case, they wouldn‚Äôt have had the time to slip through it. Then, the kitchen exploded. The cupboards opened and things flew out of them, the plates jumped from the shelves, the fridge voided itself of its contents. It was like a silent hurricane was whipping itself around the kitchen. My mum didn‚Äôt say anything, she just grabbed us, put the baby in the pram, and basically ran us all the way to my nana‚Äôs house. The next day, during the day, she went back with my stepdad to get our things, and we never went back to that house.\n\nThere are other stories about the house, with most of them being fairly generic, things going missing, inexplicable cold spots, and my cousin said she once saw an old man peering at her from outside the window (the Dingle was not a nice place, I must repeat, so that one, sadly, might not be anything inexplicable). There is one other story I have about that place‚Ä¶. but that story stretches far beyond the story of this house, and (it is my belief, from the research I‚Äôve done) is actually something of a family curse (with accompanying malevolent entity). Anyway, on that note, I bring this one to a close. Good night!",

It was in the afternoon, it was about 3 or 4pm, and I was alone in my room I heard multiple, ort of whisper-shout into my ear; it was like screaming but breathy. it was discordant and I didn't know where the sound was coming from. There were others at home, but they were all sleeping but one person, who didn't hear anything. This sound was only in my left ear.\n\nThe next day my ear hurt, and it felt like I had an infection, though the pain and discomfort stopped the following day.\n\nThe second time I heard something was a couple of weeks later, again in the afternoon, and this time I was in a room with like 20+ people. I was having a conversation when I heard unintelligible whispering again in my left ear, though no one else around me did. I then had pangs of pain in my ear for the rest of the day and for some of the next day after that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust now I heard a child's voice in my ear, I couldn't catch what was said but it wasn't whispered lol it would definitely had been intelligible if I was focusing. It's about 9 30pm right now and I'm not alone. I heard it in my left ear also.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould any of you be able to tell me what is happening and what I can do about it? I'm also not sure if maybe the whole thing is a figment of my imagination lol.",

So we used to have a really creaky old garage door that you could hear through the house when it opened. I was looking for something in my mom‚Äôs bathroom when I heard it open‚Äîand I thought it was my mom, and I knew she had gone to the store so I got up and went to see if she needed help. \n\nThe corgi we had at the time had beat me to the door that leads out to the garage like normal, and I opened the door only to find the garage empty and the door shut. I was all ‚Äúweird‚Äù and for some reason touched the control panel on the wall‚Äîit always heated up whenever the garage door was opened or closed, and stayed like that for a few minutes.

At the charge, my mom was on the phone, however when I looked up I noticed an older hunchback disheveled women looking at us. Keep in mind the car is tinted and it is night time and there are other cars around us also with people in it. Anyway, I took note of this. Fast forward a few minutes she is still there and I'm beginning to get afraid. I tell my mom what is happening and to hurry up and we have enough charge and we should go. At this point the lady begins to walk away, but I am still scared and want to get out of here. She agrees and we begin to leave, as we are leaving I notice a guy who is also charging leave his car stand up and walk by the pillars and look at us and the lady, who is now walking away. We begin to exit and see the lady as we are navigating the parking structure. Right before we pass her she turns and eyeballs us with no expression or emotion. \n\nNow this is where it gets crazy, as we exit the parking structure, the lady is there looking at us on the sidewalk, she does not need to turn her head as her body is 100% aligned with our car. It is as if she knew we would exit at that exit (there are at least 3 others) and at that time. Keep in mind, we were literally 6 flours up and she descended 6 flours on foot and walked to that exit, faster than we could drive? WTF, now to add to that me and my mom are reasonable afraid, I tell her to calm down and drive home where we can talk about it safely. As we are driving home I notice my mom in the blind spot of a car, I tell her to get out of there. And as we do so the lane changes right behind us over all five lanes of the highway. Luckily we make it home safely. \n\nI have never felt afraid or scared in this way, I hope this is just a series of coincidences or a crackhead.  If anything, similar happened to you please let me know.",

        "text": "I live in a small city, actually in a normal urban neighbourhood. I heard these sounds again on 3 a.m. at night it's the second time but different from the first time. It's some kind of heavy growl, it's not humanlike and it sounds big. This time it moved very fast, it does growl like once in 10 seconds. It was close to here for a short time and I heard it later in the distance.\n\nI don't have any kind of forest nearby. There's a playground a bit away with a lot of big dense bushes around it and if you follow the road there's an area with a lot of  trees but it's still urban. It did move to there based on where the sounds were going.\n\nSo the first time I heard this but a lot quieter sound, it was actually in my quite big alley behind my garden. That was like from 1 a.m. till 4 a.m. and it would knock on the barnes. Of course I was frightened but I brushed it off since I never heard it since.\n\nI did tell my parents. And my mom was like there's not a lot of options of what it can be refering to the usual animals in the area.\n\nI know a lot about animal sounds and foxes or dogs don't sound like that.\n\nThere's no news or anything about this I can find online, I don't hear any people either.\n\nI've actually always believed in Bigfoot.\n\nI don't go outside at night here anymore, that's for sure.",

        "text": "A true story: \n\nIn the Dominican Republic, my grandmother's room in her house has always given me an eerie feeling. Last time I was there, I was turning 20 and had to sleep in her room while visiting. The whole month I was there, I would wake up at 3am no matter what. I could've been drunk and gone to sleep at 2am, and I'd still wake up at 3. It was ridiculous. The night before my birthday I had strange dreams (my eyes are tearing up from the memory), one of them being a documentary of centipedes with human faces. The narrator in the documentary was literally explaining what I was looking at with exact details. I woke up and felt an eerie presence in the room, and of course, it's 3am. I turned on the light and read the Bible on my grandma's drawer. After a few minutes I decided to go back to sleep with the light on, and I also turned on the fan and put it on medium. I fell into another dream where I was on a public bus. I saw a girl exit the bus, but she left her sweater. Next thing I know the sweater is in my hands and I'm following her into a school. The moment I entered, I would only see her turning corners until she disappeared. Somehow, I had a picture of her on my phone and asked around the school if anyone knew her, so that I could return her sweater. I'm walking around the halls, opening classroom doors to try and find her, but no luck. Eventually, I found one door that looked different from the others. The moment I entered, it was pretty bright, and when things cleared up, I noticed I was in the same room I was sleeping in, in real life. I still didn't realize what was going on. I went on my cellphone and noticed it was acting very weird. Then, I looked at the mirror in the room and noticed things were off in the reflection. My cellphone wasn't taking my inputs at the moment and that's when I realized I was in some fucked up dream.  Right at that moment I felt something in my body just warning me that something weird was about to happen. That's when the stool in the room shot up into the ceiling and shattered into many pieces (I can't stop tearing from how real that felt, it still feels like yesterday). At that moment I felt a shock and was able to open my eyes. I couldn't move at all, so I figured I was going through sleep paralysis, but it was maybe 10 or 20 times stronger than any other time it's happened to me in the past. I noticed that the light was still on, but it was shining brighter than I'd ever seen it, the fan -that I had on medium- was spinning so fast, it sounded like it was gonna break off any second and slice me. There was a wind in the room that felt so ominous and disgusting, and I could hear the cries of a spirit or something. I spent about a minute or 2 like that fighting back whatever was in that room. It felt like I had literal claws on my throat. When I finally broke free I quickly ran out of the room, and I left everything exactly the way it was. The door even shut on its own from all the wind in the room. I went to get my brother and sister in law at the time across the hall from me. They were in a panic, but as I explained to them what happened they didn't believe me until we all went in there again. The first thing that we noticed was that the light turned off by itself, the fan was still whirring very fast and all 3 of us had our hairs rise up on every inch of our body. We prayed in Jesus name and everything started to calm down. The wind died down, the light was back to normal and the fan went back to medium. I haven't been back in that house since and I could keep going about what happened after, but I know I've said too much. I know I'll have doubters, but it's the God honest truth. I never really believed in such paranormal bullshit until it happened to me. I'm not the only one in my family either that's had very strange feelings about my grandmother's room. You could walk in that house and immediately tell that something's off about that room.",

        "text": "This is going to be a bit longish of a story.\n It happened a long time ago (1970?)and a lot of the people it happened to are gone now. \n However my oldest brother remembers it pretty well and my 2nd oldest brother remembers a few things that happened around him as well. \n I don't remember any of this at all as I was the newborn baby :)\n I was told this story many times by my mother and my brothers and sister and many cousins witnessed it and swore it all happened.\n So apparently there was this older lady who was related on the opposite bloodline of ours to one of our cousins. (Alma ) The old lady was very ill and knew she was dying. She talked to my cousin about some cookbooks she wanted her to have when she passed away because she knew that Alma liked cooking and she wanted her to have them. \n\nShe was very specific though about 3 or 4 \"special\" cookbooks that she wanted to go to her daughters. \n Maybe they had some special family recipes in them or something? Any how she was very clear that Alma was not to take these cookbooks ,but everything else was ok.\n So eventually the old lady passed away and they were clearing out her things.\n My cousin Alma took the cookbooks she was told she could have and for some stupid reason she took the ones that the old lady specifically wanted her daughters to have as well. I don't know where her daughters were at this time but I was told that she basically stole these books that were meant for someone else.\n So now the way my mom told it my cousin was out for the old ladies funeral and stuff and she came out to stay at our house.\nMy mom said when she was talking to her on the phone just before she came over that she found it strange because the phone line was very static and crackley sounding like a really bad connection,which in fairness it could have been. But my mom in hindsight thought it may have been what she later brought to our house with her.\n So I am not sure how long this stuff lasted for but I know it was for quite a few days at least.\n As soon as Alma came to our house to stay for a bit is when it all started. She had brought the things that had been left to her by the old lady as well as the books she took without permission.\n  Weird things started happening almost immediately. Knocks and bumps in the walls.\n Silverware in the cabinets jingling and moving inside the drawers on its own. Like you could hear it rattling and bumping together metallic sounding noises.\n They would go to bed and under the covers of a fully made undisturbed bed they would find cutlery like butter knives spoons and forks just sitting there \n Alma was getting the worst of this stuff though and she would hear knocks and bangs in her room or under her bed. Her hair would get pulled in her sleep and other stuff that basically was not letting her rest.\n During this time my middle brother says he saw books move on their own. (The cookbooks I assume?) Also a whittled very distinct piece of wood someone was messing around carving with  got thrown out in the woods when they were done with it. When they came back into the house that exact same piece of wood was on the stove.\n Things kept getting weirder and louder and my mom was getting really scared one day and they all went into the bedroom I was sleeping in as a baby. I guess it was quite a commotion going on in the house and they all ran into my room to be safe together and make sure I was ok.\n  Whatever this entity was would not go in the room where I was for some reason. Anyhow they were all in the room I was in and they could hear this thing scratching on the door and rattling it. They heard a disembodied voice speak as it was messing with the door. All they heard was was it say in a raspy croaky voice was  the word COOK! COOK! COOK!\n My cousin then broke down and confessed to my mom that she had taken cookbooks that were not for her. My mom was very upset with her and told her to take the books back to the old ladies house that morning.\n The morning they were taking the books back my sister was going with Alma because she was too scared to go there on her own after all that happened.\n My sister was holding the stack of books and Alma said she was done with them all and was going to take them all back  Just as she said that each book she stole came off the stack my sister was holding and each one landed right on top of the other on the floor perfectly on top of each other one at a time.\n Alma did not want anything more to do with anything from that house and returned all of it.\n All activity in our house stopped after that and all was good \n The question I have is why would it be avoiding an infant's room? (Maybe she just liked babies?)\n One other thing I forgot to mention also is my mom tried some pickle recipes from some of these cookbooks before she knew that some were stolen. She said everything she made was messed up and didn't turn out properly. In weird ways like dill pickles becoming almost jelly like etc.\n If you made it all the way to this thanks a lot. I have been waiting a long time to tell this story.\n I know a lot of people will say this is all made up but it is true as it was told to me by my family and family friends that saw things happen as well.\n TDLTR when I was a baby my cousin stole a bunch of cookbooks and we were haunted until she returned them",

Late last week week we decided to check out an area called pleasant valley. To my knowledge, this area has a deep rooted history with the underground railroad, indigenous peoples, aswell as the war of 1812 if i am not mistaken given its proximity to lake erie. \n\nWe entered the woods at about 2am and immediately upon entering i was overcome with a bad feeling and after walking for some time the feeling progressively worsened until we reached 2 bent trees in an x over the path. My one buddy pointed out the fact that its bad juju to go underneath and we should just call it a night as we all felt watched. As soon as we turn around and start to head back, the entire forest seemed dramatically quieter we all hear a loud, distinctively human whistle behind us. There is no way anyone could have been out there at that hour and there is no homes in close enough proximity for someone to be out and about. We all ran and I was honestly terrified me and my friends are all relatively big guys and we are all comfortable in the woods so it takes alot to get us running lol. \n\nAny ideas?",

        "text": "It happened in 2010, I was in my hostel preparing for the exam next day. I slept late that night, after finishing my preparations. I usually don't have dreams, but that day, I have the most vivid dream. In that dream I saw my grandmother, preparing to wash her clothes and talking to me. She said the exact word, I still remember \"Look, what your aunt have done to me? \" She repeated that statement 3-4 times and I was looking at her face clearly, then suddenly my aunt's face appeared in my dream. As soon as my aunt face appeared, I woke up and saw the time it was 4 in the morning. So I wake up, did a revision for my exam and didn't even think about that dream. I went for my exam that day. Almost after 13 days, I got to know by my father that my grandmother is no more and she died on the day before my exam. I was shocked, it took me a while to process everything. My grandmother and my family weren't on good terms, she lived with my aunt her whole life. Me and my grandmother, never really interacted much, but yes I respected her and loved her the way she was. \nAfter getting the news of her death, suddenly that dream crossed my mind and I was confused, sad and mourning at the same time. I still don't know what to think of it. In her last days, my family's relationship with grandmother deteriorated to the point, we didn't even talk to her. It was all due to my aunt, after grandmother's death, she inherited all her belongings, We got nothing. \nI have no idea, why I saw that dream that too on the same day, she died.",

A dark shadow figure in the shape of a tall man with a hat. I battled with my parents over this presence that would appear to me when the sun would set. My mom would get very angry at me when I was young, because I would rather stand in the hallway in complete darkness all night out of fear, or they would find me sleeping on any bed or room that wasn‚Äôt mine as long as I wasn‚Äôt alone. My mom would complain that I was scaring her, but the truth is I was more scared. I would hear tapping every night by my bed followed by the outline of a tall man. finally, I was given holy water and the day I put it on that wall it was a blessing and issue resolved. It disappeared the SAME day. Or so I thought. I didn‚Äôt have problems in that house. Moving forward, I‚Äôm having issues with tapping on the walls once more, only this time it‚Äôs in a freshly built home. It follows me around from bedroom,to kitchen, to living room. Only when I‚Äôm up late enough to hear it. When I mention it or try to record it, the tapping sounds immediately cease. It‚Äôs only targeting me for attention. I ignored it for a long time hoping it was all some explainable coincidence. However, today I finally captured a video that makes me sick to my stomach. I was up late around 2am, when I heard knocking on the corner of the wall. I decided to listen for a bit and then pull out the camera to record. Of course it immediately stopped, i instigated by knocking on the wall. It knocked back at me, mocking the same exact knock I made. \nI‚Äôm in shock and disbelief. If anyone has dealt with this or can help please do. I‚Äôm not in any immediate danger but this is a cry for help. I need this away from me and my family. I will show my mom the video and other evidence I have gathered in the morning. Any advice is welcome.",

        "text": "I can't say that I know much about shadow people. I watched The Why Files today and learned about them for the first time and it inspired me to share my story. IDK what to consider this, but here goes.\n\nI live in a small canyon town in the mountains. The meme of \"everyone knows everyone\" isn't quite how it is out here, but everyone has at least seen everyone so you notice when out of town people show up. This takes place around 2001. We have one road that goes through the town and in the middle of the town is a liquor store with a gas pump and a cafe attached to the same building. \n\nI have been noticing this new woman in town for about 2 weeks. She's attractive and my age and she's got a small child with her when I see her around the store. One day I am standing behind her in line at the store to buy some gas and her kid is looking back at me. The thing is, it's like he was looking past me. He was clearly looking over my shoulder. I turned around to see if someone was behind me, but nobody was there. This happened in the store again the next time that I saw the two of them. At the time I didn't put too much thought into it and just figured that this little kid was a bit weird.\n\nFast forward a week and I meet her husband \"John\". John invites me over to their place to hang out with them. The woman \"Mary\" and their 4 year old son \"Tony\" are on the back patio deck. John introduces me and we all chat for a while. It's clear from the get go that Tony isn't a weird kid but that he's what I would consider exceptionally gifted. At 4 years old he knew his phone number, address, how to write his first and last name, could count to 100, and could read. Not only that but he was emotionally mature for his age. He wasn't whining, acting up in any way at all. He was polite and there was just something about him that I can't put my finger on, but I guess that's all I can really say to describe it. One of those people who just have something about them that sets them apart from others.\n\nJohn and Mary get a phone call and have to go inside to talk to someone and it's just Tony and I on the patio deck talking. He starts asking me: \"Who are you?\" I tell him my name again, and he asks: \"Who is that with you?\" He did this very seriously, not in a joking manner at all. Then he's looking over my shoulder again like there is someone behind me. I turn around and again there is nothing. He repeats the questions again. So I ask him if he see's someone behind me and he says that he does. At this point his parents come back out and they tell me that they have to head out. I never mentioned this conversation to them or brought it up with Tony again when I saw him on other occasions. The family lived in my town for about 4 months before getting a divorce and moving away. I only saw them again a few more times.\n\nI really don't know anything about shadow people. I had heard of them before but never crawled into that rabbit hole. Even after this experience that happened to me over 20 years ago I just thought that I had maybe a ghost with me. Watching The Why Files episode tonight inspired me to post about this experience because of what happened to me earlier today. Briefly in the video the host was talking about how some people hear a wooshing noise associated with shadow people.\n\nSo, 2 years ago I was diagnosed with circulation problems. To avoid getting blood clots I have to hike every day no matter what. I have a trail that leads up a mountain very close to my house. I've hiked this trail every day for 2 and a half years, and have been hiking it on a pretty regular basis just for exercise for the last 15. Needless to say, I know this trail and mountain. I know every sound it makes. I know every animal noise that can be heard there. \n\nToday was a beautiful warm and calm day for December. I was coming down the trail and it was dead quiet. There wasn't any wind today which is rare and I was really enjoying my hike and the warm weather. About a third of the way down from the top of the trail I stop because I hear this wooshing sound. It's like a low pitched whistle that started instantly, went on at the same pitch for about 5 to 7 seconds, and then stopped instantly. It was silence, wooshing, silence. There was no way that the wind made that noise. I have no idea what caused it. But after having my experience with Tony, seeing The Why Files mentioning wooshing sounds associated with shadow people, it brought back my memory of Tony and I wanted to share it here. \n\nAnyways that's my story. If anyone has any insight on shadow people or if they have heard a similar wooshing sound I'd like to hear about it. I'm kind of fascinated with the subject now. The timing of that video and my hike today really strikes me as more than a coincidence. Like maybe I'm supposed to get some sort of meaning out of all of this.",

Paterson N.J 1998-1999 I was about 8-9 years old  my mom and step dad where in the kitchen finishing up cooking dinner I was in my living room playing Nintendo I belive duck hunt my little brother was sitting next to me a huge rock went through our living room window. So panick obviously  cops called etc well my mom tells me to go into my room and take my brother  he still freaking out so he stays with my mom I take the Nintendo with my I go to my room but I freeze its dark and I see a silhouette of a person out side my window. I'm just staring but I don't flip my light on. I flipped it off and immediately it slammed my window sil   and pressed itself against my window and all I see is bright red eyes.  I was terrified so terrified I had my mom tape my windows up I'm traumatized by red lights I start seeing red eyes from a distance. I was so scared.  Moving years later 2010 im 20 years old and I moved back to NJ from California. Mom driving and stops asked me you remember this place and I get out the car notice the back yard was unlocked  and no one lived there I go to the window to my old room and realize w.e was huge and tall. I'm 6'5 and the center of the window was easy 7-8ft from the ground. I then started studying demonology  trying to maybe come across of what I say when I was a kid. Now this is where it gets interesting Dec. 2020 my now ex wife came to visit from book camp were having a bad argument my kids are asleep but I hear someone crying in the bathroom and it's my oldest she was 12 at the time and I start to apologize for the fighting she starts yelling at me \"there something in my.room dad!!!\" So I'm telling her there's nothing your watching to much ghost adventures and horror movie just go to sleep she yells \"YOUR NOT LISTENING TO ME THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE ROOM STARING AT ME!!\" so I tell her ok draw what you see  5 mins later she hands me a piece of paper and I look and immediately freeze she draws the same thing I saw in NJ when i was a kid but very very detailed. I never told her about it. It was solid black with long black arms and legs claws on hands and feet with sharp teeth and she says it's crouched in the corner but when it stands up it's almost to the ceiling. I calmly tell my wife stay with her  in my  room and I call my friend up and start explaining. I go into my daughter's room turn off all the lights and sit on her bed staring at the corner of the room I have him on video chat and turn the camera facing the corner. There was this ominous dark shadow in the corner. My friend cause he claims to be a median starts speaking for it to leave next thing I feeling is a cold breathing feeling in my ear but I don't budge  then gone. I notice it makes it appearance during chaotic conflicts it feeds off anger and violence.  I seen posts about shadow people and hat man. But I feel this entity is way different due to. When negative energy is at is highest it has shown itself if anyone has seen anything like this or done research be free to comment.  I haven't found anything and I been digging for over 2 decades.",

The room I had the experience in belonged to a very Alzheimer‚Äôs effected lady. She would say things like there are people looking at her through the window and talk to the people in her room.\n\nThat‚Äôs normal and didn‚Äôt make me think she was seeing actual spirits. But then I saw something I can‚Äôt explain. Her call light went off in her room. But I was confused because she was not in her room. She was at an activity. So I start walking towards the room, down the hallway and I see a shadow of a person. No face. No features, just a shadow. Except it‚Äôs not on the wall it‚Äôs in the hall way, in front of the room. I keep walking towards the room and it starts to move into the room. The doors open so we both are moving towards the room and go through the door. It enters the room and disappears around the corner towards the call light. \n\nAt first standing in the room I was scared and tears welled up in my eyes but then I just walked out and didn‚Äôt really think much about it again. Didn‚Äôt tell anyone either.\n\nUntil two weeks later I‚Äôm in the same room with another CNA and she brings up the dark figure that appears in this room and another room. And I‚Äôm like wtf I saw it two weekends ago. She went on to tell me a few other experiences people have had and I‚Äôm just in shock. Just thought I‚Äôd share my story! \n\nWas this a shadow person or just a ghost?",

        "text": "I've only told about 5 people this story, but wanted to share it with other like minded people to try to understand this experience better. So this all took place in 2016-2017 in Central GA about 45 minutes from Macon. I've always been fascinated with the paranormal and have had countless experiences from my childhood. So I was hanging out with my friends when the topic comes up. Of course most of my other friends are very skeptic and I suggested we go somewhere haunted. There is a local legend here about a road with 5 bridges (ironicly its called 3 bridges road to locals) and I told my friends we should check it out. We get there at about 1 am and stay a couple hours. There were a few strange sounds we heard and a dark heavy feeling, but not much else. One of my friends claims that he saw a woman, but nobody else did so we figured it was just his imagination. After we are done with the bridges we go to the church that's right beside them. Now this church is to put it plainly weird and creepy. It had blacked out windows, no steeple, and a small cemetery with graves that date back to the 1790s. We get a much stronger feeling here and decide to head back to my buddies camper and chill. Fast forward a couple days, and one of my friends gunther claims that he has been seeing a \"tar lady\" as he called her ever since we did our little ghost hunting trip. So me trying to help him feel better, decide to cleanse his camper (mind you I've never done this before) so I just start saying \"any negative entity I command you to leave you are not welcome here\" over and over. After about 3 minutes I feel an immense pressure and weight like carrying a 100 lbs bookbag or something. The lights start to flicker, but I keep on. My friend tells me that there are entities pointing at me laughing and mocking. I don't see anything so I continue for about 10 minutes until it's too much to bear. I run outside and start puking, and my friend tells me I have dark circles around my eyes. I feel like I had the worst hangover in history. I tell him I have to leave and go back home. I feel ok the next day, so we ask another friend rick (who didn't go with us the first time) for help. He is a pagan and is really knowledgeable on the occult and supernatural lore. We go back to the church, and he looks around for a minute and just says \" this isn't hallowed ground\" we ask what he is talking about and he says that a church should be on hallowed ground and especially cemeteries. He implies that something weird is going on and that he suspects that the people of this church might be practicing dark arts. I'm pretty nervous at this and me and my friend gunther look at each other. Rick then says he can help Gunther and they go to his camper alone. The next day I check up on Gunther and he says he is alright now, that Rick gave him something that will protect him. I ask what is was and he said it's a \"demon lord\" that Rick had a contract with. Gunther said he had to accept the demon and did. I was very skeptical and pretty much thought they were full of crap. Over the course of the next few weeks I would be hanging out with Gunther and his demeanor would completely change. He isn't dumb or anything but he is simple and speaks plainly. When this thing would take over he would speak very articulate and sophisticated. He also wouldn't say \"I\" when speaking about himself he would say \"gunther\". So I tested this theory by asking it to prove that it was real and not just imagination gone wild or maybe split personalities. It told me a traumatic event I witnessed as a child that I damn sure didn't tell anyone because my mind tried to erase it. When it said this I was filled with uncontrollable rage and my other friends had to stop me from hitting him. All the while this thing in my friend had a huge grin on its face. After I calm down I ask differnt questions and it confirmed it was a demon lord it told me how gunthers step grandma was using witchcraft, and about the cult at the church trying to open a portal. The only time I made it angry was when I was helping a friend Tiffany who had a negative entity attached to her. The demon was with us and we had 2 candles lit. I started saying a prayer over Tiffany to get the evil spirit out. She was screaming in pain, and her back arched backwards in a sickening way. The demon lord was saying a chant under his breath the whole time with his eyes completely closed. After the entity was out of her, I used the opportunity to move my hand and intention to my friend gunther who still had his eyes closed, and kept saying the same prayer. His eyes shot open immediately and the look he had was pure hatred. He looked me dead in the eye and said \"don't fuck with me\" then grabbed both candles and blew them out simultaneously. I have alot of other stories about this demon lord and of other unrelated paranormal experiences, but this is the one that will always be the creepiest. Let me know if you guys would like to hear more. On a side note, we went to the church one night on Halloween and at 3 am at a supposed Christian church there were people in a back room of the church huddled in a circle with a table and peice of cloth etched with symbols in the center. We ran outta there as fast as we could that night.",

        "text": "My grandfather who I was close with my entire life recently passed away in October of 2022. The news was given he had 1-5 years and rapidly declined so fast he only made it a month. The news was a devastating blow to my family. My grandfather was the wisest and most organized man I had ever met. He retired young, raised 3 children with my grandmother and had 3 grand children including myself. He was always someone I wanted advice from. However, he was also the funniest and most friendly man with the biggest heart. He had his stern side as well. If he told you to do something‚Ä¶you did it no questions asked he just had that way about him. \n\nUnfortunately the last time I saw him was in 2019 before I moved states away and the last conversation I had with him was over Facebook when I gave him reassurance that his last heart surgery would be a success and I told him I loved him.\n\nAfter he passed I took only a few days of bereavement leave from my job and notified only my boss to explain the situation.\nFast forward to now (a couple months later) I‚Äôve had some time to grieve and accept the finality of the situation as have the rest of my family. I work in auto finance in customer service and was recently promoted to a team leader in august before he passed. In November I took over a brand new team of new hires to the company. I spent the month getting to know my new team and the different personalities. One man on my team is an older gentleman who is very religious. I myself can‚Äôt say I ever considered myself to be religious but after todays experience I can‚Äôt say my opinion remains the same.\n\nThis morning I arrived at my office earlier than normal, I had purchased some gifts for my team and wanted to have it set up for them when they all came in since it was our last day in office before Christmas. My team arrived and I proceeded to start my day as normal. As I walk past this particular team members desk he asked me if I knew somebody in my life by the name of (my grandfathers name). I was taken aback and said ‚Äúyes I do, why do you ask?‚Äù This team member proceeded to tell me that he saw my grandfather standing by my desk and he told him that ‚ÄúI need to keep my family close and that he was proud of me.‚Äù The team member then went on to explain that the man he spoke to came off as stern and asked him to come here and without hesitation the team member felt he needed to get to him with urgency. He went on to explain that he had his angel wings and was in heaven and looking after me and my family.\n\nI sat back and tried to think logically about this experience. How did he know this stuff? Did he stalk my Facebook? No because not only is my page completely private, but not one post was made about my grandfather on my page or any of my families. Did I tell anybody at all at work my grandfathers name? No, I didn‚Äôt. There was no logical explanation for this team member of mine to make these unusually specific claims.  What really struck me was the statement ‚Äúkeep your family close‚Äù. while vague, my grandfather was really the glue that held us together. I‚Äôm close with my mother who now lives in the same state I moved to. But my aunt and uncle and grandmother still live in my old state and my aunt and uncle don‚Äôt get along. I truly believe that he‚Äôs worried about the family breaking apart and living separate lives now that he is gone.\n\nSo why am I writing this? I‚Äôm not really sure. Closure I suppose? But mainly because I want to know if anybody has any similar experiences. From what I‚Äôve read on religion people do not become angels after they die. So why would he have wings? I‚Äôm confused, baffled and comforted by all of this.",

I suddenly feel the sheets being pulled off of me over the edge and I grab them back tightly and yell out \"stop it Seth!\" He is my younger cousin and thought he was playing a trick on me and hiding from me underneath but heard no answer. I thought he could be under the bed but that wouldn't make sense because he's like 5 years old and that would be terrifying for him. Few minutes later my mom walks in to check in and chat with me, and I just tell her to leave the door open a crack  for light. I don't recall being overly scared, but I always wondered what that was.",

Personally, I have never seen/experienced anything paranormal at all in my life, so I am not really a believer simply because I have no reference point for myself (in saying that, I respect peoples experiences completely). However, these paranormal sights can become so much so that he gets scared of, what seems to me, nothing. He claims he sees ‚Äúblack shadows‚Äù and they they are evil spirits. He also sees white shadows and he doesn‚Äôt care because those are good spirits. He has claimed to see demons in the flesh in the past. He says that he sees spirits all the time and they are just a part of his world. I asked him why I don‚Äôt see them and he says that I have not ‚Äúopened my third eye‚Äù. I originally considered that he has some mental illness/difference, but it wouldn‚Äôt start at such a young age (he claims around 4 years old). He also gets lots of nightmares if that means anything. I have heard of paranormal experiences before, but it is usually a rare occurrence for people, not an everyday phenomenon. I was just curious to get this subreddit‚Äôs opinion on the whole situation.",

        "text": "This isn‚Äôt scary or anything like that, but still very weird to me. Earlier this year, like April or may I think, I was steelhead fishing in Michigan‚Äôs upper peninsula. I walked back in along a river, about a mile. Super beautiful, reminded me of the Pacific Northwest. \n\nEventually I came across a massive white pine, like 10 feet back in off the bank right after a bend. When I say massive I mean this was the biggest tree I‚Äôve seen in Michigan. My rod was 10‚Äô6‚Äù and when I compared the two the tree looked about 10‚Äô in diameter. Hard to believe for modern times, seeing how most white pine barely gets to 3‚Äô anymore. I was in awe. My cousin took a picture but the angle didn‚Äôt do it justice. \n\nFast forward to October, and I was back for the salmon run. Got done fishing at the lake, so we went back in on the river again. Tried a couple spots, ended up near the tree. I wanted to see it again, so I started walking along the river. I got to a place that seemed like where it was, but there was nothing there. Oh well, I guess I just need to keep going. I kept walking, but I got to a place I hadn‚Äôt seen before. Confused, I walked back to the first spot. This was definitely where it was, because it was right after a bend in the river. But like I said there was nothing there. I know they didn‚Äôt cut it down, as it was state land and they don‚Äôt log there. Even to get to it they‚Äôd have to clear cut a path. Plus there was no stump, and no disturbance where the roots would have been. Just the same pad of lichen and moss that was there in the spring. It didn‚Äôt fall over, and it didn‚Äôt burn down. \nI honestly have no clue what happened to it. I am certain it‚Äôs the same spot, and none of us could find the tree. Have any of you had this or anything like this happen?",

        "text": "A couple of months ago, me, my dad and my stepmom went to Ioannina, specifically on the island in the middle of the lake, in Greece, where i lived at the time. There i bought a cool looking yet cheap dagger. It's not sharp, i just bought it to look cool on my desk. \n\nWhen i went back home the very same day, my friend who is into witchcraft and such told me that i could use it for spells and stuff. So, without believing in these things at the time, i tried a ritual in which you talk with spirits. It's basically like a ouija board but with a lit candle and some thread.\n\nI won't go into detail about how the ritual is done, but you basically just talk with spirits. I didn't believe it would work at the time so i messed around and did everything my friend told me not to do. That was definitely not a good idea though, because apparently it's all real. Ghosts, or rather spirits, beings beyond our senses and comprehension, and even demons.\n\nI know unknown beings are real ever since my other paranormal experience but i've posted about that before, but i was not expecting ghosts and demons to exist as well. Anyhow, after i messed around with the ritual, i had angered the spirit i communicated with. \n\nWhen i asked it questions, it told me it was a 42 year old man from the UK named Geoff, who died in an accident at a supermarket. After i finished talking to him, i unknowingly ended the ritual incorrectly, and then i headed to bed. As i was trying to sleep though, Geoff showed some concerning signs.\n\nAs i was in bed, I could hear footsteps in the room with me, but when i looked around there was nobody there. When i finally fell asleep though came the worst part. Geoff haunted my dreams. I saw that i was in a family gathering at my grandmother's house, where i lived at the time this whole thing happened. In the dream, i recognised everyone there except one guy. He appeared to be a cousin of mine, with which i got along pretty well. His name was Jason.\n\nAs i was playing around with him, i decided to mess with him a little. He was pushing me through the hallway and i thought it would be funny to suddenly let go and let him fall. But he fell kinda diagonally and hit his head on the kitchen doorframe, dying in the process. To say the least, this dream left me unable to forget it. Anyway, i was so scared that i ran away, out of the house. I ran across the road and then turned randomly when suddenly i realised i was outside my old house, where i once lived with my parents.\n\nI took out my keys and looked at them and in the dream i still had the keys to the place. It is an appartment building so there were two keys. I opened the door to the building and then entered the elevator. There were originally four floors, so there were five buttons on the aged elevator, including the ground floor. But in my dream, there was a sixth button with no number beside it, between floor 3 and 4.\n\nOut of curiosity, i pressed it and waited for the elevator to stop. After i got out, everything got a bit darker, as if i lowered the brightness in a videogame. The floor itself was almost identical to the second floor of the building down to the smallest details, except there were strange pieces of wood as decoration on little shelves in the building hallway.\n\ni grabbed one for some reason and went upstairs, expecting to see the third or fourth floor, hoping for the darkness to dissapear, since this was some weird version of the second. I saw the third floor, but the darkness was still there. I put my key in the apartment front door and opened it. When i walked inside it was completely identical to the real apartment when i lived there.\n\nBesides the place itself and the darkness, there were small dark entities floating around, like little black ghosts. They had faces too, but it was as if they were made of smoke. When i swung the stick i took earlier at one of them, its face got all distorted like a bunch of smoke when you swing at it. After that, i took a dhort pause to evaluate the situation and realized that all the little ghosts were singing.\n\nEvery entity was singing a different melody, but they all had the same voice; the creepy female text to speech, almost whispering, like the ones in the analog horror videos. After that, i curled up scared in the corner of the living room, between the couch and the TV. After a few seconds of fear, i woke up at 5 AM to a brief image of a very scary face staring at me and then reality. \n\nBelieve me, i know this sounds casual, but ever since that incident, i believe in both witchcraft and spirits. Never messing with this kind of stuff again.",
