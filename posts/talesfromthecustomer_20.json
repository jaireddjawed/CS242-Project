        "text": "Note: This happened about 6 years ago - in early 2011.\n\nFor years my family had taken our pets to a vet clinic associated with a rather large pet-supply chain.  For the most part, everything had gone well enough before this event.\n\nI had adopted a sweet little cat in early 2011.  This cat was my first time owning a pet as an adult, independent of my family.  I figured, it would be simple to get my new kitty set up with my family's old vet clinic, and initially it was.\n\nBut then came time to snip-off kitty's balls.\n\nThe morning of the appointment, I dropped him off at the clinic, check-in went simple enough.\n\nAround an hour or so later I get a call that my cat won't be able to have the procedure done that day, as the vet has discovered a minor ear infection.  I ask if I can come in to pick him up, and they say he's ready when I am.\n\nSo I go in to the clinic, walk up to the front desk, and ask to have my cat checked out, and to go over what we need to do to help clear up his ear-infection.\n\nThe woman at the reception desk gives me a very odd look, and says I must be mistaken, my cat is prepped and headed in for surgery *right now*.\n\nI ask if she's sure, someone from the clinic had called me not 10 minutes earlier to ask me to come in and pick my cat up.\n\nNo, she says - she's sure he's prepped and I will receive a call once he's good to be picked up.  She goes back to what she's doing on the computer and seems to have decided the conversation is done.  I'm nervous, and I felt uncomfortable pressing her further.\n\nIn hindsight, I should have.\n\nBut - I accepted what she said, and I left the clinic feeling slightly disoriented.  Maybe they'd called the wrong person initially about the ear-infection?\n\nSo I go home, and I wait....and I keep waiting....well beyond when the surgery should have been completed.  Eventually, just as I'm getting worried enough to call the clinic (which will be closed in the next 15 minutes), my phone rings.  \n\nImmediately, the person calling begins to reprimand me.\n\nYOU DO REALIZE THAT YOU NEED TO COME PICK UP YOUR CAT **TODAY**?  HE HAS BEEN SITTING HERE SINCE NOON, WE CAN'T KEEP HIM HERE ALL NIGHT.\n\nI'm incredibly taken aback and state that I had already attempted to pick him up that afternoon, but had been sent away as he was in surgery. \n\nShe scoffed at me, and said the clinic would be closing in 10 minutes, and if I wasn't there to pick up my cat, I wouldn't be able to get him back until the next day.\n\nI rushed into the office-- turns out my cat did, in fact, have an ear infection, and had been sitting at the clinic all day, waiting for me.  \n\nMy frustration was mostly with myself for not following my gut initially and pressing the woman at reception to double check on my cat.  At the same time I was so angry with how I had been spoken to, as though I was a neglectful owner, when in reality is was the error of the clinic.  \n\nAfter receiving the appropriate antibiotics, I made an appointment with a new (friend recommended) vet.  Things went smoothly after that.  \n",

        "text": "Ftp, on mobile, sorry for shitty story telling skills. \n\nI’m at college studying hospitality and I’ve worked in retail/food service for about 6 years now. I’ve seen all the mean/rude/awful things people can do in these scenes, but this blew me away.\n\nA group of my friends, 7 of us, went out to a chain burger restaurant in our city. We sat down and we all ordered waters, some people ordered shakes. Instead of bringing out 7 cups of water, the server brought us 7 of those dinky little plastic cups that you use at the dentists office to rinse out your bleeding gums and one supersized cup full of water. She said “I figured this would be easier than me making multiple trips.” Uhhhhhhh ok? \n\nWhatever, it’s water, she’ll bring more. So we begin ordering. As she realizes that we are all ordering a side of fries (they were a la carte) she says “ya know, it’d take me a lot less time to make only 4 orders of fries instead of 7.” And we told her we understood, but we preferred 7 orders. She kinda rolled her eyes and kept going. \n\nGuess what. When our food came out, there were only 4 baskets of fries. We asked about it and she said she told us that it’d take her less time.\n\nAt this time, we are so ready to leave so we quickly eat and ask for the checks all separate, which this restaurant was able to do for such a large party. We sign our checks, leave less than decent tips, and leave.\n\nA few days later, my friend checks her bank statement and sees that she paid a few more dollars than what her copy of the receipt said. So the b*tch stole from us too. \n\nTl;dr: waitress cuts corners to make it easier on herself and steals tip money",

My boyfriend and I tip very well, because again, we've been there and good servers deserve it.\n\nWe have a local Mexican joint near us that my boyfriend used to love, he wanted to take me. We walked in and stood for a few minutes before the hostess walked past us with her head down, no eye contact and goes \"come on\" \n\nThere was one party of 10 down the center and every booth was dirty and full of cups/plates. She sat us at a dirty table right next to the 10 top and walked away. \n\nReturned ten minutes later with chips and salsa, no words just plopped them down and left. \nWe watched one poor waiter running around frantically trying to cater to the larger table. He noticed us after we had been there for 25 mins with no drinks and no one had come over past grumpy chip hostess. While we could see the rest of the staff at the counter just talking.\n\nHe aplogized and said he'd be right with us if no one had been over. My boyfriend asked if we could just pay for the chips and head out. The waiter sympathized and was very aware of how poorly things were going. He said not to worry about it and have a great night. \n\nWe left. \nI felt bad, but it was awful. Sorry good hearted waiter dude, hope that 10 top tipped you well and your night ended on a good note. \n\n",

        "text": "So jumping right in, I have a membership to one of those major warehouse club retailers and it’s set to expire this month. A little history to establish the timeline...initially bought a 1 year membership in November of 2015, after it expired last November we didn’t renew immediately. Didn’t get around to it until January of this year. Instead of just giving me a 1 year membership starting in January, they back dated it to when my previous term expired, effectively robbing me of 2 months.\n\nWhich brings us to the present, my membership that was purchased in January of this year is expiring so I go to customer service for assistance. Basically I’m told that there was nothing that could be done. That I should’ve started a new account instead of renewing. Not sure why it’s my job to know that. I tried reasoning with them, but they seemed to lack the understanding that customer service means they’re there to help customers.\n\nI work retail, been a GM for a big box office supply and consumer electronics for the last decade, and almost 5 years of AM and lower positions getting here. It’s shameful how many “managers” don’t understand that policy is a guideline written in black and white, but managers exist because there are many shades of gray. This should’ve been an easy fix, instead they treated me like it was my fault and basically said “sorry not sorry.”\n\nMy wife insists we renew, so I called their corporate customer service number and they’re sending me a gift card worth the missing 2 months as compensation, which I’ll use to offset a portion of the new renewal fee.\n\nIt took 5 minutes.",

        "text": "My family (husband, myself, two kids ages 13 and 7) went to a neighboring city to attend a concert. It was a 45 minute drive from home. \n\nWe attended the concert, which was so good and we had a great time. It was over around 9:30 pm and the kids were hungry. We stopped at Big Red Pepper, since they had the most variety and didn’t close at 10 like most of the other places. \n\nHusband and I ordered appetizers as our entree, and one kid ordered a cheeseburger and the other ordered a cheese quesadilla. We also ordered cheese dip for an actual appetizer and asked for a couple of extra plates so we didn’t have to have the kids reaching over one another and risk spilling drinks. (Dear lord that’s a lot of cheese but everything they had pretty much came with cheese.)\n\nWe got our dip, but no plates. The waitress finally came around when we are almost done with our dip, about 25-30 minutes later. “Oh did you still want those?” \n\nWe were waiting about another 20 minutes and our entrees were still not delivered. She noticed my son drawing on the placemat and started talking about her former career as an airbrush artist and asked my son if he knew how to draw a palm tree. My son is seven and loves talking to people and is kind and outgoing so of course he wanted to know how. She leaned on the table directly in front of me, her upper body ON THE TABLE, to show him how to draw it, on his paper. Those booths are deep so you can imagine how much she had to reach. I couldn’t even reach my drink while she was there.  \n\nAt this point we were just uncomfortable. It had been a long night already and we still had to drive home. The roads to home were curvy two lane highways in the pitch black and lots of deer moving in the area. I was anxious to get home. \n\nWe finally got our food, and she started talking and talking about her granddaughter while we were just nodding and not saying much because we had waited so long for our food. Ours was cold. The cheese in my fried sticks was congealed and hard. My son’s quesadilla was hard. Daughters burger was hot but dry. She came around about ten minutes later and noticed we didn’t eat, did we want a box?  we told her it came out cold, that we had a 45 minute drive so we didn’t want to take it. She offered to microwave it. We declined. Microwaved \n\nThe manager came over and apologized and wanted to give us gift cards and told us our meal was on the house, no worries about the check. He was shifting and talking super fast and by that point we had just had enough. I felt bad but at the same time I wasn’t happy with it and the waitress had made our meal uncomfortable. We just got up and left after that. That was the first time I’d ever not left a tip or anything. \n\nWe try to explain to the kids about service and being kind to servers but when they don’t do their job and you don’t get what you are paying for, or if the order is wrong, speak up. But this was just terrible. It wasn’t even busy that night. We had no adjacent tables in our section. I don’t know why it happened and I can sometimes play devils advocate and empathize with others but I just couldn’t in this case. \n\nOther than that, it was a nice evening. We didn’t let it ruin the entire night.",

We were staying at a hotel overnight because drinking and driving is bad, and it was about 12:30 AM when we decided we couldn't sleep and wanted to make the short trek to a 24 hour burger and shake place with white hats.\n\nA concert had just gotten out, and it was chaos. No big though, boyfriend and I are pretty patient.\n\nWe get sat and our server took our orders. She disappeared pretty quickly (like, almost ran) and I chalked it up to being really busy. \n\nA few minutes go by and we're waiting for our shakes. And waiting. And waiting. And another server brings our food out. Again, no big. I'm a little perplexed as to why the shakes are taking a pretty long time, but who knows. \n\nWe finish our food and we're still waiting on the shakes. I'm a little miffed but hey, I'm sure there's a good reason.\n\nUntil another few minutes pass and I realize that not only has our server not stopped by once, but we can actually see part of the server alley where we're sitting and she seems like she's trying really hard to ignore us. We don't really even see her going to other tables.\n\nShe finally brings our shakes out with a rather half-assed \"sorry for the wait\" and vanishes again. We finish our shakes and are sitting at the table for another 10 minutes, waiting for the check.\n\nSince I'm a server myself and my boyfriend is a decent person, we don't try to wave at her, snap our fingers, our make a \"check\" motion in the air. We try to catch her eye but she doesn't even glance our way. \n\nBy now, a lot of the concert crowd is gone, so I'm expecting that our server can grab the check. \n\nBut she doesn't. She sits at a table with other servers who started rolling silverware and starts chatting away. She catches our eye and ignores us, even though I probably look ready to pay-my wallet is out, cups pushed away, all that stuff. \n\nMy boyfriend asks for the check after a few more minutes and she responds with a chipper, \"of course, sorry baby!\" and pretty much drops it on the table without a word. \n\nWe paid, left, and I figured that I was probably going to go to hell. I still feel bad. But it didn't feel right for me to tip on account of barely receiving any service. ",

        "text": "Hi TalesFromTheCustomer,\n\nFirst time poster in this (I usually post in TalesFromRetail), sorry for any formatting errors. So yeah I work retail, and that's why I was appalled by what had occurred at a popular store that's somewhat like Hell Mart. I'll call it... Bullseye (Sorry if this isn't allowed. When I looked at Anonymizing Rules, both Hell Mart and Paper Clips were allowed. So I'm guessing I can just change the name like that? If I'm not allowed to, let me know.)\n\nAnyways, there was a promotional sale where if you buy at least three eligible items (which were band aids), you could get a leather cosmetic bag for free (and I want to say that the cosmetic bag was really nice). The sign listed the exact brand and how many band aids were in the box (like 50 count or 100 count).\n\nI was with my cousin and she wanted to get the cosmetic bag, so she grabbed one of them and three boxes of band aids. We went to the registers, where it apparently didn't go through. The cashier knew that the promotion was happening, and called the manager over.\n\nThe manager looked, and attempted to insist that there isn't a promotion going on. The cashier even says that the promotion IS going on, but the manager isn't having it. After a few minutes of polite arguing, my cousin goes back to where the sign was, took a photo, and came back, and showed the manager.\n\nThe manager then chose to say \"oh, it's probably an old sign.\" I mean even if it's an old sign, shouldn't you honor it since it was still there? I mean I shouldn't make that assumption since every store has it's own rules of sale signs.\n\nI was trying my best to make sure my cousin wasn't gonna be like those b*tchy customers I get all the time at my store. So my cousin calmly zooms into the sign to where it says how long the sale goes on. She shows it to the manager, but to no avail.\n\nThe manager says that my cousin doesn't have eligible items. My cousin then zooms into the part where it lists the band aids precisely, name, # of band aids in the box, etc. The manager is lost in words.\n\nThe cashier has a realization of some sort, because she went back to the register and clicked the total button. The computer voided the cosmetic bag (the cashier didn't take the bag off, it was the computer, because on the receipt, the bag was still listed but it shows that the price changed due to the sale)\n\nAnyways, we finish our transaction, and we see the manager on our way out. He doesn't say anything to us.\n\n",

        "text": "Once upon a time I was a very very tired mom of three kids three and under. \n\nIn order to make the most of my time and energy I had these little life hacks I’d use. One of these was when I went grocery shopping. Once I had purchased all my items I would place them on the belt leaving all the frozen items together and all the refrigerated ones together at the end of the belt. \n\nMy reasoning was this: when I got home I could throw the frozen stuff in the freezer and the cold stuff in the fridge and leave the rest when I had time. I had three babies and one or more would inevitably throw a fit or have a poopie blow out or need a nap or something insane the second we walked in. Anyone who is a parent can attest to this. It’s just how life works! 😂\n\nSo, like i said, I would separate my items on the belt and say to the cashier “i separated my items for you. Could you please put all the frozen items together and all the refrigerated together and not mix them with anything so when I get home I can put them away quickly. You just never know how it’ll be when you get home with this crew!”  99.99.% of the time they understood and didn’t mind, especially because I had already separated it and I was super nice about it and kind. \n\nCue pimple faced 16 year old red head kid. I do my thing, say my spiel and he looks at me all annoyed and bored and says “well, I’ll see what I can do”. \n\nI just look at him. Thoughts are swirling. Say what? \n\nSo I just watch him like a hawk and I’m glad I did because he tried to be an ass about it. A couple times he tried to put like a box of crackers from farther down on the belt with my cheese and I just say “that’s not cold. Please don’t put  that in there.” \n\nLooking back I should have said “why don’t we ask your manager if that is something you’re able or capable of doing” but I’m not that quick on my feet, especially when I had three kids that got me up 500 times a night. \n\nI shopped there often and did not see that kid after that. I have a feeling he didn’t last long. \n\nAnother time I made the request to an older woman when I only had about 15 items. I think I was busy with a kid when I hear her get all flustered. I look over and she’s trying to stuff all 7 of my large frozen items in one bag. \"They won’t all fit! I don’t know why you want me to do this!!!”  I had to hold back a laugh and gently say “oh you can use more than one bag, I just want like items together.”  She looked at me like I spoke another language. So I bagged my own groceries that day. \n\nOnce our store offered unlimited self check out stations I actually started using that to avoid any confusion or frustration. \n\nMy kids are all in school now so I can take my time when I get home with groceries so I just don’t care that much anymore. When I bag my own, tho, it’s frozen with frozen, cold with cold etc. I mean, that makes sense to me but maybe it’s not how people are trained. \n",

I hope you take advantage of those coupon before it expires. \n\nCustomer: But $10 in credit means I will still be paying more than I was originally. That would make the total $13.16 which is still more than the $9.89 I had originally purchased the item for. \n\n   Chat Rep.: You can apply this coupon on your order right away. \n\n   Chat Rep.: I request you to please help me with the coupon number. \n\n   Chat Rep.: So that I can apply it from my end. \n\nCustomer: coupon #***********2172 pin #**89 \n\n   Chat Rep.: Thank you. \n\nCustomer: You're welcome. \n\n   Chat Rep.: Customer, I have successfully applied the coupon on your order.

This express lane was empty. No one behind me. I always smile and say hello. He looks wound up and says hes trying to make it through the rest of the day. I say something kind back and try to be nice. I unload most of my items and the guy barks at me as I'm finishing \"14 and UNDER maam. \" I look up and make eye contact as I thought he might say either hed ring me up this time or can you go to the other lanes. Nope. Silence. He glares at me. He scared me enough he had me rattled- it was the unblinking stare and silence.\nSo I just said \"ok?\" , Shrugged and I put it all back in my cart. I expected a sarcastic remark or for him to go off on me. Or heck- even \"bye\". As I looked at him in a sad non angry way as I left to the next lane I half hoped he'd stop being so damned creepy. It made him more angry and huffy. Ive dealt with a lot of angry people in my line of work. People with history of assault. I don't rattle that easy. ",

        "text": "Hello hello. I am posting from mobile just an FYI. \n\nHere is my tale from a consignment video game store much like GameStop. \n\nA little background; In March I traded in a large amount of my electronics to a game store and thought I wouldn’t miss any of it. I was wrong (like usual) and later in September I was casually browsing online and in store for a 3DS system. \n\nI had also picked up a 2DS system at a thrift store for $13 a little after March. \n\nCome September, I am REALLY wanting a 3DS. My best friend had gotten ACNL for her system and had been talking about how much she wanted friends to play with her. The 2DS system’s screens are just too small to effectively play games. \n\nMy boyfriend and I head over to a local video game consignment store that also sells records. He’s wanting to see if they have a new album in stock. \n\nWhile walking by one of the glass gaming cases I notice that they have a 3DS XL (and the XL is important for later) and it’s only $50!!\n\nI went up to the counter and asked the cashier how much I would get in trade in value for my 2DS. They told me $25 in in-store credit. Awesome! I told my boyfriend when we left I was really interested and had wished I brought my 2DS with me. He mentioned he may go in later in the week to pick it up for me. \n\nAbout a week later my boyfriend surprises me with the 3DS system in a little gift bag. I open up the bag and find a..... DSi XL? \n\nFor any of you unfamiliar with Nintendo’s DS systems, the DSi is wayyyy out of date. My ACNL game won’t even fit into the game cartridge slot. \n\nI tell this to my boyfriend and he gets understandably upset. We decide to call the store tomorrow and explain the situation. \n\nI call them the next afternoon and explain what happened. They say they have the 2DS on a pawn shop hold and we can bring the DSi system in and just grab the 2DS back. Kind of disappointing but at the time I didn’t really think about it. \n\nMe and my boyfriend start talking about it and we realize that the tag on the DSi specifically said 3DS XL. I have worked retail with electronics for 3 years and know that the pricing and tagging policy is pretty cut and dry for everywhere. We discuss it and decide to tell the business tomorrow that it is fair that we receive what we believe we paid for: a 3DS XL. \n\nWe head into the store the next day and I let my boyfriend handle the situation. He explains that it is appropriate and fair for us to receive a 3DS XL for the same price we paid for. It isn’t right or fair for them not to honor their pricing or tagging. The manager on duty is visibly frustrated. \n\nThe manager goes into the back and calls the store manager. That manager apparently states the same thing: we get our 2DS given back to us or we pay the difference for the XL(priced at $120). My boyfriend refuses and the manager goes into the back again to call the store manager. The store manager gives the okay to have that manager have a regular 3DS from a different store given to us to fix the situation. The manager explains that we cannot have the current XL in the case because it’s a “different model” and says we need to be “better consumers” next time and make sure a deal isn’t too good to be true. \n\nWe left and accepted mainly because the situation was escalating and we aren’t the type to deal with that. \nWe sit down again and I point out that they won’t give us the XL they have because it’s a different model yet they are giving us a different model to fix the situation?? Didn’t really make sense to me. \n\nFrom my previous job, we had always been told to come the situation with either the same item or with a higher priced item. It is not the consumers fault for a mislabel or for not having the correct item sold to them. \n\nWe go to the store again and again I have my boyfriend handle the talking. \nI’m walking around the store and I hear the manager (same one we have been dealing with) call my boyfriend a jackass and ask him if he wants him to pull an XL out of his ass. \n\nI was shocked! My boyfriend had been so calm and professional. The manager stormed off and slammed the employee break room door. The store manager was at the register. \n\nI went up to the counter finally and said “Everything aside, what your employee just said and did was unacceptable and highly inappropriate” He agreed with me and apologized but seemed very apathetic. \n\nHe again said he would only give us the regular 3DS. I told him that was fine if he could explain to me why he is unable to give me the different model 3DS XL with the reason that it’s a different model from the one on the tag yet they are giving us a completely different type of 3DS. \n\nWithout another word he went over, grabbed the 3DS XL out of the glass case, rang it out of the system, and handed me a receipt. \n\nWe haven’t been back since!

        "text": "So this happened a while back, I’m also on my phone so I apologize for any formatting issues.  \n\nMy husband and I booked a hotel using a popular online site that allows you to name your own price.  We ended up not doing that, and choosing for their express deal instead.  This deal allows you to select the star level and area.  They name several similar hotels to this star level.  \n\nWe chose a 2.5 star hotel.  We arrived, and discovered the biggest shithole you can imagine.  Roaches on the walls, disgusting smells, dirty restroom, and all.  The front desk lady admitted to us that they are considered barely a 1 Star.  \n\nSince we specifically booked a 2.5 star hotel, and ended up in a disgusting 1 star, we called to complain.  We spent over an hour being bounced around without any luck.  Our whole argument was that this was advertised as a 2.5 star but was not, so we would like to be placed in an actual 2.5 star hotel in the area.  We got the run around and kept demanding the next level up supervisor.  They kept insisting that all they would do would be to cancel the reservation.  However, the catch is that they could not issue a refund because we had already been in the room an hour.  They didn’t care that the hour we were in there was spent on the phone with them.  Every person we spoke to was rude, and insisted that there was absolutely nothing they could do over the phone, and all of it must be done on their website.  (As in, they would cancel us but we would just have to start over on their website to find another hotel). \n\nBasically they would cancel our reservation, leave us out on the street at 10pm 3 hours from home, and not even attempt to find us a different hotel.  \n\nWe ended up calling the other online hotel company, who so graciously found us a 2.5 star in the area.  This was more than we originally paid, but at that point we had no other option.  They were wonderful.  \n\nIt took weeks of me calling and tweeting and emailing to finally get our refund.  They are by far the worst ever company to deal with.  We have had issues before with their customer service, but tried again due to the discounted rates.  Never again!! \n\nTL,DR:  online hotel company put us in a hotel far below advertised star rating, then refused to be any help whatsoever to fix it.  Other online hotel company was super nice and helpful.  ",

        "text": "Ordinarily I have a huge respect for call center agents as they have a very thankless and outright impossible job dealing with infuriating and entitled customers day in an day out. After this week, however, I have to carve out a caveat specifically for agents that answer calls for a hospital's billing department. I don't know why, but they insist on making the most simple of requests right near impossible to complete. \n\nOn top of that they, they come off as cold and miserable human beings. Where at other call centers most agents will at least attempt something that resembles human warmth, at the majority of hospital call centers I've had the misfortune to contact the agents don't even bother. \n\nSo I'm a patient advocate for a small clinic and I assist patients with issues regarding insurance specifically. There was a gentleman whose child had had her insurance turned off, but had been active during a the date of service of a recent trip to the hospital. For some reason, however, when he received the bill the invoice showed that the child was without insurance even though it had been active on the date of the service. \n\nEasy fix right? Just call the hospital and have them add the insurance to her account and bill the insurance. Or so you would think. So the patient and I call up the hospital billing department go through the normal verification and have the patient give the hospital permission to talk to me about his daughter's account. I give the hospital agent the insurance information. After 5-6 or six minutes of typing sounds he says that he cannot pull up the child's insurance information. He states that we must call the insurance company and request that they call them to confirm the child indeed did have active coverage on the date of service. \n\nIt just so happens I also have access to the insurance verification system. I tell the agent that I can send a print out or screenshot of the webpage showing the child did have active insurance on the date of service. \"No sir, the insurance company has to call us.\" the agent says snottily. I then ask if he can call the insurance company himself so we can have a conference call and get confirmation. \"No, you have to get them to call us because we can't be waiting on hold.\"\n\nSo the patient and I call his insurance company. I immediately ask that she call the  billing department at the hospital. After about 30 minutes of holding she tells us she's going to transfer us to their provider department so that they can call the billing department. 10 more minutes of waiting and now she comes on and says that they cannot call the billing department because they cannot place outbound calls. So a total of 40 minutes of waiting just for her to tell us they can't do jack shit. \n\nSo frustrated with this nonsense! Thank God it's Friday!",

There is no mistaking what I’m up to. \n\nAs I lay my items on the counter the cashier looks at me and asks how much I have in gas today. I blink, quite confused and cock my head to the side.  The cashier then asks me impatiently what pump I’m on and how much I have in gas. I reply that I’m not purchasing any gas... I’m on a bike. I point behind me to the bike leaning against the window outside. She looks at the bike, then me. Her face goes deadpan, she then sizes me up and asks me if I’m sure I don’t have gas today. \nI point to the pizza and snacks I’m trying to purchase and tell her that’s the closest thing to gas I’m getting today.  The cashier sighs, shifts her weight impatiently and tells me that gas theft is a crime and she will call the police.\n\nBy this point the people behind me in line are a mix of impatient and amused. I’m embarrassed and confused. How can she not see how incredible this whole thing is becoming? \n\nI pay for my purchases and tell her that I’m leaving. If she wants to call the cops for gas theft, she better write down my license plate just in case the security cameras missed it. I walked outside, put my stuff in my backpack, grabbed my bike and proceeded to give a single finger salute as I pedaled away. I really hope she did call the cops, I’d love to see their reaction to such blatant “theft”. \n\nEdit: I don’t actually have a license plate on my bike, I just figured it would show her I wasn’t stealing gas.

We live in a very small rural town that doesn't have very many food options.\nHusband had just got his promotion at work and as such he was getting off at 9pm. He decided that we would meet at local diner that is a southern chain of restaurants-not the well known always open during a disaster one. \nThere is literally nowhere to eat at 9:30pm in our town by the time he came home from the bigger town he works in. The waitress says take a seat. There's only one other family and they're not local. First off table is not clean. Second there was only one waitress working one cook and a manager. Got our order placed. That's when it all went down.\nWe see a squirrel run by us. The waitress then yells to the cook I got it trapped in the men's bathroom! Then she proceeds to capture it with her hands and take it outside. \nThen we got our food finally after 30 almost 40 minutes. No refills because they're out of tea. Both sweet for me and unsweetened for my husband. My mom in law is with us and so is my daughter. By that point we are fed up. Food tasted horrible but we just pushed through we were hungry.\nShe got a small tip my husband was being generous and we left with upset stomachs for the next day.\nNot less than 2 weeks later its officially closed due to health violations and other things. Franchise owner had been in trouble with not paying wages back in 2015 according to our local paper. This place used to be busy it's connected to a gas station right off the interstate so it was popular. So now we have no diner only fast food pizza chicken and Mexican. Nothing good unfortunately for late night hunger. But I did get to see a squirrel in a restaurant! ",

        "text": "So today I was out at the grocery store, grabbing a few drinks for the work fridge. I head to the express checkout line, which has a sign, clear as day, reading \"12 items or less.\" Having only three things I needed, I get in line.\n\nSo, I'm waiting for maybe a minute, when this gentleman, who we'll call Fuckface, comes up behind me. Now, Fuckface (hereafter FF) has a cart absolutely loaded sky high with stuff. The drinks in there alone would have put him well over the 12 item limit (especially since it looked like he just went to one of the little check out fridges with individual bottles and just looted it empty. Whatever, dude, its your money...). Seeing this guy's cart, I initiate conversation:\n\nMe: \"Excuse me, sir? This is the express checkout; 12 items or less. You should probably go to a different one.\"\n\nFF: \"Fuck off.\"\n\nWelp. That was it for me. By this point the cashier was scanning my stuff, and I just left to pay. While the dude begins unloading his cart, I whisper and mime a quick warning to the cashier, and begin gathering my stuff. The cashier turns, and, nice as can be, informs the customer that while she'll be happy to ring him out this time, this is the express lane and is usually reserved for customers checking out 12 items or less.\n\nAnd boy, was Fuckface not having it.\n\n\"I don't give a shit about that. You're going to ring me up because it's your JOB. I'm not moving just so some fat bitch can take it easy in the lazy bitch lane. Just think of it as you getting the workout you were OBVIOUSLY going to skip today.\"\n\nAnd that was when I left. Almost immediately, a guy I can only assume was a manager blew right past me, and about 10 seconds later I heard FF bellowing about how the cashier and \"even your other shitty little customers\" have been rude to him. I can only hope the dude got a swift kick in the ass. But, given my own experience in retail... I doubt it.  ",

        "text": "So, this is a story about another customer at *popular pet store chain*. Sorry for any formatting issues as I am on my phone.\n\nWe (my fiance and I)were at the pet store for I can't remember what (this was a few months ago) and we went to get in line but were met with a bit of confusion. There were at least 6 or 7 people just moshed together in front of the register. After a minute or two, it was clear that none of them were actually in line and were just waiting for someone from their group to be finished with their purchase. They were crowding around their (I assumed) new dog, but were directly behind the cashier's station, just far enough away to look like they were next. \n\nJust for some clarification, there is a sign that tells people where to line up. There is a set of shelves and  a tub of assorted dog biscuits, and you are supposed to go around the back of that and wait at the sign to be called.\n\nThere was an older couple in front of us, but not actually in line. I am fully aware that they are waiting for a cashier, but I'm quiet, and a bit of a push over so I don't say anything (even though I know I should have) and so my fiance ushers me along and we go stand where we are supposed to. The cashier calls us over (as I'm sure she is also aware that those people aren't standing where they should) and starts ringing us up. The older people (I say older because they weren't quite elderly yet-60s probably) finally figure out where to stand after a lot of disgruntled arguing between each other. \n\nAs we are being serviced, the entire time, the man is just whining. \"But we were in line first.\" No you weren't. \"It's not fair.\" Blah blah blah, all that good stuff. Truth be told, I felt kind of bad, but it wasn't my fault that you couldn't figure it out for yourself. There were signs. Now, I know that it was pretty easy for me to keep my composure, but my fiance on the other hand is very.... assertive. I thought maybe he couldn't hear the guy because he didn't say a word. But, when we got to the car, he just started laughing.\n\nI don't know what happened afterwords. I assume he gave the cashier grief over helping the person actually standing in line. But it was just funny how much of a child he was acting over something like that.",

        "text": "So, this story is going back a bit. In March 2007, the new Adam Smith £20 note was released, replacing the old Edward Elgar one. Everyone who paid attention knew about it, it was on the news, etc etc. I got mine out of the cashpoint that morning and it was so new it gave me a paper cut, haha. \n\nI'd just been paid, so decided to take a trip to London with a few friends. After walking around for a while, we went to a indie-style record shop chain in Camden Town that used to have a few branches in London back then, but now only has a couple. \n\nI went inside and picked up a CD. I brought it to the counter, presented my new note and the tall skinny bloke on the till stared down his nose at me and said \"What. Is. This.\" as if I'd just upended a bucket of dog turds on to the counter. \n\n\"Oh!\" I said, eager to clear up any confusion. \"It's the new note. Came out today.\"\n\n\"There is no new note. I'm not taking this\" he sniffs at me. \n\nI look round at my friends who look similarly confused. \"Are you winding me up?\" I say. \"It came out today! Been on the news and everything.\" \n\n\"If that were true I would have heard something. Why would they bring out a new note? I don't want it in my till. Pay with some proper money or leave the queue, please\" \n\nI can't believe this is happening. I squint at  this proto-hipster for a resemblance to Jeremy Beadle, but there's no beard and anyway, he's too tall. I lose my temper. \"Look, I dunno mate. I'm not the Bank Of England, am I? This is the new note and that's all there is to it. Can you get your manager?\"\n\n\nHe looks at me like I've made the most unreasonable request of all time and refuses. I stomped upstairs to find his manager. She comes down and pleads with him to take the note. He won't. He \"doesn't want it in his till\", presumably it'll infect the other money and cause that to not exist, too. I don't know. The manager apologises profusely and serves me upstairs. The guy must have felt like such an idiot a few days later when every other person was paying for purchases with them. \n\nNeedless to say, I've never been back since. I buy my music from the store with the dog on the front now.",

I would only buy from them and I've spent thousands there (I checked on my rewards app). \n\nUp until 2 weeks ago there were people working there that had the best customer service. I had previously rated them 5 stars. They quit and opened their own shop so naturally I started frequenting theirs more. I dropped my review down to 3 stars (still not a bad review). \n\nI went by the old shop today and the owner told me I was banned because of my review. I figured \"oh well guess I'll just go to the new one from now on\". The owner then texted one of the guys that quit to stop sending spies to his shop. He called a few of the customers racial slurs. I'm just very unhappy about this experience and needed to vent.\n\nEdit for clarity: I went to the shop after the two employees quit. I edited my review to explain why I dropped it. The owner was not in that day. When I went to speak with him about it, he banned me on the spot for the review. I have since changed everything to a one star stating I was banned for the review. This was on Google Maps and Facebook so more people would be able to view it, and so the review didnt get taken down (like Yelp likes to do). I'm not begging for his patronage, as there are multiple vape shops in the city. I was just very upset and reeling because of the amount of money, and time, that I've spent there through the past couple of years.",

        "text": "First off, I’d like to say that I work in customer service, so I know how it can be. But this woman was so over the top.\n\nMy mom and I were doing Christmas shopping today, and we thought we’d get the dogs some new dog tags since they already have like 50 toys each (they’re still getting SOME toys, but they don’t need 8 brand new toys each). So, where better else to go than PetWorld, that one particular Canadian store that wears khaki safari uniforms?\n\nWe approached the counter with the tags and started perusing the various shapes, sizes, and colours. We settled on two small red bones, and then as we were about to flag down an employee to do the engraving, one walked over and asked if we needed anything.\n\nWe explained that we were getting tags for two dogs, one who lives with us in Canada and one who lives with my sister and BIL in the US. We showed her the two we picked, and the following conversation happened. I’ll be me, my mom will be mom, and the rude girl will be RG. Dog names are cut down to 1st letter.\n\nMom: we’d like these two tags engraved please.\n\nRG: *looks at the tags* for dogs or cats? (Why would we have picked bones for cats?)\n\nMe: dogs.\n\nRG: what kind?\n\nMom: they’re both shih tzus.\n\nRG: are you SURE you want the small bones?\n\nMe: yes, that’s what they both have now and they’re just fine.\n\nRG: are you SURE? They’re tiny.\n\nMom: yes, we’re sure.\n\nRG: *in that sing-songy “you’re gonna regret it” voice* okay then...\n\nRG: what font?\n\nMom: *looks at me* they both have Script now, right?\n\nMe: yeah, B does but I’m not sure about L. I think so though.\n\nRG: are you SURE? It comes out really messy and hard to read.\n\nMom: well, what else is there?\n\nRG: I recommend this one.\n\nMom: fine, we’ll go with that for B’s, but my daughter still likes Script for L’s.\n\nRG: ...are you SURE?\n\nI wanted to ask if she was SURE she wanted to make the sale and get the commission from the rest of our large purchase (various other toys and treats).\n\nThis particular location of this particular store is like that a lot. When we first got B 2.5 years ago, our last dog H (also a shih tzu) had just passed away and had been on a certain type of food for years that worked really well for her, so we thought we’d start there. H had also had a grain allergy, and we were told by her vet that it was common in shih tzus so we wanted to avoid grains. We were standing in the aisle looking over the ingredients of the foods, and we were torn between small breed puppy (for the smaller pieces) and large breed puppy (for the ingredients). I went up to the counter to inquire and this conversation happened. This time RW will be rude woman (as she was significantly older than today’s girl).\n\nMe: excuse me, I have a question about the Now brand of dog food. Can you help me?\n\nRW: what’s your question?\n\nMe: well, we’re getting a 9-week-old shih tzu tomorrow, and since you’re closed for Good Friday we’re trying to get everything we need now. We’re trying to decide between the small breed puppy and the regular puppy foods, because the small breed pieces are smaller but the ingredients in the regular one are more desirable to us. Can you tell me if there’s actually a big difference between the size of the pieces?\n\nRW: what do you mean?\n\nMe: like, could a shih tzu puppy manage the bigger ones or is it not advised? We obviously don’t want to get something she won’t be able to eat because we won’t be able to replace it until Saturday, and we don’t want her to go hungry her first night with us. And we also don’t want her to choke trying to swallow something that’s too big.\n\nRW: I don’t usually recommend that brand at all.\n\nMe: well, my mom is over by the dog food. Would you mind coming to give us some recommendations or sending someone over who can help?\n\nRW proceeded to walk over to the shelf, where my mom was, and tell us that Now is a terrible brand, and that we absolutely shouldn’t buy it. This was shocking since it was recommended by our vet, but whatever. We asked for her recommendation. She pointed out one in which the main ingredient was salmon, and another that we knew for a fact was garbage (and which was sold in grocery stores for half the price?). I did a quick google search on my phone and saw that shih tzus didn’t tend to like salmon because it’s such a strong smell.\n\nMe: are you sure? This website says shih tzus don’t tend to like salmon.\n\nRW: you can’t believe everything you read online. I assure you, I’ve never seen a bag of this come back.\n\nMom: well, if you’re sure...\n\nRW: I am.\n\nSo we bought the food, a crate and bed, a couple of new toys (just so that she had some that didn’t smell like another dog, as she also got all of H’s toys), and some puppy pads (we had everything else...the only reason we needed a crate was because we gave H’s to L a couple years prior because she hadn’t used it in years), then went home.\n\nThe next morning we got up nice and early and drove 3 hours away to pick up the puppy. She came with about 2 cups of her old food (for transitioning purchases) and a collar. When we got home she settled right in, and my sister and BIL came with L to visit that night to meet the new puppy (and it was Easter). The kicker? They forgot her food!\n\nThat’s okay, though, right? Because we had a brand new bag. Right away we opened it up because L was getting hungry and B already was. It smelled awful but we figured the dogs would probably like it anyway. We poured some into a bowl, mixed in some from the little bag we got with B, and...B refused it. Uh oh. So we tried to feed it to L. L refused it too.\n\nWe then had to share the tiny bag between the two dogs until the next morning. My BIL went over to PetIntelligence the next day and got the food their dog eats, as well as the puppy version for B. Luckily everything turned out fine, but B developed a bad issue with food where she feels the need to eat everything at lightning speeds. I wonder if it’s related?",

You growing an immunity to their tantrums only magnifies how inept you are as a parent.

However, the shit I'm taking about is when it's gone beyond that, and even other kids are like NOPE, that will not be me. \n\n\nI ran into the Wally World next door to my job tonight to grab some cranberry juice.\n\nBefore I could enter the doors good, I could hear the deep throated wail/ scream (Scrail) of a child that initially sounded in distress. The kind that will make your throat scratchy, dry and painful. \n\nThe kind of scrail that instantly hits you like nails on a chalkboard. Honestly, for a moment I truly thought he was scrailing for legitimate help; my beacons went up and I looked to find where this terrified child was. Turns out, he was just an awful, overly spoiled child wanting candy. (About 4-5 yrs)\n\nIn the three minutes or so it took to locate my juice and get to the self checkout, this child had EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. I passed commenting on this child and his \"mother\". I passed the checkout isle they were in and stopped [I've found that if I can make eye  contact behind parents back, the Evil Eye will SThemTFU]\nThis little demon was making eye contact and fully aware of the negativity around him. He only paused long enough to swallow, which everyone could see was very  difficult for him, given the way he was Scrailing.\n\n Mama? Sheeiiiit......You woulda thought she was alone. She showed no awareness of the scrailing child in the cart, 1 foot front her ear, that could be heard in heaven and hell alike. \n\n The managers in this store failed. I'm a retail manager. In my place of work, I will unabashedly ask you to control your child(ren). If I were in the store and not on company time,  I WOULD'VE ABSOLUTELY approached this un- mom and given her my whole mind and spoken strongly to the demon directly. \n\nI know there are many different approaches to parenting;, but I think we all can agree that if your child is disruptive to the point of disrupting an entire big box business, it's time to hone them in\n\n",

( I could have argued AGAIN that all I wanted was that big mirror 10 feet away but decide since she took my cart I’d just go in the first room real quick so I’d have somewhere to hang my jackets. It was handicap accessible but I was only going to be like 3 mins or less so no biggie.)\nAs I walked in it she retorts rudely  “ sure, go ahead. Use ‘that’room” \n\nI just ignore her. \n\nThe whole experience is just odd. She was odd and did not communicate well and was snippy. Why do people with such terrible people skills gravitate to jobs with people?? \n\nWhen I came out she was gone. I have a feeling a nearby manager saw the whole thing and replaced her. \n\nThe entire experience weirded me out. \n\n",

        "text": "Originally tried to post this at r/TIFU but since nothing bad happened directly to me, I thought it would be better here. I guess I am now one of those awful customers that we hear so much about.\n\nSo this FU really began last Christmas but was brought to a head today. My parents got me an electric razor as a present. Previously I had always used manual razors so I did not really know how to use an electric razor. As a guy, however, I refused to read the directions - I would much rather learn from trial and error than by wasting time reading directions.\n\nAt first the razor was great. I would get a nice, close shave on my face and a little bit of hair would just fall into the sink which I would wash away. So far so good.\n\nAfter a few months the razor stopped working well. It would miss a lot of spots, not give me a close shave, just overall not working as well as when I first got it. It was still in warranty so I drove back to a \"Bullseye\" (where my parents got the razor) and tried to do an exchange.\n\nI explained what was happening to the customer service desk and asked for an exchange or a return. The employee grabbed the razor to look it over and **popped open the compartment that collects the shaved hair**. I did not even know that there was a collection area that I was supposed to clean. Since Christmas my hair had been filling the compartment with small bits of hair and it was now overflowing. It was so full that some of the hair shot onto the employee. Giant clumps of short, wet pieces of my facial hair got all over the employee's shirt, arm, and the return counter at Bullseye.\n\nThe employee took a step back and then ran to the bathroom, covering her mouth. I didn't even realize that I was supposed to clean the razor. Honestly I don't know what I thought happened to the hair, I guess I thought the little bit fell into the sink was it and the rest just disappeared or something. It really never even popped into my mind.\n\nEveryone nearby just stared at me as the employee ran away and I just yelled *Sorry!* and booked it. I will probably never return there because that was absolutely disgusting and I am way too embarrased.\n\n**Tl;dr** I didn't know that my electric razor had a compartment full of hair that I was supposed to clean out, went to Target to return it and the employee launched almost a year's worth of my wet clumpy facial hair all over herself and the return counter.",

Whats your favourite or best recommendations?\n\nHim: hmm im not sure because everything is amazing here.

Ill let u look at the menu a bit longer.\n\nAnd off he goes...\n\n\nNot sure how thats helpful if i cant read the menu... i just end up googling some of the items and ordering them when he came back. \n\nI noticed/overheard him explaining the menu items in detail and being super friendly to the tables next to us after we order. Which was a piss off because we hardly saw him...thank god they had other staff pouring water and removing dishes because i saw him 3 times the whole dinner.\n\nNote: ive been here before and when i ask for recommendations they usually just point out 3-4 dishes and explain what they are.",

        "text": "Relevant background: Minnesota has two options for drivers licenses, a regular ‘ole one and an enhanced drivers license. The enhanced license is eventually going to replace the regular licenses because they don’t meet federal quotas for flying or something. \n\nOn to the story- I went to a restaurant with my friend and ordered a glass of a certain wine. The waitress ID’s me and I hand her my enhanced license. She asks “what’s this?” obviously leaning towards its a fake. I’m used to this as no restaurant in Minnesota knows what an enhanced license is even though they have been out for a year or two now. \n\nI explain that I can drive to Canada and Mexico with it, it kinda acts as a land passport (can’t fly to Canada or Mexico with this though) and it takes more verification than a regular license or even a passport. \n\nWaitress goes “uh huh”, hands me my card and runs off. I know she is getting her manager and her manager comes over and asks for my card. I hand it to him, no problem it happens all the time. Usually the manager recognizes the enhanced license and no problem. \n\nManager walks away with my card and I see a group of workers hovering over my card in the back. They all give me a weird look and the manager goes to the kitchen. \n\nNot even five minutes later a freaking mall cop shows up in the middle of the restaurant (at a mall) and I see him take the card look at it for five seconds, roll his eyes, and walk over and he personally hands me my card without saying anything and walks away. \n\nManager slinks over and profusely apologizes to me and is now in kiss-ass mode. He offers a free appetizer for my troubles, my friend orders the most expensive thing on the appetizer menu which was $27 sushi, milking the situation for all it’s worth. \n\nWaitress comes back apologizing but I’m over the situation at this point. We reorder our drinks and order our food after waiting for 20 minutes at this point. \n\nTen minutes later waitress comes back and says they ran out of said wine I wanted. I said “ok I’ll just stick with my water then”. The waitress’s face went white and she wasn’t so nice after that. ",

I go to the bank, find a parking spot, pay for parking, stand in line, and finally get to the teller, who was a younger looking Asian guy. Probably late 20s.

Can I see your phone?\n\nAt this point his manager, M, comes over. \n\nM: what seems to be the problem?\nMe: hi there. I came in to deposit this cheque and withdraw some cash and he won't let me. \nT: no, I was just trying to explain to her how to deposit cheques with her smartphone. \nMe: I know how to deposit cheques with my smartphone, but I can only access $250 for 5 days when I do that and I need more than $250. \nM: well how about we adjust the settings on your account so that you can access $500?\nMe: No. You aren't listening to me. I would like him to deposit this cheque and withdraw some cash for me. That is what I came in for today. Could you please do that for me?\nM &amp; T: *cant hear me because they're too busy adjusting my account* \nM: alright all done!

Ever. I have worked retail and the service industry, I know how it feels to get yelled at.

He thought it was the battery, so he got a friend to come and jump start it and then follow him to the nearest car part place. He didn’t even make it there before it died again, but another jump got him the rest of the way to the store.\n\nIt was almost closing time, but the workers stepped up! They tested his battery, and told him it was probably the alternator. He called me and we decided that I wasn’t really able to pick him up because the kids were asleep (and all the car seats were in the van) and he needed to get the van towed to our regular car repair place anyway ASAP, since I was pregnant and needed access to the van while he was at work for doctors visits and such.\n\nSo he called our insurance company to get a tow truck sent (we have towing coverage but it has to be done through them) and it was going to be 45 minutes or so. It was winter and cold, and his cell phone was getting really low, so he was worried. He figured he would have to walk to the grocery store and wait for the tow truck, which was complicated by the fact that he wouldn’t be able to see the van.\n\nBut then the car repair guys really showed their colors. They closed the store, but stuck around, let him stay there in the warmth until the tow truck arrived, and even provided a charger for his phone so it didn’t die. He was totally blown away, they stayed way past closing to help him out.\n\nHe got their names and called their manager and the corporate number the next day to tell them how awesome they were (being careful not to mention anything that might get them in trouble.) We never found out, but I hope they were rewarded.",

Just before he left I added, \"Have a happy Halloween!\" but being focused on restarting the engine he may or may not have heard me.\n\nIt's a good thing to know that I made someone's evening so good that they said \"Oh Sh%#!\" on the job.\n\nDo any of you have stories from Halloweens past or present?

There are 14 windows for which we want to buy cellular shades.\n\nFirst stop is a custom blinds place which, of course, turns out to be way more expensive than we want.  So off to the big box home improvement store we go.\n\nWe find our way to the window treatment department, look through the books, find what we want and then ask a nearby employee if someone could assist us.  He says he'll get someone.  After waiting for 10 minutes we go ahead and press the button on the desk for assistance.  After another 10 minutes, we leave because no one is coming to help us.\n\nOff to the other big box home improvement store.  Once again, we find what we want and approach the service desk.  There are 6 employees at this desk and no customers.  Still, it takes one of the 6 employees a couple of minutes of looking at us holding the big blind sample book to ask us if we need help.\n\nWe sit down and I give him a size to see what the cost is in order to compare it to the cost at the custom blind place.  The prices are good and there's a sale.  Great!  I tell the employee working with us that we need installation and ask how much that will be.  He says the price just changed so he starts asking the other 5 people how much it is.  They don't know.  He can't find the paper with it on there.  I tell him to just ball park it for me.  He says under $200 for as many blinds as we want installed.  There's a $50 measurement fee, but that comes off the installation price. Great!\n\nSo I give him a couple of more sizes and he gives me the prices including the sale discount.  We decide to buy these blinds.  Based on the estimates, I'm looking at a total of $2000-$2500.\n\nSo I tell him we are ready to buy.  He tells us we can't buy today because they have to measure first.  I tell him that's fine as long as we still get the sale price.\n\nNope.  We will not be getting the sale price because they have to measure first, but he's sure there will be another sale soon.\n\nNow I'm confused.  He just spent 15-20 minutes discussing the cost of the sizes we need and the installation and not once has he mentioned we can't have the sale price.  So I ask him how long their sales usually last.  He says a week to a week and a half.\n\nI then ask him how long it usually takes to get a measurement appointment.  He says usually a week to a week and a half.\n\nSo it appears as long as you come in on the first day of the sale you can get the sale price.  Otherwise you are out of luck.\n\nWe leave his desk and go to customer service because this just can't be right.  It's just too bait and switchy.\n\nThere is one customer being helped at the customer service desk.  We wait about 10 minutes for them to be done, but they aren't  so we leave.\n\nFrom home, I call the store and ask for a manager.  The first person I talk to asks me to explain the problem and then she'll get a manager.  I tell her what happened and her response is that the associate should have gotten a manager to see if we could still get the sale price.  Then she transfers me.  The second person, who I assume is a manager, doesn't listen to my whole explanation and just starts cutting me off saying that yes, that's how it works, but that she'll give me the sale price if I schedule a measurement right now.\n\nGreat!  She says she'll call me back once she's scheduled the measurement appointment.  Instead, the guy I was working with when I was in the store calls me back.  He takes my info and credit card number, then says I'll be receiving a call to actually schedule the measurement appointment once the credit card charge goes through in 24 to 48 hours.\n\nHonestly, I really wanted to say just forget it, but the sale price is better than I've been able to find online, so I tell him that's great and thank him.\n\nI can't wait to see how the rest of this goes.",

I called and the store was happy to let me return it. I brought the mattress and was loading up the new one when I saw that they were getting ready to destroy the old one. I offered to buy it off them instead. The guy said he’d let me for $700. I originally paid $900. I offered $400 and this guy said “no.” And then sliced the mattress to pieces right in front of me. It was just bizarre and kind of sad. ",

When I came in I greeted the employee and took a look at the baked goods they offered while she was busy serving someone else. I noticed they had individually wrapped pieces of cake for sale. \n\nTo me, it looked like it was either carrot, butter or lemon cake but because I have a visual impairment, I'm blind in one eye, and the room wasn't well lit I didn't know for sure. Since I hate lemon cake with a passion I decided to ask the employee what kind of cake it was. Her response was: \"Carrot cake. You would've known that if you looked at it. Open your eyes next time!\" \n\nHer sudden rude tone was a surprise to me and so I apologized: \"Sorry. I have a vision impairment so I couldn't see it properly... I'd like one of those then.\" She raised her eyebrows and replied: \"So what? That's not my problem, is it?\" She took my money and threw the cake on the counter. Then she left to the back room without another word.\n\nThat wasn't the first time I had issues with this bakery, they frequently serve any customers before me no matter where I stand in line and there have been condescending and rude remarks towards me. It's probably because I look rather young (I refuse to believe that it's because I'm disabled/overweight) but I make an effort to be polite and respectful to retail workers and the employees of this bakery just treat me like crap in return. \n\nThe worst thing is that it's not a chain bakery, it's privately owned and the owner is just as rude as the employees so I can't even complain. And they're the only bakery that's anywhere close to me! It's like they know that they can be rude to me without any consequences and that's why they do it. ",

Not that bad considering they are busy. However, there is this woman. looks about 50 in a sedan, with one of those giant mom purses. She comes driving in about 15 minutes ago and almost pulls up to the line of cars, parks and walks away from her car. Now to really understand the stupidity, you have to know that there are about 10 different signs in a range of sizes and placements that clearly say you need to wait in your car until an attendednt checks you in. In fact she almost hit one of the signs pulling into the drive. Anyway, out comes an attendant and sees her walking away from her car, asks her to get back in and wait until they can attend to her. She straight up explodes at this kid. Saying how it needs to be more clear and how dare he expect her to sit in her car when it's a hot day, you know just like the other 6 people in line. Thankfully her tantrum was short she stomps over and gets back into her car and pouts. Then the person getting their oil changed is done and pulls away. everyone starts up their cars to move forward. and this lady decides she is next and speeds up and squeezes the nose of her car in front of the person next in line. The attendents did not care. She has now gotten her oil changed and driven away. And here I am still waiting, in the sun, without ac. apparently like a fool. ",

At checkout the cashier has to offer you the deal of the week before you pay.  If the cashier doesn’t offer it to you, you get that item for free.\n\nSo one Saturday I was doing the grocery shopping and there was a lady in her 40s with “the haircut” in line in front of me (hereafter called “haircut lady”).  She had two items, shampoo and deodorant.  She asked the young female cashier to run them through on two separate transactions.  I had emptied my rounding-full cart onto the belt already and was watching this unfold.  \n\nFirst the shampoo.  The cashier asks if haircut lady wants the deal of the week.  The haircut lady says “no”.  Okay, next it’s time to pay for the deodorant.  The cashier simply gives her the total.  Once the lady has paid for the second item (with the *same* card, mind you), haircut lady says “now I get the deal of the week for free”.  \n\nThe cashier’s face drops, and she says “but I asked you the first time”.  Without hesitation the haircut lady says “no, you need to ask me every time”.  The cashier begins “but I already…” The haircut lady cuts her off, by simply saying “manager”, taking a step back, folding her arms and letting her bitch-face rest.  The cashier looked terrified, like she would get in trouble or something (she was pretty young).\n\nSo a manager is called, and eventually arrives.  The situation was explained, eyes were rolled in secret and the haircut lady was given her free item.  A fucking 89 cent toothbrush.\n\nShe waddles away gleefully, having caused 10-15 minutes delay to everyone in line.  \n\nI step up to the cashier (who was red-faced and flustered) to begin my transaction and I say “yes, I’d like all of these on separate transactions please, and you better ask me every time if I want the toothbrush” (I had about 150 items).  We both had a bit of a laugh.",

Very short.  I'm 5'2\", and I was staring down at her, so she must have been around 4'7\".   Wearing jeans and a demin shirt of the same hue)\n\nT: Teller (female, mid 20's, light brown hair in a ponytail, glasses, looked like your average bank teller.)\n\nOC: Other Customer (female, mid 40's, wearing a uniform from a local gas station/convenience store chain.)\n\nMe: (Me!)\n\nOnto the story:\n\nThis afternoon, I had to actually go inside the bank because I needed to withdraw cash in bills smaller than $20. While I was at the little desk filling out a withdrawal slip, I overheard the following conversation between a customer and a teller.\n\nSL: \"I saw this spider earlier, it was brown and about this size [I assume she made a gesture to indicate the size].  Can it hurt me?\"\n\nT: \"Uhhhh, I'm not sure.  Was it a wolf spider?\"\n\nSL: \"I don't know.\"\n\nAt this point I had gotten behind Spider Lady in line.  Since she was in the middle of her transaction, and I had nothing better to do, I pulled up a picture of a Wolf Spider on my phone to show her. If you don't know what a Wolf Spider looks like, they are light brown with 2 darker brown stripes on their back, and quite large, up to 2-3\" or so in diameter, legs included. They are very common where I live and look scary due to their size, but they are harmless.\n\nMe, holding up my phone, to SL: \"Excuse me, is this what it looked like?\"\n\nSL, decisively: \"No. It was smaller. About this size.\" She made a circle about the size of a quarter with her thumb and index finger and continued, \"It had a small head but a larger and round body,\" and she turned back to the teller.\n\nI then pulled up a picture of a Brown Recluse spider, whose venom is poisonous, as those and Wolf Spiders are the only brown spiders that I know by name.\n\nMe, once again holding up my phone to SL, who had turned back around to face me: \"Did it look like this?\"\n\nSL, squinting and studying the picture: \"Maybe.  It looked kinda like that.\"\n\nMe: \"That's a Brown Recluse. They are poisonous.  Where was it?\"\n\nSL: \"In our RV park.\"\n\nMe: \"No, *where*?\"\n\nSL starts giving me the address of the RV park.\n\nMe, trying to figure out how to better explain what I meant by \"where\": \"No, ***where***?\"\n\nSL: \"Oh, it was in my car.\"\n\nMe: \"Well, then it probably wasn't a brown recluse.  They like to live in wood piles and other dark and damp spaces. Brown Recluses and Black Widows are the only dangerous spiders in this area, so you don't need to worry too much.\" \n\nSL: \"Great. Now I have one in my car!  I think I got it earlier, but I'm not sure, it could still be in there.  This is just great. Why does it have to be in my car? What if I see it again while I'm driving?\" She continued on in this vein for a few more seconds. \n\nMe: *Shrug*\n\nSL walks out, still muttering about the spider in her car. \n\nI turn to the teller to start my transaction and say, in an obviously sarcastic voice: \"Um, I just saw this spider, and it was brown. Is it dangerous?\"\n\nTeller smiled and laughed a bit, but probably felt that it would be unprofessional to react more effusively. \n\nAt this point OC joined in the commiseration over Spider Lady.\n\nOC, with a hint of exasperation: \"Really.  Brown spider.\"\n\nMe: \"It's like, 'You know that movie with that guy that came out last year?'\"\n\nOC: \"I do know that movie!\"\n\nAnd then my transaction was finished and I left. \n\nI'm still trying to figure out how Spider Lady thought a bank teller would be able to tell her if a spider was poisonous, without seeing it, and with no other information other than it was brown and about the size of a quarter.\n\n\n*Edited because proofreading is hard.*\n\n\n  \n\n",

I also make an effort to be friendly, engaged, and treat servers like they are human beings. (I know, shocking!) \n\nSo at restaurants that I go to often, the servers tend to remember me. I've had some really fantastic servers who have been friendly, professional, and awesome. \n\nSadly, this isn't one of those stories. \n\nI was eating by myself at a chain Italian place that I frequent a couple times a month. \n\nMy waitress is one who has never served me before. But a couple of the servers who regularly see me have dropped by to say \"hi\" as they head to their sections. \n\nI'm enjoying my chicken alfredo. I have about 6 bites left of the whole thing and suddenly my fork pulls a long strip of paper out of the dish. I had thought it was a noodle. But nope. It's a long, blank strip of paper. \n\nImmediately I know how this is going to look. I'm almost finished eating my meal and suddenly find something in it. So I consider not saying anything. But I'm a little worried about how this paper got into my food in the first place. \n\nSo I flag down my server and say \"Hey. I found this strip of paper in my food. Could you let the kitchen know so they can make sure it doesn't happen to anyone else?\" \n\nThe server looks at me, looks at my plate, rolls her eyes and says \"Ma'am, you've eaten almost your entire meal. I can't comp your food.\" \n\nI reply and say \"I'm not asking for my food to be comp'd. I agree. I've eaten almost the whole thing. But I just found this strip of paper in here. I want you to let the kitchen know so they can figure out where it came from so no one else has this problem.\" \n\nThe server sighs and says \"Ma'am, you can talk to my manager if you want. But we won't be able to comp a meal you've eaten.\" \n\nI say \"I understand. I fully plan on paying for my meal. I don't want anything comp'd. All I want is for you to let the kitchen know about the paper in my food so it doesn't happen to anyone else.\" \n\nThe server huffs \"Fine! I'll go get my manager for you!\" and she stomps off. \n\nTwo minutes later some comes stomping back over with the manager. \n\nThe manager says \"My server tells me you're unhappy with your food and want to have it taken off the bill.\" \n\nI say \"No. That's not it at all. I specifically told her twice that I do NOT want the meal comp'd because I've eaten most of it. I found this strip of paper in my food and I asked her to let the kitchen know so they can make sure no one else has the same issue.\" \n\nI point out the strip of paper that I've laid on the edge of my plate away from the 6 bites of food I didn't finish.\n\nThe manager says \"Oh! I'm so sorry. I know what happened here. We precook the pasta and lay it out on baking trays lined with parchment paper. Then when an order comes in, the cook grabs the pasta with tongs and drops it into the boiling water to bring it back up to temperature before plating it. The cook must have grabbed the edge of the parchment paper and torn it when he picked up the noodles. I'm so sorry.\" \n\nNow that I know it's just parchment paper, I'm feeling a lot better about the whole thing. So I say \"Oh. That makes sense. Thank you so much.\" \n\nThen the manager says \"Since you've eaten most of your entree, we can't comp it. But I'd be happy to have them make another one or give you a free dessert.\" \n\nI reply \"Not necessary. Please just go ahead and bring me the bill. I'm happy to pay for the chicken alfredo.\" \n\nThe manager and server leave. \n\nThe server comes stomping back over. She says \"Here you go\" and slams the receipt book on the table. \"The manager went ahead and comp'd your meal since you made such a big deal about it.\" \n\nI open the book and sure enough the receipt is just for my iced tea. \n\nI take out a $10 and slip it in the book and hand it to the server saying \"No change needed. Thank you.\" \n\nI really, really, REALLY, would have been happy to pay for my meal. I ate it. I'm happy to pay for it. \n\nWhat I'm not happy about is having a server treat me like I'm trying to scam the restaurant when I repeatedly tell her I don't want my meal comp'd. ",

        "text": "Okay, so, normally I judge this sub pretty harshly, but I finally had an experience worthy of it. \n\nSo, we went out for a friend's birthday party to a local bar that serves food. It was still early, so the place was pretty empty. There are 6 of us, find a big enough table, sit and wait. A super nice server comes by, gets us our drinks, and leaves. We never see her again, so I'm assuming her shift ended. Perfectly fine with me. The girl that replaced her, though, gave us the worst service I've ever had in my life.\n\nShe showed up to get us the next round of drinks, but would only take orders two at a time. She would take two orders, go get the drinks, come back, take two orders, repeat. I've never seen anyone do that before. She manages to bring one friend jack on the rocks when he clearly asked for a jack and soda. Instead of correcting it, she just tells him she will get him jack and soda next time. She then leaves for about 30 minutes.\n\nFinally, she comes around for food. We tell her that we are going to be three separate checks. Three couples, three checks. We apologize for not telling her before the drink orders. We tell her which drinks go with which couple. Okay, cool. That shouldn't be a problem. She takes the food orders - all at once this time- and we ask for a shot of tequila for friend whose birthday it was. She leaves. \n\nWe don't see her or the food for 45 minutes. Yes, we do count on spending a few hours here, but we'd like to drink and eat within those few hours. She brings the food....half  of it is in to go boxes, half on real plates. When we seem confused, she tells us we told her that a few of us were leaving. None of us can remember saying anything even remotely close to that. She forgot about my friend's birthday tequila shot -even though I watched her write it down-, so we remind her. I try to get another glass of wine. She says okay, walks away. Doesn't come back for 20 minutes.\n\nAfter she brings the wine, we see that she forgot the shot again. Like seriously? It's a shot. For someone's birthday. It's not hard to remember. She takes off again, and we just don't see her. We end up going to the bar ourselves for the rest of the night (the actual bartender is in another section that is separate from where they serve food. Think of how a TGIChilBees has the separate bar area). Even the bartender was confused as to why we were doing this, and not the server. \n\nFinally, she comes around with the check. One check. Not the three we asked for. We mention that we needed it split. She disappears again. She comes back ten minutes later, still with one check. She puts the check and a pen down and tells us to mark off what each of us had. She then just walks away. Like....are you kidding me? You can't do this super simple thing? Fine, whatever. Everyone marks off what they had using 1, 2, or 3. She takes that check. Ten more freaking minutes go by, and she brings back three checks. Half of them are mixed up still. We say screw it, pay anyway. Not worth it. \n\nTogether, our tab was $250.00. She got maybe $20 off the table. Usually, I tip at strictly 20% or more, but I didn't even feel the tiniest bit guilty about her low tip. ",

Gives me back my change and thrusts a bag at me. No ‘ thank you’ , no ‘ Have a nice day’. Nothing.

I pull up to the window, pay and receive the donut. So far things aren't remarkable in any way. Just an average drive thru experience.\n\nBut then DancingGirl happened. DancingGirl is a 20-ish server who apparently had been tasked with making the latte. She danced her way from around an out of sight latte machine, increasing the range of movement with every step. Latte foam and coffee are flying out of the lid. Two co-workers are staring at her like she's grown a second head. She bows to me, kisses the lid of the latte, says \"here you are m'lady\" while thrusting the drink at me. \n\nAfter picking my jaw off the floor of my car I say no thanks and request a new one. DancingGirl asks why? I tell her because she licked it and sprayed a large amount of it around during her dance (could see it on her uniform, the wall). She says she'll make me one that's even better. I say okay but no dancing and no licking the coffee. She says she has to or I won't know she cares. Tired and frustrated by her weirdness and the lack of give-a-crap displayed by her co-workers, i drove off.\n\nAbout an hour later I sent a customer experience survey and requested that the store owner call me. Three days later I get the call. Apparently DancingGirl is special needs. I describe my experience and ask why DancingGirl has progressed to interacting with the public if she doesn't understand and can't follow basic health and safety requirements? The owner repeated that the worker is special needs. I tell her that there must have been someone responsible for overseeing DancingGirl during her shifts? The owner repeats that DancingGirl is special needs. I tell the owner that that excuse doesn't absolve the restaurant from meeting basic safety standards. The owner repeats that DancingGirl is special needs. I ask the owner if she cares that this special needs staff member could have hurt co-workers or herself by dancing and swinging a hot beverage around. Owner repeats that DancingGirl is special. I tell the owner that because of her inability to properly train or supervise her staff I won't be returning. Response? I should be more understanding and accepting. I tell the owner that she should be less accepting of staff members licking food, and I hung up on her.",

We were staying at a waterpark resort and left the resort to get dinner because it was late (about 10pm) and nothing was open there. We were there to order appetizers and drinks and dessert. When we walked in, the hostess sat us without saying a single word. Whatever, we didn't care. We sat and talked and didn't get any drinks or service for about 15 minutes. We started playing on the tablet and realized we could order appetizers and dessert off of it. We ordered the appetizers we wanted and 10 minutes after that, a girl rushes up to the table and gets our drink order. She doesn't apologize or anything but still, we weren't too bothered by it. She comes back with drinks 10 minutes later and by this time someone had already brought out our appetizer. \n\nAt this time, I can tell my fiancé is a little annoyed but we eat and feel better. She doesn't come back again for 15 minutes. We order dessert when she comes back and she says it will be right out. A guy from the kitchen brings it out a little later and we finish it. She doesn't check up on us at all again. My fiancé tries waving her down and she doesn't see. Finally, he pays on the tablet and we left. I know he didn't leave her a decent tip. On the way out, the hostess ignores us. It was honestly the worst service I've ever had. \n\n",

        "text": "I work nights and woke up on my Friday night absolutely starving. I placed a delivery order with a restaurant that I hadn't tried yet. I'd had some issues with new delivery drivers in the past because the apartment I was living in had the exact same street address as a nearby lumber store used to have. When I placed my order I gave them explicit instructions not to use Google maps because they will get lost and end up at a lumber store. They said no worries, they knew exactly where I lived.\n\nAfter about an hour I was wondering where my food was. The restaurant was maybe ten minutes from me and for normal people it was a slow Wednesday night. After another 30 minutes, right when I was about to call the store, I got a call from the delivery driver. From the start it was pretty clear the guy was stoned off his ass. \n\nDelivery Guy: Hey man, where are you? I'm at some weird lumber place. \n\nMe: You used Google maps, didn't you?\n\nDG: Yeah man! It's awesome!\n\nI'll admit that I was feeling a hangry at this point, but I tried to be cool and not throw a rude tone at the guy.\n\nMe: Whenever people use Google maps to get here they end up at the lumber yard. To get here take a left out of there, go a quarter mile and my street is on the left. It's actually the first left turn you'll pass. If you hit a stop light you've gone to far. I'm the first building on the left.\n\nDG: Awesome!\n\nMe: Does that make sense?\n\nDG: Yeah man! I got it!\n\nI walk out to my front balcony to wait for the guy since it should only take him a minute to get to me. After about five minutes my irritation grows. Then the phone rings.\n\nDG: Where are you man?\n\nMe: I'm still at my apartment waiting for you to deliver my food. Where are you?\n\nDG: I dunno. I went through a couple of lights, but I don't see your road.\n\nMe: That's because you drove past my road.\n\nI gave him directions on how to get to mynplave from the other direction. It ended with, \"...the second right after the light.\" Please bear in mind that he has my street address and the road is clearly labeled.\n\nI wait another 5 minutes and then the phone rings again.\n\nDG: I'm on your street, but I don't see your apartment building.\n\nI've been outside for at least 10 minutes and not a single car has gone by.\n\nMe: What street did you turn on.\n\nDG: I turned on \"Wrong St.\".\n\nMe: That's the wrong road. I live on \"Right St.\". It's the next one up. Why don't I stay on the phone with you until you get here.\n\nDG: Awesome man!\n\nI wait a minute and then I see DG slowly Sri e by my apartment.\n\nMe: You just drove by me. I'm the guy waving to you. Do you see me?\n\nDG: Yeah!\n\nDG keeps driving forward.\n\nMe: Dude, you're going the wrong way.\n\nDG: How do you know where I'm going. \n\nMe: Well, because I can see you and you're supposed to be coming here. I'm in the first building you passed on your left. I'm standing out front.\n\nDG stops and starts backing up his car. I'm so hungry and the food is so close. Then he stops in front of my building and pulls into the parking lot of the building across the street.\n\nMe: You just turned into the wrong building. I am standing directly behind you waving my hands I  the air. Do you see me?\n\nDG: Hey! There you are!\n\nThe guy finally turns around and parks. He comes walking up to me almost two hours after I placed my order. I'm so frustrated, but I'm even more hungry. I just want to grab my food and go inside.\n\nDG: Wow man! That was hard!\n\nHe hands me the giant heater bag that the food is delivered in and starts to walk off.\n\nMe: Do these things come free with a meal now?\n\nDG: What? Oh shit man! I need that!\n\nHe walks back over and pulls my food from the bag. Then he skips off to his car and leaves. I'm still standing there in disbelief. He never even gave me the credit card receipt to sign and tip. The worst part was all of my food was cold. Needless to say, I never ordered from them again. ",

We did not really mind, we ordered our soft drinks, and went back to the menu.\n\nThe server comes back with our drinks, which were all watered down. Red flag one, but again we did not really care.\n\nWe order our stuff (which was not cheap), and then we wait. About ten minutes later, a family with a screaming child (who was definitely old enough to not still be screaming, we are talking 10 to 12 years old), who then order their stuff. Another ten minutes go by, they get their stuff, and end up leaving after ten minutes. Red flag 2, as we have yet to receive our stuff after another family came in and ordered similar things.\n\nWe began to talk about just leaving since we have not received our food, then our server \"magically\" appears with our stuff. Most of it had already cooled off, and their cheese covered bread rolls were obviously frozen then stuck in a microwave with cheddar cheese, as they were soggy, the outside was steaming hot, and the inside was practically frozen. Our meals were much smaller than what both the pictures and the prices made us believe.\n\nHowever, that is not the worst part. The worst part is that our server seemingly forgot to give us our bill, and we sat and waited for an hour before we got fed up and stormed to the person at front and demanded a refund. \nGuess who was sitting there with our bill in hand talking to another server?\n\nYes, our server wasted our time chatting with another server instead of doing what she was paid to do. She had the audacity to try to guilt us into giving her a tip and to buy their shitty gift card.\n\nThat is all I remember unfortunately.",

After the customary greeting, (which went on far longer than expected) we were ready to put in our drink orders. As we were telling him what we wanted, he kind of started to go into his life story. When he finally went back to get our drinks, everyone started taking to each other. It took a while, but our waiter finally made it back with our drinks. But then he wouldn't leave. He tried to...I don't know, put on a show for us? It was awkward and cringy, and it went on and on to the point to where we were wondering if he was ever going to take our food orders. He finally took them, but everyone had to repeat their orders several times before he got it. Eventually we just pointed to what we wanted on the menu, and even then there was confusion. \n\nThroughout the meal he was very attentive, which was fine. But the thing was that he pretty much stayed at our table and talked to us the whole time. Eventually other customers came in and he left. \n\nWhen we got the check, everything was fine. I put the money in the envelope thing and waited...and waited and waited and waited. I was about to get up to find him when he finally showed up. Another lengthy conversation and he said \"alright folks, have a great day and we'll see you next time.\" I had to tell him not to say goodbye quite yet because I still needed my change. Then I waited. And waited and waited and waited some more. He finally made it back out (by this time everyone was standing up waiting to leave) surprisingly he didn't say much this time. I left him a decent tip, but I'm hoping that the next time we go back we'll get a different waiter.

Due to our frequenting, we've come to recognize that there's two consistent employees at this place, and anyone else is just someone who will likely be cycled out quickly.\n\nOne day, we catch an employee we've never dealt with. My sister walks up to the counter and begins to order. We're a little short on cash, so we're going for the cheaper option of getting half a roll rather than a full roll, so we can both eat our preferred meals. My sister tells the employee this, and he pulls out a roll and a knife.\n\nInstead of cutting the bread in half, however, he slices it open and begins to go on like normal. Thinking that he maybe didn't hear when my sister asked for the meal to be a six inch sandwich, my sister spoke up. This was months ago, so I'm paraphrasing, but it basically went like this:\n\nMy sister said \"Wait, I said a six inch.\" The employee looked up at the both of us.\n\n\"I know, but it's a better deal to get the full size sandwich.\"\n\nMy sister and I are dumbfounded. \"I understand it's a better deal, but we don't have that much money and I didn't ask for a full size, I asked for a six inch.\"\n\nThe employee seems annoyed, but he obliges and cuts the roll in half and continues taking the order like normal.\n\nHe did screw up the order further, like my sister asked for banana peppers and he gave her jalapenos, but I digress. All that matters is the next time we went in, we saw no trace of him. It's been about a year and I've literally never seen him anymore, so it's safe to say he no longer works there.

My girlfriend and I came into this cell phone store because she need to turn in her old phone since she got her new phone. This isn't about bad customer service but rather about this one customer who was giving this poor sales associate a really hard time.\n\nNow, I wasn't really paying attention when this lady was first talking to the sales associate because I was playing Pokemon Go for about five minutes. I got bored after and exited the game. I only started paying attention to this lady when I began looking at the different items in the store ranging from phones to iPads and tablets to phone accessories.\n\nI can here this lady giving the sales associate attitude. Basically complaining about every phone this poor guy showed her, because I'm guessing she's also doing a trade in. There is just nothing pleasant about her at all. The guy is just doing his best to accommodate this woman and her phone needs but she just keeps up with this attitude and complains about each phone he shows that they are all crappy. She finally decides to pick a new phone regardless of her opinion of how crappy said phone is. He then begins doing the transaction for this lady.\n\nMeanwhile, this friendly sales associate is helping my girlfriend out buy helping her get some new accessories for her new phone. While my girlfriend is finishing up her transaction. I look over and the lady is again giving this poor man a hard time.\n\nFrom what I can gather, it seems she had changed her mind about her exchange because she didn't like something about her new phone. I don't know what it was but apparently she got more upset about this when the man told her, he couldn't reverse the process. Then she proceeded to complain about how she lost all her contacts and all that noise or whatever.\n\nI can understand the frustration of this sales associate because he tried helping her at the beginning and he tried explaining his store policy to her and even often to help her after the transaction was over but she just turned him down and continued to be rude to him.\n\nAfter she left the store, everyone including the few other customers at the store complained about how rude she was. No sales associate nor other customers liked her.\n\nI wanted to blurt out while she was still there, \"next time write down all the contacts' numbers before doing a phone exchange\". I did say it but after she left. I know most cases, people take their sim card out which holds all the info, I don't think this lady did however. Nor do I think she thought things through carefully.

I told her no thanks, and to please just make sure we don't get charged for it since we didn't get it. She said \"you won't get charged, I forgot to even put it in.\"\n\nNow we order a pizza. Nothing too complicated, just a medium with a few toppings. After waiting what felt like forever I realized the table next to us, a group of 6 who came in about 15 minutes after us, had already gotten their pizza and were almost done eating. At this point I've got 30 minutes before I've got to be back to my next seminar.  Finally the manager comes over to apologize,  and he tells us the waitress forgot to put in our pizza order. I was so pissed. He didn't charge us for the pizza, but the waitress never came back to apologize or anything. As I was getting up to leave she stopped and asked if I wanted more water. \n\nI still feel kinda bad for not tipping at all, but that was horrible.",

        "text": "You guys. Today, for the first time in my life, I went to customer service and complained to a manager. And it was over something so *freaking* stupid that I'm still pissed off about it. \n\nI was checking out, and the cashier put my gallon of lemonade in a single bag. I am by myself, and live on the second floor, so I double bagged it, then put it in my cart. The next item was 2 bottles of iced tea, so I did the same thing and double bagged it. \n\nI hear the cashier say, \"Uh, really? Wow.\" with this tone that was so pissy that it made me actually look up, thinking someone was doing something crazy and I could commiserate. But nope. She was looking at me and shaking her head. \"If you want me to double bag everything, you just have to ask.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's okay, I just wanted to double bag these because they're...\"\n\n\"It's FINE. I don't mind. It is my *job*.\"\n\n\"It's just that it's too heavy that way, that's all. I don't mind doing it myself, it's no big deal.\"\n\nShe just rolled her eyes, and I was gonna let it go, but *you guys*. She then put every single item in its own bag, and double bagged most of it. I am not exaggerating. Even the lady behind me in line was just staring at her like she was crazy. \n\nI let her bag everything, and didn't say a word. I put it all in the cart, paid for my stuff, and went directly to customer service. I told them their cashier might need to be retrained, and showed them my cart. The guy offered to rebag my items and said he'd talk to her, but I just thanked him and left. \n\nThen I got home and started unpacking and putting everything away and it just pissed me off all over again, so here I am. [I took a picture.](https://imgur.com/E8cQ5jj) \n\n26 items, 48 bags.\n",

        "text": "This happened about a month ago. I called my local grocery store and ordered a platter of taco dip to be picked up the afternoon of the following day for my boyfriend's birthday party. The next day I went in and approached the deli counter to pick up my order, and a young guy probably in his early 20s was behind the counter.\n\n&gt;Me: Hi, I called yesterday and placed an order for a platter of taco dip to be picked up today, name is gothiccheesepuff.\n\n&gt;Guy: Well we have taco dip over there (he points behind me to the shelf about 30 ft away holding the small premade taco dip plates). Just go grab one of those.\n\n&gt;Me (pretty confused as this was my first time ever placing an order with the deli): Uhh okay, are you sure? I called in yesterday and someone took my order for a medium-sized taco dip platter.\n\n&gt;Guy: Yeah. Just go get the taco dip over there, it's the same thing.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay...\n\nI was about to turn away and grab some of the small plates like he said. I hadn't paid for the dip I ordered yet and I wasn't totally sure how much it was going to cost or how big it was supposed to be. Luckily, an older woman behind the counter overheard the end of our conversation and interjected.\n\n&gt;Woman: What's the name on the order?\n\n&gt;Me: gothiccheesepuff\n\n&gt;Woman: One second.\n\nShe goes to the back room and returns with this ENORMOUS platter of dip with my order form taped to the top. It was honestly probably the size of 7 or 8 of the smaller plates the guy was referring me to. The woman finished the transaction for me and handed me the platter.\n\n&gt;Guy: Oh, uh, I thought what you wanted was the same as the taco dip we have over there.\n\n&gt;Me: Sure, it's fine.\n\nNo apology or anything and he was pretty rude throughout the entire ordeal. I don't know if the guy was new or what. Anyway, everyone at the party loved the taco dip and we finished every last bite.",

        "text": "So...I may be in the wrong for how I reacted in the end but I thought I would share the story anyway. \n\nSo i order a pizza around 630. Its 8-Now its a friday night, I understand but I call just to see where my pizza is. I hit the original button that tells me to check on an order-goes to beep sound, almost like a fax. \n\nSo I admit-I'm frustrated, I'm starving.  But i call back, hit button 1 to talk to a real person? No, she immediately transfers me again to a line that does nothing. I attempted to just ask where my pizza was but she wanted nothing to do with it. \n\nSo i call again? Ask for a manager and same deal! She transfers me to another line.  Guess what? Fax sound. At this point its 9 pm, I give up, I make myself a snack and then I call back again and I admit I said, \"I dont want my damn pizza's anymore.\" I may have dropped a f bomb which in my mind is not excusable but whatever, I did do it and the women basically told me before hand. \"There's no manager, there's nothing I can do, It'll get there.\" Now-She didn't say that verbatim, but you get the idea. \n\nSo, my mom was the one who used her card to pay-The money was put back and I go online to said pizza's place corporate website and file a complaint.\n\nI leave my cell number so I can talk to whomever. They call the house and I call back.  I call back again and she never returns my phone call. Needless to say, I have refused to go back to this pizza place because it's franchised and If I want that deliciously gooey cheese filled crust or flavored crust I gotta drive my butt to get one (and I have and it was delicious and oh so worth the drive.) \n\nMaybe yelling at them was a butt head behavior but god it was the most frustrating thing! I would have gladly waited for my pizza but an hour and a half went by and I just wanted a time, nothing more. ",

Needless to say, I moved to another line as this took forever.\n\nNow I've shopped at this place as long as I can remember and sometimes use it as an \"ATM machine\", but I never would have thought of that loophole.

        "text": "Yesterday I had to meet my husband somewhere during dinner time so I decided to grab fast food for us and my three kids. I went through and ordered, then pulled into a parking spot out of the way to hand out food to the two kids that were awake and make sure I had everything before I got too far away. They had forgotten the nuggets for my two year old and the bag of cookies I had ordered. I gave her the fries so she wouldn’t throw a fit, she was hungry and likes fries best, so she stopped complaining about wanting food. I obviously didn’t want to go inside (kids are too young to be left in the car and dragging three kids and a baby inside for missing items... there is a reason I use the drive through) so I got drove back over to the menu board. Fortunately there wasn’t much of a line.\n\nSide note, I was totally polite the whole time, I have worked fast food, I get it, mistakes happen.\n\nThe speaker lady told me to pull forward after I explained what happened, but when I got to the second window, he got pissy.\n\nHim: “What were you missing?”\n\nMe: “The nuggets and the cookies.” \n\nHim: snotty tone, “I remember giving you the cookies. Do you have the bags still?”\n\nMe: “Yes, but I have handed out most of the food. I had a bag with the fries, I had the pies...”\n\nHim, interrupting rudely: “I gave you the pies! I remember!”\n\nMe: “Yes, I have the pies, I don’t have the nuggets or the cookies. Look, do you need my receipt?”\n\nHim: “Fine!”\n\nHe took the receipt then brought me my stuff after a couple minutes and slammed the window.\n\nLook, I get that there are scammers out there, but legit mistakes do happen, and I have never been treated that way over one. I rarely go to this location, I went because it was the closest to where my husband was (still a half hour out, he was in the boonies) and I wanted it to be relatively fresh for him. It’s also in a more affluent part of town and my van is a bit of a junky car on the outside, mismatched panel, window wouldn’t open. I wonder if he saw my car and figured I was just trying to get free food. But how often are scammers politely asking for the two items missed rather than demanding a full refund and more food? \n\nTL;DR: Drive through employee was a total jerk when I tried to get the treat I ordered for my kids that they forgot, as well as my two year olds dinner.",

        "text": "Hi there! Retail worker with a funny story as a customer, here. \n\nI was shopping in a department store in the mall that I work in on my lunch break, looking through their clearance items. Popped into the changeroom to try on the items that I'd picked and decided on everything except a pair of shorts that didn't fit. \n\nAs I was leaving the change room I noticed an empty shelf-cart next to the doorway. I naturally assumed this was for items to be returned to the shelves as most clothing stores do that. \n\nI dropped the shorts I didn't want onto the cart and started walking away, when I heard someone behind me say to themselves, \"Are you f-cking kidding me, this b-tch is just going to drop her sh-t here, I'm not your f-cking slave, f-ckign slobs.\" \n\nI turned around, an apologetic look on my face, and said \"Oh my goodness I'm so sorry I didn't realize, I thought the cart was for returns, I'll put it away myself, I apologize!\"\n\nThe girl turned bright red and started stammering apologies as she basically ran into the back room next to the change rooms. \n\nI work retail too, girl. I know it can be stressful and customers can be jerks and we all have bad days, but save it for the breakroom. Don't curse out customers on the floor, even under your breath. If I had been someone else there's a good chance she would have gotten in a lot of trouble. I've seen people canned for less. ",

I spent about 30 minutes looking for at least 1 motorized cart with no luck what so ever. Eventually, I went to the customer service desk and asked for 2 motorized carts. I explained the situation and the lady behind the customer service desk was very understanding of my situation. However, when she called over one of the associates who I guess had a device with which she could find out what was available and could call in for assistance, that associate was very stand-offish. I don't know why, but it really left a bad taste in my mouth.",
