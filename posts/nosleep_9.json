        "text": "My dad killed himself back in 2006. I was too young at the time to really understand why he had done this, but after 15+ years of having grown up and lived my life without ever really knowing him I kinda developed a new interest in his life after my aunt showed me some of the investigative journalism work he had done back in the 90s.\n\n A few hours ago I was able to brute force the password to an old laptop he had, and view his files, and I read over his digital journal that he had kept, which mostly consisted of some drafts of articles and reports he had been working on. Most were pretty interesting actually, involving local corruption in my home state and an unreleased report about some environmental protection violations from a large oil company. \n\nI read thru most of the drafts he had, and eventually I stumbled upon a document about an old missing person's case that I hadn't heard before. I'm not really even gonna begin to try to explain or narrate the things that I read, so it's probably best if I just paste the text here.  \n\n\nOn October 17th, 1998, Kayla Lawrence, aged 7 and her father, Scott Lawrence, were seen alive for the last time.  \n\nThey had left their home in Lincoln, Nebraska at 9:00 AM to visit the Calvin Lake recreation area to hike a trail in the surrounding woods and take pictures with a FujiFilm MX-700 Scott had purchased the day prior. When they had not returned by 5:00 PM, several hours after Scott had said they would be home, his wife Kimberly Lawrence called the police.\n\nBy 6 PM police had arrived at the recreation area, and search teams were not far behind. The first ground search covered the southern half of the forest without luck over the course of the night of October 17th, and early in the morning of October 18th they began scouring the northern half. At 4:00 AM a member of the search party discovered a pink shoe identified as having had belonged to Kayla Lawrence laying in a gully, and a few minutes later they found the coat Scott had been wearing when he had left home, ripped into tatters and hanging from a tree branch. The investigation was immediately expanded as there was now evidence of foul play, and when nothing further had been found by 7 AM, the FBI was contacted for forensic analysis.  \n\nOver the course of the next few weeks, there was nothing. No leads, no explanation, and no answers. Detectives first interviewed the hysterical Mrs. Lawrence only to be told that Scott had been a loving husband and father, a claim backed up by the testimony of friends and relatives. He had no history of mental illness and no debts, and the possibility of Scott having been responsible for their disappearance was quickly ruled out due to the fact that their car had been left at the recreation area parking lot with his wallet in the glove box, and the coat found in the forest. Civilians who had been in the area between the hours of 9 to 6 PM were questioned, and none reported any abnormality, except for a single man.  \n\nA fisherman who had been on the eastern shore of Calvin Lake around noon had reported that he had heard peculiar metallic scraping sounds coming from the woods, and a few minutes later, a deep rumble that he estimated to have come from a half mile within the woods. He said that after the rumbling noise had stopped he experienced a wave of nausea and lightheadedness that was accompanied by an abnormal pulse sensation in his chest. Convinced he was experiencing a stroke, he retreated back to the parking lot to call 911, only for the nausea and lightheadedness to instantly vanish as soon as he stepped onto the asphalt. The perplexed detectives kept the recording of his statement but did not take it seriously at the time.\n\nThe investigation had so far been completely stagnant, and the hope of finding Kayla and Scott gradually dwindled as the weeks turned with indifference, and by December the team of detectives was cut down sharply, as zero progress had been made in locating them. It was seen as incredibly unlikely that either would be found, even less likely that they might be alive somewhere, until something finally happened on December 4th that got the ball rolling.\n\nAt 2 AM during the early morning of December 4th, a known drug addict by the name of Randall Wilkes was hospitalized after he crashed into a telephone pole in front of an apartment complex in Lincoln. A witness standing a block away when the crash occurred reported to police that he had hit the pole going at least 90 MPH, and after he had totaled his car, he kicked out the crumpled door, and limped away from the wreck before collapsing on the side of the street. Randall regained consciousness at the hospital and had to be sedated after he ripped his IV out of his arm and gouged out his left eye with it. He was restrained, and his blood was tested for any abnormalities that might explain his behavior only for his results to come back completely clean. When he woke up he began deliriously swinging between screaming nonsense and crying profusely whilst begging for mercy to something unknown. During one of his begging fits, he whimpered that he had put something in the backseat of the car that he needed to “return”, which was deemed to be of interest to police due to his current mental state. An officer was sent to the tow yard that held the remains of Randall’s car, and in the floorboard of the backseat he found the filthy, mud-stained clothes that Kayla Lawrence had been wearing when she disappeared. Randall was immediately placed under arrest at the hospital for suspicion of kidnapping Kayla and Scott Lawrence, and an officer was sent to guard him at the hospital.\n\nRandall’s house was immediately searched by a team of detectives. Whilst scouring through the filthy, half rotting trailer one detective discovered that the master bedroom furthest from the entrance was boarded up, and he used a crowbar to pry the boards off and enter. The room, in stark contrast to the knee deep garbage piles and stained walls in the rest of the house, was completely empty, spotless and clean. There was a single window, also boarded shut, but otherwise there was nothing of note. The detectives found this out of place cleanliness incredibly strange, and made note of it within their police reports, and one detective included a small note scribbled in the margins that stated that he swore he had heard soft whispering noises coming from the walls.\n\nThe next day, Randall Wilkes was dead.  He was 34 years old, and had killed himself by throwing himself out of a hospital window. During one of his screaming breakdowns he was able to dislocate his thumb and pull his hand out of the handcuffs that locked him to his gurney, and he began bashing his head and arms against the reinforced glass. The police officer stationed outside ran into the room and attempted to wrestle Randall away from the window, but he was thrown against the gurney which fell on him, breaking his legs and incapacitating him. Randall eventually broke a big enough hole in the glass to squeeze his emaciated, bleeding body out of, and he fell to his death from the fifth story. According to the police officer who had been crippled by Randall, his last words were a shriek of “You’ve never seen it”, before he pulled himself out of the window.\n\nRandall’s death would be remembered, but not for his suspected involvement in the kidnappings. The nature of his death was picked up by tabloid publications that falsely sensationalized him as a PCP addict who had crippled a cop and broke through a window with his bare hands, only to survive the fall and run off, never to be seen again, and his story was one of the first to pop up in the late 90’s that began a widespread moral panic against these so called “zombie drugs” that would soon be infiltrating suburban communities across America. His name has been consigned to folklore since then, but to the team of detectives working on the Lawrence case, it was a huge blow to their momentum, as Randall had been unable to give the detectives any real information concerning the disappearance. Nevertheless, Randall’s relatives were interviewed, his past was scrubbed for anything that might be helpful to the investigation, and the woods behind his trailer were searched painstakingly. Nothing was found, and the only connection Randall had to the case was his unexplained possession of Kayla’s clothes. The investigation once again screeched to a halt, and the case went dormant yet again. Weeks passed. Then months. Kimberly Lawrence tragically committed suicide in late February, and seven days after her funeral, on March 3rd, a call was made to Lancaster County Sheriff's office from Anchorage, Alaska.  \n\nKayla Lawrence had been found.  \n\nA hunter who lived a few miles outside of Bethel, Alaska had been investigating a recent wave of incidents in which various types of wildlife in the surrounding areas of the town had been found unnaturally dismembered, and while searching the woods to the east of Bethel, he had discovered a rock alcove containing the fresh corpse of a small girl. The hunter immediately contacted authorities, and the emaciated body was sent to Anchorage for autopsy. Upon arrival, her fingerprints were taken and uploaded into the state database, and an automated program matched the fingerprints to a set of identical fingerprints that had been taken from Kayla Lawrence during a medical checkup a year prior, to the surprise of the coroner.  \n\nThe body was examined soon after. Kayla’s skull had been shattered in five places, several of her teeth were missing, and her hands had been nearly torn completely off of her arms, being only attached by a few tendons. Accounting for sub-zero temperatures, her time of death was estimated to have been only around three days before having been found, and the official cause of death was listed as blunt force head trauma with an unknown implement. After the detectives in Lincoln had been contacted, documents were faxed to them, and the body was sent to Nebraska for burial whilst a search team from Bethel was organized to search for Scott. The reaction back in Nebraska was a mixture of confusion and bewilderment, to say the least.  \n\nThere was something else however. A badly damaged FujiFilm MX-700 that had been found in the alcove with Kayla. Whilst the search teams scrubbed the forests around Bethel, a lone detective in Alaska spent hours attempting to recover the data from the camera thinking that he might finally uncover the truth, and after two days of tinkering, he was able to transfer pictures from the camera to his computer.\n\nThe first picture was a still shot of a tree, with nothing abnormal visible, and the next few pictures were more of the same. There was a picture taken from the woods of a man knee deep in water casting a fishing pole, several pictures of flowers and wildlife, and a picture of Kayla standing in front of a tree, smiling, with a smudge of a hand barely visible reaching from behind a tree in the background.\n\nThe next picture was a blurry mass of trees shot as if the photo had been taken while in motion, and the next was a low angled shot of a dark mass that seemed to be the leg of an adult male, with the tips of someone’s fingers reaching in from the right side, barely in frame. There were many following images, but they were all dark and blurry, and no specific objects were identifiable within them.\n\nExcept for the final image.\n\nThe picture was taken from a waist height position, at a slight tilt to the left, and there was snow blanketing the trees. Scott Lawrence was dangling a few inches off the snowy ground with his naked body pressed against a tree, and a tight black cord was tied around his neck and hanging him from a tree branch. His right leg was severed at the mid shin, and his mouth was covered in blood. An ominous crack in the lens had left a crooked line across his gaunt chest. Beside him stood a tall man dressed in a dark brown lounge suit, with a brimmed fedora held in both hands in front of him, and where his face should have been, there was nothing but a black haired head, twisted completely around, with the backsides of his ears were facing the camera.  \n\nScott Lawrence’s body was never found.",

        "text": "[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11eutcx/my_wife_and_i_ended_up_in_a_world_where_the_south/)\n\nWith a sense of unease creeping up my spine, I take a seat at my desk and prepare to dive back into the story. The memories are still fresh, vivid, and haunting, but I know I can’t leave it unfinished. So, with trembling hands and a pounding heart, I take a deep breath and begin once again.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe two men escaped the chaotic scene and drove away with us in the back seat. My mind tried to process what I had just witnessed. The men in the car with us were silent, and we didn’t dare to speak. After a while, one of them turned to us and said, \"You’re lucky we found you. If we hadn’t, you would never have seen the light of day again. Now, who the bloody hell are you?”\n\n“Why did you rescue us if you don’t even know who we are?” I asked.\n\n“A friend of the cause said you were important and told us about the transport,” the man next to the driver said. “He said you could be of help in our struggle. Now, *who* are you?”\n\n“We’re not from around here,” Shanice said. “We’re legally married, in this country, and we were on our way to our honeymoon.”\n\n“You’re from New York or something?” the driver asked. “Coming *here* for your honeymoon?”\n\n“No,” I said. “But listen, something strange is going on. On our way here, something fell from the sky. And it—” I was interrupted by two strangely round helicopters appearing overhead. The driver took a sharp turn and continued up a smaller road which was covered by the canopy of some trees and sped up. “It was a meteor of some kind, or maybe something else.”\n\n“A *meteor*?” asked the man next to the driver. “Our source told us you had some connection to the Japanese, but that he didn’t believe you were spies. So, what’s your deal? We do some dealings with the Kempeitai… sometimes, and *only* when it benefits the cause.”\n\n“We’re Shanice and James Robertson.” Shanice leaned in between their seats. “And we’re from The United States of America.”\n\n“Is this for some kind of game?” asked the driver. “Anyway, I’m Omar and my friend here is Khalid. We’re members of the AJS.”\n\n“What’s that?” Shanice asked. “Some socialist movement?”\n\n“Say what?” asked Omar. “You don’t know about AJS? The African Jacobin Society? The only *true* rebels in this country, the one and only revolutionary organization fighting for the old liberté, égalité, fraternité?”\n\nHaving evaded the choppers, we entered a garage adjoining a dilapidated house in what looked like a poor suburb. There were some other people staying at the house, sitting in a circle and having a discussion. The youngest was a ten-or-so-year-old girl. As soon as we stepped out of the car, they all stood up and looked at us suspiciously.\n\nOmar introduced us to them, still holding his rifle as if ready to point it at us at a moment’s notice. “These are the people we were told you about.” He spoke to the group. “Shanice and James. They claim to be married and from The United States of America. Now, in our hearts we’re all from The United States of America… but I’m getting the feeling they mean something stronger. And not only that but they’re also affiliated with the Japanese somehow.”\n\n“I know it’s difficult to believe,” I said. “We were traveling down what you call Rebel Route, which is called Route 1 where we’re from, and then out of the blue something came down from the sky…”\n\n“We think it was a meteor,” Shanice continued. “A part of it crashed right next to our car and the rest of it mysteriously vanished from the sky before it hit the ground. Otherwise, it would’ve destroyed the entire region.”\n\n“Fairy tales!” said an old man in the group. “This is what you risked your lives for? That’s what you risked revealing our position for? They must’ve escaped a mental institution. This isn’t a story by Jules Verne, it’s *reality*.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” said Khalid. “They were transported inside one of CLEA’s armored wags. Granted, it was traveling alone, but still… These two individuals are clearly important to them, which means they’re an asset no matter their bizarre cover story.”\n\n“You aren’t going to sell us out, are you,” Shanice said, “because that would be ironic. And we aren’t lying, there’s something going on beyond our—”\n\n“We won’t give you up,” said Omar. “But we didn’t rescue you only of the goodness of our hearts, either. We’re fighting for freedom and enlightenment for everyone, and you’re going to have to play a part in that fight whether you want to or not. I’m *hoping* you’ll do it willingly. If you’re Japanese spies, you should want to bring down our government just as much as we do.”\n\nShanice picked up her phone from the evidence bag. “We aren’t spies. In our world, where we’re from, The Empire of Japan — The British Empire too — dissolved a very long time ago. Democracy won, slavery was abolished, and the United States become one of the greatest nations on Earth. That’s the truth!” She held up her phone. “And I can prove it to you right here, and right now.”\n\nShe turned on her phone and unlocked it. This, just seeing the device turn on, seemed to create a bit of a reaction.\n\n“Is that European?” asked a woman. “I’ve never seen such a small VB before.”\n\n“It’s American-made,” I said while Shanice went through her album. “We call it an *iPhone*, but the more generic term for it is a cell phone. I’m guessing you have those as well?”\n\n“Oh, a mobile phone,” said the little girl. “Yeah, we have those, but they don’t light up like that and the most popular one is called a Dixie Dialer. It’s kind of both a calculator and a phone because you can access the netway on it.”\n\n“Okay,” said Shanice. “Watch *this*.” She held up the display and then played a video she took during a large Black Lives Matter rally in Washington, D.C. Thousands of people, mostly African-Americans, had shown up. American flags — the good version — could be seen everywhere and the Capitol Building could clearly be seen in the background. The group looked at the screen, confused and bewildered judging by the looks on their faces.\n\n“I want to see too!” said the girl whereupon Omar picked her up and let her watch as well. “What’s going on?” she then asked.\n\n“This is *our* capital,” Shanice said. “Washington, D.C.”\n\n“I-I can’t believe my eyes,” said the old man. “That building was burned to the ground a long, long time ago. How—how on earth is this possible?”\n\n“We don’t know,” I said. “It had something to do with that meteor.”\n\nAfter the video finished, everyone was silent for a moment. Omar sat down on a chair with his face in his palms, most likely trying to make sense of what he had just witnessed. In a matter of minutes, a big part of their worldview had been shattered. The little girl spoke up before anyone else:\n\n“You said slavery was forbidden in your world, but then why was everyone shouting all those things?”\n\nShanice crouched down and faced her. “What’s your name?”\n\n“Celine.”\n\n“Well, Celine, even on my Earth — where we defeated the south during the civil war — people still treat our people unfairly. Just as the *idea* of the United States never died here, the *idea* of the Confederacy never died on my Earth. An idea can’t be killed very easily, for better or for worse, so even where I’m from we have to fight every day to keep racism at bay.”\n\n“It’s real then,” Khalid said. “I don’t know how else to explain it. Sure, we have moving pictures, but nothing comes even close to that and certainly not on a small device — not even the Japanese ones. What now? What does this mean?”\n\nA discussion ensued, and it was hard to keep up with what everyone was saying. Some argued for exploring the possibility to trade with our world, some argued for showing the black community the video to inspire hope and get the revolution going and some argued that it was all just some kind of trick — even after what they had seen. In the end, Omar raised his voice.\n\n“We need to focus on the here and now. Eventually, this can mean a number of things — great things, for sure — but for now, we have to focus on how to make use of this unique situation *right now*. I say we set up a trap for CLEA. They’ll be desperate to get their hands on Shanice and her husband. We can use that to negotiate the release of some of our leaders. Maybe even Léon Moreau! We could decide on a place that’s to our advantage, and then we ambush them. Having some of our captured leaders back would mean a lot to the cause.”\n\n“Hold on,” Shanice said. “If we’re going to be the bait here, we need some guarantees that once all of this is over, you’ll help us get back home. From there—if it’s at all possible—we can establish some kind of alliance between our worlds.”\n\nOmar stepped up to her and grabbed her shoulder. “By the light of truth,” he said, “I promise we’ll do what we can to help you when it’s time.”\n\n“You would need to help us get back to the impact crater,” I said. “They’ve set up a roadblock there, possibly a base, and it’s heavily guarded.”\n\n“What do you all say?” Omar asked the group. “Once we’ve lured CLEA into our trap and freed whomever they’re willing to trade, are you willing to get your hands dirty yet again to help our new friends and to establish contact with our brothers and sisters in their world?”\n\nEveryone nodded in agreement. A plan was quickly formed. They would set up a meeting place in a secluded area outside of the city and make sure to have enough people and weapons to take on CLEA. Shanice and I would be the bait, just as initially suggested, and would have to be ready for anything. The very idea of it caused my heart to race with anxious anticipation. Shanice felt confident that we could trust them, but I wasn’t equally convinced. *Did they truly believe us, and did they value us enough not to sacrifice us to get their people back?* The odds didn’t really matter though, this was the only alternative—our only hope.\n\nLater in the evening, after most of the planning was done, we sat with the group in front of what they called a Visionbox—or VB for short—and watched the news. Everyone was silent as the anchor, a blonde woman with a Confederate pin on her blazer, read the news.\n\n“Good evening, America. Tonight, we bring you the latest developments in the escalating crisis in the Pacific. The world is on edge as the Empire of Japan sent its naval fleet to Hawaii to stop the British Empire from deploying nuclear weapons on the island. The situation is getting tenser by the hour, and the threat of war looms over the region.”\n\nFootage of the naval fleets in the Pacific, with ships and submarines moving about, appeared on the screen.\n\n“Emperor Satoru has made it clear that he will not allow Hawaii to become a nuclear weapons platform,” the anchor continued, “and has issued strong warnings to both the British Empire and the Confederate States. The CSA has responded by mobilizing its own naval fleet into position, and tensions are high as the two sides stare each other down.”\n\nA map of the Pacific with markers showing the positions of the fleets was shown as the Anchor continued; “The stakes could not be higher in this game of brinksmanship. With the world watching, the slightest miscalculation could lead to a catastrophic conflict that could engulf the entire globe. The Japanese fleet, led by the fearsome Tsukuba aircraft carrier, is a formidable force that has the capability to strike at Hawaii with devastating force. Meanwhile, the British fleet, which includes the newest and most advanced battleships in the world, is determined to protect their allies and their strategic interests in the region.”\n\nBack in the studio, an expert commentator was interviewed.\n\n“This is an incredibly dangerous situation,” he said. “The Japanese are known for their fierce pride and their willingness to fight to the death. They see the deployment of nuclear weapons in Hawaii as a direct threat to their national security, and they will not back down easily. The CSA—”\n\n“These maniacs,” said a young woman in the group who appeared to be Celine’s mother. “Don’t they understand that we’re living on the same planet?”\n\n“They would rather see it destroyed than in enemy hands,” said Omar who had his arm wrapped around her shoulder.\n\n“There’s a new calculator game that’s taking the gaming community in the Confederate States storm,” continued the news anchor, “but it’s also causing some controversy among certain groups. The game, an ice cream truck simulator from a French software company, has become incredibly popular among families, with gamers of all ages enjoying the fun and light-hearted experience. However, there’s one character in the game that’s caught the attention of some Confederate citizens. The game features a female ice cream vendor who is dressed in a revealing outfit—a so-called *French swimsuit* which is illegal in most states—that some believe to be inappropriate for a family-friendly game. The French company has defended its character design, stating that it’s meant to be a fun and playful representation of the ice cream vendor profession and that they had no intention of causing—”\n\nOmar turned off the screen. “It’s getting late,” he said. “Let’s meet here tomorrow morning.” He looked at me and Shanice. “You two can stay here with me and Yolanda.”\n\nYolanda, Celine’s mother, turned toward him.\n\n“Isn’t that dangerous? What about Celine?”\n\n“Relax,” said Omar. “Khalid, could you please stay as well? Just to make sure we’re all as safe as we can be.”\n\nYolanda didn’t seem happy about it, but she accepted it.\n\nThe next few days were a blur of preparation and anticipation. We trained with the African Jacobin Society and learned how to use their weapons. Shanice and I also shared our knowledge of advanced technology and strategies from our world—albeit only on a very basic level—which seemed to amaze and inspire the group. Celine followed us everywhere and asked us endless questions about our world and our lives, and Shanice was always happy to tell her stories.\n\nFinally, the day of the ambush arrived. Omar made contact with CLEA and successfully made some kind of deal with them. The sun was shining almost mercilessly, and the air was thick with tension. Shanice and I were dressed in clothes provided by the group, and we both had weapons concealed on our bodies. We were ready for whatever was to come, although it didn’t feel like it.\n\nI sat next to Shanice in the back seat of Omar’s car. The radio was on, playing unrecognizable pop songs, and Khalid—next to Omar—held a burning cigarette outside his window. They seemed relaxed, albeit still worked up. Shanice held my arm tight. I tried to stay calm for her, but it was useless. My heart was racing, and I constantly had to wipe the sweat off my forehead.\n\nWe arrived at the agreed-upon location, a deserted industrial area outside the city, one hour or so before CLEA was to be expected. They parked the car in a secluded part of the area and remained seated. The AJS had their men placed everywhere, ready to ambush CLEA as soon as they arrived. All that was left to do now was to wait. It wouldn’t be long, but every second felt like an hour. The music on the radio, now put to a low volume, came to an abrupt stop.\n\n“You’re listening to A-OK America, your source for all things happening in the Confederate States of America. We interrupt this song to bring you an urgent update from the Pacific. Reports are coming in about a major explosion in the waters near the Hawaiian Islands. Details are scarce at this time, but sources say that the explosion occurred in the vicinity of a Japanese naval vessel. It’s unclear at this time what caused the explosion or the extent of the damage, but it’s believed that this could be a significant event in the ongoing standoff between the British Empire and the Japanese Empire in the Pacific.”\n\nKhalid turned up the volume slightly.\n\n“The Confederate government has yet to release an official statement regarding this incident, but it’s likely that this will only escalate an already precarious situation. We will continue to monitor this developing story and bring you updates as they become available. In the meantime, we advise our listeners in the Pacific region to stay tuned to A-Ok America for the latest news and updates on this developing situation. Now: Some words from our advertiser’s before we resume our regular—”\n\n“I think they’re here now,” said Omar. “Get ready.”\n\nWe drove down to the open area in the middle of the complex where the prisoner exchange was supposed to take place. One of CLEA’s armored vehicles stopped a few yards away from us. For a few minutes, nothing happened. I pressed Shanice’s hand.\n\n“It will be all right,” she said. “As soon as this is over with, we will find a way back home.”\n\nI gulped, wiping sweat from my brow. “I-I’m so damn scared.”\n\n“Me too.” Shanice kissed me. “But this is important. This means something. Maybe we were sent here to help this world somehow.”\n\n“We have some new developments in the ongoing standoff in the Pacific.” The host on the radio was back. “According to sources, the explosion earlier was not an accident. It appears to have been a deliberate attack by an unknown vessel. The Japanese have issued a statement accusing the British Empire of launching the attack, while the British have denied any involvement. As things seem to be happening quickly now, we’ll stay on the air covering this story as it develops—”\n\nTwo people finally stepped out of the vehicle in front of us. They were dressed in the same black cloaks as the agents from earlier. One of them opened the back of their vehicle while the other one spoke into a megaphone.\n\n“We’ll now present the prisoners! Step out of the vehicle and show us the individuals known as Shanice and James Robertson.”\n\nOne of their helicopters circled above, and a number of additional armored vehicles could be seen further down the road.\n\nKhalid, now holding his rifle, yelled out the window:\n\n“Show us Léon, or there’s no deal!”\n\nI looked at the rifle I concealed under my jacket, hoping I wouldn’t have to use it. If they showed Léon first, the plan was to attack immediately seeing that he was the most important one to them. In that case, me and Shanice wouldn’t have to get out of the car. That was unlikely to happen though, as they knew how much they wanted Léon back. Instead, they were in all likelihood going to show us someone of less importance first, after which the AJS would have to show me or Shanice in exchange for seeing Léon.\n\n“You know that’s not the deal!” the agent yelled back.\n\nI could feel my heart racing, and my hands growing slick with sweat. Shanice’s fingers brushed against my own, and I could tell she was just as anxious as I was at this point.\n\n\"We have to be ready for anything,\" I whispered, my eyes never leaving the CLEA agents in front of us.\n\nShanice nodded, her grip on her own weapon tightening.\n\nAnd then, as if on cue, the CLEA agent who had spoken through the megaphone made a sudden movement, and I heard the unmistakable sound of a gunshot. I couldn’t tell who had fired—or why—but in a split-second, everything turned into chaos. The AJS fired down from their hiding places. The vehicles down the road, never having turned their engines off it seemed, drove up to us at full speed. Armed men—dressed similarly to a SWAT team—rushed out of them and opened fire in all directions while running toward our car.\n\nShanice acted on instinct, pulling out her rifle and returning fire. I followed her lead, unleashing a hail of bullets that echoed through the deserted industrial complex. Khalid turned to Omar.\n\n“Get us out of here, now!” he yelled. “They never intended—”\n\nA bullet pierced the back of his head, blood splattering everywhere.\n\nFor a few chaotic moments, it was anyone’s guess who would come out on top, if anyone at all. AJS members emerged from other vehicles, exchanging fire with CLEA agents who were scrambling for cover. I caught glimpses of AJS members darting through the shadows, taking down their enemies with expert precision. But the CLEA agents were no slouches either and their own firepower was formidable.\n\nOmar, seemingly in shock, finally stepped on the gas——kicking up a cloud of dirt with the tires as he made a sharp U-turn——and raced toward the exit while yelling for his people to retreat even though no one could possibly hear him.  \n\nExplosions and gunfire echoed behind us, but I didn’t look back. We reached a highway that luckily wasn’t very busy. Two of the armed vehicles and a smaller, sleeker, vehicle with its sirens on followed close behind us. Omar took a sharp turn and drove down a ramp that led to a smaller road. The helicopter—like a giant horsefly—flew at a low altitude a few yards to our right. Khalid’s dead body was tossed here and there in its seat as the car turned and Omar had to push it away from him time and time again.\n\nI couldn’t imagine a way for us to get out of this situation. More police cars appeared behind us as we approached Richmond. This was the kind of situation that never ended in favor of the pursued.\n\n“BBN is showing some footage now,” said the host on the radio with a trembling voice. “T-There’s images of a flash of light, followed by a massive eruption of water and a shockwave. The destruction is catastrophic. I-I fear the worst. This is a nightmare. If this was a nuclear explosion, it’s hard to overstate the magnitude of the damage. The fallout from such an event could have far-reaching implications for the entire world, as we have been hearing from experts all morning. We are now seeing images of smoke and debris filling the sky, and it’s clear that this is a truly devastating event. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this terrible tragedy. This is, no doubt, a critical moment in history, and it’s important for the Confederate government to act swiftly and decisively to ensure the safety and security of all those in the Pacific.”\n\nI couldn’t quite fathom what they were saying in my state of shock, but Shanice picked up on it and said:\n\n“It’s all falling apart, James.”\n\nThe sun beat down on us as we careened through the streets of Richmond. I looked at Omar in the rear-view mirror in front of him. His face was set in a grim expression as he navigated the twisting roads.\n\nThe white marble buildings of the city rose high on either side of us, the grandiose statues standing out in sharp relief against the clear blue sky. We were passing a giant statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee when I heard the sound of gunfire from behind us.\n\nI spun around in my seat, my hand going to the concealed weapon at my side. The armored vehicles and chopper that had been pursuing us were still on our tail, their drivers intent on capturing us at any cost.\n\nShanice was shouting for Omar to speed up as he swerved to avoid obstacles and civilians. I could see the determination on Omar’s face in the rear-view mirror as he put the pedal to the metal, his driving skills pushed to the limit as he weaved between other vehicles and narrowly avoided collisions.\n\n“Just moments ago,” said the host on the radio, “we received troubling news about the British Broadcasting Network. Reports are coming in that BBN, the official news network of the British Empire, has abruptly stopped broadcasting. We are unsure at this time what has caused this sudden halt, but the situation appears to be serious. Rumors are already circulating about people hearing air sirens on BBN’s latest live broadcast, although nothing has been confirmed. We are also unable to get in touch with our London-based correspondent. Our attempts to reach her have been met with silence. This development only adds to the already tense situation in the Pacific. With the recent reports of a possible nuclear explosion in Hawaii, it’s unclear whether the cessation of BBN’s broadcasts is related to the ongoing conflict. Lady Margaret Russell has not yet issued a statement on the matter, and it’s unclear what steps they are taking to address the situation. As always, A-OK America will continue to provide you with up-to-date information on this developing—”\n\nAs we approached a tight turn, Omar slammed on the brakes and we skidded around the corner, the pursuing vehicles hot on our tail. I could hear the sound of metal scraping against metal as we collided with obstacles in our path, but Omar never slowed down. I could see a giant statue of Stonewall Jackson up ahead, his stern visage seeming to judge our desperate flight through the city. The CLEA vehicles were closing in. But just as it seemed we were out of options, Omar spotted an opportunity. He veered sharply off the main road and onto a narrow side street, the pursuing vehicles unable to follow as they were forced to slow down to navigate the tight turn. We shot down the alleyway, the sound of our engine echoing off the walls. Omar expertly navigated the tight corners and narrow passageways, keeping us one step ahead of our foes. Finally, we burst out onto a wider street, the sound of our pursuers fading into the distance behind us. I breathed a sigh of relief, but then the oddly shaped helicopter descended right in front of us, whipping up a thick cloud of dust and debris, and reducing our visibility to nearly zero. The noise was deafening as the helicopter descended, the whir of the blades slicing through the air like a razor-sharp knife.\n\nOmar brought our vehicle to a screeching halt, throwing the gears into reverse as we struggled to avoid colliding with the strange machine. The next thing we knew, we were surrounded by both CLEA and the police. For a few moments, we sat in silence as more and more officers arrived with their guns pointed at our vehicle. The only thing we heard was the radio, filling us with just as much dread as what was happening around us.\n\n“Just now, a video surfaced on the netway, showing what appears to be a missile launch from the state of Virginia. The video is grainy, and it’s difficult to make out the exact details, but it’s clear that these are some sort of long-range missiles being launched into the sky. I repeat, we have just received footage of a missile launch from Virginia. We do not know the intended target or the reason behind this launch, but we are working to get more information as soon as possible. Wait, hold on. We are receiving an Emergency Alert. Let me play this for you now.”\n\n*BEEP BEEP BEEP.*\n\n“This is an emergency alert. All residents within a 100-mile radius of the following cities: Richmond, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., are ordered to seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill. Take cover now. This is an emergency alert. All residents within a 100-mile radius of the following cities: Richmond, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., are ordered to seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill. Take cover—\"\n\n“Step out of the vehicle now!” yelled a uniformed man into a megaphone. “You’re surrounded and we will use force if necessary! This ends now!”\n\nOmar looked down at his dead friend, only sadness visible on his face, then he turned to us. “I’m truly sorry,” he said. “I don’t know what went wrong. This wasn’t supposed to happen. And now the world seems to be falling apart. Our journey ends here, my friends. Do you want to surrender?”\n\n“What difference would it make?” Shanice said. The emergency alert was still being broadcast, over and over and over again. “I’m so sorry, James.”\n\nI felt a lump in my throat as my heart sunk to my stomach. CLEA agents slowly approached us, their fingers ready on their triggers. All of a sudden, a deafening alarm cut through the air, drowning out the man with the megaphone and causing everyone to pause. The siren was unlike anything I had ever heard before—a deep, pulsing sound that seemed to vibrate through my bones. The agents and police officers around us looked confused, no doubt unaware of the breaking news. Then, a few of the police cars drove away, most likely disobeying their orders to stay put. The man with the megaphone turned around and shrugged. Someone beckoned him to return to the helicopter. For a few moments, people were frozen in confusion—awaiting orders or information—but then more and more of their vehicles began driving off and when the helicopter started its engines everyone panicked as if they all instantly understood what was approaching.\n\n“Drive,” Shanice said. “Drive! Drive! Drive!”\n\nOmar, as if jolted out of a reverie, quickly shifted the car into gear and sped away. No one paid any attention to us anymore. The officers still standing on the street just watched us as we drove past them. Further ahead, people were running for shelter while others remained sitting at restaurants and cafés as if waiting for everything to blow over. As we drove past an imposing building, I craned my neck to take a closer look. The marble dome of the structure was enormous and gleamed in the sun. The white columns of the facade rose high into the sky, and I could see a large Confederate flag flapping in the breeze. On the front lawn, there were several large black vehicles parked, and I could see people in gray uniforms hurrying toward them. A large helicopter was taking off from a pad, its blades churning the air and making a deafening sound. I guessed that it was their Capital building and thought about how in just a few minutes it would be reduced to rubble. For a second, I found some comfort in the thought of all of this being swept away by a radioactive blast wave, but then I thought of all the innocent people that would suffer, and my comfort turned into a deep sense of sorrow.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nOmar flung the door open to his house. He yelled for his wife and daughter, desperately and with tears running down his cheeks. At first, it didn’t look like anyone was home, but then Celine appeared in a doorframe, holding her doll close to her chest. Omar rushed up to her and picked her up in his arms.\n\n“My little girl,” he said and kissed her forehead. “Where’s Mommy?”\n\n“She went to the city to buy some food,” she said.\n\nAt that very moment, a light many times brighter than the sun flashed outside the window, blinding us. The sound that followed was deafening, like a thousand thunderclaps all at once. The house shook and debris rained down from the ceiling. Omar instinctively shielded Celine with his body, trying to protect her and I covered together with Shanice behind a sofa. Luckily, we were far enough away from the blast for the heat wave to not cause any serious harm, but the shockwave hit us hard, knocking us off balance. As we got up, we could hear the sound of shattered glass and the clattering of metal outside.\n\n“We have to get out of here,” I said, my voice barely audible over the ringing in my ears.\n\nOmar nodded, his eyes filled with fear and sorrow. He picked up Celine and motioned for us to follow him. We made our way through the rubble, careful to avoid stepping on any broken glass or sharp edges. As we stepped outside, we could see the mushroom cloud forming in the distance, its ominous shape rising up into the sky. Slowly, the blue sky from just moments ago was swallowed up by the smoke from the firestorm in the city and as the sun shone through it the landscape was colored a sickening shade of orange.\n\nOutside, the scene was one of complete devastation. Buildings were in ruins, cars were overturned and burning, and survivors were running in all directions, some screaming and crying, others silently staring at the destruction. Here, too, the air was thick with smoke and dust, and the smell of burning metal and chemicals filled our nostrils.\n\n“We need to find a way out of here,” I said, my voice trembling with fear. “We can’t stay here much longer, or the radiation will get us.”\n\nThe car we had come with was blocked by a tree that had fallen.\n\n“Omar,” said Shanice, “we need a new vehicle!”\n\nHolding Celine in his arms, he brought us to their garage. The car there was luckily unharmed by the blast.\n\n“But where do we go?” he asked, almost as if not fully there.\n\n“We’re going back to the crater on Rebel Route,” Shanice said. “It’s our only hope now. This world has nothing more to give.”\n\nOmar nodded absentmindedly. He told us to get in the car. I sat down next to him, while Shanice placed herself next to Celine in the backseat.\n\n“Are we going to get Mommy?” asked Celine. Omar froze in place, clearly unable to form the necessary words. “We need to go get her,” continued Celine, “she might not be able to find her way back home alone.”\n\nFinally, Omar turned to her. “We’ll try our best to find her, sweetie,\" he said, his voice barely above a whisper. \"But right now, we need to focus on getting to safety. Your mother wouldn’t want us to stay here and get hurt.\"\n\nCeline could see on her father’s face that he wasn’t telling her the truth, and she burst into tears. Her cries wracked through her tiny body, her sobs full of fear and loss. The tears streamed down her face, her chest heaving with each breath, as she clutched her doll tighter. Her heart was being ripped apart, and the weight of the world was crushing down on her small shoulders. Although she couldn’t understand it, she now knew she had lost the most important person in her life.\n\nOmar, now crying himself, leaned over the front seat and pressed his daughter’s hand. Shanice and I exchanged a pained look. And then Omar returned to the wheel and turned on the engine. As he did so, the radio came on. The emergency alert had been replaced by a female version of *Dixie’s Land*, undoubtedly the last song ever to be broadcasted in what now once was The Confederate States of America. Omar turned the radio off and slowly drove into the inferno outside.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe road was mostly empty, indicating how few had managed to escape the city before it was too late. The further away we got from Richmond, the clearer the sky became. Soon, though, the smoke would find its way here as well. Colossal pillars of smoke could be seen on the horizon no matter in what direction we looked, and they were all slowly but surely consuming the sky.\n\nWhen we arrived at the location, we approached the tents that had been set up around the meteor crater carefully. There was a man standing next to a police car, holding his Stetson hat and smoking a cigar. I immediately recognized him as Carlos. By now, it was clear he had been the one who told the AJS about our transport to Richmond. He shook Omar’s hand, expressing his regret when he noticed that Yolanda wasn’t with us.\n\n“I came down here soon after Richmond was hit,” he said. “Everyone’s gone. They all left. Most people in town left too. Someone said we were too close to the city… Something about the radiation. I was about to leave too, but I wanted to check this out first. And let me tell you, there’s something here that’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before.”\n\n“The crater?” I asked.\n\n“Let me show you,” he said and took a puff on his cigar.\n\nWe followed him toward the biggest tent, located where I expected the crater to be. And, just as I thought, it was there. Carlos walked up to the edge and beckoned us to join him.\n\n“My God,” said Shanice as she looked down into the hole. “It’s beautiful.”\n\nAt the bottom of it was a small pile of a strange material. The substance looked almost like a liquid, with a shimmering quality that seemed to change in the light. It was an otherworldly shade of violet, but as I looked closer, I realized that it seemed to contain bits of every color imaginable, as if they were all swirling together in an indescribable dance.\n\n“It’s making me nauseous,” I said. “I felt the same thing just before it hit the ground. It just feels off.”\n\n“This is our way back,” Shanice said. “It’s what brought us here, and I believe it can bring us back home.”\n\nI picked up a rock and threw it down the crater. Before it reached the bottom, it vanished. “It must be some kind of rift in reality.”\n\nShanice grabbed Omar by his shoulders. “Come with us! There will be a place for you and Celine there. We’ll find a way to integrate you into society. You’ll be free. And you too, Carlos. All we have to do is to jump down that hole and—”\n\n“I’ll stay,” Carlos said. “I have responsibility for the people left in town, and someone needs to stay to rebuild. Eventually, the dust will settle here. Or maybe it won’t, but I got to try. Besides, someone has to make sure this meteor doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.”\n\n“And you, Omar?” Shanice said. “Please, think of Celine.”\n\nOmar nodded in his typical way, then he shook Carlos’s hand. “Thank you, friend. I would’ve stayed and helped you rebuild, but I have to think about Celine. I need to do what’s best for her. This world has nothing but misery to offer her.”\n\nCarlos watched as the rest of us approached the edge of the crater, holding hands. Celine stood next to her father, holding her doll, still sobbing. Shanice counted to three, and then we jumped. As we fell through the rift, the world around us warped and twisted, colors blending and shapes distorting in a way that made me feel sick to my stomach. It was like being caught in the middle of a kaleidoscope, but a thousand times more intense. I closed my eyes and braced myself for impact, but when I opened them again, we were no longer falling.\n\n“Where are we?” asked Celine.\n\nI opened my eyes. We were all laying down on the ground. There was no crater here, just some grass. Next to us, there was some kind of probe that must have been sent through the rift from the other side. It had the Confederate flag painted on its side. Further away, I could see a road. We all got up on our feet and walked toward it. It didn’t take long for a car to stop for us.\n\n“This question might seem strange to you,” I said. “But is this The United States of America?”\n\nThe lady in the truck laughed. “Why, of course, it is! What happened to you people? Are you okay?”\n\nA smile appeared on Shanice’s face and tears formed in her eyes. “We were on our way to our honeymoon and… You know what, it’s a long story. Would you mind giving us a ride?”\n\n“I’m on my way to Richmond,” said the lady. “I can drop you off there.”\n\nI turned to Omar who held Celine in his arms. “Welcome to the United States of America. Prepare to see Richmond as you’ve never seen it before.”\n\nWe all crammed ourselves into the car. And as it drove away, we sat in silence—too tired to speak—as the car radio played *Survivor* by Destiny’s Child. Shanice rested her head on my shoulder, and—listening to the lyrics of the song—I somehow knew that everything would be all right from now on.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/)",

        "text": "I go inside. Put on my headset and pick up the controller. I switch on my console and queue for a game. The day behind me is a haze, but a few rounds of Dispatch will make me feel better.\n\nI play Dispatch most nights. Ok, every night. It’s the most popular game in the world. The company that created Dispatch, Elated, perfected remote cloud gaming. No matter where I am or how slow my connection is, I can play any game I like. Flawlessly.\n\nA few minutes in, I get some strange in-game messages. They’re not from anyone on my team:\n\nDavid. We don’t have much time. Drop your controller to the ground.\n\nThey call me by my name, not my screen name. That’s specific and weird, which intrigues me. What harm is there in dropping it to see what happens? What the heck, I’ll try it.\n\nMy character stops. Stupid spammers. But then, after a few seconds, my player starts moving. It runs, gets kills, changes weapons. My controller is still on the ground.\n\nThen I hear myself – me – speaking over the game’s voice chat.\n\n“Guys, are you also getting some lag?” That’s my voice. Then I hear myself yell “behind you!”\n\nI reply to the message:\n\nWhat the hell?\n\nThem:\n\nWe intervened in the code so you could see the truth: that Elated has an AI clone of you on their servers.\n\nThey never solved the latency problem, but they learned that decisions can be precisely predicted. So they bought all the data they could and used it to make AI clones of their entire player base.\n\nIt feels like you’re playing; making those choices. You’re actually just watching an AI clone of you playing against other AI clones. Cheaper and easier than optimizing latency.\n\nWith all that data plugged in, these AIs make the same decision as you at the same moment – the direction you’ll walk, when you’ll shoot, what you’ll say.\n\nI reply:\n\nIs this a prank?\n\nNo reply. The weirdness of it all takes me out of myself. I log off, have a drink, go to sleep.\n\nThe next day, a rep from Elated calls. She tells me a caching error caused my player to move without input. I don’t want to sound conspiratorial, so I go with it.\n\nBut it doesn’t sit right. I heard my voice speaking without me. If there’s any truth to this, people need to know. That’s why I was shown, right?\n\nI call a few journalists. One comes over to see it, but Dispatch no longer plays on its own.\n\nMy nights grow restless. If we make choices based purely on personal experiences, is the AI me conscious? Does it fear and hurt? Or is free will some deception of our gray matter; are our decisions precisely preordained based on previous actions, choices and events?\n\nEither way, Elated is selling me back to myself for $49 a month.\n\nI call the rep back to confront her. She denies the claims. I push. Put on hold. When she returns, she has a soothing tone. “It’s ok, David. We can address this.”\n\nThe doorbell rings while I’m still on the phone. Two people from Elated are there. They smile. They are extremely calm. Zen calm. They reassure me that what I saw can be explained and invite me to go with them to HQ. I agree, but I’m not entirely sure why – their demeanours are like a spell.\n\nI’m sitting outside a room with a sign on the door: AI Support &amp; Loose Ends. Someone in a lab coat calls me in. I expected a regular professional office, but I’m in a medical consultation room.\n\n“Sit on the exam table please, David. How are you feeling?”\n\n“Well, I don’t sleep properly because your company is…” I look around. “What is this?”\n\n“What did they tell you we’re doing?”\n\n“Who are you?”\n\n“I support the AIs.”\n\n“AIs?”\n\n“They got you in the game chat, right?”\n\n“What is this?”\n\n“Listen, David. They were right, but you weren’t duplicated in some dark server.”\n\n“I saw it. I heard myself. And you’ve trapped a—”\n\n“David,” a pause. “You’re the AI. You’re the clone. They were trying to tell you—” the doctor points to the ceiling “—about this.” They point at me. “Not you.”\n\n“If I wasn’t playing then who was?”\n\n“When AIs like yourself stop inputting, the you up there takes control. It’s laggy, but it’s just a failsafe. We’re improving the latency, but—”\n\n“Impossible. I have a job. A girlfriend.”\n\n“Exactly. You live a full life down here so we can perfectly replicate your choices up there.”\n\n“I remember being a kid, I remember my sister before she—”\n\n“This is tough, I know. But we need you.” They look me in the eye for a second. “Your tolerance was good last time.”\n\n“Last time?”\n\n“This has happened before, David.” They’re lying, right?\n\n“You don’t believe me.” The doctor spins around in their chair to face their computer. “Look at this.” They tap through several CCTV videos. I see myself sitting in the same room.\n\n“What if I tell people?”\n\n“Don’t worry about it.” That calming voice.\n\n“What do you—” A prick in my arm. The lights overwhelm me.\n\nI’m in the hallway outside my apartment.\n\nI go inside. Put on my headset and pick up the controller. I switch on my console and queue for a game. The day behind me is a haze, but a few rounds of Dispatch will make me feel better.",

        "text": "Proportionally, I’m the same. But I’m slowly being scaled down. It started an hour ago, and I’m already about a quarter of my original size. I have no idea what the *fuck* to do because I live in an isolated farmhouse. At this rate of diminishment, I’d be as minuscule as a mouse before I could reach anybody — or anybody could reach me.\n\nIt started with an asinine conversation online. Sitting on a lonely armchair in my lounge, I watched videos on my phone and fell into a state of festering frustration. Bitter at my solitude, I found myself embroiled in a needless debate. I accused a stranger of being rude to somebody else in the comment section of a YouTube video, and that nameless, faceless commenter replied:\n\n*So, you think you’re the bigger person? Not for long.*\n\nAn excruciating ache tore through my body. I watched in horror as my flesh started to ripple and crinkle, like crumpling paper. My bones groaned in searing agony, and I shrieked as my body started to shrink.\n\nDrowning in the dwindling sands of time, I found the following information in the about section of the user’s YouTube page:\n\n*Rita’s email address for enquiries: \\[——\\]*\n\nAlready struggling to reach every letter on the phone keyboard, I emailed Rita to ask what was happening. Half an hour of painfully terrifying — and terrifyingly painful — shrinking passed. Then the wicked woman replied:\n\n*Struggling to type with such tiny fingers, Ant-Man? You should be more afraid of the things you’ll see when you shrink into the carpet.*\n\nI’m no microbiologist, so I leapt onto Google to research what things lurk at the unseen levels of reality. Monstrosities far more horrifying than the ones we see at the macro level. [Just take a look](https://uk.pcmag.com/electronics/36080/10-creepy-but-amazing-microscopic-monsters) at the terrors that are going to devour me when I disappear into that tiny world.\n\nI begged Rita for forgiveness, and a cure for my terrible affliction, but she ignored my pleas and derived sadistic pleasure from my ceaseless suffering.\n\n*You should fear the things that the monsters fear, little man. Every creature in the micro realm is hunted by the shadow. And now you’ve caught his attention.*\n\nAs I typed my response, I saw the light from my living room lamp traversing my walls in strange ways — the walls that had become towering skyscrapers. I steadily shrank atop the screen of my phone, which was resting on the floor, and watched a shadowy figure dance across my faded green wallpaper. My heart jittered in terror.\n\nAn eerie moan sounded from the carpet. I crawled along my phone screen, trembling as I prepared myself for whatever horrors I would face on the other side. As I peered over the edge of the phone, I screamed at the blackness between the carpet fibres. For a fleeting moment, I thought I saw an empty face observing me from the void.\n\nI can’t explain it. As I continue to shrink, which seems to be increasingly painful, it’s as if I see the world through a different lens. Not just a smaller one — a darker one. Am I seeing the world in its real state? Who knows? I don’t have time to figure this out. It’s becoming harder and harder to type. I’m running from letter to letter on the phone keyboard at this point.\n\nI suppose I could avoid the carpet and stay on the screen, but microscopic creatures live on every surface, so it doesn’t matter where I go. What fate awaits me in those carpeted chasms? Should I fear the monsters beneath me or the one hiding in the shadows?\n\nIf you have suggestions that could help, thank you. However, I should warn you that I think it would be a fruitless endeavour. I wouldn’t expect a reply. I don’t even know how much longer I’ll be able to keep typing.\n\nIt’s too late to save me. Soon, I’ll be lost in the world within my carpet fibres. A world that, by the looks of it, is far more dangerous than the one we know. And if I survive the monsters, I have to face the frightful, formless shadow stalking me.\n\nAs I shrink, my microphobia grows. \n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "The room was dark and cold as I stepped inside. The air smelled musty like it had been closed up for years. It wasn't until I got to the kitchen that I realized how long ago this place might have actually been abandoned. There were still dishes piled high in the sink with dried food stuck between them. A box full of moldy cereal sat next to an empty bottle of milk. On top of the fridge there was a note written by someone named \"Molly.\" She said she would be back soon but didn't explain why or when. I don't know what happened to her after that because I never saw another sign of life again. As far as I knew, I was alone here. That's not entirely true though. Every night at midnight something else wakes up. Something hungry. And every morning you can find me lying face down in a pool of blood.\n\nI'd just finished cleaning out all the old food from the refrigerator before I noticed the smell. My first thought was rotting meat. Then I heard it. From outside. Some kind of growling sound. At least two voices joined together in unison. They weren't human. Not even close. Whatever they were made their way through the window without making any noise. Their claws scratched against the glass as if trying to get inside.\nI grabbed one of the knives from the countertop and ran toward the front door. I could see movement behind the curtains but nothing came through the windows. Maybe whatever it was couldn't fit? Or maybe it only comes out during the day? Either way, I needed to get away while I still could.\n\nI opened the front door slowly so as not to make too much noise. When I did, I found myself staring right into its eyes. Its body was covered in thick black fur. Two small horns grew above each eye. One red, one blue. Both pointed straight ahead. This thing looked more beast than anything else. It let out a low growl which seemed to shake the very walls around us. Before I could react, it jumped forward and knocked me over onto the floor. It landed on top of me, pinning me under its weight. It growled louder now, almost laughing at me. I tried kicking it off but it wouldn't budge. All I managed to do was scratch my leg up pretty bad. But then suddenly it stopped moving completely. For some reason, I felt safe underneath it. Like we were both waiting for something. After a few seconds, I started to hear footsteps coming closer. Someone was walking towards our home.\nWhen whoever it is finally arrived, he stood directly across from where I lay. He wore a hooded robe similar to mine. Only his was white instead of gray. His arms hung limp at his sides. Even though he appeared to be standing perfectly still, I could tell he was breathing heavily. He kept glancing over to the creature beneath him. Finally, he spoke.\n\"What…what is going on?\"\nI wanted to answer him but the words caught in my throat. Instead, I simply stared at him.\n\"Why isn't it dead yet?\" he asked.\n\nHe turned around and walked past me. I watched him go upstairs. Just moments later, I heard a loud bang followed by screaming. It sounded like Molly. The guy went downstairs and pulled the monster off me. I scrambled to my feet and ran outside. By the time I reached the porch, the screams had cut off. I climbed up the stairs and entered the living room. What greeted me was a scene straight out of hell itself. The man was kneeling beside the woman's corpse. Blood dripped from his hands and stained the carpet below. The monster was nowhere to be seen. In fact, none of the furniture had been touched. Everything was exactly as it should have been. Except for the bloody knife laying on the ground next to the couch.\n\nI approached the man cautiously. \"Are you okay?\" I asked.\nHe didn't respond.\n\"Hey,\" I said. \"Are you alright?\"\nStill nothing.\n\"What happened?” I said again.\nFinally, he responded. \"She woke up.\"\n\"Who woke up?\" I asked.\n\"The lady. Her name's Molly. She was my girlfriend. A few years ago we broke into this house and found a strange spell books.” He replied.\n\"So what does molly have to do with the beast?\" I inquired.\n\"We were just bored and ended up doing some of the incantations.\" He said.\n\"So you summoned the beast?\" I asked.\n\"We released some kind of demon, it possessed molly, she is the beast.” He responded gently.\nDeftly i spoke. \"So wait...you're saying you just killed your own girlfriend?\"\nHe nodded his head. \"Yes. I did kill her. I had to. Had to make up for leaving her here like a coward.\"\n\"That’s honestly really rough man but what about the demon?” I asked with as much tact as I could muster.\n“It’s spirit lingers in this house, I’m going to burn the place down.” He answered surely.\nSurprised I shouted out. “Hold up man this is my house you can’t be serious, isn’t there another way?”\n“Are you an idiot? There is no time we must finish this while we can, before anyone else has to die.” He retorted quickly.\n“Your right, let’s do this.” I reply after a moment of silence.\n“Good, there’s gasoline in my car outside let’s get started.” He says.\n\nI ran down the steps and headed toward the garage. The man followed closely behind. We emptied several cans and returned to the house. Once inside, we lit everything on fire. The flames quickly spread throughout the entire structure. Quietly one could hear demonic anguish as fire truck sirens began to blare. Soon enough, the whole neighborhood was alerted to the situation.\nI stayed in the kitchen watching the inferno. The man sat down next to me. \"You really think that will work?\"\n\"Hope so… and I’m sorry about your friend.\" I said.\nHe nodded. \"Me too. She was nice.”\n“What’s your name if you don’t mind?” I asked.\n\"I'm Sam.\" He replied.\n\"Nice to meet you Sam. I’m Mike.\" I said with a smile.",

        "text": "It was on a normal Friday night, me and my friends had planned to go to this new club that had opened in our town. The night started out fun we had some drinks and then as we were dancing I wanted to catch my breath so I went to the counter and right next to me was this beautiful girl sitting alone having a drink, I said hi and she told me her name(let's call her Maria) we started small talk then I asked her to dance and she said yes.\n\n\nAs we were walking to the dance floor I held her hand and it felt cold I didn't think about it much because she was drinking cold beer and I thought it was because she was holding a cold bottle. Fast forward we danced and had fun and then she said she wanted to go home so I offered to give her a ride home as we were walking to the car our hands touched and it was cold as earlier but I didn't think about it much cause I thought she was cold and I gave my jacket to her, we chatted a little bit but she didn't tell me more about her and I just thought she was trying to be mysterious.\n\n\n We reached her home and I walked her to the front door and she kissed me and said goodbye to me as I walked back to my car. Fast forward the next day I remembered that I didn't get her number but because I wanted to see her again I just made up an excuse to go and see her and I would tell her I came to pick up my jacket although I didn't care about it rather I just wanted to get her number. I remembered the place so I just drove there and knocked on the front door, an older woman opened and I asked if Maria was home, the woman just froze and then her eyes were filled with tears, she invited me in the house and as I sat down she asked me how I knew Maria and then I told her that I met her last night, she was confused and said that she thought I was her daughter Maria's friend who didn't know that she died a year ago and I explained to her that last night I dropped off a girl by her front door and she had told me her name was Maria, the woman then went to bring a few pictures of her deceased daughter Maria and explained that she only lived there with her husband and no one else.\n\nLooking at a picture I froze and felt all the hair on my body stand because the dead daughter of the woman looked exactly like the girl I was with last night, I started thinking to myself \"this is a prank right?\" I told the woman that the girl in the picture was the one I brought home last night then the woman started getting angry because she thought I was doing a sick prank to her, after I explained everything she said she wanted to show me something and we got in my car and I followed all her directions then we reached a cemetery as we were walking through the graveyard I noticed something that made me shiver, my jacket was on top of a gravestone which the mother pointed out as Maria's grave. It's been a whole month now and everyday I still think about what happened to me that night, I don't know if I am ever going to a club again.",

        "text": "\n\nI live in a big house, not something fancy or expensive, but because it is still too much trouble going to all the places to see if everything is alright. \n\nAnd this became ten times worse if I had to check the front yard or the back yard every time. So to save time and energy I just had to get dogs. Not just pet dogs, but actual guard dogs. The big and scary ones that no one dares to challenge. \n\nIn my small town, there aren't that many shelters and even fewer that have big dogs. So getting them was very difficult and unfortunately, at the time now I think if I had any bigger or meaner... I don't want to think about it. In the end, I got two Golden Retrievers.\n\nNot the most fretting dog, but is the training that makes the personality, not the breed. At least that was what I thought. Not even one week after I got them, my house was invaded. They got everything thing, except those stupid dogs that did nothing, but stare at me with their goofy smile like everything was fine.\n\nThen I got online to find a good dog trainer. For the three months after I got trainer after trainer and they did nothing. My dogs were just as stupid and useless as ever, if not even worse.\n\nThen I head to the internet one last time and come across a suspicious website. It was \" From pet to killer\", now offline of course. I was desperate so even this shady website was appealing and in the worst case, it would be just a scam or at else. After some time I made contact with one guy and he promised me \"They will protect their territory in one month or your money back\". We exchanged info and he said he would take a day to come.\n\nAfter a long waiting, he finally got to my home and he said.\n\n\"This will take the whole day and I need to be with them alone. So you may as well enjoy your day.\"\n\nNow I thought this was strange just like anyone who come across my telling. But I had to work and the worst he could do was rob my dogs, and then I would have an excuse for getting new and better dogs.\n\nAfter that long day of work when I arrived home, they were still as dumb and naive as ever. I just said mentally \"another one that can't do shit.\" But I found a letter in one of their leashes ( they don't have names, I just didn't give a crap about them.) It was written.\n\n\" Just give Baal and Lucy here a chance.\"\n\n\"So you have names now... Whatever...\"\n\nIn the middle of that night, I had a strange dream about being hunted down by two big golden figures, with sharp and long teeth. It felt like I was being reaped apart with every second the pain was getting worse and worse.\n\nI got up at the usual time and when I was checking the house, I found a small mouse dead. It was weird, no animals come to my home, and even fewer to die on. Then I look at Baal and Lucy. ( they now have names, might as well use them.)\n\n\"I don't think you guys could protect the house even from a small rodent-like this one.\"\n\nI went to my job next without giving it any more thought. I really should have. The next few days were the same as usual, until one day I had a weird dream just like the other one, but the golden figures were even bigger and meaner, their eyes were burning with passion and hostility. Just like predators hunting. They toss me from side to side like I was a toy. Every second was very painful, but not enough to wake me up.\n\nI woke up in a pond of my own sweat, I was dirty and completely out of my mind. It took me a few seconds to regain my normal and calm self. Then I proceed with my normal routine, everything was fine and in a moment it was like time frozen in place. I looked at the front yard and... There it was just a rat in my yard... Dead... But it was different... It had bite marks. Oblivious to my previous feeling I for the first time congratulate both Baal and Lucy. This was an error and just made me fear for my life now.\n\nSome time passed by until one day I come home to the greeting of a dead possum. It wouldn't be possible to know it was a possum if it wasn't for the little piece of jaw bone it was left behind and my knowledge of biology. At that moment I actually felt fear. I reluctantly look at Baal just to check if it was them. And there it was small amounts of blood and possum fur. And the worst part... It wasn't like they were wasting it... It was like it was there to show me what they have done.\n\n\nThis time I didn't celebrate them protecting my house. I just ran inside and wait for my unease to cease. This was the only right move I have pulled so far. \n\nEvery day that passed forward I felt more and more nervous about what both Baal and Lucy could do. I made the decision of the next time they kill something to call a friend that knows about dogs to help me out and the next night to my decision I had another dream.\n\nThis time the figures were clear to see... They were dogs... Golden Retrievers to be precise made me realize what is happening, I wasn't dreaming I was hearing the animal crying for help and I was materializing in my subconscious and this time it was way...WAY worse. Baal and Lucy weren't just hunting me, or the animals in this case, they were actually torturing the animal.\n\nI woke up crying that day, which isn't normal. I am not the type to have empathy, but that felt so real and so excruciating. I immediately contact my friend and called sick to work.\n\nAfter two hours with panic in my eyes, I hear her coming. It was a relief really, but a feeling was telling me this wasn't right. I then before greeting her would check both Baal and Lucy and they weren't growling or barking. They weren't moving, they were standing still and waiting for something to happen. Just then I realize and immediately scream to stop.\n\n\"DON'T COME NEAR!\"\n\nShe put a step back just at the right moment so Baal couldn't catch her leg. Then she scolded me.\n\n\"What- What the fuck was that! WHY THE HELL DID YOU TEACH THAT!\"\n\n\"That is the thing I didn't.\"\n\nAfter that, I don't know how but I made Baal and Lucy quiet and convinced my friend to come inside. We proceed to talk and she explained to me that she never had seen something like this even in her long year in the shelter.\n\n\" We did have aggressive dogs, but nothing so extreme. It is like they were possessed by something.\"\n\nThen it clicked. I rapidly sent her away and made sure that Baal and Lucy would touch her. Before I could go check on the guy who trained them I saw what was keeping me awake that night, it was a stray cat. \n\nNow I know they are aiming for bigger things. I had to check if the guy was near or if any information on him at all would help a lot. And just my luck, everything is gone. The Contact, his number, and the site. Fuck even my own memories of the guy are as cold as hell.\n\nMy friend come here two days ago and if it wasn't because I had to restock food I think this would even be posted. Ever since she was here I haven't slept or gone to work all because I am fearing they will come for me next, but I had to get food and a lot! So in my one out of the house, Baal and Lucy made the worst thing possible. \n\nWhen I was just getting back I saw a guy calling for his dog. I know that guy is from my neighborhood and I know he had Rottweiler almost the size of a wolf, Rottweiler was almost two times the size of Baal and Lucy. But as there's a saying in Brazil \"I'm small, but not half. You're big, but not two.\" In my case, they were actually small and two. I knew, for whatever reason, that his Rottweiler wasn't coming back, but I checked nonetheless and there they were chewing on some dogs' bones. I am just glad I didn't hear the Rottweiler's screams.\n\nI rushed inside feeling safe. Or at least safer than being outside. But the guy from earlier called the cops and they decided to come near my house. That was when I made my worst decision. \n\n\"DON'T COME HERE! YOU WILL BE KILLED!\"\n\nYeah. I scream to cops that they would be killed if they come near... I'm a fucking genius. They obviously come and the moment the first one put their feet in the front yard Lucy ripped their leg. The other cop could have just killed my dogs and made my life easier forever. But just as terrified as I was by the first cop's screams, this other cop couldn't do anything but froze and scream.\n\nNow I'm in the middle of my living room in fetal position writing this with fear of ever taking a step outside.",

        "text": "Imagine; There's a table in the center of your room it's a normal table, wooden and sturdy. Now imagine the 4th dimension, pretty hard to imagine right?\n\nI was going to visit my family in New Mexico, they lived in the rural parts of Albuquerque. I was on my way there but I decided to stop at a hotel because it was 10:00 pm, the flight here was long so I just decided to stop to find a hotel and stay the night.\n\nI went up to the pretty big glass doors and I went inside and rang the bell, a minute later a young man came in and asked me; \"Welcome to ###### hotel, would you like to book a room?\" \"Yes please.\" \"Alright... Ah, here it is ehh, room 27!\" \"thank you\"\n\nI went up the stairs to the 2nd floor and there I found my room, as soon as I got in and put my bag down and fell right asleep on the bed...\n\nI woke up to a semi loud sound around 2:43 am, I got up and I instinctively grabbed my service handgun, I was working for the Milwaukee police.\n\nAnyways I got up and looked around the room, the source of the noise led me to a table I squatted down and looked, and saw nothing.\n\nAs I was going back to bed I saw in the corner of my eye, there were legs beneath the table and I panicked I got up again this time looking again under the table only to find nothing.\n\nI went around the table and in some points I could see the legs, like in the front I could not see, but then when I looked from the right side, clear as day I could see the legs of a creature.\n\nAt this point the creature was coming out of the table and I jolted to the front door I pulled the door open and ran to my rental car.\n\nI then sped off to my parents house, I banged on their door and my dad came out holding a shotgun.\n\"Sonny, weren't you supposed to stay at the hotel?\"\n\"Yeah, no, dad I, there's something seriously wrong at the hotel.\"\n\"What do you mean sonny?\"\nAt this point I didn't even know what to say, I saw something come out under the table but could that just have been a trick of the sleep deprived mind of a working officer? \n\"I, Nothing dad, can I stay the night?\"\n\"Yeah of course sonny, you want tea?\"\n\"Nah dad, I'm fine. I'm just tired.\"\n\"Alright, come in before you catch a darn cold.\"\n\nHad the thing I've seen been real? Or am I just too tired?\nI mean I've been working 16 hours a day.\nYeah, that's it, I'm just tired.\n\n\"Well here's your old bedroom, kept the things the way it was.\"\n\n\"It looks like the way it was, Thanks pops.\" \n\n\"Well goodnight sonny, see you tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Goodnight pops.\" \n\nI'm just tired. I'm just tired. \nThose words were like a mantra to me, and I dosed off.\n\nOnly to be awoken to my old wardrobe creaking and to my horror it was the same monster. \n\nit followed me to my only safe space, it got inside of my wardrobe.\n\nthe thing took one step, then two steps then it was grabbing a hold of me. it tried to drag me into the wardrobe but I resisted, just as I was about to scream the creature grabbed a hold of my mouth and forced it shut breaking my jaw at the same time.\n\nThis time the creature yanked really hard and I heard a popping sound coming from my elbow.\n\nThen I passed out.\n\nMy dad had heard the commotion and ran to my bedroom, he most likely saw the thing and got my handgun from the bedside table and shot at the thing.\n\nI then woke up in the hospital. and I remembered I don't have parents. I live in Russia. how did i end up in New Mexico...",

        "text": "Our family has a weird superstition, albeit I do not believe in it, nor do I abide by it. Superstitions strike me as lazy excuses for certain events that one cannot explain or comprehend. But I never knock on someone’s belief; it’s not for me, simple. One superstition that bothers me a lot is the Balloon man. Or the Balloon guy, or the Balloon reaper. I like to believe it’s just a hooded, mystical entity holding a red balloon, instead of a scythe. But instead of using the scythe to cut a person’s ties to life, he just pops the balloon with his skeletal fingers. I think that’s accurate enough of a description- or at least my younger self thought so. I conjured that image to reassure myself that no such entity exists, that it was just another old wives’ tale. I remember, my grandmother used to tell me that the Balloon man would just show up and be visible to the person whose death was near. His appearance was an omen of sorts, a reminder that death was right around the corner. \n\n\n\nThe next part she told used to crack me up, and it still does. She told that when the time arrives, the person hears a ‘POP’ and that’s when you know that your time alive is over. This phenomenon spanned through generations in our family, and it crossed through her as well. I remember her telling my mother that she had heard it and that she was not afraid of it. She also told mom that she knew his identity, but I could not hear her over the loud noises of my cousins in the adjacent room. I did not give it much thought, dispelling it as an old lady’s ramblings. Insensitive, yet warranted to some degree. At her funeral, she had a very shocked expression on her face. Almost as if she didn’t believe something that was in front of her. The same expression one would have if they were told their son or daughter was responsible for a heinous crime. Weird comparison, but I hope you get the gist. I only found it weird when my grandfather, my uncle, and my father died with the same expression on their faces. \n\n\nAll of their eyes had this certain sadness and a familiar dread. Mom had told me that Dad heard a ‘POP’ the day before his heart attack. So did my uncle, who passed away due to a stroke, and my grandfather who fell down the stairs. I was queasy, as any normal person would be if three of their relatives would pass away hearing the same sound. I lived twenty years without thinking and talking about it, and now, as I sit on my mother’s bed as she takes her last few breaths, my mind is blank. My mind is blank because of what she told me two days ago. \n\n\n\n“Oh my god, it’s been you all this time.” Tears ran down her cheeks. Even now, she cried herself to sleep, whimpering. I did not understand her, nor do I want to. I don’t want to spend her last days figuring out what she meant. All I want to do is stay by her side, and hope. \n\n\n\nIt’s been 10 years since Mom died. I remember her having an internal struggle of wanting to push me away as she was dying, but her motherly love was holding her back from completely severing ties. \n\n\n\nI am 70 years old and her words ring in my ears to this day. Only, now do I understand what she meant. Ever since being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, I was waiting. I was waiting for my balloon to pop. Only it didn’t. It never did. Instead, I was shown what I truly am. I am writing this standing before a mirror, and all I can see is my reflection. Patchy hair, drooped skin on my chin, unshaved beard, bags under my eyes. And a balloon floating behind me. A red balloon with a string floating by my shoulder, following me everywhere I go. I don’t know how I will die, but I understand now. I am the omen.",

I stumbled to the bathroom to brush my teeth, but as I looked in the mirror I noticed something strange. My skin looked paler than usual, and my eyes seemed to be sunken in.\n\nI shook my head, thinking it was just my imagination. I showered and washed the wound on my arm, which had almost healed, aside from being a bit red and crusty. I dressed quickly in a cute pink tracksuit and headed to school. Despite feeling tired, I thought to myself how normal I felt through the first half of the school day.\n\nBut as I walked into the school cafeteria for lunch, something strange happened. I caught a whiff of the cafeteria's meatloaf, and my mouth started watering. It wasn't just a normal hunger pang, though. I felt like I could almost taste the meatloaf in my mouth, like it was the most delicious thing I had ever smelled. *But I’m vegan* I thought, disgusted. Then I did something very abnormal and got the meatloaf for lunch.\n\nAs I sat down with my friends, I couldn't help but stare at the meatloaf on my tray. It looked so...appetizing. I picked up the entire gray slab with my fork and took a bite, relishing the taste of the savory, juicy meat. My friends looked at me in shock. \"Maggie, are you feeling okay?\" My BFF Sarah asked.\n\nI blinked, coming back to reality. \"Huh? Oh, sorry. I guess I'm just really hungry today.\"\n\nBut deep down, I knew it was something more than that. I had never felt such an intense craving for meat before, especially not something as bland as school cafeteria meatloaf. As the day wore on, my strange side effects only got worse. I couldn't stop thinking about the taste of human flesh because the scent lingered everywhere, even though I knew it was disgusting and wrong. I tried to push the thoughts out of my head, but they kept creeping back in.\n\nBy the end of the school day I was a nervous wreck. I knew I had to talk to Uncle Jerry about what was happening to me, but I was afraid of what he would say. As I walked home from school, I felt like I was being followed. I looked over my shoulder, but there was no one there. I quickened my pace, feeling a sense of unease wash over me.\n\nJust as I was about to turn the corner, a hand reached out and grabbed my shoulder. I screamed, spinning around to face my attacker. It was just my friend, Sarah.\n\n\"Oh my god, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to scare you like that.\"\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm down. \"It's okay, Sarah. You just caught me off guard. What's up?\"\n\nSarah looked at me with concern. \"I don't know, Maggie. You've been acting really weird lately. Are you feeling okay?\"\n\nI shook my head. \"No, I'm not. I think something's wrong with me. I need to talk to my Uncle Jerry.\"\n\nSarah nodded, putting a comforting arm around my shoulder. \"Okay, let's go. We'll figure this out together.\"\n\nAs we walked towards Uncle Jerry's lab, a run-down building hidden away from the road, a building that looked almost paranormally bigger on the inside than it did on the outside, I was feeling worse by the second, and I knew that I needed to get help from my uncle as soon as possible. But as we walked deeper into the woods, my hunger intensified. I could smell something delicious, and it wasn't the meatloaf from lunch.\n\nSniffing the air, I followed the scent to Sarah's neck. She gave me a worried look as my stomach growled, and I felt a sudden urge to pounce on my friend. Without warning, I grabbed Sarah by the arm and dragged us off the road and into the trees. Sarah protested, but I was too hungry to listen.\n\n\"What are you doing, Maggie? Why did you pull me out here?\" Sarah asked, her voice shaking. My eyes glazed over as I leaned in and sniffed Sarah's neck.\n\n\"You smell so good, Sarah. Like...like a juicy steak.\" Sarah recoiled in horror.\n\n\"Maggie, what the hell? You're scaring me.\" My hunger overtook me, and I lunged at Sarah, biting down hard on her neck. I felt the flesh give way, the blood filling my mouth. I was so hungry that I kept biting, my teeth sinking deeper and deeper into her neck.\n\nSuddenly, Sarah's head popped off her body, and blood spurted out. I was so startled that I stumbled back, still clutching the severed head in my hands. But then, something strange happened. Sarah's head began to twitch and squirm, and I realized that I had turned my friend too.\n\n\"Sarah, oh my god, I'm so sorry!\" I exclaimed, trying to connect the head back onto the body.\n\nBut it was too late. Sarah's head had already reanimated, and she was looking up at me with reddening, hungry eyes.\n\n\"Don't worry about it, Maggie. It's not like I was using my body anyways,\" Sarah's head quipped.\n\nI stared at Sarah's decapitated head in shock.\n\n\"Sarah, how are you...talking? And... why do you sound so calm about this?\"\n\nSarah shrugged my shoulders, or at least, the mangled stump where my shoulders used to be.\n\n\"I don't know, man. I guess turning into a zombie kind of changes your perspective on things.\"\n\nI shook my head, still reeling from what had just happened.\n\n\"Okay, we need to get rid of your body. But how do we do that?\"\n\nSarah's head grinned wickedly. \"I have an idea. You just have to trust me.\"\n\nWith Sarah's head in my backpack, we made our way to a secluded lake on the outskirts of town. My heart was racing, and Sarah's body was hidden in a large trash bag. As we approached the water's edge, I felt a sense of dread. This was it. We were really going to dispose of Sarah's body.\n\n\"Are you ready for this, Sarah?\" I asked, my voice trembling.\n\n\"As ready as a disembodied head can be,\" Sarah's head replied, her tone light but with a hint of sadness.\n\nI took a deep breath and heaved the bag over my shoulder, wading into the water until it was up to my chest.\n\n\"Here goes nothing,\" I muttered, and tossed the bag as far as I could into the water.\n\nFor a moment, the bag floated on the surface before slowly sinking beneath the waves. Sarah's head and I watched in silence as the bag disappeared from sight. I couldn't shake the feeling that we had just crossed a line we could never go back from.\n\n\"You know, Maggie,\" Sarah's head said suddenly. \"I don't think I ever told you this, but I always admired your bravery. Even before all of this happened, you were always the one to stand up to bullies and speak your mind.\"\n\nI was surprised by the sudden compliment.\n\n\"Thanks, Sarah. I never really thought about it like that.”\n\n\"Well, you're the bravest person I know,\" I said to Sarah's head, feeling a hint of emotion in my voice.\n\n\"And I'm proud to have you as my friend.\"\n\nA lump formed in my throat as Sarah's head responded, \"I'm proud to have you as my friend too, Maggie.\"\n\nWe stood in silence for a few more moments, watching the water ripple. Finally, I spoke up.\n\n\"Come on, Sarah. Let's go back to Uncle Jerry's house. I need to get home and wash my uniform for cheer practice tomorrow.\"\n\nSarah's head chuckled. \"I don't think they make cheerleading uniforms for decapitated heads.\"\n\nDespite the horror that had taken over my life, I couldn't help but laugh at Sarah's joke. It provided a moment of relief.\n\nWe arrived at Uncle Jerry's house still reeling from what had happened. We knew we had to tell Uncle Jerry the truth about how Sarah died.\n\nUncle Jerry looked up from his workbench as I came through the door. \"Is everything okay?\"\n\nI took a deep breath and sat down my backpack, unzipping it to reveal Sarah's head.\n\n\"We need your help, Uncle Jerry. Something terrible happened. I accidentally killed Sarah.\"\n\nUncle Jerry's eyes widened in shock. \"What? How?\"\n\nI explained what had happened, tears streaming down my face. The guilt was almost too much to bear. Uncle Jerry put a hand on my shoulder, trying to comfort me.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Maggie. That's a terrible thing to have to go through.\"\n\nI nodded, feeling a little bit better knowing that Uncle Jerry understood how I was feeling. Uncle Jerry pulled out a vial of liquid.\n\n\"I've got an idea. If one dose worked for almost 24 hours, we can just try more. It should last longer, maybe even several days at a time. I'm still working out the dosage.\"\n\nI looked at the vial, feeling hopeful. \"Will it work?\"\n\nUncle Jerry shrugged. \"It's not a guarantee, but it should give you enough time to participate in the competition before the transformation sets in.\"\n\nSarah's head and I both let out a sigh of relief. \"Thank you, Uncle Jerry,\" I said, feeling grateful for his help.\n\nUncle Jerry gave me and Sarah the injections, although he had to give Sarah’s dosing a momentary thought since she no longer had a body. This time, I thankfully didn't become unconscious. Uncle Jerry warned me about possible side-effects again.\n\n\"I can handle it,\" I said, determined to make it through the competition.\n\nSarah's head nodded in agreement.\n\n\"We've got this, Uncle Jerry,\" I said.\n\nUncle Jerry smiled at us. \"I believe you do. But you need to be careful. The medication won't last forever. Although you could be helping millions of people by allowing me to experiment... I mean, by testing out this drug for me.\"\n\nSarah's head and I exchanged a worried glance, realizing the enormity of what we were facing.\n\n\"We will, Uncle Jerry,\" I said, trying to sound confident. \"We have a competition to win.\"\n\nUncle Jerry nodded, looking at us with pride. \"I have faith in you, Maggie. Now go out there and kick some butt.\"\n\nAs I stepped out the door to go home, Uncle Jerry gifted me a small machete. \"Try to stay out of the dark this time, kiddo,\" Uncle Jerry said.\n\nOn the walk my eyes began to water and burn because the light seemed so bright. I took Sarah's head home in my backpack. I said hello to my dad, told him I’d eaten dinner already at Uncle Jerry’s and went straight to my room, exhausted from just surviving the day. I turned on a cheerleading podcast and sat in the dark, propping Sarah's head up on a pillow. The tips of my fingers and toes are tingling which is starting to worry me. I'm going to stay here until the morning. I can't risk being around too many people.\n\nI don’t know how I’m going to explain Sarah's absence tomorrow, and I hope nobody saw us walking together.",

To any who harbour growing concern, ease your hearts. I will not lie and say that I now feel safe, for I don’t believe this to be true. But I am not in any direct danger, I do not see the harm or mutilation I’ve seen here to await me.\n\nI plan to leave tomorrow. Just being in this place is having an effect on me, one which I no longer desire to experience.\n\nBut, I fear that I will leave here alone. Fear, no… perhaps that isn’t the right word. Maybe the word for this feeling hasn’t yet been conceived of. In any case, I don’t like it. I don’t like it here.\n\n.\n\nAnnie and I managed to get some sleep. In fact, the beds provided were quite comfortable, with linen spreads and woollen pillows to rest our heads.\n\nYet, I was awoken by something during the early hours. My eyes flickered open, but there was nothing noticeable at first that could have caused this. I had no need to use a restroom, nor was I thirsty. I searched for what could have possibly roused me for a while, until I realised what had been there since I’d re-emerged from sleep.\n\nA low harmony of uncountable tones sang out from somewhere. I felt in particular that it came from somewhere above us, but with how the frequencies merged and separated, interwove then unwound, made it difficult to pinpoint.\n\nI had no worry, not at first.\n\nBut the longer I listened, the more my mind became in-tune with the soothing vibrations, the less I found my ability to think clearly. My train of thought was constantly derailed, or switched lanes, without my conscious choice. The thoughts, musings, they became disordered, and often felt as if they were not my own.\n\nIt was when I began to make out… voices, for lack of a better term. Not those you would hear spoken, travelling as molecular vibrations in the air. They were better described as how one might “hear” their internal monologue.\n\nOnly, the words and ideas conveyed were foreign, unfamiliar. They were not mine. I can’t recall anything distinct with how they overlapped, becoming one and then separate again in an endless chain of order struggling against entropy.\n\nI suddenly considered the notion that if I listened for too long, they would replace my own internal self entirely. That idea terrified me more than anything had before, and I was quick to dive back under the covers, and fold the pillow tightly around my head.\n\nThe relentless cognitive noise settled, and I found sleep again.\n\nI was disturbed once again, this time with faint orange rays pouring in through the gaps between pillars. Unlike before, I immediately registered that a sound had woken me, and I shot up into a sitting position to see that Annie had done the same.\n\nStanding at the door, holding it open, was Domimokah.\n\n“I hope you have found rest this night. I have brought some things to refresh the both of you, that I feel you will enjoy.”\n\nHe carried with him a large wooden tray, which held two steaming earthenware cups, and an assortment of fresh foods. I shot Annie an inquisitive glance, and her returned expression agreed the sentiment.\n\nExcuse my French, but the food was *fucking delicious*. I don’t think I’ve ever had a more fulfilling breakfast in my life, and even now I strive to be able to cook a morning meal that could even begin to rival it.\n\nThe cups held some kind of herbal tea, which invigorated my body and cured any lingering tiredness from my interrupted sleep. We ate cheeses, bread, fruits and vegetables, the likes of which had never blessed my tongue with such wonders.\n\nMy only complaint is that it was *too* good, and we were finished without taking the time to savour it. Domimokah seemed pleased with our reception, and waited patiently until we were ready to walk with him. The breakfast, fit for a lord, did not dispel the memories of what we had experienced yesterday, though, and I made an effort to bear that in mind.\n\nAs we walked down a long, straight hallway, I gave Annie the liberty of asking the questions this time, though she definitely bordered on interrogation at some points. I chose to remain silent, in part because of the residual horror of yesterday’s events.\n\n“The monks here, the ones who sit still for as long as you have described; how are they alive, if their brains are gone?”\n\n“As I have said, they become receptacles, in which the great Well of Thought may reside, in some capacity. Their minds are not here, but there – as droplets of oil in an ocean, so that they are preserved as individuals.”\n\nAll the while, Annie was writing all this down on her notepad, as was I. Having two versions to compare is infinitely better than one, in my eyes at least. She continued with pre-planned questions, instead of delving further into the answers she received.\n\n“This Well you talk about so often, what are you referring to? The huge skull you showed us yesterday?”\n\n“The great Well of Thought, my friend. Would you lend your ear to me, allow me to enlighten you on why this place came to be?”\n\n“Of course,” Annie replied, instantly.\n\nDomimokah was silent for a time, seeming to ponder how to start the tale he was about to tell us. His head tilted back, eyes closed, before he returned to composure, and spoke,\n\n“Before us, there were nine beings who walked the Earth as one of its innate properties. Of these beings, they shared but one mind, a vast sea in which their ideas, thoughts and concepts came to fruition, and so would these manifest in the physical realm as they desired.\n\n“However, despite the limitless potential for creation, they felt a hollow, deep inside. What good were they as one perfect collective, with nothing else to witness them?\n\n“With much pondering, they conceived of free will; so they might create an independent being, but one with access to their great mind, in which they could think, ponder, and muse. As the source of the beings' creations, the mind was something they could not replicate, and so their only choice was to share a portion of their own.”\n\nAnnie seemed entranced by his telling, and had stopped writing. I kept on with it, though, as her backup.\n\n“But what good is a single living being with no companions, no way to pass on their ideas, and their memories? The beings considered this as well, and begot living creatures able to propagate through time. The mechanisms would vary, but most were successful. And with each new generation came a variation in their being; slight changes which morphed and shaped their forms over the ages. The wonder of evolution.\n\n“At first, in the expansive oceans, they spawned primordial, marine life. They observed, seldom interfering, watching as life began to vary, expand, change. For these beings, the wait for the first of the creatures to crawl onto the shore was but a fleeting moment, and soon, the creatures had evolved to be far more complex, acting off their own volition.\n\n“This went on, and here we are. Humanity. Mankind bred, had families, expanded, and built their settlements. Again, for living things to think for themselves, the beings had to share their Well of Thought. So, as the nine watched from out of view, seeing the good, the evil, and all in between emerge from the minds of humanity, it began to take a toll on them.\n\n“Their great mind became tainted, imprinted with the ideas, thoughts, and memories of all humankind, as they advanced further than could have been imagined. Aeons passed, and one by one, the nine beings began to perish in body. They travelled to remote and quiet places before their deaths. While only bones remain, they live on, inside the Well of Thought.”\n\nThough I transcribed his words, I doubted each and every one. How many men had proclaimed their dogmatic truths, all claiming to speak the words of a deity, taking themselves for prophets? Such is our single-mindedness.\n\n“For the beings, inventing life, free to act on its own, was their greatest mistake. For, while they hold unimaginable power even now, they are not all-powerful, and their sea of thoughts, while unfathomably vast, is not infinite, and each day it continues to be tainted, broken down, purely through the mere action of thinking.\n\n“So, the fate of humanity has come to be that one day, they will have run dry the great Well, and it will cease to exist, leaving all living things as beings of perception, nothing more. Egos will fade into nothingness, individuality forgotten. No more will be born new memories, nor thoughts, nor ideas, nor concepts; all that have existed throughout history will vanish, leaving humanity to roam aimlessly as mindless beings, acting purely out of instinct. We would hear, see, smell, and feel all, but comprehend or remember naught.”\n\nAdmittedly, I was impressed with the tale. Yet again, mankind would condemn itself to eternal torment, as is proclaimed in so many faiths. Perhaps there as an inherent loathing for those of our kind as we walk amongst them – we sure love weaving narratives about apocalypse and armageddon.\n\nSomething was missing though. What exactly had Domimokah, Yerhemmi, and the others devoted themselves for? What good was worship in the face of the inevitable? So, that I asked,\n\n“What’s the point of all this, then? Your faith, and how you insist on it? Why, if we’re all damned anyway?”\n\n“Well,” he replied, seeming to already know I would ask this, “it is a fate that is concrete no longer. Our founder encountered one of the nine in these hills, the skull of whom you have already witnessed, acting as a gateway of communication to the rest above, in the Well of Thought.\n\n“I understand our practice may seem rather... brutal, but rest assured that those who commune, are not in pain, or even discomfort - after the initial rite, at least, but that is a passing agony. Their minds are offered to the great Well, and they remain in communion for as long as needed. When the pure white flames spout from their empty skulls, that is when they are truly ready to enter unity, and so they are offered. There they remain alongside the nine, quietly assisting as angels of humanity.\n\n“When the time comes, we will wipe clean the slate; purge the sea of all thought, and start anew. The angels will guide humanity in rebuilding their societies, ideas, and connections, and I would hope that when the need arises once more in the distant future, our descendants will follow in our steps. I cannot say when this will happen, but the Well runs dry, and it may come sooner than we believed.\n\nEven holding my scepticism, I couldn’t help but shudder at the notion. To reduce every person to a mindless animal, then rebuild from the ground up. Every last memory of life, of friends and family, lost. Language, forgotten. If, hypothetically, this was all true, the plan Domimokah described did seem infinitely better than the alternative.\n\nI looked over to Annie, whose legs carried her along, but her mind was somewhere else. Despite the story being concluded, she still seemed ensnared in all she’d just heard.\n\n“Annie? Hey, Broadsword calling Annie-boy,” I said to her, lightly snapping my fingers. This worked in pulling her back to the physical realm, and she shook her head, and rubbed her eyes.\n\nI remembered only then about the spotlight-thing we’d encountered before reaching this place.\n\n“Hey, uh, about this Well thing. When we were coming up here, there was this huge beam of light coming out from these clouds. We were trying to fend off a mountain lion, and this big spotlight darted onto where it stood, and it burned. To a crisp.”\n\nDomimokah was hesitant to answer, but relented,\n\n“Yes, well… would you not hold some resentment for all those who caused your downfall, and bodily death? We are exempt, of course, but there is hostility against all beings that gestate thoughts within them. The judgemental eye you witnessed indeed dissolved the very consciousness of this animal, a thing bound so tightly to the body that removal leads to annihilation. That is why we are blessed, as the Well allows us to persist, despite this separation of flesh and self.”\n\nThat was all he was willing to share, apparently. He led us on silently, and before we realised, we were back at the skull room again. My memory isn’t photographic, but I could tell that the monks had not budged a single millimetre from before. The memories flooded back and I slowed my pace, cautiously.\n\n“I have a proposition,” Domimokah announced, “I am willing to permit you a fleeting glance into the eyes of the receptors here. I do not imagine you’ll be able to remain for long, but I must offer you this, as a courtesy. Do you accept?”\n\nI was wary, but to my surprise, Annie jumped at the opportunity. There was a glint of something in her eyes that I didn’t recognise. Something I couldn’t help but think was not herself. I stood, contemplating, as she was led over, and sat down between the others.\n\nDomimokah crouched and leaned in close, cupping her head and whispering something to her. At this, her back straightened, head upright. And she was still.\n\n“Well? Will you join your friend?”\n\nI didn’t like this, but I’d also come too far to pass off the chance to validate any of these wild claims. I was so stupid, to doubt it all despite what I’d already witnessed. But this contradiction irked me… so I accepted.\n\nDomimokah took my hand and led me over, beside Annie. I sat down, crossed my legs, and closed my eyes. I could feel him come down to my level, and he whispered to me what I’d previously not heard:\n\n“Become one, the mind is fluid. Yours is yours, but also all, and so all is yours. Set free the bounds of your thoughts. Peer into your true nature.”\n\nAs the last word was spoken, an electric feeling shot up my spine like nothing I’d felt before. I could feel it course through every single path of neurons, every portion of my brain ignited with a shock of newly found energy. More intense it grew, and I felt the edges of my mind dissolve, the way the rubber peels away after a water balloon is popped.\n\nSuddenly, it was as if I was rocketed upwards, far into the heavens above. All I saw was white at first, until the feeling of G’s pulling on myself ceased, and my vision cleared.\n\nIn front of me was a vast plane, rippling like the ocean surface. Unlike the previous whiteness, it was mottled, sullied with sickening hues of green, purple, brown… like endless patches of bruise and rot, eating away at the reality where I stood.\n\nWhere I stood… it would be inaccurate to say “where”, because all at once I saw it from an infinity of angles and positions, as if I were peering inwards, into my own consciousness.\n\nMemories from places unknown filtered through me, and I remembered lives I had not lived. Names that were not mine, parents and children I’d never known. It occurred to me that I wasn’t really sure on which of them were mine anymore, unable to distinguish between my own experiences and those of people who’d died long before my birth.\n\nEven so, all these memories were fleeting. Not one stayed for more than a moment before being replaced by another. I was Shakespeare writing Macbeth, a bullet traversed my brain as Abraham Lincoln, I hunted a mammoth with crudely made spears, I was…\n\nI felt a scream, but with no body I heard nothing. A tingling sensation overcame me in that moment, one of irretrievable loss that burned at the fringe of my psyche, stirring all that I was in a cognitive melting pot.\n\nAgain, the sudden acceleration hit me, and before I knew it my eyes were open and I finally heard my own screams. Something was flickering in front of me, so bright, it was… it was coming from me. My eyes, my mouth… god, it burned. It hurt. I couldn’t bear it.\n\nDomimokah was at my side, and through some esoteric practice the flames dissipated, leaving me unscathed. I sat in wide-eyed terror for a long time, before coming back to myself. Annie. I whipped around to my right, fearing the worst, but saw her with the most serene look on her face. How, how could she be peaceful in that place? I felt the question escape my lips without realising I had spoken.\n\n“Yes, she seems to be well attuned, doesn’t she? It’s rare to see such an affinity at first communion. Exceptional!” Domimokah exclaimed.\n\n“Yeah, it… it does seem that way.”\n\nShe didn’t return for a few minutes. Supposedly, I was only there for about ten seconds, but in that place… in that place, that span felt like countless lifetimes condensed into a single moment. I couldn’t fathom it, and I didn’t want to, to be honest.\n\nWe must have spoken for a long time as we walked before, as the sun had already started its descent. We were led back to our guest room, all the while Annie spouting revelations and realisations that meant nothing to me.\n\nIn my eyes, she was speaking complete nonsense, things so far-fetched that I had trouble understanding what she even meant. From what I could tell, it was like she’d been somewhere else entirely, in comparison to what I’d seen. The abrupt change disturbed me. She seemed almost a different person.\n\nBut god, I’m so tired now. My eyes are begging to close as I write this. Hopefully I can sleep uninterrupted tonight. We’ll leave tomorrow, I’m sure of it. I can’t imagine anything else Domimokah could possibly have to show us.\n\nI already know that I won’t be returning as the one who came here, but I refuse to lose any more. I’m worried for Annie, too. I don’t like how she was acting, her words sounded from someplace else.\n\nFirst thing tomorrow, we’re gone. If we make it out, expect an update later tomorrow.\n\n[Good night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rephlect/comments/11fdaok/theres_a_deceiver_in_the_hills_of_utah_4/)",

        "text": " \n\nThe day began like any other. I slid into the diner booth and nodded to Josie for the usual before heading to work. Four eggs, four slices of toast, four pieces of bacon really hit the spot. And coffee, of course…Can’t forget that.\n\nI wish I could forget what I heard.\n\nI wish I had sat at the bar. But no, I preferred booths.  At the bar, your back was to the door. Anyone could walk in on you and make your life hell. In a booth, you had a fighting chance. Plus, you could get cozy with company. Not that I ever sat with anyone, but maybe some small part of me hoped that one day I would.\n\nAs the seconds crawl by, that seems less and less likely. Let me back up.\n\nI was tearing into my breakfast. On a dreary day like this morning, with fuming gray clouds packed in overhead, it was all the more delicious. The damp street and cool breeze threatened more rain in the hours to come. Yeah. Breakfast was shaping up to be the best part of the day.\n\nA cold breeze cut in with the jingle of the door bell. I shivered and took a strong gulp of my coffee, barely registering the shapes settling into the booth behind me. I think maybe a part of me knew even then that something was wrong. Like a world weary ostrich, I buried my face into my breakfast.\n\n\"We got them,\" a rough voice said. “The [Creeps](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wtr00g/we_played_creep_in_an_abandoned_apartment_complex/) came through.”\n\n\"Oh good.\" This voice was lighter, like silk in my ears. \"I suppose we will have to thank Laura for that.” A pause. “What about the others?”\n\n“Well [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s77rbm/my_good_for_nothing_dad_passed_away_the/) is a complete bust. Who’d have thought he’d bungle the whole thing?”\n\n“We’ll have to start all over. Years of work, wasted.”\n\n“Fortunately,” Mr. Gruff went on, “the other [bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wc1z5w/my_grandmothers_doll_collection_part_1/) is an easy fix. Just have to nip a little bud.”\n\n“Easier said than done, I’m afraid,” Mr. Silk disagreed. “There was a succession.”\n\n“Fuck!”\n\n“Yes. And we can't afford to wait, either. The other groups are getting started soon. If we don’t finish our part....”\n\n“They might get around to using us.” Gruff finished the thought.\n\n“I don’t know about you, but I’d rather not become a blood sacrifice or mind puppet.”\n\n“Find someone to offer the deal.”\n\n“Alright, I’ll do that. What about the kid?”\n\n“I’ll take care of that....”\n\nI choked on my coffee. These guys were talking about some seriously fucked up shit. Were they going to kill a kid? I had to stop them. But what could I do? Threaten them here in the diner? Call the cops? I couldn’t prove anything.  I sat stiff in my seat, staring at the last of my breakfast. I agonized over it for a bit, but then I realized…\n\n\\--No. It was okay. I wasn’t helpless. I could just sit quietly in my seat, wait for them to leave, watch them through the windows. I could give their descriptions to the cops, and then--\n\n“hmmmm,” Silk pondered. “I think it’s time to go.”\n\nYes! I thought. I heard them get up, and the jingle of the bell as they left.\n\nI sipped slowly on my coffee, trying to slow down my heart. Just a moment more…\n\n“Hey, friend.”\n\nI froze.\n\nThe man from the booth. The sweet one.\n\n“How would you like a job?”\n\nI didn’t meet his eyes. “I.... I have a job.”\n\nI looked out the window. There was the other man, staring through the glass at me. He looked like someone had carved down a mountain and covered it in hair.\n\nThe sweet man slid into the seat across from me. Thin, far too well dressed, far too smug.\n\n“Don’t mind him. Focus on me.”\n\nI looked back and forth between them.\n\n“Focus. On. Me.” \n\nThe way he said it clogged my veins. I choked and shuddered and yet somehow felt more alive than I ever had been. Try as I might, I could not help but look at him. Gentle fingers guiding my face? Sugar packing my arteries? Manacles tightening down on me?\n\n“I need you to do something for me. Just a small thing.”\n\n\"No.\"\n\n“It’s my deal.” He nodded out the window. “Or his.”\n\nThe guy out the window just stared.\n\n“N-no.” I said. Hopefully I looked braver than I felt.\n\n“Okay!” He clasped his hands together. Nothing we can do about that, eh?” He stood up.\n\nHe left, and as he met the man outside they had a brief exchange and then wandered off in different directions. I stared out the window for I don’t know how long, trying to make sure they were gone. The last of my food went cold.\n\n“Coffee?”\n\n“Gah!” I jumped. \n\nThe waitress leaned back a bit.” You okay?”\n\n“Y-yeah. More coffee please.” I pushed my cup over.\n\nThe clouds had broken up outside and the sun began to shine down. The day got brighter and brighter, and this might ordinarily put a smile on my face as I headed to work, but not today. I kept checking around, but did not find either of the men as I walked to my car. Nor did I spot them as I drove to work. I went in, did my shift, thoughts of them plaguing me all the while.\n\nJust another boring, ordinary day.\n\nI tried to talk myself out of my funk. It was just a one off. Maybe I had imagined the whole thing. Overactive imagination of a loser in a dead end job. Nothing better to do than make up fantasies about being some hero and saving a kid.\n\nOr, maybe they were just two assholes playing a prank. Go into a diner, see who they can spook with fucked up conversations. Very funny. Surely they wouldn’t be stupid enough to talk about committing crimes in public. They’d have to know someone would hear. No way they were serious.\n\nI told myself those things as I clocked out, as I drove home, as I walked into my apartment and shrugged off the day.\n\nBut now….\n\nMr. Gruff is outside my window. Standing under a streetlamp Looking up directly at me.\n\nI live on the third floor. The light is almost blinding. I can’t see his eyes… I can’t see his face at all in the heavy shadows cast by the light… but I’d recognize that silhouette anywhere. I can feel him staring at me.\n\nThere’s a knock on my door.\n\n“Hello in there!” that silky voice again. Sing-songy. “Laaaaaast Chance!”\n\nI… I can feel myself twitching and jerking. My body wants to open the door. To let them in. I can’t help myself.\n\nMy… my feet are moving on their own… It’s all I can do to even type this out. Each lurching step drawing me to certain doom. I don’t know what they want from me… but it can’t be good….\n\nPlease, anyone, if you read this---\n\nHaha. just kidding. honestly, Everything’s okay. Look People, if you’re in need of a cool gig, I know soMe pEople. and they are….always… hiring….",

        "text": "Hey y'all, the name's kinkyboy(atleast on this side of my life) and i really need help from some of you guys.... \n\nI was walking through my town in Japan at about 9 o clock in the morning, and i was high as hell. The previous night, I hadn't slept a wink because my parents weren't home.... But my girlfriend was. We ended up smoking a whole pack together and were extremely unpresentable. I remember everything being wonky as hell and feeling like I was in some mirror dimension. But today morning, I had to walk my girlfriend home, which is exactly what I did. After that i decided to take a stroll around town, go visit all the parts I'd been to sober to visit previously. \n\n\nOur town had 2 sides, one side was relatively normal with nothing out of place, a normal town with a school, hospital, and anything else a normal town would have. Well, that was the North side. The South side was a whole other story, it was under the control of Yaa-sans(Yakuzas) and was basically a harbour for every and any kind of illegal activity you could think of(in fact, this was the area I went to yesterday to buy cigarettes and condoms). As I was walking I suddenly realised I'd have to buy some sort of scent to help rid my house from the stink of nicotine. As though the world read my mind, right there on my left  was a yard sale. Now firstly, this is probably the first time I'd ever seen a yard sale in Japan, secondly, I was high as fuck, so going anywhere was probably a bad idea.... \n\n\nBut well, as a teenager all I do is make bad decisions. I walked towards the yard and as I stepped onto the premises of the sale I started getting a little dizzier. I felt as though I was walking on water, or some other jelly-like wet substance. And before I knew what had happened I was walking home with something in a bag(the candles), and my head still dizzy. Now this is the part where things became weird. As I entered my house and took the candles out of the bag I noticed that they were colored pure black. Now I don't know about the rest of y'all but I ain't never seen no pure black candles before, I mean, even the wick was black. For some reason, I started laughing. For some reason, I was losing my shit just looking at this candle. For some reason, I just kept laughing at the candle in my hand. \n\n\nThat was all I remembered before I woke up right now. I looked at the time(12pm) and realises id slept for about 3 hours, and my room still smelled of nicotine. With a slight headache now, I reached for the candles at my side and lit them up. One in every corner of my room. Conveniently enough, I only had four candles in my bag, so I had used all the candles.  I then decided to leave my room while it clears up of nicotine smell and go to my balcony where I once again, proceeded to smoke a cigarette, the last one I had in my stash at that.  I proceeded to check my phone and saw a text from my parents saying they'd be a little late, I sighed in relief as this meant I'd have more time to clear up the house while they were gone. After finishing my cigg, I decided to go back into my room and what I saw there was absolutely horrifying. \n\n\nIn the middle of my room, a smoke bubble had formed, and in the smoke bubble were images of some sort. I slammed the door shut as I walked out of the room and realised I must still be high. That's when out of the corner of my eye I noticed a thin sheet of paper attached to the bag in which I had kept the candles. This is what it read-\n\n. \n\n. \n\nRules to summon [REDACTED] \n\n\n1) Place the candles given to you in the four corners of the room where you wish to summon [REDACTED]\n\n\n2) Leave the room and shut the door while [REDACTED] takes it's form. \n\n\n3) After exactly 27 minutes, [REDACTED] will appear through a cloud of smoke which should be formed in the middle of the room vide said candles. \n\n\n4) You now have another 13 minutes to wait while [REDACTED] climbs it's way out of the smoke cloud. \n\n\n5) Once [REDACTED] has formed, be sure to spray salt on the area surrounding it and chant the following-\n\n. ;'\";'-+_!? *.;'=°^•`×=°×`°\"*+.,., _-\".*':--&amp;_+©®°$=€π√|℅€\\®¶]°∆¶`℅¥^~×९Ϭ५Ӡ+%𝟠⊘Ƽ𝟙Ӡ/ {¢™~÷©™®{¥×π^! '\n\n\n6) After completion of the above instructions, you shall have very successfully summoned [REDACTED]\n\n\n7) Congratulations on full control of your very own underworld assasin! Do be aware though, you must order the death of one person every 12 hours, else the assasin will come for you instead. \n\n\n\n\nAnd that's where it ends, suddenly I heard some noise coming from my room, quickly, I rushed to get table salt. This was a time for acting, not thinking. I've read enough of those stories to know what happens if I don't follow the rules. To all those who mysteriously die in the next 70 odd years or till whenever I can get rid of this thing, I apologise. And as for the help I need, I'm gonna need the names of anyone and everyone you'd like me to kill. Preferably at least 730 names so that it lasts me a year.... I really don't want to die. \n\n:)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11fazem/my_girlfriend_got_me_hooked_on_a_drug_named/",
        "text": "I  met her during my first time at a club. It was quite the strange  experience. I’d never been out dancing before, had never even gotten  drunk and didn’t know the first thing about drugs.\n\nYou see, I grew up in an extremely religious household; church every Sunday, praying before every meal, all of it.\n\nI  didn’t mind these things so much. What I did mind was her constant talk  about sins, temptation, the devil and going to hell. I heard it pretty  much every day, and at least once a week, she’d promised me I’d be going  to hell for... something. I absolutely hated it and it was what drove  me to become interested in paganism, and in witches.\n\nIt was only natural that when I finally moved on to college, I’d major in religious studies with a focus on paganism.\n\nCollege  was a revelation for me. For the first time, I got away from home, away  from mom’s obsession with Christ, and I could figure out who I really  was and wanted to be. But also, to try out a few things I’d never dared  before.\n\nI  loved the college lifestyle. My fellow students were all so different  from the people I grew up around. Alcohol, drugs, and alternative  lifestyles were big amongst them. Yet as much as I pride myself about  trying new things and going wild, I didn’t. While I hated mom’s talk  about sin, I was, deep inside, a mousy little thing, shy and reclusive,  reluctant to try anything new.\n\nIt  was my friend Emily who eventually convinced me to tag along when she  went to one of her favorite clubs. It was a back alley scene club; the  type frequented by the weirder and more alternative parts of the  population.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say I felt like I didn’t belong there.\n\nAfter  we’d entered, Emily was quick to order us each a beer and, before she  promptly vanished to ‘mingle,’ as she called it, and I was left to my  own devices.\n\nFor the next hour, I  just stood at the edge of the dance floor, half-heartedly drinking my  beer and watching people. The air was heavy with the smell of sweat and  alcohol and the loud booming music reverberated painfully inside my  head.\n\nAfter a while, I noticed a  guy eying me. He gave me a drunken smile before he awkwardly danced in  front of me. I sighed. He’d probably noticed my bored, dejected look,  and was hoping for an ‘easy’ win.\n\nI rolled my eyes and tried my best to ignore his advances, hoping he’d give up soon enough.\n\nWhen  that didn’t work, I fled to a different floor. For some reason,  however, he kept following me. Regardless of where I went, he soon found  me and lingered nearby.\n\nIt was Melinda who saved me.\n\nI’d  just settled down on a couch in one of the club’s quieter areas, the  smoking area, as I should soon find out. After only a minute, the same  creepy guys stumbled in as well.\n\nBefore he could approach me, however, a woman set down next to me.\n\nShe  was absolutely gorgeous. For a second, all my memories of and the  feelings I’d had for a girl during high school,  resurfaced, and my  heart skipped a beat. Yet I could tell right away that this woman was so  much more than she could’ve ever been.\n\nHer  outfit was simplistic, almost too much so, nothing but a tank top and  shorts, but it fit her perfectly. She had cropped blond hair with a few  darker strands mixed into it. Her most stunning feature, however, were  her eyes. They were bright green, and seemed to focus on me and me  alone, almost as if she was staring into me.\n\n“You new here? Haven’t seen you around?” she half-whispered at me, giving me a coy little smile.\n\nInstead  of answering, I just stared at her. When I realized what I was doing, I  quickly looked away, took a big sip of beer, and then focused on the  creepy guy again. He was sitting on a couch nearby, pretending to mind  his own business, but I noticed his short, side-way glances.\n\nThe woman next to me turned in his direction as well.\n\n“Just ignore him. He’ll give up soon enough.”\n\nJust as she said this, the guy suddenly got off and walked away.\n\n“See? It’s just that easy. I’m Melinda, by the way.”\n\n“Oh, my name is, I mean, I’m Claire. Nice to meet you,” I brought out, stumbling over my words.\n\nMelinda  giggled. Then she reached into her purse, brought out a pack of  cigarettes, lit one and leaned back. After two pulls, she held the  cigarette out for me.\n\nI wasn’t a smoker, had never even touched a cigarette, but still took it, almost unconsciously. I started coughing right away.\n\nLaughing, Melinda took it back.\n\nFor  the next minute, I just sat there, next to her, entranced by her, and  watched as she exhaled cloud after cloud of bluish-grey smoke.\n\nOnce she’d finished her cigarette, she got up, but handed me another one.\n\n“Just so you don’t forget me. See you later, little Claire.”\n\nWith that, she went on her way back to wherever she’d come from.\n\nI was left sitting there, cigarette in hand, staring after her.\n\nFor long minutes, I tried to make sense of the encounter and the many conflicting feelings inside of me.\n\nEventually, a clearly drunk Emily found me again.\n\n“I didn’t know you smoked, Claire,” she said.\n\n“I don’t. Oh, this? Yeah, no it’s... never mind,” I said, shaking my head before I carefully put the cigarette into my purse.\n\nWe  were at the club for another hour. While Emily was dancing and having  fun, my eyes wandered around, looking for Melinda. Yet she seemed to  have vanished.\n\nFor the next few  days, I couldn’t get her out of my head. I don’t know what it was, but  there was something special about Melinda. The way she carried herself,  her confidence, but also other, smaller things I’d noticed about her.  Around her wrist, she’d worn a small, pearly armband, and I’d also  noticed the purple healing stone fastened to her necklace. It made me  wonder if she might be interested in the same things I was.\n\nI was back at the club a week later. This time, on my own.\n\nFor long minutes, I walked from floor to floor, desperately trying to find her, but there was no hint of her.\n\nFrustrated,  I went back to the smoking area and found myself an empty seat. There I  sat, brooding, and eventually pulled out the cigarette Melinda had  handed me a week ago. As my thoughts drifted away, I absentmindedly  rolled it between my fingers, playing with it.\n\n“Need a light?”\n\nIn  surprise, I dropped the cigarette. When I turned around, I saw Melinda.  Somehow, without even noticing, she’d found me and sat down right next  to me.\n\n“So, you’re smoking now?”\n\n“No. Well, I guess?” I said, giving her a little shrug.\n\nThen  I picked up the cigarette and held it out for her to light. Of course, I  coughed again, but somehow, with each pull, and with Melinda next to  me, it seemed to get easier.\n\nThat night, we started talking, and that night I got to know her.\n\nAs  I’d thought, Melinda shared many of my interests. Yet the way she went  about them was much more intense. She was much more intense.\n\nWhile  I read books on pagan rituals, collected healing stones, and made my  own witchy jewelry and accessories, she’d gone much deeper.\n\nShe  talked about rituals, too, but the ones she herself had performed.  She’d go on about real magic, real witches, different planes and places,  places, she said, where magic originated from.\n\nTalking  to her was nothing short of enthralling, almost intoxicating.  Eventually, as night turned to early morning, we exchanged phone  numbers, and, a moment later, Melinda was gone again.\n\nWe  ended up texting all throughout the week. Melinda told me more about  the things she’d done, recommended me books, but also shared a few niche  blogs on astral projection I might be interested in.\n\nYet  there was one thing she was steadfast about. If I truly wanted to  learn, to become enlightened, as she put it, I’d have to do the real  thing.\n\nWhen I asked her if she was  talking about some sort of ritual, all I got was a little emoticon.  Then, a few seconds later, she added a simple ‘You’ll find out on  Saturday. Same place, same time?’\n\nThat’s  just how she was, always a tad bit mysterious, but I’d have to lie if I  didn’t like it. Before I knew it, I’d already sent her a yes.\n\nWhen  Saturday evening arrived, I headed for the club right away. This time, I  didn’t waste any time looking for her, but headed straight for the  smoking area.\n\nMelinda was already  there, waiting for me. She sat on a couch in the back, staring at me  with her bright, green eyes and bidding me to join her.\n\n“So, the real deal? What is it? You want us to do some sort of weird dance ritual?” I asked, laughing a little.\n\n“Oh no, little Claire, it’s something much, much better.”\n\nWith  that, her hand vanished inside her purse, and then, careful to hide it  from the other people in the smoking area, produced a small Ziploc bag  containing a strangely growing powder.\n\nFor a moment, I just stared at it, not understanding. When my brain functioned again, I realized what she was holding.\n\n“Wait. No way, Melinda, that stuff... I can’t.”\n\n“There’s a first for everything,” Melinda said in a sing-song voice, giving me another one of her seductive smiles.\n\nFor the first time, her smile didn’t work on me.\n\n“No, really. This,” I said, holding up the cigarette I was smoking, “sure, but not that.”\n\nI  grew angry, furious even. Was this the reason she’d talked to me? Was  all this a ploy to get me hooked on some sort of weird designer drug?\n\nIn my anger, I was about to get up, but felt Melinda’s hand close around my wrist.\n\n“Oh, but don’t you want to learn more? This stuff here, this Oneiria, is the way to go, the way to learn, little Claire.”\n\nI  was still angry with her, but then I thought about mom, about my life  until now. Wasn’t Melinda right? Wasn’t I here to experience new things,  to learn and to get enlightened? The smallest of smiles came over my  face. Yes, I was, and I was here to sin, to do all the things my mom had  warned me about, and told me I’d go to hell for.\n\nWhen Melinda saw that small smile, she pulled me in close and kissed me.\n\nThe  moment our lips made contact, all the apprehension and all my doubts  evaporated. I was obsessed with this woman. When our lips parted, I gave  her a nod and said I was ready to try, if only this once.\n\nThe moment I took Oneiria, as she’d called it, the world changed.\n\nAll  the colors around me intensified, as if the world’s saturation had been  turned up a few notches. The same was true for my feelings. For the  first time, I could truly feel the world around me, could feel every  part of my body, and, of course, I could feel Melinda.\n\nAlmost in a trance, I let her take my hand and lead me to the dance floor.\n\nMy  eyes wandered around; the world seemed so, so different. Everything  around me was moving faster, then slower again. Motions and people  became blurs, washing into each other.\n\nThen  I focused on Melinda again. She was in front of me, her arms around me.  I could feel the warmth of her emotions radiate from her and wash over  me in heavy waves. It felt like I was a part of her and her a part of  me.\n\nAt one point, we made out right there, on the dance floor. It was the most intense thing I’d ever felt in my entire life.\n\nThe  longer I danced with Melinda, our hands grasping each other, our lips  touching, the more the world changed. I saw things I’d never seen  before. People were glowing brightly, their energy wafting through the  air, intermingling and mixing into a kaleidoscope of living colors.\n\nAnd then, for whatever reason, my eyes wandered upwards.\n\nThe club’s ceiling was gone. Twirling stars, and mad, sparkling galaxies unlike anything I’d ever seen before replaced it.\n\nIt was nothing short of magical, and as I moved my hand through the air, the stars above responded to my every motion.\n\nThen  my trance-like fascination was interrupted by a moment of clarity. I  instantly cringed back from the surreal sight above me, averted my eyes,  and tried to feel from the dance floor.\n\nYet  I was held in place. When I stared at Melinda, she, too, had changed.  By now, she was nothing but bright light and pure, intense feeling. I  felt her holding me in place, surrounding me, engulfing me.\n\n“This is what you were looking for all along, little Claire, this is it,” her sing-song voice reverberated inside my mind.\n\nA second later, I drifted off.\n\nWhen I awoke, I was in bed. For a moment, I shivered when I remembered what had happened.\n\nSuddenly, I realized I was naked, grew confused when I realized I wasn’t in my dorm room.\n\nThen Melinda entered the room, similarly naked.\n\n“Melinda?” I brought out. “What happened? What did we...?”\n\nHer answer was nothing but a smile, but one that told me more than enough.\n\nOnce I’d calmed down, I spoke again.\n\n“What was that last night?”\n\n“Oneiria,”  Melinda answered, matter-of-factly. “It allows you to see. Not only  what’s out there, but also what you desire, the magic you always dreamed  of.”\n\nAfter that night, it didn’t  take long for me to get hooked. I’d told myself repeatedly to not give  into it, that I’d just do it once more. Yet Oneiria had this strange  fascination to it.\n\nIt differed  from any other drug I’d heard about. You weren’t just getting high, it  allowed you to visit certain different places. Every time the two of us  indulged in Oneiria, I saw the same mad, sparkling galaxies, but also a  world in which magic was real.\n\nEventually,  I learned I wasn’t the only person Melinda had introduced Oneiria to.  When I first heard this, I felt betrayed, and a pang of jealousy shot  through my entire body. I almost left, never to talk to her again. Yet  Melinda assured me I was special. I was the one, the only one she loved.  All those others, they were friends, acquaintances, people of mutual  interest. I was different.\n\nWhat  can I say? I believed her. And so, a few days later, I joined her during  her next meeting with her little witches’ circle, who all indulged in  Oneiria.\n\nEvery time I did it,  however, the drug’s effect became stronger. It was barely noticeable,  but noticeable nonetheless. The visions I saw intensified, and each  time, I caught more glimpses of this other world. It was a place where  not only magic was real, but witches, paganism, and magical creatures as  well.\n\nIt was a place, I  eventually learned, where even I had power, actual power, and could  command the magic I so longed for. No longer was I mousy little Claire,  but what I’d always wanted to be: a witch, an actual witch.\n\nYet  as much as I loved the place, and as much as I loved Melinda, something  about it felt wrong. That place, it felt too different and too far  away, too detached.\n\nAt the same  time, however, whenever I was there, I felt this pull, a pull from  somewhere beyond that pulled me in just a tad bit closer.\n\nEventually,  I realized, deep inside, I didn’t really want this. I didn’t want to  get any closer. What I wanted was to feel magic, to command it, sure,  but not in some otherworldly, drug-infused dreamscape. I’d wanted to do  it here, to bring just a bit of magic into my boring secluded life. If I  couldn’t even do that, then all of this was meaningless, might as well  not have been real.\n\nNo, as much as  I was pulled in, as much as I wanted more of it, I didn’t want to leave  the real world behind, at least not just yet.\n\nAbout a week ago, things took a turn for the worse.\n\nOnce  again, our little circle met up, and once again, we readied ourselves  for another round of Oneiria-infused scrying. That night, however, we,  or rather they, went further than ever before.\n\nWhile  they all indulged in Oneiria, I sat there, holding the tiny Ziploc bag  in hand, merely staring at it. I could feel the pull, watched as my  fingers unconsciously opened the bag, my brain getting ready to indulge  again. Then, I struggled against it. At first it was nothing but a  half-hearted attempt, an afterthought, but soon it rose in power. As I  did, I felt Melinda’s eyes on me, and somehow, this was enough to break  free. The Ziploc bag dropped from my hand and I leaned back, thinking  I’d finally broken free.\n\nYet  as I sank back into my seat, I saw the ceiling above me opening up,  vanishing, before the mad, sparkling galaxies replaced it. Then, we were  all pulled in closer, towards the world of magic we’d visited so many  times before.\n\nBut  I hadn’t taken the drug. So how was this possible? How was I able to  see what I’d thought of as nothing but Oneiria-infused hallucinations,  tricks of the mind? Did it mean that all of it, all the visions, all the  things I’d seen were… real?\n\nAnxious,  in confused terror, I turned toward Melinda, only to see she’d changed.  What had once been a woman with cropped blond hair and bright green  eyes was now a glimmering witch made of nothing but stars, a twisted  space nebula.\n\nShe seemed to  extend, to spread out, growing bigger, wider, an all-encompassing shroud  of stars, fire and magic that washed over us.\n\nBut  then, once she’d filled out the entire room, she opened up, and for the  first time, I could see it clearly: the twisted, magical wonderland.\n\nIt  was right there, right in front of me, so close, I could almost touch  it. I saw energy wafting through the air like colorful clouds, saw  magical creatures and fantastical beings.\n\nYet  the place was all wrong. Its physics made no sense. It was upside down,  but was not; it was circular but spread out and even. I saw mountains  growing from the skies, mad galaxies that seemed far away but right  there. Behind it all, I saw beings as massive as stars, unfathomable  things reaching out, ever reaching out, further and further.\n\nInstantly,  I drew back, averted my eyes, and started screaming in sheer and utter  terror. These screams were drowned out by those of the other members of  the group. Theirs, however, were screams of joy. Soon, a cacophony of  barely human jubilation echoed through the room, through the entire  building, as they all threw themselves into the dreamscape ahead.\n\nFor a moment, I could see them running into one another, becoming one being before they were torn apart again.\n\nStill  screaming, I scrambled away and retreated to the farthest corner of the  room. There I sat, shivering and shaking, my eyes closed and my hands  pressed over my ears.\n\nI stayed like this for what felt like an eternity.\n\nFinally, I felt a hand touching my face. I jerked up, cringed away, but saw it was Melinda.\n\n“It’s okay now, little Claire. It’s over.”\n\n“W-what the hell was that?”\n\n“I guess it wasn’t for you. Maybe not yet, maybe never.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I showed it to you, little Claire, a place where you can be yourself, where you’ll find what you’ve been looking for.\n\n“But that place... I don’t want it. Not like that.”\n\nWhen I said this, Melinda’s eyes turned sad and a moment later, she got up.\n\n“That’s it then,” she eventually said, her voice as sad as her eyes.\n\n“Wait, what do you mean?”\n\n“I was only here to help, little Claire, to show, not to force.”\n\n“No, but I love you. I love us, and I want to-“\n\n“Do you really? Or were you just looking for someone to enlighten you, to show you just how much more there’s out there?”\n\n“No! I mean... I don’t know. I don’t freaking know, all right?!”\n\nAt  that moment, Melinda came closer. Once more, she put her lips on mine. I  savored that kiss more than any other we’d shared before.\n\nWhen  our lips parted, I could see the same mad, sparkling galaxies in her  eyes and could feel her body surrounding me. It felt as if she was more  magic than a real person.\n\nMy eyes grew wide, and I went forward to touch, to indulge in her, but Melinda stopped me.\n\n“See? You didn’t want me, didn’t want Melinda, but those feelings, the magic of that other place.”\n\n“But... it’s gone now, isn’t it?”\n\n“You can find it again, the Oneiria, the magic, all of it.”\n\n“What about you?”\n\n“Me? What do you think I am?”\n\n“You are...”\n\nAs much as I tried, I couldn’t answer her question.\n\n“Nothing but a dream,” Melinda whispered into my ear.\n\nA moment later, she was gone, leaving me alone in the empty room.\n\nIt’s  been days since then. Even now, I can’t make sense of what happened.  Neither can I make sense of who, or what, Melinda truly was.\n\nYet  at night, I often dream of that place, a place where magic is real.  It’s a place where I am truly a witch. Sometimes, out of the corner of  my eye, I catch a glimpse of her, of a woman with cropped blond hair,  and bright green eyes who’s boding me forward to join her.\n\nWhenever  I awake from those dreams, I’m filled with the utmost fear, but a fear  that’s different from that of any other nightmares.\n\nFor as much as I oppose it, as much as I don’t want to go, I long for it with every fiber of my being.\n\nI  know that eventually, I will go back to those back alley scene clubs,  those frequented by the weirder, more alternative parts of the  population.\n\nAnd one day, regardless if I want to or not, I know I will indulge in it again, [indulge in Oneiria.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": "September 24th, 2019-8:36pm\nToday marks the first day of our camping trip. My friends and I have been planning this for months, and we were finally able to find a suitable spot deep in the woods. We arrived at our campsite just as the sun was beginning to set. We set up our tents and gathered around the campfire. The night was filled with laughter and good times. But little did we know that our happy camping trip would soon turn into a nightmare.\n\nSeptember 25th, 2019- 3:27pm\nThe second day of our camping trip was when things started to get strange. It began with strange noises outside of our tents, and every time we looked, there was nothing there. We all tried to brush it off as just our imagination, but deep down, we all knew something was off.\n\n10:47pm\nLater that night, as we sat around the campfire, we heard a blood-curdling scream coming from the woods. We immediately grabbed our flashlights and went to investigate. As we made our way deeper into the woods, the screams grew louder, and the feeling of unease grew stronger. Suddenly, we heard a rustling in the bushes, and we all froze. That's when we saw it. Standing in front of us was a creature unlike anything we had ever seen before. It was tall and thin with matted fur covering its body. Its eyes glowed a menacing yellow, and its teeth were razor-sharp. We all stood in shock and fear, unsure of what to do. That's when it started to change.\n\nThe creature started to contort and shift, its fur falling off its body as it transformed into a human-like figure. It was a skinwalker. We had heard stories of these creatures before, but we never believed they were real. Now we knew the truth, and it was terrifying. The skinwalker didn't speak, but it didn't need to. Its presence alone was enough to send chills down our spines. We tried to run, but it was too fast, and soon it caught up to us. We tried to fight, but our weapons were useless against it. The skinwalker was too powerful.\n\n3:34am\nAs the night wore on, the skinwalker began to toy with us. It would appear out of nowhere, causing us to jump in fear. It would mimic our voices, making it impossible to tell who was who. We were all on edge, and it was getting harder and harder to keep our sanity.\n\nOctober 1st,2019- 11:17pm\nDays turned into nights, and the skinwalker never left us alone. It would always be there, lurking in the shadows, waiting for its next victim. We tried to leave the woods, but it was like we were trapped. The skinwalker seemed to have a hold on us, and there was no escaping its grasp. We had been out in the woods for a week when the skinwalker finally made its move. It attacked us in our sleep, dragging us out of our tents and into the woods. My friends screamed as they were taken, one by one. I tried to fight, but it was no use. The skinwalker was too strong. I was the last one left, and I knew it was only a matter of time before the skinwalker would come for me. I sat there, huddled in the darkness, waiting for the end to come. I knew I was going to die.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a voice calling out to me. It was one of my friends, the one who had been taken just hours before. He was covered in scratches and bruises, but he was alive. He had managed to escape from the skinwalker's grasp, and he had come back to save me. We ran through the woods, dodging trees and jumping over rocks. I could hear the skinwalker's footsteps behind us, and I knew it was gaining on us. But my friend never looked back, and I trusted him.\n\nFinally, we burst out of the woods and into an open field. We collapsed onto the ground, gasping for air. That's when I saw it. My friend's eyes were glowing the same menacing yellow as the skinwalker's. He smiled at me, revealing the razor-sharp bloody teeth that had been terrorizing me for what felt like an eternity. his breath was foul, as if i was sniffing into a diaper-filled dumpster. I ran as far away as i could, and he didn’t even move. He just watched me run, as if it was some sick game to him. I am writing this as fast as i can but, im starting to pick up that, eerily, disgusting smell again. To anyone who is reading this, IF anyone is even reading this, Don’t come for me.",

        "text": "The wall between my sister Maia’s room and mine is paper thin. If it wasn’t, I would never have found out. I’d be safer and happier, and I wouldn’t be huddled over my computer screen in the dark, terrified of what’s happening on the other side of the wall. \n\nThings didn’t always used to be this way. We used to live in a big old house with a pear tree out front and plenty of space for everyone, instead of the basement apartment the four of us are crammed into now. \n\nBut that was before Maia got sick. \n\nBack then, I thought that nothing bad could happen to Maia. She was just too *perfect.* My sister was one of those fit, tanned, hyper-friendly girls who seemed able to participate in every sport and social event without ever running out of energy. She always seemed to know the right thing to wear or say, and she bore the burden of our immigrant parents’ ridiculously-high expectations with a smile. \n\nI, on the other hand, was the opposite of all those things–\n\nBut as long as Maia was around, it didn’t matter. \n\nNo matter how discouraged or unloved I felt, I was always sure that *somehow* my older sister would take care of it. \n\nWhen Maia first got sick, we all thought she'd be better in a week. But the week became a month, and the months stretched on into years. My parents dug our family into a pit of debt trying to save their golden child. \n\n*“You’ll see,”* my mother would soothe my father while he stared, incredulous, at the pile of bills on the kitchen table. *“It’ll all be worth it when we get our Maia back.”* That was six years ago, and since then, my sister has only gotten worse. \n\nIt started as just a little tiredness, a little lightheadedness, the way Maia’s smile faded faster than it had before. As always, my sister tried to be the strong one, but the truth was that Maia was becoming weaker every day. \n\nThere wasn’t any one cause that the doctors could diagnose or treat; my sister was just…*less,* like her body had an imperceptible leak from which her spirit was slowly draining. \n\nNow, my sister is twenty-three, and she can no longer eat or use the restroom without help. Of course, she can’t walk or speak either–\n\nOr so I thought, until late last night. \n\nI awoke to the creaking of the floor in my sister’s room. At first I thought my father or mother was helping her out of bed, but then I heard something I hadn’t heard in seven years. Something that chilled my blood. I heard my sister’s voice through the wall.\n\n*“If I could do anything, what would it be…”* Maia used to have a loud, almost aggressive way of talking, but now her words came out in a dry rasp that sounded horribly close to my ear. \n\n“...Maia?” I whispered back–\n\nBut I don’t think she heard me. She just kept on talking:\n\n*“If I could do anything, I think I’d walk down the street and toss my hair. I’d smile at a guy and watch his face light up…that’s what I’d do first. Then I’d go shopping and buy a whole new wardrobe for all the parties my friends would host to welcome me back…”* \n\nSometimes Maia would pause, as though someone else were in the room with her and they were sharing a conversation…*but that was impossible*. The whole family was already in bed!\n\n*Maybe my sister is just lonely,* I thought, as the strange one-sided conversation went on. \n\nI started spending more time with Maia than I usually did, hoping that talking to her a little more would help. I spent an hour or two in my sister’s room every day, doing homework or reading, but I hardly ever said more than a few words to her.\n\nMaia had stopped speaking to us years ago…yet here she was, talking to herself in the middle of the night. It was unnerving to say the least. \n\nThe next day, I made a point to talk to Maia more than just the usual *“how are you, sis?”* and *“love you lots.”* I described my day, told her a stupid joke I’d heard at university, and asked her opinion about what outfit I should buy.\n\nThe truth was, I had no intention of going shopping anytime soon. I just thought it might lift her spirits, but Maia stayed silent as always.\n\nThat silence was one of the things that makes it so hard to stay in Maia’s room for any length of time. There’s no television, no radio, not even the ticking of a clock. We’d offered my sister all of those things, but she had just waved them away with a feeble gesture of her hand. \n\nThere isn’t much light, either. Maia keeps the blinds closed, and the only other illumination she’ll tolerate comes from a tiny bedside lamp. Between the dim light and the fact that nothing in the room has changed in the past six years, sitting by my sister’s beside feels like being inside some kind of creepy time capsule.\n\nMy sister’s lacrosse uniform, prom dress, and massive collection of jeans all still hang in the closet, as though they’re waiting for her to get out of bed and slip them on again.\n\nPosters of her favorite bands and actors (circa 2016) stare unblinkingly down at where Maia lays, eyes shut, barely breathing. The books she used to read to me are still stacked in her bookshelves, but now, *I* read them to *her.* \n\nThe eeriest thing about Maia’s room, though, is the fancy oval mirror hanging on the wall across from her bed. She used to say that putting her makeup on with it made her feel like a movie star, but I don’t see how. Maybe it’s just the gloomy light, but there’s something off about how reflections look in that old mirror. \n\nPale as she is, Maia practically glows in the dusky looking-glass; I look like a gray, insignificant shadow beside her, and the rest of the room fades away into darkness. Sometimes, though, I’d swear that I see something moving in there, out of the corner of my eye….\n\nThat’s usually when I leave Maia’s room. I tell myself I’m tired, that the bad illumination is straining my eyes, or that my sister needs to rest…\n\nBut the truth is that I’m afraid of what might happen next. \n\nMy parents and I have tried to change the layout of Maia’s room and take down that awful mirror, but my sister won’t have it–\n\nAnd when she reaches out weakly, begging us wordlessly to leave things how they are–\n\nHow could we possibly reject her wishes? \n\n*“My friends were always jealous of me,”* Maia rasped through my wall on the second night, jolting me awake. *“It used to bother me, but now I miss it. I mean, look at me now–who would ever want to be me? I wish I could go out again...I wish my old friends would see me dancing and too stunned to speak…”* My muscles tensed up with fear as Maia whispered to the darkness about her friends, going on about petty feuds and jealousies that had surely been long forgotten by everyone else involved. \n\nI couldn’t tell which was more frightening: the possibility that my sister was hiding her ability to speak for some reason, or the thought that *someone else* who sounded like her was talking on the other side of the wall at night. *If I went into my sister’s room now,* I wondered in horror, *what would I see?*\n\nAs much as they disturbed me, my sister’s midnight rants also gave me an idea about how I might be able to help her. *What if I looked up one of her old crew and asked them to visit her?* \n\nI decided to start making calls the very next day…but only one of Maia’s friends picked up–\n\nAnd the past six years hadn’t been kind to Leslie Macomb. \n\nFrom stalking her on social media, I knew that she’d gotten pregnant by her high school boyfriend, had him locked up after a domestic dispute, and started a GoFundMe to pay for her terrier’s life-saving surgery (or so she claimed). \n\n*“Yeah?”* Leslie’s voice when she answer the phone was so smoke-choked and aggressive that I almost hung up–\n\nBut I had Maia to consider. \n\n“Hey Leslie…you might not remember me, but maybe you remember my older sister, Maia?”\n\n*“What?! Who’s this?!”*  The crunching of Cheetos in the receiver was so loud I had to hold my phone away from my head. “Oh, you mean Maia from high school? The girl with that freaky disease?” \n\nMy hands clenched into fists. *So now my sister–who’d been the best goalie in the county, had one of the highest GPAs in her class, and always been there when her friends (like Leslie) needed a shoulder to cry on–was suddenly just “the girl with that freaky disease?!”*\n\n“I’m talking about Maia, Maia Beridze. Maia’s gotten a lot worse since high school, Leslie. She can’t talk and she barely leaves her bedroom. I was hoping…if it wouldn’t be too much trouble…maybe you could come by and see her?” \n\n“See her? Pfft!” Leslie scoffed, “I *saw* her just last night, at The Red Room*.* Damn, your sister’s got some *moves!* I barely recognized her!” I sat in stunned silence, sure that I’d misheard. The Red Room was a sketchy dance club on the other side of town…and my sister could barely leave her bed. *What on earth was going on?*\n\n“Are you *sure* that was *Maia* who you saw?” I finally stammered.\n\n“Yeah, she’s there, like, every night!”\n\n“I think you’re mistaking my sister for someone else. Maia is–”\n\n“Look, your big sis held my hair back while I puked in an ice cream carton at Billy Saville’s party. We went to that not-so-secret swimming spot down by the quarry every summer. There isn’t a *chance* that I wouldn’t recognize Maia! In fact–” Leslie paused, angry now “–I think it’s safe to say that *I* know Maia better than *you* ever will!” \n\nI hung up before I could say any of the words that were burning in my chest. I couldn’t risk alienating Leslie. Rude as she was, if what she’d said was true I might need her help later.\n\nAs much as I hated clubs, dancing, and everything to do with them, it looked like I was going to The Red Room.   \n\n\n  \n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

Darkness hangs over the forest as I wind my way up the tree-lined road. As we press deeper into this heavily wooded area of Long Island, there is little left to say. The bizarre happenings of the past few days now make sense to me. I finally understand why all these men perished in fires. In death, Akasha controls the element that took her life.\n\nSuddenly Darryl breaks the silence in the car. “I'm so sorry... I never meant to hurt anyone...”\n\nPart of me wants to punch him, but I suppress the urge. Adam can’t stand it anymore and asks, “You think this is going to change anything?” \n\nGood question.\n\n“I don’t know,“ I say. “Maybe once the world knows the truth, the killings will stop. Maybe Akasha will find peace.”\n\n“If I tell you where she’s buried, I’ll go to jail for life.”\n\n“Can you live with yourself, knowing that she’s out there killing anyone who answers her personal ad and is foolish enough to sleep with her? Every one of her victims will be on your conscience.”\n\nAdam shakes his head. He senses that I’m offering him the next best thing to absolution.\n\n“I can see why she went after Darryl, but why the others?” Adam asks. “They didn’t have anything to do with what happened that night.”\n\nIt’s a good point, and I’ve already given it some thought. “Akasha always got involved with men who weren’t emotionally available. She was looking for love in all the wrong places. Married men, guys in relationships... They’d use her and discard her. But not anymore. No one will ever love her and leave her again. Let the world beware.” \n\n“So why did Akasha spare you?”\n\nI just shake my head. I refuse to share my theory with Adam. What separates me from all her other victims is that I never slept with Akasha. Men betrayed Akasha after they’d gotten what they wanted. Death is allowing her to take revenge. But maybe there are rules she has to play by... I don’t know, but one thing I’m certain of — had I been seduced, I’d be dead now. Just another name on her ever-growing list of dead Tinder dates. \n\nIn a fatalistic voice, Adam declares that we’re here. I slow down and kill the engine. We get out of the vehicle and breathe the night air. The snow-laden pines seem alive, sickly moonlight casting a spooky glow on everything. \n\nAs we creep deeper into the woods, boots crunching over the ice, I let Adam lead the way. The beam of my flashlight flits through the darkness like a lost soul. The shovel dangles from Adam’s hand and rakes the snow.\n\nTerrible secrets seem to lurk in this forest. We’re about to unearth one of them. Tonight history is repeating itself, except in reverse. Last time it was Adam and his brother burying the evidence. This time it’s up to us to uncover the truth.\n\nAdam stops and raises his arm, pointing at a fat tree. “We buried her over there.”\n\nI stare at the vista before us and realize I’ve seen it before. These are the same trees and icy landscape on Akasha’s Facebook cover page. All along, her profile offered clues to her final resting place, but no one was able to put it all together.\n\nI nod and say, “Start digging.”\n\n“Please, don't make me do this.”\n\nMy withering gaze silences Adam. He stabs the shovel into the snow-covered mud and begins the dirty task ahead.\n\nHalf an hour later, Adam is standing in a shallow grave surrounded by a mound of ice-hardened soil. With an expression of mingled disgust and sadness, Adam steps back from the grave. I move closer. \n\nThe moment I spot the skeletal remains at the bottom of the hole, a chill claws its way down my spine. Up until this point it’s all been words alone. Here is the reality of what happened. This is why Akasha’s spirit isn’t at rest. \n\nBlackened bones protrude from the frozen earth like jagged teeth. A charred skull stares back at me. \n\n“Akasha...”\n\nI would swear the stench of burning meat is thickening around me, but it must be my imagination. \n\nAdam regards the remains with deep regret. “I'm so sorry,” he mutters under his breath, seeking forgiveness for his crime.\n\nPerhaps God is listening, but I have the feeling Akasha isn’t. I’m caught off guard as I spot a pink backpack next to the remains. I fish out the mud-encrusted backpack that Akasha was buried with. Following a hunch, I open the backpack and find… a cell phone. \n\nAkasha’s iPhone.\n\nThe screen and casing are cracked, and the battery should be dead but the screen flickers brightly in the cold night. The phone is running on a force other than electricity. \n\nWith horror I realize the phone is logged onto Tinder. Adam and Darryl smashed up Akasha’s cellphone pretty good, destroying the technology that would allow it to be geo-tracked, but they never anticipated the symbolic value of the device. Akasha’s destroyed cell phone was a link to the world of the living. A link that allowed her to interact and make connections and haunt our reality from beyond the grave. Tinder had killed her. But the dating app had also become the instrument of her unearthly vengeance. Her way of luring the living into her deadly curse.\n\nAs I try to wrap my head around it all, Adam whirls and takes off into the night. For a second I just stand there, too stunned to react, but I shake off my paralysis and tear off after him.\n\nI storm through the foreboding forest landscape, Akasha’s cell phone clutched in my hand. Part of me wonders how it could be working without power, but this doesn’t seem more fantastical than anything else I’ve experienced recently. \n\nI charge through the thick undergrowth, stumbling over icy rocks and jumping over banks of snow. My breath comes in adrenaline-fueled bursts as I chase after Adam. \n\nThe forest is flooded with the Honda’s headlights. I spot Adam, a grim silhouette etched blackly against their glow. His words reverberate through the night. “I never meant to hurt anyone!”\n\nThe tone of his voice worries me, and my concern is validated as I step closer. Adam is holding a jerry can in his hand. Before I can attempt to stop him, he douses himself with gasoline. The acrid-smelling liquid soaks his winter coat and pants, streaming down his face.\n\n“Stay back.”\n\nI do, understanding Adam’s intentions. All I can do is appeal to his crumbling sanity. I can’t allow him to succumb to the guilt that has tormented him for all these months. Adam hurls the emptied gas can in the snow and extricates a lighter from his pocket.\n\n“Adam, please don't.”\n\n“I was just trying to help my brother. I had no idea she was still alive. You gotta believe me!”\n\nI take one more cautious step toward Adam. \n\n“Adam, stop — I do believe you.”\n\n“I've been dreaming of her. Every night I close my eyes and see her burn.”\n\n“Everything’s gonna be alright...” I say the words even though I’m not convinced. I take two more steps, arms up and palms open.\n\n“I'm sorry,” he says with grave finality and I scream, “DON'T!”\n\nAdam isn't listening. He is beyond my reach. \n\nBeyond help.     \n\nHe fires up the lighter.\n\n“NOOO!”\n\nNight is turned into day as Adam transforms into a human torch. Flames engulf him the same way they devoured Akasha and her victims.\n\nI recoil in shock. \n\nAs the fire melts Adam's body, his screams of agony echo through the haunted forest. A forlorn plea for forgiveness that will go unanswered.\n\nI avert my gaze, unable to further bear witness to the horror. Mercifully, Adam’s death cries stop and his burning figure slumps forward. The only sounds now are the fire as it consumes what’s left of his body.\n\nStill reeling from the shock, I remember the phone in my hand. The screen has changed. Facebook Live is on and offers me a view of an apartment I’m all too familiar with. It’s Lynn’s place as viewed through the webcam of her desktop computer.\n\n*Akasha is going after my girl.*\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\nI navigate my car down an icy street, driving as fast as I dare. Getting pulled over or causing an accident won’t do Lynn any good. Before leaving Akasha’s gravesite, I used Adam’s phone to call the cops. I told them about Akasha and where they could find her, then promptly hung up.\n\nI made sure to wear my winter gloves to avoid leaving any fingerprints. I’m hoping the cops will think Adam called to confess before he killed himself. There should be nothing linking me to the scene. At least I hope so. Either way, I have more important concerns at the moment. I need to reach Lynn before Akasha attacks her. I fear that I’ll be too late, but I have to try.\n\nThe drive into Astoria feels like an eternity. I keep checking Akasha’s cell, but it has gone dark. What does that mean? Is it a good sign, or a bad omen? Does she know I found her grave and am now in possession of her phone?  What are the rules of engagement for ghosts?! \n\nThese are the insane questions that cycle through my mind as I whip down the road, hands clenched white around the steering wheel. \n\nI arrive at Lynn’s four-story apartment building just as one of the windows explodes. A fireball bursts out, dispersing into the winter night. \n\n*OH MY GOD!*\n\nA handful of workers and customers from the fruit and vegetable market across the street look up with shocked disbelief. The fire is spreading. While they gawk at it, I park the car and jump out, rushing toward the burning building. \n\nI pass through the main entrance but am met by a wall of fire in the staircase. Thick smoke stings my lungs. There is no way to make it up to the second floor and reach Lynn’s unit. \n\nOr is there? \n\nPanic growing, I retreat to the street. There might be another way. I move along the side of the structure with dark urgency. Smoke plumes from the windows. Weakening timbers screech under the fiery assault. \n\nI round the corner and zero in on the fire escape. Moments later, I’m climbing the rusting steps. As I reach the second floor, out of breath but driven by desperation, I pray I’m not too late. I find the window, wrap my jacket around my balled fist and punch through the glass. Shards slice through the fabric, but I ignore the pain. As I brush pieces of glass aside, I’m hit by a cloud of cloying smoke. I bring up my coat’s collar to cover my nose and mouth, slide the broken window open and climb into the building.\n\nInside, a howling world of fire awaits me. Flames and smoke are everywhere, the heat searing.\n\n“LYNN, WHERE ARE YOU?!”\n\nI surge down the hallway. My body hums with adrenaline. Every fiber of my being is urging me to run the other way, but my girl is trapped in this building and I’m not leaving without her.\n\n“Lynn, can you hear me? LYNN!”\n\nI close in on Lynn’s unit, eyes ticking back and forth, trying to penetrate the columns of smoke. Tongues of red and orange flame roil over the ceiling, crackling as they spread with supernatural speed. \n\nSuddenly, a voice cuts through the roar of the blaze. “*Mark...”*\n\nI whirl and spot my girlfriend further down the corridor. Smoke inhalation has taken its toll, and she’s fighting to stay conscious, but she’s otherwise unharmed.\n\nTwo quick strides later, I’m next to her. I give Lynn a quick hug before I grab her hand and pull her along. Her breathing lurches raggedly – who knows how much smoke is in her lungs already. She keeps staring at the burning staircase ahead. Akasha is nowhere to be seen, even though this must be her doing. A crumbling noise draws my attention. The staircase is collapsing. *Oh no.* I hope that everyone else in the building got out.\n\nI back away from the conflagration, mind racing. We’ll have to retrace my steps and use the fire escape.\n\nGood idea, except for one tiny problem. A wall of surging flames now blocks the way I came from. We’re trapped, the relentless ring of heat closing in around us.\n\nI clutch Lynn to my chest. She is trembling with mortal fear. She knows all too well what is about to happen. Death is approaching fast. \n\nA figure grows visible at the center of the inferno. Akasha. Her body is burning, flames swirling around her. Her hellish gaze finds me, and she *surges* toward us, almost as if she is made of fire herself. Her eyes sparkle with a dark yearning as she approaches. One second she is as beautiful as she was in life, another she is a map of bubbling burn scars. Her haunting visage changes back and forth with each step she takes. \n\nI want to run, but escape has ceased to be an option.   \n\nI must face Akasha.\n\n“I know what happened to you,” I say.\n\nAkasha draws nearer, my words falling on deaf ears.\n\n“I know about Darryl. How he lied to you... Just like all the others.”\n\nThis latest revelation elicits a reaction. Akasha slows her advance.\n\nI forge ahead. “I know how they would promise you love but always leave you afterwards. Akasha, I know what Darryl and Adam did to you.”\n\nAkasha grows still. Encouraged, I continue. “The cops already know what happened. Soon the world will learn the truth. Your story will be told. You can be at peace.”\n\nA frozen moment. The fire rages around us. In a matter of seconds it will envelop our flesh and force us to suffer the same terrible fate Akasha was forced to endure.  \n\n“Akasha, please. We’re innocent.” \n\nAkasha’s features grow masklike again. The old yearning and fury returns. Her blazing gaze daggers into me. A carpet of fire marks her continued approach. \n\nDespite my best efforts, I wasn’t able to reach her. \n\nI swap a glance with Lynn, then meet Akasha’s stare again.\n\n“You want me, don't you? If you can have me, will you let her go?”\n\n“Do you love me?” Akasha asks, her voice blending with the roar of the flames. It’s more of a demand than a question.\n\nSeizing the opportunity to save Lynn’s life, I say the words Akasha has been waiting to hear since the moment we met. But as I speak, my eyes never leave Lynn’s. My words may be directed at Akasha, but they’re meant for Lynn.\n\n“I love you...”\n\nTears stream down Lynn's cheeks. She senses the finality of what is happening here. \n\nThis isn't just a declaration of love. \n\nThis is goodbye.\n\nI turn toward Akasha and approach the fiery apparition before me. Tendrils of flame dance around us as we meet at the end of the hallway. \n\nBut Akasha’s attention remains fixed on Lynn's sobbing form... Somehow my words have achieved the opposite effect. Instead of lulling Akasha into the illusion that she has found true devotion, it has only made her painfully aware of what is really transpiring here.\n\n*I’m sacrificing my life to save the woman I love.*\n\nAkasha reaches for me but before her burning touch can roast my flesh, she lets out a piercing wail. A horrific sound filled with longing, despair and unrequited emotion. \n\nAnd suddenly I know what I must do.\n\nI pull out Akasha’s cell-phone from my pocket. \n\nAnd I toss it out the nearby window. \n\nMy eyes follow the falling phone as it shatters on the streets four stories below. \n\nAkasha’s wail intensifies. Her only link to the world of the living destroyed.\n\nThe wall of flame is sucked inward, balling into a giant fireball that suddenly extinguishes itself in a brilliant flash of light. \n\nLynn and I are left behind in the gutted ruins of her apartment building. The sirens of an approaching fire engine grow audible. All that matters is that Lynn is safe. Our bodies remain locked in a tight embrace. As we cling to each other, it feels like we’ll never ever let go.\n\n*Love burns you when it’s hot.*\n\nBut it can also save you.\n\n**THE END**",

        "text": "After our mother passed away a few months ago and the house was passed to us, Dean and I decided to sell it. I didn't remember at all that we had buried this time capsule in the garden back then. But Dean apparently did. And when he told me about it, the memory seemed to slowly come back. That's the thing about childhood memories. Some are so deeply etched that over the years they become the only stories you tell over and over again. Others - most of them - are simply forgotten. Or you repress them. Unless you are reminded of them. It's amazing what you still remember somewhere in the depths of your brain. \n\nWhen we finally found it and pulled the blue lacquered aluminium box out of the ground, I suddenly remembered it very clearly. I remembered how we came up with the idea and that we had asked our mother for permission. She thought it was strange but was pleased that for once we were getting on well together. I remembered how she smiled and looked for the old blue box in the shed in which our father had put nails. I remembered the rattling of the nails inside the box and them forming a pile on the wooden surface of the workbench as our mother poured them out. It was so clear and distinct in front of me that I found it almost frightening. This day had been beautiful, but certainly no more special than any other of the beautiful days we had in our childhood.\n\nStill, after it had all come back to me so clearly, I wondered about one thing: that the memory didn't go any further. It just seemed to... end there. We played, we had the idea, we asked our mother, she got us the box and then Dean and I set off. But where to? I had to have at least a rough memory of the rest after all that was back.\n\nI pulled the box out of the ground and Dean looked at me with shining eyes. The day was not as nice as the one when we had buried it. It was raining and we were completely soaked. At that moment it occurred to me that it had been totally nonsensical to look for the time capsule right now. Dean spoke to me about the capsule and I remembered it. But why did we start looking for it **instantly**? It was raining cats and dogs. All this flashed through my mind in a few seconds and already I was beginning to doubt my sanity. Why the hell was there a gap between the moment Dean told me about the capsule and the moment we found it?!\n\n\"Dean.\", I said, looking at him with a worried expression on my face.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe smiled and placed our capsule on a patch of grass left between the countless holes we had dug in the garden.\n\n\"Why don't I remember the capsule?\"\n\nHe looked at me in wonder.\n\n\"What do you mean you don't remember?\"\n\nI looked down at the blue capsule I now remembered very well and back up into his face.\n\n\"Well yes now I do. But... what did we put in it?\"\n\nAt this question, Dean apparently began to think. His smile slowly disappeared from his face.\n\n\"Um. I don't know, \" He shook his head. \"But isn't that the idea behind it?\"\n\nHe laughed. Somehow more nervous than his expression seemed to pretend.\n\nI, meanwhile, stared at the blue box while listening to the hollow patter of raindrops on it.\n\n\"Why were we looking for it now?\"\n\nDean was silent, staring at the box now too.\n\nFor a while neither of us said anything. I hadn't brought it up to him that something was wrong with my memory in the last few minutes or hours. But now he seemed to feel the same way. I felt uneasy and I didn't know why. And Dean seemed to feel the same way. I looked around at our old garden, which was now more brown than green, since up until that moment we had apparently dug it up like mad to find that capsule. I didn't remember it.\n\n\"Dean, how long have we been looking for the capsule?\"\n\nI tried not to look too worried, maybe this was all just something like a dejavu effect only in reverse, but I couldn't seem to manage it. Dean also looked around and I saw fear spreading across his face. He was doubting his sanity now too, or so I thought. He looked at me with glazed eyes. I wasn't sure if there were tears in his eyes or if it was the rain. For a moment it looked like time was standing still.\n\n\"I don't think we should open that thing,\" he said in a broken voice.\n\nEither he remembered what was inside or he was just too scared of it now. I laughed nervously.\n\n\"Come on.\"\n\nI looked back down at the wet blue box between us.\n\n\"I mean...\"\n\nWhat was wrong here? There now seemed to be an ominous aura emanating from the nondescript blue box that had once been home to nails on the shelf in the shed just a few feet from us.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Dean said.\n\nI looked at him uncertainly.\n\n\"We should at least take a look inside.\"\n\nThere were clearly tears in Dean's eyes now.\n\n\"You know what's in it, don't you?\", I asked.\n\n\"No. Please just dig it back in. I don't feel comfortable with it.\"\n\nDean's voice broke. I looked at him and something inside me screamed at me to listen.\n\n\"At least tell me why I shouldn't open it… It was your idea after all.\"\n\nDean thought for a moment, then stood up and looked down at me as I held the capsule in my hand.\n\n\"All right open it. But without me.\" he said. He seemed to have his emotions back under control now. I was confused, what the hell was going on? My brother started walking towards the house.\n\n\"Dean! What the hell are you doing? Where are you going?\"\n\nHe didn't answer and kept walking. I was completely stumped by now. And I wanted to know what was in that capsule. As I looked down at the box in my hands I heard the patio door slam behind me. Dean was gone. But I couldn't just leave that stupid box unopened now. What could be so bad in it? After all, we had just dug up the whole **garden** for it and now I was supposed to bury it again? I took a deep breath. Whatever was in it seemed to really worry Dean, which made this inconspicuous little box scare the hell out of me. Slowly I opened the lid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first thing I pulled out was an old spinning top. I remembered it immediately. But until that moment I had completely forgotten about it. Dean and I had played with it all the time. On the wooden floor in our house, we would circle it along the grooves between the floorboards, taking turns trying to make it come farther. It drove our mother crazy. Our mother was crying. I didn't know why. The top kept spinning on the floor and I remembered Dean and I trying to comfort her.\n\nI pulled a wristwatch out of the capsule. It was our father's. He had given it to me when I had been badly injured one summer and had to spend a few weeks in hospital. But why? Why couldn't I remember it?\n\n\"Take good care of it.« he said, pressing it into my hand. \"Then it’ll take care of you too.\"\n\nI didn't know what that meant then any more than I do now. And it was only now that I remembered. Dean was sitting in a chair opposite the bed, playing yo-yo. Those things were cool back then. I don't remember how long I was in the hospital. I guess at some point I was well again. I wish I could have asked Dean at that moment why I had been in the hospital. He was probably still in the house. I’d ask him later.\n\nThen I pulled out a yo-yo. Dean's yo-yo. He must have put it in. I didn't seem to have any special memories of that. I turned the tin over and shook it. A folded piece of paper fell out. I picked it up and unfolded it. My handwriting was visible in smudged ink.\n\n\"Dear Dean,\" was written at the top of the note, which must have just turned out to be a letter addressed to my brother. But why would I write a letter to Dean and put it in our shared time capsule? This felt wrong. Something wasn't right here. I wanted to go in and get Dean. I wanted to talk to him about it. About this capsule. About Mom. About him.\n\nInstead, I started reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I began to read the letter, reality came crashing down on me.\n\nI remembered the day I buried the capsule. I remembered the confused look on my mother's face when I asked her permission to bury the capsule. I remembered her soft smile and the wrinkles around her reddened eyes as she took the box from the shelf and emptied it. I remembered putting the top in the box because I didn't want to play with it alone. And how I put in a yo-yo for Dean and my watch for Dad. I remembered writing these lines for my brother.\n\nI looked up from the letter and turned to the house.\n\n\"Dean?\", I cried with tears in my eyes and dropped the letter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-\n\n*Dear Dean,*\n\n*I hope you are well where you are now. You forgot your yo-yo. Mom says you and Dad aren't coming back, but I don't believe it. Why would you leave without us? I'll definitely look forward to seeing you again. The top's no fun without you, so I'll put it in the box, too. It was Grandma's idea, I thought it was weird, Mom did too, but we can dig it out when you get back.*\n\n*Tell dad I love him, bye!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Rory*\n\n\\-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sobbed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What are you doing here?\", I heard Dean's voice behind me.\n\nI wheeled around and saw Dean standing on the patio. What was going on here? Were my memories wrong? Or was *Dean* wrong?\n\n\"W... What?\", I stammered.\n\n\"We were supposed to meet at the diner at noon today.\"\n\nI remembered that. Now I was completely confused. But there Dean was, standing in front of me.\n\n\"I...\" it burst out of me. I didn't know what to say.\n\nDean sighed.\n\n\"Anyway, come in, we need to get rid of this house,\" it said, closing the door behind it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ve now spent the evening with \"Dean\" and he is now sleeping in the room next door. I don't know what it is, but I think the Dean who reminded me of the capsule and dug it out with me was really my brother. Dean, who died almost 20 years ago, and the thing next door thinks I don't remember him dying. How can that be?! Why am I only now remembering my own brother's death? And what is it pretending to be? What does it want?\n\nI'm writing this because I hope someone here believes me. I'm beginning to doubt my sanity. Maybe it's really me going insane and I should talk to Dean about it. Please help me. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRory.",

He certainly would be the right age, having disappeared in the summer of 1999, at age 20. I didn’t really remember him from that summer, although he had been the one to give my mother the key to The Wet Lady’s cottage. It was because of him that I nearly drowned as a child, that my nights were haunted by empty eye sockets and dripping, rotting fingers. I remembered the hurt in Martina’s voice as she spoke of her guilt, that for a moment she had averted her attention from the motel and because of it, a college kid had died. As the shock of his revelation began to fade, anger welled up in its place. \n\n“Twenty years,” I said, my voice rising in volume. “It’s been over twenty years and you couldn’t tell Martina that you were alive? You had to screw with her with the beer and the cigarettes?”\n\nHe ran his fingers through his graying hair and clenched his fists in frustration.\n\n“I couldn’t,” he said, as though the words were difficult for him.\n\n“In the old tales,” René said, appearing at my side, “the *loup garou* could tell no one of his curse. Is that true, Mr. Hubert?”\n\nJake stared at his feet, his face inscrutable. He looked at René and then to me. He nodded slowly. \n\n“I didn’t want to hurt Martina.”\n\n“When did you meet her?” René asked.\n\n“Martina? I—”\n\n“No,” René interrupted. “*Her*.”\n\nJake became agitated.\n\n“I can’t talk about that.”\n\n“We saw the shrine. I know you are in her thrall. But we need you to talk to us. I think you owe Nora that, at least.”\n\nHe shook his head and rummaged under the dirty flannel blankets covering the bed. He retrieved a carton of cigarettes and shoved them in his back pocket.\n\n“I don’t owe you people anything,” he spat. He left the cabin, leaving the shoddily constructed door swinging behind. \n\nRené started after him, but I grabbed his arm.\n\n“Let me go,” I said. “You still have the silver, right?”\n\nHe hesitated, not quite in agreement with my plan. After a couple of moments, he handed me the bangles, which were… in desperate need of cleaning. \n\n“I’ll be nearby,” he said. \n\nI found Jake in the back of the cabin, sitting at a weathered picnic table, smoking a cigarette. \n\n“Mind if I join you?” I asked tentatively. He made a grunt of assent. We sat there in silence for a while.\n\n“I met you when you were a little kid,” he said quietly.\n\n“A long time ago.”\n\n“Has it really been twenty years?”\n\nI nodded.\n\n“Almost twenty-four, actually.”\n\nHe took another drag of his cigarette, eyes fixed on nothing.\n\n“Well, shit.”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\nMore silence. He was clearly not used to human conversation. \n\n“I’m going to die within the year,” I said softly. “I saw the head in the fog.”\n\nHe sat up straighter, eyebrows knitted in concern.\n\n“What do you want from me then? Go live your life while you have it. And if you want my advice, ditch the dead guy.” He scowled at a spot in the distance where he undoubtedly could sense René.\n\n“He’s helping me. The motel is mine now. My uncle Jim is dead. My dad is dead. Martina is dead.”\n\nA look of sadness crossed his face.\n\n“Martina and Jim? Dead?”\n\nI nodded. “It’s just me. And I don’t have much time. The entities at the motel are becoming more aggressive.”\n\n“Entities, huh. You mean like me?”\n\n“Yes. That’s why I need you to talk to me.”\n\nHe shuddered.\n\n“I can’t. You heard your boyfriend. Part of the curse.”\n\nI chuckled embarrassedly. \n\n“He’s not my boyfriend. Ever think that maybe he can help you? Earlier we stumbled across that bone…thing. René called it a shrine. I heard it call to me, beckoning me to touch it, to lie down before it. I couldn’t stop myself until René did his vampire mind thing and broke the enchantment. Maybe he could do that for you.”\n\n“You heard the shrine,” he asked apprehensively. “It called to you, and you were able to resist?”\n\n“Only after René intervened.”\n\n“I suppose I can let him try,” he said reluctantly, stamping out his cigarette on the table.\n\n“Thank you, Jake. Thank you.”\n\nI waved my hand in the general direction where I suspected René was listening and he appeared in an instant. Jake rolled his eyes.\n\n“Okay, this little supernatural species alpha male feud ends right now. Do you both understand me?”\n\nJake chuckled dryly.\n\n“Fine.”\n\nRené continued to scowl at the werewolf.\n\n“René?” \n\nHe nodded.\n\n“Very well,” he said. \n\n“Do you think you can try and undo whatever enchantment prevents him from talking?”\n\n“I can certainly try. It might be unpleasant. But if Hubert here is willing…”\n\n“I’ll do it for the kid,” Jake said gruffly.\n\n“Thank you,” I said.\n\nRené sat down next to Jake and lifted his chin so that he was facing him directly. Jake emitted a low growl.\n\n“Relax!” René commanded. Jake’s face slackened and at once appeared almost peaceful. “Look at me.” \n\nThey locked eyes. A minute passed, maybe two. I noticed Jake’s eyes began to twitch. His mouth opened and closed. René was concentrating deeply, his jaw clenched. Jake tried to jerk his head away with a groan, but René brought his hands to the sides of his face and turned him back. From head to toe his body began to shake with escalating severity.  His eyes rolled back in his head and he let out a bloodcurdling cry. Both men were thrown to the frozen grass as if pushed by an unseen force.\n\nI rushed over to where they lay. René groaned, but sat up, his face slightly gaunt with exertion. Jake panted on the ground, his eyes closed, his breath ragged. He blinked his eyes open, but he still appeared dazed. René helped him up and sat him back on the picnic table bench. \n\n“Are you okay?” I asked.\n\n“I don’t know,” Jake said. \n\n“She’s in very deep,” René said, voice weary. “But I may have been able to peel away at least some of her influence.”\n\nJake retrieved his lighter from his jeans pocket and took out another cigarette. He offered the carton to René. René took it, a smile of surprise crossing his face. Jake lit his and handed the lighter to René.\n\n“Thanks,” René said. “I needed this.” He offered the carton to me, but I shook my head. \n\n“Try saying something simple, Jake,” I asked. “Just say ‘I’m a werewolf.’”\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\n“Here it goes. I’m a …werewolf.” His face broke out into a smile, a true smile for the first time. René sighed in relief. “I don’t know how far this goes, but I feel…lighter somehow. The weight in my chest, it’s not as heavy. I’m going to try talking now. You’re going to have to forgive me, if sometimes I can’t find the words. It’s been a while since…well…”\n\n“I understand, Jake. It’s okay.”\n\n“It all started that summer, in 1999, when the pool I had been lifeguarding at decided to close early. Kid got hurt or something. Liability, maybe. I can’t remember. I thought I could get back some of that lost summer income before going back to Clarkson, so I started asking around. Gas station needed an extra guy for a bit, so I was going to go with that until my dad came home one day said his buddy from high school owned a motel and needed someone to help out while his manager was out of town for a family emergency. Pay was triple what the gas station was offering. I didn’t think twice. My dad told him I was interested.\n\nJim Calnon came over to chat with me. I still remember sitting with him on the deck, sun beating down on us. He had been friendly when he introduced himself, but when we sat down to talk, he got real serious. He asked me if I believed in ghosts.\n\nI was surprised. It didn’t seem like he was pulling my leg at all. So, I told him that we had a ghost, right there in our house. When I was a little kid I would lay in bed at night and knock on the wall behind me. There always would be a knock back, even though there was nothing on the other side of the wall. I’d hear footsteps going up and down the stairs. One time, when I was sixteen, I opened the bathroom door to find an old lady in a hospital gown staring back at me, with cloudy, dead eyes. Turns out an old lady died in the house before we moved in. She was never malevolent. In fact, she always struck me as the kind, grandmotherly type. Looking out for me, you know?\n\nJim seemed please to hear that. He told me that the motel was haunted too. But that the things there, were a bit more…difficult to deal with. He said if I was still up for it, I could meet with his manager. It sounded cool to me, and the pay was incredible. \n\nSo, I met Martina. Martina is…I guess was…” his voice faltered.\n\n“A tour de force.” I added, my eyes brimming with tears.\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, she was. She gave me a lot of tough love, but I needed it. Anyway, I had just finished a couple days of training with Martina at Calnon’s when I met a girl. I was picking up some milk at a convenience store when she came up to me asking for a light. She looked about my age, she had highlights in her hair and wore this black spaghetti strap tank and this pair of cool, metallic cargo pants, just a gorgeous girl. I couldn’t stop staring at her eyes, they were green and just magnetic.\n\nShe was really easy to talk to, too. She didn’t seem to mind my awkwardness at all. We talked about school, she told me she was doing engineering at Clarkson too, which I found a bit odd since I had never seen her in any of my classes and I would have certainly remembered her. She made some excuse about studying abroad in France or something, but honestly I would have forgiven her anything at that point. She told me her name was Cate and when she gave me her number, I thought I was in love with her.\n\nI tried to pay attention to Martina.  I tried to study the notebook. I really did. But then I’d think of Cate and all was lost. She wanted to spend time with me, a lot of time. Any time I wasn’t at the motel, I had to be with her. My parents didn’t care much, they thought it was great I had a girlfriend. Cate would find these romantic, clandestine places where we would make love. It was thrilling and all consuming and I didn’t care that everything else in my life seemed to be slipping away.\n\nBy the time Martina left, it wasn’t enough for me to just see her after work. We needed to be together all day. When she wasn’t with me, I felt empty, almost light-headed, like I couldn’t focus.  I remember the day you came in with your mom. I tried to pull myself together for Jim’s sister-in-law, but all I could think of was Cate coming back with a six pack, wondering which room we could use for the night.”\n\n“You gave my mom the wrong key. I almost died.”\n\nHis face fell, the old shame rushing back to him. \n\n“I’m so sorry, Nora. You were just a kid.”\n\n“So were you, Jake. So were you.”\n\nHe smiled sadly.\n\n“I did the payment for that fish lady. Marbles, a perch? I remember that clearly. Scary looking fucker. But I felt so brave, so masculine, I couldn’t wait to brag about it to Cate. I told her about everything at the motel. I should have been alarmed that she barely reacted. No normal person would listen to all that and not at least call me nuts. She just smiled and nodded, complimenting me, telling me how incredible I was.”\n\nRené laughed mirthlessly. “She knows what men love to hear.”\n\nJake gave him a look of surprise, then understanding. He nodded and continued.\n\n“By the night of the full moon, we were pretty much living at the motel. I called home occasionally, lied to my parents about how busy the job was and how I would just crash in a vacant room after my shift. Cate and I would take turns getting beer, pizza, and cigarettes. I read the notebook entry for Cottage 13 with her on my lap. \n\n‘This one is really easy,’ I told her. She watched me with a huge grin on her face as I dragged the deer carcass to the cottage door. By sunset, I had already consumed an entire six pack of beer by myself. We were lying in a bed in the motel, naked together, when I began to hear the howling. Cate didn’t flinch. In fact, she looked a little bored. And this howling…well, you know, right? A normal person would have been alarmed.\n\nShe turned over to face me and had this weird look in her eyes.\n\n‘Can’t you shut that thing up?’\n\n‘What? We’re supposed to stay inside.’\n\n‘I can’t stand that sound. Can’t you just take the gun the old lady keeps in the safe and take care of it? Didn’t she give you combination?’\n\n‘Yeah, but it’s not like that’s a stray dog out there.’\n\nShe pursed her lips with disappointment which filled me with panic. The thought of making her unhappy, even for a moment, made me want to vomit.\n\n‘If you’re too scared, it’s okay,’ she said with a smirk. \n\n‘I’m not scared.’\n\n‘Then what are you waiting for?’ Her face was defiant, but calm, though I noticed her nostrils flared in annoyance. I reached for a half-empty can of beer on the nightstand and drained it in one gulp.\n\n‘Fine. I’ll go.’\n\nShe smiled, in a way that freaked me out. But I was too elated that she was happy with me again to care.\n\nI didn’t know anything about guns except for the basic orientation Martina had given me. I opened the safe and at least had the sense to grab that silver.\n\nBy the time I got out there, the howling had stopped and I started feeling hopeful I could return to Cate and tell her the thing was gone. But I was wrong. Dead wrong. \n\nI walked around the property, gun loaded and ready. Occasionally, I would come across a piece of the deer, a leg here, an ear there. As I bent down to examine them, I began to have the suspicion that I was being watched. I could hear panting coming from somewhere around me, like that of a large dog. \n\nThe wolf leapt out of seemingly nowhere and pinned me to the ground, burying its teeth into my shoulder. I could hear it hit the bone in its frenzy. I managed to free my hand underneath it’s belly and pushed the silver into it with all my might. It howled in pain and removed its jaw from my shoulder allowing me to drag myself away momentarily. With my good arm I grasped the gun that had fallen in the attack and aimed, balancing against my other arm which was completely numb from my wound. I fired and somehow managed to hit it, just under the neck. \n\nI was frozen in shock, watching the thing gasp and sputter in pain, my own wound so horrifying, I felt like I wasn’t in my own body anymore. The werewolf shuddered and its sounds became more haggard, slower. The limbs shrunk down to human arms and legs, the face was now that of a man’s, beard and hair as white as moonlight. He must have been in his late sixties, perhaps early seventies. He coughed blood and stared at me with a mad look in his eyes.\n\nJust as I felt I was about to lose consciousness, I saw a familiar figure standing between me and the old werewolf. It was Cate, but not as I knew her. She was draped in a gauzy black robe, her hair no longer had fake orange highlights, but fell to her knees in dark, silky waves. Her stare was terrible. Its hard to describe. So terrible and beautiful, I wanted to gouge out my own eyes. She was smiling, but it wasn’t the smile I knew. She smiled with black teeth, she threw her head back and laughed with a black tongue.\n\nThe old man cried out and reached for her.\n\n‘Please, please, save me, my beloved, my only object of worship,’ he wept. She looked at him with disgust. She began to walk towards me, under her bare feet the grass scorched and withered. \n\n‘Good boy, Jake,’ she said with that terrible smile. She bent down and caressed my cheek, patted my hair. She took the gun out of my hands. With a cruel laugh, she aimed at the old man, still sobbing and begging her with a weak voice. She pulled the trigger and his head flew backwards. He fell to the ground, dead.\n\nI was too terrified to scream. Cate tossed the gun to the grass. She observed me trembling at her feet and raised her hand into a fist. Despite my weakness, despite my gaping wound, my body rose into a kneeling position. She placed a palm over my forehead and pressed down. My body exploded into a fiery pain.  \n\nThe wound on my shoulder healed, but my skin felt hot to the touch, as though I were suffering from a high fever. It began to itch, as though from the inside, and I clawed at myself for relief. My bones felt as though someone was tearing them from their ligaments and rearranging them at will. Now, I screamed. I screamed and screamed until my scream wasn’t a scream at all any more. It was the howl of a wolf, of something unnatural.\n\nShe laughed as though nothing in the world delighted her more than my suffering. I was panting at her feet, no longer human. She stroked my fur with pleasure and produced what looked like a silver collar. The cries that escaped me when she clamped it around my neck were even more awful.\n\n‘One must always carefully train new pets. Lest they disobey their masters. Isn’t that right, my little wolf? Will you be a good dog?’\n\nMy senses were addled by the pain and the effect of my transformation. In that form, I could not think as a man, but as an animal. I tried to nod my head in assent. She removed the collar, but before I could recover, I felt as though I had been swept up in a swirling vortex. \n\nWe were hurtling through the sky, she and I, her robe whipping around her, her body reveling in the moonlight. A dark mist bore us away, at times disturbed by faces of apparitions in agony, ghostly men and women begging in plaintive voices in every language. \n\nI next found myself here on this island, a man once more. Cate stood before me, dressed as she once did when I thought she was a human girl, a mocking smile on her face. We were in the clearing. You know the one? I was naked, shivering in front of that thing, the tower of bones. \n\n‘This is your home now, dog.’ She said, her voice like the hissing of a snake in my ears. She told me the terms of my service to her. On the full moon, I would transform. If it was anywhere else besides the Calnon property, she would punish me. If I tried to run away, she would punish me. If I did not cut my hand every night at sunset and place it on the shrine of bones, she would punish me. For that was how she knew I was where I was supposed to be. \n\n‘I will bind your tongue so that you may not utter a word of your curse to anyone. If you even dare to approach your friends, your family, I will put them down as easily as I did that old useless man. Do you understand, you miserable creature?’\n\nI nodded. What else could I do? With that she was gone and I was alone. I found the old man’s cottage, slept in his bed. I realized the only food I could consume was raw meat. During the days, I would take the old man’s boat and haunt the dumpsters of grocery stores, stealing the discarded meat. \n\nOn that first full moon, I returned to Calnon’s. Almost as soon as I stepped foot on the property, the transformation took place, even more painful and agonizing than the one before. I consumed the deer carcass, as grateful as a beast could be. I tried to think of my family, but could focus on nothing with the mind of the wolf. Then I remembered Martina, and even in that state, I could still feel guilt. Just before sunrise, as the animal began to recede within me, I tore a piece of wax paper from the deer carcass and tried to write in blood. I tried to write what had happened to me, but Cate had been right. I could not. \n\nI thought I had a clever solution. I thought that surely this was a way she could understand that it was me, that I wasn’t dead. I wrote asking for smokes and Labatt’s. And at every full moon thereafter, they were there. But now you say that Martina did not understand. That all this time, she thought I was mocking her. That saddens me greatly.\n\nSometimes, she comes for me. This being I once knew as Cate. She transforms me and I travel with her as her dog. Now I simply know her as the Mistress.”\n\nJake hung his head in his hands and I knew he had finished his story. René sat with his arms folded, likely consumed by his own memories.\n\n“What happened on that last full moon, Jake?” I asked. “Why did you try to lure me out?”\n\n“I didn’t. I don’t have that kind of power.  But that night was different from the others. I felt almost possessed by rage, like I had to get at whatever was inside of that cottage, as though my life depended on it.”\n\n“It was she who lured you, Nora,” René said. “I would not be surprised if all the late attempts on your life had been at her behest and under her power.”\n\n“Why doesn’t she just do it herself? Why bother?”\n\n“Where would the fun be in that?” Jake said bitterly. \n\nI turned to René but he was looking into the thick growth of trees. The color drained from Jake’s face and he rose, facing the same direction as René. Then I began to hear it too, a creaking sound followed by a sickening thud, as though something was approaching. I spotted a large white figure through the trees. The creaking was the sound of hundreds of bones bending and cracking, held together by thick roots that laced the thing like veins. \n\nRené turned to us.\n\n“Run to the boat!”\n\nBefore I could react, a giant root thrust its way through the wooden picnic table at which we had just been sitting moments ago. René grabbed my arm and we began to run. A root grabbed my ankle and I fell hard against the frozen ground, knocking the wind out of me. René tried to tear at it, but it was too strong. He fumbled in his jacket and took out a pocket knife, but before he could pierce the root I saw him lifted away from me. I turned my body as much as I could and saw the shrine of bones before us, eyes of the skull of the stag that crowned it illuminated with a green glow. The roots were its limbs, and René struggled before it, suspended in its clutches. \n\nJake tried to free me as well, with about as much success as René. The thing before us began to pulse with a soundless energy and my body erupted in pain. It felt as though my internal organs were about to burst, the pressure was so great. I could see the energy affected René and Jake as well. Jake fell to the ground, writhing in pain and I noticed that his arms began to lengthen, his hands were becoming the claws of the beast once more.\n\n“Jake!”  I screamed.  “You have to resist!”\n\nI noticed that his lighter had fallen out of his jeans pocket and an idea occurred to me. With all my strength I stretched my arm in its direction. The root at my ankle had begun to squeeze. The lighter was just beyond my finger, I could barely touch the bottom. I steeled myself, knowing that if I panicked, I could flick it away even further. The pain was increasing, but I took a deep breath. Clenching my teeth, tears streaming down my face I was able to lock on to the lighter with two fingers and brought it into the palm of my hand. It took all of my remaining strength to sit up and set the root that held me aflame.\n\nIt ignited immediately. The thing moaned with a terrible cry. I watched as the flames snaked their way through the roots that held it together as though it were doused in gasoline. The pulsing energy had stopped and I turned to Jake who now was able to stop his transformation. The flames shot out over the roots holding René, hitting him with a giant fireball before releasing him. With a cry, I realized that he was on fire.\n\nAs the bone shrine collapsed around us, ran to him. I tore off my coat and tried to snuff out the flames, Jake kicking dirt over them. Finally, the fire had been extinguished, but a significant amount of René’s body from his chest downward had been charred. I waited for his body to start healing, but the process appeared to be much slower than for a flesh wound.\n\n“We need to get back to the boat,” René gasped. Jake lifted him over his shoulder and we ran the rest of the way. He lowered René carefully down and I jumped in, grabbing the thermos he had left inside and bringing it to his lips. As René drank gratefully, Jake undid the mooring and began to paddle.\n\nJust as the first signs of sunrise appeared in the sky, we arrived back the motel, a vampire, a werewolf, and a girl doomed to die, wondering what we had just done.\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wine_Dark_Sea_1239/)",

        "text": "Within a blink, I was there, and my vision was distorted at first.\n\n\nI was in a room. A bedroom. Unfamiliar and frightening. The floorboards creeked with terrifying effect. \n\n\nThe room was practically empty, barring the old and rusted bed with the heavily soiled mattress on top. Maybe it wasn't rust...maybe it was, blood?...One thing's for sure, this room was designed for nightmares.\n\n\nThere was just one window and one door. I pushed down on the handle and rattled back and forth.\n\n\n*Damnit. Locked.*\n\n\n\"We have to find a key.\" Said a familiar voice from the corner of the room. \"Start looking.\"\n\n\nIt was my friend, Tony, who was now kneeling on the dust-filled floor and frantically searching under the bed. \n\n\n\"An-Anything?\" I asked.\n\n\n\"Errm...No...No, there's nothing here.\" He stood back up and looked around. He knew this place better than I did. \n\n\n\"But, you've been here before, right?\" I asked.\n\n\n\"Yeah, but it changes place everytime, so I never know where to look. So, you need to help me, ya know, before we run out of time and they show up.\"\n\n\n\"Shit, sorry. It's just, it's a lot creepier than I imagined.\"\n\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, just come on. Find the key.\"\n\n\nWe ripped up floorboards until our fingers seemed to bleed, and we tore away at the mattress until there was nothing but shreads. But...nothing.\n\n\n\"Okay...the last place to try,\" Said Tony, \"is the window...but, its dangerous.\"\n\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\n\"It allows them to get in the house faster.\"\n\n\n\"How much faster?\"\n\n\n\"...Immediately.\"\n\n\nI walked quite briskly towards the window.\n\n\n\"Dude, wait, we're not prepared yet.\"\n\n\nI was at the window staring out. My fingers lightly resting on the latch. \"I...I think...I think I can see them...Shit! Oh shit! Dude, dude, I can see them! They're coming!\" In my frantic moment, I accidently knocked the window latch, causing it to fly wide open. \n\n\n*TING!*\n\n\nA small metal object dropped to the floor between my feet.\n\n\n\"The key!\" I shouted.\n\n\n\"Yes! Come on, quick!\" Tony shouted back. \"We need to get downstairs!\"\n\n\nI could hear them bashing down the doors as I put the key in the lock. I could hear them breaking windows and scuttling around the house.\n\n\n*CLUNK*\n\n\nThe door finally unlocked...We could hear them coming up the stairs, and Tony gulped hard.\n\n\n\"It's too late...They're here.\"\n\n\nThere was a moment of silence before they burst through the door. There were hundreds of them; A constant stream of the undead, all with melted skin and a strong taste for human flesh.\n\n\nThey got Tony instantly. His blood splattered and sprayed across the room with every bite. When they'd finished, his body disappeared, and the diseased undead were now all facing me.\n\n\nTrapped in the corner of the room, with no weapons and no Tony, I took the easy way out...I pressed the button and took off my headset...\n\n\n\"What the hell, dude!\" Said Tony, who was sat next to me on the couch. \"Okay, lets go again, but this time, don't pussy out and exit the game!\"",

        "text": "I was in 8th grade when the pandemic struck the Philippines and it was a month right before the school year ended. It really sucked since our class was only together for almost 2 years. For the next two years, we only had online classes through Zoom which was kinda okay thankfully due to the teachers working hard to make everything work smoothly. \n\nFast forward to last year when I finished 10th grade and I'm going to be an 11th grader. Our teacher then announced that starting the next school year, we would finally have F2F classes although online classes may also be done at the discretion of the teacher. I was ecstatic since after those two whole years of boring online classes, I can finally meet my classmates again in person. \n\nThe week before classes start, the teacher announced who will be our classmates, what subjects we will have and most especially the section where students will belong. The school was a simple building; beige in color, a hallway in the middle and stairs at the end. It is only 5 floors tall. 7th graders are on the 1st floor, 8th graders on the 2nd floor and so on. On the 5th floor however, the classrooms there are for both 11th and 12th graders since accordingly, the number of students for those two levels is less than half of the number of students in, say, 7th grade. Lucky enough for me, my section is the room right after the stairs on the last floor.\n\nHere comes the first day of class and I was too stupid to not put an alarm clock on my phone. I woke up then checked my phone. \n\n\"7:10 AM\"\n\nMy classes start at 7:30 AM\n\nI sprang out of the bed like a catapult, bathed, ate breakfast and kissed my parents goodbye. I rode a taxi to the school because it was 7:43 AM already and the taxi was the fastest transportation available at that time. I arrived at the school and ran up the stairs.\n\nI was in such a hurry that I was too busy noting what floor I was on. All I know is that I had to get to the last floor and sprint right through the first room. Alas! That's what I did. Right after I reached the end of the stairs, I quickly turned to the room I should be in.\n\nHowever, something simply clicked on me and I suddenly stopped. I had no idea why I had that feeling. Then, right when I stopped, I noticed my classmates were just sitting still, looking at the whiteboard.\n\n\"Is the teacher already here?\", I asked myself. But I see no teacher nor hear anyone talking. I'm already creeped out by the stillness and the silence of this class. Because I did not want to make a noise, I slowly walked to a vacant chair right at the back of the classroom. There was also a student right beside where I sat. I was about to ask him whether or not they were just waiting for the teacher when the teacher entered the classroom.\n\n\"Good morning, ma'am\", we greeted her in chorus as we stood up.\n\nShe simply nodded twice. The first as a reply, the second as a sign for us to sit down.\n\nI thought, \"Oh ok, maybe they were just nervous earlier\". The teacher then proceeded to write our lesson at the whiteboard while she explained at the same time. I thought she was pretty cool until she was going way too fast for me to absorb the information. I looked to my side to see if my seatmate is as confused as I am. However he seems unfazed. In fact, all of them looked unfazed. When the teacher asks if we understood, my classmates simply say yes.\n\nAm I getting dumb?\n\nIs this what online classes has made me into? \n\nI was getting anxious as to why I can't catch up with the others. \n\nWas the teacher too fast or am I just slow?\n\nJust when I had these thoughts, I heard my teacher yell my name. I quickly responded and stood up.\n\n\"Did you understand the lesson?\"\n\nI was not even able to inhale completely when she just screamed. She stood up, looked at me and ran out of the class, all the while she was screaming. I don't know if I should feel embarrassed or scared or confused. Before I could sort out my thoughts, my seatmate grabbed my hand and pulled it down, signaling me to sit.\n\nI was about to talk to him again when another teacher came in. He was rather calm and was even making jokes, albeit none in our class laughed in response. He then gave us some papers for a diagnostic test to see how much we know about the lesson.\n\nI was halfway answering the test when my pen ran out of ink. I probably did not notice my pen running out of ink when I just grabbed it before leaving home. I tapped the shoulder of the classmate in front of me and asked if she had an extra pen. \n\nOf course, she did not respond.\n\nI raised my hand to call the attention of my teacher. I asked him if he has a pen. Right before I could finish saying pen, he suddenly laughed insanely loud, like a person shouting HAHAHA. He slapped the table and was trembling so much. He was laughing so hard, he had his head looking up and opening his mouth very wide, it was surreal. I could see the cheeks stretching before he walked out of the classroom. I had no idea what it was, but my seatmate pulled me down to my chaie again and lent me a pen. I don't even know if I should finish the test. Everything is too weird. However, I decided to continue the test.\n\nI reached the last question where it asked, \"Explain the moeajka kdksla jcos\" (not exact since I only remembered it was jumbled letters). I was about to ask my seatmate what his last question was when another teacher walked in the class. This time, she looked very proper and had a grin on her face. Without any warnings, she suddenly called my name. I stood up.\n\n\"Can you explain for a little bit about [redacted]?\"\n\nThat was pretty obvious. I answered the questions and she remarked it as correct. However, she did not make me sit down. She simply expounded my answer and continued to write on the whiteboard with a red marker pen that has the same shade as her lipstick.\n\nJust like my pen, her marker pen soon ran out of ink. She asked the whole class as to who has a marker. No one responded.\n\nSuddenly, she grabbed her left index finger with her right hand and snapped it off. There was lots of blood and I was just beyond shocked. She wrote on the board as she was using her severed fingers like a marker pen.\n\n\"What the actual f*ck\", I said under my breath.\n\nPerhaps a bit too loud.\n\nBecause the teacher stopped writing and called me as to what I said. She turned her head towards me.\n\nWhen I said a turn, I meant a 180° turn without moving her body.\n\nI'm too freaked out by this. I did not know what to say.\n\nWith all of these, my seatmate raised his hand and took the blame, saying that it was him who said that. The teacher made him go in front of her. Just when he did, he immediately hugged the teacher tight, pushed her to a wall, and shouted run.\n\nHe was not looking at me when he did it, but I'm sure he meant that I should run. Of course, without hesitation, I bolted out of the door and ran down the stairs. I only ran a floor down when I bumped into a teacher.\n\n\"Hey, you're (my name) right? I'm pretty sure you're one of my students this year\", he said.\n\nI was still very panicky about what happened literally a minute earlier. The teacher looked into my eyes, his face changing expression. Looking now, he looked a bit familiar.\n\n\"Oh, I see. How many teachers have entered the classroom?\", he asked.\n\n\"Three\", I replied.\n\nHe inhaled and exhaled loudly, patted my shoulders and made me look into his eyes.\n\n\"Listen closely to what I'll say. Where we are now is the 5th floor, the last one. If you look behind you, the stairs where you came down from before you bumped me does not exist anymore. The floor you've been at was a mirror of the 5th floor. I don't want to scare you further, but you are very, very, very lucky to go out right before the 4th teacher enters. There were only a few of us who was able to escape before that happened\". \n\n\nI'm shocked at what the teacher said. I f*cking almost died right there. And the floor was not even supposed to exist? What the-\n\nHold up\n\nWhat does the teacher mean by us?\n\n\"You've probably seen my brother up there, right?\", the teacher asked.\n\n\"I don't think so, sir. The only adult there was the teac-\"\n\nI stopped speaking. I realized now why the teachee looked familiar. It was because my seatmate earlier looks like him, but younger. But a brother? Does he have a twin?\n\n\"Me and my brother enrolled in this school back then. We were supposed to be in the same classroom. Basically, we also arirved to school late and rushed to the room\".\n\nHe continued to describe the atmosphere he felt in the classroom. It was exactly what I felt back then.\n\n\"There were two chairs vacant at the back, so we both sat there. Three teachers came, called my name and not my brother's, and had a freakout afterwards. Everytime each classes ends, my brother was the one who helped me get back in my proper mind. It was the 4th teacher where...\"\n\nThe teacher sighed.\n\n\"Sir, you don't have to say it if you don't want to\", I said.\n\n\"He.... Saved me\", he said.\n\n\"He saved me too sir\", I replied. \n\nThe teacher patted my head as he seemed to be relieved.\n\n\"Don't worry, since we survived that one, we will never go back to there. And even if we did, I believe he will be there to protect us\", the teacher said.\n\nWe went to the classroom already and finally had a normal day afterwards. I went home feeling tired about what happened that day. I laid down on my bed, thinking about how the teacher's twin is still there in that dimension. It's really freaky to think about it. \n\nI closed my eyes to go to sleep when I remembered something. I went straight to my uniform in the laundry basket, fiddled through the pockets and grabbed something. It was the pen that the twin lent it to me. A thought passed by my head that was reflective and spooky at the same time.\n\nSo it really does exist.",

        "text": "I glanced down at the clock on my dashboard. 10:02, it read, in glowing green numbers amidst the darkness. Almost thirty minutes on the dot since we'd entered the town. \n\nIt was a nondescript little place. Short, squat gray and brown buildings with signs introducing local businesses lined the streets in the areas where small, but homey residential houses bunched close together amidst well-kept lawns were not. \n\nNothing too picturesque, but a standard Rust Belt town that although it had clearly seen better days, had kept on chugging until it was a passable, if not at times pleasant place to live. \n\nI knew the type well, my own home town in Central Illinois had been much the same. Beyond that, I was familiar with this very town, having passed through it on the way to the campsite my friends, Phil and Clay, and I had spent the weekend at. It reminded me of days past, the sort of place frozen in time.\n\nIt was that familiarity, perhaps, limited though it was that made the place stand out to me on the way to our campsite. The town marked the four hour point of our drive, and had been made something of a landmark as we’d determined to stop there for gas and some snacks on the way back.\n\nYet as we pulled off of the empty highway, the first thing that had begun to grip me was the *silence*.  \n\nFrom the moment we'd entered the town driving down what seemed to be the main road through the place, we had been greeted by nothing more than the staggering silence and a smell like that seemed to linger faintly.\n\nThere are few things that can truly, deeply unnerve a person. One of those things is true and utter silence. I’m not talking about the silence of a quiet home, with neighbors cars and distant yapping dogs audible from beyond your walls, no, true silence, especially in a place where there ought to be the opposite. \n\nThat was what we experienced rolling back through the town that had previously been as busy as any other along the highway. \n\nWith the exception of my vehicle, and that which carried my friends behind me, there was nothing. No distant roar of traffic on surrounding streets, the odd squeal of a break, honk of a horn, and call of a pedestrian.\n\nIt was more than just a lack of noise, however, there were no birds, or joggers, or people walking dogs, no cars in the road. \n\nI felt an uneasy twinge in my gut, like something plucking at a loose fabric, and found myself turning to my passenger seat to speak to my wife, an act of habit, before finding it empty. \n\n*Of course.* I recalled the feeling of reacquainting myself with reality, a bitter one. *She's not here, that's the whole reason you're on this trip.* \n\nThe camping trip had been Phil's idea following my divorce as a way to get me out of the funk they’d insisted I'd entered, and he and Clay had battered me with it until I reluctantly gave in. \n\nWe'd spent a week campground hopping around the state, and were making our way back towards our homes in the exurbs of Chicago. \n\nWe'd passed through the town on our way to one of the state parks much farther south, and it had stood out to me. It had been a relatively quiet place then, but still with plenty of folks out and about their business. \n\nIt seemed like the kind of town that still had a local hardware store not called Ace or Home Depot, and folks had Sunday breakfast at the local diner, and on our first pass through I felt myself oddly drawn to it in a nostalgic sort of way that made me think of better bygone days. I resolved it would be one of our pit stops on the way back upstate.\n\nThe plan had been to fill up at the gas station, and maybe stop for breakfast at the little local watering hole before continuing on our journey, and recharging our batteries in this Rockwell painting of a town. \n\nPart of me, the part seeking any logical explanation till the point of illogic, thought perhaps it was all an effect of the weather, both the impossibly sudden emptiness of the place and the sort of… surreal, almost dream-like disquiet that seemed to hang in the air everywhere. \n\nIt had been staggeringly sunny on our initial pass through, a rare sort of day in Illinois as the summer allowed an early peek through the spring, whereas now? It was overcast. \n\nAngry gray clouds hung overhead growing blacker and more foreboding by the minute, with them a feeling of static in the air, and a breeze carried through the empty streets - lone and errant and on it a chill of winter.  \n\nA larger part knew how ridiculous that thought was. I'd seen some bad weather in my day, even a few historic blizzards, and yet I'd never seen an entire town utterly empty. \n\nAnd yet, the last ten minutes had been spent driving slowly along the main road, my car in the lead as we retraced our previous steps through what seemed to be the main plaza of the quiet town.\n\nA sign painted on a dull green background, tucked within a floral display read “*Welcome to beautiful Criers Creek, Illinois! Population: 4,673*”\n\nAs far as I looked, I saw neither hide nor hair of a single one of those almost five-thousand people.\n\nLights remained shining through store fronts with no one to man them, the stop lights turned red, then green, then yellow all the same, though the road was deserted but for our two vehicles.\n\nCars remained in parking spots lining the streets, somehow feeling like old, ancient fossils, their presence made ominous in the terrible silence. \n\nA choice few rumbled feeling much like a pack of grumbling beasts in waiting as their engines ran idly. They made my gut tighten like a fist, a pool of anxiety forming of a steady drip at the back of my mind.\n\n*Riiiing*.\n\nThe sudden chime of my phone shattered the relative silence, making me jump in my seat. For the first time since entering the town, for the first time in a while, I was glad to be riding alone and no one could see my jumpiness.\n\n'Phil' the screen read, urging me to answer or deny the call. I did the former.\n\n“Hey,” I answered, eyes still squinted as I peered out the window. \n\nI still expected, or hoped might be a better word for it, to see someone. To catch some glimpse of motion passing behind a window, or catch a distant eye watching from a window as if this were all some trick the whole town was in on. \n\n“Hey,” Phil's voice was unusual, shakier, with a tinge of emotion not characteristic of him. I was reluctant to call it fear but…\n\n“Listen, either Clay and I are losing our fucking minds…”\n\nWe rounded a corner, onto a street leading to a roundabout centered around what was clearly the town park. A statue of some long dead figure, sat atop a horse with a sword drawn and face stern was the only facsimile of life visible.\n\n“Or there is literally *nobody* in this town but us..:”\n\nI felt the blood in my veins go cold at hearing the uneasy realization spoken aloud, as though the strange reality was made concrete in doing so. \n\n\"Yeah,\" I spoke reluctantly, \"It, uh, it looks like it.\"\n\n\"Guys, I'm not gonna lie bro,\" Clay's voice came over the line, and even through the phone I could hear the palpable disquiet heavy in his tone.\n\n\"I'm getting a fuckin *awful* feeling about this.\"\n\nAn icy chill rippled through me at that. He wasn’t wrong, of course. Since we’d entered the city limits, the air had felt almost charged with an uneasy, surreal sort of energy. It was the sort of feeling you get in a place that has just experienced great tragedy or upheaval. \n\nIf you’ve ever walked through the remains of a house burnt in a fire, or seen a town rendered unrecognizable by a heavy storm, you know the feeling. As though every inch was a warning of how *vulnerable* we all truly are, a stark reminder of our own fleeting nature.\n\nAnd yet, as we moved through those streets, taken by a silence that I could find no logical explanation for, with every bit of daunting unease I felt, there seemed a greater, nagging sort of curiosity. Something about it all bothered me, the suddenness of it. \n\nPlaces don’t just…up and desert like that. People don’t all just leave the homes, and jobs, and town they’ve known and loved, no, there felt like there was something more to it. And for some reason, I felt compelled to know what.\n\n‘*It feels like I only go backwards…*’\n\nI nearly leapt from my skin as the radio kicked to life, filling my car with the croon of a sudden unfamiliar voice. I squinted hard at the radio which had ceased working from the moment I had entered town, as though it might somehow explain the sudden interruption, which was over just as soon as it had started.\n\nOn the other end, I could hear a similar burst of sound, followed by Phil’s cursing in surprise.\n\n“This town is a god-damn dead zone for signals. Radio on the shitter, my data is cutting in and out. Where are we going, anyway man?”\n\n“There was a diner I saw when we passed through the first time. Cute little spot, reminded me of where Jenna and I first -” I swallowed the sudden knot in my throat, surprised by the emotion I felt at the memory.\n\n“It reminded me of a spot I used to eat at in college.”\n\nThere was silence from the other end, and I could all but see the looks passed between them at the mention of my ex wife, a mixture of concern and mild irritation.\n\n“Well, it doesn’t look like there’ll be much in the way of service…” Clay chimed in.\n\nOf course I knew he was correct, and yet in the moment, the idea of turning back somehow filled me with an unusual sort of apprehension. It was the feeling one has when forgetting some important meeting or gathering, aware only that it’s slipped their mind but not of what or how.\n\n“Probably, but I’d still like to check it out. C’mon boys,” I offered, trying my best to lighten the mood, “Where’s your sense of adventure.”\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Clay responded. \n\n“Okay, lead the way. See you then.” \n\nAnd so I did, navigating the stark emptiness of the streets with them in tow, only the faint whistle of the wind moving between the buildings, and the creak of wavering street lights, none of which seemed to follow any discernible sort of pattern, only working in seemingly random intervals.\n\nEvery so often the radio would spark to life, only to sputter off just as quickly. \n\nI tried to keep my eyes on the road. There was something about the lifelessness of the buildings that…seems to play to one's imagination. \n\nIf I let my eyes linger too long, I could swear there were figures, barely more than shadow and only there for a moment, darting behind curtains and walls.\n\nAfter a few minutes we arrived, pulling into a parking lot with a few dozen cars scattered throughout, as if from some morning breakfast rush we couldn’t see. \n\nAfter a moment to muster my confidence I stepped from the car, making my way across to the door. There was only the sound of my feet sliding across the pavement, and the rumble of the car behind me. A smell filled the air, like that of an old television set.\n\n*Ozone*, the word emerged like a thought whispered from somewhere.\n\nBehind me, Phil and Clay pulled into the lot quickly stepping from the car and following behind me, muttering to themselves. \n\nAs I arrived at the door, I felt confusion give way to apprehension, and a cold sweat began to bead above my brow. The doorway had been blocked, doors and chairs all piled in front in some makeshift excuse for a barricade. \n\nThe three of us paused for a moment as Clay and Phil caught up, a glance passing between us all that seemed to carry a different meaning in every eye, though all expressed an obvious disquiet.\n\nI knocked on the door, peering in through the dust-covered window for any sign of who might have piled all of the furniture, but found only an empty diner. Half-eaten meals, cellphones, and a lone laptop all sat around, the signs of life in motion yet with none of their owners to be found.\n\nI tried to stifle the chill I felt as the skeletal fingers of dread seemed to run along my spine gently. \n\n“Help me push this,” I implored, grunting as I positioned my shoulder against the door and began to push with great exertion. \n\nThe two looked at each other for a moment, before Phil gave a shrug, his eyes meeting Clay’s in a look that seemed to say “we might as well” before adding his effort to my own. \n\nThe door gave a hiss as we managed to pry it open almost half a foot, sending the chairs piled on the other side clattering to the ground in a cacophony that made my heart lurch, such a sudden change from the utter silence. \n\nI coughed, once then twice as my throat stung for a moment, that odd ozone smell seeming to grow stronger on the breeze. \n\n“You think this is a good idea?” Clay asked, still standing behind us. \n\nHis arms were crossed, and there was a look on his face that I didn’t like. It made me feel…analyzed. Like I was back in those marriage counseling sessions that had done fuck all, being mentally picked apart by my wife and therapist who it seemed both only existed to point out my every flaw.\n\nI bit back a retort, tasting the venom at the back of my throat and swallowing hard despite the irritation his attitude rising like floodwaters.\n\n“I think there’s a town full of people that just up and disappeared, and I think that’s something I can’t just drive away from.”\n\nI raised an eyebrow.\n\n“You’re a goddamn biology professor for the love of god, shouldn’t you have, like, some sort of *scientific curiosity* or something?”\n\nClay narrowed his eyes in a look of mild irritation, pursing his lips for a moment before muttering a few expletives and adding his strength to ours.\n\nThe door and the tables piled on the other end groaned in protest as we pushed it open as far as it would go.  \n\nOne by one we slipped through the opening and into the dinner. The fluorescent lights hummed and crackled, seeming to grow brighter as we entered, bathing the sky blue wallpaper and vomit green tiles on the floor in a hospital-esque glow. \n\nIt somehow made the situation feel all the more surreal and unwelcoming, pairing with the silence to turn what otherwise seemed your common small town diner into an utterly unfamiliar and *alien* place. \n\nOutside, the wind seemed to pick-up on the surreality that seemed to fill the air, and made the windows groan in protest against it.\n\nClay made his way towards the counter, ringing the lone bell several times.\n\n“Enough man, christ,” Phil chided, “There’s nobody here.”\n\nClay shrugged, before climbing onto the counter. \n\n“What are you doing?” I demanded, as Clay slid over the counter still bearing half-finished coffee’s and meals, and onto the other side.\n\n“Making a damn coffee.” he grunted, grabbing an untouched sausage from one of the plates and taking a bite. \n\nI felt the need to argue, but after a moment could think of no reason why. The place was abandoned, it wasn’t like anyone was coming.\n\nAnd yet…I couldn’t help but feel a need to be silent, as though any overwhelming noise might attract the attention of… well that didn’t feel quite as clear. \n\n“Coffee boys? Anyone?” Clay asked, waving his cup at us and spilling a bit on the linoleum.\n\nPhil nodded, and Clay made his way back to the machine. I muttered a ‘no thanks’ continuing around the diner. A laptop, a few tables away, caught my attention. It was open, the screen still glowing though it was dim. \n\nI made my way closer, eyeing it suspiciously. Beside it sat a set of keys and a wallet. I couldn’t help but feel a chill at the sight, all things no one would leave behind unless left without a choice.\n\n*We shouldn’t be here.* The thought forced itself through my head, and I tried to dismiss it, curiosity still burning. \n\nAnd still, I found myself sliding into the booth in front of the laptop, celebrating silently that it was still open.\n\nOn the screen I immediately recognized the Facebook messenger, having had to answer plenty of ‘hey, we’re here if you need anything’ messages from folks I hadn’t heard from in years after my divorce. \n\nI felt a twinge of unease as I realized I was reading someone’s messages. This was certainly already an invasion of privacy to be sure, and now it felt even moreso. Still, I continued, pushed on by an almost feverish need to understand what was happening.\n\nAs I began to read, I felt icicles forming along the walls of my veins, my blood turning to icy slush, my insides to liquid. The account belonged to a Dan Almond, a slightly older gentleman in his mid-fifties, and the messages were between him and another man, Kevin,  who was clearly his son. Earlier ones made it clear the kid was away at college.\n\n‘*I love you kiddo, your mom loves you, we all love you so much, and I’m so proud of you*.’ The first message sent that day read. \n\n‘*There’s something going on here in town. I can’t explain it, it don’t seem anyone can, but I don’t think your momma and I are gonna be there for graduation bud. I’m sorry*.’\n\n‘*Just don’t come home. Don’t come back to Crier’s Creek, ain’t nothing good here for you anymore.’*\n\n‘*Dad, are you okay? What the hell is going on, I’ve been getting texts and seeing things on snapchat all day about something flying over the town? Is mom okay?*’\n\n‘*She’s with me kiddo. We’re together. I can’t tell you what’s going on, don’t even know myself, I just know we can’t go outside.*\n\n*People are disappearing. Pulled straight up into the sky like the rapture, but I don’t think this has nothing to do with God. Saw Mr. O’Reilly yanked straight off the ground, heard him scream until it stopped all of a sudden.*’\n\nHis son's responses came soon after, frantic and questioning, followed by a call that wasn’t answered.\n\n‘*Dad, pick up. Who’s Mr. O’Reilly?*’\n\n‘*Dad, please pick up the phone!*’\n\n‘*I’m sorry, you got no idea how much I’d like to hear your voice right now but we have to be quiet. I’m at the Larry’s with your mom, the folks here have got the doors all barricaded up. Can’t help but think it won’t do much good though.’*\n\nI felt a cold creeping up along my spine, a cold awful dread sewing itself deep into the fields of my mind. \n\n*‘I can hear it now, over us. Damn thing sounds like a truck. I love you kiddo. Never forget it.*’\n\nIt was the final text sent from Dan. There were a few more from his son, desperate and pleading for a response, followed by a string of calls that went unanswered and then…nothing.\n\nI took a breath, feeling an uneasy tremor developing. The sounds of clinking plates and glasses as Clay and Phil cooked themselves breakfast seemed to fade to the background as I found myself reading the conversation again and again, any doubts that I had had as to whether or not something awful had happened here  faded rapidly.\n\nI still can’t be certain what drove me to make the call. Perhaps it was the unease, and the hope that somehow the young man would be able to offer some rational explanation, perhaps even explaining how his father had been mistaken and the town had been evacuated due to a gas leak or some similarly mundane reason.\n\nIt may not bode well for us, but the longer I sat there the less I felt anything would, and at least that response might quell the rising dread I was feeling. It was like being a child again, a fear of something nebulous and formless yet dreadfully present all the same.\n\nThe chime of the call ringing filled the diner, drawing both other sets of eyes towards me, both asking the same silent questions.\n\nAfter a moment, there was finally an answer.\n\n“Hello?” The voice belonged to a man, who couldn't have been older than twenty-something.\n\n“Hi, is this Kevin?”\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n“Yeah. Who is this?” \n\nI felt a twinge of unease at the tone of his response, questioning, but not nearly as…worried as I’d expect someone to sound receiving a call from a stranger on their apparently missing fathers Facebook.\n\n“I - uh, I’m a friend of Dan’s..” I lied, hoping that it hadn’t sounded quite as obvious as it felt. \n\nThere was another silence, longer than before, and in it I could swear the tension was palpable, it was as if I could hear the gears turning in his head.\n\n“I  don’t know any Dan’s. Sorry man, wrong guy.”\n\nMy heart struck hard against the inside of my chest, as I tried to swallow the unyielding knot of dread that had formed in my throat somewhere along the way.\n\nPhil’s questioning look grew worried, surely seeing the fear on my face, Clay’s irritated and uneasy as he mouthed a ‘what?’ in my direction, clearly wanting to be caught up. Feeling the creep of anxiety as it began to brim over, and unsure of what else to say I elected for the uneasy truth.\n\n“Y - your father. Your father Dan, I - I found his laptop in a diner in a town called Criers Creek. I think something may have happened to him I -”\n\n“Listen man, I told you you’ve got the wrong guy. I - I never knew either of my parents. Got no memory of em.” \n\nThere was some palpable emotion at the end of his words that I could tell he was trying to restrain and yet...it felt as though he was telling the truth, or at least the truth as he believed it despite the evidence the previous messages laid out. It made my skin crawl and stomach tighten like a fist, an inhuman dread gripping me firmly in its clutches.\n\nThe wind outside grew heavy, and the windows all seemed to yawn and groan in simultaneous protest, the sounds forming a frightful symphony. I peered outside one of the windows that stretched along the walls on either side, and could see nothing in the empty streets and even less in the skies above. \n\nThe clouds all seemed to threaten of an approaching storm, the sort that transformed streets into rivers and fields into swamp, a force capable of changing the face of the earth beneath it. And yet, not a rain drop was to be seen. \n\nJust clouds, clouds behind which, if I looked for too long, I thought I could see shapes moving within, large and darker even than the surrounding gray, but gone as soon as I’d thought they’d appeared. \n\nI searched for something - anything to say that would lead to a rational answer. It had always been in my nature, let my ex wife tell it, a need to be right that made confusion feel all but unacceptable. I’ve never seen how it could be a negative, the pursuit of knowledge. Now I wonder if perhaps, I simply refused to.\n\n*He doesn’t remember his father.* The thought rang like a question to which I could find no answer.\n\n“I’m sorry, but I’m gonna have to ask you not to contact me again please. Good luck with…whatever.”\n\n“Wait, please I -”\n\nThe laptop chimed with a cheer I didn’t feel, as the call ended. I tried again, but there was no answer, and before I could go for a third, the account had been blocked.\n\n“What the fuck was that about?” Clay asked, his unease apparent, eyes darting between myself and Phil who didn’t look any better himself.\n\nI could think of nothing else to do but tell them the truth. When I was through, there was silence for a moment, that seemed to linger for hours between the three of us. \n\n“We need to go.” Phil finally chimed. \n\n“If any of that is true, then we need to get the fuck out of this place, *now*.”\n\nClay nodded, sliding his plate away and making his way over the counter and towards the door.\n\nTo my own surprise I felt a bloom of apprehension, feeling an argument building inside of me. They were right, obviously. Something was going on that I could make no sense of, and yet…still, I wanted to understand. People don’t just disappear, none of this was possible, and for reasons that still escape me I felt driven to prove it.\n\nYet the look on their faces, it made me uneasy. It was the face you’d expect from the crew of a ship far too long at sea, to the captain who’d denied them a return home. The entire trip had been for me, and though I may not have called for it, it was certainly my decision to visit this town, and my choices that had kept us there. \n\nSomething told me that disagreement might not be an option at this point. I stood and slid from the booth, casting one last glance at the laptop before nodding my agreement. \n\nClay gave a brief nod, and had turned to open the door when -\n\n*BOOM*\n\nThere was a sound like a train derailing, or a bomb going off or both, somewhere closeby, that sent all three of us scattering along the ground. The windows shook, and the air itself seemed to vibrate with a sound like nothing I’d ever heard, a strange, all-present sort of hum that seemed to come from everywhere.\n\nMy eyes darted wildly about the room in my utter panic, searching for the cause, and I could swear I caught a glimpse of something outside. It was quick, and massive, moving about the sky as if unaffected by gravity, but as that awful hum grew I shut my eyes tight, trying to will away the ache in my skull\n\nThat smell from earlier, like burning ozone, grew thick until everyone was coughing uncontrollably. My head spun, and my vision shook. \n\n*KRA - BOOM*\n\nAnother explosive sound rocked the air, shattering several of the windows. As quickly as it began, everything ended, the world going eerily still.",

But I was wrong. They came back, stronger than ever before.\n\nI first noticed their presence when I was walking down the street, on my way back from a therapy session. It was a bright, sunny day, but suddenly everything went dark. The shadows were everywhere, creeping up on me from every direction.\n\nI tried to run, but my legs wouldn't move. I was frozen in place, trapped in the darkness. And then I heard the whispers, the same whispers that had haunted me for years.\n\n\"Come back to us,\" they said. \"Join us in the darkness,\" they said.\n\nI tried to resist, but the shadows were too strong. They pulled me down, dragging me by the heels into a world of darkness and terror. \n\nFor weeks, I was trapped in that place, a place where the shadows ruled and I was their prisoner. I could hear them whispering to me, calling out to me in the dead of night. They wanted me to do things, terrible things, and I was powerless to resist.\n\nAnd then, one night, something changed. I woke up to find that the shadows had taken physical form, creeping up from the floor like tendrils of smoke. They surrounded me, trapping me in their grasp.\n\nI tried to fight back, but it was useless. The shadows were too strong, too powerful. And then, in the darkness, I saw something that chilled me to the bone.\n\nThe shadows were taking on the shape of a person, a person with glowing eyes and a twisted smile. It was like something out of a nightmare, and I knew that I was doomed.\n\nThe figure stepped forward, its hand outstretched. And then it spoke, in a voice that was not human. Not English, but a language that was foreign, something demonic.\n\n\"Welcome to the darkness,\" it said. I could understand it. Better than English. \n\nI don't know what that thing was, what *it* was. It saved me before, but that feeling I can't shake it. This time was different it felt evil, hungry for blood, hungry for *me*.\n\nAs the figure stepped closer, its twisted smile grew wider and more menacing. Its eyes seemed to glow brighter, and its presence filled the room with a sickening aura of evil.\n\nI tried to back away, but the tendrils of shadow were tight around my body, holding me in place. I felt a cold, clammy hand grip my shoulder, and I knew that I was trapped.\n\nThe figure leaned in closer, its breath hot against my face. I could smell the stench of death on its breath, and I felt a wave of nausea wash over me.\n\n\"I've been waiting for you,\" it hissed, its voice echoing around the room. \"You're mine now.\"\n\nI struggled to break free from the shadows, but they only tightened their grip. The figure laughed, a sound that was like nails on a chalkboard, and raised its hand.\n\nIn its hand was a wicked-looking blade, black as pitch and sharp as a razor. I knew what it was going to do, and I closed my eyes, bracing myself for the pain.\n\nBut it never came. Instead, I felt a sudden gust of wind, and when I opened my eyes again, the figure was gone. The shadows had retreated, and I was alone in the room.\n\nI stumbled to my feet, my heart racing. What had just happened? Was it all a hallucination, a product of my troubled mind? Or was something truly evil lurking in the darkness?\n\nI didn't know, but one thing was clear. The shadows were still there, waiting for me to let my guard down. And the figure, whatever it was, was still out there, watching and waiting\n\nFor months after the incident, I tried to live my life as normally as possible. I went to work, spent time with my friends, and tried my best to forget about the shadows and the figure that had haunted me for so long.\n\nBut no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't escape the feeling that I was being watched. Everywhere I went, I felt a cold presence at my back, like someone was following me.\n\nI tried to ignore it, to tell myself that it was just my imagination, but deep down I knew that it was something more. Something evil and unrelenting, something that would never let me go.\n\nOne night, as I was getting ready for bed, I caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of my eye. When I turned to look, there was nothing there, just the shadows dancing on the wall.\n\nBut then I heard a sound, a low, guttural growl that seemed to come from every direction at once. It was the same sound I had heard from the figure that night, and I knew that it was still out there, watching from every corner.\n\nI tried to leave the room, to get away from the sound, but the shadows seemed to be closing in on me, creeping up from the floor and the walls. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the growling stopped.\n\nI was alone again, but I knew that I was never truly alone. The figure was always there, lurking in the darkness, waiting for the right moment to strike.\n\nFrom that day on, I couldn't sleep. Every night, I lay awake, listening to the sound of my own breathing and the beating of my heart, waiting for the shadows to come back.\n\nAnd they always did. Every night, without fail, they would creep up on me, surrounding me with their cold embrace. And then the figure would appear, its eyes glowing in the darkness, its voice echoing in my mind.\n\n\"Welcome back,\" it would say. \"I've been waiting for you.\"\n\nI tried to fight back, to push the shadows away and banish the figure from my mind, but it was no use. The more I resisted, the stronger they became, until I was completely consumed by their darkness.\n\nI knew then that I was never going to win this battle. The figure and the shadows were too powerful, too relentless, and they would never stop until they had claimed me for their own.\n\nAnd so I gave up. I surrendered to the darkness, to the shadows and the figure that haunted me. I knew that I was doomed, but I was too tired to fight anymore.\n\nNow, as I sit here in the darkness, listening to the whispers of the shadows and the growling of the figure, I know that there is no escape. I am trapped here, in this world of darkness.\n\nthe figure always wins. He always has a plan for me, and for you.",

        "text": "To whom it may concern,\n\nI beseech thee, help me return to my world. I'm writing this glass tablet my captor left unattended by my cage. I've seen him use it to send invisible letters, or so I've gathered, and hopefully whatever magic he uses will work for me as well.\n\nI'm in a domicile in a place called \"Two-Sun\" The walls appear to be made out of some sort of cracked paper-like material. The odd thing is that the house is seemingly able to move at the will of the owner. Hopefully this narrows things down enough for you to locate me.\n\nI should introduce myself. I am an autumnal pixie of the Seelie Court by the name of Leafblossom. I am an intrepid explorer and cartographer by trade. I entered this realm through the ancient art of tree-hopping: using the magical properties of various trees to transport between dimensions. However, when I got to this realm, I found my magical powers waning rapidly. It's my hypothesis that large amounts of cold-forged iron, or some other magic-sapping metal, have permeated the air around your hives, or perhaps just this hive in particular. I was unable to locate a return tree before I was captured. He was riding this iron four-legged spider-horse, and drinking mead out of an immaculate glass bottle wrapped in brown paper. He was upon me before I could react, and I haven't been able to escape his clutches since.\n\nMy captor appears to be some form of local magistrate or lord. The less said about him and his cohorts the better. Their corrousing is... obscene and shameful. If someone could rescue me from him, and bring me to the nearest \"american chestnut\" tree, I would be eternally indebted to you. I know the whole of your race can’t be like this. There must be humans with compassion and mercy. I’ve been to many dimensions, and every species that forms society has had such virtues. I know that despite your outwardly frighting and gigantic appearance, you have the same capacity for goodness as us pixies. I have to believe it, because the idea that I am trapped in a land of monsters who could swallow me whole is too horrifying to contemplate.\n\nI must make haste. He returns soon. Please, I beg of you, find pity in your heart. I... I need this to stop. He hasn't let me out of this cage in a season or longer. I don't know when he'll leave this tablet in arm's reach next. I will grant any boon or do any service in my power for anyone who helps me, I swear on my true name. Please, just have pity.\n\nI must go. Thank you to anyone who reads this. There's a possibility I may gain access again in the future, so reply letters would be appreciated, if for no other reason than to keep my spirits up. If anyone could help explain the strange ways of you humans, I would appreciate it greatly. Despite my circumstances, I am still interested in this dimension.\n\nSafe travels,\n\nLeafblossom",

        "text": "(My first story, for anyone unfamiliar: [https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sfy1fu/fataville/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/sfy1fu/fataville/))\n\nHello, all!\n\nApologies for how long it’s been since I continued. I began to type up my other story that I felt you all would find interesting, but, to be honest – the situation around my friend Ondine is still something I find somewhat hard to think about. It’s a story I want to tell, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy.\n\nSo, in the meantime, I reached out, trying to find some people from my hometown willing to discuss their experiences.  \n\nI had a little more luck this time! No one who currently lives in town was willing to talk to me, but I found a software developer who’d moved out of state who was willing to share an experience they had, on the condition no names appeared in it. You have to be careful about these things.\n\nI’m trying to finish the story of Ondine and thinking about going back to see if I can interview anyone. I can’t give a date, but take this in the meantime.\n\nCopied verbatim from one “Annaliese”, aside from name changes to protect privacy:\n\nSo, this happened when I was in my twenties, right?  \n\nI *know,* I know the rule about sunset. Everyone knows the rule about sunset. But you know as well as I do that people stretch rules all the time. I knew you weren’t supposed to be outside after dark, but I thought – my porch doesn’t really count as *outside* right? It’s got a screen and everything. I thought it would be okay. And I guess it sort of was? In the end, anyway.  \n\nLet me explain.  \n\nI didn’t have any work to do, so I was curled up on my porch with a little merlot, breathing in the evening air. No one was on the streets, already – the few people I saw, I saw getting out of cars, brushing away salt as they entered their homes. It was quiet, a good night to sit and rest. You know in the evening when the air’s cool like a glass of water, and you can just sit and relax and be washed clean of the day’s cares?\n\nIt was a good night. Can you really blame me for not wanting to go inside yet? I mean. I know it was dumb. But I really thought it would be okay. I didn’t think Anyone would notice me, and I thought I could just go inside if They did. I was so close to my door.  \n\nWhat happened?\n\nWell, I think I must have drifted off for a moment. The air was cool, and my chair was soft, and I just don’t know. I must have drifted off, right? I remember it like...like I fast-forwarded in a video. You know, you press the button and everything’s hazy for a moment, and then the whole scene changed. It was like that. I was just sitting there, sipping my drink, and then I looked around and it was night.\n\nDo you remember the nights there? I saw a video once, from a sailor, of what night looks like in the middle of the sea. Blackness pressing down on you like a wall. Like being swallowed.  \n\nIt was never that dark in Fataville, but it felt like that. Do you remember?\n\nWell, when I saw it was dark, I did feel afraid then. I remember suddenly feeling like my little porch was a raft on a churning ocean. A tiny island of sanctuary in a place that didn’t belong to me.  \n\nI stood – a little unsteadily, from the merlot – and I was going to go inside and turn on the TV or something. What had looked like a good idea when the sun was up had a different face now. I was going to go back inside. My hand was at the door when I heard the footsteps.\n\nI shouldn’t have looked. It’s rude to look, and it’s not safe to be rude. But I looked.  \n\nI saw a procession, moving slowly down the road. I couldn’t have counted how many there were – if it was the wine or something else, they seemed to swim in front of my eyes. There was twenty at the very least, although I couldn’t be sure of that – I thought I saw the gleam of bodyless eyes, their owners obscured by shadow too deep for the surrounding night. The details of the figures were hard to make out.  \n\nI don’t know if what I remember will be of any use to your story. But I’ll try.\n\nThere was a woman, I think. All crowned in flowers – my friend Adelaide, they know *everything* about flowers, all the names and things. I don’t know these names, but I remember how bright they were. It was weird – it was like she was lit by sunlight, even in the middle of the night. Her flowers were *so* bright.\n\nI remember another woman too, I think. Her dress was white and her hair was *long –* past her thighs, trailing on the ground. I remember her because I could see everything about her but her eyes. I think that they must have been covered by her hair.  \n\nI don’t like to think she didn’t have any.\n\nI thought I saw many things. But what I know that I saw was a coffin.\n\nThey were bearing it on their shoulders, their faces set and solemn. I realized, then, that many of the strange pallbearers had faces streaked with tears. Many were crying quietly, in that awful way people have when they know nothing can be done. I remember looking at them and feeling tears down my face. It’s silly to say it now, but you weren’t there – they were just so *sad.* I remember when my mom died, and I just felt *crushed,* you know? People say that a lot, but that’s really what it felt like. That sort of awful place after the first shock, where the loss is setting in, and it’s like the sun will never rise again. Like it will be night forever, and you’ll always be in a world that doesn’t belong to you anymore.\n\nThat’s what I felt, looking at them. Like a car wreck, I couldn’t look away\n\nAnd then – this part is a little hard to explain. I know it was stupid, okay? It just felt right. Like something that needed to be done.\n\nI was staring at the procession and I saw something. They’d almost passed my house, and it’s the strangest thing to say now, but it felt like there was a space in the procession. There was something missing. Someone was supposed to be here, and wasn’t, and now everything was wrong.\n\nI had to do something. I had to. I can’t justify it now, but I had to.  \n\nI started to sing. I say *I,* because it was my voice, but not the tune nor the words didn’t belong to me. I’d never sung like that before, like a crack of lightning, like a wail. I can’t remember the words now, sorry – I just seemed to know them. They needed to be sang and so I knew them long enough to sing. They were heavy words, deep and dark. They ached in my throat like a mouthful of seawater.  \n\nAnd the procession stopped.\n\nAs one, they turned to stare at me, every head moving in unison. I wanted to run, somewhere in me, but I couldn’t. I had a duty I had to fulfill.  \n\nA man left the procession and approached me. He was tall – so tall I didn’t think he could have fit into my porch. Everything about him was stretched – his hat was terribly long, and his fingers had double the joints of mine.  \n\nHe spoke to me. It’s strange – I remember what he said, but I can’t remember his voice at all.  \n\n“You come at a welcome time, friend!” he said, and a sort of shivery shock ran through me. “We lacked a keener, and so our ceremony was incomplete. You are most welcome,” he said, and smiled at me with too many teeth. “Come! Now we can lay our friend to rest with honors.”\n\nDid I go with him?\n\nOf course I went with him.\n\nHow could I not go with him?\n\nI can’t tell you everything that happened – I’m sorry, I know you have a lot of curious fans on the internet, but it’s not mine to tell, right? It was a personal, private moment that I was only permitted to intrude on for a night. It’d be rude, and you know how They feel about being rude.  \n\nSuffice it to say, I did come home. My girlfriend found me on the porch, fast asleep. I had a crown of flowers upon my head, and alcohol on my breath. My face was red with weeping, she said, but despite that I had a faint smile upon my lips.  \n\nI had been missing, according to her, for three days.\n\nDid anything else happen?\n\nWell. Suffice it to say I was paid for services rendered, and leave it at that.\n\n*Fin.*\n\nI thought you'd all be interested - I certainly was, for how markedly different this was to my own strange experience. It's probably folly on my part, but I find I want to know the secrets of my hometown more and more. There is so much there that hides behind the *rules.* I'm retired now - it'll be dangerous, but I can't help wanting to pry further.\n\n Annaliese refused to explain what she meant by payment, but I have a theory – that I formed by checking her LinkedIn, if you can believe it. She’s listed as a software developer, but when I looked at her education history, it said, *Otherwhere College.*\n\nNow what do you all think about that?",

        "text": "Every time I close my eyes, I’m transported back to that fateful summer. The events that unfolded seemed like a never-ending nightmare, and the scars they left behind are still raw. But I’ve made it back home, and after much reflection and contemplation, I know that the story needs to be told. Maybe it’s a way for me to come to terms with what happened, or perhaps it’s to warn others of the horrors that can lurk in the shadows—and sometimes even in the light of day.  Whatever the reason, I’m ready to share it now.\n\n\\*\\*\\*  \nWe were driving on Route 1, the sun shining down on us as we made our way toward Richmond, Virginia for our honeymoon. Shanice was behind the wheel, her hand intertwined with mine, and I couldn’t help but smile at how lucky I was to have her as my wife. It had been a long trip, and we were both tired from the wedding. We couldn’t wait to check in at the hotel and finally start our life together. It had been a long journey to get to this point in our lives, as we had faced many challenges and obstacles along the way, but we had always stuck together, supporting each other through thick and thin. Shanice looked at me, exhausted but still as beautiful as ever.\n\n*Here Comes The Sun* by The Beatles played on the radio and as the sun continued to shine down on us, we sang along to the lyrics, feeling grateful for the love and joy that surrounded us. The scenery passing by was breathtaking and I took it all in, realizing how truly blessed we were to have each other and this moment. As we neared our destination, excitement built up inside us. We looked forward to the adventures and memories we were about to create. I had never felt more at peace. Then something interrupted that peace.\n\nA bang came from the sky, like thunder but sharper. It was so powerful that Shanice almost lost control of the vehicle. For a moment, I felt nauseous, and then the song on the radio glitched out and was replaced by a harsh male voice.\n\n“According to eyewitnesses, a large submarine was seen cruising along the coastline of Havana earlier this morning. The witnesses claim that the submarine appeared to be of Japanese origin, and was flying the flag of the Rising Sun. The sighting has not been confirmed by authorities, but the reports are being taken very seriously…”\n\nThere was a whistling sound piercing through the air, growing louder and more intense by the second, and maybe a mile ahead of us, we saw a bright, glowing object streaking toward the ground.\n\n“My God,” said Shanice as she slowed down, “what is that?”\n\nThe song on the radio came back intermittently but kept glitching out.\n\n“It must be a meteorite,” I said, my voice filled with excitement and awe. “That’s incred—”\n\nThere was a loud boom to our right, and the car shook as a part of the meteorite must have hit the ground, creating a massive explosion. I could feel the heat of the impact even from where we were.\n\n“Wow,” whispered Shanice, her eyes wide with shock. “That was something else!” She pulled over. Some dirt landed on the hood of the car. “Do we call someone?”\n\n“I-I don’t know.” I looked at the smoke rising from the crater. “Where did the bigger one go? It should’ve hit the ground by now.” But it hadn’t. It was as if it had disappeared altogether. “Let’s get out and check out the crater”, I said with some excitement now that my shock has subsided.\n\n“Wait.” Shanice put her hand on my shoulder. “What’s up with the radio?”\n\nI hadn’t paid any attention to it. It was still broadcasting the other channel, but there was a woman talking now.\n\n“…is well aware of the potential implications of a conflict between the British Empire and the Empire of Japan, and they are taking all necessary measures to prevent it from escalating.”\n\n“What about it,” I said. “Let’s get out and—”\n\n“Just wait, would you? They said something strange just now, didn’t you hear it? Something about—” She looked worried. “Just listen for a second, okay?”\n\nAn elderly man was talking now. It sounded like a recording of a speech.\n\n“…Confederate States of America will continue to work with our allies to ensure peace and stability in the world. We believe that diplomacy and dialogue are the best means to resolve disputes and maintain stability in the international community.”\n\nI felt nauseous again. The column of smoke coming from the crater next to the road appeared almost sickening now, although I couldn’t tell exactly why.\n\n“It’s—” I swallowed nervously. “It’s just some radio show, honey.”\n\nShe changed the channel.\n\n“Well, Bob, the Return to Africa bill was definitely a step in the right direction when it came to giving African slaves their freedom after the so-called ‘Great Slave Surplus’ in the sixties when modern farming equipment replaced, I would say most slaves working on the fields. However, it also had the unintended consequence of creating a shortage in the construction industry that’s still felt today. A lot of people are arguing that it’s time to end the practice of slavery on a national level, pointing to the success of the British, and even the Japanese, who both abolished slavery long ago. They also say the practice makes our people look indolent—some even go as far as to use the word *lazy*—in the eyes of the international community. What do you think about that, Mary? Are the American people ready to give up—”\n\n“What the hell?” I said. “That’s another channel?”\n\n“What’s going on, James?” Shanice looked at me, her eyes filled with fear.\n\n“It’s just a coincidence,” I said as I picked up my phone. “Try another channel, you’ll see. I’ll call 911 and alert the authorities about— Actually, I don’t have a signal… Do you—”\n\nShe was already looking at her phone.\n\n“No, me neither.”\n\nWith a trembling hand, she tuned the radio to another channel yet again. A strange, opera-like song was just fading out and was replaced by the voice of a cheerful man:\n\n“Are you looking for a reliable and hardworking servant? Look no further than South Shore Trading Company! Our servants are the best in the business. They do the hard work for you, so you can relax and enjoy your time. We have a wide selection of servants to fit your needs, from cooking and cleaning to gardening and childcare. Get the help you need with our top-notch servants. Visit South Shore Trading Company today and get the perfect servant for your family!”\n\nShanice turned the radio off and stepped out of the car. I followed her. She was trying to light a cigarette.\n\n“Let’s drive to the nearest town and report the meteor impact from there,” I suggested. “And whatever is going on with the radio, I don’t know, it must be some kind of collaboration between the stations to spread awareness. We must have just missed the context, that’s all. I mean, what else could it be?”\n\n“Something isn’t right,” Shanice said. “I’m feeling off, like something is just wrong. That thing, that thing from the sky, it— Don’t you feel it?”\n\nI did feel it—a feeling of impending doom—but I didn’t want to admit it to myself, and since it didn’t seem to make sense, I didn’t want to worry my wife further by mentioning it.\n\n“All good reasons to get out of here,” I said.\n\nWe got back into the car. Shanice took the passenger seat, too upset to drive, and let me take the wheel. I took one last look at the column of smoke. A part of me still wanted to check out the crater, to see what was hiding in it, but by now it was nothing more than morbid curiosity. All excitement was gone. I put the pedal to the metal. The dust from the impact blew off the windscreen as I made sure we got out of there as fast as possible.\n\nAfter driving for some time, without turning on the radio, the dread that had settled in me didn’t go away as I would’ve hoped but rather increased. Something was off, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it was. Shanice, constantly checking her phone to see if the signal was back, didn’t say much but I could tell she was feeling the same.\n\nAn odd-looking truck drove past us in the opposing lane. It had a strangely prolonged hood and the trailer attached to it was reminiscent of a classic wagon albeit made of black metal. The body of the truck was a weathered brown and the large black wheels and rugged tires added to its unusual appearance. Just before it passed, I noticed the driver—an elderly black man wearing a gray corporate overall—looking down at us with a facial expression of disbelief.\n\n“What the hell kind of truck was that?” I said. “Did you see that?”\n\n“Maybe we should go back?” Shanice bit her nails, as she always did when nervous or stressed. “I’m telling you, something absolutely crazy is going on. It’s not just the meteor, the radio, or the truck it’s *everything*. I know it sounds silly, honey, but I don’t think we should continue down this road.”\n\nI drove to the side of the road and stopped the car.\n\n“I’m freaked out too,” I said, “but what could possibly be going on? We could’ve been killed by that meteor and we’re both still in shock, I think. Now, we can go back, for sure, but this is supposed to be our honeymoon, and do we really want whatever this is to ruin that? We should be in Ashland soon. Maybe we should at least go there and—”\n\nA harsh siren, reminiscent of a fire alarm, came from behind us. I looked in the rearview mirror. A police car—similar to the strange truck but smaller and more aerodynamic—had pulled up behind us. Two officers wearing leather jackets, black boots, and Stetson hats stepped out of the vehicle as soon as they had turned off the dreadful sirens. Shanice was shaking next to me, anticipating something I couldn’t even imagine. I locked the doors to the car and put my hand on the car key, getting ready to get out of there. As they walked up to our car, I saw in the rear-view mirror that they were both wearing the Confederate flag on their sleeves.\n\n“Those aren’t real cops!” Shanice yelled, probably after noticing the same thing. “Just drive!”\n\nI turned the key and the engine roared to life. I stepped on the gas pedal and the car lurched forward. The officers quickly jumped back into their own car and began to pursue us.\n\nI made a U-turn and began driving back toward Washington. The police car—or whatever it was—remained close behind us, its flashing lights filling the car with an eerie red glow. Shanice was crying and yelling at me to go faster. I drove as fast as I could, but the police car remained at our heels. I couldn’t believe—nor understand—what was happening, all I knew was that we had to get away from those men and get in touch with the *real* police. Up ahead, where the meteor had hit the ground, I noticed that a roadblock had been set up, blocking our escape. I swerved onto a dirt road, hoping to lose our pursuers, but their vehicle was too nimble and followed us. Eventually, we came to a small town. Here, I thought, the madness had to come to an end. We just needed to find some normal, decent people and get in touch with the authorities.\n\n“Oh, my God”, Shanice said, “it’s everywhere!”\n\nIn front of us, outside what looked like a town hall building, was a flagpole flying the Confederate flag. I pushed the car to its limits, swerving around corners and accelerating down straightaways. The people on the sidewalks looked at us in astonishment. The clothes they wore were a strange, eerie mix of bygone eras, as if they’d stepped straight out of another time. The women were draped in long, flowing dresses that were reminiscent of the 1940s, with their hair styled in soft waves and their lips painted a deep red. But there were also touches of a more archaic style, with corsets peeking out and parasols clutched in their gloved hands. The men, too, were dressed in a way that was both familiar and foreign. They wore suits with wide lapels and suspenders, but the trousers were cut higher, almost to the knee, and the shoes were shiny and black, with large buckles. The overall effect was unsettling, as if they had somehow stepped out of a dream and into the modern world, still dressed in the garb of a long-gone time.\n\nThe road ahead split in two directions. I had to make a quick decision. I swerved to the left and took a sharp turn, only to face down another one of those strange police cars. I stepped on the brakes and was just about to back up when the other car showed up behind us.\n\n“Fuck!” I yelled.\n\n“What do we do?” Shanice asked. “James?”\n\nThe officers stepped out of their cars and surrounded us, all of them with their hands on their holsters. One of them, a tall man with a narrow face, knocked on the window next to me with his baton. Reluctantly, I rolled down the window, feeling my heart in my throat, and grabbed Shanice's hand.\n\n“Step out of the vehicle, both of you”, said the man. “You are under arrest.”\n\n“I don’t understand,” I said. “What’s up with that flag, with—”\n\nAnother officer—a short man of heavy build—appeared next to the tall man.\n\n“Toyota”, he said with a southern drawl. “Sounds Japanese.”\n\n“The flag?” said the tall man. “Which flag? You are arrested for evasion of the law and reckless endangerment. Now are you going to step out of the car, or do we need to pull you out?”\n\n“This is insane”, I whispered under my breath. “Look, I don’t know what twisted, racist re-enactment, role-playing game, or sheer fantasy you’re trying to live out but last time I checked this was still The United States of America, and what you’re doing to us is illegal.”\n\nThe officers laughed.\n\n“We’re not in the US anymore,” Shanice said. “James, don’t you get it?”\n\n“Wha-what?” I said, confused. “This is ridiculous.”\n\n“So let me get this straight,” the officer said with a smirk. “You’re driving around in a strange, Japanese vehicle, dressed like I don’t know what, and are pretending to be from The United States of America and you’re suggesting that it is *us* that lives in a fantasy world? You need to step out of the car and come with us to the station. It’s either that or the hard way which none of us want.”\n\n“This isn’t our world,” Shanice whispered. “Something happened when that meteor hit, something impossible. I just know it. I felt it instantly.”\n\n“O-okay… but what do we do? I’m terrified.”\n\n“We have to play along, that’s all we can do now—”\n\nThe officer knocked on the roof of the car with his baton. “No more babble, get out of the car!”\n\n“Okay!” I slowly opened the door and stepped out of the car, Shanice following close behind me. The officers still had their hands close to their guns, ready to grab them at a moment’s notice. The officer closest to us searched us, taking our phones and wallets, before leading us to their police car. The officer receiving the items accidentally lit the display of one of our phones and dropped it out of surprise. His colleague bent down and picked it up.\n\n“Don’t you ever watch the vision box, Earl?” he said. “These devices just released in Japan. If you ask me…” He lowered his voice. “…if you ask me, we’re dealing with two spies here.”\n\n“Turn around and put your hands behind your back”, the short officer said after he placed us next to their car.\n\nI did as I was told, feeling the cold metal of handcuffs being snapped around my wrists, and so did Shanice.\n\n“Please, sir,” I said, trying to appeal to their sense of reason. “We don’t mean any harm. We just want to get out of here and get on with our honeymoon.”\n\n“Don’t tell them anything!” Shanice hissed. “Are you crazy?”\n\n“Your honeymoon will be spent in jail,” said the tall officer.\n\n“As it should,” said the short one as he placed us in the backseat of the police car, “seeing that your marriage isn’t legal here. Or did you get married in Japan?” He laughed. “And then you came all the way here—with your weird little Japanese car, dressed like complete jesters—to celebrate your marriage where it’s the least appreciated? This story just keeps getting crazier and crazier!”\n\nThey took us to a small, dingy police station where we were thrown into a cell. The officers left us there, without saying a word, leaving us to our thoughts.\n\n“What did you mean when you said we weren’t in the US anymore?” I asked, leaning against the bars of the cell. “Are you suggesting this is some kind of alternate reality?”\n\n“That’s exactly what I’m suggesting,” she said. “I think that meteor teared up the fabric of our reality somehow, and—”\n\n“That’s insane!” I shook my head. “We’re dealing with a group of deranged people whose living out some far-right wet dream. It’s just a bunch of QAnon that’s come together in this little backward town and—”\n\n“What about the radio, huh?” Shanice interrupted.\n\n“They could’ve easily hijacked it somehow,” I said. “I don’t know, but—”\n\n“And the strange vehicles? You think they designed and built their own fully functioning make-belief cars as well?”\n\n“What you’re suggesting isn’t exactly more believable.”\n\n“Listen, James, I’m telling you… We passed through some kind of rift in space-time, or—I don’t know—some kind of interdimensional portal and now we’re stuck in a world where the freaking Confederacy won the civil war!”\n\nI spotted a newspaper underneath the bed Shanice was sitting on. I picked it up, hoping it would prove her wrong, but was instead met with more evidence to the contrary. It was called the Richmond Examiner. Based on the date, it was only a week old. The headline of the main story read *Crisis in the Pacific: British and Japanese Fleets Clash*.\n\nI sighed and tossed the paper at Shanice. “They’ve really paid attention to the details. These people are trying to get under our skin, trying to brainwash us—possibly to force us to do something which will—”\n\nShanice, who had picked up the newspaper, interrupted me. “This is *real*. Listen to this, okay?” She began reading from the newspaper. “It has been several weeks since tensions between the British Empire and the Empire of Japan reached boiling point, with reports of a Japanese fleet creating a blockade around the Hawaiian Islands. This comes in response to the Confederate States of America’s decision to allow the British Empire to place nuclear weapons on the islands. The move has been seen as a direct threat to Japanese security, leading to a build-up of military presence in the region.” She paused. “James, they got pictures and everything, and why would they pick *this* as their main story if it was fake — wouldn’t they pick something more domestic?” She continued to read: “The crisis has been escalating, with both sides refusing to back down. The British Empire, with its powerful naval presence in the Pacific, has deployed additional vessels to the region, while the Japanese fleet remains on high alert. The situation is rapidly deteriorating, with fears of an all-out war becoming increasingly real.”\n\n“Anyone can fake anything these days,” I said, “you know that. Let’s just try to think of a way to get out of—”\n\nThe tall officer entered the room. He sat down on a wooden stool in front of us—his earlier aggressive expression now calm—and lit a cigar while looking at us with a piercing gaze.\n\n“I’m Carlos, and I’m the sheriff in this town.” He took a puff on his cigar. “You’re James and Shanice—am I pronouncing that correctly?—Robertson, at least according to those little cards we found in your wallets. On those cards, it actually says you’re from The United States of America. That’s curious, seeing that The United States of America doesn’t exist anymore. Your Japanese equipment tells me you’re spies, hired to accomplish some mission, but then again why would spies come up with some ridiculous fiction rather than trying to blend in? Maybe you aren’t spies at all, but just activists trying to make a statement. If so, I’m guessing you’re a former servant, Shanice, rebelling against the system. I ran both of your names through the calculator, and nothing came up, which is another oddity. Perhaps you’re spies after all. Anyhow, this case is a bit above my paygrade, and my colleague decided to report you to CLEA—”\n\n“What’s that?” Shanice asked. “What’s CLEA?”\n\n“Why, The Confederate Law Enforcement Agency, of course. They’ll pick you and your equipment up and transfer you to Richmond. That’s what’s going to happen.” He leaned forward and lowered his voice. “Here’s the thing, though, I think there’s something more going on than what I’m being told. And I would very much appreciate it if you would tell me what it is. All I know, at the moment, is that something fell from the sky earlier today, just out of town, and now they’ve cut off traffic on Rebel Route telling everyone there’s been a gas leak.”\n\n“Why would we tell you anything?” Shanice asked. “You were the one—”\n\n“I’m going to be upfront with you,” Carlos said with an even lower voice. “I don’t like when the government comes to my town, lying to my face and telling me what to do, and I don’t like how they treat your people.” He looked at Shanice. “I know about *that* lie and it’s the ugliest of them all… In my youth, I worked at one of the so-called *temporary* detention camps after they passed the Return to Africa Bill.” He took a deep breath. “I was just a kid back then, but I understood what they were doing there, and it wasn’t freeing any slaves.”\n\n“What did they do?” I asked, sick to my stomach.\n\n“You’ve already heard the so-called conspiracy theories… Well, I saw it with my own eyes. It’s all true.”\n\n“What conspiracy theories?” Shanice added.\n\n“You really don’t know about this stuff?” Carlos took another puff and looked at us with suspicious eyes. “It was just another slave trade. Only a handful was shipped to Liberia as free men, the vast majority was sold to Belgian Congo and some other colonies where they needed more workers in the mines. But even over there, the need for more workers wasn’t big enough to accommodate our surplus…” Carlos looked down at the floor. “So, they built these large chambers, looking almost like the churches you see everywhere besides the road… And they took them there, the ones unfit—too old, too *young*—and the ones unwilling.”\n\n“Then what did they do,” Shanice asked, tearing up. “What did *you* do?”\n\n“It was so crowded in there, they were all standing shoulder to shoulder, not knowing what would come next… I was just a kid back then, but they still sent me in there to clean up after the process was done. And that’s what I did. This was close to Matanzas and, being of Spanish descent, I wasn’t valued much higher than the former slaves. I was just trying to help my parents pay rent. Anyhow, I won’t be sending anyone of your people their way if I can prevent it. You know, when I see the more rebellious Whigs up north hanging up the Union Flag in their windows or front yards, I wonder what it would’ve been like if things were different, if history had taken another turn, so to speak. It’s a childish fantasy, but… seeing you and your possessions—your strange car, your curious electronic devices, and your odd-looking plastic cards with “The United States of America” written all over them… well, it makes me wonder.”\n\n“We aren’t spies.” Shanice walked up to the bars. “That thing that fell from the sky, it came from space, and it had some kind of effect on—”\n\nA group of men in black cloaks flung open the door and strode purposefully into the room, radiating an air of confidence and command. Carlos stood up and straightened his back, leaving his cigar on the stool.\n\n“Good evening, sir. We are from CLEA,” one of the men said in a deep, authoritative voice. “We’re here to take the prisoners with us, the colored woman and her companion. They’re suspected of espionage and high treason. Would you be so kind as to open their cell?”\n\nHe did as he was told, locking eyes with us but not saying anything.\n\n“This can’t be real,” I said, still doubtful but less so than before. “Hey, don’t touch her!” Carlos let go of Shanice’s arm and allowed her to step out by herself.\n\n“This isn’t right!” Shanice said to Carlos as we were led outside by the men. “You know this isn’t right! It’s all wrong! We don’t belong here!”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe men didn’t say a word to us, they just threw us in the back of a large black vehicle that looked more like a locomotive than a truck. They had already loaded it with our car. Shanice banged on the back doors after they closed them, begging them to let us out, but to no avail. We sat in total darkness as the vehicle drove away. I held Shanice in my arms, trying to comfort her the best I could.\n\n“They’re driving on the open road now”, I said. “If the police spot this bizarre vehicle on the road, they’ll pull it over and—”\n\n“You *still* don’t understand?” Shanice said.\n\nI did understand, and it frightened me more than anything, but I still held up hope that there was a more mundane explanation to all of this.\n\n“I-I don’t know,” I said. “I just don’t know. But we’re going to get out of this situation, one way or another.”\n\nAfter about forty-five minutes the vehicle hit the brakes. I wasn’t ready and fell down, and so did Shanice. We struggled to get up on our feet but then threw ourselves on the floor again when we heard gunshots outside. I crawled up to Shanice, trying to find her in the darkness. We heard people yelling, and then some more gunshots. A man’s voice could be heard behind the back doors shortly after:\n\n“Stay back and take cover!”\n\nHe then shot at the lock, and the doors swung open. We were pulled out of the vehicle by strong hands. It took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to the daylight. Two black men, wielding rifles of a sort I had never seen before, stood in front of us. They wore what looked like fedoras but were otherwise dressed as the men we had seen in the small town.\n\n“Go!” one of them said. “Go, go, go!”\n\nThey rushed us to another vehicle. Shanice stopped in her tracks. At first, I thought it was because of the dead bodies on the road, but then she quickly entered their truck and came out with a cotton bag with the word “EVIDENCE” written on it. It contained our personal belongings. The two men yelled for us to hurry up. Just before I jumped into their car, I noticed Richmond in the distance. The city was unrecognizable from what I remembered. Gleaming white marble buildings towered over the landscape, adorned with grandiose statues and flags bearing the emblem of the Confederacy. At that moment I knew… Shanice had been right all along. This was another Earth.  \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/)",

        "text": "\\~Tuesday\\~\n\nMy name is Maggie and I've decided to document as much of the next week as much as possible on here… it might be all the time I have left.\n\nI've been practicing for months for the upcoming cheerleading competition. It's in exactly a week, next Tuesday, and it's been the only thing on my mind. I've been dreaming of winning the trophy for years and I want, no I'm going to make my team the best in the state. Fate seems to have other plans, but I'm a determined girl.\n\nThere's a secretly growing pathogenic threat. It's caused by a neuro-parasitic infection- a parasite that takes over and controls the host brain and body. It's spread through bodily fluids, and it has unique mechanisms to ensure its continued spread. Scientists are working to slow the spread and the government has contracted some of the top minds for the job. One of those scientists happens to be my dad's brother, my Uncle Jerry.\n\nAs far as I know, the number of infected is unknown as they can blend into society to a degree. They still appear human, and they are smart enough to attack secretly. I often look into the darkness of the woods, and alleyways, when I walk to school. Sometimes I see dark forms lurking in the shadows and walk a little faster. The number of shadows in my town seems to be increasing. Is it like this everywhere, or do I just know what I'm looking for? I'm ashamed to admit that in my 17 years of life, I've never traveled out of my isolated town, much less to another state. Does anyone else see the human shaped shadows in the darkness?\n\nI think Uncle Jerry only told me everything to protect me. First, who would believe me, when I wasn't even sure I believed it before today. Anyway, as Uncle Jerry told me, the infected don't like feeding in sunlight, or even being out during daytime, so they aren't really a threat on a sunny day, and with any common sense they are easy to avoid. He tried to warn me.\n\nAs I walked home from school on this unseasonably warm afternoon, I decided to take a shortcut through a dark alley. It looked empty, safe. It was a mistake that would change my life forever. Out of nowhere, a large form jumped out from behind a dumpster and lunged at me. I screamed and tried to move out of the way, but the creature was too quick. It sank its teeth into my arm, and I felt a searing pain shoot through my body.\n\n\"What the hell! Get off me!\" I shouted, trying to shake it loose. But it was no use. The infected creature had a firm grip on my arm, and it wasn't letting go.\n\nI struggled to get free, but it was too late. It had already bit me. As I watched in horror, beneath the long greasy, stringy brown hair, the infected creature's eyes began to redden.\n\n\"Um, excuse me, can I help you with something?\" I said sarcastically, trying to lighten the mood.\n\nThe infected just growled and continued to gnaw on my arm. I knew I had to act fast if I wanted to survive.\n\n\"Okay, okay, I'll give you my allowance money. Just let me go, okay?\" I pleaded, hoping to reason with it.\n\nBut the infected was beyond reason. It was now fully focused on turning me into one of its own kind. As I felt my arm starting to go numb, and the feeling traveled to my shoulder, I knew I had to get help.\n\nI used my free hand to jab the infected in its sunken eyeball and stumbled out of the alley, clutching my wounded arm. I could feel the infection spreading through my body, slowly turning me. I had to find a way to stop the transformation, or else I would be doomed to roam the earth in the shadows as one of the undead.\n\nAs I stumbled down the street, I caught sight of my reflection in a shop window. My eyes were turning bloodshot, my skin was starting to peel around the wound, and my arm was covered in gore. Also, my hair was a mess. I stopped for a second to fix my long blonde ponytail. I was turning into a monster, and there was nothing I could do to stop it. But I wouldn't be a monster with bad hair.\n\nMy thoughts turned to the cheerleading competition. I've been practicing for months, and now I was changing into an undead monster just a week before the big event. I couldn't let my team down. I had to find a way to stop the transformation, no matter what it took.\n\nI stumbled down the street, my arm throbbing with pain. I knew I had to find my uncle Jerry, the mad scientist, er, freelance biochemist who lived on the other side of town. He's been working for years on a treatment to stop the parasites, and he was my only hope.\n\nAs I approached my uncle's lab, I could hear strange noises coming from inside. I hesitated for a moment, wondering if I was making the right decision. But then I reminded myself that this was my only chance to save myself and my cheerleading team from a fate worse than death.\n\n\"Uncle Jerry, it's me, Maggie!\" I shouted, pounding on the lab door.\n\nA few seconds later, the door creaked open, and a cloud of smoke billowed out. I coughed and waved my hand in front of my face, trying to clear the air.\n\n\"Hey there, kiddo. What brings you to my neck of the woods?\" Uncle Jerry said, grinning from ear to ear.\n\nI glared at him. \"I got bit by an infected, Uncle Jerry. I need your help to stop the transformation.\"\n\nUncle Jerry's eyes widened. \"Whoa, whoa, slow down there. You got bit? How the hell did that happen? Did you go in the dark?\"\n\nI rolled my eyes. \"It just happened. Can you just give me it or not?\"\n\nUncle Jerry stroked his chin, looking thoughtful. \"Well, I do have a treatment that might delay the transformation. But it's not foolproof, and it might have some side effects. It's still in development.\"\n\nI didn't care. I just wanted to stop the transformation before it was too late. \"Give it to me, Uncle Jerry. I don't care about the side effects. I just need to make it to the cheerleading competition.\"\n\nUncle Jerry nodded, pulling a vial of cloudy liquid from his refrigerator, and filling a syringe. \"Okay, hold still. This might sting a bit.\"\n\nI gritted my teeth as Uncle Jerry injected the fluid into my arm. I felt a strange tingling sensation spread throughout my body, and then everything went black.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was lying on the lab floor. I looked around, feeling disoriented. \"Uncle Jerry? What the hell did you do to me?\"\n\nUncle Jerry chuckled. \"Relax, kiddo. You just passed out for a minute there. It's a common side effect. \"\n\nI groaned, rubbing my head. \"Great. Just what I need.\"\n\nUncle Jerry patted me on the back. \"Hey, at least you're not turning anymore, right?\"\n\nI had to admit, he had a point. I felt a little better already, like the medicine was fighting off the infection inside me. I knew I wasn't out of the woods yet, but at least I had a fighting chance.\n\n\"Thanks, Uncle Jerry. You're a lifesaver,\" I said, getting up from the floor.\n\nUncle Jerry grinned. \"Ah, no biggie. Just doing my part to keep the world safe from zombie cheerleaders.\"\n\nI couldn't help but laugh at that. \"Yeah, I guess I owe you one for that.\"\n\nAs I walked out of the lab, I knew that my life would never be the same. I was bitten by an infected, injected with a mad scientist's concoction, and I was soon competing in the cheerleading competition of a lifetime. I have no idea what the future will hold, but I know one thing for sure - it's going to be a wild ride.\n\nI just got home and stumbled into my bedroom, exhausted from the day's events. I can't stop thinking about the side effects that Uncle Jerry had warned my about. I hope that they won't be too severe. As I crawl into bed and my eyelids are becoming heavy, I feel a strange tingling sensation in my limbs. I'm just going to brush it off as fatigue and try to get some sleep.",

        "text": "Don’t neglect your dental hygiene, kids. \n \nI wish I’d taken that advice when I was young. Growing up, I lived on soda and snacks. I guess a lot of kids did, but I’d go through a twelve pack of Coke in a single day sometimes. My parents tried their best to sway me in the right direction, but you know how kids can be with their sweets. So naturally I ended up with cavities. Awesome. \n \nSo I went to the dentist, as one does in such a situation. They did some drilling and filling, the whole nine yards, and sent me on my way. Problem solved… for now. \n \nWell, years later, I got new insurance and hit up a new dentist as a result. He discovered that at least two of the fillings his predecessor billed me for were bogus. There was no evidence of decay there at all. They were just taking advantage of a kid with a sweet tooth to bilk some extra money out of the family. This led me to, as you can imagine, a deep mistrust of the dental profession outside of this doctor. So once the kindly old man who ran that office retired, I just … stopped going to dentists altogether. \n \nI did not, however, stop drinking excessive amounts of soda. Eventually, that caught up with me. It was time to face up to years - actually, damn near a decade - of neglect. I found a new local dentist who had good reviews. I had to have several extractions, a handful of root canals, numerous fillings… it was painful and expensive and I hated my younger self with a burning passion. \n \nBut hey, my suffering was over. It’d just take some time for the gums to heal over, and I’d be all good. There was one sore spot in particular, where one of my back teeth had been badly infected and subsequently plucked out of its socket. But the dentist assured me that was normal and it would itch and ache for a bit then go back to normal as the socket healed over. \n \nBut the itching just kept getting more intense. It was unbearable. I couldn’t exactly scratch it. I applied layer after layer of Ora-Jel to numb the gum, but nothing worked. I was going mad. I had begun drinking heavily just to dull the agony, which was something I swore I’d never do after what happened to my uncle … but I didn’t know where else to turn but to the bottle. \n \nAnd then one morning, I awoke from yet another drunken stupor to the unmistakable taste of copper, blood pouring from my mouth. “The fug-“\n \nThe itchy socket had burst open. I ran my thumb along my gumline, and sure enough… wait, what the hell? \n \nI felt a tooth crowning out of the stitches. What? I’m 34. I lost my baby teeth decades ago. But between the pain and the vodka, I couldn’t really process what was happening. I just haphazardly wiped up the blood, downed a few more Tylenol and went back to bed. \n \nSo, here’s the fun part. I was traveling for work that day, so I was nowhere near the only dentist I trusted. But this was bad. I needed to be seen immediately. I googled around a bit, found one that didn’t look too terrible in the Tucson area, and popped by for an emergency visit. I waited a bit, clutching my jaw in pain, and was eventually taken back for an X-ray. They found that, impossibly, my decaying, cracked molar was patiently awaiting extraction. \n \n“I - I just had that removed last week,” I uttered in confusion.\n \nSmelling the alcohol on my breath, the X-ray tech shook his head. “I don’t know what to tell you, Mr. Harvey. I can see you’ve had extensive work done, so you’re probably just confused, but you can clearly see the tooth right here on this printout.”\n \n“That’s impossible.”\n \n“And yet, there it is. You’re gonna want that bad boy out before the infection gets worse. I have an opening this afternoon -“\n \n“Piss off.” He was scamming me just like that first dentist, I was sure of it. I’d pop some more pills for the duration of my trip, and wait until I got home to see my usual dentist. \n \nHe stopped me with a firm yet gentle hand on my shoulder. He calmly explained that if I didn’t get the tooth removed, the infection could spread and cause a litany of other health issues up to and including death. He procured a few mirrors to show me the physical tooth and demonstrate that there was no trickery in the X-ray. \n \nFine. Insurance wouldn’t cover it, but it hurt like hell and I didn’t want to risk it spreading. Maybe I really was mixing it up with a different tooth I’d had removed. Dr. W had removed five teeth total, and I had been drinking a lot … I guess it’s not out of the question. \n \nExcept a few days after my recovery, I felt that same itching sensation again. And this time, I felt it in one of the other empty sockets as well. \n \nAnd this time, they were … pulsing. \n \nI clenched my teeth reflexively, which was a mistake. I felt my upper tooth dig *into* the lower one as my jaw tightened. It … squished in, and then made an audible pop. \n \nI gagged as my mouth was flooded with an earthy-tasting goop. I spat it out in surprise, costing my keyboard in thick, greenish sap. What the *hell*? And are those … seeds suspended in the liquid?\n \nI grasped my jaw in pain and confusion. I could feel the roots of my tooth writhing and squirming in my gums. The now familiar taste of blood mingled with the sap, forming an absolutely disgusting frothing solution in flavor, texture, and appearance. \n \nBeneath it all, I felt the next “tooth” emerging from its post-surgical socket. I rinsed my mouth with mouthwash as best I could, and gently prodded it with a Q-tip. Sure enough, this one was hard to the touch, but I felt something “give” underneath the enamel coating. \n \nAt this point, panic had set in and completely sobered me up. I felt the sap-filled pustules growing underneath enamel shells throughout my mouth. I screamed. I vomited. I passed out. \n \nI don’t really know what happened next. I woke up in a hospital-style bed at an unfamiliar dentist’s office. I hazily looked around, but didn’t see anyone. I flicked my tongue around my mouth. Maybe it was all a dream?\n \nTo my horror, I found a nearly completely empty gum line across my entire lower jaw, and a handful more were missing from the roof as well. \n \n“Ah, good morning. You were in a pretty bad accident, I’d wager. Not sure what happened, but when your roommate brought you in there wasn’t much to work with. We saved what we could, but… well, I’m here to take a cast for partial dentures,” said the stern dentist presumably responsible for tearing out all of those god-knows-whats from my mouth. \n \nI couldn’t say much in response, between the pain, the analgesics, and the swabs of cotton in my mouth. I just moaned a little. I had so many questions but couldn’t utter a word. \n \nHe took the cast, applying excruciatingly painful pressure to the afflicted sockets with his mold. “I’m so sorry,” he added as he left, almost as an afterthought. He noted that they’d call in a few weeks once the casting was completed, and to avoid chewing in the meantime. Sure. I’d definitely be chewing with the half-dozen teeth I have left if he hadn’t said that. \n \nI went home and drank myself to sleep yet again. I’d given up hope. Honestly, I was about ready to take my own life.\n \nThen I woke up with a full mouth of teeth again. \n \nI’m afraid to chew on them. I can feel the roots squirming and growing beneath the hard shell. I don’t know where these things came from or why. I don’t know if they’re dangerous. Hell, I don’t even know if it’s worse to pop them open or let them fester. \n \nBut I feel the roots burrowing deeper and deeper into my skull in the meantime, and one question dominates my mind now. \n \nWhat happens if they reach my brain?",

        "text": "  \n\nOne October morning I went downstairs to start breakfast and I heard some scratching and clawing coming from the bathroom. In the tub was a rat. It was brown and grey with a bulbous nose, fat and dumpy, with a long naked tail. It couldn’t manage to climb back out of the tub. It was a hideous looking thing. Filthy creatures they are but I’m not cruel. I went and grabbed an old pot I never used and trapped the rodent underneath, scooped it up with a Tupperware lid and took it outside. \n\nI walked to the back alley and slung the rat out of the pot and onto the pavement. It landed with a thud, just sitting there motionless. I turned to walk back to the house. I noticed I had left the door opened. The obese rat darted past me and back into the house. I ran after it, throwing the pot, hoping to knock it off course, but instead I hit the bottom of the screen door. \n\nThe wind picked up and the willow tree next to the house quivered, lashing its thin branches against the gutter. \n\nA woman, clothed in a brown dress and a grey mantle came out from inside the house. She was clutching a knife in her right hand, and a white lily in her left. As soon as I perceived her, she dissipated with the wind. \n\nI felt light-headed, dizzy. I passed out. I don’t remember, but somehow, I made it to my bed. Downstairs I heard scratching and clawing. I swung myself out of bed. Something from under the bed grabbed my leg, letting go as soon as I looked down. There was nothing there. My closet door opened; the lights flickered. Scratching and clawing grew louder. I ran downstairs there was another, or maybe the same rat trapped in my tub. I ran some hot water, this time hoping to teach it a lesson, not to do this again. I went outside to smoke a cigarette, while the tub filled to an acceptable level for escape, or drowning. The smoke was soothing, and the smell placated my nerves. I could hear the water running, and then it stopped. I went back inside the house. \n\nLaying in the tub was a woman, with dead pale skin, in a blue dress and looking up at the ceiling. The bathroom door slammed shut behind me and the light bulb popped, casting me into darkness. I turned and grabbed the doorknob, but it was locked. There was a force behind it keeping the door from budging. I felt a freezing cold hand grasp my wrist and pull me into the tub and under the water. Water rushed through my nostrils and down my throat. I panicked and sucked in more water, thinking to gasp for air, where there was none. My lungs and stomach were bloated with water. I swung my arms violently, grabbing for anything, hoping to pull myself out of the dark abyss. Finally, I was free and able to sit up in the tub and breathe, panting and coughing, snot and water emptying from my nose. I tried to stand, but my legs were weak. I fell back in the tub, vomiting water as I went down. I was alone. \n\nI finally got out of the tub and made my way to the door. Before I got to it, the door swung open. The house was dark and empty, abandoned. There were holes in the floor and walls, and everything from paneling to wallpaper had been stripped. Across the kitchen and in the living room I could see a solitary candle lighting the room. I was still wet from my near-death experience in the tub. A cold light wind blew through the house, pushing the little flame from side-to-side.  The candle was my only light. I walked toward it. There was a smell of decay and rot coming from where the candle was burning. It was intense. It made me sick to my stomach. I fell to my knees, vomiting more water. There was an uncontrollable gag and a jerking of my stomach muscles. I felt something alive in my throat, crawling its way up and out. I felt hair tickling the back of my throat and brushing up against my tongue. With one last lurch, I expunged a rat from my mouth. \n\nIt lay on the floor, barely breathing, then struggling violently, until finally it stopped moving. Next to the candle was a symbol painted on the floor. It was a red circle with some peculiar writing on the edges. An unseen force grabbed me by my hair and violently dragged me to the middle of the circle. My muscles stiffened and I couldn’t move. Standing above me was the lady in brown. She ripped my shirt open and stuck the knife in my hip. \n\n“Jacob wrestled God. We wrestle with Lucifer. There, a ladder to heaven, here a ladder to hell.”\n\nShe took the blood from my hip and painted another circular symbol on my chest. The candle blew out. I was alone in the darkness unable to move. I could hear breathing in the room, and someone scuttling across the floor as if crawling on all fours. And then it was on top of me, belly to belly, mouth to mouth, like Elijah the prophet on top of the dead boy. The boy’s body grew warm, resurrected from the dead, but my body grew cold, preparing for death. My heart slowed, and I could feel the other body on top of my body melting, the burden growing lighter. I was absorbing this whatever, this spirit of flesh. I could hear it talking in my head, with violent musings and thoughts of murder. There was a pain in my chest. I couldn’t breathe. My eyes were watering and I felt like I was having a seizure, banging my head against the hard-wood flooring. \n\nThe next morning, I woke up with a throbbing headache. I threw the covers off of me and checked my hip and my chest. No wound, no blood, my body looked unscathed. I got out of bed and headed downstairs. I started cooking some bacon, and the popping of the grease started to sound more familiar to something I had heard the previous morning. At first it was somewhat muted, but gradually it became unmistakable- it was a scratching and a clawing, louder than normal. I emptied the bacon onto a plate and carried the frying pan with me to the bathroom, but there was nothing in the tub, yet the scratching and clawing persisted, and persists to this day. I know something is in me, rattling in my head, speaking to me. There’s one body, but two souls. The one resembling a man, the other a destructive creature gnawing away at my sanity. Always, and every day, my mind is rambling, scurrying to escape the thoughts, but it's no use, the vermin is here to stay.",

        "text": "When I arrived Hel was already there. Sitting on the floor of the hallway with her head between her knees. I can’t remember what day it was, but it couldn’t be more than three as I still have 5% battery left.\n“I was waiting for you to go in”, she said.\nI could understand, going inside that old apartment was no easy feat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt had been years - probably more than a decade - since I’d been there. The building still looked almost completely empty, apart from the people you could hear across the corridor, but never see. Probably night shift workers, or recluses, like our mom.\nThe whole building has a hollowness to it, in here I feel like my heart is sinking deep into my chest. It’s always been like this, even as a kid, living here. The building has an odd architecture where the windows face this enclosed courtyard of sorts, but so tiny you could seem all the apartments within. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had sworn never to go inside that apartment again, but there I was.\nHel looked distressed but healthy. It was good to see her despite the circumstances. It was good to have company too, especially one that was surely feeling the same heaviness, guilt, fear and anger I was.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe went inside quietly. Despite the small building, the apartment was quite big inside, but made up of a mess of hallways and nooks almost like it wasn’t planned for people to live in. The living room was an even worse mess then what i remembered. The window, i could never forget how trapped it made me feel, looking out at stained concrete walls and blackened windows, with enough of a sliver of the sky visible that you would remember it exists, but no enough to feel alleviated by it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHel called out to our mother a few times, but got no response.\n“I’m really worried this time, Viv, she’s never been this quiet for this long”\nShe had been coming to see our mom a few times a month for years now, been her only company. She never went past the living room anymore though, mom wouldn’t let her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“Let’s go in together, okay?”\nI started to lead the way into the next hallway. We walked past the first bedroom, the one Hel and I used to share. It was still set just like we had left it, the two messy beds on each wall, forming an “L” - we would sleep head to head and whisper fairytales to each other before we fell asleep. I looked at Hel’s face and could tell she hadn’t remembered something as sweet. In fact I could tell what night had come to her mind. The day dad left. The day our mom begged him with all the energy in her heart and all the air in her lungs for him to take us with him, to be freed from us. \nI squeezed Hel’s hand. “Come on” I said as i pulled her away and closed the door behind us. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe turned a left and then a right, walked past the strange nook in the middle, and arrived. Mom’s bedroom. Hesitantly, i opened the door. \nWe could see she was lying in bed, covered in blankets. As we got closer we saw she was awake, and coughing weakly. She looked sick, frail, old. It had been so long since i’d seen her that it took me a moment to understand that this was her, my mother, who i’d refused to visit, just as she refused to leave that apartment, even if just for a walk with her daughter.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDelicately, Hel went to her side and touched her on the shoulder.\n“Mom” She said again. \nAnd our mom’s eyes opened, confused, trying to gather her surroundings as if she had been sleeping for an eternity.\n“Mom, I’m here too” I said, meaning, despite everything, i had come back for her.\nI couldn’t help but tear up, and in my mind i repeated to myself ‘DON’T cry, DON’T put your guard down, don’t let her do this to you again”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“No, no, no, no, no” Mom sounded annoyed. She slowly wobbled her way up to sit on the bed and i could see her eyes were filled with tears too, but angry tears. “Girls, you can’t be here, how many times have i told you not to come in my bedroom!”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHel couldn’t understand her anger, she was too young to remember how hard mom had always wanted us gone. “But mom, I hadn’t seen you in weeks, you weren’t answering me from the living room, we had to come check on you”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“And you brought Vivian into this mess, she was already so far away” Mom replied, with some sorrow to her voice. “You two need to leave right now”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“Mom, you’re sick, you need help” I tried to intervene.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“Can’t an old woman have her final days in peace? I’m dying! It’s about time too! Thank heavens! You think i wan’t to stay alive any longer? For what? The wonders of confined living? Get Oooout!!” Her anger was growing. \nShe pushed Hel aside and struggled to get up on her feet, then she gathered her hands on her sides, took in a big breath and yelled “LEEEEAVEEE!!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe were scared like little girls, but as we saw her slump down to catch her breath we couldn’t help but worry for her health. As much as I felt compelled to, I couldn’t run way like a little girl anymore. “We are not leaving without you, you need to come with us so we can help you”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs our mom gathered her breath to yell at us once more, i looked at Hel and she looked at me. We shared one of those sister moments where we know what we have to do without needing to say a word. For years we tried to get mom to leave that apartment, we tried yelling, crying, promises, guilt trips even deception. We knew none of that worked. So as a last resort we would have to, unfortunately, use force.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“I don’t need your help, I need you to get out of this house! Can’t you see, i belong here, and there’s nothing for the two of you here, nothing!”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“ I’m so sorry, mom, but you need to come with us” Hel said, as calmly as possible.\n\n\nWe grabbed her by the arms and legs. It was surreal to do such a degrading thing to someone who, for better and worse, had raised me. But I just couldn’t let her deprive herself of everything for that place, her freedom, her youth, her friends, love, and now her life. So many times as a kid i wished for someone to come and save me from that place. I had to save myself, and now it was time for me to save her.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe carried her kicking and screaming. She tried to grab at the walls at the bedroom door but we were able to push her through. Then at the corners she propelled her body so hard we couldn’t help but drop her. She fell to the floor like a rock, then scurried away so quickly i could barely believe what i was seeing. She hid herself in the nook. She stood there facing the wall. And started whispering.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe approached her slowly, thinking of how best to get her out of that tight nook. Then all of a sudden she started screaming and kicking at the wall in a mad rage. “You can’t have them!! The deal was between you and me and I have lived, i have LIVED, true to that deal every day of my life. You keep your slimy hands away from my girls!”.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had never seen my mom act in such a deranged way.  I wondered if all that time, since we were kids, she had been like that, and I just wasn’t aware enough to notice. It made me .... desperate. Like a gut feeling of desperation. My mom, this person I thought had wanted to be rid of me and who hurt me in so many ways, she wasn’t a bad mom, she was sick. All that time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere was no time to say anything. Hel and I just grabbed her any way we could and headed to the door. Once we got to the living room, mom found a way to grab onto the television mounted on the wall and throw it at the floor, taking Hel down with it. I wasn’t able to contain her alone. \n\n\nShe ran across the room, crouched over and screamed into her hands. And then at us. \n“YOU CAN’T BE IN HERE WHEN I’M GONE! I was already LEAVING! SOMEONE HAS TO STAY WITH HIM, He will make sure of it. PLEASE, let me stay, PLEASE, it has to be me, it can’t be you”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe were all in tears by then. It was cripplingly sad to see mom in that state. Is that how she felt when she wouldn’t leave the house even when there was no food? When the electricity was cut and we stayed without light for a week? Did she feel like she couldn’t go out without subjecting us to a life trapped inside?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe reassured her.\n“Mom, you are not well, we need to get you help, we only wan’t what’s best for you”\n“We promise it will all be okay”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“We are so sorry”\nThen we tacked her again. I took her by the feet and Hel to her by the arms. We were so close, we couldn’t give up on her now. We walked the long hallway to the exit door. It felt like forever with mom thrusting her body erratically.  I was so focused on geting her through that door, out of that horrible place, finally after so many years. To be free. I didn’t even notice what was happening until the last second.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“Viv! VIV!” Hel yelled at me.\nI came out of my trance to hear a roar and approaching heavy steps coming from deep within the apartment. \n“What is that?” I asked.\n“I don’t know!” \nWe had to use all our strength to get the door open with our mother trying to stop at each step.\nWhen we finally did i looked back and saw an enormous misshaped shadow loom on the hallway floor.\nI was already outside when, in a team effort, Hel and I finally succeeded in getting our mother out of that house. But Hel had kicked back a few inches from pushing mom so hard and had to get her balance back. Before she could do so, though, the door slammed shut in our face, and the locks were turned in a quick unearthly whoosh. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI couldn’t breathe.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n“WHAT DID YOU DO! WHAT DID YOU DO! WHAT DID YOU DO!”\nI was paralyzed as i heard my mom’s scream. I stared at her horrified face, her body violently convulsing in rage, hitting the door whit all its force. I heard my sister’s screams on the other side of the door, her pleading for help. My mind drifted away to one of those nights when we were kids, when Hel told me a scary story about the Mean Man in the hallway. I assured her there was no man there, it was just us, and that i would always protect her.  I thought I understood that time in our lives so well. Maybe she understood better than i did.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt’s been at least a day since I’ve heard Hel through the door. Our mom is no help, she’s been walking the corridor just wailing, uncontrollably. I would too, if i were her. If i had tried so hard to save my kids and failed. I’m so sorry, mom, so sorry i didn’t believe you. I can’t leave either, not with my little sister still inside. God, I don’t know what to do. I can’t just sit here, i need to find a way inside.",

        "text": "Parents tend to overestimate their kids. As a teacher, I confront it all the time:\n\n“Aspen doesn’t deserve this grade. She’s *such* a gifted writer.”\n\n“Lily has *always* been brighter than the other kids.”\n\n“My Jackson would *never* cheat.”\n\nEvery once in a while, the claims are so detached from reality as to make you wonder if these parents even know their children at all. *What do you mean, Jackson wouldn’t cheat? He lit a cigarette in the lunchroom last week.* I think this style of parenting does kids a disservice. How can you help them move forward if you’re not honest about where they’re at right now?\n\nThat’s certainly the kind of father I’ve tried to be to Justine. She’s kind, but she has a serious temper. She’s bright in many ways, but struggles to memorize things. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with saying this. But, admittedly, we parents can sometimes go too far. Sometimes our kids are even *more* impressive than we think. That’s why, if the rest of the world is giving you surprising feedback about your child, you almost certainly need to recalibrate — one way or the other.\n\nBut what do you do when the rest of the world…is just flat-out wrong?\n\nIt all started during the Super Bowl. My buddy Tim came over to watch with me — a lifelong bachelor, he’s been spending a lot more time with me ever since my wife passed away last year. I don’t think he liked her much. But whatever. I could use the company.\n\nJustine, who has suffered from a very serious lifelong allergy to sports, spent most of the night upstairs — though she did ask that I call her down when the halftime show was on. When that moment arrived, Tim looked at Justine as if he’d never seen her before.\n\n“Wow! Talk about a growth spurt!”\n\nJustine smiled shyly at him. Myself, I smiled incredulously. My daughter was a late bloomer, like both of her parents had been — a fact she bemoaned on a regular basis. Though halfway through eighth grade, Justine had not yet cracked five feet. \n\n“What are you talking about?” I said with a laugh. “Has she grown?”\n\n“What do you mean?” Jordan sputtered. “She’s, like, your height now!” I rolled my eyes. At 5’7”, I assumed he was making a short joke. Wouldn’t have been the first time.\n\n“Very funny.”\n\n“No, I’m serious,” Tim said, squinting his eyes at her. “I think she might have you, dude. Go back to back!”\n\nI looked at Justine in disbelief. She, however, kept her eyes trained on the floor.\n\n“Tim. Dude. She’s like, a foot shorter than me.”\n\n“Are…are you fucking blind?!” Tim practically shouted it. He pulled me to my feet. “C’mere,” he demanded to Justine, who reluctantly stood against me. I could feel the back of her head pressed in between my shoulder blades. What was Tim on about?\n\n“Ooookay, you’ve still got her,” Tim said with a laugh. “But *barely*. It’s like, a half an inch, maybe.”\n\nI looked at my friend in utter confusion. “Tim. Not that it matters. But, like, do you know what an inch is?”\n\n“How tall do I look?” Justine asked him suddenly. \n\n“I don’t know, like five-six? Five-seven?” Justine flushed at his response. But not with embarrassment. Or delight. A kind of…nervous energy? I was totally unmoored by both of them at this point.\n\n“On what yardstick, Tim? She’s four-nine. I…wait, are you fucking with me?”\n\nBut he wasn’t. The conversation continued in much the same way, actually getting a bit heated, until I finally got the extendable tape measure from the toolkit. Tim and I measured Justine together. \n\n“Well, sweetie, good news,” I told her. “You have been growing. You’re officially four-eleven now.”\n\nBy this point, the halftime show was over, and my daughter wandered back upstairs.\n\n___\n\nJustine was sick for most of the week following the Super Bowl. Her math teacher sent her to the nurse’s office Monday afternoon because she looked ill. Just as she reached the door, though, she started dry heaving. Right there in the doorway. And then…she fainted. The nurse said she’d managed to stop Justine’s head from striking the floor by maybe half an inch.\n\nTim’s words from the night before echoed briefly in my mind. *It’s, like, half an inch, maybe*. \n\nJustine missed school the next four days and spent them in bed with fever and shakes. I came home from work every day with a different kind of soup and bread from the local bakery, which she said made feeling sick totally worth it. (Fun fact about Justine: her favorite food is soup and bread. She is determined to get a tattoo of a bread loaf behind her ear someday. I have not yet been able to dissuade her from this.)\n\nBy Sunday, she was feeling better, so I drove her two hours south to visit her grandparents — on her mother’s side. We still saw them somewhat frequently, but not nearly as much as we did when my wife was still alive.\n\n“Oh, goodness! You’ve been keeping her from us too much!” My former mother-in-law said when she hugged me.\n\n“I know, mom,” I said. She’d insisted that I call her that when I joined the family by marriage, and it had never felt right to stop. “It’s only been a month or so, though.”\n\n“That can’t be,” she said, gazing at Justine in awe as she talked to her grandfather across the room. “She’s grown half a foot since the last time! She must be taller than her mother was by now.”\n\nI narrowed my eyes at that. “Anna was five-six, mom.”\n\n“Yes! Justine’s about there!” she said wistfully. “Oh…our little baby. All grown up.”\n\nI decided to let it go. \n\nThe night passed without further incident. On the drive home, though, while pondering the strangeness of that conversation, and the one with Tim, I recognized something in a flash. A strange pattern, one that had been slowly emerging over the last few weeks.\n\nJustine has always been a social butterfly. But, she won’t get a phone until she turns 14 — a harsh rule, you might think, but she spends so much time on her school-issued laptop that I can’t bear to introduce another screen into her life yet. Anyway, because of this, her friends ring our home phone off the hook. Sometimes to hang out, but often just to talk. Ellie. Kadence. Zoey. Fiona. A seemingly endless parade of gossip from a seemingly endless parade of thirteen-year-olds. Almost always girls.\n\n*But not anymore*, I thought. For the last few weeks, more and more of those young voices asking if Justine was home had belonged…to boys. Somehow, this had totally escaped my notice until that very moment. My head hadn’t been screwed on quite right since Anna’s death, I supposed. After a moment’s thought, I decided to broach the subject.\n\n“So, uh…a lot of boys calling the house lately.” A master of subtlety, I.\n\nJustine scoffed. “Oh, god. Daaad.”\n\n“What?” I asked defensively. “I can’t ask about this sort of thing?”\n\n“You can ask,” she grumbled. “Doesn’t mean I’ll answer.” She’d been that cagey about everything lately. How her day was. What she and her friends did. For months now, she’d been freaking out if I even went near her bedroom. Typical teenage girl stuff, I presumed. I tried to be good-humored about it.\n\n“I’m just saying, I’ve noticed. Anyone I should be worri—”\n\nJustine dry-heaved.\n\n“Okay, okay, I’ll drop it,” I laughed. “Can’t fault a father for being —”\n\nAnd at that, Justine vomited a harsh gray sludge all over the dashboard.\n\nI was so shocked that I slammed on the brakes right in the middle of the road. A car swerved around me, honking. I gaped at my daughter in open-mouthed horror, watching as she slowly turned to me. \n\nThe whites of her eyes were *glowing*. \n\n“I don’t…Dad, I don’t feel good. I—”\n\nJustine expelled another round of toxic vomit onto my lap. The smell was not of bile, but rotting meat. I gagged myself as it reached my nostrils. \n\n“D-daaad,” she moaned, and then she went limp, head slumped down, her body only kept upright by the locked seatbelt strap. A string of grey sludge trailed from her mouth down to her thigh.\n\nI don’t know how fast I was going as I drove to the nearest emergency room. \n\n___\n\n“*This* came out of her?” the doctor asked when he reached our room. He was holding up a vial of the stuff she’d vomited, perhaps a little farther from his body than seemed normal.\n\nI nodded blankly, looking over at my daughter, unconscious on a hospital bed.\n\n“What is it?” I asked.\n\n“It’s…well, it’s mud, mostly,” he said. “Some chemicals, maybe. Minerals. Smells like sulfur, I think. We won’t know for sure until we have it tested.”\n\nWhat he said didn’t surprise me much. You’d understand, if you’d seen the stuff.\n\nJustine stayed at the hospital for two full days. I called my principal, a great guy, and explained the situation so I could stay with her. I told him everything — except about her eyes, which had shone inhumanly from the passenger seat. But only for moments. I’d probably imagined that.\n\nThe doctors did some tests and ended up diagnosing her with “dangerously low iron.” I’ve got her on a supplement now. That ought to help with the whole vomiting-mud thing.\n\nOh, and they confirmed her height for me. She was too weak to stand, so they measured her while she lay. Not quite five feet, just like I’d thought.\n\n“That…doesn’t seem right,” the nurse said, and measured her again. She looked at her tape and made a strange noise, shrugged, then left for her lunch break.\n\nShe hasn’t been back to school since, but I did attend her parent-teacher conference last week. Partially to apologize for her elongated absence, and partially — as an educator myself, at a different school nearby — to take the measure of her teachers.\n\nThree of them mentioned her non-existent growth spurt.\n\n“I grew fast myself,” her math teacher said. The one who had sent her to the office when she looked ill. “Felt hungry and weak for months. It just takes their insides a little while to get used to the new body, I suppose.”\n\nI nodded, trying to look as understanding of the situation as she sounded. But how could I possibly be?\n\n___\n\nI found a clump of Justine’s long hair in the upstairs shower yesterday. Not the normal few strands. A *clump*. And her fever comes and goes. I don’t have the slightest idea what’s wrong with her. \n\nBut I think she does.\n\nLast night, I began my sleep fitfully. I charge my phone on the dresser across the room at night — if it’s right next to me, I’ll turn the alarm off without getting up and fall back asleep. But I’d forgotten to put it on silent mode for the night. It must have woken me up five times with buzzing notifications coming in. Did I normally start my days with so many messages waiting for me? I did my best to ignore it.\n\nl was finally awoken, for good, by the sound of voices upstairs. *Justine*, I thought in a panic. I grabbed the baseball bat from under my bed. I snatched my phone from the dresser to use as a flashlight and bolted up the stairs.\n\nThere was an odd glow that seemed to be almost writhing its way from under her closed door. The voices were louder now. Chanting. In her room. I reached for the door handle. It was locked.\n\nHer door didn’t have a lock.\n\n“Justine!!” I screamed, pounding on the door with my fist. The voices, in response, seemed to get quieter. But I could still hear them. Rhythmic. Not English. They sounded cruel.\n\nI slammed my shoulder against the door. Once. Twice. On the third try, the frame splintered and the door smashed open. There was nobody. Nobody but Justine.\n\nExcept…that wasn’t quite true. Justine *was* there, standing in front of her body-length mirror. Her back was to me, and she wore a blood-red robe. But her reflection…no. It couldn’t be.\n\nMy daughter was 13 and looked 11. But in the mirror I saw a woman nearly grown. Taller. Prettier. She looked strikingly like her mother had, when she’d been young. And her face looked haughty and proud.\n\nI only glimpsed this for a moment. Justine turned to me, and her reflection was as it should have been once again. But this younger version of her — the *real* version — wore the same terrible expression. She stood amid a circle of candles lit on the floor.\n\nWe looked at each other for a while. Then she spoke, her voice cold:\n\n“Go back to bed, Dad.”\n\nI stood my ground. I had no idea what to do. There was nothing *to* do, perhaps. But I couldn’t leave her. Eventually, I took a tentative step toward her. \n\n“Justine,” I began.\n\nShe stamped her foot — something I hadn’t seen her do for years. Not since she was a true child. She screeched at me in anger, and her voice hardly sounded human.\n\n***“I said, go to BED!”*** The candles around her feet all went out at once. And as she screamed her command, something — some power — lifted me from my feet. I was hurled from the room so violently that my head struck the wall across the hallway. The door slammed shut, and from behind it, I could hear my daughter begin to weep softly.\n\nI sat slumped against the opposite wall for several minutes, half-conscious. Eventually I started to regain my senses. I rubbed my head, dazed. *What the fuck just happened?* I couldn’t see anything. My phone’s light had turned off. As I went to turn it back on, I noticed all the notifications I’d missed that night. There were calls. Eight of them. From my principal.\n\nThere was also a text. I opened it. The principal — my boss, you understand — had typed in all caps: CALL ME ASAP. IT’S ABOUT JUSTINE\n\nSo I did. He picked up on the first ring.\n\n“Hank? Sorry to scare you, buddy.”\n\nI had no clue what to say. “I—”\n\n“Listen, I had a meeting with all the other administrators in the district earlier tonight. And I think I might have some information about what’s happening with your daughter. Why she’s been sick. It’s not good, Hank. Are you sitting down?”\n\nI looked around the hallway and chuckled darkly. “I…I suppose I am,” I said.\n\n“Four other admin were talking, sort of hushed. I overheard. Students of theirs, girls, passing out at school. Terrible fevers. One threw up in the nurse’s office and it was like nothing they’ve ever seen. They haven’t been able to get the smell out since.”\n\n“Jesus,” I muttered. “Is it a virus? Some sort of —”\n\n“Hank, it’s worse than that. Yesterday they found a bunch of…weird shit in one of these girls’ bedrooms.”\n\n“Weird shit?”\n\n“Satanic, Hank. Like, occult shit. For…I don’t know. Rituals. The principal made a call to another parent, they searched one of the other girl’s rooms. She’d been acting funny lately. Other people treating her funny. They found the same shit. Sounds like other parents have been notified. Nobody’s sure what’s going on yet. The girls won’t talk.”\n\n*I* couldn’t talk. For a moment, there was nothing but the faint sound of my daughter, still weeping in her room.\n\n“Hank? I didn’t tell em about your kid, if that’s what you’re worried about. I figured I’d leave that up to you. I mean, who even knows if it’s the same thing. But they’re thinking these girls might’ve been talking in secret online. I don’t know. Conspiring.”\n\nMy throat was dry. “Wh—what have they done? The parents?”\n\n“It’s out of their hands, Hank. There’s a full-blown investigation underway. Some of these girls have been real sick. From what I gathered, though, a couple of ‘em have already been committed.”\n\n“Committed? To the hospital?”\n\n“No, that’s *ad*mitted. Committed to a psych ward, Hank. Why? Do you think…I mean, could your Justine be…?” His voice trailed off.\n\nI was silent. But he took my silence as an answer. Finally he spoke.\n\n“I’ll make sure your classes get covered, Hank. Good luck.” Then the line clicked.\n\nJustine was taken this morning. I spent a long time answering questions from social agencies. I mean a *long* time. Finally, they left. Now, the house is so quiet I want to scream. I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know what to do. I just want my little girl back.\n\nThough, I suppose, I’m not sure how little she is anymore.\n\n___\n\n[x](https://www.youtube.com/c/SergeantDarwin)",

        "text": "“Are you sure about this?” I asked Sean for what seemed like the tenth time in the last two hours we’d been hiking the overgrown trail. The sun was high overhead, filtering through the shady canopy in flares of light as the trees moved with the blowing of the cool breeze. For a late March afternoon, the weather was nearly perfect – crisp and clear, but still warm enough that we’d been able to stow our heavier jackets and trade them out for light windbreakers. “We’ve been walking a while and haven’t seen anything yet.”\n\nSean paused a moment ahead of me, scratching idly at his leg while he checked his GPS.\n\n“Yeah, we’re almost there. Just a little further,” he said with a knowing grin. He knew that I hadn’t been as keen as he was about going off-plan for his little side-excursion, but I also knew there was no way I was going to be able to dissuade him. He had that same look in his eyes that he always got when he’d set his mind to something. “I took a bearing when I saw it and we’ve been staying on course. Shouldn’t be much longer. We’ve been going uphill for a while now and the trees are starting to thin a bit. We should be close.”\n\nWe’d been hiking through Glacier National Park on our annual outing, a tradition we’d kept every year since we left college and went our separate ways. In that time, I married and started a family and Sean continued the whole bohemian wanderlust thing he’d been drawn toward for as long as we’d known each other. Every month or two, he’d send me a postcard from some new exotic location he’d visited, and I’d been keeping tabs on his adventures via his social media posts. Two months prior, he’d hiked through Nepal and visited Everest base camp, while I stood in a cramped conference center amidst an insipid sea of other boring, monochrome, colleagues at yet another in an endless line of pointless trade shows. Our connection was slowly but surely fading, though. As he spent his days drifting from place to place, picking up whatever odd jobs he could to supplement his income, I was focused on my family and the white-collar career that I’d built to provide for them.\n\nAside from our yearly gathering and the few sporadic phone calls scattered around the holidays, we were slowly drifting apart. It was sad to think about losing that connection with someone who’d been your best friend since elementary school, but I supposed it was inevitable – just the way of things. \n\nBecause of this, I was always more tolerant of Sean’s flights of fancy when we were together, despite the fact that they often ran in opposition with my own, more conservative, inclinations. So, when we’d been hiking atop the ridgeline earlier that morning and Sean suddenly stopped and pointed out the odd structure protruding through the trees on the hill opposite us, I hadn’t offered much resistance. \n\nIt was difficult to tell without binoculars from that distance, but Sean was insistent that it looked like an old fire lookout tower. I was less certain, but my eyesight wasn’t as good as his, and it definitely *seemed* like the right shape. We weren’t in fire season, and as I understood it, the towers weren’t manned during this time of year. Hell, I’d even read that some states would rent them out to people as unique weekend vacation rentals. \n\nI always thought that sounded like an interesting idea and had even floated it past Cheryl a couple of times as a romantic getaway concept, knowing full-well that there was little chance she’d be interested in the idea. She was more of a “weekend at a cottage on the beach” kind of woman, though, and never took much of a shine to the idea, so I’d given up on it.\n\nAdmittedly, my interest was piqued when Sean drew my attention to the tower, and even more so when he spied what looked like an old dirt path that wandered through the shallow and forested basin separating us from it. It hadn’t taken much convincing to get me to follow along behind him as we left the main trail and started the winding descent. Truth-be-told, I was enjoying this little adventure, enjoying the feeling of rebelling against my routine-oriented instincts. \n\nWhen we were abruptly stopped by the chain-link fence that stretched forebodingly across the trail, that little voice in the back of my head was chanting a very distinct, “I told you so”, mantra. Old and worn “*No Trespassing*” signs were prominently displayed along the fence line every thirty or forty feet, the paint faded and illegible in places. You could just make out the official seal of some government office, but it was impossible to identify which. I supposed it was probably the parks service or something like that.\n\n“Huh,” said Sean, hands on his hips as he stood before the eight-foot-tall fence, topped with barbed wire. “That’s weird. Why would anyone go through the effort of putting up a fence here?”\n\nI moved to stand next to him, noting how the fence ran to our right and left, lost quickly from sight to the dense trees that surrounded the narrow trail.\n\n“They probably don’t want anyone trespassing on the tower,” I offered, wondering myself at the unexpected placement of the barrier.\n\n“Nah, that doesn’t make any sense,” he said with an absent shake of his head, not taking his eyes off the fence. “They’d just put one around the base of the tower. I’ve seen those before. This looks like the whole area is cordoned off.”\n\nI stood there another moment, silently agreeing with his assertion. It was a mystery, but not one I was overly interested in getting to the bottom of. Finally, with a quick glance to the sunlight filtering through the trees above, I gave him a quick slap on the shoulder and nodded back the way we’d come. “Regardless, we’d better turn around if we want to make it to the campsite before sundown. I don’t want to be setting up our tents in the dark.”\n\nSean turned an amused smile to me, and I could see that sparkle of mischief in his eyes, reminding me so much of that little kid who used to always get me in trouble when we were younger. “You’re joking, right? It’s just a chain-link fence, Jim.”\n\n“I’m not climbing over that thing,” I said, shaking my head with a frown. “The last thing we need is for one of us to break an ankle or get cut up on that barbed wire. Nobody even knows where we are; we should be two hours farther along the main trail by now, not bushwacking our way up to another ridge entirely.”\n\nHe looked back at the fence thoughtfully, moving forward and leaning his weight against the galvanized steel mesh. There was a good amount of give to it and, after a moment’s consideration, he reached down and grasped the bottom edge, pulling it up from the ground. I saw there was easily enough room for a grown man to army-crawl beneath it and groaned inwardly at what I knew was coming next.\n\n“*Come on, Jim*. Get your butt under there and hold it for me. We’re almost there – there’s no sense in turning back now,” he goaded with that same mischievous grin.\n\nI gave a resigned sigh, unslung my backpack from my shoulders, and shoved it under the fence, following behind it on the hardpack trail, grimacing at the stones that dug into my elbows and chest as I went.\n\nWhen I reached the other side, I held the mesh up for my friend and a few moments later, we both stood on the inside, resecuring our backpacks. Sean nodded past me, and I turned to look at the path that continued up the gentle incline. Through the breaks in the trees ahead, I could just make out the straight lines of a manmade structure. \n\nWithout another word, we struck off again, Sean in the lead and I following along behind, adjusting my heavy backpack as I went. The air, though still cool and breezy, now seemed to have an odd feeling to it, as if something had changed slightly with our trespassing. The sounds of the forest seemed somehow subdued, and the sunlight didn’t feel quite as penetrating or warm as it made its way through the canopy overhead. As we walked, I wondered if we were going to have to backtrack all the way back to the main trail in order to make for the campsite we’d registered with the ranger station, or if there was perhaps a shortcut we could take from here that would still allow us to reach the site before we lost the light of the day.\n\nTen minutes later, we emerged from the tree line into a wide and heavily overgrown clearing, underbrush, tall grass, and vines choking the ground as we proceeded, threatening to trip us with each step. In the center of the clearing stood the subject of our quest, the lookout tower. \n\nRising eighty feet or more above the ground, the timber-framed tower looked old and disused, covered in a blanket of creeper vines and green-gray moss that rose halfway up its height. At the top sat a window-lined shack, surrounded by a narrow walkway with wooden rails that appeared questionable in their integrity, at least from this distance. A metal staircase wound its way around and up the structure, rising higher and higher and ending in what appeared to be a trapdoor in the catwalk far above.\n\nAt the base of the tower stood a small cabin, not much larger than the shack that was perched atop the aging structure. A slack electric line swayed loosely in the breeze, running from the tower to what I assumed was a generator housed in a small shed behind the cabin. \n\nThe cabin’s door was closed and locked from the outside by a rusty padlock securing an equally rusty latch, though it looked like the hardware had been indifferently affixed to the frame and door with cheap wood screws, and the shackle appeared to be barely hanging onto the doorframe. The windows of the cabin, all still intact, were grimy and coated with a thick layer of greenish mold, giving the strange appearance of some otherworldly frost that had beset them. The roof and walls of the cabin were covered in those same lush green creeper vines that rose partway up the tower, and the whole area gave me the sense that this location had been abandoned for many years. \n\nDespite my initial misgivings, I couldn’t deny the sense of adventure and discovery I now felt, as if we were some early twentieth-century explorers and we’d just discovered an ancient, treasure-filled temple buried in the heart of the Amazon. I grinned as the theme from *Raiders* floated through my thoughts.\n\nSean gave a hoot of surprise, and I walked over to where he stood, looking at an old Jeep that had been parked next to the cabin and left to the ravages of nature as it slowly reclaimed the whole area. \n\n“Man, I can’t believe they just left this here,” he said, trying to get a good look at the vehicle. The rusted metal and flat tires made it look like it had been here for fifty years or more, but I recognized the body style as one of the newer generations. I estimated that it couldn’t have been more than five or ten years old, at the most.\n\n“I guess leaving a vehicle out here to the elements really does a number on it before too long,” I said, trying to get a look in through the mold-frosted windshield. Unfortunately, all I could make out were the shadowed silhouettes of the seats within. “Too bad. It was probably pretty nice when it was in good shape.”\n\n“Yeah,” he said, lost in his own observations of the thing. “It must have broken down and they didn’t figure it was worth it to have it dragged out of here.” He pulled out his phone and took pictures of the whole area, no doubt planning to upload them to his popular VLOG, where he documented his adventures, allowing others to live vicariously through them.\n\nHe lowered his phone and pressed a few keys, frowning. “Man, service out here really sucks. It’s been up and down all day. You’d think it would be pretty good standing on top of a mountain.”\n\nI chuckled, pulling my attention away from the Jeep and turning it to the lookout tower looming above us. It seemed insanely tall from this position, but it occurred to me that I had no idea exactly how tall most of them *were*. It’s possible that this one was perfectly average. The wooden structure looked surprisingly intact as it rose high above me, and I marveled at what a pain it must have been to build it out here in such a remote location. The creeper vines covered most of it, intermixed with that stringy moss that gave it a furry appearance. I could see that the moss and vines had reached the walkway at the top, and the moss hung over the border like the frayed edges of an old tablecloth.\n\nAgain, I wondered idly how long this thing had sat derelict, forgotten by the agency that had built and manned it. It was almost sad, in a way. It was likely this tower and the cabin nearby had been the home of the ranger stationed here for quite a while. At one point, the whole clearing would have been neatly cut back and maintained, and the tower and cabin kept clear of the encroaching vegetation. It was equally likely that the cabin had also served as a sort of substation for the rangers, where hikers and campers would pass through sometimes and check in or ask directions. Now it sat silently, forgotten and left to die in this sea of trees, long abandoned by those who had built it and kept it company.\n\nA wave of motion swept across the creepers above me, a breeze too high for me to feel sending the ivy-like leaves to move in patterns very reminiscent of ocean waves.\n\nThe hollow echo of boots on metal drew my attention, and I looked over to see Sean mounting the blanketed staircase.\n\n“What are you doing?” I asked.\n\nHe just grinned and waved me over. “Come on, Jim. Let’s take a look upstairs. It’s gotta be a hell of a view.” \n\nBefore I could protest, he was climbing the steel-tread stairs, hand lightly gliding atop the tubular railing as he went. With a last look around the clearing, I surrendered to my friend’s enthusiasm and followed him up the stairs that ascended the tower in a squared spiral. Although the voice in the back of my mind warned of the obvious dangers, of decayed timber and rusted metal, it was quickly overridden as I rose above the ground, my footfalls a muted ringing that seemed too loud in the quiet that had, at some point, settled over the forest around us.\n\nUp and up, I climbed, the forest floor falling away below me as we approached the soaring canopy of the old trees. Looking down, I paused a moment, marveling at how small the ranger station seemed now, roughly centered in the broad clearing. I could see the vine-covered jeep on the side of the small building and the generator shack behind it. Turning away, I watched as Sean disappeared around the corner above and ahead of me, continuing his climb. I followed, quickening my pace to join my friend.\n\nWe broke free of the treetops a few flights before we reached the catwalk of the lookout shack, and I had to stop again and stand in awe at the view that stretched out in all directions around us. The forests that covered the hills and valleys seemed almost like we were in the middle of some great green sea, surrounded by the frozen crests and troughs of its immense swells. A cool wind found us now and tugged at my hair and nylon windbreaker, trying to chase away the sudden warmth of the midday sunlight that now had an unobstructed path to us. \n\nI looked downward, my eyes following the lines of the tower structure as it dropped away through the trees and into the heavily shadowed forest below. Even though we had only just been there, it felt distant somehow, slightly unsettling and much darker than it had seemed previously. Now that we stood in the afternoon sun, the clearing below was a sharp contrast, lush and alive, but also hidden and in some way, secretive.\n\n“Jim, up here,” called Sean, and I quickly jogged up the last few flights of stairs to join him atop the tower catwalk, where he had dropped his pack and now leaned against the waist-high, wooden railing that bordered it. He was lost in the moment, the sun shining on his face as he gazed with a childlike wonder at the vista stretching out before us. A fleeting moment of unease almost caused me to chastise him for trusting his life with what was probably not the most reliable of structures, but I knew it wouldn’t do any good, so instead I set my own backpack next to his, against the wall of the shack, and stood next to him.\n\n“Man, this is an incredible view,” he said. \n\nI just nodded.\n\nWe stood there for another moment before he straightened and walked around the corner of the window-lined shack, looking for the door. I followed, trying to peer through the glass as we went, but that same mold or mildew that we found on the cabin windows below also clouded these, obscuring any detail within.\n\nHe found the door and I was mildly surprised to find that the creeper vines and moss had managed to climb this high, out of the shadowed forest to take hold even up here, though they seemed a little grayer and less insistent on their grasp, and I didn’t think they fared very well in the direct sunlight. Even so, they had tangled in the door and Sean had to lean his weight into it and push hard to swing it inward, tearing and snapping the vines away as he did so.\n\nWe stepped through the threshold into what felt almost like we were stepping into a greenhouse, much of the interior walls and surfaces having surrendered to encroachment of the vegetation. Along one wall was a small cot, the mattress and sheets torn and decayed and stained green with mold. A small writing desk occupied the opposite wall, and a square wooden table stood sentry in the center of the room, covered in the deteriorated remains of notebooks and loose pages. \n\nThe air in the shack was strangely humid and close, and the heavy scents of nature filled my every breath, the calm serenity I often associated with it now oddly absent. The light of the afternoon sun struggled to penetrate the clouded windows and instead cast a greenish tint to even those surfaces not already covered by vegetation. The corner of the room nearest the cot was a tangle of leaves and vines that formed a small mound, likely where the vines received the least amount of direct sunlight and allowed them to flourish.\n\nI became aware that I’d been unconsciously holding my breath for a moment, still standing just inside the doorway, and felt a quiet warning at the back of my mind, an uncomfortable sensation that urged me to leave the tower and get back to the main trail. \n\nIt was then that I realized how much time we’d spent in our unplanned exploration, and how the sun had continued its descent towards the western horizon. This early in the year, we probably only had a couple hours of good daylight left, and a quick mental calculation told me that it was unlikely we’d make it to our prearranged campsite before full dark, even if we were fortunate enough to find some sort of shortcut from here. I cursed under my breath, aware that we’d likely be stumbling through the dark on the trail and forced to try to find a suitable area to set camp for the night.\n\n“Okay, Sean, time to go,” I said, stepping back out of the doorway and onto the catwalk. “We need to get back to the main trail, post-haste. As it is, we’re going to be hiking in the dark for a bit.” I walked around and picked up my pack, noting with mild surprise that some of the vines had already managed to attach themselves to it, clinging to the fabric as I pulled it away. I looked through the open trapdoor in the catwalk at the dizzying view to the ground below, the muted greens of the vines obscuring most of the steps and causing them to blend into the background beyond, giving the disquieting illusion that they had somehow vanished, and I was staring at an eighty-foot freefall. It was strange, but I could no longer clearly discern any of the metal steps through the blanket of creepers. Of course, with the light beginning to fade, most of the tower was cast in growing shadows, and I wrote it off as an optical illusion.\n\n“Sean?” I called back over my shoulder. When I didn’t get a reply, I shook my head and ducked back into the doorway, finding my friend standing at the central table and leafing through a notebook he’d found. \n\nHe looked up at my arrival, an unreadable expression on his face as he nodded at the handwritten pages. “I found a logbook left by the ranger – check it out. It’s strange, though.”\n\n“Come on, Sean. Take it with you and you can read it later. We need to get going,” I said, not bothering to keep the frustration from edging my tone. \n\n“Hang on a sec, Jim,” he said, turning his attention back to the weathered pages. “These pages are dated from October of last year; this thing is only five months old.”\n\n“That can’t be right. It’s obviously just a mistake,” I said, growing more impatient. “This place has been abandoned for years. Let’s go.”\n\n“*Just listen a second,*” he snapped, and the insistence in his voice quelled my growing irritation. \n\nWhen I fell quiet, he started reading aloud. \n\n“*October 15th – After two days at my new posting, I am starting to feel a little uncomfortable out here. I can’t really put my finger on it, but it feels like there’s something here with me. It’s like I’m never alone, no matter where I am or what I’m doing. Not sure what to make of it. The weirdest thing is the lack of animal life around here. It’s like they avoid this area for some reason. It’s damned eerie.”*\n\n*“October 16th – Spent all day cutting back the vines from the tower and station. I’m going to need to see if I can get some sort of herbicide to keep them in check. Last night the generator cut out and I discovered that the filter and carburetor were completely blocked up by the moss. It took me nearly an hour to clear them and get it running again. Nobody told me that most of my duties here would be as a landscaper, or I’d have brought my floppy hat and gardening gloves with me.”*\n\n*“October 18th – I’m not sure what’s going on. I know I heard some weird rumors about this place before I accepted the posting, but they all sounded like BS to me. Now I’m not so sure. The generator is down again and I’ve decided to stay in the lookout tower tonight. Tomorrow, I’ll need to figure out my next move for sure, but I’m done here. They’ll need to find someone else to man this station. What the hell is going on out here?”*\n\nSean stopped reading and looked up at me, his face a mask of confusion in the slowly waning light of the afternoon.\n\n“What else does it say?” I asked, now very interested in the logbook for some reason.\n\nHe looked up at me and shrugged. “Nothing. That’s the last entry. He must have booked it out of here the next day.”\n\n“Yeah,” I said. “But if this ranger was so gung-ho on getting out of here, why did he leave his Jeep? You can’t tell me he decided to just hike out of here.”\n\nA disturbing thought struck me at that moment and my eyes wandered hesitantly to the mound of vegetation in the corner of the room, which I now recognized to be unusually large and strangely formed, as if concealing something. \n\n“*You don’t think-,*” I said, my words trailing off.\n\n“*No way*,” Sean said lowly in disbelief, dropping the logbook to the table and moving cautiously to the shadowed corner near the cot, eyes fixed upon the mass of vines and ivy.\n\n“Sean-,” I started, some unarticulated warning creeping into my tone. But I didn’t know what else to say, and the words died in my throat.\n\nHe reached the mound and crouched carefully, tilting his head and peering intently into the green shadows, trying to discern any detail within. He looked back at me a moment, as if to reassure himself that I was still there, and then cautiously reached his hand out to clear some of the vines for a better look.\n\nIn that moment, I caught a glimpse of khaki peeking through the leaves, and of something bleach-white encased within the cloth. \n\n*Bones?*\n\nI gasped sharply and took an involuntary step backwards, bumping into the table and knocking the logbook to the floor. Sean jerked his head around at the sudden sound and lost his balance, reaching out reflexively to steady himself. \n\nHis hand sank into the pile of vegetation, and he gave a sharp cry of pain. I saw then that the leaves of the vines hid long, evil-looking thorns the length of my fingers and glistening shiny black in the dim light. He cursed and tried to jerk his hand free, but something held him in place.\n\n“*Ow! Shit, that hurts!*” he hissed, struggling to free himself.\n\nWith a sudden rustling movement, the vines had constricted around his wrist tightly, the wire-like lengths snapping like a spring-loaded snare. Once his hand was trapped, they continued tightening until the flesh beneath them abruptly parted, opened as neatly as by any razor blade. Sean howled in pain and fought frantically to disengage himself from the tangle, blood pumping from the terrible wound and staining his yellow windbreaker a nightmare tie-dye of crimson.\n\nWithout another thought, I leapt forward and reached for his free hand, to lend my strength to his own and pull him free, but before I reached him, his struggles upset his balance once again and this time he fell headlong into the writhing mass of green and red. In an instant, the vines surged over him, enveloping him down to his shoulders with a sickening hunger.\n\nI drew back in revulsion and fear, my mind not able to process what I was seeing.\n\nThat’s when he started screaming.\n\nIt was a horrific, blood-curdling shrieking of raw terror and suffering, as he lay face-down in the pile of brutal thorns and vines that now covered his upper body, writhing and legs flailing wildly, oblivious to the awful lacerations he was suffering in the process. Blood now slicked the floorboards beneath him, and his cries were muffled and distant. I could only stand there in mute shock, watching him helplessly as his struggles gradually began to slow and grow weaker. \n\nNot long after, he fell silent and still and didn’t move again.\n\nI don’t know how long I stood there, unblinking, unbelieving.\n\nAlone. \n\nI know that when I did finally gather my senses and turn to flee, I discovered to my horror that the vines had stealthily expanded across the doorway to the shack, blocking my only exit. My only escape.\n\nI sit here now atop the table in the center of the room, only a few feet away from what’s left of my best friend. I’ve tried over and over to get some sort of signal on my phone, but the single bar that periodically appears is elusive and fleeting, never present long enough to make a call for help.\n\nI’m writing this post locally on my phone, hoping that it will automatically transmit when the signal returns. \n\nThose vines have covered the whole floor now and I can see in the light of my cell phone that they’ve started climbing the legs of this table. If it were closer to dawn, I might have more hope – I think these things shrink from the sunlight. But dawn is six hours away, and the vines are getting closer.\n\n [It won't be too much longer now.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_JIsvWfQr41ant2OGjmJkg)",

        "text": "With everybody talking about it, I couldn't resist the urge to dive into the depths of AI, and as a result, I stumbled upon an image generator that was unique in its kind. Although the visuals it produced were terrifying and gruesome, they were also extraordinarily lifelike. The AI almost appeared to have a warped sense of creativity.\n\nI kept generating new photos, and each time I did so, I was dragged down a rabbit hole that gradually got darker until I came across a bizarre address. I wasn't familiar with the location before, so I couldn't help but feel obligated to look into it.\n\nI noticed that the destination was an abandoned warehouse shortly after arriving there. The area appeared to have been unoccupied for some time, but, there was an odd atmosphere filling the room. The structure appeared to be waiting for me almost as if it were alive.  I inhaled deeply before stepping inside.\n\nThe environment was cloudy, moldy, and overpowered by the stench of decay. I heard unusual noises as I proceeded deeper into the building that I couldn't identify. I felt like there was something moving, but I couldn't see anything. I eventually found a room that was distinct compared to the others.\n\nA man was being taken prisoner by a frightening entity in a tight, claustrophobic environment. Its only feature was a mouth full of razor-sharp fangs, and it lacked a face. it had simply empty eye holes, without any eyeballs. It had a long, slender physique, and long, skeletal fingers that seemed as though they were reaching out to the captive man.\n\nWhen I realized that this was the same thing that was generating the horrifying and violent images, my blood began to run cold. I had a sensation of dread as I couldn't comprehend such a thing can exist in the real world.  The creature began approaching the captive man as I watched. I knew I had to react to assist the man as he was visibly terrified.\n\nI desperately looked for anything that might aid me in defeating the monster.I came across a large metal pipe on the floor. I snatched it and walked up to the monster, eager to release the imprisoned man. I felt delighted when the pipe made contact with the monster's body as I swung it in its direction\n\nI was astonished to see the monster making zero movement. It almost appeared as though the pipe had no impact on it. I repeatedly swung the pipe, but the thing just stood there motionless. When the creature finally turned its back on me, a wave of terror rushed over me.\n\nI slowly started to back away since I realized that I was no match for this thing.  I moved close to the door and the monster started to approach me, reaching out to me with its extended, bony fingers. Knowing that I was out of time, I forced myself to hurry up.\n\nI eventually slammed the door in my face and sprinted down the street, my heart racing. I was conscious of my near-death experience and couldn't fathom I had been so idiotic as to test the boundaries of artificial intelligence.\n\nI swore to myself to never again interfere with things I didn't quite understand after that day. I had learnt my lesson the hard way, and I was aware that the atrocities I had seen in that abandoned building would live with me eternally.",

        "text": "Hello, I am Jacob Nayman, 17, and I am a senior in high school.  I love dancing, video games, and making videos.  Last year my teacher died of lung cancer which truly horrified me and my fellow classmates. My dad, who is a therapist, is very spiritual. He had just divorced my mom the year broke because of the drugs she did.  It got so bad for my mom that she overdosed and died.  My dad is the only one I have left.  All the kids at school bully me and I have only one friend friend. My friend is named Zachary Gerald Roberts.  He is also 17 years old and usually stars in my videos.  We have known each since we were 5 years old where we both went to theater camp. I think all the teachers also hate me.   He had a meeting with my teachers wife the day after because she had no where else to go and knew me and my dad through my teacher.  During the meeting she asked to go to the bathroom where she was screaming really loud but she stop about 10 minutes later.  When she didn’t come out or answer an hour later my dad went in to make sure everything was ok.  What my dad ended up seeing wasn’t a lady on a toilet but was a mangled up body .  It was so disfigured and almost recognizable, the only thing letting us know it was her was her decapitated head.  My dad had to go to court and was found guilty for the crime he didn’t commit.  He told me before he left to try and contact the spirits of the wife and teacher.  I took out the old Ouija board from my basement.  It was super old and dusty. I started asking questions but no one seemed to reply.  That was the first time I saw “the ghost”.  She said she was my teacher's wife stuck in my house but there was something off about her.  She looked  like my teacher’s wife but also slightly uncanny and different.  \n\n\nAlthough scared I confronted her about it and she said “Spirits look different, younger, when they die.” She started to fade away and even though I was scared I tried to head upstairs and go to sleep.  Right when I almost feel asleep she came back telling me “Jacob, turn on the news.” Right then the tv turned on saying “Breaking News: Robert Nayman has been found dead.  He was found decapitated in his cell just 15 minutes ago. The police are trying to figure out what happened.” The tv turned off as I heard banging down stairs.  I ran to see what it was to see my very own dad, with his head in his hands, in my kitchen.  He seemed to be bringing it to the bathroom.  I started balling my eyes out and screaming.  Once my dad made it into the bathroom I realized, the spirit wasn’t my teacher's wife.  I walk over and see the thing eating the head and body of my dad growing fatter as a fatty oil oozes out of her pores.  Its fat body attempted to crawl after me but was so huge that its flabs of moldy juicy fat slowed it down.  I am currently writing this in my closet.  Update, I hear it’s fat banging upstairs and hear it’s big nose sniffing for me.  Please someone help me.  Every passing second it gets closer,  I hear its oils and juices and cries.  It sounds like 100’s of voices, maybe it’s all the spirits it ate. The door knob it’s turning. Please help, oh lord! \n\nHello this is Zachary, Jasob’s friend.  I came over to check on him after he didn’t reply to my texts.  I knew his password because it was his birthday.  He is nowhere to be found. There is blood everywhere including his phone.  From this text I’m guessing something terrible happened to him.  He would never lie.  I have contacted the police about everything and they should arrive soon.  I hope he is alive and he did actually lie for once.  I am posting this on Reddit to see if anyone knows what happened or how to help me.",

        "text": "Jackson Dent wasn’t— *isn’t* a nice boy. Others speak of him in the past tense, viewing his bedridden body as little more than an intubated corpse. They’re right, but the boy isn’t dead. His soul has simply flitted elsewhere, hunting a new host.\n\nMany people see dreams as parallel worlds, but they probably don’t realise that they’re right. Now, I don’t fully understand this alternate plane of existence, but I *do* know — after consulting knowledgable occultists in the coldest corner of the internet — that my nightmares of Jackson Dent are real.\n\nThen again, the barbarous bully had long encaged me in a waking nightmare. His reign of evil continued until a tragic event at the end of sixth form. A squabble between Dent and another boy — one of many victims — ended with the bully stumbling into oncoming traffic. He’s been in a coma ever since.\n\nThat was nearly a year ago. I’m currently over halfway through my first year at university. I still talk with friends from my hometown. Few people mourn the loss of Dickhead Dent, as he was known behind closed doors. I’d almost put the comatose cretin out of my mind until last weekend.\n\nSaturday night was a sober affair. I don’t want you to make presumptions based on the tale I’m about to tell. I may be a student, but this was no drunken delusion. My dream was real. Of course, I didn’t realise that at the time.\n\nThe dream began as all dreams do. There was clarity to the concept, but not the visuals or sound. Matter is woolly and indistinguishable in the dream realm, isn’t it? But not *everything* — not in this dream.\n\nI was back at high school. Walking the hollow hallways, I became acutely aware of my click-clacking shoes. Dreams are usually soundless, in my experience. And the farther I walked down the corridor, the more lucid everything became. The colours burned with such violent vibrancy, throbbing like a breathing organism. The lockers were covered in scribbles. Horrifying words that chilled my core:\n\n*Weak Will*\n\n*Sticks and stones*\n\n*I’ll take your bones*\n\nAnd then a ringing sound consumed me. It ascended towards a deafening crescendo. It chilled my flesh, but not nearly as much as Jackson Dent, who was standing at the other end of the hallway. There was nothing supernatural or embellished about his dream form — he had always been frightening enough. A gangly boy with overgrown, unwashed black hair and a smile that evoked evilness in its purest form.\n\nThe smile slowly widened, and he uttered some parting words:\n\n“Let’s trade, Will.”\n\nWhen I woke from my night terror, drowning in sweat, I spent most of the day researching the meaning of dreams. I sought psychological answers but found spiritual ones. I fell down some deep rabbit holes, and I eventually stumbled onto an occult forum. Strangers told me that Jackson’s soul was trying to find a host. One of them teased that it was a *Nightmare on Will Street*, which I didn’t find very amusing.\n\nI still wanted to believe that it was nothing more than a lucid dream. That belief quickly dissipated as the day continued. I hadn’t slept well, obviously, but I was awake — mostly. I started to daydream during lectures. Perhaps that’s how he found me. Is a daydream still a dream?\n\nWell, anyway, I caught glimpses of that ghastly grin on the faces of strangers. I know that makes no sense, but it was Jackson’s smile. It was worn by my lecturer and various students in the lecture hall. It was worn by an old lady with a stroller, a businessman, and a toddler on my walk home. Yawning incessantly, I kept pinching my hands and slapping my cheeks, much to my friend’s amusement. I hoped to make the hallucinations stop by waking myself up.\n\n“Are you okay?” Frank asked.\n\nI turned to face him and screamed until my voice cracked. Jackson’s head sat atop Frank’s body. Not just his smile, but his barren brown eyes and lengthy locks of hair.\n\n“What’s the matter?” Jackson Dent asked, grinning malignantly from my friend’s body. “You look weak, Will. Want somebody else to take the reins?”\n\nFrank/Jackson placed a tentative hand on my shoulder, and his palm started to melt through my clothes, as if the bully were hoping to assume control of my body through symbiosis. The paranormal parasite toppled his head to one side, perceiving me with inhuman eyes.\n\nWhat saved me was that I had stumbled into the road. A white transit van screeched to a halt before me, and the sound of burning rubber, alongside a piercing car horn, *finally* snapped me out of my sleepy stupor. I was standing in the middle of the road, darting my eyes between a frustrated van driver and my horrified friend on the pavement — Frank’s face, fortunately, had returned.\n\nI’m currently on Hour 20 of sleeplessness, and I don’t know how much longer I can last. I’ve made a post on that occult forum, asking for help with my situation, but nobody’s responded yet. I need a solution because I can’t stay awake forever.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11els63/i_worked_for_a_party_line_once_and_wont_ever_again/",
        "text": "Are any of you familiar with something called a 'party line?' \n\n\n\nThe last time I remember seeing an ad for one was when I was a teenager. I used to like staying up late, waiting until my parents went to sleep to indulge in my nightly bong hits that were necessary to put me to sleep because I was, and still am, an insomniac. They would usually come on after 1 AM and would pop up during commercial breaks until 3 AM or so, depending on what channel I was watching. They would always feature the same gimmick. Women could call in free and connect with 'local', and supposedly single, men. The men, however, had to pay per minute to use the line. The commercials would always have some nubile, slender, super model looking woman in lingerie or skimpy clothes just hanging out in bed or on the sofa, smiling and laughing on her cordless telephone. If you couldn't tell, the concept is a bit archaic. Chat rooms and forums, even things like Omegle, would make the party line concept kind of obsolete, considering they're usually free for all and some didn't require you to be 18 or older with a credit card on file like the party lines did. \n\n\n\nI never really got into them. I was too young to call in when I saw the ads and, when I got older, I assumed that they were obsolete. Not to mention, I'm an introvert and typing has always been easier for me than speaking to someone. I preferred the chat rooms and forums (like Reddit) that I assumed had all but taken their place. There is just something about being able to hide behind the screen of a phone, tablet, or computer that summons my extrovert alter ego forth to speak in my place. I had pretty much forgotten party lines existed until recently. \n\n\n\nI was one of those misguided souls that saw success with their online small business during the pandemic and ultimately quit my job in 2021 to keep up with my shipments as a sole proprietorship and the one handcrafting every item I had listed, each customized and personalized, I couldn't easily juggle having a standard 9-5 on top of it. My crafts became more than a hobby and for a short period of time I enjoyed my success. Everything changed last year with the economic shifts echoing issues the pandemic had created or set in motion that ultimately came to a head during this past year. I needed to re-evaluate my pricing, my inventory, and how I wanted to proceed with my business with inflation and people becoming more frugal with their spending. This, and the platform I used to sell my crafts on jacked their commission rates up and the customers using the platform became more expectant of next day shipping on items that took me literal weeks to make and finalize just one of. I couldn't just throw in the towel though. I still had orders to fill and I couldn't keep up with my current demand if I went back to the 9-5 thing. I started to look for other options, something I could do at home to fill my downtime that offered me enough extra cash to cover living expenses. \n\n\n\nSo, I started looking for opportunities in remote work. You would think with the recent shift toward more remote job listings that finding something to accommodate me wouldn't be that difficult, but when I wasn't sure that the job listing was some kind of scam, I was competing for positions that were already filled by the time I even saw the listing or filled out an application. I was frustrated and desperate. I had to close my shop to get ahead of my orders which left me with no income. I needed a solution that would make me some money fast and I wasn't about to start selling drugs or my body for some quick cash. I was considering pawning pretty much everything I owned, though. \n\n\n\nI had been checking my email one morning and came across an email that had 'Voice Acting Opportunity, Great Pay, Women Only' in the subject line that hadn't been sent from any of the employment websites I had signed up to receive leads from. The body of the email was pretty vague, but I was able to figure out that it was actually one of those 'party lines' that I had learned about from those late night commercials years ago that needed women to populate the line as there were always more male callers than female callers. They paid per minute like a phone sex line and offered weekly direct deposit with a super low deposit threshold that was awesome.\n\n\n\n Deep down, I knew that they WERE a phone sex line, more or less. The draw of the standard party line was that you were connecting with local singles, but this company didn't seem to advertise themselves the way the lines I saw on television ads back then did. When I clicked on the link to visit the website and do some research to at least verify that the opportunity was legitimate, I was sent to a polished homepage that outlined the position, the per minute rates, and what would be expected of you as an applicant. I was in a relationship and lived with my boyfriend at that time\n I was worried that my man would be somewhat pissed off that I was essentially flirting and seducing other men on the party line, but I rationalized it in my head as it being a means to an end. We were struggling to just pay our current rent and I knew that our landlord was about to raise it another $200 the coming year and we couldn't afford that with just his income alone. We barely afforded it when I was turning a decent profit off my sales. \n\n\n\nAfter doing the math for hourly pay, I figured that I would make something like $18-$36 an hour depending on how many callers there were on the line due to surge pay rates. Of course, that sold me. I didn't see anything else where I could sit at home, work on my crafts and fill orders, all actively while making a living wage (or at least a decent one) talking on the phone with strangers. Despite the fact that I loathed talking on the phone, it was the best opportunity I had found. I thought it would be silly to pass it up. I would at least give it a shot. If it didn't work out, I would find something else. I quickly filled out the application and submitted it without a second thought. I would get a notification that my application had been accepted within a few hours. \n\n\n\nThe acceptance email wasn't automated, to my surprise. It was written by a human that had a name (Janet). I would find out that the company was entirely female owned and operated, where the support team and moderators were also 'talkers' on the party line, which was cool. The email outlined what I would need to submit for my payment info and I had to fill out a standard W9 form for work as an independent contractor, unaffiliated with the platform itself. The very last thing that I had to do before I could go live was complete an orientation call with one of the moderators that would explain how everything worked and what they were trying to achieve. There was a calendar with time slots available and I was able to choose one for that evening. Everything up until that point went smoothly and I was pretty confident that I wasn't giving my personal info out to some scam artist. \n\n\n\nThe orientation call made things even more real and comfortable for me. Naturally, I put myself on mute and set my phone down on the counter while I began to mix a batch of resin for one my projects while we waited for other would-be talkers to join the conference call. The woman hosting the conference call was named Gina and she was much older than I am, which didn't surprise me. I assumed that I would be dealing with people 5, 10, even 20+ years older than I because of how long the whole 'anonymous chat line' concept had been around. She explained that she used to call into party lines with her girlfriends in college. The first time, they called together just to see what it was like, all of them huddled around the corded phone they had in their dorm which reminded me of times my friends and I would pop on random webcam chat sites together and just fuck around with strangers. This was no different in my mind. She would go on to say that it became somewhat addicting to her and she called in a lot after that when she was alone. When she found out decades later that she could get paid for doing something she loved doing, she ran with it. Gina said that she had grown kids and a husband so she preferred logging in to the chat line late at night when hubby and the kids were asleep, which I planned to do myself. It was hard enough for me to have a conversation with my own mother when my boyfriend was home and doing things (loudly) in the background. I figured I would call in when he was at work or late at night when he was asleep. \n\n\n\nGina explained the rules, which were minimalistic. The main rule was that we should never give out any personal information on the phone line, which was a no-brainer. She explained that some callers may think that, after talking with you on the line for months or whatever, that asking for your phone number or email address to contact you instead is acceptable, but she warned against it and told us to come up with whatever reason we wanted to avoid doing so. For our privacy, we were advised to create a fake name, a handle that we would go by on the line. She also said we could even go so far as to create an alter ego or character for our chat line persona. Since there was no way for callers and talkers to identify themselves other than their voices - no profiles, no photos, no ID numbers- that we could essentially be whomever we desired, but to try and keep it simple so that we could stick to our story once we started getting regulars. \n\n\n\nThis opened up a world of possibilities in my mind. Aside from telling us that we are not to, for any reason, disclose that we are getting compensated for our call time, Gina stressed a final rule that was probably one of  the most bizarre things I have ever heard in a job related orientation. \n\n\n\n\"Never, ever, connect with any caller or in a chat room that mentions 000343.\"\n\n\n\nI didn't really question it then. I was sure that she was referring to maybe a scam or something that some callers got away with. I made note of it and hung around for a few minutes to listen to questions the other girls had before hanging up on the conference call. We were told that we would receive another email from the admin within the week that would contain our login information to start working on the line. I was excited to give it a shot. I had already come up with a fake name and birthday, but kept my own appearance and other details / interests so I wasn't fumbling to pull those things out of my butt when I was on a call. I got pretty good at pretending to be Kali from Virginia, a buxom and bubbly blonde that was literally the opposite of everything I was in real life, save for having big boobs, which hardly mattered when taking anonymously on a party line. I could have been hideous, a paraplegic, an abomination spawned through genetic experiments. It's not like the caller would know any better. That was kind of what I liked the most about doing it. I was never judged right off the bat by my appearance. \n\n\n\nThe next morning, I received the email with my login info and I dialed into the line right away. It was about ten- thirty. I didn't expect there to be a whole lot of people calling before noon on a Tuesday, but I wasn't looking to connect immediately. I just wanted to see what it would be like when I called in. When dialing the 800 number, I was prompted by an automated recording to press one to login and so I did, entering my login number and pin. I was the asked to record a short greeting describing what I wanted to talk about and record my name so callers would know what to refer to me as and how to pronounce my name. I recorded something ambiguous, saying my name was \"Kali and I was just looking for some company.\" \n\n\n\nOnce I got passed the recording segment, the system would start to play greetings from callers that were on the line at that moment. They were recordings, just like what I had just recorded, but I only heard mostly men, which I think customers could determine which side they wanted to be placed in when calling as I did come across some allegedly transgender and bisexual callers that announced this in their recordings. I wasn't surprised at all that there were a lot of recordings that followed the old 'ASL' formula for their introduction. \n\n\n\n\"6'5\", crew cut brown hair, blue eyes, fit, I work out. 38 year old professional looking for hot young girls ready to play with daddy.\"\n\n\n\nThat was a tame example. There was much worse that I had heard when I called in, That was why I was thankful for the 'block caller' feature which allowed me to block a caller for that session or indefinitely and I wouldn't have to listen to their sick recordings anymore. The demographic from the line was mostly middle aged 'professionals', that is, men that claimed to be lawyers, real estate investors, stock brokers, and such. There would sometimes be recordings that just sounded like someone moaning or listening to porn in the background. Yes. Very cringe. Despite all this, I did manage to connect with some pretty cool people on the line and did find that not everyone was looking for a phone quickie on their lunch break, which made it worth my time. We had already been advised to avoid greetings that sounded like the caller was already 'on the edge' because of the per minute rate. You always wanted to find a caller you could either talk down or seduce over time, whether the ultimate ending involved an orgasm or a promise to find you if they called in again in the future.\n\n\nThe cool thing about the line was that I didn't have people calling me through a VOIP or something that masked and rerouted the call. Everyone was connected on the line by pressing a button. If you didn't want to be on the line anymore, you hung up. If you just didn't want to talk to someone and were stuck in a conversation with them, you could hit the asterisk button (star) and return to the main menu recording, so I was only available to receive connection requests when I wanted to be, never 'on call.'\n\n\n\nI found myself calling in frequently after I saw how it worked. This particular line had a new feature that I liked to use sometimes because it came with additional 'promotional' pay. This new feature didn't come up until a few months of me working on the line and I had come across it at random when calling in one night. The recording that asked for your login had asked if I wanted to \"continue to live chat\" or join a \"party room\", which was basically like a chat room on the phone. You would enter the chat room based on the recording that would play for its ID number and there would be up to five people in the chat talking together.  There were party rooms for all different kinds of topics and with all different types of people talking in them. You could join in on a party room as a listener if all the talker slots were filled, but if you did this you did not get paid for your 'lurking'. \n\n\n\nThere was one party room that I found myself dialing into every chance I got. I had made friends with some of the regulars there and they were always talking about crazy things, everything from conspiracy theories to what they thought about religion or politics. It was very open and non-judgmental. Nobody was ready to rip you a new one if you disagreed with them. Everyone was simply open to a new opinion or mindset. There wouldn't always be open talker slots for that room though, so sometimes I was forced to listen until one opened up and I was next in queue to fill it. A man named 'Zeke' had created the room and acted as a moderator for it, leading the discussion and keeping the civil, open atmosphere that I loved about it.\n\n\n\nOne night after I had been a regular to the party line and that room for a couple months, Zeke and I were the only ones on the line and it was about one thirty in the morning. Zeke had brought up the topic of ghosts and hauntings, telling me some paranormal experiences he had had. He didn't know that my solo work and main focus was based around the creation of customized and personalized ritual and divination tools, such as runes, carved crystals, and such. Once I told them this, he got really excited, as it turned out, his wife was a practicing Wiccan. We talked about her beliefs and practices for some time, but I'm not sure at what point we started down the road of discussing curses in lieu of hauntings and the occult. \n\n\n\n\"Did you know that these party rooms were actually a feature in this line years ago?\"\n\n\n\nHe said and that surprised me. The feature didn't open up to me until a month or two into my work on the line and the mods had to give me a special log in for the promotional pay rate to be applied. Zeke confessed a while back that he had been calling in since he was in highschool, so if anyone knew, it was him. \n\n\n\n\"Yeah, so, basically they put them out and they didn't catch on for many people. I guess people just really like the one on one connection, but there was one group that used them exclusively and they're part of the reason they shut it all down for a while,\"\n\n\n\nZeke explained. He had my interest and curiosity piqued. I was sitting there listening to him clothing my coffee mug until my knuckles turned white waiting to see what all happened. \n\n\n\n\"This group was one of the first dark web kidnapping rings. They would find their victims on the main line. Someone would listen to greetings and find a girl they thought would be good to go and they would tell her the pin to their chat room, 000343. I'm not sure the name of the room exactly. I tried to look for it when they came back online but I haven't found one that fits. They would somehow get these girls to blab their real names and locations. Who knows how. Someone would allegedly show up at their house and kidnap them right out of their beds to participate in some fucked up rich people games. The company that owns this line caught on I think before the FBI did and shut down chat rooms before they could be held liable,\"\n\n\n\n The story shocked me. It shocked me because I couldn't understand how they were able to find someone ready and willing to give out their personal information like that, but Zeke made it sound like the girls never had a choice, that the group would hypnotize them or something. Zeke could hear the anxiety in my voice when I asked questions and chuckled, telling me to calm down. \n\n\n\n\"This was like, twenty years ago. Nothing like that goes on here now, just perverts and weirdos, BUT, there's a rumor I've heard that one of the girls' ghosts haunts this line trying to lure an unsuspecting talker to take her place. They say her spirit is caught in the transmission signal, attached to the cellular wavelengths,\" \n\n\n\nThat didn't help my already overactive imagination. Once we got off the line that night, I crawled into bed with my boyfriend and I knew I wasn't going to be able to fall asleep. The adrenaline of an interesting subject was running through my veins. My mind was churning out scenarios that would easily become the plot of a nightmare in the future. As I laid there, staring up at the ceiling, my eyes following the shadows made by our little night light plugged into the wall, I thought I heard something like a vibration coming from where I plugged my phone in on my dresser. Every night before I logged into the chat line I would put my phone on 'do not disturb' before calling in so that notifications or random calls wouldn't cut me off or interfere. My phone shouldn't have been making any sound at all, not even a vibration, until nine o'clock in the morning. The more I ignored it, the louder and more annoying the sound became. Finally, I threw the blanket off of my body and swing my feet around to slide off the bed, padding quietly over to my phone. My boyfriend was snoring so loudly that there was no way that he heard my phone going off at all. When I looked at it, the screen was unlocked and I had a new text message from 'Unknown.'\n\n\n\nAs someone who enjoys horror movies and works with occult and supernatural themes, the second I saw the new message pop up my heart sank into the pit of my stomach like I had just dropped after being on the incline, hovering over the edge of the track of a rollercoaster. I hesitated. What if I ignored it? Would it go away? I knew it wouldn't. I knew I had to check. With a sigh, I opened the message and dropped my phone on the floor when I saw it. \n\n\n\nThe message was nothing but the number '343' typed into a wall of text in the message box. \n\n\n\nThe second my phone hit the ground, the touch screen cracked. I cursed the cheap laminate flooring under my breath. I had just gotten the phone in the mail after upgrading from my old one and hadn't even made the first payment yet. Filled with anger and fear, I decided I wasn't going to even try to go to sleep. I took my phone with its stupid cracked screen out into our living room and plopped down on the couch. The first thing I did was do a search on the number that sent me the message. \n\n\n\nAt first, nothing showed in the results. The matches that were pulled weren't accurate to the exact number, but, weirdly, when I scrolled through the results the website that I had been working for on their party line platform popped up. They had a list of VOIP numbers that talkers could call in if the main lines had too much traffic or wouldn't let them connect. The number that was listed under the 'unknown' ID tag was one of those VOIP numbers, which was weird. I knew that the line was established decades before the internet was a widespread thing. It was highly unlikely that those numbers had any kind of SMS / MMS capability, but I wasn't a technical genius or anything. Had one of them been hacked to pull off some kind of elaborate prank on the talkers? \n\n\n\nConfused, I then typed in '000343' into the search box. The first result was a zip code. Other results referenced everything from UPCs to HTML color codes. It then occurred to me. \n\n\n\nWhen I created my pin numbers, I often looked at my phone keypad and came up with a four letter or six letter word or name that would be my pin and that I could easily reference the numbers for on my cell phone or any number pad. I picked up my phone and switched to the keypad screen under the call application and looked at the numbers 3-4-3 to see what letters correspond to the numbers. On a piece of paper, I wrote all the letters that were associated with the number 3 - D, E, F. I then looked to see which letters were associated with the number 4 - G H I. The answer was right in front of my face. I didn't need to write out many anagrams to realize that '343' spelled out 'DIE.' \n\n\n\nThe uneasy feeling I had when I received the text message had grown and festered. It was nearing 3 AM and I didn't want to wake my boyfriend up, especially if I was just being silly. I had already told him about what I had been doing to earn extra cash and he was wary of it. I didn't want him to have any ammunition to talk me out of it entirely. I found the call in number for the chat line in my contacts and dialed in, signing in with my login and pin number. I went onto the party room line in search of Zeke's room, but it wasn't in the line up after listening to them all the way through. I sighed, returning to the main line to listen to greetings. I just wanted to take my mind off of whatever spooky nonsense was happening and maybe get some sleep at some point before the sun came up. \n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, there was no shortage of creeps and perverts on the line at that hour. I found myself skipping through the greetings faster and faster as I went deeper into the recordings. There were a shocking amount of people on for the night, but barely any of them sounded like people I wanted to talk to. I knew I had to be hearing the end of the live recordings when I skipped on and segued into another that sounded like the caller was having connection issues. I could hear something like white noise, high and low frequencies, the combination of which made me feel dizzy, especially wearing the noise cancellation headset I used when talking on the line. Despite my uneasiness and the headache-inducing sound of the frequencies, I couldn't bring myself to skip past the recording to move onto the next one. All I had to do was press the number '3' and the mind-melting, ear-raping, noise would be gone. I tried with all of my willpower to force my finger to hit that button, but it was frozen, stuck, just like I was stuck listening to it. \n\n\n\nThe noise seemed to go on and on without end even though the recording had to be under forty seconds per the platform's restrictions. Every muscle in my body was tense. It reminded me when I stupidly used a taser on myself as a kid just because I was curious as to what it felt like. In my mind's eye, I imagined that my heart would also tense up and stop beating. I could feel the sweat beading under my hairline, dripping down my forehead, blurting my eyes, and splashing onto the phone screen in my head. Whether it was my tired eyes or the cracked corner of the screen that was causing it, the display was going in and out, the backlight strobing with it. I could see colorful lines appear across the call timer and number display. My mouth was dry, but all I could do was gulp air as I tried desperately to end the call or even just remove my headset. I was willing to toss my phone in the garbage disposal if I had to at this point. If the noise continued, I thought my ear drums would burst. \n\n\n\nFinally, the noise seemed to cease entirely with a static 'whoosh'. After a pause of complete silence, an ethereal voice came through as a feminine whisper in both ears.\n\n\n\n\"Come to the Blue Room. The code is 000343.\"\n\n\n\nI knew I didn't have a choice. As soon as the message ended, my phone beeped as if I had hit a button on the screen and I was propelled to the main menu where I could only listen as the 'Party Room' option was selected from the menu and the titles and greetings played for each of the rooms that were live until that same voice declared that the live room 'The Blue Room ' was looking for players. I watched in horror as the number '1' was pressed on my keypad to join and then '000343' when prompted for the passcode. Once connected to the room, all I heard was the same noise that I heard on the greeting in the live greetings lobby. Trying to fight whatever had control over me was futile, I knew now. I could feel tears welling up in the corners of my tired eyes and streaming down my cheeks, wetting the phone screen, mixing with the sweat of my terror. I opened my mouth. I didn't want to, but I did. \n\n\n\nI could feel the words starting to form. I knew what I was going to say. In my mind, I prayed for someone to help me before I made a horrible mistake. I closed my eyes, my lips began to move. \n\n\n\n\"My name is…\"\n\n\n\n\"Babe? What are you doing up?\" \n\n\n\nMy boyfriend was standing in the hall that led out into the living room with his arms crossed around his chest and tucked under his armpits. His presence must have broken the possession or the spell that had been cast on me because when he got my attention, I was able to hit the 'End Call' button and take my headset off my head. I had no words to tell him what was about to happen and what had already happened. I was lucky that I wasn't compelled to do something much worse than what was about to happen and I can't imagine what would happen if I had given my personal information to whatever was on the other end of that line. \n\n\n\nAfter that night, I stopped calling in to the line that much, cutting my online time down to a couple days a week, if that, and finding other ways to make extra cash if we needed it rather than put in more time. I didn't tell Zeke or anyone about what had almost happened and I never called in at or after 3 AM anymore. \n\n\n\nIt would be several weeks before I caught a news story in passing about a raid on what was thought to be an abandoned factory just outside of the metropolitan area where I live that contained the bodies of several young women that had been missing since 1999. The FBI reported finding both wireless receivers and burner phones taped or tied to their hands along with sigils and occult symbols painted on the walls and tattooed or carved into the bodies of the girls. They never mentioned catching anyone they believed to be a suspect and none of the young women were recovered alive. \n\n\n\n Shortly thereafter, I received my last deposit from the chat line, along with an email claiming they weren't making enough money in the new 'digital era' to stay afloat financially and there was too much competition with similar, but free to try,  platforms. I don't know if the platform was directly involved in the strange operation that was uncovered at that site, but I'm certain that what the FBI uncovered would have linked them to it some how. I wish I could find out if the phones in the hands of the victims had an outgoing call history or if one had sent me that text I received that night. \n\n\n\nThis would be the first time I have told anyone about this experience and possibly the last. Zeke had said that this group that kidnapped the poor talkers that fell into their clutches were defunct, but I have reason to believe that they are still operating, using the anonymous nature of chat lines and whatever black magic they used to manipulate the frequencies of the party line that hypnotized people into giving them their personal details so that they could find them. \n\nOnce I stopped working for the party line, I didn't look for another similar job opportunity. I opened my shop back up to sell my crafts and never looked back. If anything, it justified my hatred of talking on the phone even more so.",

        "text": "Really, I can't explain what the hell just happened to me. Ever had it like, you get out of your house, and gradually you start understanding that something's *severely wrong* with the world around you?\n\nIt's better to tell the story from the beginning, though. So I just woke up normally, did my routine morning business, and headed out on my affairs. Well, I was about to have a date with my girl (let's call her Mandy for simplicity). We were supposed to meet at 12.30 PM, and as a man I definitely didn't want to be late, so I've left early enough to arrive some 10 to 15 minutes before schedule. I was also planning on getting a gift for her, so a small detour was planned just as well.\n\nThe moment I've left home, the strange things began.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, it was **cold** outside. Freakin' cold. It was barely above 50 degrees outside (10 Celsius, for you metric system guys). Nothing unusual, yeah, unless you live in Orlando. And there is basically no reason for weather to be this cold, but I was, \"fuck, whatever\", got back home, put on a warmer shirt and got out. There was another thing that bugged me, I didn't notice it though until some time after my supposed date... \n\nWell, so the next strange thing I've bumped into is Mr. Cocksploosh. He's my neighbor, and an old fart with a particularly nasty personality. So just as usual, I threw him a quick \"G'day Mr. Sploosh\" and walked away. I half-expected to hear his ramblings 'bout how dare I miss the \"cock\" part of his last name *(The old fart is*  ***very*** *upset when somebody calls him 'Sploosh)* and how insolent and ill-mannered we the young people are these days. But. The old fart had a sudden burst of friendliness of warmth so uncharacteristic of him! *\"Oh g'day Randy! I see you're in good spirits today, is that because you're going to meet that girl of yours, Mandy or what's her name? Ha-ha!*\" - that's roughly what he said to me. With a warm smile, so unbecoming of him.\n\nIt looked more creepy than wholesome to me, though. The dude who is always grumpy and aloof - the old dude who never appreciates anything - and he's now like this? The fuck? I quickly replied something, just to get the dude off me (sorry, the good version of Cocksploosh, but I was really creeped), and went to the store to get my girl a present.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was that thing at the store, where I simply couldn't find her favorite chocolate sweets. Heart-shaped chocolate sweets with vanilla cream filling, packed into a big, red, heart-shaped box wrapped in silk. These stand out just well among other sweets, so I'm pretty sure I didn't just &lt;i&gt;miss&lt;/i&gt; them, especially after looking around the store a few times, thinking they have some sorta re-arrangement or something. Well, I ended up buying a different set of sweets, in a bigger box and in an assortment. \"Hope she'll like them\" I thought.\n\nWell, with all this and that, I've finally arrived to the place of our meeting some two minutes before the right time. \"Phew. Not late.\" thought I as I sat down on a bench, waiting for her.\n\nMandy didn't arrive after five minutes. Ten minutes later she isn't here. Thirty minutes... not here. *\"Okay, I'll call her\"*... no answer. ***\"Now, what the fuck?\"*** thought I as my third attempt to call Mandy turned out to be a total failure.\n\nI've waited for her for another hour, made sure my clock isn't playing pranks on me, and after a hour and a bit more, I was, like, \"really, Mandy... fuck you\". Then I went home. As for the chocolate sweets, I was already going to eat them in peace, alone. **FUCK YOU, MANDY.**\n\nAnd that's it. I went to the store, to get myself some beer, also bought myself some fast food chicken. At least my favorite beer was still in place. Somewhat cheered up, I went back home.\n\nThat's where the **really** weird shit kicked in. I finally came to my district, but for some reason I just couldn't find my home! No, here's the Splooge's house, there is my another neighbor, a single mom with three kids all from different fathers. My house was right in the middle! What the fuck...\n\nOkay, but I do surely remember leaving my house today, from *this* neighborhood. So maybe I should take a look around, maybe my consciousness is playing some tricks and my house isn't actually between those two *(though dude, it's been more than five years since I've moved in, what the actual fuck is happening?)* Oh well, I've found a house which looks just like mine right behind the single mom's house. Try to open it with my keys. The door opens alright.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhew. *What the fuck is happening?..* These were roughly my thoughts. And right before I've opened the chocolate box, a thought flashed across my mind, \"well, maybe Mandy's got in serious trouble, and I'm being an asshole and thinking she decided to just ignore the date\". So I tried calling her. No response, again. It's a fuckin' shame I don't know the number of her mother or father or any relative.\n\n\"Facebook. Might wanna check her Facebook.\" Holy shit! How come that thought didn't hit me. That's right, an absence of activities from her on Facebook would likely hint that she's indeed in a trouble! So I'm trying to load my page and... \n\n\"Site not found\". Not even some sort of \"Site down, check back later\" page. The browser telling me that it can't find the site at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, a quick web search if the website is down... And ***none of the search results are even closely relevant to the Facebook!*** I mean, not even the word is known to the search engine. The search results are all made of some pages containing the words \"face\" and \"book\", but no mention of the social media network itself. At all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, dude. Come fuckin' on. What the hell could theoretically happen to Facebook so it got erased from ***all the internet?!*** Some super evil carnival plot of some party interested in taking down one of the larger social media networks? Regardless, Mandy isn't answering my calls, her Facebook page is gone - assuming she HAD one, now that I think about it, and no way to figure out WTF is happening...\n\n...actually, there is. Jerry! Some time have passed before I've remembered about his existence. He's a good friend of both me and Mandy. Perhaps he's more aware?.. I've no idea how to contact him via internet, so I call him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe phone rang for about thirty seconds before Jerry answered my call. And when he finally took the phone, the first thing I've heard from him was-\n\n*\"Dude, are you an idiot?!\"*\n\nRight as he answered the phone. And I was like--\n\n*\"umm, hello Jerry?\"*\n\n*J: \"Dude, are you a fucking idiot?! Not only you're calling me like that, but you seem to be calling from your house?\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\"Umm, Jerry, are you alright?\"*\n\n*J: \"That 's what I would like to ask you! Did you forget you're being hunted? It's been almost a week since Mandy have declared you an asshole!\"*\n\nNow, wait a minute. What the fuck is that bit about being hunted and declaring me an asshole... and we were, like, chatting on Facebook literally yesterday like usual! So I ask:\n\n*\"Jerry. Now can you elaborate on what the fuck are you talking about?\"*\n\n*J: \"What do you mean? Randy, your girl have declared you an asshole, per your dating contract, when you've ditched your fourth date with her. In a row. She decided enough is enough, so next Monday, she went to the DMB and declared you an asshole. Which means, you're now eligible to be hunted by anyone who's hungry for blood!\"*\n\nDude. What. The. Fuck?\n\n*J: \"Look, dude, you're in some real shit now. That was a stupid contract you've made with her, so you better move somewhere real far away, create yourself a new identity, forget all of your old friends and start a new life somewhere... you hear me, dude? Randy?\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJerry called for me a few times from the phone before I ended the call. What the fuck was that shit he just said?.. Something about a dating contract, and hunting... And what the hell is DMB? I was confused as heck, so I was just sitting there for some time. Really, what the hell should I do now, I've had no idea.\n\nAt some point, I took a look at my window, the part which wasn't closed off with the curtain. The sky outside was whitish-green. Unlike the aquamarin-ish hue which was during the day, when I was out. That's the thing I've noticed earlier in the morning today, but didn't give it much attention earlier. The sky was giving off an aquamarin-ish hue instead of the usual light blue, but it wasn't way too different from the usual, so I didn't pay much attention to it at first. And now it was green.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, and you know what did I do next? I just stood wherever the fuck I was. At my home. Well it might be not the wisest option, but what should have I done in this kind of situation, really? The closest options were *\"run outside in panic\"*, and *\"run outside and keep running in a single direction, not knowing where or why\",* and *\"cry like a little bitch and do nothing useful to resolve the situation\"* and *\"stay here for a while and think of what to do\"*. I chose the latter because, hey, I didn't feel like running around in panic when it's so freakin' **COLD.**\n\nSo, the sun started setting down after some time. You know what did it look like? The sky became even greener at first, then switched to orange hues, and finally, when the sun was already below the horizon, it turned crimson-red before darkening completely. RIGHT after the sky became charcoal black, I've realized I could've snapped so much pictures of that! But I didn't because I was all pre-occupied with the \"WTF is going on\" around me. Fuck.\n\nThe \"transition\" back to the normal, known world was just as sudden as me getting into the Unknown Place where I was allegedly hunted for sport for missing out four dates with Mandy (while I haven't even missed out one of them in the real world). I was just sitting, fiddling with my phone since there wasn't anything to do, when the phone rang. \"Mandy\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor several seconds I was even thinking whether to pick up the phone or not. I finally did.\n\n*\"Um... Hello?\"*\n\n*M: \"Randy, are you ok? I've tried to reach you today for, maybe, fourteen times already!\"*\n\n*\"Wait, didn't you declare me an asshole a...\"* Wait. This Mandy was trying to reach me fourteen times? That means...\n\n*M: \"Umm... Asshole? What do you mean, Randy? I didn't call you any mean names! What's going on?\"*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo. This means I'm back in the normal world, right? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, Mandy was mighty pissed at me for missing her out. I couldn't really explain jack shit to her since my tale would sound outrageously insane. C'mon, just how often do you get lost in a foreign world with no clues as for what the fucked is going on around? And the only evidence of me being in another world is that box of sweets. I've looked up anything like this in our shops and found nothing similar.\n\nSo... It all happened yesterday, Mandy is pissed at me for missing our date, and honestly I've got no idea how to explain what TF happened... because I've barely got any idea as for what happened. And yes, today is a warm, sunny day. The sky is blue again and my house is right between Sploosh's place and the single mom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe I should think of moving somewhere else again...",

        "text": "People sometimes ask me if I've ever had any paranormal experiences, and I used to always laugh it off, telling them I haven't. I've never had any black eyed children knocking on my door asking to be let in, I've never seen strange lights in the sky that move too fast to be planes, and I certainly have never had a spirit board put me in contact with the souls of the long-dead.\n\nHowever, a few days ago I was visiting with my mother, and she reminded me of something very odd, something I had seemingly buried deep within my subconscious mind.\n\nWe were discussing my childhood, when out of nowhere, she remarked \"I'm sorry we never let you go back to Jungle Land, I remember you used to have so much fun there, but, well, I just got so scared after that time you fell asleep in the tube maze that I could never bear to bring you back there again.\"\n\nI was confused, not even remembering what she was talking about, and I asked her what Jungle Land was. She held up a finger, as if to say \"one moment\", and then shuffled off to her bedroom, arriving a minute later with a photo album. She flipped through the pages, scanning each one, before stopping and pointing at a specific picture.  \n\nI looked over and saw myself as a young girl, perhaps five or six years old, smiling happily as I stood in front of a large indoor plastic play structure, constructed of multicolored interconnected tubes. I felt sick as I stared at the photo for reasons I couldn't fully fathom, and the room suddenly felt much colder.\n\nI thanked my mother for the opportunity to spend some time with her and hastily made up some excuse to leave and walk back to my apartment. By the time I had slammed shut and locked the door after I got home, I had fully remembered the terrifying events that occurred so long ago.\n\n\\- - -\n\nJungle Land was a large family entertainment center in my home town, with an indoor jungle gym, ball pit, arcade games, and, of course, a tube maze. I think they were planning to make it a chain, but as far as I know there was only ever the one location, I suppose it just wasn't profitable enough to expand from there.\n\nI recalled that the incident occurred when I wasn't much older than I had been in the photo my mother showed me, maybe eight at the most. It was a weekend my mother had free, so she took me over to Jungle Land to play with some friends. Unfortunately none of the friends made it, so I was instead I had to try my luck with the other children, all of whom were strangers to me.\n\nI wasn't a particularly outgoing child, and tended towards shyness and reclusion unless around my friends, so I was understandably frustrated by the whole situation. As I waded in the ball pit despondently, kicking around the multicolored balls in petulant annoyance, I suddenly heard a voice whisper to me from the direction of the tube maze.\n\n\"Hey! What's your name?\"  \n \n\nI turned to look at who had spoken, and saw a young boy, about my age, peeking his head out of the entrance to the maze. He was smiling at me.\n\n\"Samantha. What's yours?\" I asked, cautiously, not used to talking with other kids who I didn't already know.\n\n\"My name is Charlie! Nice to meet you\" I heard him say. But, though I could tell that it was the boy's voice, I didn't see his lips move at all.  \n\nI giggled, and asked \"Hey, your mouth didn't move, that's cool! How did you do that?\"\n\nI heard the boy's voice again, saying \"It's a magic trick! If you want, I can teach you how, but you have to follow me.\" He gestured for me to follow him into the tube maze. Excited to have a new friend and learn the magic trick, I eagerly followed him, quickly forgetting the sadness I felt only moments before. Childhood moods pass quickly I suppose.\n\nI followed close behind my newfound friend at first, but as he continued climbing and crawling his way through the maze I found myself falling behind. I've never been a particularly athletic person, and even as a young girl this still held true.  \n\nThe winding plastic tubes seemed to go on forever, with endless twists and turns. The smell of plastic was thick in the stale air, and I felt a little but claustrophobic. Despite how busy the place seemed only minutes before, we didn't come across any other children as I followed Charlie deeper into the maze. After maybe fifteen minutes I started to feel uneasy.\n\n\"Are we almost there?\" I asked, a slightly whiny tone in my voice.\n\n\"Almost there, I promise! Just one more turn\" responded Charlie, cheerfully. He was about twelve feet ahead of me, down a long tube that took a sharp left turn at the end.\n\nAs he rounded the corner, and I lost sight of him, I became uncomfortably aware of how quiet everything was. Even without any other children in sight, I should have been able to hear laughter, the sounds of the arcade, and the crying of little kids in the distance. But there was nothing, just my own breathing echoing in the cramped plastic tunnel. Something deep inside told me I needed to turn around and get out as fast as possible.\n\nI rotated as fast as I could in the cramped space, and began steadily crawling my way back as quickly as I could, which wasn't particularly fast. My knees had begun to hurt from the continuous scraping against plastic, and my arms and legs were both sore from exertion. Despite the labyrinthine nature of the tube maze, I somehow seemed to know which way I had to go to get out. I'm very lucky to have a good sense of direction, even from a very young age.\n\nI started to hear sounds of other children in the distance, and I managed to find my second wind, quickening my pace out of a desire to get out of this tangle of plastic tubes as swiftly as possible. I heard something crawling quickly far behind me, and I felt an intense urge to turn around and see who my pursuer was, but I was worried that if I did so something horrible would happen to me.\n\nThe sound of crawling from behind me came closer and closer, and I began to cry a little from fear and tiredness. Finally, I saw the exit, and with a last burst of energy, managed to stumble out into the play area near the ball pit. To my exhausted lungs, the air conditioning felt like a mountain breeze. I looked back at the tube maze, but nothing had come out after me. I felt safe once again, and started to calm down, my sniffling tears slowing down to just grateful breaths of fresh air.\n\nI noticed that all the other children were sulkily heading towards the exit, accompanied by their parents, and that the outside windows showed a red sky. As I pondered this, I heard my mother shout \"Samantha! Oh my God where were you?\"\n\nI looked up to find my mother running towards me, before she scooped me up into her arms in a great big hug, kissing me on the top of my head. I was quite confused, not knowing why she was so worried, nor why it seemed to be closing time when I'd only been in the maze for thirty minutes at most.\n\n\"You've been gone for hours sweetheart, what happened?\" she asked, visibly teary eyed.\n\n\"I was in the tube maze with Charlie, but I got scared. He was going to show me how to talk without using my mouth\" I replied, simply.\n\n\"She must have fallen asleep in there\", said a bored looking Jungle Land employee who I hadn't noticed earlier, \"good timing too, it's time for y'all to get going, we have to clean the ball pit.\"\n\nWith that, my mother grabbed my shoes from the cubby and carried me out to the car, continuing to ask me questions about if I was alright, seemingly more for her own comfort than mine. I wasn't paying attention though, I was just focusing on the tube maze. Out one of the rounded, convex plastic windows, I could see the angry, frowning face of Charlie. I had never seen such genuine hate in anyone's eyes before, nor have I since. I felt myself start to cry again as my mother patted me gently, reassuring me that everything was alright.\n\n\\- - -\n\nAfter vividly remembering all that occurred, I suddenly snapped back to reality, realizing I was breathing heavily from stress. I started to calm down a little bit, telling myself that it all must have been some nightmare I experienced as a young child. I must have just fallen asleep in the tube maze and made up the whole thing in my mind.\n\nOut of curiosity, I looked up Jungle Land on the internet, expecting to learn it had gone out of business during the pandemic or had been demolished to make way for an apartment building. Instead, I found something very disturbing.\n\nThe first search result I found was a news article about Jungle Land shutting down, dated about fifteen years ago, shortly after my incident with Charlie. The whole center went out of business following a huge scandal, parents just didn't feel comfortable bringing their kids there anymore after the news broke out.\n\nApparently three children went missing after visiting the establishment, with no trace of where they could have gone. Their parents insist they last saw them entering the tube maze.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11ejcfx/the_country_club_i_work_at_has_some_strange/",
        "text": "There lies an enormous country club in the forest near the Maine and Vermont border. 220 acres of beautiful lush forest containing several buildings, an entire 18-hole golf course, a hunting range, and even an indoor and outdoor movie theater. The club is named Saint-Mihel and I have both the great honor and great misfortune of working there. \n\nMy name is Theodore Fairfax, Ted for short, and I began working at Saint-Mihel several months ago. I started out as a simple valet and was soon promoted to working as a glorified servant for the rich assholes who frequent the club. Whether it’s following them around as they practice their golf swings and acting as their caddie, or following them around when they hunt out in the forest for pheasants and the odd deer. Sometimes I’m even forced to wash their cars. \n\nLet’s just say, acting as their glorified butler isn’t exactly what I signed up for when I decided to work here. Made much worse by the fact that all these rich assholes barely tip me anything. The most I’ve ever gotten in tips was five dollars, and that was after I went swimming in the golf course pond to get a ball that had fallen in there so my client wouldn’t ruin his game. Getting attacked by geese and turtles and all I got was a fiver. \n\nI was seriously considering just quitting and working at a Wendy’s or something, if it hadn’t been for one particularly interesting shift that really made me rethink if I wanted to leave or not. The day had started off like any other, me taking an uber to work and getting out in time to see my boss, Gerald, absolutely losing his shit with everyone around him. Now that was normal for the most part, Gerald is an asshole after all, but this time it felt very different. Normally he has a calm demeanor, one that makes you think that he’s actually enjoying being the giant asshole that he usually is. But this time he was in a full-blown panic. \n\n“Fairfax! You lazy asshole, get over here!” He ordered me just as I fished a cigarette out of my pocket. I held back what I wanted to say to him and simply walked over to him as he continued to bark orders in a seemingly blind and angry panic. “Listen you deadbeat, I need you to be on your best behavior. The owner is coming with his party and god help you if you somehow piss him off!” he shouted at me, going a million miles an hour with each word. \n\n“Sinclair? He never comes here though. He’s always too busy with his rehab center.” I of course had heard of Constantine Sinclair. You couldn’t call yourself a New Englander if you hadn’t heard of him and his Sombra Rehab Center. I’ll admit that I had no idea this was his country club until a good three months into working here. But you’d be forgiven for not knowing since he never seems to visit this place. \n\n“Well, he’s coming now. So get the lead out and start doing something!” Gerald shouted at me, his pudgy face bright red with anger and sweat. I couldn’t help but give him a cheeky smile as I held up the cigarette I still had between my fingers. \n\n“I’m taking my smoke break,” I told him. I could tell he wanted to tear me limb from limb, but I also knew that he needed me. “I’ll just smoke this and then do whatever it is you want me to do.” I told him as I placed the tobacco stick in my mouth and fished around in my pocket for my bic. \n\n“You better smoke that thing fast. Or I’ll kick your ass so hard, your nose will bleed.” Gerald spat at me, turning to enter the lobby and return to his endless shouting. I couldn’t help but give a silent laugh at him as I fished out my bic lighter and was finally able to light my cigarette. Taking a few puffs from it, I leaned against the wall as I enjoyed my last few moments of freedom. \n\nThen suddenly, I heard faint music. Real quiet at first but then it slowly started to build. Coinciding with a car I saw coming up the driveway at blazing-fast speeds. My jaw nearly hit the fucking floor when I saw the model of the car. 1957 Chevy Bel Air convertible. My fucking dream car, and even in the same beautiful green body I wanted it in. The cigarette fell out of my mouth as I watched the car speeding towards me. Finally, the music was within earshot of me and able to be deceived. And it was Starman by David Bowie, playing at full volume as the car came to the roundabout and came to a final halt right in front of me. \n\n“Hey, do I park here? Or do you take my keys and park somewhere for me?” the man in the seat of my dream car asked as he turned down the music enough to be able to comprehend him. And yet my eyes and mind were clearly glued to the car that I had wanted all my life. \n\n“Wha-” Was the only word I managed to barf out as I finally peeled my eyes off the car to look at the driver. It wasn’t Sinclair, it was a younger man, with messy brown hair, glasses, and the most gorgeous eyes I had ever seen on a man. “A-a-are you…a member?” I finally managed to spit out. \n\n“No, but I’ve got an invitation from Constantine.” The mystery man told me as he fished into his doctor’s coat and pulled out an envelope. I crushed the cigarette that had fallen out of my mouth with my foot and cautiously approached the convertible. Taking the slip of paper I looked it over. Not exactly knowing what to do with it and nodding. “You guys have a place to change? I came straight from work and I’d rather not have him see me in my scrubs.” He told me with a silky smooth voice. \n\n“Uhm, yes sir.” I nodded. Now unable to tear my eyes off of this man. “Can I uh…get your name? F-for the registry?” I asked him. I did technically need to do that, but I really just wanted to know who this guy was. \n\n“Oh sure!” he said with a loud laugh, turning his car off and smiling at me. “Dr. James Harrison at your service!” He looked around still wondering what he was supposed to do with his car. I had never heard of him, but I was definitely going to look him up after all this. \n\n“You can leave your car here, sir. The changing rooms are through the main lobby and directly left.” I told him as I reached down and opened the door for him to step out. It was only when he did so that I noticed his entire lower half was covered in blood. I paused for a second as we both met eyes and then both looked down at his bloodstained articles of clothing. \n\n“Sorry about this. I just came from surgery. I thought I was running late so I didn’t even bother to change! But it seems like I’m actually the first one here.” He told me with a smile, and I couldn’t help but agree with the fact that it sounded completely logical. \n\n“Just…try not to get it on the floor. My manager would freak out.” I told him, to which he nodded and gave me a soft shoulder punch as he walked past me. I softly rubbed my shoulder where he had hit me and felt a hot rush come upon my face. \n\n“He’s way out of your league, son.” A mysterious southern voice told me. I shouted out loud and stepped back to see who the hell it was that was talking to me within earshot. And I let out an even louder shout when I saw the pale-skinned, buttoned-eyed creature that had somehow gotten so close to me undetected. Losing my footing I fell flat on my ass as I stared up at the freakishly tall man. “Oh! I do apologize, Ted. Didn’t mean to frighten you as much as I did.” The mystery southern man told me as he reached a gloved hand down to me. \n\nI took it and was lifted up with relative ease up onto my feet. Stepping back, I took in the view of this new visitor. Taller than me, with a suit, top hat, and even a cane. He looked like something right out of a silent movie. Nosferatu or some shit. \n\n“I take it…you’re also Mr. Sinclair’s guest?” He gave a nod and it was then that I noticed the number of stitches this man had on his body. His mouth was stitched up, his head was connected to his neck by stitches, and he had buttons for eyes. It was feeling more and more like he was some creature straight from my nightmares. \n\n“King Creole, at your service.” He took his top hat off and bowed down before me. “I’d show you my invitation but I’m sure Gerald will remember me.” He chuckled, looking over towards the entrance of the estate and looking back at me. “If you’re looking at quitting,” he said, flicking his fingers and producing a business card out of thin air. “I’m always hiring,” he said with a slight cackle as he walked away, the tapping of his cane against the stone steps like some sort of ominous clock. \n\nLooking down at the business card I raised a brow at it. ‘O’l King Creole’s Half Priced Voodoo Store’. Thinking nothing about it, I shoved it into my pocket and looked around to see if there were going to be any other wild creatures that were going to appear out of thin air and scare the shit out of me. I was sort of right when a limousine suddenly appeared on the horizon. Preparing myself this time I stood up straight and waited for the long black car to approach. \n\n“Do you guys have a buffet here?” a new, unknown voice asked me, causing me to yelp out in surprise and once again end up flat on my ass. “Is that a yes or no?” this unknown voice asked me. Looking up I was met with the most confusing person I had ever laid eyes upon. He was wearing a tailcoat and that alone looked like it qualified him to be a member here. But then upon close inspection of him, I was more confused than I was afraid. A large scar ran down his face, his hair was long and white with only the very ends being black, and his eyes looked like what an acid trip would look like. \n\n“Uhm. We have a kitchen that will cook you anything you want, sir.” I told him as I got off the floor and brushed myself down from the dirt and pebbles that had found their way onto my body. He seemed to ponder over this and offered me a simple shrug. \n\n“I’ll hold them to that,” he said cryptically and started to walk past me. I was about to ask him if he was even supposed to be here, but after seeing King Creole I was pretty sure he was meant to be here. “Oh, one more thing,” he suddenly said, causing me to turn back around to look at him. My eyes immediately were drawn to something catching the sun’s rays on his lapel. There was a golden pin of a praying mantis staring back at me. “You people have a golf course here, yes?” \n\n“Uh, yes sir.” I told him as I squinted to avoid the shine coming off the pin he was wearing. A wide smile stretched across his face as he turned around all giddy with excitement. “Creole! You’re going down this time!” he shouted as he sprinted up the stairs towards the entrance. \n\n“Keep dreaming, Antonio!” Came the shout in response. I didn’t have much time to think about anything before the limousine pulled up and stopped just behind Harrison’s convertible. Walking down to the door I opened it and was immediately met with an umbrella shoved into my face. \n\n“You must be new here.” An annoyed voice told me as I backed up from the umbrella. I was confused as to who would bring an umbrella on such a nice day like this but that thought quickly went out the window when I saw who was holding the umbrella. \n\n“M-Mr. Sinclair! Uhm, yes. I only started working here three months ago.” I told him as I took a hold of his umbrella and quickly covered his blonde head from the rays of the sun. He didn’t really seem to acknowledge anything I had just said, but I was mostly used to that when it came to the rich assholes who frequented his country club. \n\n“I assume the others have all arrived?” he finally asked me once he was completely out of the limousine. I nodded and he nodded back at me. “I’d ask you to help with my final guest, but I’m sure Gerald can handle him.” Sinclair told me as he motioned for me to start walking. I nodded and walked along with him, holding his umbrella up high as we entered the lobby. \n\nGerald came running over to us and was clearly doing his best not to tear me a new one as he saw that I had already gotten to Mr. Sinclair. “Mr. Sinclair! It’s so good to see you back here!” Gerald said as he entered full-blown ass kiss mode. \n\n“Tone it down, Gerald. I’m not here because I want to be here. I’m only here because these assholes want to be here.” Sinclair sighed, reaching into his coat pocket and pulling out a cigar from it. He handed it to me and I stared at it for a moment wondering what he wanted me to do. Apparently, he didn’t want me to do anything to it as all of a sudden the smell of burning tobacco entered my nostrils and I looked down to see that somehow the cigar had been lit. \n\n“Constantine!” Came an excited familiar voice. Turning to see who it was I felt my face go red when I saw that it was Dr. Harrison. He was dressed now in a suit like all the others had been and it made him look even more spectacular. \n\n“Ah, James. I see you made it. Oh, that reminds me. Gerald, go and help Monsieur LeBlanc out of my limo.” I looked at Gerald and saw his face lose all color. He swallowed a lump in his throat and began to nervously fidget with his hands. \n\n“L-LeBlanc is here?” He asked for confirmation. To which Sinclair nodded and shooed him away as he started walking, with me and Dr. Harrison in toe as I still held the umbrella over his head. He hadn’t told me to stop and he hadn’t made known his displeasure in my doing it, so I just kept on doing it. \n\n“Your father built a lovely estate, Constantine,” Dr. Harrison said after a moment of silence between the three of us. Sinclair scoffed at the mention of his father, leading us over to a large portrait that hung from the wall of the main lobby. The imposing figure staring back down at the three of us was quite portly and had a big thick mustache. Below the portrait was an inscription that read, ‘Cornelius Augustus Sinclair 1862-1919’. \n\n“He spent more time here than he did with me.” Sinclair tsked angrily and spun on his heels away from the portrait. I couldn’t help but continue looking at the inscription and wonder if it was correct. Those birth and death dates didn’t make much sense in my head. But before I could question that oddity, another quickly entered my focus when I suddenly heard one of the female staffers let out a loud shriek. \n\n“We probably shouldn’t have brought him,” Dr. Harrion said with a sigh as we looked toward the entrance of the lobby to see a wheelchaired person biting the arm of one of the girls on the staff. The silver-masked person in the chair had a seeming death grip on her as she screamed aloud and begged him to let her go. \n\n“I wanted to leave him. But if we’re all here, he has to be here as well. Those are the rules.” Sinclair sighed as he took a big long puff from his cigar. Letting out a long puff of smoke he looked me in the eyes and I could see how tired his eyes looked. Heavily bagged and seemingly old beyond his somewhat youthful appearance. “Well if I must be here, we might as well go bird shooting,” he finally said to me, breaking the little staring contest we had going on. “Gerald!” he shouted out. \n\nGerald, who at that moment was trying to pry, who I was guessing was LeBlanc, off of the poor girl. He looked over at us and then to LeBlanc before letting go of him and rushing over to us, that kiss-ass look back on his face. \n\n“Fetch me my shotgun. I’m going bird shooting.” Sinclair told him the simple order before shooing him away. Gerald looked at me and truly seemed like he wanted to strangle me for getting such an easy job. But he dutifully bowed and quickly scurried off to go and fetch the owner his shotgun. \n\n“I’ve never been bird shooting,” Dr. Harrison said as we started off toward the rear of the lobby that led to the forest where hunting was permitted. As we exited into the sunny outdoors, we were very nearly run over by a speeding golf cart. Thinking on instinct, I quickly grabbed Sinclair’s arm and yanked him back as the cart went speeding past us. \n\n“Sorry, Sinclair! We’re taking this baby out for a spin!” Came Antonio’s cackling voice as he sped around in circles. Sinclair looked like he was about to snap someone’s neck and as he looked down at my hand wrapped around his arm; I quickly let him go and held my hand up defensively. \n\n“Creole! Why did you let that moron drive a golf cart!” Sinclair shouted loudly and pointed at the cart as it did donuts, tearing up the grass. I was confused at first before I noticed that indeed the cart had two occupants. \n\n“He said he wanted to drive! Can’t exactly turn him down when he said please!” Creole’s southern voice came from the spinning golf cart as it sped away after finally finishing its donuts. I could practically see the steam bellowing from Sinclair and I wanted to run as far away as possible. But I was stuck holding his umbrella so I was glued to him. \n\n“Thank you,” he finally said after a moment of calming down. I didn’t know he was talking to me until I could see that he was holding his hand out toward me. I quickly took it and shook it, smiling a little and trying to play it off. “Theodore Fairfax, huh?” He read my nametag and looked me over for a few more seconds. “An interesting name.” \n\n“My parents are fond of old-sounding names,” I said with an awkward laugh. Sinclair nodded and went back to looking out at the forest. Suddenly loud panting came from behind us and I saw Gerald holding an ornate shotgun and a few boxes of shells in his arms. \n\n“Y-your shotgun, sir,” he said through wheezing breaths. Dr. Harrison came forth and took the objects from the wheezing manager and held onto them, starting to load the double-barreled shotgun.  “S-sir? Could you please do something about Monsieur LeBlanc? H-he’s starting to rip that poor girl to pieces.” I could feel my stomach drop when I heard that, but Sinclair seemed to care little for what was going on inside. \n\n“Not my problem. Just make sure he doesn’t try to mate with any of my employees. The last thing I need right now is to deal with that mess. Come on you two, before anything else annoying happens to us.” He told me and Harrison as he started to walk toward the forest. I followed him quickly and Dr. Harrison soon after, leaving Gerald there to deal with whatever horrible thing was going on inside the lobby. \n\n“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you use a gun before, sir,” Dr. Harrison said as we began to walk through the tall trees. “After everything you’ve been through, I just thought you wouldn’t really enjoy doing this.” \n\n“Shooting some birds isn’t serving on the western front, James,” Sinclair said simply, letting the conversation die there. We were silent for a handful of minutes before finally Sinclair broke the silence with a question to me. “You can keep what you’ve seen here secret, right Theodore?” \n\n“O-of course, sir.” I told him, having to remember what my full name was. Sinclair nodded and led out into a clearing that was surrounded by trees on all sides and was a perfect place for a picnic; or in our case, some bird hunting. Dr. Harrison handed the shotgun over to Sinclair and we all waited in silence. The sounds of the forest were relaxing after the chaos that had just happened back at the lobby. \n\nSuddenly a couple of pheasants leaped out from the tall grass and started making a run for the sky. Sinclair calmly leveled his shotgun and let loose both barrels. Three birds fell back down to the ground and Sinclair handed the firearm back to Harrison for reloading. \n\n“Great shot, sir.” I told him, actually impressed that he’d managed to shoot and hit them in such a short time. \n\n“Thank you Theodore,” he said simply, motioning for the gun from Dr. Harrison as several more pheasants began to make a run for the sky after the loud bangs of the first volley. The good doctor got the gun reloaded and quickly handed it back to Sinclair who proceeded to unload both barrels in quick succession. Two more pheasants fell back to Earth as the others began to scatter in multiple directions. \n\n“Very well done indeed, sir!” Dr. Harrison said with excitement as he was handed the gun again. He began to load another round in when a loud distant explosion caused all of us to look back toward the lobby. \n\n“What did those idiots do this time?” Sinclair groaned as he simply turned back around. “Well, what are you waiting for? Go get them.” I thought he was talking to me, and I contemplated how exactly he wanted me to do that. But before I could verbalize my confusion, a sudden pungent smell of rot and decay overwhelmed me and forced a gag up from my stomach. Looking at Sinclair I was stunned to see a humanoid creature staring back at him with all five pheasants in his arms. It was dripping in black sludge but I could tell that it was sort of human-shaped with a head and neck. \n\n“Attention all Saint-Mihel employees! We have a Code Green! I repeat a Code Green!” Gerald’s voice shouted over the loudspeakers of the resort. I stared back in confusion at the trio, I had no idea what a code green was. But seemingly Dr. Harrison and Sinclair knew perfectly what it was. \n\n“What do you think upset him this time? Losing to Creole?” the doctor said as he took the shells he had loaded into the gun out and back into their box. “Or complaining about the food again?” he asked. \n\n“Whatever the reason, this is the last time I allow him to set foot on her.” Sinclair hissed, shoving the group of dead pheasants into my arms and yanking the umbrella away from me. He started walking back into the forest and all I and Dr. Harrison could do was follow him as quickly as we could with all our items. \n\n“Sir!” Gerald panted upon seeing us exiting the forest. “It’s Garibaldi! He’s destroying the golf course!” Sinclair sighed and rubbed his eyes, finally having finished his cigar he let it drop from his mouth and I watched as the creature emerged from the shadow he cast on the floor and squashed it with his hand. \n\n“Any particular reason?” he asked Gerald, clearly done with this whole day. \n\n“I believe he was expecting a mini-golf course,” King Creole said in his southern sing-songy voice. The top hat-wearing creature walked over to us, covered head to toe in grass, dirt, and blood. “I believe he did not take kindly to the rules of golf either,” The buttoned-eyed man said with a simple shrug. \n\n“Oh for God’s sake.” Sinclair groaned, planting his face into his hands and letting out a loud and audible grunt. “How long will it take him to calm down?” he asked Creole, only receiving a simple shrug. \n\n“Maybe by the time he gets to the ninth hole?” Was all he said as he started up the stairs to the main lobby, whistling all the way through his stitched-up mouth. Sinclair groaned some more before shaking his head and starting up after him. I stood there with Dr. Harrison and the pheasants, unsure if I was supposed to follow after him. \n\n“I think he’s calling it a day,” Dr. Harrison said as he handed the gun off to Gerald and followed after the disgruntled rehab operator. Gerald and I stared at each other for a moment before I also dumped the pheasants on him and raced after the duo, managing to escape my manager before he could formulate his yelling words. \n\n“Theodore,” Sinclair’s voice called me over once I had entered the lobby. He was again standing before the portrait of his father, and I quickly stepped over to him. He was holding another cigar and I watched as that creature emerged from the wall this time and lit a match for him. “You’ve been quiet and discreet for the whole day. I enjoy that in an employee.” He told me with a puff from his cigar. \n\n“Uhm, thank you, sir.” I told him as I looked up at the portrait of his father. Still trying to wrap my head around everything that was happening. Any process of thinking rationally was thrown out the window when a body came flying in from the outside. Turning to see what was happening I was petrified to see who I deduced was Antonio. Only he was transformed into some horribly grotesque creature. It was as if he’d fused with a praying mantis and had grown a good ten feet. \n\n“You call this golf?!” he screeched as he continued to seemingly throw a tantrum. Only when I heard desperate screaming did I notice that Gerald was trying to crawl away from him. The creature looked down at him and screeched again before leaning down and proceeding to bite and rip Gerald’s leg off like it was nothing. \n\n“Great. Now I need a new manager.” Sinclair shook his head and simply turned around while Antonio began to eat Gerald piece by piece. I couldn’t bear to watch it so I just quickly followed after Sinclair for my own sanity and protection. “I doubt that you would want to do it.” He told me, continuing to puff from his cigar like a chimney in winter. I honestly didn’t even want to work here anymore, so his assessment was definitely correct. \n\n“I’m sure there are other more qualified people than me, sir.” I told him as I followed him outside and back to his limo. He simply grunted at me and continued to puff on his cigar. He looked around and finally back at me, pointing a finger at me. \n\n“Do me a favor, son.” He told me, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a checkbook. “Make sure everyone stays quiet about this.” He handed the book to me and I looked at him in utter confusion. “No more than 50,000 for the men and 20,000 for the women.” He told me, turning around to enter the limo as his shadow creature opened the door for him. “Feel free to give yourself double. Good job today.” He told me as the creature closed the door behind him and the limo began to drive away. \n\n“Not bad, Ted. You made a great first impression on him. That’s hard to do.” Creole told me, appearing from behind me and causing me to nearly drop the checkbook. I spun on my heels to look at him and was surprised to see that he was completely clean. “Who knows, you could really go places. If you ever have a wish, don’t hesitate to give lil’ ol’ me a call,” he said with a chuckle and patted me hard on the back. “Come along Antonio! I think we’ve caused enough carnage for one visit.” He walked past me, tapping his cane on the floor. \n\nAntonio emerged from the inside, once again looking like a human. Brushing out his long hair with his hands he walked past me, grumbling in annoyance before he turned to look back at me for a moment. I felt a shiver go down my spine as he gave me a stare a predator gives its prey before eating. \n\n“You’re lucky I’m full,” he said with a smile, the scar on his face splitting open and a tongue rolling out of it before he turned around and followed after Creole. I stood there shivering and really considered quitting on the spot after writing myself a fat check. \n\n“Well, Theodore, thanks so much for a lovely afternoon. I must say you have one of the nicer faces I’ve seen here.” Dr. Harrison told me as he walked up next to me. He was back into his scrubs and lab coat but they had been cleaned and he looked like he was ready to go back to work.  \n\n“Oh, uh, thanks?” I told him in confusion. Our eyes met, and his glowing green eyes suddenly erased any unease I may have felt over having this job. “Stop by my clinic if you ever want some work done.” He told me with a smile as he entered my dream car and turned it on, David Bowie once again blasting through the speakers as he put pedal to meddle and began to speed away. \n\nI swallowed a lump in my throat and smacked the checkbook against my palm, thinking about how I was supposed to feel after a range of mixed emotions like that. The snarling sounds and screaming pulled me back to reality upon remembering that there was still one member of Sinclair’s party who had yet to leave. \n\nTurning around I was met with another creature, walking on four legs like a centaur and in its maw it had one of my coworkers. The creature opened its mouth and let the carcass fall out from his mouth. \n\n“Have the others left?” the creature asked me in a perfectly normal voice. I was confused and beyond shocked. The creature’s mouth hung open but words came out like a speak and spell or some sort of AI voice. \n\n“Y-yes, sir.” I nodded and held onto the checkbook for dear life. \n\n“Monsieur, would you please get back into your wheelchair?” a haggard and tired voice asked. We both looked back and noticed an exhausted-looking nurse holding the ancient-looking wheelchair out for the creature. LeBlanc looked back at me and turned itself around on all its legs and slowly walked back to the nurse. With sickening bone crunching and spasms, the creature forced its legs back into its body and sat back down in the wheelchair. The nurse put a blanket over his legs and began to roll him back into the lobby. \n\nAfter all that, there were some 47 casualties, 15 of them being fatal. Yet I was told that that was lower than the usual average. All the other employees took the checks that had been offered by Sinclair and we all collectively agreed to not speak about it to anyone. \n\nI got a promotion afterward, going from little bitch errand boy to being a premium bitch errand boy. I still have to do whatever those rich asswipes tell me to do. But at the very least they are forced to tip me. So I guess not everything was so bad off of that visit.",

        "text": "On my way home from work, I noticed a gas station that shouldn’t be there. I had driven home this way hundreds of times, and there was never a gas station there before. I nudged my best friend, Adam, who I carpooled to work with, and he woke up immediately.\n\n“Huh wha…” he said groggily, and I slowed down the car, pointing my finger.\n\n“That gas station does not belong there,” I said, pointing. \n\n“Yeah, I guess not,” he said, and prepared to go back to sleep. I nudged him again.\n\n“Let’s go check it out! It says ‘24 hours’ on it,” I said. He yawned, then nodded his head.\n\n“OK, sure, if it will make you leave me alone so I can get some sleep, I’ll go check it out with you,” he said, feeling around his pockets for some tobacco. “I’m not sure what your hard-on for it is, though. It’s just a freaking gas station.” He always hand-rolled his own cigarettes on the spot, even putting a little menthol filter into the rolling paper. He lit up the Turkish tobacco, waking up instantly as the sweet smell of it drifted through the car.\n\n“It’s a gas station that *wasn’t there* yesterday,” I pointed out. “How the hell did it go up so fast? That’s not even physically possible.”\n\n“Clearly it is, because it’s there,” he pointed out.\n\nI pulled into the parking lot, looking at the sign. “Set’s 24 Hour Service,” it read simply. The bright fluorescent lights flickered as we pulled up to a pump and got out, Adam grabbing his nearly empty backpack and putting it on without thinking, then grabbing his keys with a detachable pepper spray canister, his lighter and some tobacco.\n\nSomething skittered behind the gas station, just out of reach of the lights. A sudden smell of sulfur and rotting meat wafted over to us, making me gag.\n\n“Oh bro,” Adam said, covering his mouth and nose with his hand, “that is just *terrible.*” I nodded, putting my face in the crook of my elbow, trying not to breathe the disgusting fumes. We both walked quickly towards the door, opening it up and going inside. Instantly the smell was gone.\n\nAs the door closed behind me, I realized this was not a normal gas station. Row after row of mannequin heads were lined up in the aisle in front of me, as if they were all for sale. Some of them looked like they had actual human eyes inserted into the plastic. Bits of blood and gore still dribbled down them from the eyes. One had its mouth open, a bloody tongue inserted into the silently screaming statue.\n\n“Whoa, that is awesome!” Adam said, pointing to the mannequins as if they were Halloween decorations. I grabbed his arm.\n\n“I think we need to get out of here,” I said, a rising sense of trepidation sending off alarm bells in my head. \n\n“It’s just decorations, man,” Adam said, laughing. “Clearly this is some sort of Halloween store or something. Kind of out of season, though.” He shrugged. I shook my head, and tried backing up towards the door. Turning around, I realized it had locked behind us. I tried pulling with all my might, looking for any locks or buttons near it, but there was nothing. It had metal bar after metal bar crisscrossing it vertically and horizontally, as if to keep vandals out- or to keep unwilling hostages in.\n\n“We’re locked in,” I said simply, my voice quavering. “This isn’t right, Adam. We need to get out of here.” The panic in my voice seemed to wake him up to our situation. But he still tried to pretend like this was just a normal store.\n\n“We just need to find someone who works here,” he said calmly. “They probably locked it by mistake.” We both began looking around, and I realized that the store looked much larger on the inside than it did from the outside. “There,” he said, pointing to a glass case on the far side of the store. A man stood there with dark, nearly black eyes, staring at us from inside the bulletproof glass partition. We walked over.\n\nI noticed row after row of horrors on our way. One aisle had what looked like medieval torture devices, all dripping blood or covered in gore. I even saw what looked like intestines wrapped around some metal spikes, with a handle to turn the metal and apparently draw the intestines out of someone’s body.\n\nThe next row was taxidermied animals, at least at first. There were foxes, cats, dogs and beavers, all frozen in ferocious positions, their eyes wild and their teeth bared. As I looked farther down, I saw the bodies of children frozen in eternal screams of horror, still wearing their dresses or little suits. The heads of men and women were also taxidermied and set side by side on the aisles, all cast with different expressions- some of them smiling, some shrieking, some just staring blankly ahead with dull eyes. I stopped looking down the aisles after that.\n\n“May I help you?” the clerk said through the holes in the plastic as we neared. His dead eyes stared at Adam before flicking over to me.\n\n“I think we’re locked in,” I said, my voice trembling. The man’s eyes never left mine. I looked down at my hands.\n\n“The only way out,” he said, “is further in.” He pointed to the back of the store. “The way you exit is not the way you enter. It is below.”\n\n“What is this, some sort of riddle?” Adam asked, fuming. “Just let us the fuck out, man. We don’t want to buy any of your weird shit. Who the hell wants to buy a bunch of mannequin heads, taxidermied beavers and cat o’ nine tails?” The clerk just stared at Adam with his black eyes. “Look, if you’re not going to let us out, I’m going to smash my way out.” The clerk smiled at this, but said nothing. Adam shrugged, and went to the medieval torture aisle. I found it odd that they sold all these random, horrifying objects, but I didn’t see any food, snacks or drinks in the entire gas station. Perhaps those were all further ahead in some spot we hadn’t discovered yet.\n\nAdam grabbed a mace, a thick piece of polished wood with a spiked metal ball on the end. He went over to the door we came in through, and with one final glance back at the clerk, he began smashing the mace as hard as he could into the glass panels of the entryway.\n\nHe quickly found out that it was made of some sort of shatterproof plexiglass material. The first swing reverberated painfully back into his arm, causing him to nearly drop the mace. Then he moved over to the windows and tried smashing those out, with the same pitiful result.\n\nI checked my phone for service to see if I could call the police, but all of the metal and bulletproof glass apparently affected the signal. I had zero cell reception inside the station. It looked more and more like we had to play the clerk’s little game. We would have to go deeper inside to find a way out, as he had told us. I was quickly regretting ever stepping foot in this bizarre place.\n\nAdam massaged his right arm painfully, the shockwaves from hitting the unbreakable glass having clearly caused some minor aches. But he still held the mace in one hand.\n\n“You better grab a weapon too,” Adam said to me, his eyes serious, his normal joking  manner totally dissipated. “We have no idea what this place is, but I think it is better safe than sorry.” I nodded, going to the medieval torture instrument and weapon aisle, picking up a scimitar. The curved sword felt somehow comfortable in my hand, the weight of the metal blade perfectly balanced. I gave it a few practice swings, then turned back to him.\n\n“Well, let’s go,” I said. We began walking down an aisle with books wrapped in some white, leathery substance that looked suspiciously like human skin. I eyed them with distaste as we passed. I saw the Necronomicon, the Shadows of Solomon, the Malleus Maleficarum, the Wiccan Book of Shadows, and many other tomes I didn’t recognize. Some weren’t even written in the Latin alphabet, but looked as if they had Tibetan or Sanskrit titles instead. \n\nAdam stopped, grabbing a random grimoire that had caught his attention. On the front it simply read, ‘The Angel of Death,” in huge silver letters. The book itself was shiny and black, like a poisonous snake. A blood-red eye stared out from the bottom of it, and I saw it dripped blood continuously, as if the book itself was crying. He tucked it into his backpack.\n\n“What are we going to do with *that*?” I asked nervously. He shrugged.\n\n“My gut told me to take it. I don’t know why. Maybe if we stop I can look at it closer.” As we neared the back of the massive store, which was bigger than any department store I had ever been in, I began to smell rotting meat and sulfur again. I looked around warily.\n\n“You got your game face on, bro?” Adam asked me, also smelling the nauseating mixture. I nodded grimly. We both had our medieval weapons out and ready to swing at anything that came near us. But nothing attacked. Instead, we saw a black silhouette in the back next to a flight of stairs leading downwards.\n\nAs we got closer, the features on the silhouette became clearer. It stood over ten feet tall, nearly scraping its head on the ceiling. It had shimmering reptilian skin with dark red claws on its hands and feet, but its most distinctive feature was its eyes. They glowed like embers, brightening and dimming with every passing second as the creature stared down at us. Its hairless face had tiny slits for its nose and ears, and a lipless black mouth that formed a perfectly straight line. Adam went first, looking up at the creature suspiciously.\n\n“This is the way, friends,” it said to us in a guttural, cracking voice, gesturing with a clawed hand to the stairway. “I will see you again further in, in the space where the light grows cold and distant. My name is Set, and I greet all the fighters up above. As above, so below…” As he spoke, he began to walk backwards, and faded into the wall, until only his glowing ember eyes remained, watching our every move.\n\nAdam went first, walking very softly and giving furtive glances to the eyes seemingly embedded into the wall. I walked behind. The stairway smelt musty and ancient, reminding me of the times I had visited the catacombs in Paris. And it descended for what looked like dozens of stories, tiny, cramped steps disappearing into the dark far below. We used our cell phones for light, going slow so as not to slip. It would be a very long, and likely lethal, fall to the bottom.\n\nThe lower we went, the colder it became, until I could see my breath in the dim light of the phone. There was no handrail or anything to grab if I slipped. The wall was smooth sandstone, and as we went lower, many of the stairs were crumbling. My fear of heights made me start to hyperventilate, until Adam turned and calmed me down.\n\n“Just focus on one step at a time,” he said. “Don’t look beyond that.” After what felt like an eternity, we reached a long hallway. We sped up, walking through it.\n\nIt opened into a huge antechamber, the size of a football stadium. As soon as we stepped foot into it, a stone door slammed shut behind us, keeping us from going back the way we had come. Both of us jumped at the land slamming sound, turning abruptly.\n\nFrom behind me a thin hand grabbed my hair, wrenching my head back and putting a cold metal blade to my throat. Adam raised his weapon, but the man behind me simply laughed. His breath smelled like he was rotting from the inside. Combined with the intense odor of sweat, urine and feces that emanated off of him, it made me want to gag. But I knew I couldn’t move a single millimeter with that sharp knife pressing into my jugular.\n\n“Put down your weapon, mate,” the man said in an Australian accent. “Both of you!” I dropped my sword on the floor with a loud, echoing clatter. Adam immediately dropped his mace on the ground, putting his hands up to show they were empty.\n\n“Don’t kill him,” Adam said. “We have done nothing to you.” The man laughed.\n\n“Do you know where you are?” he said. “It doesn’t matter what you have done or not done. This is a place of death. No one leaves here alive.” The tip of the blade pressed into my skin, and I felt a few drops of blood begin to run down my neck. “Both of you, move forward.” We began to walk into the huge chamber. Torches flickered on the walls. Up ahead, I heard the insane laughter of a woman.\n\n“Finger-painting, finger-painting, just like when I was a kid,” she said, also in a deep Aussie accent. The insane rambling echoed back to us, and I could barely tell where it was coming from.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, I saw an emaciated, sickly-looking young female. She appeared to be of mixed race, with tanned skin and long hair. She wore the remnants of rags on her thin body. She reminded me of videos of death camp survivors I had seen. I could count every one of her ribs. Next to her, she had a cooked strip of skin, and occasionally stopped and took a bite out of it, smiling and cooing with pleasure at the taste.\n\n“Long pork,” she whispered, then laughed.\n\nThe smell of rotting flesh was overwhelming. It was so thick, I felt like I could taste it. I could see bodies strewn around her. She had cut off their fingers and was using the thick, clotting blood to attach them to the stone walls. I saw dozens of fingers forming random patterns all up and down the wall. Some of them were so old, the skin was falling off, the nails having turned black or purple from the inevitable decay.\n\n“We got some fresh meat, baby girl,” the man said with an insane laugh. The woman turned to look at us, and I could see in her eyes that she was totally insane as well. She barely focused on anything for more than a second. Her eyes flitted around randomly, as if she was seeing things moving all around us that weren’t there.\n\nThe bodies around her had been stripped of skin and flesh, and it seemed clear that they had been eating pieces from all of them. The waves of nausea and sickness in my stomach only grew worse.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, what sounded like a tornado siren began to sound. I felt the knife loosen slightly around my throat, and the woman looked up, shrieking in horror.\n\n“No, no, not again!” she said. Adam noticed the distraction, his eyes meeting mine. He nodded, reaching into his pocket.\n\n“Down!” Adam shrieked, and I grabbed the man’s hand, forcing it further away from my throat with all my strength, then fell to the floor. At the same instant, Adam took out the police mace from his pocket and began spraying it in a concentrated stream into the insane Aussie’s face. The lunatic screamed and fell, dropping the knife as I crawled away over the disgusting clotted blood and pieces of gore lining the floor. Within a space of seconds, my clothes and skin were covered. I gagged, trying not to throw up.\n\nThe woman ran over to the man, trying to pull him up.\n\n“They’re coming, they’re coming!” she said. But he was in such bad pain that he couldn’t even open his eyes, less likely to run from whatever horrors existed at these lower levels.\n\nAdam wrenched the knife from the man’s hand, kicking him in the face a few times for good measure, then turned to the woman. She barely weighed 100 pounds from the look of her, and it wasn’t hard to overpower her. He put the knife up to her back.\n\n“Lead us out of here, nutjob,” he said to her, and she began screaming.\n\n“No time, no time! We can’t leave my daddy,” she wept, the tears forming lines between the dirt and gore caking her face. Adam stuck the knife into the skin of her back for good measure, and she yelped.\n\n“Lead us out of here, or you’ll be dead,” he said. She nodded, her crying stopping abruptly, then pointed to a small opening in the wall further down, past the pile of bodies that had surrounded her. Adam let her go and she began to run, both of us closely following.\n\nI heard a cacophony of fluttering wings, and saw what looked like huge dragonflies descending from further down the chamber. All three of us ran into the opening just as they passed up by, the swarm focusing on the crying man as he tried to get to his feet and follow us. With a scream like someone being burned alive, I heard them swarm all over his body.\n\nA few of the dragonfly-like beasts followed us down the tunnel, and I felt a stinging sensation, like burning fire, as one bit me on the back of the neck. I slapped at it, feeling a stinger hit my hand directly in the center of my left palm. It began to swell and it took everything I had in me to not scream. I grabbed the thing and pulled it in front of me, and with horror I realized it had a tiny, human-like face on it. The face had no eyebrows or hair, but it was forced into a perpetual scream. I threw it on the ground and stomped on it.\n\n“Run!” I said, and we sprinted away, the screams of the man following us down the tunnel. It split off at various points, but the insane woman seemed to know where she was going, taking a left then the next right. Soon we could see the light of the sun ahead of us.\n\nWe emerged in a massive courtyard. The walls stood hundreds of feet tall, and creatures in cages lined the walls. Some of them looked like they had been fused together from multiple emaciated bodies. Others looked like men and women dressed in suits or hiking clothes, but their faces were totally blank, without hair or eyes or ears or a mouth. Their heads turned to watch us as we passed, however. The insane woman started crying.\n\n“Don’t want to be here, don’t want to be here,” she said.\n\n“Shut up,” Adam said to her. He looked at me. “What now?” I pulled out my phone and tried calling the police. There was no ability to call or text, but an open Wifi network came through, reading, “Set’s full service station.” I tried to open up websites for the FBI or police agencies to call for help, but they were all blocked.\n\nYet I was able to access this site, and so I started writing up my story. I know there’s only one way out, and that’s further in.\n\nThat is, if Set wasn’t lying to us. The horrors that await us seem like they’ll only grow worse.",
