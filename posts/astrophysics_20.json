I know there is a lot more too it than the basics that these books cover, but I really want to learn it. I would love to sit in a lab and preform experiments or crunch numbers all day.\n\nWould it be an easy transition from mechanical engineer to astrophysicists?

        "text": "There have been thoughts floating around in my mind a long time about dark matter, dark energy and black holes and how they could be connected somehow.\n\nFirst, my layman understanding of these phenomenon:\n\n* *Dark matter* is a theorized term, describing the unaccounted mass that is to be expected from galaxies. In other words, the amount of mass in a galaxy does not compute with the gravitational pull inside nor the outward influence on other galaxies or light.\n\n* *Dark energy* is also a theorized term, describing the unaccounted force that is needed for there to be the acceleration of the expansion of the universe. In other words, there is not enough energy from the \"Big Bang\" to account for the acceleration in the expansion of the universe.\n\n* *Black holes* are observable and are an extremely dense point that is so heavy, and therefore has so much gravitational pull, that it sucks in matter.\n\nIf these descriptions are correct, but please correct me if I'm wrong, I first have a couple of questions, and then a theory:\n\n* Where does the matter that gets sucked into a black hole go? I've seen the enormous \"plumes\" that shoot out of them on pictures/simulations, but do they contain only gasses, like I had understood, or do they account for the amount of mass that is sucked in, in other words, does matter \"disappear\" into a black hole?\n\n* Does dark matter only \"occur\" in galaxies, in other words, does dark matter \"need\" a black hole?\n\nIf both are answered with a \"yes\":\n\nWhat if the matter that gets sucked up in all black holes around the universe, somehow, lands at the *outside*, the *edge* of the universe? What if that matter then accounts for the \"dark energy\", instead of an inside push, an outside pull?\n\nWhat if the gravitational pull of the black holes in the centers of galaxies is \"underestimated\". What if only counting the stars and their mass is not enough? What if some extra pull from the black hole in the center could account for \"dark matter\"?\n\nAm I thinking too simple, am I ignorant, stupid, please explain.\n\nEdit: small corrections",

How can that be if the speed limit is thus dictated itself determined by the mass, just as is the case with the terrestrial escape velocity? It's now so no mass in his property known to us and composition can cross a black hole, it dissolves as mass because it has completely transformed into energy.\n\nIn addition, a further compression would in any case not be possible if she would not injure those between law maxim Alster energy and minimal size. If they could further condense the existing energy potential would be far greater than mc^2 . But a further compression in the direction of infinity would produce an infinitely high energy. And this is not possible.\n\nI have a flaw?\n\nmc^2 = Gm1m2 / a1 like a consistent manner mc^2 = Gm1 / a1.\n\nAccordingly, if a mass should have compressed to the size of a black hole, as is commonly said, then go from that object has a gravitational force equal to c^4 / G (Planck energy) with a corresponding maximum radiated power of c^5 / G (Planck power) from.

        "text": "I was researching some cosmological units and became interested in the radius of the observable universe. I had assumed this to be 13.7 billion light years, or the age of the universe since the big bang. I was educated on the fact that to due to universal expansion, the radius of the observable universe is now around 46.6 billion light years. But I thought then..., the photons from that point in time would be from when the universe was largely all hydrogen and helium composed white hot plasma. So then I started to think of stars... I know some stars are old... almost as old as they universe. I found that recently discovered SMS0313 is around 13.6 billion years old...only 100000000 (.1B) years from the age of the universe itself. SMS0313 happens to be around only 6000 lightyears from earth. If the star (SMS0313) is 13.6 billion years old, how is it that it is 6000 light years away. Yet if I think of another star, (I will use one of my fave stars), Vega...Vega is only 850mill yo and 25 light years away, and yet Gliese 581 which has been in the news so much due to Kepler, is 22.02 ly away, and about the same age as our own sun, 5bill yo. I sort've realize this question may not be sound because a stars formation doesn't depend on how far it is... and they are independent variables. But can someone explain these data a bit more for me? Also if you happen to know... Can you sum up cosmological expansion... there should constant for it, right? Perhaps some distance over some time or something.... Thanks, would appreciate it! \n\nCheers",

I think the semester off was productive as it gave me experience in my field, but it sort of made me realize I love music, but don't have a passion for teaching it..\n\nI love love playing my gigs, but the work is feast or famine, and honestly, the lifestyle was starting to get to me (really late nights, unruly crowds, arguing with owners trying to screw you with pay, and drinking in bars)\n\nMusic has always been a passion, but so has astrophysics. I chose music because though because I thought I'd love to teach it, but I don't.. I love playing it..\n\nSo I'm thinking about returning to school to pursuit astrophysics, but I'm unsure if the major would be right with me, as I've been two-three years removed from math classes. I'm willing to put in the work, and I know there will be late nights as well, but not that it seems \"less stressful\", the work seems more beautiful. I'm honestly just tired of the music scene, I've been playing for five years now. \n\nSpace has been a hobby since I was a little kid, and I'm an amateur \"star gazer\", so I've always had a fascination\n\nQUESTION \n\nWhat are some things I can expect majoring in astrophysics? how are the classes? do you think someone like me can do this or is it too late? are there any quality AFFORDABLE (big reason I dropped out of Berklee was money) universities to study in the states?\n\nThank you all so much for any help and insight you might have for me!\n\nTL;DR\n\nMusic student tired of the music scene and two years removed from math, just wants to know what to expect if I major in my second passion of astrophysics\n\nThank you!",

If your watching something fall into a black hole it will eventually appear to stop from an observers perspective outside the black hole. That I understand. If that happens though, why isn't that information still on all black holes from everything that's fallen into then from the beginning, and that we can still see this information? Is it that if one isn't actually constantly observing the item, then there is no information left and no information to transmit to a later observer? Hopefully my question made some sense.",

        "text": "The smallest black hole that can form in nature is about 4 solar masses. I know that the sun's surface gravity is about 25 G. I know that the sun is about half a million kilometers big, give or take. So lets simplify. Let's assume that a certain \"fairly small\" black hole has a 100G gravity of one 100 at 500.000 kilometers. \n\nThat would mean that at twice that distance, G pulling on anything i orbit would be half that, or about 50 G. Let's continue this\n\n* one million kilometers // 50 G\n* two million kilometers // 25 G\n* four million kilometers // ~12 G\n* eight million kilometers // 6 G\n* 16 million kilometers // 3 G\n* 32 million kilometers // 1,5 G\n* 65 million kilometers - slightly under one G.\n\nSo, simplifying, at about 50 million kilometers (about the distance from the sun to Mercury) distance from an object (which happens to be the smallest type of black hole that naturally forms) the gravitational pull is as strong as exerted by the Earth.\n\nNote, that same object exerting a G pull (make sure you have powerful engines or you will be stuck there) will be about the size of your hometown - i.e. several kilometers. There would be no visible black hole, even with a very powerful telescope. You might with a telescope mounted on a space craft orbiting at 50 million kilometers be able to see some minor light distorting, but *nothing* we can ever engineer will be able to get anywhere near this spot at anything under many millions of kilometers. \n\nQuestion - if the sun would be in a decaying orbit around the above 4 solar mass black hole, how long would it take before the black hole had completely eaten the sun? How big would the inner and outer regions of the accretion disk become? Tens of millions of kilometers? Millions of kilometers? hundreds of thousands of kilometers? I am having trouble parsing the scales involved here. \n\nMercury orbits the sun in something like 225 days. In the above example an equivalent planet at a similar distance would move a little faster, let's round up to about 64 days. Let's infer from that.\n\n* 25 million kilometers - 32 days\n* 12 million kilometers - 16 days\n* 6 million kilometers - 8 days\n* 3 million kilometers - 4 days\n* 1 million kilometers - slightly over a day\n* 500.000 kilometers - about 12 hours\n* 250.000 kilometers - about 6 hours\n* 125.000 kilometers - about 3 hours \n\nAm I still seeing this vaguely approximately correct here? When does an equivalent mercury start ripping to shreds based on tides in the above example?\n\n",

        "text": "I may need to go to the Explain It Like I'm Five.  \n\nI have seen time explained in terms of light movement, and that makes the most sense to me.  I was playing around with little diagrams of lightwaves in different dimensional space (assuming that waves move in the same manner as we perceive them).  Assuming that the wavelength was consistent, a first-dimension would be either permanent light or permanent darkness.  Light and dark would exist as unchanging points going \"left\" or \"right\".  \n\nI may be unclear on the basic concept of \"space-time\", but my current understanding is that you can give 4D coordinates one of two ways.  You can say I'll meet you on the corner of 10th street and 12th avenue, on the 5th floor at 2 PM.  Or you can give coordinates in a tesseract.  \n\nLight moves in waves through our three-dimensional space in directional waves.  Has any sort of theoretical work been done on how it moves through fourth dimensional (vacuum) space?  Would it move in different directions simultaneously?  Would it be possible to measure something in a light-year, or would 4th dimensional space require a totally different concept of space-time?",
