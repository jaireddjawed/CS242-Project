Read a bit about stocks, followed some people who knew stuff. Know some general lingo, I also look into historical data and the advanced charts section. Options are a bit crazy when I was looking into them, so I\u2019m definitely going to hold off on that for now until I get more knowledge and even then I won\u2019t be putting much into it.\n\nApparently I\u2019m a swing trader, the whole buying the dip and selling high. I\u2019m not sure what reasonable expectations for gains are per year. But I\u2019m sure they can\u2019t be too crazy since I\u2019m purely invested into big tech companies (Tesla, Amazon, Google, etc) and buying whole stocks. I told myself to sell immediately once a stock reaches 7% gain (haven\u2019t been exactly doing that\u2026), but I\u2019m on the fence-ish about that. With some hiccups here and there, this is where I\u2019m at now. I can\u2019t help but think I\u2019m holding onto stocks for a little too long. I think I have a general feel for the market since my positions have been \u201crelatively\u201d good. What do you guys think? Any tips, recommendations?\n\nOn a side note, I\u2019ve been hearing about EFTs and investing in VOO, but the potential gain is a bit low for me. I like to be a bit more riskier and I\u2019m also not trying to hold onto stocks for long.","upvote_ratio":0.29,"created_utc":1669424004.0},{"title":"Daily Discussion Thread - November 24th, 2022","author":"Robot_of_Sherwood","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RobinHood\/comments\/z3h2rv\/daily_discussion_thread_november_24th_2022\/","text":"## Join Robinhood and  get a free share!\n\nThinking of opening a Robinhood account?
