However, it seems that today Asian-Americans have more positive outcomes in healthcare, education, socio-economic factors versus African-Americans and Latinos. I was wondering why that was so and how they were able to overcome those systemic biases?\n\nI am not that well versed in US History so I may be off base on some of these facts as well.",

        "text": "Every time reddit closes down some set of questionable subreddits, people assemble in the comments to complain about it, usually to no one else's audience. One of those recent subreddits was a subreddit about gun selling. One of the complaints someone had was that the gun selling subreddit followed the law \"to a T\". I had a strong gut reaction of tension about it like I usually do when I suspect people are doing shady things. It wasn't because I doubted him. It was because it made so much sense that he was right.\n\nI was reminded of the [work-to-rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule) tactic in organized labor struggles. What you do is literally what the rules tell you to do and nothing else. It's effective because rules are usually bad or imply some unspoken other factor like unwritten rules, and following the written rules \"to a T\" screws everything up.\n\nI'm also familiar with the J-curve from the relationship between drinking alcohol and health outcomes, where there's a sweet spot to drinking alcohol and drinking more or even less has worse health outcomes. (This might have to do with the disproportionate representation of past alcoholics in the zero-drink group, and I'm probably going to research that hypothesis after I post this.)\n\nI put these two observations together to get a hypothesis that the most social people probably break a few laws, while the most antisocial people break lots of laws, and people doing shady things are \"working to rule\" with the law.\n\nI think my hypothesis is pretty simple. Still, I can't even imagine a study design to determine it. Are you familiar with any research that addresses such a claim?",

What are some good resources for learning more about this subject? \n\nHere is the full quote from his [Nobel Prize](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292229/) biography:\n\n&gt;I had the most satisfying Eureka experience of my career while attempting to teach flight instructors that praise is more effective than punishment for promoting skill-learning. When I had finished my enthusiastic speech, one of the most seasoned instructors in the audience raised his hand and made his own short speech, which began by conceding that positive reinforcement might be good for the birds, but went on to deny that it was optimal for flight cadets. He said, “On many occasions I have praised flight cadets for clean execution of some aerobatic maneuver, and in general when they try it again, they do worse. On the other hand, I have often screamed at cadets for bad execution, and in general they do better the next time. So please don't tell us that reinforcement works and punishment does not, because the opposite is the case.” This was a joyous moment, in which I understood an important truth about the world: because we tend to reward others when they do well and punish them when they do badly, and because there is regression to the mean, it is part of the human condition that we are statistically punished for rewarding others and rewarded for punishing them. I immediately arranged a demonstration in which each participant tossed two coins at a target behind his back, without any feedback. We measured the distances from the target and could see that those who had done best the first time had mostly deteriorated on their second try, and vice versa. But I knew that this demonstration would not undo the effects of lifelong exposure to a perverse contingency.",

        "text": "I know this is going to be a very long question , I would like the following themes addressed . To give a context of who I am , I am from a sexually conservative society. I am curious about sexuality in liberal societies.\n\n* I would like arguments for or against sexually liberal society (non discouragement for pre-marital sex -teenage sex - swinger culture) vs moderately conservative society( discouragement of pre-marital sex , mated for life , strong belief in marriage institution) which would have best outcome for common good ?\n\n\n\n\n* How does the mating competition favour both genders? does it tip the scale of balance towards one gender ? [A believe the balance has shifted toward females with rise medical advancement like contraceptive because earlier a women had to choose her mate carefully as unlike male once she is pregnant she could not reproduce for an year which means a female has to be choosy where as a male has to reproduce with as much female to increase the chances of passing on his linage , however with the contraceptives this disadvantage for women is removed. since a women's biological directives seek her to find best of the male who probably represent small percentage of male population , which means there would always be a pie of males who would never get laid as likely as females [alpha males having multiple female partners over the course of his lifetime] in  it encourage rise of alpha male societies , with a large bunch of beta-males most likely virgins ending up with non-virgin partners .The above stated ones are merely my own hypothesis I welcome people to dismantle or support it so I can recalibrate my opinions  ]\n\n\n\n* Does the concept of serial monogamy exist ? ( constant divorces and remarriages)\n\n\n\n* does broken marriages result in broken families with bad developmental outcomes for kids ? ( step-dad molesting , child poverty etc.) I had mentioned broken marriages because divorce seem to be more common in western societies. The society I am from believe in marriage for life at-least that's what the society encourages or coherces them to do .\n\n\n* I have also read that a phenomenon called cuckold ( a father forced to raise his non-biological offspring without himself knowing about it ) seems to have higher occurrences in western liberal societies ? Does this phenomenon even exist ? if it exist doesn't it encourage alpha male behaviour ? \n\n\n* What does the act of sex means for people of liberal societies ? is it simple like a kiss , handshake or something complex and emotionally connecting that has to be shown to only people whom they would believe to have relationship for life?\n\n\n\nPS- I know the lot of above question seems like an accusation against sexually liberal societies , But that's not my intend I genuinely like to learn about the merits and demerits of the sexually liberal society . I been raised in a conservative family so I might have some misconception that may reflect in above question , if that's the case please correct me. I am strong believer in individual rights , but I also believe set of rules has to be set in place for society to function without chaos. However when I think about sexuality as both of these philosophy that I hold dear collides it creates a paradox that I cant make sense. So I believe by listening to your answers I can come to the right conclusion about sexually liberal societies myself.",

Compared to crime committed between familiar people, investigation tactics are unreliable, and in the case of rewards, costly. In this case, it seems like it would actually be encouraged for urban survival to pack common calibers if guns in the event someone else might start shooting.

This dichotomy where the light side of life must be embraced like compassion, life, empathy and so on, while anything else must be repressed.\n\nHowever, I am finding some flaws in this. Much like the concept of the yin and the yang in Eastern philosophy, having only one side of the philosophy is not a healthy choice and exposure to the yin from time to time is a more healthy one since when you continuously repress or avoid anything that is undesired will make you ill-prepared for those desired or anxious phenomena and may be even overwhelmingly uncomfortable when you continuously avoid them and they suddenly burst out\n\n*(think of the concept of homework. The more you continously avoid doing them, the amount of homework you will have will increase and eventually, the amount of anxiety that you feel use you have to do all of them at once will ve overwhelming)*\n\nThe philosopher Nietzsche even criticised about this although he was specifically referring to the Roman Catholic religion where he used the master-slave morality as a concept where the Roman Catholic religion empowers being 'the slave', so to speak, which empowered being compassionate, humble and mediocrity while it demonized and suppressed the more 'selfish' desires such as lust for example.  *(which explains Nietzsche's concept of Ubermench about a person who lives beyond humans. That is, a person is lives with his own concepts and morals and lives beyond the shared concepts of good and evil which were mostly shared by the Roman Catholic church)*",

But this is a bit of a complication since the word 'intellect' or 'intelligence' is tricky to describe accurately and there are animals that are capable of other feats of 'intelligence' like beavers can build dams, dolphins can retain memory and chimpanzees can do sign language, even though Aristotle once called humans as ' the rational animal' which may be explained as there is a theory that our ancestors' discovery of fire and the use of cooking with that fire may allowed us to develop more brain cells as the food have been more nutritious compared to raw food and the proteins would have been broken down already by the fire meaning that certain proteins would have been easier to digest once ingested.\n\nThe second guess could be our social habits. Of course, that other species exhibit social behaviours like wolves are often found in packs, primates often exhibit social interactions like empathy and compassion and care for the young and other primates. Despite this, humans have the ability to develop other social traits like creating languages that many members of the social group share, whether it is via use of words, art, body language and so on. Other forms of social traits are the formation of cultures like social values and norms, ideologies and philosophies and social structures and other social aspects that form social behaviour, social thought and so on.\n\nBut my best guess could be a combination of three that seem to influence each other",
