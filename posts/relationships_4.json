        "text": "My wife and I have been married just under a year, but have been together way longer than that. Essentially, she has gained some weight over the years and is unhappy with how she looks and feels. She struggles with some mental health concerns and so is working with a therapist on healthy ways to lose weight. \n\nI want her to be happy for sure. We're running into some small effects on the relationship though. \n\n1. We've cut down on eating out. We used to eat out twice a week, now we are down to twice a month. The two of us have very different hobbies and interests, and I didn't realize how much this small change would take away from time together. Eating out was a big thing we did together and without it, our evenings after work are largely empty, or spent individually. We do go to the gym two mornings a week, but evenings are still an issue. We'll play the \"I dunno what do you want to do\" game a bit, and then just retreat to our separate rooms. Fine most of the time, but it would be nice to find at least a partial replacement. Cooking together would be an easy one, but my wife is HANGRY when she comes home and doesn't want me anywhere near her when she makes dinner. \n\n2. Another thing her therapist recommended was mindful eating, which means dinner at the table most nights. Before this, we never ate at the table, always on the couch with the TV on, scarfing food down in 10-ish minutes. Now we're at the table and conversation is a struggle sometimes. After all these years it can be hard to find conversation topics! Do we just...eat in silence? \n\nSmall problems for sure, but I would love tips and advice. \n\n**Tl;Dr my wife is trying to lose weight and her lifestyle changes require relationship adjustments**",

        "text": "So I (24M) dated a girl (19F) who's relatively younger to me for a year. It might sound like a big age gap but we actually met at work. She worked while doing college simultaneously. She was the one who actually started flirting and asked me out.\n\nAnyway our relationship for a year was pretty good. Some minor arguments but nothing serious. Eventually during the end, issues started popping up. Our parents knew of our relationship but her family had some issues which increased fights between us.\n\nLet's just say we didn't end on a good note. While we both had our actions leading to the end, I handled the ending a little worse and ended up getting angry and ranting and saying some things which I shouldn't have. \n\nShe got sad, blocked me from everywhere and said \"I don't trust you. All boys are the same\" (even though I was her first boyfriend).\n\nAnyway, we did talk occasionally through social media. After 5 months of breakup, we had a good talk on call for a few days (2-3 hours each time). \n\nI realized she has feelings for me and even I did. The conversations were very smooth without any awkwardness and involved casual flirting. But she blocked me out of the blue saying \"I can't move on. Go find someone else\".\n\nBlocking this time felt worse since I got attached to her again. Today, I managed to contact her and told her that I miss her. She agreed to meet. We walked for 2 hours and things were perfect. We chatted, teased each other, even had brief romantic moments of hand holding (nothing sexual since it was a public place). \n\nBut at the end of the meet, she said \"I won't meet you again\".\n\nNow I'm confused if the meet went so well, if our calls were great and comforting in the past (for both of us), why does she push me away.\n\nAnd if she does really hate me or not have any feelings, why talk or meet? Even during our not talking stage she mentioned \"You don't make efforts to win me.\" \"You left me alone\".\n\nAnd when I am making the efforts, she says \"Please don't ne stuck on me. Go find someone else\".\n\nI know the best advice would be to focus on my life and move on. I do focus on my life. I work a good job, I workout, I socialize. Nothing like the typical Devdas. But well, I still love her?\n\ntl;dr:- Ex gives me signs of having feelings but pushes me away.",

One of the questions was something along the lines of who will have beautiful kids and a friend joked that it's not likely to be me because of my bf. It was only a joke and i laughed it off since my friends are better looking than me anyway so I wasn't expecting them to choose me. \n\nThe next morning I talking to my bf about the night and he was asking what we got up to and I mentioned the drinking game. I thought it was funny so told him about the comment and he went quiet. I asked what was wrong and tried explaining that everyone had been drinking and it was just a joke but he said I should have said something to my friend and stood up for him since they were obviously mocking him. I tried explaining it wasn't like that and it was just a stupid game where pretty much everyone got insulted at some point in the night and he said it's not the same. Does anyone have any advice?\n\ntl;dr my friends made a comment about my bf when me and my friends were playing a drinking game and my bf got upset about it when I told him.

        "text": "TL;DR met a man while in a relationship... became friends with him and his girlfriend, became more than friends, cut him off for the sake of my relationship. Can't stop thinking about him despite being committed to my partner. What can I do.\n\n\nI will acknowledge immediately that this whole situation was a recipe for disaster, and I am at fault for not stopping it sooner. I fully accept and take responsibility for this.\n\n\n\nI (31f) met Adam (30m) at work almost 10 years ago, when I was 22 and he was 21. We became immediate friends. It is hard to find people that appreciate my sense of humor, let alone reciprocate it. There was definitely sexual tension between us as time went on, but I had confidence that I would be able to keep the line drawn in the sand, seeing as we both were in long term relationships (mine being nearly 7 years at that point). This was my first mistake. We became so close that I considered him one of my best friends. We always seemed to know what the other was thinking or needing. Finished each other's sentences. He always had me laughing. He saw me at my most vulnerable and comforted me as I cried. He shared his vulnerabilities with me. We would hang out for hours and even if we were just talking, it felt like little time had passed at all. \n\n\n\nHe introduced me to his girlfriend, Lisa (28f), who I also became very close with. She shared the same sense of humor and I was always happy in her company. We hung out together after work all the time. Eventually Adam and Lisa started casually mentioning in conversation how they were looking for a third person to bring into their relationship but it was hard to find someone they could trust. After a time, they started outright saying that they wanted it to be me, that it could only be me.\n\n\n\nAt this point in time I had been having some major issues in my relationship with my partner (32m) for years that were about to overflow. I did love him still, but I'd felt unappreciated, disrespected and unloved for the better portion of a decade... I had been having trouble ignoring my feelings for Adam for some time and realized I was also developing feelings for Lisa, but instead of shutting things down...I allowed them to grow, because I selfishly did not want to give up my friendship with them. It was literally the only bright spot in my life, besides my children. \n\n\n\nEventually the sexual tension overflowed. My relationship with my partner was basically \"indifferent roommates with kids\" at that point. It had been years since I'd had any sexual encounter that was anything but painful, reluctant \"duty\", any regular interaction I had with my partner ended in feelings of disappointment or anger, and I had no clue how starved for affection and love I was. Over the course of a couple of months, without even having sex those two showed me so much of what I didn't even realize I was missing. One night 3 years ago it kind of came to a head and I ended up having sex with Lisa... while Adam was actively involved in the situation there was no penetration on his part.\n\n\n\nAfterwards, I immediately realized I had fucked up. I went home and confessed to my partner... I was so upset over what I'd done that I spent the entire day dry heaving and shaking. I deserved every second of it and more. My partner said that he was okay with what I had done with Lisa but not Adam. He would only stay if I cut Adam off immediately. I did, without question. And I have spent the last 3 years grieving what honestly almost feels like losing a family member. Lisa and I settled our feelings and are still friendly with each other but every time we do talk I am reminded of Adam, so it's hard. I am committed to fixing things with my partner...we've been to therapy, spilled our guts, cried, worked on ourselves and us together, and things have improved...I don't understand why I still think about Adam and I don't know how I can make it stop. I don't expect pity or advice from my partner so I won't ask him for that among other obvious reasons, and my friends say that what I'm feeling is okay as long as I don't act on it. I disagree. I shouldn't be feeling any sort of way about him since I intend to be with my partner. \n\n\n\nHas anyone ever dealt with a situation like this? How can I let go of these residual feelings? What am I supposed to do... I realize I'm a massive piece of trash for cheating, I've already paid the price and continue to try and atone every single day. I just want to stop thinking about Adam, because every time I do it makes me feel so guilty and bad.",

        "text": "\nFor some context:\n\nMy friend and I have been very close since middle school. His social awareness is pretty poor, but overall he’s a good kid. He invited me to visit him in Miami for my spring break and birthday, and I said that I couldn’t afford it. I mentioned it in passing it to my dad, and though I didn’t expect him or want him to, he used some of his JetBlue points to buy me a flight for a three-day stay. He’s struggling financially a bit right now so I felt pretty bad but he told me to “make sure that I had fun”. \n\nStory:\n\nBefore I went to visit, he told me that he would be working one day that I was staying, but I could use his car and explore in the meantime. I would have just explored a bit, but he lives in an apartment complex in a not-so-great area. Since that was a concern of mine, I agreed since I would be able to use his car. Mind you, kind of a side note, I have a clean driving record, have never been in one accident, and am a very safe driver. On the other hand, every time I get in his car when he drives, we almost get into an accident every time at his fault, and he doesn’t know the rules in the road and actually came to a complete stop in the middle of the highway once to look into the backseat to see if he remembered his leftovers.\n\nThe first day, I arrived around 6PM, and he told me that he was getting out of work late. I went to a restaurant near the airport, and waited until he arrived at 7:30PM. We then went to his apartment, got there at 8PM, and just played video games. I went to bed at 1PM, but he stayed up until 5AM.\n\nThe second day, I tried waking him up, but he refused to get out of bed until 1PM. I was pretty pissed off since I was hanging out in the apartment since 11AM and wanted to go out. We finally were able to go downtown and to the beach, but only had two hours because he had to go back home to take an online CPR test. Afterwards, we met up with his girlfriend and friend, and he told me that he had a plan for the night, and took us to a bowling alley that had a two hour wait. I suggested we explore the area, but he said that he wanted to go bowling. We went to another alley, but it was their last day and the bowling lanes were being torn down. He wanted to go to another alley, but thankfully his girlfriend stepped in and said that I should choose since I’m visiting him for my vacation and should have a say in what the plan is. We went to a social bar and had a bit of fun. I then asked him what time I had to drop him off at work the next day, and he then changed his mind about me driving and said that he would “have to think about it”. This pissed me off as well as his girlfriend and friend since he lied, probably to get me to take the trip in the first place. After arguing for a bit, he pulled his friend into it, and without asking said his friend could give me a ride to the beach. His friend couldn’t and I told him not to worry about it and that he shouldn’t even have to since it wasn’t the original plan. He then got angry and said that I could drive him to work and use the car. \n\nThe next morning, I woke up and he was gone. He said that he got called in early and I was sleeping so he didn’t want to wake me.  I spent my whole time in his apartment from 10AM-6:30PM doing nothing but playing video games since there was nothing else to do. All of the Ubers were $60-$70 to go downtown and I didn’t take one because I am in between jobs and didn’t want to spend the money if I didn’t have to. He got home, and I was furious, and his excuse was “the day is over but the night has just begun”. I was livid since I wanted to go to the beach and get some sun (it was raining in his area but one hour away it was sunny so I could have just driven there). He then told me that the plan was to go to his gymnastics gym from 8PM-10PM, where I could watch him and his gym friends do gymnastics. Again, I was livid. I told him that I was on vacation and didn’t want to sit there and watch him do gymnastics for two hours. He then fought me over it, saying that he goes 3x/wk and he had finals next week so if he didn’t go he wouldn’t be able to go for a week. I literally exploded on him, and he said I could use his car while he was there and to be back at 10PM. I dropped him off and went to a beautiful casino to look around and play a slot machine for fun, and left promptly to pick him up at 10PM. I texted him, and he said that they were just hanging out and finishing up, and that he would be out in 15 minutes. 15 minutes turned into 45 minutes, and I called his girlfriend, who yelled at him to leave the place.\n\nWe got dinner at 11:30 and he paid for me to “make it up to me”, and that I shouldn’t be upset because “the past is in the past”. I told him that my dad sent me here to have fun, and he dismissed it saying that my dad didn’t pay money but used his JetBlue points. I wanted to strangle him at this point, because someone with at least two brain cells could’ve realized that you need to spend money to get points. He then *still* didn’t ask what I wanted to do, and said that we were meeting up with his buddies at a country-style bar/club to play pool. I told him I wasn’t feeling it and would rather go to the casino, but he said that they meet up every week after the gym and that he had to. I then sent his girlfriend a long text explaining how pissed off and upset I was, and she apologized and said that there’s no use talking sense into him. \n\nWhen we got home around 2:30AM, he asked to play video games but I said no and went straight to bed. I am at the airport now waiting to leave and he had no idea why I was upset about the whole trip. I was planning on having him be the best man in my wedding, but not anymore. I don’t know if this is for advice or what, but I did just want to get this off of my chest.\n\nTl;dr - My friend convinced me to visit him for my spring break and ended up doing what he wanted to do 3/4 of the stay. I ended up staying in his apartment for an entire day of the two day trip since he promised that I could drive his car when I visited but changed his mind once I was there.",

        "text": "Tl:Dr; my girlfriend said men are terrible using a very poor analogy and I'm upset at her.\n\n\nMe and my girlfriend have always seemed to have a rather... tumultuous relationship with politics. I'm extremely feminine which she seems to desire a lot, and we've been happy together for the last 8 months.\n\n\n\nI've always considered myself to be a feminist and understand that women go through a ton of stuff in the world they really shouldn't have to. I've had several past girlfriends who opened my eyes to a lot of it, and I realize there's a lot of work that needs to be done, and that there are a lot of terrible people out there making things worse for folks.\n\n\nLast week my gf got into an argument with one of our mutual friends about why women are dating less, and how it came down to how shitty men were. Now, I get it - there's a ton of shitty guys out there, and I understand the frustration. I don't usually feel the need to butt in. But then she made the analogy that men are like a bowl of candies mixed with poison - and how if 40% of the candy was poison, of course you'd be really hesitant about dipping your hand into it and trying some.\n\n\nOn the car ride home I told her I couldn't believe she'd use that analogy. It's the same one that's been employed by anti-immigration ideologues and racists for years and years and years. She knows this, we've even talked about it once. She held her ground and felt it was appropriate. I told her I didn't want to be with someone who'd negatively generalize a group like that, and use that analogy, much less stick by it. \n\n\nI then got accused of \"not-all-men\"ing the conversation and it derailed from there until I told her I was just done and didn't feel like we would be compatible, and that I felt like she had deep seated feelings towards men that she needed to address. Not gonna lie, I feel like she fetishized my femininity in her head and doesn't see me as a man, which I am, but that's a whole other thing.\n\n\nAm I overreacting or am I allowed to be offended by this?",

        "text": "Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 9 months now and they have been great! We connect really well emotionally, we're both comfortable fully opening up to each other about deep topics or issues we have with each other. We're both very respectful and kind to each other and have never once yelled at each other or had a classic \"fight\" despite covering topics which may have devolved into a fight for other relationships. We both love each other and remind each other every day of it.\n\nThe problem we're having right now is she says the spark she had for me hasn't been there for the last couple months. She says she still loves me and cares about me, but she doesn't feel that same crush or excitement for me and it has made her not look forward to the days we can see each other. For context she goes to college and i work nights full time, we only really get to see each other twice a week at best on my days off which are random. Anyways, one of the biggest reasons for losing the spark she said is I never make her laugh that much. There have been times i have made her laugh really hard, but the number is definitely less than 10. During our hangouts we'll chuckle here and there and make dumb jokes, but nothing that ever has us dying laughing. To make things worse, recently we've been frequently having serious, difficult, and scary conversations about our plans for the future, showing affection, doing more with our limited time, our views on intimacy, etc. This combined with not feeling thrilled with our time together has made her lose her spark.\n\nWe had talked all about it about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and since then ive worked on it and our time together has gotten better, and she and I have both enjoyed it more! We've been laughing more, having longer conversations, and just enjoying our time together more. However, as of today we had to have more serious talks again which got sad and scary, and she mentioned the spark still isn't there for her. Its still the same issue and having talks like these so often makes it so much worse for her. The real problem is that I'm a very quiet guy by nature, I've never had many friends, I was homeschooled, and I never developed well socially. Carrying conversations is hard for me and I'm not always the funniest person but im trying. I try to make up for it by always being kind of understanding, but that can never fully make up for being funny or entertaining. For her being silly and stupid is funny, but thats a part of me I locked away as a kid and am having trouble getting back to now.\n\nI just don't really know what to do. She needs funner times and more laughs. She has laughs with friends and classmates, but she wants them to be with me, and obviously I want that too. but after hearing that she doesn't look forward to seeing me and doesn't have a crush on me anymore im pretty devastated and don't know if I can even muster being positive. Also she has spring break coming up and will be off for a bit more than a week, but she only wants to see me for 3 of those days and maybe a couple days in the afternoon before I go into work in the evening. That hurts me too because there's nothing stopping us from seeing each other more. I get if she wants time to herself but we only see each other once or twice a week. I love this girl and I can see myself marrying her, but with all of this it feels like I'm fighting an uphill battle and losing.\n\nWhat should I do here and how do I bring the spark back? The absolute last thing I want to do is break up with her. Shes a one of a kind girl and I still want a future with her more than anything.\n\n\nTLDR: My girlfriend lost her crush for me because I dont make her laugh enough and our relationship has needed lots of serious talks recently. I am sad now and don't know how to win her back.",

We talked briefly, and before he left he asked to exchange numbers.\n\nIn the following weeks we gradually grew closer, from a casual cafe chat to weekly and then daily meme exchanges. After 3 weeks, we finally had our first date partying together with his friends, and first kiss. A week after: first overnight stay. NYE, he brought me to dinner with his parents, and partying w his friends, and he sent pics with me to a dozen of his friends and biz connections. All was great.\n\nAfter that we were apart for a month because I visited my parents in another city. But we texted daily, flirts and all. He flew there (city I was in) for a biz thing, and we partied with more friends of his. Then a week after that, I flew back to the city we both are based in, mostly to be near him (because I can afford to work from anywhere). When I communicated this move and the reason, he was happy. \n\nAfter I landed, we were closer than ever before. Seeing each other every day for 3 days, in many contexts (airport pickup, work together at home, chilling at friend's). Not all my asking. \n\nAnd then, we stopped seeing each other. It started with 3 days without texts from him, and when I asked, he cited \"busy\". Then more days without any other communications from him except his occasional complaints about work. I tried to make the chat box alive for a week with memes or a simple \"are things alright\", but finally couldn't take it anymore and asked for a meal together. He didn't read my texts.\n\nAnother week, I asked him to be straightforward and tell me if he's no longer interested, because we might bump into F23 confused after he (M33) brought me to his parents' and ghosted me other so ghosting would cause awkwardness. He still said \"hectic weeks\". So I sent over a long text saying: I wish him lucks, but I am not happy with the 0 comms, and in the future when he has capacity and interest again, ping me. He hasn't read that text.\n\nWeeks later I see pics of him flying to another city, or hanging out with friends, etc. And I feel like a fool for being ghosted.\n\nNow, I trust that he was busy for real (his sister, when bumped into me, also said so). And maybe he's still busy. However, I am confused by this level of... disrespect? Is there any other logical/cultural ways to explain such behaviours?\n\ntl;dr: we were seeing each other, I felt our bond was growing, he brought me to friends', parents', and suddenly he ghosted me. Any explanation?",

I realize they’re looking for something serious which could be a reason. I now starting seeing this beautiful young lady 30F and we both share a lot of similar interests. The only think is that she’s uncomfortable with me seeing other women while I’m dating her because she said she feels jealous and that I’m immature. \n\nFrom the beginning, she knew I was seeing other women but wasn’t that bothered, I noticed she changed after we started regularly sleeping with each other. She also told me I’m fooling myself because the girls I’m seeing just want to score with a black guy but don’t love me (lol) I was so taken back because she’s white. \n\nShe’s independent and works as a nurse, I really commend her for her contribution to society. I told her to contact me if her mindset changes over time and she just got furious with me and lashed out of my place. After about two weeks she texts me saying she was wrong to have met me and trust me. I’m starting to get bad feelings with her and don’t want this to become anything serious. Advice ?\n\nTDLR - girl I’m seeing wants relationship to only be between us but my interests don’t align with her agenda and she’s acting negatively",

She positively reacted to some comments I made and supported my positions. Today - she on vacation and I noticed that she has blocked me again on social media.\n\nI find her behavior to be confusing. We are both gay though I don't know if that matters....When we first talked she was very flirty and said she wanted to hang out soon. We talked vaguely to hang, but never made plans. She told me she has social anxiety but is trying to get out of the house more. After she told me that I didn't ask her to hang out cause I want to respect that. About two weeks ago we even talked for 3 hours straight just about random life stop. She opened up to me about some hardship she was experiencing.\n\nI am trying not to take it personally since I understand not wanting your co-workers to see what you are up too on vacation, but it seems completely different from what she was doing even 1 week ago.

        "text": "The way this all started was she wanted to get some practice to help support her studies and he wanted to help her out with the added perk of getting free massages. He started getting them before I moved away but even then it bothered me a little but I felt like it was unreasonable since I don’t really suspect anything sneaky is happening. The massages are done in her home and sometimes they hang out and share a meal together. I did bring it up in a joking way but we sort of laughed it off and he reminded me that it’s all done very professionally and that if I wanted to she offered to give me massages too. I’ve since moved away and we are long distance.\n\nI guess with the added distance, the idea of a close female friend having regular physical (albeit professional) contact with him makes me a little insecure. Should I raise the issue again or is this something I need to work through myself? Is it normal to feel weird about it? \n\nTLDR: boyfriend’s friend is studying to be massage therapist and wants to practice. He has been receiving regular massages from her. We are long distance now and I’m a little uncomfortable. Is this normal and I need to get over it or should I address it?",

I have no real dating experience and limited relationship experience. the first date went well, she was brushing up on my shoulder and i felt all was good. asked her out for another date a couple days later.  it went well, we held hands at the bar. we made our intentions clear, we both want a relationship. this is where it gets rough for me. her \"best friend\" is a coworker ive known for five years and dont like him. we are civil but hes very immature and a complete simp. apparently i talked too much shit about him. But after the second date we went back to her place, drank some more. made out and i spent the night. she even asked me to take my pants off to get more comfortable.. but we both agreed to not have sex. woke up had coffee, hung out for the day. i made a couple stupid comments  throughout the day, she said so were dating now? and i asked about her single fb status. not differentiating dating vs official. she was having said friend pick her up, at the end of our date i made a comment saying wouldnt it be funny if he saw me leaving when he picks you up. she didnt text me the majority of the next day then \"breaks up\" because i was moving too fast and the fact that they are close \"Clearly bothers me\". i wish i could redo it all because i really did like her. i know im glorifying her but this is my first real time dating and its a hurtin rn. luckily in my job its easy to avoid eachother. maybe its a good thing as if it didnt get brought up now, maybe it wouldda got brought up later when i was even more attached. its just brutal as i feel like she was one of the first really attractive women to show any interest in me. id love to here your input. i know its only been two dates... not the end of the world.. just a new experience to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - rushed into my first real dating experience with a attractive girl and blew it. what do i do now",

        "text": "I feel secure in my relationship. I know my boyfriend loves me. He tells me I'm beautiful and I really do feel loved by him. However, I consistently worry about my boyfriend thinking I am the most perfect girl he's ever known.  I want him to think I am the prettiest girl he's ever seen at all times. I'm a girly girl - I wear makeup, do my hair, plan my outfits everyday. I hate when he see's me without my makeup or hair done because I'm scared he'll wish he was with someone who looks different than me. He's not given me a reason to think he doesn't like the way I look. Like I said, he always says I'm pretty even when I don't have makeup on and I think I look terrible. I can't figure out why that isn't enough for me. I don't want him to think I'm just pretty, I want him to think I'm perfect, which just sounds so strange admitting. I want him to realize how good he has it with me, and I want him to really believe I'm the best.\n\nAnother example: He comes to my apartment almost everyday, and I always try to make sure every single thing is clean and spotless. If for some reason I'm behind on dishes, or it needs a little tiding up and he sees it not in a perfect, clean state I get very anxious and it messes with my entire day. I don't want him to see it not perfect, even if we were both there the night before and both caused a mess.\n\nIt does get deeper than just that though. We rarely ever argue, we get along very well I'd say. I always try to be the most perfect girlfriend I can possibly be to him - I do everything he tells me, I take very good care of him, I meal prep his meals for the week, I tidy his room/make his bed when I am there, never make him pay for every single thing we do (like when we go get food/doordash I always make sure to pay about every other time), formed a great relationship with his parents and friends, take care of him when he doesn't feel good, etc. Well, I rarely ever bring up stuff like this but last night I brought up something he said to me that I didn't really appreciate and was bothering me (doesn't matter what it was, the context still remains the same) and it caused us to bicker a little, and he said I was being too sensitive about the situation. It really turned in to a misunderstanding until he also went on to mention he doesn't like to repeat himself and sometimes he has to when I don't hear him. And he said I am a lot more level-headed than most women, but sometimes he feels like he can't talk to me about certain deep things because I freak out or cry. This bickering really wasn't as bad as it may sound, and afterwards we continued the night as normal and had a good time like usual. He just briefly said that stuff and I said a few things to him, then I suggested we drop it and move on because like I said we don't ever really argue or cause any issues. I made sure to tell him I was sorry and I understand and I'll try to work on those things (which he did not, even though I started off feeling upset to begin with). But again with the perfection thing, I want us to be perfect at all times. I don't ever want him to think I'm doing anything slightly wrong. It gives me terrible anxiety to think that there's something I could be doing that annoys him or gets him upset with me, and I wish I could fix these things immediately instead of gradually being better about them until he notices. It made me feel so bad I just want to lay in bed and not get up.\n\nI've never really directly brought this up to him before because I'm too nervous he wouldn't understand that it's become an issue I've had with myself. He has a psychology degree, but I'm not sure he would interpret this in a psychological way. I don't want this to make him think less of me.\n\nTLDR: I obsess about being the perfect girlfriend, and I want my boyfriend to see me as such. I wish I didn't obsess about being perfect all the time, and I wish there was a way I could get him to understand this.",

With that said, one thing has come up in the relationships that makes me want to ask. SEX!!!\n\nHow common is it for significant others to use sex as a means of controlling the other?\n\nScenario: Guy looks at gal. Guy gets excited at what he sees. Guy persues gal with affection and attempts foreplay. Gal turns guy down. Guy moves away from gal and feels rejected in the moment, but still cares for her and just goes about normal daily life.\n\nSame Scenario but reversed roles: This time the last line of the scenario changes to read, Gal moves away from guy and feels rejected in the moment. She then starts a 2 hour conversation with guy about why he dosen't want her. She asks why she isn't good enough, or who is he getting sex from it from if he isnt giving her sex.\n\nNow, before you rant about this being a sexist comment, I am well aware that this scenario can and does go both ways, with the rolls being reversed, and so as not to offend alternative lifestyles, despite what my personal beliefs are, as they are not relevant nor are they any ones business, I also understand that it can happen in same sex relationships as well.\n\nTL;DR: The question though, no matter what your scenario is, how do you deal, or those who have experienced it, how have you dealt, with sex as a control tactic?",

Which basically meant that I had to listen to him on everything and really work hard on improving my looks and in return he’ll take care of me in every way (we don’t live together right now but he said he’ll take care of me financially if we get married). Initially things were going great, he was helping me out with improving my looks by helping me upgrade my wardrobe and I was listening to all the advice he gave about what haircuts I could get etc. Fast forward to 2023, I’ve learnt a lot about clothing, hair and makeup that I don’t need his help anymore and right now I would say I look pretty good. The problem is that no matter how much I improve in my looks it’s never enough for my boyfriend, he says he wants me to be drop dead gorgeous but I’m no where close to that. We had a huge fight on 8th march, I went to a salon to colour my hair without his permission and he blew up over it, he said I broke his faith in me by disobeying him. I apologised and begged for another chance and he forgave me after a couple of days. We had another huge fight today. He called me when I was in the gym and he said I should leave immediately and go back home. When I asked why he said it’s not my place to ask him for a reason I have to listen blindly to what he says. I got angry and hung up. I didn’t leave and continued with my workout as usual. When I came home he called to say that this was a test to prove my loyalty and obedience to him and that I failed. That by disobeying him I was being incredibly selfish. He kept saying that I should count my stars that he took a leap of faith when he decided to start dating me when I was ugly and I am selfish for not listening to him with blind faith. I feel so guilty and think all this is my fault…..if I had just listened to him then we wouldn’t be fighting.I told my mom about these two fights and she’s saying he’s being abusive and controlling and if I continue with him this is going to get worse. \n\nTLDR; I got into a relationship with my boyfriend on the pretext that I will always listen to him, had two big fights when I disobeyed him",

It takes me like 45 minutes to drive him to work and back and I do this twice a day (since I'm taking him to and from work.) His work schedule also varies so I have to keep my plans really flexible.\n\nI think he has ADHD but he won't get tested because he can't afford it, isn't motivated enough to set up an appointment, and doesn't have a car. I suggested an online website like \"Done\" but he brushed it off cause he said it was shady. Also -- we shared a traumatic childhood but while I went to therapy, he refuses to get help. Also because of this childhood, we don't have parents or family who can help us out financially or otherwise. He always says he doesn't have the money to do stuff like therapy or ADHD evaluations and it's true, he doesn't. But like a month ago, he bought a laptop which REALLY pissed me off. I have no idea where the rest of his money is going, he doesn't go out. He does play a LOT of video games.\n\nNo matter how gentle I try to be, no matter how encouraging I try to be, I can't get him to be more responsible. It's especially difficult because I'm the younger brother.\n\nI love my brother and want to help him, but I'm already dealing with my own issues and don't want to be responsible for this anymore. I'd be okay driving him if he were actively improving his situation but that's not what's happening.\n\ntl;dr I am driving my brother to and from work because he doesn't have a car, a license, or money and I am tired of it because he's not doing anything to make his situation better.",

We both work on Wednesday so we didn’t plan anything, he just came over when he was off work. \n\nWhen we were cooking dinner he just pulled out his backpack and said “here you go, happy birthday!” And passed me a book that wasn’t wrapped and didn’t get me a card. \n\nThe book was kind of random. It wasn’t a good I had really mentioned wanting to read before. \n\nHe’s a bit low on money, but I think it would have cost a dollar to go to the dollar store and get some gift wrap… or something. \n\nI said thank you and was nice… but I always thought gift giving you sir someone down and they open their present. This is what we did on Christmas and for his birthday last year. \n\nAnyway I felt horrible. Not even because it was a random book, but because it wasn’t wrapped and there was no effort put in. \n\nHas anyone else been in this situation! Am I just being ungrateful? \n\nTldr: bf disappointed me with bday present",

Two years passed and again we somehow ran into each other by blind circumstance.. she was turning the corner and I was just there. Immediately we decided to move forward without analyzing the past.. just forgiving and forgetting.

We kept texting, being there for each other and giving emotional support to each other. Eventually her work situation that she kept lamenting got to the point where she proposed the idea for me to come and help at her job. Thinking I was somewhat adequately suited for the task I said yes and signed on. My first week was a trainwreck.. everything and I mean EVERYTHING that could have went wrong, went wrong. I was burnt out physically and emotionally going in from other jobs as well as all the texting with her which caused a buildup of anxiety as well.. to say I remotely put in 100% would be an overstatement, but I still wanted to help so that her short staffed and overworked job could have some levity. Things kept going wrong to the point where she thought I was sabotaging her job and that I was a complete inexperienced liar. She tore me a new one and then blocked me on all platforms saying we are only work acquaintances, which is funny because I met her through the profession we both share.

I felt I could have put more of myself into this, even though I started losing alot of my old self to her from the overwhelming waves of emotions that I felt every day from her. I had the wisdom to walk away but I had faith this would work and I would be able to do it right this time. I failed again and feel like a fraud and now her villain when all I wanted to do was help.

        "text": "\nWe live in a 3rd world country where the economy is fucked up. Long story short, we’ve been in a long distance relationship since 2020 and lived 4 hours from me. \n\nFrom 2020-2022 we stayed in long distance relationship, and in those years I always had to deal with her extreme needs of attention, her immature discussions and requirements and lack of trust (she got cheated on in the past), we always had some stupid discussions that doesn’t make sense for someone in their 20s, but I do love her and she loves me a lot.\n\nThe thing is, I just recently graduated college in december 2022, and she never started college or worked in her life (she’s 24), but she wanted to start studying and planned to come to the city capital where I live and some of her friends live in 2023.\n\nShe convinced me (kinda emotional pressuring me) to move from my parents place to live with her (her father will pay her expenses and i’ll help with like 30% of the rent) because she didnt want to live alone or share rooms with a stranger, even though I said I was not feeling ready to move from my parents since I just graduated college and as I said economy here is fucked up and I dont make much money.\n\nWe’re 1 month living together and I want to go back to my parents place. I’m not feeling good living a “married life” and having to pay for house expenses, I never had much money in my life and always had to work for things I wanted and after graduating college I always thought I would have more money to do things I wanted to, but I’m spending a lot living here.\n\nI talked to her and said I want to move back to my parents and she cried so much you have no idea, and I also said I think we should break up.\n\nEven though my name is not on the lease, I agreed to pay my share until the contract ends (10 months to go) since I accepted to move in with her and I respect her and her parents so I’ll have to pay my share.\n\nThe discussion lasted all day and she insisted so much in trying to stay with her for some more time so we could “try” to make it work that I ended up accepting it, and she also asked to live in the house with her for 3-4 weeks so she can get used to the fact that she’s going to live alone.\n\nShe has extreme anxiety and never knew how to do things by herself, I always had to help, sometimes I thought I was her father. Because of that, I accepted to stay here for 1 more month, because I get worried for her. She cant even get a public transport by her own without getting anxious and she needs to get it to go to college. I’m going with her in the first days so she can get used to it. \n\nI also convinced her to start using lexapro again and exercising, which shes doing, cause I think it will be good for her anxiety.\n\nIn 3-4 weeks I’ll leave since the medicine and the exercise will already had sufficient time to make her anxiety better, and then, when I move back, I will slowly make her feel used to live alone (she hates sleeping alone).\n\nI think I’m doing what I can to leave this relationship without “abandoning” her, and making her feel safe to live alone without me and be more indepedent, but I always get worried about how will she feel living alone.\n\nI need to always remind me that I’m not her father and she’s 24. She will get used to it and will not die either, right? I’m not being an asshole by leaving the house I think.\n\nPlease don’t think she’s the worst person, by any means that is true, she is actually improving in our relationship and giving me more space, trying to learn to be more independent, and she loves me a LOT and cares about me, but I think I just can’t anymore and want to live by myself and work on myself and figure what am I gonna do with my life.\n\nSorry for the long text..\n\nTL;DR: moved in with my gf bcuz of her emotional pressure and now i want to leave with 1 month living together and also break up but she has extreme anxiety and i’m worried about her if i leave her alone",

        "text": "Ok so my gf and I have dated for 6 months now. I believe she is loyal and could never imagine her cheating on me.\n\nBasically, before dating me, she had a \"friends w/ benefits\" that she would hook up with here and there. According to her, he was just a dick appointment and that's all he ever was. Eventually, she blocked him on everything except his phone number. He would always routinely text her every now and then asking her out and she would ghost him. Once we started dating, he still kept doing it, and she showed me and we would laugh about it together.\n\nBut then, he texts her again and congratulates her for graduating. She responds politely saying thanks and he basically continues the convo asking about her life and what she is doing now. She responds in a friendly manner, but doesn't engage him or ask questions. She even sent screenshots of it and we just laughed at how desperate he was.\n\nWell, me and her were hanging out and I asked about the texts. She showed me the rest of the convo and he basically asks her and her friends out to go clubbing with him and his friends. And she responds saying \"I have dinner plans this weekend.\"\n\nI was a bit angry at her because she didn't mention me at all when rejecting him. I was upset that the way she rejected him didn't end it once and for all - **it gave him room to hit her up again on a weekend that she \"was free\". She told me that all that matters is she said no and rejected him**. And offered to block him. But I was still upset. **It feels disrespectful considering they have had a past together and it is so obvious he wants to get in her pants again.** She could've easily just said \"No I'm not interested\" to end it once and for all, but when she says \"this weekend\", it is clearly indicate she might be free another time.\n\n**How do I resolve this? I know girls don't like to mention having a boyfriend when being asked out, as a lot of the times, guys just don't care. But this guy has been so persistent - I would think it would be time to mention the boyfriend. And I guess he asked her AND her friends out, which makes it less bad. But it still feels wrong. Any advice?**\n\n&gt;  \nTLDR: Gf's prior \"friends with benefits\" that has been persistent in trying to get back with her asked her and her friends out to go clubbing with him and his friends. Gf says \"I have dinner plans this weekend\", leaving possibility and hope for him to ask her out again another time. She didn't even bother shutting it down once and for all or mentioning me. I'm really upset and not sure how to resolve.",

        "text": "Very weird thing happened on Saturday just gone. Would really like some external input. Already mentioned it to my therapist.\n\nIt was my 35th birthday at the weekend, so I booked a nice hotel/Spa getaway for the night. All was going well - got the hotel, unpacked, went down to the pool area. Had a nice session in the steam room, then went out to the jacuzzi.\n\nThere was a couple (?) there, a young guy and girl, late teens or early 20s. I go and sit next to my fiancé, they are on the other side. The guy gets out, so I swim over to where he was and am now opposite fiancé and the girl is still there.\n\nThe guy comes back with a mobile phone and starts taking photos of the girl, who has stood up and started posing. I feel very uncomfortable and pissed off that some guy is taking photos right in front of us. He keeps passing the phone back and forth to the girl right in front of my face, then squatting to take photos again.\n\nI am sort of alternatively staring in disbelief, concern the phone will be dropped and generally glazed over staring off into space waiting for him to leave. Can I also point out I am incredibly short-sighted and often stare off into space without focusing on anything in particular (the reason I swam over to the other side was actually to read a sign on the jacuzzi).\n\nThey both get out, and I say to my fiancé 'how fucking rude was that, who takes photos in a spa like that', and he is claiming now I was the rude one as I was staring in the guy's direction and even implying I was ogling him.\n\nHe's been jealous in the past, but this has kind of sparked a row like we've never had before. That night, when we got back, we were both a bit tipsy and he called me a c*nt/crazy b!tch amongst other things, which should be unacceptable in themselves.\n\nHowever he's acting super weird now and calling me manipulative/narcissistic/socially oblivious, and basically naive. My opinion is that you shouldn't bring a phone into a spa where people are semi-dressed, or at least ask permission to take photos near them. His opinion is that I shouldn't always expect people to do the right thing, and I'm basically lacking common sense. Then it devolved into an argument about how I'm a radical feminist who doesn't understand reality.\n\nI'm just trying to understand where this whole thing has come from. Surely the correct response should have been 'yeh what a weird guy'.\n\nHe also accused me of not supporting him to stop drinking when I know he gets unreasonable when he drinks, and that I am manipulating him by playing the victim.\n\nI know in my heart that our values are probably not compatible, but the way this thing has played out is baffling to me. He really thinks he's in the right here and I was the weirdo for staring.\n\n---\nTL;DR - strange argument came out of nowhere, has dug up a lot of past resentments around jealousy and such.",

        "text": "TL/DR girlfriend of over 2 years won’t clean up her stuff after moving in together. \n\n\nI (25M) have been dating my current girlfriend (24F) for over 2 years now. We moved in with each other last July and ever since it has been an absolute battle to get her to clean up after herself. Her laundry hampers will sit in the closet/ bedroom for weeks unless I decide to put her clothes away myself. When I try to bring it up to her it always seems to turn into a fight because I quote “don’t understand how busy she is and cleaning is the least of her problems”. She’s currently finishing a university degree and works twice a week so I understand she’s busy. I just don’t know how much longer I can put up with the constant mess. She has 4-5 hours of down time to watch tv and play on her pc each day so I’m starting to feel taken for granted when I get home from work and decide to clean some of her things up. I just have a bit of ocd with cleaning and if it’s been there for a week it needs to be taken care of I think. Our closets and personal items look night and day for organization. It’s getting to the point where if I want to have any company I have a good 5 hours of tidying in front of me to make it feel decent enough to host. \n\nIf anyone’s been in a similar situation please share your feedback. I currently work 14 days on 7 days off and come home to a disaster every time. I don’t know how much longer I can put up with it. Cheers everyone.",

I started to distance myself but he kept on persuading me that we can make everything alright. \nWe both were struggling in career and we're each others shoulder to cry on. After four years we were in same city again but from there our relationship started falling apart. I broke up multiple times but kept patching up after seeing him devastated and crying. Once again I got job far away and moved again. Long distance kept on going. We kept breaking up and patching up. \nBut somehow I fell out of love. I was with him due to guilt because I thought I was with him for long. He kept falling deeper and deeper and it was totally opposite for me. \nEight months ago we broke up again due to some silly reason and because of my resentment towards him or relationship I said yes to a marriage proposal to someone else. Now preparation for my marriage is going on and I got to know that he still is not moving on and is devastated.\nNow I feel horrible but I can't go back again. I closed that return door for me. He is having suicidal thoughts, I tried to make hime understand that he needs to move on but he says that love is commitment and I spoiled him for life. \nI feel like I am the worst person in whole wide world. For a moment I became so selfish that I seeked a better relationship somewhere else. But since my anger is diminishing I am regretting my decision but my marriage is less than a month now and I can't back out as it will affect a lot of people. I can't enjoy my life. Everything is great in this new relationship but I feel like I don't deserve all this while he is suffering. I am unable to sleep. I feel this constant weight on my chest.\n\ntl;dr: What should I do now? Anyone please help I can't think straight.🙏",

        "text": "My sister is 6 months pregnant and I’ve come to visit her and my mom for a couple of days. She’s still in high school, doesn’t have a job, and is living our mom (who also doesn’t have a job either). The thing is, my sister has paid no mind to all of these concerns. It’s important to note that my sister’s boyfriend (the father of her baby) is deceased. She swears up and down she’s fine and has received little counseling on it. I find it best to comfort her when I see her rather than lecture her.\n\nI’ve been patient with my sister, I really have. She loves to talk about all the cute things about a baby, so I go along with it. That was until we went to the store. She wanted to buy a baby stroller. We got to the cashier, and her card declined. When she checked her account, there was $93 in it. 93 bucks. And she was laughing. That about did it for me. I bought the stroller and kept composure until we went outside. I told her that she needed to get real and have a plan down because there will be a baby here pretty soon. She started crying and hasn’t spoken to me since.\n\nI admit, I was harsh, and there was definitely a better way to go about this, but what I told her was real. I would be more than happy to sit down and make a plan for her on how to balance a job, childcare, and school, but whenever I bring it up, she steers away from the subject. How can I talk to her about this without her getting upset?\n\ntl;dr: sister is pregnant and did not have enough money to buy a stroller. she is in highschool and doesn't have a job. i yelled at her and now she won't talk to me.",

        "text": "Before I get attacked, I wanna say that I know ultimatums are toxic. I was always VERY against them and ironically here I am..thinking of proposing one.\n\nTL;DR! This is kinda a continuation form my last post. You dont need to read it, basically my bf was having sex with his friend while we were at the \"talking stage\". And he told me that he slept with her ONLY once and then felt like he was cheating on me. And never did it since. Turns out it was all a lie. He was sleeping with her for a month and I find out because he hearted one of her photos on fb. (he didnt cheat on me since it happened during the talking stage. and they are in different countries, plus shes in a relationship) He met up with her once recently to tell her to cut communication because he's in a relationship and feels bad (at least thats smth)\n\nThe new piece of information, is that he told me a couple days ago that...while we were together, they were jokingly saying how it would be if she moved to the country he's living now and how they'd be together as a couple. To me that is cheating. I know for some its not. But he literally entertained the idea of being with her and never mentioned that I exist:)\n\nHe is my very first relationship and im really struggling to let him go. I just cant. I tried, and I always end up going back. So I decided instead of acting immaturely to just suck it up (since I cant leave) and stay until I can no longer take it. cause only then I'll be able to leave and never look back.\n\nI thought of proposing an ultimatum. I want her out completely, (not that she did smth wrong, its 1000% his fault) I just find it very disrespectful to hang out with someone you were fucking while lying to me AND entertaining the idea of being together. I dont want him to unfriend/block her. Just no dms (which is already happening) and no meeting from close. Thing is, theyre in the same friend group. so thats like im taking him away from his friends which I absolutely HATE. \n\nI hate acting like the insecure girl. I am generally very laid back. I dont care if he hangs out with female friends alone, I trusted him BLINDLY. But now...I cant.\n\nIs this a very stupid thing to do you think?",

        "text": "Tl;Dr: Should I reach out to my long distance ex because I’ll be in his city this week?\n\nI ended a long distance relationship in October and I took it really hard. Like over dramatic teenager level heartbreak. I (34f) broke up with him (33m) because things weren’t progressing as quickly as I wanted them to and I wasn’t sure he’d ever be ready for the level of commitment I was looking for. I didn’t realize how deeply I loved him until it was over. I was maybe the most depressed I’ve ever been but I’d finally started to feel ok again within the last month. \n\nI’m visiting my best friend in his city this weekend for the first time since the breakup and all the emotions are back. I had a lot of bad memories there before I met him, but now going just feels unbearable. Yesterday it really sunk in that he doesn’t want to get back together and I’m back to crying every time I think about him. Which is often because I’m packing and getting ready for my trip and I can’t think about it without thinking about him.\n\nI think part of the reason prepping for this trip is so hard is because I know it will be the final nail in the coffin. It’s one thing for him to ignore me when I’m on the other side of the country, but when I’m in his city, with our mutual best friend, I can’t pretend he still wants me anymore. Any little glimmer of hope for us will be gone and I’ll have to accept that it’s really over. I don’t want it to be over. If I’m being honest, even writing this post now is just a desperate attempt to get his attention even though the chances of him being on this sub are slim to none. \n\nI caved a few weeks ago and called leaving a message that I was coming and wanted to see him but he never responded. He didn’t want the breakup so I know it’s not fair of me to expect him to take my call but the idea of being there and not seeing him is killing me. Should I try reaching out again or do I need to let it go?",

Two he’s older and wants to catch up to the rest of his friends and family that have already started families of his own. Three, when I ask him why he loves me or wants to marry me I don’t feel the genuineness in his answer. He’ll say things like “because I’m a good person I’m with a good heart”. Where as my long term bf in the past had tons of more descriptive terms. \n\nI just wanted to vent bc I don’t want to compare my old relationship to my current one but, I also don’t want to go out like a fool\n\nTLDR; my older bf just seems like he wants to rush into marriage for the idea of marriage not actually for who I am",

Still, to this day, I don’t think I’ve ever actually been in love with any of those people. \n\nI’ve only said “I love you,” to 2 people out of all the people I’ve been romantically involved with, but it felt like I was saying it just because I felt like I had to. The first time I said it because my first serious boyfriend (at the time we were both 18) said it to me first, then he asked me if I felt the same and I just said it back so I wouldn’t upset him. He ended up abusing me for 2 years so I don’t think he truly loved me if he could treat me that way.\n\nThe second time I said it to a guy (24M) I was in a situationship with, and I told him I loved him and I thought that if I told him how I felt he would stay with me, but he said he didn’t love me back and that he didn’t think he could ever love me. Eventually, things ended between us bc nothing I did was good enough to make him love me.\n\nA previous situationship/FWB ended because the guy (we were both 22 at the time) told me that he loved me and I couldn’t say it back bc I didn’t trust him, so then he ghosted me and blocked me and got a girlfriend within a week. Obviously he didn’t mean it since it was so easy to get rid of me and replace me and it confirmed my suspicions towards him.\n\nAll I want is to genuinely be in love with someone without feeling like I have to force it or be worried that they’re lying. I want to love and be loved and I still haven’t felt that. I feel so alone in that. And I feel so bitter when I see people who are in love, it just reminds me of what I’ve never had. I feel so unlovable and so lonely. \n\nI feel like I’ll never be in love. I want to feel genuinely loved so badly but all I’ve ever felt is used and mistreated. I want love that feels safe, like I’m not always in danger. But I can feel myself become more bitter and resentful towards the idea of love. I feel like it’s not meant for me. That there must be something inherent to me that is unlovable and instead people just don’t respect me. \n\nTLDR; everyone who I thought I loved and everyone who said they loved me has hurt me immensely. Now I feel like I will never genuinely be in love. How can I stop being so jaded and bitter towards love? How do remain hopeful?",

I'm a sensitive person in general. and you know, psychological problems mess up your personality traits and obviously you are stressed and you mind has very little space for more problems... and thus he has grown impatient and it seems like the issues about us brought up by me seem like \"that can wait if you will\".\n\nAlso, when I'm in a bad mood, I tend to push everyone away... he doesnt like that and at times he said things like \"i tried cheering you up okay but i cant with this\". which I didnt know had this big of an influence on me that I've been hesitating to bring issues up to him since then. I do bring them up, but his negative responses only got more frequent that I hesitate even more and end up being confused cause of all the piled up problems i had.\n\nThis is making me feel lonely. And I feel like being alone, especially avoid him. I dont avoid him, but I do think about what would happen if i did. The answer is I'd come back soon because it's a different type of pain when we're apart.\n\nIt isnt like he ignores me or doesnt want to take care of me or something. But I feel like the things I mention as 'issues' drain him. I had been worrying about this issue for a while now. and today I decided I would mention. I couldnt complete because 1. he told me he doesnt want to talk about it he's tired. 2. I wasnt sure what was going on. And I feel lonely again. I think he is like \"not you again\".\n\nAnd he had been avoiding me for some time. I was pushing him to pay attention to why this was happening while he constantly told me \"nothing is wrong with my behavior\" and eventually we argued a little and he said he'll think. and that was never brought up again. this was like a week ago i guess. you see, he got mad that I was 'accusing' him of something that wasnt true. But I know I'm sensitive to his behavioral patterns. when he acts like he is tired or gets mad, I feel like burying it in...\n\nI dont want him to force himself to talk and exhaust himself. So I made this post. I want to know how to take this into a positive direction again. How do I handle everything, make myself feel like im being listened while giving him the time and help him heal.\n\nTl;dr: My Bf acts like he doesnt want me to talk about relationship problems every two weeks. Both of us are depressed. But I dont say no to issues, i may not want to talk casually sometimes or about my own general sadness. His behavior discourages me to talk about stuff, making me feel lonely and wanting to be alone. How do I solve this.",

I apologize in advance because of how long it is, but I want to explain everything and I just need some advice on what to do with my marriage/life honestly. If anyone would take the time to read this it'd be amazing. \n\nI met my husband in the summer of 2021. At the time I was saving up money to move to Los Angeles to pursue acting. I have been in acting classes since I was 19, I've done theater since I was 11, and I've done many short films, indie films, webseries, and a few small parts on Amazon Prime. I have a good resume, training, headshots, reel, etc. Plus I have connections with former acting coaches to get decent representation in LA. I work as a spicy dancer (you know what I mean, lol) and make anywhere from $100-$600 on a weekday and $600-$2000 on a weekend. I also get to choose when I go in, when I leave, and how often I work..which is great with acting because it's a low stress job that can definitely work around my acting schedule. \n\nI've always pictured my life going one way.. living in LA, working towards my dreams, making friends, never having kids so I never have that type of responsibility, traveling a lot, etc. I'm not a very \"traditional white picket fence housewife\" type of person. Not that there's anything wrong with it, that's just never been me. I've never played house or pretended a doll was my child as a kid.. I always just pretended I was on a movie set when I was little and playing. \n\nBefore I met my husband my relationship history had always been unhealthy. I met my first boyfriend when I was 12. I was very insecure at the time and he kind of added to it, plus always made me feel like he'd rather have someone else instead. I developed an eating disorder for years because he forced me to lose weight. I had attachment issues and felt like he truly cared for me, so I stayed with him. Eventually, I didn't like him anymore, but it was to the point to where I felt like if I didn't stay with him he'd unalive himself. He had already been planning for a wedding when I graduated and my dad had already paid for it, so I felt forced into marriage. I didn't feel like I had a choice. I cried myself to sleep on our wedding night. I tried very hard to make it work for a year, but it was the worst year ever. He wouldn't work, even though he had a nice paying job working for his dad, so I had to work 50 hours a week at a newspaper, write stories and go to meetings, and do all of the housework by myself at 18 years old. I was miserable. I barely made enough money for both of us because he'd spend it all. I eventually left him, and I remember feeling so guilty because he was on his knees crying his eyes out. I hated myself for that. \n\nSoon after leaving I started dancing, moved to a bigger city, and met a new guy. I dated this guy for about two years, but we were never very close. We lived together, but we never really hung out much. He made fun of me a lot, put me down, and was also extremely controlling of what I wore and did. I eventually left him as well, after losing weight, gaining confidence, and excelling at my career a lot. \n\nThat is when I met my husband and fell completely in love. We met on the set of a film and fell for each other instantly. I wanted it to be just for that summer at first, but I kept falling harder and harder. I told myself it wouldn't work because I'd worked so hard for my dreams and I couldn't throw it away for him. He's actually an actor as well, But it turns out his dream was just to be in one thing, he doesn't have a huge drive for it like I do even though he does love it, takes jobs when they're given to him, and is obsessed with film and television like me. But he doesn't practice, or go to classes, or look for auditions every day like I do. He can't move because he has a daughter (2 now, she was 1 at the time) and the mother wouldn't allow him to move and keep visitation rights. That's why I knew we couldn't last.. but I just fell so hard for him. \n\nWhen I met him it was like we had an instant connection. We'd sit and talk for hours. When filming was over we kind of ran away together. We stayed in hotels and traveled the country. It was amazing. He introduced me to so many things. I'd never been to a bar before him just to hang out, I'd never really hung out with many people before him. I'd never drank or smoked before him. I'd never been that close to someone before him. I asked during that summer if he wanted to see his daughter many times, but he kept claiming that the mother wouldn't allow him, so I didn't push it. Now she claims that he just didn't try to until after me and him finally got serious. \n\nI know I said I wouldn't, but we became official in the fall of 2021. I just cared too much for him to let him go. We've had so many amazing moments and hes been incredibly loving, but some bad things have happened as well. In the beginning, especially throughout the summer before we were official, he kept me a complete secret. Now I know it was because he didn't was his ex (the mother of his daughter) to know about me and message me about him. Turns out he has a history of domestic violence, but according to him it was a two way street and they were both violent. He says she started the violence, but he didn't want her to tell me bad things about him. \n\nHe was first abusive toward me in September. We had a Tinder that we used together to \"explore\" together, but we both made it very clear we could only do it together. I saw where he'd messaged a girl asking her to come over while I was at work, so I got upset and he choked me. It was the first time anyone had been physically abusive toward me and I didn't know how to respond. I locked myself in the bathroom crying and he shouted at me calling me a baby, but then later that day he became very depressed, said he wanted to unalive himself, and said he felt like a monster and never wanted to do anything like that again. But he did.. \n\nHe actually choked me, pushed me, and hit me many times, but it was only hard enough to leave marks a few times. I know it sounds horrible, but we also had so many amazing moments. It was like 100 amazing moments to 1 abusive moment. He has severe anger issues as well as autism and he says he never meant to be violent, he's just been through so much and had so much built up that he couldn't help it. Plus, I'm very insecure and can be hard to deal with. Part of the reason I'm so insecure is because he kept me a secret in the beginning and because I've caught him in so many suspicious situations, like the one I mentioned above. I also had one of his ex's message me once saying he wanted to video chat her and he told her I said it was okay. When I got home I woke him up and asked him about it (however I probably wasn't very nice about it) and he woke up, threw me off the bed, punched me, choked me, and pushed me out of the apartment that I paid for. The next day he felt horrible and apologized for hours though. Sometimes the abuse would happen because I'd keep being insecure and pushing him. One time we were out at a night club and we'd parked at a parking garage. He got mad at me and left me in the city streets alone. We eventually met up at the parking garage, but still, he knows I don't know this city very well and it's a pretty dangerous city. When we got home I had to get diapers because his daughter was coming and I accidentally got the wrong diapers and he pushed me to the ground and choked me so hard. \n\nAnother reason I was very insecure is because at one point, around January of 2022, which was after he'd proposed (he proposed in December of 2021) I looked through his phone and saw he was still messaging girls on Tinder about seeing them without me. He had even messaged some on the day he had proposed and on my birthday. When I confronted him he completely broke down. He said he only did that because he was terrified because of his past relationships. He said he thought I'd end up leaving him or being awful, so he was just reacting out of fear but that he's been completely in love with me since we'd met. Since then I've never found any actual evidence of cheating or anything (and he let's me look through his phone any time now). I admit I still bring it up occasionally and it really gets to him thay I bring up something that happened over a year ago. \n\nBut like I said, the good moments outweighed the bad. He was also so, so loving to me. He made me feel amazing and like he was so in love. We had so many fun times, fun adventures, everything. Everyone thought we were perfect. The abuse died down and pretty much stopped by around March of 2022 and we got married in July of 2022. We both said our own vows and we both cried so hard. I know he couldn't have faked those tears, I've seen him try to in acting. He was so happy. \n\nBut we got his daughter the night of our wedding, he didn't even try to wait until the next day. I was the one who woke up with her then and a lot at the beginning because he's very grouchy when he wakes up and would usually make little comments about me needing him because I'm awful with kids, even if I'd worked until 7 am and she woke up at 8:30. He said he didn't mean it and only says it because he's grouchy in the mornings and thay I should just wake him up anyway and ignore him. \n\nHe became abusive again a few days after we got married, but only occasionally. One day he called my mom and told her, no idea why. He was drunk and said he thought she needed to know. Obviously, my mom didn't react well to that and got very angry at him, which he claims is wrong. He thinks that since he told her he was trying to get better that she should have been understanding about it. Any time I'd bring it up and how hurt I was, he would make it about him and how horrible he felt. He said me bringing it up just made him feel worse and didn't give him a chance to stay. We started fighting a lot around October 2022 because of this and I eventually decided to leave. When I left he cried harder than anyone I'd ever seen in my life. He said I was his soulmate and he'd do anything to prove he can be better. I came back after two days because I couldn't even sleep I was so upset and crying 24/7. \n\nAfter I came back he was perfect. Absolutely perfect. In November and December things were amazing between us all around. Then we were at his mom's for New Years and at one point I asked him if he thought I was pretty (no real reason, I just still get insecure over everything) and he blew up. He wasn't abusive physically, but he screamed at both me and his mom for hours and refused to calm down. After that he was sort of in his old patterns, but not for long. He was abusive maybe two times after that, and I admit I actually fought back those times. One time he had me pinned down with his hand over my mouth. I was scared, so I bit his finger soooo hard. The next day he did the same as usual and apologized and cried, but he also kept making a big deal out of his finger and saying it hurt. I felt guilty. Then another time he said he thought I was about to headbutt him (I wasn't), so he headbutt me first and he did it HARD. I felt like my nose was broken, my lip was busted, and I ended up with a black eye from it. I got drunk a few days later and apparently started hitting him out of anger. That's so unlike me, I've never been a violent person at all. I don't know what came over me, I guess I was just sick of being a punching bag, but it's still no excuse. So now I feel like I'm no better than he is and he always brings up that I'm abusive too. \n\nIn late January I fell asleep before he did and woke up to him standing outside. I could hear him talking to someone, so I went outside and asked who he was talking to. He said no one, so I asked to see his phone and he was on omegle with some random girl. All I did was say \"huh\" and walk back in because it was late and I didn't feel like fighting, but he followed me inside and threw me and choked me. He says he did that because I said \"huh\" like a b**ch and he was drunk. He later told me that he was going to come inside and tell me he was on omegle, he just wanted to be inside first because he didn't want us to fight outside the apartment. He says he was just talking to random people about how much he loves me, which I know sounds like a lie, but he swore on everything and still stands by that 100%. \n\nThe only other instances of abuse recently happened last week. On Thursday he was saying that him having autism automatically made him mentally ret**ded and I was trying to explain to him that wasn't true and that you can have autism and not be, it depends on the IQ. He just would not believe me and said he had his own opinion, but it wasn't an opinion based things, it was a fact, so I was trying to show him proof and he ended up choking me lightly and somehow leaving scratches on my face. Then on Saturday we got into a slight argument and he threw me down and pinned me to the ground so hard. This time was in front of his daughter, which almost made me leave him, but then he pointed out that she didn't understand what happened and that she was happy and smiling. Afterward he was on the couch all depressed saying that if I leave it wouldn't surprise him because his own father left him, his mom almost put him up for adoption when he was little, he was bullied all throughout school, and nothing good has ever happened to him. \n\nAnother issue I have that I feel very guilty about is his daughter. We do get her 10-13 days a month now. She's amazing and she adores me. I get along well with her mother as well. But I never really wanted the responsibility of being a parent or even step-parent. I do love her, but sometimes I find myself dreading when she's coming over because it's very difficult to do anything besides care for her when she's here. She is a sweetheart, but also very spoiled. I know it's normal for a two year old, so I never get mad at her, it's just a lot. Like, once I wouldn't let her play in the closet and she cried for an hour straight. Another time I gave her Hershey's and she cried because she wanted Santa shaped chocolate. She doesn't just cry for a minute, it's always at least half an hour. He keeps trying to give me parenting advice, like saying that I need to discipline her or use a deeper tone, but when I try she just laughs. We also have to plan things around the times we have her, so it can be difficult booking acting jobs sometimes, but usually the mother works around it with us. We do have to pay her $500 a month though in child support, but that's understandable. But I'm just not great at this. I never thought I'd have to be. Am I really so awful that 10 days a month stresses me out this much? He's even talked about us having our own kids and he can't understand why I never want to, but I don't. He keeps saying that it's crazy to let your family end with you and that it's amazing to know you created a human being, but I literally have zero desire for that. He has been better about getting up with her when she wakes up after I've worked until 7 am, but he usually takes a nap after I wake up until I'm about to leave. But the waking up so early after working so late was the main issue I had. It rarely happens now, but it does sometimes because he tends to get sick often. I know it's real though because he throws up repeatedly. I also want to mention that I've two hours away from my work so he could be closer to her, so now I drive 4 hours on the nights I work and I already have back issues, so my back constantly kills me. \n\nI've also realized how exhausted I always am now, and I know I can't blame him, but he has very little motivation. The traveling has slowed down a lot and honestly all he really likes to do is sit on the couch, play games, and watch TV. We do go on dates at least once a week or so though. He says just being home and being happy with me is enough. I agree it's amazing, but I still have that sense of adventure as well. My work ethic has gone down a lot as well. I know it's my fault, but I used to do like 5 auditions a week, but now I only do around 1 if that. I barely even take classes anymore. I hate that. Any time I bring it up he says I'm trying to do too much and I should take it slow.  \n\nBut despite all of this, I've never felt this genuinely loved and cared for. I've never loved someone the way I love him. He's my best friend and I don't think I could imagine my life without him in it. He's my rock when I feel insecure, he makes me laugh every day, he compliments me every day, he massages me, he's absolutely amazing. I am a smart girl, so I know how crazy that sounds with everything else. But I truly feel like he's just hurt and been throughba lot, plus I know I'm hard to be with. He does make me feel loves though, especially lately. He won't even let me get up to get myself a drink or snack, he always does it for me. He's been getting into religion as well. I'm not religious, but I'm glad he has something like that he believes in. He always says how he feels like a waste of space, how he hates himself for what he's done to me, how he's scared I'm going to leave, etc. He tells everyone how much he adores me, he posts me all over his social media, and his friends and family all say I'm the best thing that's ever happened to him. \n\nI just don't know what to do. A part of me feels like I'll always wonder \"what if\" because I can't move to LA or travel like I'd like. I still follow my career, it's just much harder in the state I'm in now. But at the same time, I know I'm in love with him and I know how much he loves me. He makes it so obvious, not just to me but to everyone. I feel so guilty for feeling this way, but I can't help but feel like I want to leave. I know how much I'd miss him though, he's literally my only real friend. I've never felt this way about anyone. I also feel like if I leave I'm probably going to ruin his life. He doesn't have a job (mostly because he doesn't have a license and I wouldn't be able to always drive him to work, plus on nights I work and we have his daughter someone has to be there, plus he had one at one point and called in sick the second day and lost it), he doesn't have a license, and I don't know how he'd support himself without me. I feel like I'd basically be signing his death sentence. He really seems to be so in love, he's even said many times that if I ever left he'd just be alone forever. \n\nTl;dr I really need advice on what to do about my relationship.",

We both experienced life during undergrad together and learned/grew together. We both have the same goals of being with each other and growing old together. \n\nHowever, there is this small fear in me that since we never dated anyone prior, we don’t know if we are holding each other back from meeting the right person. We both agreed that we may have been blinded with love but willing to work things out. We both mutually agreed to go on a 4 month break to have time for ourselves and experience life apart before getting married. \n\nWe both made a contract stating the rules, guidelines, and expectations. \n\nWe spent the last year doing long distance since he’s stationed in a different state and I’m still finishing my doctoral program. Being physically apart has given us time to be away since we practically smothered each other during undergrad. We just felt like we were holding each other back from having fun while away. \n\nIs going on break to “explore” other people a bad idea considering we were together for 4 almost 5 whole years? \n\nHow do I know he’s the right one? What signs should I be looking for?\n\nTL;DR \nBeen in a serious 4+ year relationship without dating anyone first. We want to be with each other in the end but decided to take a break to get the fun out of our system before making a life commitment (marriage). \n\nIs this break a bad idea?

        "text": "\nI’d like to start off by saying that everything I’m about to explain happened 2-3 years ago. I’m not proud of some of the things I did but I can’t change the past and I’ve matured a lot since then. \n\nIn 2020,  I met a guy  online. I was 17 and he was 24.  We both lived in different countries (he was a European). He was a paramedic and I was still in High school.  We immediately hit it off and we talked 24/7 for 4 months. I had never dated anyone before. He was the first guy I ever truly cared for and he made me feel loved. After 4 months of talking (we never dated), I found out he was in a long distance relationship with an American. She was 31. \n\nI didn’t take it well. I accused him of using me which he replied to by sending me all the nudes she had sent him and telling me that he didn’t need me.  He also started posting her on his story with captions like “stop looking at her smile B” and showing off all the gifts he was sending her. \n\nI didn’t block him but I stopped talking to him. Instead of moving on, I acted like I was perfectly fine to show him that I didn’t care. \n\nA few months after, I decided to contact his girlfriend to let her know that this guy was talking to me and flirting with me while they were dating. This backfired on me because she thought I was jealous of her and she told me to go kill myself. \n\nFew months later, fake accounts started adding me on Snapchat. All of them were made to insult me. I don’t have any enemies in real life and I barely have any friends. I can’t confirm that it was him or his girlfriend, but I think it was.\n\nI am now turning 21 soon and I regularly think about this whole situation. I’ve never talked about it with anyone because I’m embarrassed. I don’t like admitting that I loved someone that I’ve never met and that I only talked to for a few months. I know I am pathetic but how do I move on from this. \n\nTldr; I can’t move on and it’s been 3 years.",
