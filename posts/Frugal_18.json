        "text": " \n\nHere they go again with a new conspiracy to undermine, if not completely kill Medicare and Social Security. Mike Pence recently gave a secretive speech in which he outlined the same scheme George Bush enunciated but was forced to abandon when the wheels fell off his proposal. \n\nIt seems Pence is now conspiring with the likes of Steve Scalise, Rick Scott, Josh Hawley and a raft of Congressional Representatives who are owned by Wall Street to *disembowel the system.* \n\nThe scheme is to allow future Social Security recipients to invest 2% of their money in the stock market. 2% doesn’t sound like much, but when considered over the broad expanse of Social Security system the withdrawal of that much money would certainly sink the program. \n\nYes, at first blush it all seems good. And it would be if each future senior citizen was astute enough to hitch a ride on a rising market while bypassing a falling market; but what are the odds? One single major dip in the market could wipe out all gains in a heartbeat, and you would still have to pay fees on each purchase and sale to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. \n\nThe Market doesn’t care if you win, or lose, you pay both ways! That’s why they are underwriting the plot with millions invested in the contrivance.  \n\nAhh, but it doesn’t stop here. Last June, the Republican Study Committee, of which Scalise is a member, released a budget plan that included numerous suggested reforms for Medicare and Social Security, including raising the eligibility ages for each program to 67 and 70, respectively. The proposal further called for *withholding* *payments* for individuals who retire early or had a certain level of income, (your savings, investments and 401k) and also suggested using private funding sources to replace Medicare. \n\n“Private funding sources” means private health insurance! You remember private healthcare: “Sorry, that’s a pre-existing condition.” \n\nAs mentioned, Bush killed his plan because the market hit a downturn and lost over twenty-five percent and seniors gasped when they realized how much they would have lost from their benefits. \n\nEys wide open folks and remember the adage, “If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",

Do people use a fresh towel daily or ???\n\nPlastic bottles -- bad for the planet and the wallet?   I recently switched back to bar soap for my master bathroom.

So much light is let through that it really makes the plywood floor look crappy and old. I think the wood is in good shape it is just water stained and dirty. I'd like to scrub it this summer and let it dry in hot weather and then maybe refinish the surface to make the color look uniform again. Any tips on refinishing old plywood and removing the water stains?",
