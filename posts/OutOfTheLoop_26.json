A few questions that I cant seem to find answers to are:\n\nDid the government own this balloon? \n\nThe balloon is really big and had something attached to it, there were no people in it, right?\n\nWhy was it shot down? On principle? Or out of safety?\n\nWhy did we let the balloon travel for so long before taking it down since we decided to?\n\nMaybe most important of all, why is all the media around me consumed by an expensive balloon? I am I missing something?",

Budd Dwyer’s face as a meme template. Elon Musk’s face photoshopped onto Budd Dwyer’s body. On tumblr at least, a lot of these posts are tagged “dwyerposting” or something similar, but there’s no context anywhere in those tags. I’ve never seen this happen before on any other year. \n\nExamples [here](https://imgur.com/a/I000GNX). This is just a small sampling I found in like five minutes.\n\nI feel like I’m losing my mind. Every few days or so, I’ll cross some random Budd Dwyer post. It’s broken tumblr containment and now I find them on Twitter and stuff. Only a handful of my friends know what I’m talking about.",
