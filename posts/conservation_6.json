I want to translate that passion into wildlife/ environmental conservation photography. I know this is a very competitive sector of the industry and im willing to work on my skills and networking with volunteer work, etc. Even if that means I have to be a seasonal server in the restaurant industry for more money because I have experience there too. \n\nSo my main question is do you think it's necessary to get a degree in biology or geology to gain better understanding of the work I want to do or would that be a waste of time and money? If specific classes or programs would be a more sufficient use of my time while still getting better education, let me know. \n\nAny input is appreciated. Thank you!",

Their huge thick beams actually take longer to burn where some steel structures melt and buckle. (Think 9/11.) \n\nBut I'm concerned about the environmental implications of supplying all this timber. Has anyone looked into it lately? I seem to find some CLT pushers minimizing the potential harm to the world environment if it became a building standard - and other environmentalists panicking about the extra demand for wood and what it might mean for the world's forests?",
