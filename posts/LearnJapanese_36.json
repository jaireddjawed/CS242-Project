        "text": "Hello, so in Japanese I can more or less describe an occasion or something that happened in a given moment. Things get a little bit tricky for me when I need to string a series of events together, but I think I can still get by ok. What really trips me up for some reason, is verbally telling a story with any kind of he said/she said dialogue in it. Particularly dialogue that might be somewhat ‚Äúin the heat of the moment‚Äù and not just a simple A said B said.\n\nThe following paragraph is how I would typically describe an exchange (or more like debate) in English.  But if I tried to convey in Japanese the same cadence of feelings or tensions that occurred during the exchange, my brain defaults to some robot sounding mess.\n\nMe (in casual English):\nYesterday we had a conversation about money. I told her it‚Äôs better to stay where we are and save, but then she was like ‚Äúwe need our own space because we have no privacy here!‚Äù\nThen I said ‚ÄúI understand what you mean but we only need to stay for six more months‚Äù but she didn‚Äôt really wanna hear it and just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stressed, I don‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore.‚Äù\n\nMe (in casual Japanese):\nA„ÅØ_____„Å®Ë®Ä„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ\n„Åù„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅB„ÅØ_____„Å®Ë®Ä„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ\n„Åù„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅA„ÅØ_____„Å®Ë®Ä„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ\n(Some broken mess that ends up sounding very textbook and stuttery, and actually not very casual I think)\n\nAre there any guides or books out there that might focus on learning this sort of casual or very loose way of ‚Äúdialogue-heavy storytelling‚Äù (for lack of a better term)? Any insight would be immensely helpful. I feel like this is really keeping me from reaching that next level. Thank you for reading.üôè",

However, as I started with learning Kanjis I am really struggling to put all the things together. \n\nAt the one hand, I just want to learn new vocabulary. On the other hand, I also want to be able to read easy texts as well. For reading, I obviously need Kanjis. \n\nI tried to learn Kanjis with the iOS app Kanji! that have categorized the relevant Kanjis in the JLPT categories (N5 up to N1). I also tried to learn with WaniKani. At the end, the main problem for me is to learn the vocabulary, the Kanji, and the different readings all at once. I didn‚Äôt figured out a routine for me that works quite well.\n\nDo you have a good routine for learning that part in a more intuitive way? I guess, the main goal would be to learn Kanjis mainly by reading texts and just learn all the unknown Kanjis. But for that I obviously need a lot of basic Kanjis in the first place. \n\nI tried to find some recommendations by googling but without any satisfying results. I hope some of you have interesting routines, especially for the early phase.\n\nAlready thanks a lot üôè",

For those interested, I applied it to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DryV3xN-M0), here's the [transcription](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X2gkXU5BXmFpYtdLbgROxXCvfjTFqsjO) (I added [spaced kanji](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12cxNxo3I1a0PIU4L-X43dVnZmEvcCvux), [spaced hiragana](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5mzMe8aYgyh_mQuP2uvAieN5SYHJR58) and [roumaji](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kKO7Rihq-7ESRPLf7SY2L0aZy_c7LYRe) captions for those who can't fluently read \"real\" Japanese yet. This adds additional errors, please only use this for practicing listening comprehension together with the audio, NOT for isolated reading practice. You can get the roumaji captions also from google translate).\n\nWhisper has been [posted here already](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/xljc3e/whisper_a_new_free_ai_model_from_openai_that_can/), but only with the option of using it via google colab. The interface of the site above is better for casual use. I got this website from [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33663486), in case you are interested in some technical details. I think this is a generous offer from the creator, this probably won't be around forever as it costs money...\n\nLast but not least: What is said in the video also applies to learning Japanese. Don't overdo it and have fun :).",

It looks like my first year of progress will only be genki 1 + 300 kanji + 1000 or so words. My learning rate hasn't been steady at all. I've gone from 1-4 lessons a week, 5-100 words a week, 0-40 kanji a week. I switched learning methods, teachers, books and websites.\n\nMy teacher has been very helpful at getting me to say basic sentences but it's annoying my vocabulary is limited. Unfortunately due to raising energy bills and food prices I have to reduce or stop my Japanese lessons to maintain the quality of life I want. \n\nI know if I had steady motivation and all the free time I could learn like 5000 words in a year but life happens. I don't know how I would learn to speak on my own though. Also I don't plan to spend more than a few hours a day on Japanese for a while.\n\nI plan to travel to Japan mid 2025 and want to be able to have basic conversations with the natives so do you think it is possible for me?",

In short, I am more of a audio-visual learner who prefers interactive learning. \n\nAs a way of solidifying what I've learned on N5, I'm planning to buy the Genki 1 workbook to practice. As I move on to N4, I just wanted to know if y'all think it would be a good idea to learn the next steps through YouTube and just buy the workbook only for practice? (Just like what I did with N5?) Or is this a bad habit and I should really get into buying the textbook too?\n\nI never used the Genki 1 textbook and am not confident yet with my Japanese, but I am also able to satisfactorily read short stories in N5 level Japanese. I feel like my staggered progress is because of my reliance on YouTube videos instead of a textbook. I don't want to pick up bad learning practices so I want to know everyone's thoughts on the matter.\n\nAm I missing out on stuff by ditching the textbooks?",

(im not a native English speaker btw)\n\nMy progress up until recently has been pretty steady and decent as i have accumulated a lot of materials over the years and i have gone through the basics many times until i finally got used to how Japanese works in general. My general routine is to go through my kanji deck and read \"something\" (usually small stories/ a couple anime episodes/ read through a VN ) for about 2 hours every day.\n\nRight now I would say that I am decent at grammar as with enough time i can make sense of the majority of sentences that i meet, my vocabulary for anything other then basic concepts however is lacking and so is my kanji as those two are interlinked. I have also encountered the problem of Rikai skimming/ Yomichan skimming thus going through text without learning much.\n\nI started learning Kanji about 6 months ago by using RTK but later found anki and started learning using the \" Kanji all in one Heisig RTK + Kondansha\" deck because it is pretty clear to use. As expected my progress was pretty good up until about 300 kanji, afterwards it slowed down and now i am at about 600 kanji and i am encountering serious issues I seemingly cannot progress, in the sense that i am relearning the same kanji day after day and keep forgetting them just as fast, therefore i am constantly having a backlog.\n\nThe strategy that i have heard most suggested is to just \"keep consuming content\" or \"keep reading\", and i have been doing this until now but I am either not noticing or just not making progress though i \"feel\" like I am not learning anything.\n\nRight now it feels like stuff is going in one ear and out the other, if you guys have any suggestions it would be very welcome and I will keep updating the post if I manage to overcome this.",

        "text": "It's been about four, five years since I've started studying Japanese and I'm starting to think I just can't get good at producing it. I feel that I've progressed quite a bit when it comes to reading; I still miss very obvious things sometimes, but I can comprehend a lot more than in the beginning. Hearing is also bad, but I don't listen as often as I should to pick up news, so that's fair. \n\nBut I just never get good at speaking, even though I do practice speaking and am currently doing it daily. Even small talk trips me up a lot; for every simple conversation I forget words and grammar points (extremely simple words and grammar points at that) all the time, and when it comes to actually speaking I cannot really make a sentence. The other day I was actually trying to say in conversation \"I haven't felt like I've progressed in Japanese very much\" and realized that, after 4ish years of study, I don't know how to say that on the spot, even though it's the kind of sentence I've seen in dialogues of Minna no Nihongo, Genki and Tobira all the time (yes, I used all of those). Why are they not internalized by now? \n\nHowever, if I heard someone saying that in Japanese, I'd probably understand it and be like \"oh, yes, of course, that's how you say it. Why didn't I think of that? I know all those grammar points and words.\" I understand that language learning will take decades of studying. English is not my first language and I know I'll never grasp all of it or sound natural, but at least I can make a post like this and tell someone my opinion about something. I don't understand why I can't at least make regular conversation in Japanese after all this time, just about day to day stuff, without forgetting how those things are said.\n\nNot to mention, sometimes I will read a sentence and understand it, but there's this overwhelming feeling that in a thousand years my brain would not form that sentence in that same, natural way. And this is something that does not change no matter how many times I study that grammar point. \n\nIt's painful, especially when I see people with a lot less years of study being able to either talk very naturally or at least make sentences that, while not completely natural-sounding, perfectly sum up their thoughts. And they do it without even preparing for that subject (I see this in class daily). They just... know how to make sentences, even if not perfectly, and I can't string words together to make a simple question. \n\nI make mistakes while talking with people in Japanese, and this should in theory be fruitful (making mistakes is important, it's better than not speaking and all that), but I don't feel like I learn from my mistakes at all. I actually wish I made more actual grammar mistakes, but I'd have to be able to form actual sentences before that. Every conversation is a different struggle in terms of subject, but it does not really get \"better\". The only times I feel like I can say something more or less worthwhile is when I repeat a sentence several times in my head, usually after having researched the grammar and words, and then say it, but I can't exactly make conversations out of this; if the person talking to me goes off-script I'm lost again. \n\nAnyone has a similar issue?",

The reception is going to be more informal at a nearby izakaya. I have met one of his friends and their girlfriend, who will be there, but haven't met most of his other friends including the friend who just got married. I was such an awkward ball of messy Japanese last time I met one of his friends and whilst my Japanese has improved a little bit since then, I wanna be able to try joining in a little more this time.\n\nI'm studying Japanese at intermediate level but if I'm honest the Japanese I can use off the top of my head (without preparation) is typically significantly more limited. So packing some ready to use phrases in my arsenal for later can only help. My boyfriend can speak perfect English and obviously can help me communicate but I don't want to have to make him a translator all evening for me üòÖ\n\nI'll let you guys know if I manage to use anything you suggest üòÇüëç\n\nTY in advance üòä",

In English there is something like the [Royal Order of Adjectives](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/the-royal-order-of-adjectives/), so the phrase \"the shiny new red car\" sounds natural, whereas \"the red new shiny car\" does not. Both convey the same meaning, but to a native speaker the latter phrase sounds a bit off, although the meaning is still 100% comprehensible.\n\nI wrote the following bit to a native speaker through HelloTalk: „Äå‰ªäÂπ¥„ÅÆÂ§è„ÅØ„ÅÇ„Åù„Åì„ÅßÔºíÊ≥äÔºìÊó•„Å´ÂΩºÂ•≥„Å®„Ç≠„É£„É≥„Éó„Çí„Åó„Å¶„Äç and she corrected this to „Äå‰ªäÂπ¥„ÅÆÂ§è„ÅØ„ÅÇ„Åù„Åì„Åß**ÂΩºÂ•≥„Å®**ÔºíÊ≥äÔºìÊó•„Å´„Ç≠„É£„É≥„Éó„Çí„Åó„Å¶„Äç, emphasis mine. It seems like it sounds more natural to order the particles like „ÅØ„ÉºÔºû„Åß„ÉºÔºû„Å®„ÉºÔºû„Å´, but I can't tell if that is just personal preference, or if such a concept as \"Royal Order of Particles\" exists in Japanese.",

        "text": "I usually don't make much research before I buy a Japanese novel. Provided reviews are good enough and the topic seems like a fit, I buy it and try and read it.\n\nBut, more often than once, I understand after a few pages (sometimes a few lines), that most dialogues of the book I started reading are written in some local Japanese dialect.\n\nI have nothing against said dialects. I am looking forward to understanding as many of them as possible. I also understand that they're not *that* different from the standard Japanese. But they're really hard to deal with at this stage of my learning process. Details matter to really understand a sentence, and at this stage it is a challenge for me to grasp \"all\" of the details even in standard Japanese. But the transposition into a dialect makes it extra-difficult to grasp.\n\nTo give you an idea of where I am talking from : I am taking JLPT N1 this December with, I'd say based on the mock exams, a 90% chance to pass it. When I read Higashino Keigo's novels I use the dictionary mostly to check readings (in preparation of said JLPT). I can read 3000 kanji. But just yesterday, I started reading Â≠§Áãº„ÅÆË°Ä, by ÊüöÊúàË£ïÂ≠ê, and it's loaded with Hiroshima dialect. I understand the gist of it, but it is frustrating not to understand the details, the nuances, of it. \n\nSo I start wondering if I should give up this book for now, give it a chance later. Or is it worth it struggling through it? Another example of such an experience is Á¥∞Èõ™ by Ë∞∑Â¥éÊΩ§‰∏ÄÈÉé. I gave up after a couple of pages, because it is a classic, I didn't want to waste it. Yet another example is ÁÅ´Ëä±. I read that one through, but I wonder how much I missed in the process.\n\nI don't live in Japan (although, I would love to), so all dialects are equally intereresting or uninteresting to me. To me, books are a path to Japanese. Dialects are an oddity in those books. I'm wondering if I should face this oddity or avoid it. But/and I have found no easy way to avoid it except after the fact.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* Do you know good resources to lookup words, expressions, or grammatical alterations of various regional dialects?\n* Did you, in your learning process, dig into dialects? And did that grant you any benefit regarding a better understanding of Japanese as a whole?\n* Do you know any \"reviewer\" of novels/books who explicitely mentions whether or not any dialect is heavily present in a book?\n* Do you have any thoughts about how, in your own experience, being in touch with dialects interacted positively or negatively with the general goal of becoming fluent in Japanese?\n\nThanks.",

I bought RTK when I first started learning Japanese but I found it to be a bit boring compared to WaniKani and and I'm not in any major rush to learn Japanese (hoping to be somewhat fluent in 2 years hopefully), I'd like to go to University in Kyoto when I'm older (I just turned 15 today) but my Kanji are severely lacking compared to the rest of my Japanese (in my opinion) and I'm not sure how necessary writing would be. I know WaniKani doesn't teach writing but I find their system so much more interesting than RTK, as well as being able to learn new vocabulary to help me as well! However since I'm only 15, I'd be spending the majority of my birthday money on WaniKani and I was just weighing up the pros and cons. I think I'd be able to learn how to write the majority of Kanji if I memorised the radicals and general stroke order but I'm not sure if this would be enough. Also I'm kinda short of time these days as I do martial arts 4 days a week, Volleyball and Table Tennis the other 2 so only have Saturday free and I do about 3 hours of Japanese (input, Anki, output) a day already so I don't know if adding WaniKani would make it too much for my schedule as I still have other hobbies like Game Design and stuff that I really enjoy. Just wondering if you think WaniKani would be the best option for (University, after learning general stroke order I could write, for time and for speed and Vocabulary as well as not taking insane amounts of time to complete per day).\nSorry for the rather long post I'm just trying to learn Japanese in the best way I can (whether that's RTK, even if I don't like the system as much, or if that's WaniKani), thanks everyone and have a great day!\nCharlie",

        "text": "I'll ask my question upfront before providing some background on myself as a learner and such: After a long pause in your learning effort how do you properly restart? I understand that for the most part it's just *insert shia lebouf just do it meme here* but I'd like to hit the ground running \"right\".\n\nBackground:\nI'm 29, been interested in Japanese for most of my life since I play so many video games made by them, watch anime, typical nerd stuff. It goes beyond just this, but it was the heart of what got me started. I started learning about a year and a half ago via Immersion learning after I discovered MattvsJapan and Refold/Migaku, my routine looked like this basically:\n\n- Wake up\n- Do Anki reviews 15-20 new cards + however many reviews\n- Watch like 4 episodes of anime with JP subs and try my best to both understand what I was hearing/reading and making the occasional card for Anki.\n- Do some purely reading using Satori Reader, do it's review cards I made while doing that.\n\nPlay video games, sleep/work, handle responsibilities, go to gym, have social life, was all mixed in there too of course, but I slotted the above everyday for months on end, not missing a day for a long long long time.\n\nI saw improvement, but it wasn't as drastic as some people have had in the same time frame (stories and such I've read on this sub and other places, but I know a lot of folks go harder than myself). I'd say this was about 9 months at least non-stop. I then took like a month off (due to burnout), before finding the passion again, where I restarted before, just trying to pick up where I left off which lasted for a shorter period (like another 3-4 months) and it's now been probably 3-4 months since then. Recently, however, a bunch of my freinds started planning a trip to japan with myself included in about 3 years time, and obviously I want to try and get to a point where I can read/talk to people while I'm there, I don't expect perfection, but I've been at this for a while and think I can get there in that time if I try, I just don't know what to do really.\n\nI've never tested myself formally, but I know I'm probably still like N5 if even (really struggle with Japanese grammar). Some very simple sentences come to me naturally, but I struggle with most and don't know probably like 95% of what I'm looking at vocab wise too (even worse now that I'm rusty again). I was decent at recalling meaning in a vacuum, but throw things in a sentence and my brain would melt (or at the minimum, I'd have no idea if I was right on the meaning or not, self learning troubles).\n\nIf you have any tips in general for someone like myself (things that helped you out of a hole like this, or similar situations) I'd appreciate them. Especially how someone using my learning method might better understand grammar, but if it is just continue to consistently expose myself to it so be it. I'd also be willing to hear out good Anki decks to use for someone in my situation.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for coming to my TED talk, feel free to leave me advice or your favorite JP subbed anime to watch for immersion learning I'll watch anything really Slice of Life to Shonen and beyond.",

While on my laptop I just use yomichan to save words immediately which is very effective of course. However if I‚Äôm on my phone or in the real world I usually save the word to my dictionary (Shirabe Jisho or Japanese) and then manually input it into Anki later. This is obviously quite time consuming. Any methods that can work around this ? It would be awesome if I could import a saved vocab list in my dictionary directly to Anki but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a thing or not :/",
