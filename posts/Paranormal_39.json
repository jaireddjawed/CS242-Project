        "text": "Back whenever the corona pandemic was still fresh a good friend of mine was due to have her baby. At that time you were only allowed one person in the delivery room and she chose me. Also at that time she stayed in a hotel room in Ardmore, Ok while I was in Durant. Well the time came unexpectedly and I had to drop everything, pack up my teen and toddler and head to her. When I got there I had to go to her in labor and get the hotel key so I could take my kids and meet her teenagers at the room so all of our kids could be there together so I could help deliver the baby. Well, we get there and the key is not unlocking the door. I get the property manager. She’s a pretty tough lady as I like to think I am too lol. She says come on I got this. We get back to the door and this is around 6pm daytime, as me and all the kids are standing there watching her we all heard someone say, she’s in labooooorrrrrr, now I knew that shit sounded like a ghost but the lady start banging on the door saying hey it’s me and I said noooo she’s not in there she is at the hospital so she says well there’s somebody in there, so she goes and gets the boss man and he had to make another key and ofcourse when we opened the door there was no one there! Sorry for the lengthy story but there’s more. It doesn’t stop there. \nSo it was a lil spooky but nothing too crazy so I get all the kids in the room and settled n head on back to help deliver the baby. Made it just in time and helped till around 1030 pm n told her I needed to go feed them dinner n that I would be back. So I go back to the room, pick up my teen and another teen and left the rest of the group in the room. Go down to the car in a well lit parking lot, about 1130 pm now. No one else is in the parking lot, I have my window down smoking a cigarette and the girls are talking in the back. I was enjoying the time about to leave when I hear 3 different woman making deep moaning sounds all at the same time and one voice was more dominant than the others, I turned to look at the girls and they both had looks of shock on their face and the whole time the sound is getting louder and I get chills all over my entire body, I hit the reverse n gas n got outta dodge, it was like something you would hear off the movies, now by this time my adrenaline was going so it took about an hour for me to calm down and head back to the room with food. We get back up n tell the girls in the room what happened to us. Immediately one of the girls mentioned a faulty light in the hotel hallway that was creepy so for some reason we all decide to step out in the hallway and look at it and when we did I seen a tall hefty dark shadow figure of a man staring right at us below the light that we were staring at, I blinked and rubbed my eyes and it was still there! Then it turned and literally walked off and all of us screamed and ran inside letting me know I wasn’t the only one seeing him. Now by this time I’m officially freaked out of this hotel. I know it’s surrounded by spirits for whatever reason now and it wasn’t good spirits, these were troubled souls for sure. Because it was scary and not a pleasant feeling. So by this time I’m super scared one, to leave the hotel by myself to go back to the hospital bc all the other experiences I was not alone, and it’s 2am by the time I need to go back to her and two, I’m scared to leave all our kids there alone, teenagers or not they are still my kids so if it was scary for me I know it was scary for them but I knew my friend and baby needed me too. So I’m standing by the door in the room trying to muster up the courage to go to my car alone and my daughter says mom play Mariah Carey, they said why, she says it helps calm her down, I said your right, I’ll just play and sing music while I RUN to the car lol well as I’m standing right next to the door, browsing through songs, all the kids in the double beds staring at me with such quiet intense to see what I pick and all of a sudden, clear as day, so loud as if they were right in the room with us I heard children giggling laughing and playing, I shouted I’m going to open this door and if I don’t see any kids playing I’m not going anywhere, and ofcourse there were no kids and I did not leave my children there alone. I felt bad for my friend at the hospital but I felt as though those lil kids did that to warn me and keep me there. The rest of the night there was knocking coming from the wall and we were the last room on the hall no one was next to us. The next morning I go to ask to change rooms and even before I can tell the property manager what happened to us they had already changed our room for us and told me that a man had been shot n murdered while he was standing at the rooms window. I wasn’t suprised one bit but after having to stay at the room myself and it was not rm 186 but only a few rooms down I still had occurrences there too. Almost died in that room and finally left. I thinks some really evil things happened there. At the time it was called boardwalk inn in Ardmore, OK but now it’s the quality inn I think, next to Burger King for sure lol incase anyone wants to try and stay Good Luck, let me know if y’all want to know what happened in the other room and how I almost died and finally got away from that hellhole.",

More recently when I looked right into that red light coming from the TV next to my bed, I saw what seemed to be a group of people standing in a circle with somebody laying in the middle, maybe on a table. Does anyone else had similar experience with things like that or could it be just a trick on the brain that creates a very real illusion?",

(Long Story Short Someone's been Working against me for over a year now and my life Is in shambles.)\nThere's no power, no heat, I have No phone, nobody to talk to, I wasn't on drugs/High, I was sleeping a lot there so I wasn't sleep deprived and Have Candles and Small LED lights. It was around the Night of the Hunters Moon. \nI had My mirror Sitting on the Floor Where I was doing my makeup Earlier and It looked like the mirror was moving as it caught my eye....Then I seen it wasn't the MIRROR but it was it's reflection moving. It was moving slowly Over and Up until My face Was Shown In the Frame. I was like WTF... So I moved to the other side of the bed and it did it AGAIN. I got down on the floor And Sat Upright So My face wasn't in frame and it did it again. It would Move Slightly until My face was in The frames reflection and Then Stop. No Shadows, No Change to my reflection or the reflection itself. Tried touching the Reflection as if I would go into it. But nothing. I sat there for a while and nothing happened. A few minutes. Later I got back up on the bed and It did it again but Still nothing would happen. I don't remember if it was the next night or a few nights later the Hunters Moon when I woke up to a Loud Thump as if A Huge Loud Furnace Kicked On A few Houses Down and then after a few Seconds, The same Sound Only closer like A furnace At the next house, then the next one, closer And closer until it hit The house I was in. As soon as it did I heard One Of my roommates upstairs Get up and take 2-3 steps but Then nothing. I was sitting up, not dreaming, locked the door and Sat and listened for anything....No movement or Noise and it didn't Move to any other houses...I finally fell back asleep and the door was Locked still when I got up so It couldn't of been a dream. (I can tell the difference anyways.)",

        "text": "I'm not sure if this counts, but it was a beautiful moment that happened last year and I wanted to share it. Could be coincidental, but I find it comforting to know that he was at peace and he got his wish for snow in rural Alabama—and lots of it. Bear with me, because there's some backstory to this.\n\nMy great uncle, Jearle, was a retired veteran and firefighter. I didn't know much about him, but I know that he was a very sweet man with a big heart and even bigger anxiety. Our family on his side, however, isn't all that way and unfortunately he usually went to the brother and sister suppers essentially alone. The only one who would make a concerted effort to talk with him being my grandmother.\n\nThe family is very... Let's say catty, I think that's a good descriptor. They talk behind one another's back and try to start things. Word got around eventually, and my grandmother was fed up with it. She decided that she wouldn't go to the brother and sister suppers anymore. Well, once Jearle found out about this, he decided he wouldn't either.\n\nUnfortunately, this meant that he would be alone on Thanksgiving aside from his caretaker. He usually was anyways, but now... More so. So, my grandmother invited him to *our* Thanksgiving, so that he could have supper like a real family should around people who do genuinely love and cherish him.\n\nI didn't see him for a moment where he wasn't smiling, especially when he was holding my baby niece in his arms, rocking her to sleep when she was fussing for most of Thanksgivin. I got to finally know him then, and I've never met someone with a gentler heart since.\n\nWhen it was over, Grandma told me that Jearle told her that he didn't want to leave, that he had such a good time and really didn't want it to be over.\n\nHe passed away in his sleep just a week later. I'm really, truly happy he had such a nice time before he passed.\n\nNow, I live in Alabama, and one thing you should note about here, even in the Northernmost part of the state, it *rarely* snows. On Thanksgiving, it was hardly even weather enough for an overshirt, and the day before Jearle was buried that was still the case. The day of, though? I had never seen it snow harder. I think it may have been at least three inches deep, which is unheard of where we live. Especially to occur *overnight* with no warning. \n\nHell, I had never seen so much snow *stuck* on the ground! I know it may just be coincidence, but I like to imagine that was Jearle telling us from beyond that he was at peace.\n\nTL;DR Jearle had a really nice Thanksgiving before he passed, and he made sure to let us know after by making it snow when we buried him.",

        "text": "Howdy folks, hope everyone's having a good day. Just wanted to share a strange experience I had a couple of years ago in regards to a demon or shadow-figure wearing a hat after I've been reading about others' experience with something similar. I thought my experience was unique, but I am comforted, somewhat, in knowing that I am not the only person who has seen it. \n\nSo, a couple of years ago, I was given a thc edible in the form of a peanut butter &amp; chocolate cup during a barter. My friend recommended that I only eat a quarter of it, as I have not smoked or ingested any thc for several years and would have a very low tolerance to it. But I thought, \"momma didn't raise no b**ch\", so I ate the whole thing and popped on Beverly Hills Ninja and laughed until I cried. Once my body metabolized the edible and felt its initial effect, I thought I would soon come down, but as it turned out, I had a full-blown psychedelic experience that felt like it lasted an eternity. \n\nAfter a few hours of tripping, I decided I would try to sleep it off, so I lay on my back in my bed and stared up into the darkness with some ambient light coming from my digital cable box. And that's when the demons came. What I experienced could only be described as being a passenger on the \"It's a Small World\" ride in Disneyland but except for cute animatronic dolls wearing the garbs of different cultures and ethnicities, it was horrifying demons that would smile and get as close to my face as they could without ever touching me. And every once in a while, from seemingly out of nowhere, a man wearing something like a butler outfit with a top hat all void of color but darker than the dark except for its eyes and teeth, would jump into \"existence\" directly in front of me, take off its top hat, bow deeply, straighten back up, put its hat back on and then jump back out of existence, smiling all the while and unblinking. And it did this several times throughout the night and it was completely startling every time because I never expected it when it happened. \n\nThis lasted for hours until dawn when I finally came down from my trip and decided I would go eat breakfast and think about what the hell just happened. I never fell asleep that night despite the tiredness I felt from adrenaline-dumping all night from staring back at demons. They reminded me of pack predators trying to disrupt a herd to get them to break formation and run, and I was their prey. What got me through that ordeal was trying to keep calm, focus on my breathing, and keep staring back at the frightening abominations to hold my ground to some degree and to show them no fear, as I felt like feeding on fear gave them power. But that shadow person with the top hat I vividly remember the most and thought it was unusual but shrugged it off. And then I come to read about other people experiencing a similar entity (albeit through different means) and wondered what the hell exactly is that manifestation? Like, is that Death? And why would different people, under different circumstances be seeing almost the same exact entity?\n\n Anyways, apologies for the long-winded story. Just wanted to share my unusual experience. Have a great day, folks. Stay in the light and keep fighting the good fight!",

        "text": "I'm adding this to a few /r's ao I can get different types of peoples intake. Figured I'd share. Long story very short (trying to get ready for work), was depressed last night (for some time in total) wife was aware and we discussed. Suddenly developed a massive pain over my left upper jaw /cheek bone. I took medicine, but it kept very quickly growing. It got to a point where it started to feel like a car was sitting on my left side of my cheek to the point I was moaning and writhing in pain with massive changes to temperature (hot / cold). I reached a breaking point and figured as a hail Mary id tried to meditate. I have a \"mutant\" form of meditation ive developed that's allowed me to connect to my higher self, guides, past on loves (only a couple of times), and two times in the past I was able to connect to god/source (tried calling it by all names) but only ever for a very forced smile when I connected to it (like someone pulling each side of your mouth upwards.\n\nIn this moment of severe pain I called out in my meditation for him. Asked for protection with white light and instantly connected. Had the smile, but then the usual signs faded and my pain started to ....Best way I can describe, melt like ice. Felt like defrosting my matter under my skin, like cool soothing water and felt the pain drain out of me like water down a drain. Temperature settled down, felt cool. Suddenly felt comfortable and at peace. Then conversation started. At first I asked simple questions, but then tried to get cheeky and ask gotcha questions. Things I had no knowledge of and was hoping to trip who I was talking to up. No luck with that! Every answer came immediately, like an adult to a toddler. Everything was so simple. Anyway, I was typing away right after this and almost at the end during this experience. If it comes off odd, im sorry, was almost like a trance (not sure how to describe it, sorry). Recollection of the conversation felt like reading off a looping scroll? So some info repeats. \n\nFor reference Colleen is my wife, Zazu is my cat. Pasting here with no edits. Its a long read. Im sorry in advance. \n\n\n\n\nAs I grow she will grow. As I learn she will learn. Zazu has always and will always be with me. Elemental like. Biggest fan, inspiration... his champion he cheers and roots for me and guards me. Even after death wont leave my side. Hes never left and never will. Colleen is new or newer. We agreed prior for me to help her. She's proven to be very good at showing my cracks. But ultimately I'll help her. Even the phone brightness being set to low prior was planned for this moment. God is an endless circle of existence as are we. He always existed as we have. Asked who crested God..he created God. No beginning, circular. There was a past to our past,  a past to that past etc same with him. Multiple universes. Endless. Evil transplanted here from another universe (draconian) so we can go through similar learning lessons as the last universe, and the one before that etc.. they have no real power, merely a means for the lesson to exist. They are compelled by thinking they win, too blind to see they've never ultimately won anything. Can only see relatively short term not big picture. Even if they could, content with the power they have even if it means nothing at the end. Energy cannot be killed or created. Just transferred. Evil exists. There to show you the good. Allowed to exist for this purpose. But ultimately powerless to God. God will always be with me. To everyone. Trust my gut. Angels exist as an extension of God. A vehicle for his will and word. Hence messenger, not literally per say but a means for which he can speak to us in this experience. We are vehicles for which he experiences life. Through us. He goes through all the good and pain, not inflicted on us, but to him. All important. All necessary. All loved. How he grows. I'll always be connected to him. Trust my gut. Talk to him. Time for change. Ive had enough pain. Time for \"phase 2\". Time for a break from pain, asked for proof, proof being the pain he stripped from me tonight. He wants it. It happens, no effort.. The pain was intended and willed by him as a way for me to reach out to him, for all this to happen. Bad is always a meana to and end that is good. Even with free will, he ultimately gets his way as his will is already in motion. Much like evil, no ones individual actions ultimately derail his will. He commands and it will be. Ive reached a wall, which he recognizes. Akashic records are like a hdd to the computer he built that we reside in, the experience we all go through and are contained within for which he lives vicariously through us. Debbie Solaris not special. Im not special. No one is special. We all have the same gifts. Activated when intended. Activated when its time. Good and bad seeded earth. Good and bad entitles, aliens (call them what you will). Asked about Egyptians, their gods. Gsve example. Ra is a collective. Ultimately good but the downside is as a collective its essentially a hive mind with some individuality. The down side being the collective can be influenced by itself and be lead to the wrong conclusions despite best intentions. But ultimately was all pushed in the general direction it should have, per his will. Evil never ultimately wins just temporarily victories despite the direction always forward moving to an ultimate goal set by his intention. Pain and suffering for vehicles to learn and grow. Its not a punishment but a means to an end, a lesson. Death isn't what we think. We are helped in the process. While there can be pain, the end pain isn't present.  We are guided away from our plane of existence while the body is left. The body may suffer upon death but we do not. Call upon God at any time. Know good or evil but gut reaction, you always know deep down if you trust the initial feeling. He is always with us can always communicate with us, its not difficult for him. There is no barrier, there is no stress, there is no strain or burden. He can control every aspect in our universe and communicate with each and every one of us all at once without effort or strain. God doesn't leave us. God is always present. If there is no answer it is not because he is ignoring our plight but simply that he is wanting us to experience whatever it is we are experiencing for growth. Lessons, always learning as its why we are here. He lives through us. Its how he learns. Its how he grows. All one. All one. Always existed. Never not existed. Us, God, everyone. Circular. No end. No beginning. Don't live in fear even in fear. Don't live in pain even in pain. All temporary. All necessary. All planned. Its all ok. I dont need to come back. I dont need to be reincarnated on earth. He knows I dont like it. But I did agree to come here. I wanted the challenge. Every life I seem to go through the same beats, the same arch. Hes humored by this. I have a nose for bs, an internal compass for morality, a thirst for knowledge, that ultimately has always lead to me finding out what I need to find out to find him. To get to this same point. No matter how much or how little I know in the beginning of life (remembering past lives etc or not), I always figure it out. Its funny to him. Amusing. Amazing. He enjoys it, and seems almost (almost) shocked by its occurrence every time. Funny. Everything is willed. Everything is planned. We have free will within his confined playground. His rule set. His control. Politicians pawns for individual power. Some good some bad. Mostly bad. Ebb and flow to that power. With evil from this power struggle comes good. Comes walls torn down. Comes new lines drawn. Comes change. Ultimately going where it should. Details don't matter.. players don't matter. Ultimate happening to his will. Not by exact design. Again, free will, but in the direction he ultimately wants. Demons exist. Evil exists. No power at the end of the day. Little wins to a match that can't be won. Controls people via the fear they can cause in the moment. Can lead those down a bad path. But the path was intended to be bad by God for the soul to learn. So the evil which thinks its self serving is ultimately doing the will of God without knowing it. If you call on God these beings dissipate. Its all a play, we all have our \"little scripts\", if we improvise and don't follow the script its still his play, none of our improv changes the \"end\" of the play. Zazu jumped up on colleen the moment I asked about him. Came to me and cuddled when we discussed his role in my life. Asked about not having sleep tonight due to the the pain then his communication. Said it won't matter at the end of the day. I'll be fine. I'll have the energy I need to get though work day, and that it was ultimately worth the small sacrifice for this communication, no? I've always had my sense of humor. It gets me through all the pain. Motivator to continue. He has a sense of humor. Desoite all my questions. All my quips. All my gotcha questions. Hes one step ahead. Simplest answers for everything no matter how complex. Im ready. Time for change. Colleen is young. We agreed to this, prior. Here to teach her. She shows my cracks. Shows my weaknesses, im not a pro at this. But I will ultimately get her there. Its why we are together. All planned all willed. Be kinder. Be more patient. He laughs as he knows what she does to wear me down. It is who she is. I am who I am. We will grow through through this back and forth. If I give more he promises she will reciprocate. More patience, more learning. Less patience, less learning. Knows my struggle. All meant to be. All according to plan. Big changes. Its time. \n\nI've asked so much. No hesitation for any answers. On step ahead. Complex for me, simple for him. It was an absolutely life changing conversation. \n\nSevere pain in head. Like a car crushing my head. Mediated. Called out to God, source, any name for him. Focused on protecting with light. Connected at that moment. Melting. Like defrosting. Melted the pain. Never felt anything like it. Felt so good. Worst pain to 95% less pain in minutes, conversation then 5% gone over 30-60 minutes. I feel amazing. Water wasn't special. Vehicle for his will of curing my pain. All planned. Its like a joke from my perspective, one step ahead of everything. No pulling between brows like during my other connections during meditation. Yes, initially. But when the back and forth conversation happened, none. Never experienced anything like it. Initial contact forced smile like last two times. Like a calling card. Unlike last two times actual conversation. Amazing. Life changing. 1138. 1138 my number. Repeats, his way of nodding, winking, get my attention, learning moments. 11/28 pain started. 3 am communication started. Not 38 days in the month, sub 3 for the 2. All planned, almost humorous for him.",

My mother assumed it was my grandpa at the time who passed away 2 years prior. She proceeded to yell for him to leave her house and then the smoke detector turned off.",

I think the last time I saw one (or him?) was when I was in my early twenties. \n\nIt never seemed to want to cause me harm. Always just looking at me from around the corner of a wall. Or at the edge of my bed. But it would still scare me every time and I would sleep with the covers over my head (still do).\n\nI saw a Tik Tok today that reminded me about shadow people. Honestly hadn’t thought about those encounters in a long time. \n\nWhat I’m asking is other people’s experiences of when you stopped seeing them? I’m glad I don’t see them anymore but I was just wondering what causes someone to stop seeing them? \n\nThe last time I saw the shadow person was when I was in a bad relationship in my early twenties. The (bad) boyfriend at the time said he saw a shadow man standing in the corner of my apartment. \n\nBut I’ve had other bad relationships since that one and other bad times (depression, unaliving thoughts, homeless, etc..) and never saw the shadow person again. \n\nI’ve seen theories that they only come around when you have negative feelings or bad energy… but I just wonder why this shadow person didn’t come around for any other of the bad times? I used to see it all the time. \n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience? What theories does anyone have on why we suddenly stop seeing them (even in future bad times)?",

It stands outside my window at night and hides things around my room and then gives it back a few days later, shadows out of the corner of my eyes, that sorta thing. The other day my boyfriend, younger sister, and I were all in my room talking, the cat was with us. We heard a bang upstairs but just assumed our mom had woken up from her nap and dropped something. However, about an hour later my mom comes downstairs wielding 2 Tupperware container lids. These lids were on a shelf, inside bowls that hadn't been moved, and they landed under the fridge across the kitchen as if thrown. My step dad wasn't home, no one else was in the house and we only have the 1 pet. She comes downstairs wielding these lids and yells \"Look at these!\" I was like \"Ya, those are lids, what's wrong with them?\" She holds them above her head and yells \"I found these under the fridge, the bowls weren't moved.\" We stared at each other trying to figure out who couldn't done that. I asked her if that was the bang from earlier and she said she didn't know she was asleep, I told her we all thought it was her. She shakes her head at me and goes \"I'm gonna sage the house, I'm getting rid of your ghost\". My sister and I both told her she wasn't because it is cool and we kinda have fun having a ghost around and our cat gets along with it for some reason. Thanks for reading:)",

Thinking I was just seeing things I went ahead and got in my bed and pulled the blanket around me when clear as day I heard my grandpa's voice as well as warm breath as if he was blowing on my fourhead kind of between my eyes. I never felt uncomfortable or frigntened and I remember rolling over and falling right to sleep after that as if it was a feeling of pure benevolence. I could easely write this whole thing off as my imagination if it where not for my grandma talking about the same exact thing happening to her a month or so later when I was visiting her.

This was happening all in my room, until I woke up. No one was there of course. \n\n2nd encounter was a bit more paranormal, from what I think. I had this idea,where after the family reunion.  The next day, since people come from out of town and state. That we would have breakfast where i stay. I been working in the back yard.

I was a bit hung over, and suprised I woke up early.  From kinda blacking out from the drinking last night. \n\nAll I remember is ,a relative that I live with. I was woken up,by the sounds of my door opening.  And my relative, says get up. Then I feel myself falling back asleep, same thing door opens I can see my realtive looking threw the cracked open door. And I heard it like 3 or 4 times ,and all I hear is a uhhh. Like being annoyed cause I didn't get up. \nWhen I finally snapped out of it,and got up. I had a strong feeling, I was dreaming.  I asked my relative, hey did you open the door and wake me up. She told me she didn't, and she wouldn't lie like that. That's when I thought it was her mom, who passed away. I just thought since I planed the party, her mom was telling me.to get up and start setting stuff up. \nCause no one was gonna help me,it was early morning when all this happened.",

I also want to add that I never experienced anything paranormal before this and haven’t experienced anything since. About 15 years ago, while I was still in college, my parents bought and moved into a new house. As soon as I stepped into the house for the first time, I felt uneasy. I only spent my holiday breaks there, but it was enough time for me to have quite a few unexplainable events happen.\n\nFor whatever reason, the weird things only seemed to happen to women in the house. My mom was constantly losing things and having them turn up in strange places (to a point that I was starting to get worried about her). I experienced whispering voices, footsteps when I was home alone, and feeling my bed move during the night. My aunt also experienced footsteps, voices, and music while she was pet sitting for my parents.\n\nMy dad and brother never experienced anything and thought my mom and I were crazy…until one Christmas Eve. We were taking our yearly family photo in front of the Christmas tree and had a tripod set up. We had taken some photos and were all behind the tripod to see how they turned out, so we were all facing the tree. At that point, the tree started to shake violently, tipped slightly to one side, then righted itself. Imagine someone grabbing the trunk and shaking it as hard as they could. We all witnessed it and it scared all of us terribly. It was a large real tree, and there were no animals in the house and no earthquake. We couldn’t come up with any sort of explanation for what happened. It scared my brother so badly that he still gets angry with me all these years later if I bring it up.\n\nMy parents sold that house and moved to a new one a few years ago. None of us have had any weird experiences since. The strange thing about that house was that it was not that old when my parents bought it…maybe 30 years old with no deaths in it. So what was causing all of the scary experiences? It felt malicious, like it wanted us to be scared. Just curious what others think of this!",

My grandfather saved my life. and somehow my dad who was upstairs in the same room already knew that my aunt saw my Grandfather ( Who passed).before she told him.\n\n\nThis one isn't my experience but it's a dream my mom had.\nI don't feel comfortable sharing the man's name so let's call him \" Joe Jared Jackson\" This guy had a very specific name.  but she had a dream a Hispanic man was in her room singing the song \" Party like it's 1999 by Prince\" and he kept repeating that his name was \"Joe Jared Jackson\nMy mom claimed to have had a very eariee feeling from the dream and told my dad. My dad did some research and it turns out someone named\n(Joe Jared Jackson ) from her hometown went missing in 1999 and was never found. Very creepy I know.\n\n\nAgain another one that isn't related to ghosts and another very personal one that I won't get into details about  but I have a family member who can heal certain injurys immediately. I know it sounds crazy but I'll put it like this. if you know then you know.\n\nAgain this one is very personal so I'm not sharing the demon's name but when I was 5 - 6 I would have these dreams almost every night that haunted me where a certain demon visited me. I remember one specific dream where he brought me to hell and was being nice to me all of a sudden and showing me his brother and trying to trick me. Again I'm sorry for not getting into details but we figured out who it was and took care of it. Don't ask how. I probably had over 100 of these dreams with the same one.\n\nmy family have had several other smaller experiences such as\nbeing pulled off beds, Seeing several ghosts and hearing them etc.\n\nwhat is the most convincing evidence you've seen whether videos or stories",

        "text": "The night before last, I was having a pretty good night, watching some documentaries on the Hatfields and McCoys, when all of a sudden I felt my mood shift dramatically. I went from playing with my dog and laughing and watching television, to sitting on the edge of the couch ready to cry. I just felt this overwhelming sadness, grief, come over me like a blanket, it was a little after 5:00 a.m.                I grabbed my notebook, it's a journal that I keep notes in for situations like this and for when I feel that something has come close, spirits, energy, etc. and I started writing whatever was coming into mind at that moment.                                                                                                                                                   The following is what I wrote down:  \" 5:10 a.m. Not sure who it is, but someone has passed over to the other side, it just hit me like a hammer, I think it's family or family knows her, I just can't put my finger on it, but I can't go to bed, I am waiting, cause I know that there will be news in a few hours. I feel so heavy, with dark sadness, I know who this is, I know, I know, I know. It's happened or it's about to, I feel it's about to but hasn't yet\"                                                                                                                                Well I found out about 11:30 a.m. what I was waiting for, I got a call about 11:30 and was told that my brother in laws wife had just passed away.  It's a long story, but because of schedules and where everyone lives, I hardly ever see him and I rarely ever see his wife, neither one of us is on Facebook or anything like that to get news about family. At any rate, I knew that she had been diagnosed with throat cancer about a year ago and that she was going to doctors and what not, but I didn't know what her current medical status was or anything like that.                                                                                   But when that feeling hit me, it was hard, and I had tears in my eyes and everything else, I just knew that there was what I felt was a death about to take place, and that it was a female, and that it was family or family known. Anyone else ever experience this and it happen?",

        "text": "Okie, so my names Mandy, and I’ve had a bunch of just weird and spooky stuff happen to me over the course of around 4 years…my first experience with anything spooky was I was about 13, and was walking to my grandmas house on a back trail about a quarter-mile away and as I’m walking, I hear this man’s voice that yelled “Mandy!” So I stop, look around, and yell “hello??” There’s no answer, so thinking nothing of it I continue to my grandmas house. When I get home I ask my family if they’d been outside and called my name when I’d left earlier that day, and none of them had ever even been outside. I didn’t think much of it and moved on…until about 6 months later or so I was reading a book on my bed, and out of the corner of my eye, I see the metal part a metal that I had hung on my wall slllooowwwwlllly lift into the air, so I whip my head around to fully look at it, and immediately it drops and starts swinging back and forth on my wall like a pendulum. It just kept swinging as I watched it until finally I walked over, stopped it, and took it off the wall. A few nights later I woke in the middle of the night to my phone turning itself on, even though I’d never turned it off. Nothing else happened for the next year or so…but one evening I had a friend stay the night, and we were walking home along the backtrail from my grandmas house after a long day of playing Minecraft. So it’s pitch black out except for the full moon shining, giving everything an unearthly kinda glow, and as we walk into my front yard, out of the corner of my eye, on top of an electrical pole, backlit by the moon, I see this tall, black, lanky figure with unnaturally long limbs. So I turn my head to look straight at it, but as soon as I do it’s gone. I figured it was all in my head, until my friend chuckles a bit nervously and says “I think we’ve played too much Minecraft, I think I just saw an Enderman on top of that poll.” \n…he had seen it too.\n   That was the last thing that happened until I was 15, and my grandpa passed away. It was a couple of nights after his funeral, it was dark out, and my mom was having me carry in a couple of bags from the car, so I’m out in the carport alone, grab the bags, take a step to walk towards the house, and I hear a “FLAP FLAP FLAP” like someone’s running really fast towards me wearing flip flops. So I pause, listen, nothing. So I take another step \n“FLAP FLAP FLAP”\nI stop again. Silence. So thinking it was one of my cousins or someone pranking me I call out “hello? Anyone there? If this is a prank it’s not funny!” Silence.\nSo I take another couple steps, at this point I have this overwhelming feeling of dread and the hairs on my arms are raised\n“FLAP FLAPFLAP FLAP FLAP” \nI stop, silence again. So finally I say a silent prayer in my head for protection, take another step, and there’s nothing. So I run in the house and lock the door. The next morning I go out with my mom to see if we could replicate the sound, and the only thing that could was beating some weeds agains the tin siding of the car port really hard, but there were no signs that anyone had been back there. \nThat was the last thing that happened  until about a month ago… I was trying to fall asleep and I just couldn’t no matter how hard I tried. It was about. 3:30 AM when I finally decided to just roll on my side and shut my eyes. After a bit I could feel my body relaxing, but my mind was still going 100 miles an hour, but then suddenly I can feel what feels like someone picking up strands on my hair and twisting it between their fingers, so I try to turn, and find that I can’t move. The sense of dread that I already had becomes overwhelming, and this heavy weight comes on Me like someone sitting on my side, and it an unearthly howl screeches in my ear. I thought I was gonna die right then and there. I tried to pray out loud, but I couldn’t move, so I screamed a prayer in my head for help and immediately the howling was gone I could move again. I stayed awake the rest of the night in fear that it would happen again. Then just a few mornings ago I was woken by vigorous tapping on my window. \n   What does this all mean? Any advice? (Sorry for the long post btw hope you can make sense of it all😅)",

Confused he kept walking just to check on me but when he got to the swing he says he saw my deceased great grandmother cradling me as she slowly swung back and forth on the porch swing. Every time he tells me this story the last thing he tells me is that she told him in a calm quiet voice “go back to bed Jason”.",

So as we walked past my dog froze on the sidewalk staring through one of the windows and growling. The house is a museum now, and this was after hours so nobody was there. I kept pulling but he would not budge. This has happened on several occasions. Now his head spins around sometimes and he pukes green slime. We have to keep him on a leash at night or else he floats away. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Curious your thoughts.",

I unlocked the door and when coming in was greeted with barking by one of the little dogs. Seconds later I heard what sounded like the noise of someone being surprised/caught off guard from the living room/kitchen. The little dog even paused a quick moment to look back at whatever made the noise. Getting confirmation like that from the dog and the fact the noise was loud enough for me to hear over the barks really did creep me out. During this time I was too afraid to look into the dark living room/kitchen and did my best to quickly find the light. Once I turned the lights on, of course there was nothing there and all doors were locked. Nothing else creepy happened staying at their house. \n\nInitially, I was more terrified of an intruder being in the home than a ghost, but im thinking maybe it was. What do you guys think?",

My grandfather is unfortunately dead but my dad has told me many of his ghost (or in this case demon) stories. \n\nFirst of all my grandfather was adopted by a teacher who lived in the basement of the school house she worked at, weird I know but that’s what I’ve been told. My grandfather and his adoptive mother slept in the same bed and one night my grandfather woke up to, and I shit you not, gremlins dancing and chanting around his bed. My grandfather tries to wake up his mother but she just tells him to go back to sleep. More crazy shit happens when a big-ass eyeball comes up from the floor, looks at my grandfather, and tells him something along the lines of.\n\n“I’m gonna get you, Charlie,” my grandfather tries to wake up his mother and tell her about all of the things he’s seeing and she tells him to flip around in bed. My grandfather was Native American and apparently in Native American folklore if you're seeing weird ghost shit while in bed you flip around, as in your head goes where your feet should go and your feet go where your head should go or something like that idk. My grandfather flips around, closes his eyes, opens them, and then everything is gone. \n\nNow with my dad, he used to suffer from sleep paralysis, like all the time. And one time he had sleep paralysis he was laying on his back and everything was dark and suddenly a dark cloud, with dark lightning bolts around, comes into my dad's frame of view. The cloud starts getting closer to my dad and then goes to the other side of the room. Then my dad is all of a sudden put into a third-person view of himself and then the third-person view plunges down on my dad and then he wakes up. \n\nMy experiences on the other hand have thankfully been more, not so bad. Like I’ll hear things like whispers and see shadow figures. Like for example one time I was getting ready for school and I was walking down the hallway and I passed my room and as clear as day I hear someone whisper my name. I told my mom about it on the way to school and she said I was just paranoid and maybe I was idk. I started calling the ghost in my house “Ricky” after Ricky Goldworth from Buzzfeed Unsolved. I have a habit of naming things after characters I like. \n\nIf y’all want more of my paranormal experiences I will gladly deliver.",

        "text": "So, I’m not really a huge believer in the whole spirituality things (ya know, auras, negative energies, sage). However, there have been a few points in my life that could have potentially been “supernatural” so I’d like your thoughts on it. I will give the points (some vary in detail due to not remembering them) and my theories.\n1. “The Gorilla”. When I was little (probably around 7, not too sure) I was chilling in the living room doing… 7 year old things, when I saw a shadowy figure which my brain decided looked like a gorilla coming up the stairs from the games/toy room. (House was 4 levels). However, I didn’t really feel any emotions or anything from it. Just sorta happened, which leads me to believe that it was my imagination.\n2. The Hotwheel. Around when I was the same age as before, my parents and I were at Walmart, and there was a toy car in the shopping cart they said they would buy for me. I had a tantrum for seven year old reasons, and they put it back on the shelf. A few months later, that very car was in my toy bin. I had TONS of Hot Wheels at the point (like 5 buckets), so I could have owned it before and didn’t realize, but I have no idea.\n3. The fast food bag. This happened a little bit after (or before. Can’t remember) the previous two events. We were on a family trip, and we stopped at a restaurant in a small town along the way. While ordering our food, I could have sworn I watched a food bag slide across the back counter by itself. Someone may have grabbed it and I didn’t notice, but it didn’t seem like it.\n4. The man and the crows. This event actually happened this year, while I was walking my dog. My mom had told me to walk her for a minimum of 30 minutes, so, to kill time I took a route I didn’t take too often. It was a large field (could have been a gravel pit or a site for future construction. No idea) on top of a hill. Walking through the field, I saw about 20+ crows all hanging around this older man. He didn’t acknowledge me as I walked past, and my dog didn’t react too unnaturally (she was curious of course, as she was 7 months old). My theory is that there was a dead animal, and that the guy had found it and was just sorta checking it out, but I don’t know.\nI apologize for the somewhat messy writing. I’m not the best at explaining things. Please give me your thoughts on these though, as they have been on my mind for a while now.",

When we get there one of my friends mention that there is a place where people do witchcraft or rituals, being intrigued and not superstitious prior to this event I agreed and wanted to explore the Dense wooded area of the park. Upon exploring for a bit we came across a patch or circle with plants and stones surrounding it. We initially thought nothing of it and took photos, until all three of us heard two loud footsteps behind us, (keep in mind there was no way for any person to enter that area because we were in a steep hill with only one path to get up at that time.), and we ran out of there. When we stopped to catch out breaths we turned around to see if whatever it was was following us, and when we did we saw a black lanky figure following us slowly and we ran out of the park. It wasnt me seeing things becuase all three of us saw it at the time. The reason I’m writing this here is to get an answer as to what that circle could’ve been and what it meant.",

We were both entirely sober, this was well before we both started smoking. The night was going well and we were having fun, but we were getting tired so we decided to make the walk back to his house. We were nearing his house, walking through the nearby school, when my friend saw a giant green road sign in the middle of the road. I noticed it too but didn’t think much of it, but he told me that that sign had never been there before. I can vividly remember what it looked like and it does seem out of place. It was one of the high highway signs that tells you which way to get into the nearest city, it doesn’t make sense for it to be right in between a middle school and a neighborhood. It’s not there anymore, either. I think it’s pretty safe to say it was only there for that night. My friend and I still don’t know what to think of it so we just call it “the portal.” Sometimes we’ll speculate on what could be on the other side or when it could open again. We have a running theory that it opens every Halloween because of ghosts or witches or something. I joke about it, but honestly it freaks me out a little.",

I was staying near the Van Gogh Museum. I had just come back from spending Christmas \nin Harlem. It was getting late and I decided to go for a walk. I ended up having a late dinner near Leidsplein Square. After dinner,\naround 11pm, I was going to have a sit in the square and meditate for a while. I had a rather deep meditation experience (for being in \nsuch a busy area). When I finished I decided to stroll home. I left the square and headed towards Museumsplein. I crossed the canal \nheading Southwest, and turned left walking on the path near the canal. As I did I heard laughter. It sounded malicious, and close. I \nlooked all around and couldn't see anyone around. It was weird, but having spent a bit of time in the area I didn't find it too unusual as\nsometimes echos travel down the canals. Not five seconds after the laughter something hit me. It felt like being hit by a blast wave or \nconcussion. It came from the direction of the canal hitting me on my left side. It almost knocked me from my feet and at the same time it \nfelt like someone put a taser to the base of my neck on the front left side. My ears were ringing so loudly it was hard to hear anything\nelse. I looked in the direction of the sensation, more startled than afraid. As I did it hit me again, but maybe with only 40% of the\nenergy of the primary \"event.\" I was looking in the direction it came from. Could not see anything. The shock faded and fear set in. I \nstarted to run to the right and crossed the street. I got to Museumsplien and just as I passed the iconic AMSTERDAM red letters in the\nsquare, it happened three more times one after the other with maybe only 10% of the energy of the primary \"event\" and in quick succession.\n There is/ was an art installation after the sign on the left and there were three Italian teens hanging by the sculpture. They seemed to \nnotice or be affected by the events, or they were affected by perceiving me being affected by them. I start to run again and don't stop \nuntil I am at my hotel past the Van Gogh Museum. I have spent a great deal of time looking into possible explanations for these events. \nIt felt like a blast wave or concussion, but the weird thing is that it did not move other matter around me. Plants and other objects \nseemed unaffected. When the first blast happend, I thought it was a terror attack or a bomb had gone off. It wasn't until the subsequent \nblasts that I noticed that I seemed to be the only matter affected except for possibly the Italians in the square. I have looked into \npossible medical causes: strokes, pinched nerves, and anything that could shed light on the event. I do a google dive every year to see\nif there is anything similar on the webs. The closest explanation yet came 2 years later when Havanna Syndrome hit the news. \n\nHas anyone ever experienced something like this? Could you please share possible explanations? I am reluctant to say I was attacked by \nan unseen force... but that is what it felt like. I was in good health, sober, and centered when it happened.\n\nI was so shook that the woman at the hotel front desk noticed and asked if I was okay. I tried to explain what happened without seeming \ncrazy. She could see how shook I was and seemed very curious. She actually lifted my email from my reservation and emailed me the next \nday to check on me and ask a few questions. Please shine light if you have light to shine!",

For context - I would sleep in the early morning hours and our house was small. I did not close my bedroom door. My door opened facing our dining room and beyond I could see our living room through an open arch. My bed was against the back wall and I would normally sleep looking out my door.\n\nOne day I was laying down and the house was dark until suddenly I heard a switching sound and BOOM my entire line of vision went white like an explosion of the purest light I can imagine. It faded as quickly as it happened and I was so confused and terrified. \n\nThis would happen as regularly as a few times a week or as scarcely as every few weeks / even go a few months before happening again. But it was always in the early morning hours while I was lying down and my mom was asleep.\n\nI talked to my mom and family about this and everyone figured I was seeing things.. dreaming.. or somehow the light from a car was shining through our windows - but this was not possible as all our windows had closed blinds AND curtains.\n\nI was paranoid about it being an electrical problem so I inspected every plug in socket and appliance we had.. especially in the kitchen where I thought the noise was coming from. Nothing was amiss and we'd had our electric work re-done a few years before including new breakers and a new box so.. I never found evidence.\n\nI was so paranoid I began leaving my old iPod out on our table pointing into the dining room.. I never got any proof but one night I saw the light again within minutes of when my fully charged iPod must have died.. I figured it was coincidence.\n\nThis drove me mad for over a year or so. My family would jokingly ask about it occasionally and I would tell them it was still happening.\n\nOne night I was walking around my house brushing before bed and I passed the kitchen door.. I was staring into the kitchen as I heard the switching sound and I SAW this white light shoot up the wall behind a big freezer and BOOM I could only see a blur in my peripherals of something besides this blinding light in front of me.\n\nI knew I was not dreaming or seeing things from being tired now. I was horrified. I saw it on and off for a few months while lying in bed like usual.\n\nMy primary reason for sharing this: someone else finally saw it with me.\n\nMy niece stayed over once around the holidays. We'd been up around 3 or 4 in the morning.. lying on the couch watching movies. I heard the switching sound and before she could even ask me what the noise was.. BOOM. We were looking through the arch into the dining room and every thing beyond it was this pure white light - I can barely explain how surreal it is. We could see the living room we're in but beyond was WHITE \n\nWe sat in stunned silence for several minutes. She was nearly crying from fear and she ask me if THAT was the light I was talking about and I said yes. I was relieved someone else had seen it but also.. concerned. \n\nI would keep checking our plug-ins and appliances and never found any reason for this. When I was about 18 or 19.. I saw it for the final time and have never seen any thing like this since. My niece and I still talk about the experience and we're confused.\n\nDoes anyone have a reason why this could have happened.. paranormal or otherwise?\n\nMy mom and I have experienced other occurrences in this house we cannot explain and if anyone is interested I can share below, but this one was the most disturbing for me.",

I went south to Florida, and as I started working my way back up I started wondering if I should head west, I've always wanted to go west. \n\nIn Washington DC\nI was outside the Walmart in DC. A woman passed me, and several minutes came back to ask me if I believed in Jesus. She said the spirit had told her to come back to talk to me, to tell me that I need to turn around. I thanked her for her message, later that night I was headed north again. \n\nLaurel Maryland \nA man approached me, and told me that I was going the wrong way, that I need to turn around. He said very little else. \n\nWaterville Maine \nA man approached me to ask for a lighter. We smoked in silence side by side a few moments before he spoke. He said \"I'm gods third messenger. God says you are going the wrong way, if you do not turn around you will die.\"\n\n\n\nI did not continue further north or head west. I went back to a town I knew had plenty of resources, got a job and saved just enough money to repair a series of car issues as they happened. \n\n\nIt's been some time since these three strangers all approached me with similar messages, but the last one sends tingles down my spine still. \n\nI feel kind of like a crazy person for asking this but, it doesn't feel like these things are coincidence...

I am very interested in communicating with spirits, and I am fairly intuitive, trying to hone the skill, etc.\n\nAnyway, I started an almost nightly thing where I put on the headphones and listen before going to bed to see if I get any messages, kind of like talking to friends on the phone. I began to get someone telling me to get a piece of paper and a pencil. Then I will write down whatever words they say (even if it doesn't really make sense at the time), and they will end the communication by telling me to put it away.\n\nSometimes, they will ask me to write down numbers, and they did this last night. Has anyone had a similar experience? **My husband wants to know if there can be anything sinister in something telling you to write down numbers, or words in general**. (he's always worried about negative entities, although I get the sense it's something trying to help me).",

I'd recently made this account to lurk these kinds of channels out of interest post experience but I'm a sceptic, I don't believe in God, the afterlife, ghosts or anything else paranormal but a couple of months ago I had an experience that's rattled my usual mantra of \"there is always a logical explanation\", and it has had me questioning my lifelong perception.\n\nI'd gone on a camping trip with my partner, and we were sleeping in a tent close to a riverbank following a day of fishing, there was a little rain about but nothing to worry us, there was no reception there to check the weather but that was what we'd gone to this particular area for, just us getting away for a week alone.\n\nI was dreaming and my mother who is passed away appeared out of nowhere and grabbed me in quite a panic \"Wake up and go home, now!\" She screamed at me and shook me quite violently, I could even feel her fingernails scratching my chest in my dream where she grabbed me on the collared shirt that I was wearing, the shrill of her voice and the look in her eyes caused me to jolt awake in a huff and I woke my partner up with my panic and sudden movement, it was about 1am.\n\nMy partner asked me if I was okay because I was actually quite upset and rattled, I could feel a slight stinging pain on my chest and thinking that I'd been bitten by an ant or spider while I was sleeping, I grabbed the lantern we had in the tent and turned it on to see 6 fresh, identical scratch marks 3 on either side of my chest on my skin where I'd dreamt that my mother had scratched me when she'd grabbed me in the dream.\n\n\"Where did you get those?\" My boyfriend asked me, I was more than a little freaked out, the scratches hadn't drawn blood, but they were quite red and noticeable.\n\n\"I had a nightmare that mum grabbed me and screamed at me to wake up and go home, I dreamt that she scratched me there\" I replied still very confused and looking for another explanation for the scratches amongst our blankets\n\nI don't believe in this stuff, but my boyfriend does, and he jumped up, dragged me out of the tent and threw our belongings and tent into the back of the car as quickly as he could in a jumbled mess, and we drove the 3 and a half hours home mid holiday, all while I tried to convince him that it was just a bad dream and that we should go back and live out the rest of our holiday.\n\nThe next afternoon my partner practically dragged me into his office to show me on his computer that the area where we'd been sleeping in our tent had been hit by a sudden rise in flood waters and the riverbank that we'd been camping on was at least 3 meters underwater and he explained to me that the waters had apparently risen within an hour of us leaving. \n\nI've refused to talk to him about it or admit to him that it's got me rattled and lost for explanation, but he recently talked me into visiting my mother's grave to thank her for saving our lives, we mowed the lawn and left fresh flowers, I'm hoping that sharing this experience with someone that isn't hellbent on getting me to admit that this stuff exists, will allow me to focus and get some sleep at last.",

No one let her in.\n\nI finished up my smoke and then went Inside to do some Christmas decor I was working on.\n\nAbout an hour later, I went to have another smoke and the same little kitten come from the livingroom, and into the sun porch area, then proceeded to get out the door, walk down the steps and go around the corner of the house with my two other cats AGAIN!.. \n\nMy daughter brought her in the house a short time later, and I put the whole thing behind me and then went on with the rest of my night. When I went to go to the bathroom, a few hours later, I noticed meowing coming from outside, and I thought it was my older cat, but when I open the door, the kitten came inside instead again!\n\nNO ONE LET HER OUT!\n\nWhat happened? My friend says it sounds like a demon, and I need to get rid of my kitten but idk it seems like something more.",

        "text": " I posted this in u/Thetruthishere but i feel like it might fit in here as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure a lot of you reading this can relate to losing someone. I've definitely endured quite a bit of loss throughout my lifetime, though this specific one hit harder than ones before and has taken awhile to come to terms with. In 2019 i received a phone call late in the night from a close friend of mine. Levi wasn't the type to call, he was more of a \"texter\" So when I saw his name flashing on my cellphone at 2 am i knew it couldn't be good. I picked up the phone walked out of my bedroom and went into the next room to take the call so I wouldn't wake up my sleeping GF and newborn.\n\nI was told within the first 20 seconds of the call that there had been an accident and our friend Tyler was gone. I went from half asleep to wide awake in a split second. \"WHAT? GONE? WTF DOES THAT EVEN MEAN LEVI?\" I got shitty, I got pissed bc I didn't believe him. Until he told me again that Tyler was gone. There was an accident when he driving and that he was dead. He told me himself and a few others of our friend group were all at his house and told me i could come over if i wanted to.\n\nAfter we got off the phone I fell to floor, I was in complete shock and disbelief. There's no way this is happening. This isn't real. A few moments later I went back into my bedroom picked up my 4 month old sleeping son, walked downstairs to sit in our recliner and just bawled my eyes out for hours.\n\nTyler had been texting me that night, he asked me what i was up too around 9 or 10. Myself and my GF were just on the couch playing overcooked on the switch. I had asked him the same about what he was doing. He responded that he was \"Drunk\" and i assumed he was just at his house or another's. He was a very social dude and loved to be out and about drinking with people. He was loved by many and a friend to all. I had removed myself mostly from that lifestyle bc of getting into a serious relationship and having my first child. I had fallen asleep while we were messaging back and fourth and his last message read \" you winning?\"\n\nI never thought to ask where he was or if he needed a ride. He wrecked his truck on the way home from the bar that night. Just an hour or so after that last message was sent to my phone. The GUILT of not asking him if he was okay and if he needed a ride or anything, JUST ASSUMING he was good. That guilt took over my life and consumed me to the point where i was now drinking heavily myself on a regular basis. Whiskey every single night, blacking out to numb the pain and guilt. I almost lost my job, i stopped taking care of myself. Most importantly I stopped being a good partner and father. My GF at one point had her car packed with all her belongings and my sons. Telling me to say goodbye to him as i was wasted sitting my garage. Somehow i was fortunate enough that she ended up staying and i slowly got my shit together.\n\nFF to a few years later. Throughout this time I would occasionally talk to Tyler, whether that be in my head silently or even out loud at times when i was alone. Asking him PLEASE tell me you're okay, somehow find a way please. I had come to terms with his death but I didn't have that closure and reassurance still if that makes any sense. I had a few dreams where I thought he was there but it felt cloudy and I would forget a lot if not all of the details of said dream. However a few months back i had another dream, one so REAL so VIVID about him.\n\nThis is strange and hard to explain but we are all giant nerds coupled with heavy levels of sarcasm within my friend group. Stupid childish, immature, sarcastic humor is the NORM. So when my dream started off with me and Tyler walking into a bathroom together and then both walking up to a toilet and seeing a huge turd we both started yelling \"POOOOOOOP\" and dying laughing.\n\n ( WEIRD IK, but it just was just us)\n\nThen all of a sudden, the back of the wall behind the toilet opened up like a door. The Bathroom completely disappeared in front of us. Moments later the most amazingly beautiful scenery lay before me. Huge mountains, lush green grass and incredibly blue skies. Picture that first time in \"Breath Of The Wild\" When link walks up to the edge of the mountain and you get that first look of how beautiful that world was.\n\nTyler turned to me and didn't say a word but just looked at me. I knew instantly without him even speaking that he had to go leave and go back into this place and i couldn't follow him.\n\n\"You don't have to go man, Please don't. Stay here for a little longer\" I was pleading with him.\n\nHe still said nothing. Just smiled and walked into that \"world\" and kept eye contact with me as the door closed back up. The dream immediately faded to black and I woke up.\n\nTyler was 27 when he left us. He was a great friend, we spent so much time together over the years. Good times far outweighing the bad, &amp; i could spend hours telling stories about the stupid shit we got into and somehow got out of. This is the first time I've told this story and i know it's long winded but after reading some others stories on here about similar experiences i thought this would be the best time share mine and get it off my chest. I honestly believe he visited me that last time, to tell me he's okay.\n\nTyler, I love you man. I miss you every SINGLE FUCKING DAY.\n\nI cannot wait till we meet again my friend.\n\nThankyou for reading if you made it this far.\n\n***TLDR : Lost a close friend in a car accident &amp; I believe he came back to me recently in a dream to tell me he's okay.***",

Well I had moved for work recently to OK for about a year before I came back. My first few months I actually felt like the night sky was super bright compared to the night sky in GA. That is until my last 7 months where it suddenly got dark like I’m looking at the moon but the sky and everything around me is damn near pitch black almost as if the light can’t get through. It let up a little (kinda like the sky was patchy) during my last month in OK. BUT last night as I was finalizing my move back to GA I had to drive through tennessee then Alabama and when I tell you the night was so fucking dark I was horrified like I know it was drizzling and even full on raining at points in my trip but the sky was so black I felt like if I didn’t have the lights of other vehicles on me I would get swallowed into the darkness. Is anyone else experiencing this? Because I’ve not ever been scared of the dark but this darkness seems unnatural to me like it just doesn’t make sense.",

For all of these years I never dreamt of him, not once. Now, my grandma is in very poor health. I saw her in her nursing home for Thanksgiving and it's obvious she doesn't have much time left with us.\nLast night, my grandpa came to me in my dream. I walked into the kitchen of his house. It was warm and cozy and the same wooden cabinets were there from their old house. I saw my grandpa standing at the counter, wearing one of his usual button-down plaid shirts. He was a very tall man and in life he haaaated to be hugged. He used to say to us grandkids, \"ah jeez, really? Ya gotta give me a kiss? Ok.\" He was so gruff but he was full of love and we used to tease him about it. Well, when I saw him in my dream I said \"I know you don't like hugs but I don't care\" and he hugged me back. I asked how my deceased uncle is, and he said he's ok. I asked him one more question, but I can't remember it now. But throughout the whole dream, even though he was happy to see me, he seemed a little sad and I thought of my grandma. I think he's telling me it's time for my grandma to join him. In almost 20 years he's never come to me - I know he would never want to trouble or upset me. So for him to visit is a big deal. But at least I got to hug him.",
