I chocked it up to my headphones going out, so I tried my phone speaker, and it sounded the same, so I just assumed, well, maybe my phone speaker is off too. Anyway, I've noticed things sounding weird since then, so I figured maybe my hearing is just not as good as it used to be (I'm 26, btw). However, I noticed eventually that the only voices that sounded weird were ones I had listened to as I slept. I've tried looking it up and couldn't find anything, but I think about this very frequently, so tonight I tried to dig a little deeper. All I could find were some forum posts that are specific to music, and I don't experience this with music, only voices.\n\nIt's very annoying, and it has lessened my enjoyment of the content I generally watch, so now I have to avoid falling asleep to anything I want to watch.

But space has a few hydrogen atoms per cubic metre, so even space isn't empty?\n\nIf there are a few hydrogen atoms per cubic metre , then wouldn't say a cubic centimetre from that cubic metre then be hydrogen free? Wouldn't the space between then be technically empty?\n\nOr is the measurement of perfect/ empty at minimum a cubic metre?",

I genuinely dont understand and want to. \n\nThis happens most commonly in my experience when I'm doing campaigns for sex trafficking awareness, and even was once told this by a co-worker for saying we shouldn't bully each other. I've seen it happen to others too. They'll just be talking and someone goes \"You're not special, you know.\" Nobody ever said they were when this comes up, and it's usually surrounding topics of protecting OTHERS. Which makes it more weird and random! Like, I disagree with the term virtue signaling but I can build the bridge of how you got there. \"You're not special\" when caring about others just seems so left field and I don't understand. Someone please build this bridge for me. Help me understand my peers better, even if I disagree with them. \n\nSide note, if you're reading this you are special af to me and you're also awesome as hell. Cool face.",
