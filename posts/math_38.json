Does this mean that hyperbolic spaces are just extensions of standard Euclidean geometry into the complex plane, or is there something else that’s very different between these two spaces that would make trying to express objects in hyperbolic spaces through the complex plane not work practically? And since these functions are based off of the unit hyperbola, is there a relationship between the circle and hyperbola that uses complex numbers rather than switching the + to a - in their cartesian functions? I’m sorry if this is just me rambling but I’m not that learned in math (I’m currently taking a high school calculus course) and this is something that interests me but also appears to be wildly beyond the scope of my current understanding.",

So, let's say we have two sets and a map between the Two. \n\nIf we are to talk about contiuity, we give each set a topology. Now, here is the interesting point, you retain continuity even if you increase the number of opens in the domain, but you lose it if you increase it too much in the codomain. That is, for the most chance for a random map to have continuity, it would be best to have least number of open sets.\n\nNow, why would want a generalized notion for continuity to behave in such a way? Can a meta topological explanation be given?",

I am taking the time differences between these timestamps, and doing my calculations on the seconds between timestamps. \n\nTechnically, when I pull this data, at that time, it is every single data point that would exist for that situation, minus log loss that may or may not occur. \n\nDoes this mean I can do population based calculations? Or should I do sample since, more timestamps could be created after the moment in time I grab the timestamps. \n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

I'm wondering if this system has a name already or even if it can exist (ie I'm not sure if there's some obvious contradiction I'm missing that makes this not possible).

Krylov. However, this text is too analysis-focused for me; I prefer a text that has a more probability-orientated point of view. \n\nBasically, I'm looking for a good second-read book that would serve as a reference point for my future work. I quickly glanced at Applebaum's \"Lévy Processes and Stochastic Calculus\" and Protter's \"Stochastic Integration And Differential Equations\". Which of those would you recommend?

What are the odds that all eight of your cards are the same type?\n\nOur group had three ideas (we ignored the Wild Magic cards):\n\n1.) Three to the eighth power (1:6561) because there is a 1:3 chance that each card is a certain type.\n\n2.) Three to the seventh power (1:2187) because we're not specifying which of the three types the cards need to be. So, after you get your first card, you have seven cards with a 1:3 chance that it will match the first card.\n\n3.) Three to the fifth power (1:243) because you're guaranteed to have at least three of one card type, so the rest of the five cards have a 1:3 chance of matching whatever type that is.\n\nWhich idea is correct? Or are none of these ideas correct?\n\nThanks for your help!",

Now, either I can prove that every natural number will appear as a power of x in the expansion, or construct some kind of proof by contradiction, saying that there is some positive integer which doesn’t appear in the expansion. I’m new to combinatorics, so I’m not sure if I’m heading down a sensible path here, but in general I think a proof using generating functions should be possible. Thoughts?",

        "text": "Are there fields within linear algebra dedicated to binary/logical/Boolean/relationship matrices? I'm wondering how I might be able to come up to speed on how binary matrices are being used. I skipped over too much math in my college days and now I'm struggling a bit with some AI/ML problems I am trying to solve.\n\nCurrently, I am trying to figure out how to use binary relationship matrices to identify patterns. While I can find a few things here and there, I can't find as much as I would like. I suspect that's because of my limited math skills. Having gone through 12 years of college, 3 degrees, and spent the past 30-years working in software, I am disappointed in the lack of math required for a CS degree. I should have stuck with EE. I'm willing to step back and build the necessary mathematical foundations that I need, even if it takes a year or two. But I don't know if that is really what I need.\n\nWhat I need is a solid foundation in the use of binary matrices. I suspect that would not require a master’s in mathematics, but I am really struggling to find any useful information online. I am hoping that some of the experts here can point me in the right direction, maybe offer some guidance.\n\nI think that using binary relationship matrices in AI/ML to identify patterns can potentially solve some problems I am working on in compiler optimizations. I can get into more detail if anyone is interested. But the short version is just that I need to understand what these matricies can be used for. Can they be used to identify patterns? Similar to local binary patterns identification in computer vision, but more specifically using a binary relation matrices.\n\nAny suggestions or guidance on how to come up to speed on using binary matrices would be much appreciated. I'm looking for things like distance equations, Norms (L1, L2, Frobenius, etc.) but I'm hoping to find something about identify patterns. I can find plenty of information about matrices, but what I can't find is specific information about binary matrices. I recall having come across this sort of information years ago, but I'm not having any luck finding it now. After a few months of searching here and there, I thought I would reach out here for guidence.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJon",
