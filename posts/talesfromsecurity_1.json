        "text": "Last night I told my old company in the politest way I could to go fuck themselves. Content that a friend had already pulled my intended final two finger salute when he waited till part way through his patrol I simply tendered my resignation effective immediately via an email that went out to all the management staff and the head of HR's personal email. Please note that some details have been changed along with names.\n\n\n&gt;  To whom it may concern;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Due to a variety of factors including my personal physical and mental well being I am tendering my resignation effective immediately. While I appreciate St. Georgeas a company offering me my first job in the security over the last several months I have been provided multiple reasons to be concerned about the professionalism of Bad Boss and as he has continually turned a blind eye to the complaints and a general dissatisfaction and concern regarding Bad Boss by nearly every St. George employee I have interacted with John Harley as well.\n&gt;  \n&gt; My first significant concern regarding their professionalism came on Wednesday February 7th, 2018 when I was asked at the beginning of my patrol officer shift to search the parking lot of the Double Tree in located at 175 First ave, BFE for a lost titanium wedding band. As to my knowledge the hotel was not a current, former, or potential client I had grave concerns about the legitimacy of such a request during times that are usually billable to company clients. When I contacted John Harley to verify the request validity I was simply told that if it was requested of me and I could do it I should. When I informed Mr. Bad Boss that I was unable to find the ring after twenty minutes of searching as the lot was covered with three inches of snow from the previous night I was instructed to feel around for it. This particular event was the impetus for me to begin recording all calls between me and the management staff of St. George in case of future abuses of power, this action is legal in our state as recording conversations only requires the consent of one party involved. Since then I have heard first hand as Mr. Bad Boss bragged to another patrol officer about physically assaulting a junior supervisor who had recently quit by refusing to attend his scheduled shifts. He has also boasted that he is fond of showing up at employee’s homes and threatening them if they do not return to work.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mr. Harley himself raises questions of nepotism by continuing to employ his daughter in a role which he has authority over and on the two occasions I have encountered her during my time with the company both post were relatively low risk but paid at the higher end of the spectrum for unarmed guards.\n\n&gt; Additionally, I have grave concerns about the legality of some of their behavior and it’s potential to expose the company to legal liability. While this includes the continued failure to respond to Patrol officers stating that they are unable to perform client requested duties such as internal patrols of the buildings located at~~ two locations redacted for client respect~~ it more directly bears on their treatment regarding their repeated insistence that it is the duty of patrol officers to cover shifts at the ~~Major Grocery chain~~ stores which unarmed guards do not appear for in the morning. As I’m sure our legal department is aware federal law prohibits an increase or reduction in pay while a guard is performing the duties of his post, despite this Mr. Bad Boss has continually altered patrol officer’s schedules so that they are paid the same rate as unarmed officers when covering this shift even though they are supposedly required to do so as part of their patrol duties.\n\n&gt; Bad Boss was informed during my initial interview that I have a preexisting injury to my left knee and ankle that impaired my ability to stand for long periods of time however he routinely placed me at locations that required me to stand for the entire shift, eventually necessitating me to bring a cane into work while I was stationed at the ~~Major Grocery chain~~ store located on Second Ave to prevent myself from collapsing while on duty. \n\n&gt; Due to the policy of requiring us to cover shifts missed by unarmed guards I have had at least one occasion where I started a patrol shift at 6pm and not left for home until after 2pm the following day. I have covered shifts like this and been told they were looking for relief for me while my mother was receiving treatment in the emergency room after collapsing at her place of employment only to discover later that they had lied and assigned the entire shift to me within an hour of initial contact.\n\n&gt; Similarly, due to Bad Boss’ inability to manage employee time I have failed to receive a consistent schedule often receiving several schedule changes in a week without advance notice today alone I received four separate schedule change notifications within a two-hour time frame. I have no doubt a review of the automatic alert mail system will reveal this is a common occurrence for all officers. Despite concern for my own personal wellbeing, and the fact that I have had more than one panic attack following interactions with Bad Boss I have endured my time with the company over a sense of obligation to James Sullivan who has been one of the best supervisors I’ve had the pleasure of working under in my professional life. However, as Mr. Sullivan is preparing to leave the company and I have been fortunate enough to find employment elsewhere I am providing this notice of resignation. Due to Bad Boss’s previous behavior and boast and Mr. Harleys’ apparent willingness to approve the behavior by failing to condemn it I will view any future contact from them as harassment. \n\n&gt; Copies of all calls and text messages, as well as any corroborating contemporaneous text messages or recordings I have with other St. George employees will be provided to HR upon request. As of the sending of this message my key to the office building has been slid under the door to John Harley’s office. I will however retain any uniforms I have acquired during my time with the company as I have paid for them via a $5 deduction from every paycheck that was never mentioned or explained. My correct physical address (and not the one to which my last several paystubs have been mailed to without my consent) can be obtained by HR if necessary by contacting me at this email address.\n\n&gt; Sincerely;\n\n&gt; Isa ap Eirias\n\n&gt; St. George employee from 09/02/17-05/23/18\n&gt; \n\nI am not the first guard this week to have done this. Of the three people that were trained to do the Patrol route I was actually the last of three to resign. My friend tendered his resignation last week and the cop who worked for the company part time tendered his monday citing that he was shifting to full time duty, and noting that he was going to be filing a review of Bad Boss's criminal record and his husbands apparent abuse of authority as a state trooper Sergeant to have charges removed in his resignation. He actually went a step past what either of us could do and after talking with colleagues in the police department included a full copy of all charges that6 have been filed and dropped pre-trial against Bad Boss.\n\nThe charges include some pretty major issues- Felony theft of a police officer badge, two instance of impersonating an officer, attempted kidnapping, and a few other things that really left us wondering how he could qualify as a security guard or even own a firearm.\n\nFor my part- I start training Monday with a new company, along with my old supervisor and my friend. One of the biggest perks of the new company aside from being promised a consistent schedule is that unlike the previous one which only allowed armed officers to carry a gun, all armed officers are required to carry restraints and at least one non-lethal weapon and they will pay for any and all training needed.\n\nEveryone whose quite in the last month has been fielding calls from the HR department for about three days now.",

Naturally, in making new acquaintances we got chatty. We had set break. The instructor was ahead in teaching decided to take 5. I was chatting with a candidate when I overheard the instructor and another candidate discussing, what I thought, were methods of removing a person from being in contact with you.\n\nThe instructor gathered everyones attention and said \"I'll demonstrate this but I need a volunteer.\" Being the generous person I am I volunteered myself. This is the moment I heard my shift partner say \"Nawh NewNewkid don't do it.\" I disregarded this vital utterance and carried on. Clearly he was paying attention.\n\nThe instructor approached me and grabbed my right arm. He explained \"I got this arm in case you lose consciousness.\" I did not realize until this point, that I had no idea what I already verbally agreed to. I began to question what heinous act he was about to commit and said \"Ok. Wai...\"\n\nAnd then I woke up. I could hear the hushed \"Oh shit\" and the diabolical ringing in my left ear. The side of my head was on fire and the instructor was standing over top of me. \"Yup, that one got 'em good\".\n\nTurns out, I agreed to allow the UoF instructor to target a cluster of nerve endings in the side of my neck just below my ear; and slam that shit with a hammer fist.\n\nTL;DR volunteered myself to be knocked out via hammer fist to a nerve cluster by a trained professional",

        "text": "Edit: Just realized the title didn't get updated. The names I originally used were close to real names, so I edited them all. Except in the title.  Derp\n\nTo start with, first time posting here, and from mobile, so possible crap formatting.  If more obfuscation than is provided is required, please, let me know. Be forewarned, this one's fairly long, as I gave as much description as I could without giving away PII.\n\nAll members of this tale are entirely fictional, and definitely not in any way inspired at all in the least by an event on my- ah, the storyteller's post this afternoon.\n\nWith that, our cast du jour.  \nTerry - poor sap who brought it all on himself.  \nStevie - poor sap who just wanted something to drink.  \nRanger Rick - local cashier and primary hand of Justice. Think Rocket Raccoon, but not quite as short.  \nMarty - storyteller's supervisor.  \nMe - yours truly, the storyteller of the moment\n\nTo the story.  To set the scene, I was walking my feet flat guarding a two-building strip mall with a gas station on one end when I hear a commotion toward the far end.  I stepped out of the bug cellular store and started to walk toward it when I saw a fella groping his way along the building feeling for the wall.  He cleared the sushi place and the salon, and hit the ground in front of the doctor's office.  (We have really diverse strip malls in the middle of the country.)  So he's dry heaving and rubbing frantically at his eyes and nose and rest of his upper body, and all I'm hearing is ”Someone pepper sprayed him!”.  I head around the corner of the house place and across the little bit of lot separating the buildings toward the tobacco shop.  I get about halfway between them when Ranger Rick and Stevie popped out the little door to the store's office.  Ranger Rick tells me he just pepper sprayed a guy and I start to put two and two together.  One of the stylists is on the horn with law enforcement, so I call in to Marty to let him know what's shaking on my post.  After waiting about ten-fifteen minutes, during which Terry lays on the tarmac and blubbers, city unit one rolls up on us and the officer starts trying to converse, entirely without result, with Tommy. While this Charlie Foxtrot goes on, city unit two pulls over to the shop to talk to Ranger Rick.  After a few minutes of asking if he could pull out his wallet to check for ID, Terry manages to flop around to where he can get one hand on his wallet hanging half out of his back pocket and kinda slop it into the officer's hand.  We discover he has no ID, which, combined with his obviously-intoxicated state, was part of the reason for this whole fiasco.\n\nAllow me to rewind a moment.  Terry went into the tobacco shop, which also happens to carry some beverages of varying potency in addition to cigarettes.  He was denied service because already drunk and no ID.  Stevie goes in a minute later, buys a bottle of potatoes, and on his way out is viciously set upon by Terry.  Ranger Rick makes a quick trip outside, where he grabs the bottle from Terry and hands it back to Stevie.  Now, here's where Terry's real screw-up occurred.  He decided to try to punching-bag  Ranger Rick's face.  Ranger Rick dodges his swing and whips out his little ace in the hole - a little can of pepper spray he keeps on his person for just such an occasion.  Terry eats pepper cloud, and so we return to the point at which this tale began.\n\nLE calls in a medical unit, but by the time they get there, statements have been taken from Ranger Rick and Stevie, and Terry's next destination was determined to be the county lockup.  City unit three had picked Stevie up a couple blocks east and brought him back to the plaza, you see.  Ranger Rick was brought over to unit one to identify Terry as the guy that had tried to deck him and he had sprayed.  I had started working on a trespass notice (management at my company gets busy when big stacks of fresh trespass notices come in), and my supervisor showed up on scene to figure out what we're needed to provide and what LE already had.  While I gathered more information for the report I still need to write, Marty gave one copy of the notice slip to Terry and explained just what it meant.  Ranger Rick told us that he didn't want Stevie trespassed if we didn't have to, because he's a pretty good customer overall, and regular too. \n\nThe conclusion of all this came out to two potential charges of assault for Terry. There's nothing against Ranger Rick, self-defense being what it is. He got caught in his own cloud - sprayed into the wind - and his eyes were still red and puffy when I saw him just before leaving the site, but he's functional.   Stevie's probably going to put in a brief stint in dryout, one of the officers was pretty insistent of him being over the limit or some such.  Marty got to come out and make another of his dire predictions of impending trouble before going to put a stop to mayhem and discontent on the properties we're contracted with.  I have a report to write and a four-hour shift at a nursing home to do it at.  It's really gonna cut into my gaming time, but since all I have to play on there is a phone, I don't think I'll be missing too much.",

        "text": "This happened last summer. We get on shift, briefing done, day shift has had a good one. We go to dispatch for assignment. We received a call from a visitor of a man on the roof of the parking structure \"acting strange.\"\n\nWe dispatch out, one on vehicle and one on foot. We get there to find a beanpole of a man obviously tweaked out, shirtless, with scraggly hair. It's burning hot, so him being shirtless isn't so strange. But he's got every door of his car wide open, and has a quart of ice cream in his hand. Already, talking loudly to himself, and in between bouts of shouting he's drinking his ice cream like it's a smoothie. All around his vehicle, it appears that he has removed half of its contents and strewn them about in a circle.\n\n\"MAN ALIVE, IT'S HOT OUT HERE!\" he says, to no one in particular.\n\nDispatch calls eyes on over the radio. We're go.\n\nHe sees us and excitedly explains he's there to visit his mother. We talk with him a bit, get him shirted up, and ask that he provide his mother's name. As we call to verify whether she is a patient, he packs all his shit back into his car and closes all the doors.\n\nShe isn't a patient. We advise him to leave. He's tweaking but friendly, accepts this, and goes to open his car. \n\nOnly... It's locked. His keys were inside.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo now he's excitedly coming up with elaborate plans to get back into his car. Breaking it open from below and crawling back up, removing the rear bumper and crowbarring the gate open, a bunch of things. Mind you, he's talking a mile a minute, so we miss most of it.\n\nMy supervisor and I are just staring. He can't afford AAA and we don't have an expense account for that sort of thing. Finally, tweaker shouts, \"I'm just gonna break the window!\" And starts pounding on his rear driver side window, his ice cream slushie flying everywhere. Mind you, it's a Ford Escape. That window is tiny, so even if he managed to pop it open he'd be crawling over glass. We finally step in and advise him that it is probably not a good idea.\n\n-----\n\nWe are at an impasse. We want him to leave, but he can't get into his car. We can't get him a AAA service, but he can't either.\n\nWe don't want to break the window for him, because that is liability city. I jokingly mention to my supervisor, as tweaker is circling his car and giving it a furious death glare, that I left our bolt cutters in the bed of the truck. One thing leads to another, and we end up handing the tweaker the bolt cutters. Usually I'd hate handing a potential weapon to an addict, but he seemed to like us well enough.\n\nFixated on that rear window, he lines up a good swing on it. He screams, \"BATTER UP!\" takes a batting stance, then violently throws our bolt cutters clean through his window. He reaches through the broken glass, grabs them, and starts smashing it against the broken glass to clear it out. And seconds later, before we can stop him... he drops the bolt cutters, picks up his ice cream bucket, backs up, and takes a fucking diving leap into the car through that tiny ass window, ice cream slushie in hand.\n\nWe are horrified, immediately afraid he's gored himself on the glass. Thankfully he knocked the last bit free with his body, now harmlessly half in, half out of the window.\n\n-----\n\nI want to take a moment to remind you, dispatch is watching. The day shift lead is still here, watching, laughing his nuts off. On his camera, he can see tweaker, half in, half out. Tweaker's legs are dangling in the air wildly, noodle grooving.\n\n-----\n\nWe hear him growling and shouting incoherently, his voice muffled by the blanket his face is now buried in. He sounds like an angry Diablo gremlin, flailing wildly as he tries to pull himself into his car.\n\nFinally, he does. Like a snake, he wades his way forward through the garbage, grumbling to himself the whole way. I am trying and failing not to laugh, having to turn away. He gets to the driver seat, loudly screams \"GOT IT!\" and pushes the door open to dangle them. I turn back to see him already turning the car on.\n\nHe pulls out of the stall and rolls down the window. He thanks us, calls us gentlemen, and says \"just for you guys, I won't play any music until I'm on the freeway. I promise.\" He starts to drive. I call out, \"wait!\"\n\nHe slams on the brakes, reverses hard, and says \"what, boss?\"\n\nI say, \"when you get to the gate, press the button and we'll let you out.\"\n\n\"Okaaaay,\" he says, already driving off. He gets halfway around the first bend then reverses again. \"Oh, I'll check for momma at the nursing home.\" I say, \"okay, you do that.\" He goes, finally rounding the bend. It is at this point that I am doing my best not to die laughing and finally let it go. I had to clean up glass but it was so worth it. But that's not where the story ends.\n\n-----\n\nA few minutes later, the valet attendant down at the entrance calls to report someone who ran through the gate with their car. It was tweaker dude of course. But the attendant was present, saying \"hang on, I'll get the gate.\" Tweaker dude said \"I gotta be some place, you've not five seconds! Four! Three! Two!\"\n\nHe floored it, turning our gate into a very expensive paperweight. He laid on the horn the whole way until he was off property.\n\n-----\n\nI'm sure someone will call fake, but they've never met a determined tweaker before. They are either really scary, really insane, or both. This guy was both. This remains the best fucking call I've ever had in my security career, and I really doubt anything will top it. Haven't seen the guy since, but I'm so glad he came looking for his mom.",

        "text": " This is a follow up because some people never learn to this tale:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/8d5hb3/call_the_cops/\n\nThis is a long one and I apologise for any typos as my wrist is a bit stiff at the moment.\n\nA few things have happened since D2 decided to give me a headache- I got to actually meet the property owner do to her deciding to see why exactly there was a sudden decline in the number of reports since I took over by parking her can in the firelane- not knowing who she was I asked her to move to a parking spot was given the common line of \"I'm just picking up an order\" and about 10 minutes later once my remport hit her email inbox she introduced herself and we had a chat. This resulted in a few nice changes including her renegotiating the contract with us:\n\n-I now have the number for the towing company she has a contract with and permission to call when I deem it necessary- like the panel van that had been sitting in the same spot for 5 months and nobody knew the story behind.\n\n-My shift got an extra hour tacked on to the front so it's now 6 hours instead of 5 which means more money for only marginally more work\n\n-We have new window stickers for problem vehicles. I no longer have to say when the tow truck will arrive or anything else like who tagged the car. All the new stickers have is a spot to say WHY your subject to towing.\n\nThe last few weeks have been pretty much gravy work- I show up, weathers been nice so I take a seat on the bench outside with a book and wait through the shift till the last two stores close, then sit in my personal vehicle and watch netflix and do random exterior patrols before heading home. I think I reported maybe two vehicles and only had to talk to a few people. Tonight though- well the dumbass 2 from my last tale came back. and once again parked in front of a no parking sign- this time though it wasn't for convenience as he ended up going to the pizza place about 30ft away. I tried to be polite and pretend I didn't recognize him and was rewarded with much the same response.\n\nI nod and smile and make a beeline to my car and grab the stickers. I look up the previous report (surprisingly \"driver became belligerent\" isn't a common phrase in old reports so a quick search only threw up one result) verify it is the same guy and car, pull the plate number from the old report and copy it into the new one and take a photo again before filling out the stickers. I filled out three, I've been told I can only put one reason on a sticker so he got one for parking in the fire lane, one for blocking handicap access, and one for parking in an oncoming traffic lane because at this point I wanted him to waste time removing them- all three got placed on the windshield so they would block the view of anyone driving. One quick call to the towing company who usually take about half an hour to show up and I sit back and wait for the fire works. Apparently he decided to order in person and wait until his food was done because the Truck driver was part way through hooking everything up when Dummy came out with a stack of pizzas. The look of shock on his face was priceless.\n\n&gt;Dummy: Get the fuck away from my car!\n\nThe tow truck driver to his credit looks at the guy, glanced back at me, and then slapped a magnetic light on the roof of the guys mercedes as though nothing was happening. I'm just going to call the driver Mike on account of being a Dresden files fan.\n\n&gt;Mike: Hey I'm just doing my job. You want me to unhook you it's a $300 fee since I already started.\n\n&gt;Dummy: Fuck that! Get your faggot hands off my car or I'm gonna beat your ass.\n\nOh hey, he's not even demanding to call the cops this time. Maybe someone saw his last video and pointed out the cops can't do anything.\n\n&gt;Mike: No can do, company policy once we start hooking up we can only drop if it's in the yard or we get paid. I can do cash or credit if you want.\n\n&gt;Dummy: Fucker I ain't paying you shit. \n\n&gt;Mike: Well best of luck then, you can pick your car up in the morning. Feel free to leave a complaint with the manager then.\n\nAt this point both store managers have come outside to see what's going on and my boss has shown up for his daily site inspection. Dummy however doesn't realize his performance has drawn an audience and I'm sitting off to the side praying he doesn't follow through on the threat to attack Mike.\n\n&gt;Dummy: Fuck that shit, you can't tow me if I'm gone!\n\nMike just stares as the guy jumps in starts up his car and tries to drive off- despite the fact that the back is currently raised up on a metal bar. With not tracktion the tires simply spin in the air. My boss (the bad one, not the one I've known for years) finally decides to get out of his car and see what the hell is going on.\n\n&gt;JBad boss: Isn't that the last car you reported?\n\n&gt;Me: Yep, the truck got here before he came out. I'm not sure if I should get involved at this point. Guy seemed to have things pretty well in hand till a second ago.\n\n&gt;BB: Just go get the cop from the grocery store, tell him you've got a guy out here refusing to let his car be towed I'll see what I can do about this.\n\nI run off, track down the perpetually bored officer that's guaranteed to be at any store in this particular chain and gave him a brief explanation of the situation and asked if he could come smooth things out. For the record, I hate Mr.Dumbass and bad boss. We get back outside and I realize there's a problem. My boss had his gun drawn with the guy on the ground and mike had a hand clapped to his shoulder. The cop appropriately responded by pulling his gun and aiming at my boss.\n\nThere was a tense few minutes following that, my boss ended up having to hand his gun over to the cop. Bad boss had decided to go for the nuclear stupid option of brandishing his gun and demanding the guy get out. When he finally did get out Mike had gone back to hooking up the guys car so it was safe to tow down the highway and Dumbass had escalated his protest by stabbing Mike with a pocket knife. Bad boss responded by tackling him and then planting his foot in his back in true action movie hero style. \nMy shift ended up getting cut short as I had to give a statement to the next cop that showed up, then go back to the office, fill out a report for the corporate office and HR to evaluate, write up a fresh report for our client who's probably going to be pissed at everyone, had to write a report for our insurance company since I was at the site when someone pulled a weapon, and I'm probably going to have to sit down with my regional manager next week to explain everything to him.  Personally I'm just glad that I wasn't the idiot that pulled a weapon first and that dumbass ended up not only getting his car towed away but also get's to spend at least a few hours in jail thanks to his wisdom in stabbing someone.",

I was doing a mobile patrol with my coworker and after doing about 2 laps, we saw the same BMW (obviously) parked on a fire route. Keep in mind, there was a fire route sign right beside him.\n\nWe pull up next to him, ask him to roll his window down and I tell him \"Hey buddy, just letting you know you can't be parked here, it's a fire route.\"\n\nHis reply was \"I didn't see a sign and I'm not parked though, I'm just waiting for my friend to use the ATM\".\n\nI really wasn't having it that day so I tell him, \"Look to your right and is your car in drive, reverse or park?\"\n\nHe answers \"Park, why?\"\n\nI look at my coworker with just like pure frustration and disappointment, look over at the guy to shake my head, he clues in what just happens and then just bolts off.

        "text": "Hey guys, ex mall cop Sierra9 back again.\n\nAnyone who has worked with escalators and travellators knows how dangerous they truly are. These are industrial machines that will seriously harm you if you don't use them properly. I've witnessed and attended enough trips, falls,  confinements, entanglements, and entrapments to know this.\n\nFor reference, travellators are the ramp style, while escalators are the stair style. My site had both. Trolleys, strollers, wheelchairs, etc, were not permitted on escalators under any circumstances.\n\nSo myself and another guard had just left the security office to attend a minor job. We start heading up the escalators when we see a woman coming down the other side with a trolley. She was already on the escalator, so there wasn't anything we could do, except warn her when she passed us. So we did. \"excuse me ma'am, it's very dangerous to take trolleys down the escalators, would you mind using the travellators or elevators in future?\". All we got in reply was a roll of the eyes, and something muttered under her breath.\n\nI kept an eye on her to make sure she got off safely, and what do you know? The front wheels of the trolley got stuck in the comb at the bottom, and she fell back while the escalator carried her under the trolley. The second I saw her fall, I sprinted to the top of my escalator and hit the Emergency stop before walking back down to make sure she was uninjured, and collect details for the mountain of paperwork I'd soon have to fill out. But she was nowhere to be seen. Must have bolted from the scene to avoid the embarrassment.\n\nOther guard and I restarted the escalator and proceeded to the initial job, having a good laugh along the way.",

When i come on i work with the 2nd shift gatehouse person for several hours then the night guard comes on.\n\nSo this night im checking the elevators in the condos making sure the emergency call buttons work. Simple procedure, press the button, wait for the 3rd party company to answer, verify they can hear me and i can hear them and end the call...rinse and repeat 20 times.\n\nI discover an elevator that is not working. I check the floors and make sure nothing is holding the elevator up and see nothing. I radio the gatehouse and give them the address of the building and ask them to call the repair company. I go on with the rest of my work and am waiting for her to radio me to tell me they came. \n\nIts not unusual for it to take several hours for the repair people to get there due to distance away or they might be busy also. About 4 hours later the gatehouse calls me and said the repair people stopped at the gatehouse and said there was nothing wrong with the elevator, it was working fine. yes i am a bit upset she never let me know they came on property.\n\nI thought to myself well maybe it reset itself... but the little voice in my head kept yelling at me that something was not right and i went back to the condo and checked the elevator and it still was not working. I radioed the gatehouse and asked her what address she told them to go to and she gave me an address that was 2 buildings down!! \n\nI explained that it was not the correct address, and gave her the correct one again. (ill point out that when i relay information i always say it at least 2 times because i know that sometimes radios might mess up) She keys the radio laughing and says \"gee, i guess i gave them the wrong address...\"\n\nagain the elevator people show up and she never lets me know they come back. she again calls me on the radio and says that they could not find anything wrong with the elevator. I verified AGAIN the address and she said \"oh, wow...guess i did it again\" and laughs.\n\n\nSo now, because of her, we now have to contact the maintenance supervisor for the community and he will say if we call or not.",

        "text": "So I used to be a mall cop. It wasn't a /huge/ mall, but it's definitely the biggest independently owned centre in this city. I have countless stories from this site, but here's one that stands out. (mobile post so excuse formatting)\n\nIt was a late night shopping night, and I was the  shift supervisor. I was patrolling the floor when I look into one of the high end clothing stores and identify two female POIs that we had dealt with a few days prior. I notify the other two guards on shift (one to positively identify and monitor via CCTV and the other to attend and assist).\n\nThe guard on CCTV matches the POIs to stillshots taken from the other day, and the assisting guard arrives. Shortly after the POIs exit the store and walk into the nearby department store. We follow at a distance and monitor, observing the POIs picking up items and placing them in bags. We continue to monitor as they approach the self checkouts to see if they actually pay for the goods or not, when I get a call on the site phone from the dollar store downstairs.\n\nMe: \"Centre security, Sierra9 speaking, how can I help?\"\nDS: \"Yeah hi is this security? We just had a father catch his kid shoplifting and he wants you to come down\"\n\nSo I cancel our current task of trying to catch these known shoplifters red handed and immediately go down to the dollar store with the other guard to sort out that situation. When we got there, I did the usual thing of introducing myself, getting details, and asking what happened.\n\nVery quickly I found out the \"father\" wasn't the father of \"that little shit head\", as he called him, and was just a regular centre customer who walked by at the right moment. The kid was about 17, and had indicators that he may have been homeless or struggling financially.\n\nMe: \"so what exactly happened?\"\nFather-not-father: \"I caught this little shit head stealing things that didn't belong to him!\"\nMe: \"and what did you see him take?\"\nFNF: \"that bag of chips right there\"\nMe (to shop staff): \"what's the value of the item taken?\"\nStaff: \"about $2\"\nMe: \"are you willing to press charges?\"\nStaff: \"no, not for a bag of chips\"\nMe (to FNF): \"So what outcome were you hoping to achieve today?\" (this is a genuine question I ask of anyone who requests security attendance)\nFNF: \"I want you to arrest this little shit and call the police! He took something that doesn't belong to him!\"\n(kid had enough of the insults and began talking back to him and they both started shouting abuse and threats at each other. I promptly got FNF to step aside to talk one-to-one)\nMe: \"sir, I did not observe an offence take place, so I will not be arresting him. The tenant does not wish to press charges, so I won't be calling the police. He is not known to us, so this will be considered his first offence and he will be given a warning and instructed to leave for the day, but beyond that, we will not pursue this matter any further\"\nFTN: \"he's a thief! If you don't punish him now he'll keep stealing. What are you going to do then huh?\"\nMe: \"if he steals again, we will deal with in accordance with our policies and procedures. This is his first offence, and an extremely minor one at that\"\nFNF: \"I did security for 15 years I know all the rules! Do your job or he'll keep doing it!\"\nMe: \"sir, if you've truly been doing this for 15 years, you'd know that you have effected an arrest the second you put your hands on him. It's your responsibility to arrange handover to police, not ours. We are not taking this matter any further. If you want to make a complaint about my decision, you can speak to my manager during regular business hours.\"\nFNF: \"you bet I will. Say goodbye to your job\"\n\nFollowing the conversation I spoke to the kid who stated this was his first offence, he was having issues at home and only stole because he was hungry. He appeared genuinely remorseful, and said he'd never steal again. We asked him to leave for the day. Never had another problem with him since, and my boss never received a complaint from FNF.",

        "text": "Sorry for the long post, I had some ranting to do. TL;DR below.\n\nOkay so background I guess. I work security for a shipping warehouse. My main job is making sure that the only people in the building are employees or authorized contractors. My secondary job is loss prevention/contraband detection. Tertiary to that is making sure there's no suspicious activity outside on our *private property*. And then the RF units the employees use are kept behind security to make sure they're kept track of but that's kind of loss prevention. \n\nAnyway, our cameras have been down for MONTHS. This means I can do access control and loss prevention, but I can't see anything outside of my immediate eyesight. I'm also not allowed to go on patrols if I'm the only guard here (which I often am, and if I'm not the only guy then my relief is). No leaving the desk unattended. This means that if there's any suspicious activity on the property, and there's only one guard here, he may not even know about it and even if he does, all he can do is call our sup. Who also happens to often be the only guard in his facility because we have frequent calloffs, so he can't do anything half the time either. \n\nWhen they first went down, IT said they'd be back up momentarily. They were just switching servers, everything should be fine. Well, that didn't happen. I texted my sup every day for days, still nothing got done. Apparently the cameras are viewable on every other client computer but ours, no one realizes the urgency. Fast forward 3 months...\n\nWe've alerted our Sup, our Account Manager, our Field Sup, the IT guy. Nothing. Apparently our Account Manager never told the Branch Manager. Nor our security liaison with our client. So our security liaison finally finds out we can't view the cameras from our desk, freaks out on us about why no one told him. \"I dunno, dude. We went up our chain of command as far as we're allowed, if they didn't do their due diligence we can't be held responsible.\" So he emails our Branch Manager. Two weeks later, still nothing. \n\nAt this point we've had multiple issues with lone guards not being able to see the back lot, and we've been doing exterior patrols every 15 minutes all day due to suspicious activity at other posts that was predicted to carry to ours. But since we couldn't *see* outside, we had to *be* outside. No patrols while employees are on breaks, either, and any time a guard is not in the back lot we're completely blind there.\n\nSo me and my afternoon guy/relief have been kvetching about it for a while, and our liaison has to come over for unrelated reasons and we kinda wind up kvetching about it to him. He says he'll talk to IT in the morning. I said, for about the third time yesterday, \"it'll take about two seconds. The computer is still trying to log in to the old server. Either we need new credentials or he needs to instruct the computer to connect to the new server instead of the old one, but I dunno why he hasn't just done it already.\"\n\nWelp, today I'm here with my morning guy, I get up to get a sandwich cause I'm feeling like I've got low blood sugar. Come back to the IT guy typing in the \"directory\" field of our camera login widget. Two minutes later, BOOM. Cameras up. Just like I'd been saying all day yesterday. I had even ranted to my boyfriend about this. The second I saw the cameras spring to life, I texted my afternoon guy and my boyfriend the same victory/\"I told you so\" text.\n\nTL;DR cameras have been down for 3 months. I know how to fix it but not the directory names. IT guy fixes it exactly how I said he would need to. *WHY DID THIS TAKE 3 MONTHS!?*\n\nUPDATE: Our security Liaison just came up to ask us for all of our documentation on this issue  (sadly there is none as our sup comes by at the end of every month and collects all of our paperwork, so we've started fresh) and to ask which sups knew, so we gave him names. He now intends to chew out all of our superiors for 1) not telling him, and 2) not doing anything about it. This'll be fun.",

        "text": "(I originally posted this in r/MaliciousCompliance and was informed that this sub existed, and that I should post it here.)\n\nI work security for a private business campus that has venues that are often rented by outside groups. One particularly large hall was rented by a local church group and we sold their tickets at the box office immediately in front of the venue. Without going into boring detail, there was only one way into the hall for the general public but numerous exits with cameras everywhere. Parking is free in all three of our parking decks, except in clearly marked reserved spaces, which will be important soon.\n\nWhile visitors were still arriving for the event, our dispatch center received a call from our largest campus tenant complaining that a car was parked in one of their 24/7 reserved spaces and they need it moved asap. This company pays for these spaces and is constantly using them at all hours of the day and on weekends, which is why we have numerous highly visible signage for this row of spaces warning people of this fact and that towing is enforced.\n\nWe reviewed camera footage and saw that the owner was a woman dressed in fine Sunday clothes that were an almost painful shade of lime green with a matching hat. This would have been enough to identify her even in our large hall, but we then noticed that she bypassed the ticket line and made her way to one of the venue exit doors. She stayed there several minutes and, when one of the cleaning staff exited, she slipped in behind them. (We're still not sure how she knew she could do this, btw.)\n\nAs the supervisor on duty, I entered the hall and found her in one of the front rows sitting in a group of people. She saw me coming in my security uniform and immediately scrunched up her face.\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, can I-\"\n\nHer, interrupting me: \"Now I juss sat down. What is it you want?\"\nShe was already on the defensive and loud.. Not a sign of innocence in my experience.\n\nMe: \"I'm with campus security and I need to ask-\"\n\nHer, cutting me off again: \"What you need to do is leave me alone. I'm sitting with my family and we're here to enjoy my nephew's concert. Ain't nothing so important you rent-a-cops need to be botherin' me like this.\"\n\nMe: \"Actually it is important. If you wouldn't mind coming with me, we can talk in the aisle and-\"\n\n(Note: she thinks I'm here because she didn't buy a ticket but I don't care about that. I'm trying to tell her about her car before we have to tow it. This is her only chance to move it herself.)\n\nHer: \"No, you ain't kicking me out of here at my own nephew's church concert.\"\nNow she starts avoiding eye contact with me.\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, I'm not here about how you got inside this hall, I'm-\"\n\nHer, raising her voice even more: \"I don't know what you're talking about but you NEED. TO LEAVE ME. THE HELL. ALONE.\"\n\nAt this point it was so comical that I remember getting the biggest smile on my face and telling her \"That's all I needed to hear. Enjoy your show.\"\n\nI left and had her car towed immediately. Two hours later she reported her car stolen to our security desk. The desk officer informed her that she parked in a reserved spot and that security had tried to make contact with her before the show began, according to our log. She loudly demanded to speak to whoever was in charge and that's when I came around the corner and introduced myself. The look on her face was priceless and she didn't say another word as I gave her the information for the tow company's lot, which was closed by that time.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8frtfp/she_didnt_want_to_hear_about_her_car_being_towed/",

        "text": "Hey guys, im wondering if this problem is unique to my brand of security,or am I just going insane?!\n\nMost of my relief officers lie through their teeth!\n\nI work contracted security for a retailer in the UK. Ive had my own site for 3 years, but due to changes within the structure, i come into contact with a lot of relief guys. So far I count 4 cage fighter, 6 bouncers, 2 ex special forces, 1 being recuited for the SAS, 1 ex private security in Afghanistan, and 1 Master Mechanic at the age of 19.\n\nAnd then theres the ones that blatantly make up shit. \"I was threatened by a guy last night with a knife\\bottle\\beatdown so i wrestled the guy to the ground\\kicked it out his hand etc.\" But I have 3 cameras that overlook the CCTV station. You were stood there all night.......\n\nI had one guy argue with my coworker and friend, whos been in the game for as long as I have, that all security decisions are ours, WE (low level security guards) tell the CLIENTS (store managers with a wealth of experience and years on their stores) what to do etc. Because that would end well wouldnt it?!\n\nBut this next one takes the cake: the same guy recounted an entire conversation with a department manager on site. It basically amounted to the manager saying \"ive got a DEGREE, I know my job,you do what I tell you!\" by his account. Now I know this manager. Not VERY well, but well enough to know that he wouldnt ever talk to anybody like that, hes a nice guy, as most of them are on that site. The next day, we asked the manager if it happened. What do you think the answer was boys n girls?!\n\nAnother story he told me, was that a store manager at another site told him to stock a shelf. I asked him who said store manager was, as they rotate every so often, so I know most of them from different stores. \"Some big tall woman\"\n\nFunny, that sites manager is neither tall nor is he a woman..........\n\nIts getting a bit ridiculous now, I can see why management are at the end of their role when it comes to recruiting. The experienced guys like myself are dropping in number because we're sick of the new guys stirring shit, and they just replace us with more new guys!",

Young kids who would tour around putting on all the fun kiddy shows that cost you more than you can afford.\n\nMy first time dealing with them was when they came down for a month one summer to practice for a show they will be doing later that year. The bus pulls up and out comes this mob of disheveled 20ish kids looking like zombies as they were herded into the hotel to get room assignments.\n\nThey were so lethargic it was almost pitiful...until one notice the bar... and the bar was open. Suddenly there was singing and dancing and general merriment to be had at the sight of the oasis!\n\nOnce the rooms were assigned they took their stuff to their rooms and then, en mass, hit the bar like locus on a cornfield. The poor bartender was by her self and was hoping to get out at a decent time...not gonna happen this night...or any further night they were there.\n\nI can say i only saw them sober 3 times in the entire month they were there. rest of the time they were hammered.\n\nI gave them the nickname of Disney on the Rocks.\n\nSpeaking of nicknames, i gave one of the young lady's a suitable nickname... and here is how she earned her nickname.\n\nHer story is simple and sad really. See she came in from practice and had her arm around one of the male actors and as she walked by the front desk she stated that when she goes out on these trips she picks a guy and that's who she is with. Poor guy...\n\nIts at this time i must add that the hotel is close to the international airport and has contracts with various airlines to provide rooms for the flight crews who work the last fights. One pilot who was one of the nicest guys you could ever meat would call the hotel and speak to the restaurant and let them know how long it will be before he gets there and would ask for his dinner to be ready for him when he gets there. No biggy, easy to do and no hassle. All he ever gets is French Fries.\n\nSo this night pilot and his crew show up and get into their rooms and come back to the restaurant/bar and begin to relax and enjoy their meals.\n\nSuddenly the young lady from the road show and her chosen boytoy (?) come down and walk to the restaurant. She sees the pilots and crew eating and makes a beeline for our friendly pilot who had no idea she was coming. She reaches him and puts her arm around his shoulder, snuggles close to him, and begins to eat his fries.\n\nThe bartender, crew, and I are flabbergasted at this move that we have no words to say. \n\nThe pilot looks at her in disbelief and says \"well hello perfect stranger who i have never met before, please help yourself to some of my fries!\"\n\nWithout missing a beat the guy who she came down with folded his arms and said \"well, hell. if i knew all it took was french fries, i could have saved some money!\"\n\nIt was at that moment she earned her new nickname...Fry Whore.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "One of the companies I work for does occasional work for a hotel in the area. I've done a couple shifts there, the last one being on a weekend when there was a youth basketball tournament &amp; many teams stayed at this hotel.      \n&amp;nbsp;    \nMe: 40-something, white, college degrees, lives in Milwaukee      \nPipsqueak: maybe 8, black, hopefully still in school, lives in Chicago; dad is a Chicago cop     \n&amp;nbsp;     \nHow did I know dad is a Chicago cop, you ask?     \nPipsqueak showed me dad's badge, only claimed it was his own (as in, Pipsqueak was a cop).    \nAlso claimed that the other boys with him were his sons.    \nI told him I hoped he works with the vice squad, because he doesn't look old enough to have children.        \n&amp;nbsp;     \nMostly this group of boys wasn't being all that bad or disruptive, except that they ignored curfew &amp; ran around the atrium.     \n*(This is one of those hotels with a HUGE atrium, going up all the levels, and walkways around the edges to get to the rooms. I think they should hold a paper airplane contest.)*    \n&amp;nbsp;    \nAnyway, the personally annoying thing about Pipsqueak was that every time we saw each other, he'd say, \"hey, security - I'm gonna bake you!\".     \nI'm guessing from context it's meant to be a threat.    \nAnd if that came from one of the older boys I might be a little worried.     \nOn the street I'd definitely be worried.    \nBut Pipsqueak I could almost carry under one arm.      \n&amp;nbsp;     \nWhen I walked the group of boys to Pipsqueak's dad, I explained what the ~~little psychopath in training~~ adorable tyke had said about being a police officer.... and that it's a felony in our state.     \nHe laughed &amp; said it's a felony in Illinois too, but kept his badge in his pocket after that.

        "text": "*Names have been changed to protect the innocent and the moronic alike.*\n\nSo to be clear I don't really have a designated post with my company, I'm the guy that get's called when someone pulls a no call/no show, I cover sites for other guards when they are sick or when we are short handed because of various stupidity, and occasionally because after seven months I've worked literally every site we have a contract with and a few emergency jobs I get to train the newbies. The only issues I've had come from dealing with a field supervisor who's a living example of the peter principle and the main one was finally resolved by me being enough of an asshole to show up for a shift with my cane (That's a story for another time.) My most recent post has been for about 2 weeks now which is a record for me.\n\nThe current post is a short five hour shift watching a parking lot for people who don't understand what the \"No parking any time\" signs mean. My post orders are basically to fill out a report on the mobile app the company uses anytime a car parkes in the area, take a picture, fill out one of those annoying bright orange stickers telling them if it's not moved by a certain time it will be towed and slap it on their window. Honestly I'm a lot more lax about this than I'm supposed to be. The only stores in the strip mall open during my shift are a pizza place and a wing shop so I usually don't push it if someone pulls up and runs in unless they are sitting there for a long time, I'll do things like ask them to move if there is someone in the car, do a trip around the building to make sure nobody is using the dumpsters for their household trash and then start filling out the report which I don't even send in if they leave before I finish, and I usually wait a few minutes to slap the sticker on because they are a bitch to remove. To make my job even easier if I'm off doing a patrol and don't see it the managers for both shops will relay to the person that they will get a ticket if they don't move.\n\nMost people don't have an issue and move their cars, some people just ignore me, every now and then I'll have someone get pissy about me taking photos of their car and then settle down when I point out their on private not public property and I'm acting at the direction of the property owner. I've only had two people raise a serious fuss over it.\n\nLast night I had a guy get pissy about it and demand to see my ID (by state law I have to show the card that verifies I'm licensed to work as security or a PI, it's got my picture, name, DOB and when the license was issued, on the back it has what weapons I'm certified to carry which most people never look at) I handed my Id he took a picture thinking it would bother me (there is a searchable database with the same things so it doesn't bother me. Then the conversation took a bad turn:\n\n&gt;dummy 1: You can't just go taking pictures of peoples cars, what would happen if that flipped my switch?\n\n&gt;Me: It's happened before which is why every guard posted here is armed. (I usually wear a light coat so my gun isn't noticeable unless you realize the heavy belt I'm wearing has a snap instead of a buckle.)\n\n&gt;D1&gt; Oh yeah well I'm armed to!\n\nAt this stupid comment the guy starts leaning across to the passenger seat and reaching for his glove box and before I realize it my hand isn't hanging at my side and I've not only hit the release for my gun but also the safety.\n\n&gt;Me&gt; That's nice but I don't want to see it. If your hand comes out of there holding anything were both going to have really bad nights.\n\nGuy sped off shouting a few comments about my parents and I was prepared to file the incident under \"people are stupid.\" Aside from telling my supervisor about it this so he could flag the report incase the guy looked up the company and filed a complaint I didn't bother with anything else.\n\nThen we had tonight which is probably the closest I've ever come to wanting to beat the hell out of a stranger. I'm talking to the wing shop manager on his smoke break while he's letting me know they are getting their delivery guys car toppers so we can spot them and maybe start driving home that the fire lane isn't a parking spot (The recommendation of papering all their windows with stickers was given) when a guy pulls up, shuts off his engine and gets out- not only directly in front of the no parking sign but also blocking the little wheelchair access ramp.\n\n&gt;Me: Excuse me sir would you mind moving your car to a parking space? That's actually a fire lane.\n\n&gt;Dummy 2: F*** you write me a damn ticket if you have a problem with it.\n\nAnd just like that any possibility of me being nice has vanished the manager sighs waves me off and goes inside to deal with the guy while I start filling out my report. I walk around to the back of the car so I can fill out the license plate info on my form(and make a note he has a reflective cover over it so it can't be photographed) note the car is a nice new Mercedes R350 and then D2 makes a reappearance and right away I can tell my night has gone to hell- he's got his phone held up and is obviously recording me.\n\n&gt;D2: WHAT THE F*** ARE YOU DOING TO MY CAR!\n\n&gt;Me: Unfortunately anytime a car parks here I'm required to fill out a report. Since you don't have a front plate I have to get the information I need from the back of it\n\n&gt;D2: YOU SEE THIS! THIS WANNABE COP IS HARASSING ME CAUSE i WON'T MOVE MY CAR\n\nAnd just like that I snap a quick picture of the car with a clear view of the no parking sign and the guy standing between them with his phone out and discreetly start the audio recorder on my phone I also realize D2 is about and has at least 2 inches and 50lbs on me so I now have a 6'2\" 250lb black man cussing and yelling at me in a predominantly black neighborhood while I'm a white guy wearing a uniform and I start praying he doesn't make this any worse.\n\n&gt;Me: As I pointed out when you parked sir and as the sign right here states this is a no parking zone. I don't think doing my job and reporting this to the owner of the private property your on qualifies as harassment.\n\n&gt;D2: GET THE F*** OUT OF HERE, YOU AINT A REAL COP YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING. YOU GOT A PROBLEM CALL A REAL COP TO DO HIS JOB. YOU DON'T GET AWAY FROM MY CAR I'M GONNA BEAT YO A**.\n\n&gt;Me: Look I'm just doing my job. I asked you politely to move your car and you refused so I have to write a it up and report it to the property owner. I don't see any reason to waste the police time with this as I just finished my report and sent it off to the-\n\n&gt;D2: F*** YOU, YOU FAKE A** COP (okay seriously this guy needs to expand his vocabulary or something) CALL THE DAMN POLICE  I WANT TO HEAR THEM SAY I'M PARKED ILLEGALLY. LOOK AT THIS CHICKEN S*** SHAKING F***ING COWARD IS AFRAID OF ME.\n\nAt this point I've been outside in 32 degree weather wearing nothing but my company branded windbreaker and polo with slacks on and every instinct in my head is telling me this guy is about to take a swing at me and yeah not ashamed, I was shaking from cold and adrenaline and clenching my fist trying to keep from being the one who swung first with a small voice in the back of my head wanting to know why I don't just take a swing at him. Instead I took a few steps back so I was in the line of sight for the cameras at the grocery store, could calm down, get some breathing room, settle into a resting stance, but mainly because it put me within reach of my car and grabbing my baton off the dash if needed instead of using the gun that company policy says is the only weapon I can carry on my belt.\n\n&gt;Me: Look I'm sorry if me doing my job offends you. If you really think this is an issue for the cops to deal with then please call them.\n\n&gt;D2: I AIN'T CALLING TO GODD*** COPS YOUR THE ONE WITH THE ISSUE YOU F***ING CALL THEM.\n\nI really don't want to call cops, yeah it's a waste of their time but anytime we have to call the cops we have to fill out the paperwork for our corporate insurance, fill out another report for HR, and we have to get the cops to give us a copy of their report. I'm lazy and hate paperwork so filling out 20 pages of paperwork isn't a priority for me. I've done it before and it sucked (again story for another time). D2 however has apparently realized the cap in the car behind me has the same logo as my coat and shirt.\n\n&gt;D2: YOU LIKE TAKING PICTURES OF PEOPLES PLATES? FINE YOU POWER TRIPPIN F***ER I'M GONNA GET YOUR PLATES.\n\nThis amuses me because I haven't updated the address on my registration yet and the houses current residents already shot at one person who claimed they accidentally got lost when they were caught at the end of a half mile long dirt driveway. My brain has finally gotten on board with the idea I don't want to hit or shoot this guy enough that a lightbulb goes off and I hit the speed dial for my immediate supervisor and put it on speaker so he can hear if this guy starts yelling again.\n\n&gt;Supervisor: James speaking what do you need Isa.\n\n&gt;Me: Hey Sergeant Sullivan (we don't actually have ranks but it gave him a clear sign that something was up) I'm at ~~post address~~ and have an individual here that refused to move out of the fire lane whose become extremely belligerent and is threatening violence and demanding I call the cops because I took a picture of his plates for a report.\n\n&gt;Supervisor: Alright I'm on my way.\n\n&gt;D2: F*** THIS, YOU FAKE A** MOTHERF***ING PIG. I GOT YOUR PLATES NOW MY MOM WORKS AT THE CLERK OFFICE I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR ASS LATER.\n\nHe then stomps back to his car and proceeded to speed out leaving behind a cloud of smoke and nearly hitting another car that was leaving the lot.\n\n&gt;Supervisor: So I'm was on my way for a site inspection anyway your going to tell me what the hell just happened right?\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah he just left.\n\nMy supervisor was amused when he got the full story and we both had to laugh when the wing manager came out and admitted that not only did the guy his order after he paid cash for it but *someone* apparently messed up and doubled it.",

Both the gatehouse guard and myself both FINALLY got the people quiet. \n\nShe informs me that golfers playing on the golf course were almost run over by someone driving the cart path in their personal vehicle. She also stated that the law enforcement were notified and they are on the way now.\n\nThe driver was finally made to exit the cart path and then tried to leave the property but was stopped at the back gate.\n\nMy supervisor told me to go to the back gate to be a witness to everything. I get back there and the guy is out of his vehicle talking to the back gate guard. \n\nTurns out he was a visitor who came to see a friend who lives in the community and they went fishing.\n\nAs i watch, i can see him having a bit of an issue in standing still, his body language told me might be impaired.\n\nWhen law enforcement showed up they determined that he was \"unfit to drive\" but were not able to arrest him due to they did not see him behind the wheel of the vehicle. They asked him the standard question of how much did you have to drink and he replied with the standard 1 beer.\n\nLong story short is the resident was called and explained that the guest was unfit to drive home and either they need to drive him home or the guest needs to spend the night. The resident took him home.\n\nBy the time i was able to drive the golf course it was dark so i was not really able to tell if any damage happened or not so when the greens people came in i told them what happened and they said they will go over the course and check it.\n\nJust another Friday the 13th...\n\n",

A week ago, OFC called PD to issue a ban and bar but the subject fled the site. \n\nSubject had a bus ticket this shift and OFC  told him he can stay for the bus and to not drink any alcohol.\n\nAt 19:10 a passenger approached OFC to inform me that the individual has been drinking alcohol. OFC  approached the subject and requested to search his backpack. Subject complied and OFC discovered a full open bottle of Jameson Liquor.  OFC informed subject that possession or consumption of alcohol was not allowed on premise,  and That it would be confiscated.  At this point, subject got visibly upset, started yelling and cursing, stood up and took a fighting stance. OFC  backed up and subject followed. OFC yelled for PD to be called to the ticket agent, and OFC backed up so subject would not be in the middle of other passengers. \n\nOFC  told subject that he needed to leave no less than 20 times, to which subject responded with profanities. At this point, subject tried advancing on OFC. OFC drew OC spray, yelled for subject to leave and subject started  to exit the property. Subject threw a punch at a door next to a passenger, and OFC followed him out of the building. Passengers started going outside to confront subjectn. OFC  told other passengers to go inside while subject kept advancing towards the OFC. OFC decided not to deploy OC spray due to the fact that subject was wearing a hood that was covering his eyes. \n\nOFC  got all of the passengers to go inside the building, and left subject to tell outside and waited for PD to arrive.

        "text": "So I  used to work in an armed response company in 2016 here in South Africa and I particularly enjoyed night shifts just relaxing in my response car parked outside a post office in a very quiet street ,all to myself, waiting for alarms and panics or driving around randomly patrolling my designated neighbourhood. On this particular night (5pm-5am) I was hoping for a quiet shift as I decided to relax in my car after things had quietened down close to midnight, it was approximately 22:00 pm and, to my joy ,it was a stormy night.\n\nSo there I was watching a documentary on my laptop with some coffee along with a pillow I smuggled in every night shift. Enjoying the peace and the sound of rain pattering on the roof.  As expected my colleagues where silent on the radio comms, also left to their own devices, they where probably dozing off or patrolling. \n\nThe documentary was a murder mystery and it got me slightly unnerved, The events that played out in the documentary had me feeling paranoid so I decided to find a better lit parking spot once it ended, unfortunately for me I dozed off. It must have been at least 30 minutes that passed, when I heard panicked shouting on the radio , I was jolted awake. My supervisor was shouting incoherently asking for help. I immediately got the car into motion toward his location, although I didn't know what was going on. \n\nHe eventually calmed down and explained that he had encountered a man walking along a highway covered in blood pushing a cart also dripping blood, when he stopped to investigate the man fled into the bush. Upon closer inspection the cart had something covered in a dirty blanket, which we opened to reveal a naked body of a women,beaten so badly with bones broken from the blunt force trauma. It was dark and the periodic flashes of lightning revealed the corpse. It was a very creepy night, and the police never caught the guy.\n\nhttps://citizen.co.za/news/1095050/trolley-victim-murdered-in-attempted-rape/",

        "text": "I originally posted this to TIFU over a year ago, but figure it deserves a place here. Burner account and vague details for obvious reasons.\n\nSo this all happened at my old job at a security company. One of the \"covert\" sites I used to patrol was an abandoned public sector building. It had been vandalised and broken into numerous times, so there was a fair amount of broken glass on the ground around it. Anyway, I'd worked the site numerous times over the preceding month or so. Wasn't my favourite, but was pretty chill.\n\nThe site happened to be across the street from a government intelligence agency. So almost every day, I'd have federal cops on my site to watch the intel building. A couple times, because I was in plain clothes, they pulled me up to verify that I am indeed the security guard for the site. Fair enough, but otherwise didn't have any issues with them. Even had a few casual conversations with them as I did my routine walk-around.\n\nIn the time I worked that site, I had observed that the feds tend to drive their cars right over a whole lot of broken glass. And here's where the fuck up begins. I had decided on this particular day that I'd do them a courtesy and sweep up the glass so they wouldn't have to drive over it every half hour. I was sweeping for maybe 10 minutes, right behind their marked car, no issues whatsoever. They didn't step out of their car to question me or anything, so surely all is going well. Right?\n\nWrong. After about 10-15 minutes of sweeping, an unmarked 4x4 pulls up and, who I'm assuming was the supervisor of the two feds in the marked car, gets out and starts walking towards me, as the other two get out of the marked car and approach as well.\n\nBefore I even open my mouth, the supervisor says my name and asks to speak to me. I can't quite remember exactly how the conversation went, but here are the keypoints.\n\n-He claimed he \"knew\" I don't work for a security company (which I obviously did) -He asked why I was sweeping up the glass -I told him I've observed the officers drive over it every time I'm working that site, and wanted to do something nice -He claimed he had never seen me on that site before -I told him I had had face-to-face interactions with his officers numerous times over the last month -He spoke to my boss over the phone -He informed me I was picked up by the cameras on the intel building, and my actions were deemed suspicious -He told me my personal vehicle, being kitted out with a CB radio and LED driving lights, looked suspicious (but he flip-flopped on this point, weirdly) -He took photos of my personal vehicle -He, for whatever reason, brought up my past, including episodes of depression/self-harm/suicidal thoughts, my medication, my interest in emergency services, my unsuccessful application with that very same intel agency (I hadn't told a soul that I even applied for it), and a couple other things. (note: I had never met this guy before, and he already knew all of this before even stepping out of his car) -Finally, he said he'd be writing a report of this incident on the police database (I can only assume it says \"Security guard working site swept up glass; deemed national security threat\")\n\nSooo... they finally let me go. I did my routine walk around the site, went back to my car, and while I was texting my friend what happened, my boss showed up. Saw me with my head down for five seconds, and tells me to meet him at his office immediately after my shift. I was fired that day.\n\nTL;DR: Swept up glass. Government intelligence agency &amp; Federal Police consider me a threat to national security. Got fired.",

        "text": "Hey all, boy do i got a doozy for you. I been siting on this for a few months but figured it was about time to whip it out. This is one of many tales of the joys i get to deal with as a front Desk Concierge of a mid to high end condo. \n\n(For a bit of context here the parking situation is as follows. About 35 spots for 2-22 floor towers. Parking is free but requires a parking permit obtained from Security after 11 pm until 8 am the following day. Each resident gets 7 a month. an infraction nets you a warning , and then a repeat offense gets you a ticket issued by the city. Got it? good.)\n\nThe players in our tale..\n\nMr. and Mrs. Douchenozzle - The antagonists\n\nThe Writer - Me - The sad and weary protagonist\n\nS/O New Guard - As the title implies he's the new guy. Young and a bit absent minded, but he tries.\n\nS/S Bossman - The Best Supervisor i have ever had or will have. The man takes no shit and sees and cuts right thru the bull.\n\n\n(Before we start i just want to apologize for the format here. My Company requires us to Write in the third person and it was too much work to change it from that. i have however edited any identifying information).\n\n\nAt The above noted time and date. As The Writer was conducting desk duties. the Writer was confronted by the Resident of ****, Mr.Douchenozzle. Mr. Douchenozzle Wanted to know why he had received a Warning ticket on his visitor's vehicle in visitor parking. The Writer informed Mr. Douchenozzle That All visitors must have a visitor permit on their vehicle for overnight parking. \n\nMr.Douchenozzle at this point stated that he believed that a visitor permit was only required after 2am, Mr. Douchenozzle stated that this was printed in his condo rules that he received upon moving in.\n\n\nThe Writer at this point informed Mr. Douchenozzle that it is recommended to obtain a visitor permit before 11pm for overnight visitors. Mr. Douchenozzle at this point started to become very hostile and stated that \"How was he supposed to know that\" and \" Can you just take this back?\". the Writer informed Mr. Douchenozzle that he could not take it back, But that it was only a warning to be more careful in the future.\n\n\nMr.Douchenozzle at this point demanded to know \"Why wasn't my guest informed of this earlier, when he came by the desk?\". the Writer stated to Mr. Douchenozzle that he was unsure as to why that would be, as The Writer was not on duty at the time Mr. Douchenozzle's guest arrived. Mr. Douchenozzle then stated \" Well you should know, you work for the same company!\" . The Writer at this point informed Mr. Douchenozzle that there are multiple signs in the P1 area informing guest and residents of the fact that a visitor permit must be obtained from Concierge to park in visitor parking. Mr. Douchenozzle at this point stated \"I have lived here 2 years and this has never been the case\"\n\n\nMr. Douchenozzle at this point began walking away from the desk and stated \"Fucking ridiculous\" before leaving the area.\n\n\nAt 2:25, Mr. Douchenozzle again approached the front desk to request to see a copy of the Condo Rules. The Writer provided Mr. Douchenozzle with the rule Sheet the Writer had at the Desk. Mr. Douchenozzle Stated \"This is an older version\" , \"We Moved in on 2016 and our rule book does not state this\". Mr. Douchenozzle at this time began taking photos of the rule sheet. As he was doing this , Mr. Douchenozzle repeated multiple times, \" This is ridiculous, Nothing says to get a permit before 11pm\". The Writer again informed Mr. Douchenozzle that their are many signs downstairs that state the fact of needing a visitor permit to park in visitor parking. \" Mr. Douchenozzle at this point stated. \" I have lived here 2 years and i have never seen these signs your speaking about, when did they go up?!?\" The Writer informed Mr. Douchenozzle that they had been up as long as the Writer had been working at this location, for at least the past year. Mr. Douchenozzle at this point stated. \" well they don't matter, what i have in my head from when i moved in matters\".\n\n\nThe Writer again informed Mr. Douchenozzle That the signs are in place to remind people to register with concierge. Mr. Douchenozzle responded with \" you know what? Screw your signs. They don't matter\". As well as \"You keep mentioning these signs, but i have lived here 2 years and this is the first i am hearing about them.\" Mr. Douchenozzle at this point stated that he would be taking this issue up with Property Manager Jim. The Writer agreed with the statement that Mr.Douchenozzle should bring this issue up with the property manager. At this time, Mrs.Douchenozzle arrived downstairs and joined her husband in questioning the Writer.\n\n\nMrs. Douchenozzle stated that she had been here 2 years, and that their rule book stated after 2 am. The Writer stated to Mrs Douchenozzle that he was aware of this, as her husband had shown the Writer pictures of his copy of the Condo rules with the fact stated in it. The Writer again stated, this time to Mrs. Douchenozzle , that their are multiple signs downstairs that state that you require a visitor permit. Mrs. Douchenozzle stated, \" We have lived here 2 years and this has never been the case\". The Writer at this point advised the couple that it would be best if they brought up this issue with property manager Jim.\n\n\nMrs. Douchenozzle at this point stated \" you work for *Awesome Company* do you not?, you represent the company?\" the Writer stated the he did. Mrs. Douchenozzle then stated\" Then how can your other guard not say anything to my guest when he's here?\" the Writer stated that he could not speak for the other guard. Mrs. Douchenozzle then asked \" Then why did he tell my guest that they could park there without a permit?\" The Writer stated that the previous Guard, S/O New Guard, was most likely under the impression that their guest was not staying the entire night. Mrs. Douchenozzle at this point stated \" well this is just ridiculous, how can you represent *Awesome Company* and not even know what your other guard is doing?\"\n\n\nThe Writer at this point again recommended they take this issue to Property manager Jim. Mr. and Mrs Douchenozzle both stated that that is exactly what they would be doing, as well as speaking to S/S Bossman. Mr. Douchenozzle at this point stated 'You need to get this straightened out with your supervisor, because i WILL be speaking to him on Monday\". the Writer agreed with Mr. Douchenozzle. Mrs. Douchenozzle at this point stated, \" and you should do something about your attitude, you have been extremely unhelpful and un co-operative. You represent *Awesome company* and you should have a working relationship with the building, I have lived here 2 years and i want to know when this change was made, Any changes like this Jim normally informs me by email\". At this point Mr and Mrs Douchenozzle left the Front Desk Area. This report was written for your information.\n\n\n\n\n\n(At the end of all this, The following Day, The Douchenozzles did not, in fact. Talk to my supervisor or property manager. But rather, Called my head office to complain. Luckily for me. I have been a model employee for this company for the past year with nothing but stellar reviews from property managers who's sites i've filled in at, Supervisors i've worked for and the mobile's who do patrols. Nothing came of their anger other than a good laugh from upper management. And The fact that both of the Douchenozzles are now too scared or ashamed to walk through the front lobby past the Front Desk.)",

        "text": "This story happened about 2 years ago in the winter at our old football stadium what my orders on the dead site in the middle of the hood was every hour do a patrol to make my job easier I set up wireless cameras to link to my computer so I didn't have to actually go out in the cold as the company I worked for refused to provide me a winter coat. So while watching the cameras one went out on me right after it looked like something crawled under the fence. So out into the cold I go. So I'm doing a basic foot patrol while saying \"security, if there's anyone out here identify yourself.\" That way noone can say they were scared and reacted when I snuck up on them. Well about half way through the patrol I find my camera unplugged as they were only temp cameras well I plug it back in and see that there's another set of footprints in the fresh snow so I follow them to one set of stands. I get to the enterence of the stands and shout into the poorly lit area \"security, is anyone in here?\" No reply, so I start to carefully go in. About half way through I find this about 35year old man wearing nothing but a t-shirt and shorts with a set of runners keep in mind that the weather was like -45°c with a foot of snow falling every hour, this guy was so cold his fingers were damn near black so I get the guy to come to he apologized for trespassing and said he just had to get somewhere warm and that he will leave my exact words were \"shut the fuck up and come with me, I'll get you somewhere warm and safe.\" We quickly move to the guard shack where it was nicely heated. I called the police not for him trespassing but mainly for paramedics. Well ems and police arrive within minutes to my site and talk to the man who said that him and his wife got into a bad argument and she kicked him out with nothing. The cops asked me what was his condition when I found him. I told the police that if I didn't find him he could be dead. The police ended up going to the guys address and arrested the wife for attempted murder and the medics took the guy to the hospital. I heard that the wife got a few years in jail and the husband changed the locks and is filing for divorce.\n\nMy orders for the site are to arrest any trespassers on the site, to do a patrol every hour (give me a damn coat and I will).\n\nI was the only one that ever did patrols, 2 per shift 1 every 3 hours, and I wasn't arresting someone clinging to life. Protect people's lives before worrying about a building",

My elation for FINALY finding the event is reworded with a full HD video of a drunk guy walking out of the restraunt and staggering around the parking lot on the side of the building for a couple of min. He then does the patented \"drunk guy forward walk but go in a circle\" and ends up at the back door of the restraunt where he then proceeded to go to the back door (its behind a chest height wall) and stand there for a moment with his back to the camera. He suddenly turns around and starts undoing his fly and whips out his johnson and begins to piss all over the walkway to the back door. Here is a 60+ year old fat man pissing in public with his face perfectly shown and his johnson swinging in the wind.\n\nI tell you, its not what i wanted to see...ever.\n\nFunny thing is, he didnt even notice the nice new camera pointing at him and his water show.\n",

With that been said, these clients have some ridiculous expectations.\nHaven been a guard for so many years I naturally try to set them up for success. The clients will complain about any and everything to swindle out of paying the contracted rate. \"Your guard was on the phone, Sitting, drinking water, etc\"   \nGranted there is a fine line between someone being careless and someone taking a few minutes to tend to there human needs. They always mention it at the end of the event or when they need to pay the invoice lol. \n\nMy point being, this drives some of the weaker managers into becoming a$$holes because they try to meet the clients unrealistic expectations. The best way to defeat this is to ask the client to list there requirements before hand. So long as the list objectives have been met then so should the invoice objective.\n\n",

We remind of the no weapons policy in the hospital, he gets his pass, we inform our supervisor of his threats and get the usual, \"that's just part of your job\" even though we think he was actually serious and shouldn't be allowed back in.\n\nFast forward to the end of our shift, and sure enough, this guy is waiting in the parking lot with his knife. Good news is me and my coworker know what we're doing so it doesn't go as bad as it could. We write our incident reports and call the police but the guy is long gone.\n\nWe tell our supervisor that we need to look out for this guy and make sure he doesn't come back, and you know what he says? He says, \"Well you're not hurt, and we can't prove it happened besides your word since we don't have cameras in that parking lot.\"\n\nIs this typical in anyone else's experience? Or is it just me?

        "text": "It's pretty clear by now that I enjoy my themes. So today I'll share three of my favorite stories from people who are simply too tired to function. Remember, kids, always drink your coffee before you try to do any work.\n__________________________________________________\nCleaning Keyboards\n\nLibrary security is fun because you have all kinds of nonsense on the computers. Generally you're just there to tell people not to spill drinks on the keyboard, though I was a little late to stop this young lass. Chickadee was roughly 19, clearly cramming for a college exam, constantly waking herself up whenever her head dropped onto the desk. \n\nShe noticed the keyboard was really grimy and in her tired state thought, \"Oh, I should clean this a little. Let me just dump my bottle of water on it to clean it up.\" About a second of this later, she jumps back with her bottle of water, realizing what she was doing. I'm already over there when I noticed what she was doing, thought about getting on her case, but decided to be nice about it without risking our equipment. No more computer for her, go home and get some sleep.\n_________________________________________________\nBruce Lee, Is That You?!\n\nSome of our patrons only care about watching videos and movies on the computers, something I hardly agree with losing valuable PC space for, but is allowed. Cue very young lad with very little sleep. I found from the parents that they were from out of state and had been driving for ages on little rest, the kid was definitely feeling it and tried watching a kung fu movie to entertain himself.\n\nRoughly 20-30 minutes later I'm doing a patrol when I notice the lad snoring in front of his movie. Cheery as can be, I walk over without realizing the threat to my life. A simple, \"Excuse Me,\" and suddenly the child leaps from his chair, earbuds flying out and his hand chopping down on my leg with a loud \"Watchaaaw!\" Clearly, the sheer magnitude of this kid's power threw me across the room and I did not have one of those few times where it's impossible to keep a straight face in security. A few seconds later and the kid is waking up, with everyone staring at him, and babbling about how he didn't know what he was doing. Angry parents came, I defended the kid, and asked him to teach me some of his moves. \n___________________________________________________\nSmoker's Habits\n\nTired smokers are usually the most irritable from my experience, but sometimes can be the funniest. For instance, one extremely tired smoker was up the entire night before they went into work, binge watching White Collar on Netflix most likely. Upon reaching their place of work, they decided to go outside and light up, get the urge out so they could walk around and wake up before starting the day. Reaching down into their pocket, they drew their lighter, put it in their mouth, then proceeded to strike the cigar so they could smoke their lighter. I think that they were in different pockets than usual so just the muscle memory came in.\n\nSadly, it took me breaking my cigar before I realized what I was doing. People saw. ",

        "text": "Recently I started a job as security.  This is my first time working security.\n\nI work valve watch at a construction site.  My roomie does fire watch.  It is a pretty uneventful job and we mostly get to play on our phones all day.  All we do is do an hourly patrol of the floor (indoors in a skyscraper) and radio it in as complete to the building engineers.\n\nOne day early in the morning the radios start going nuts.  We get to overhear a frantic exchange between the engineers.\n\n&gt;&gt; This is ENG1, we have a sprinkler alert in the parking garage.\n\n&gt;&gt; LeadENG copy that I'm on my way\n\nA few moments pass\n\n&gt;&gt; LeadENG WE have a busted pipe down here by the elevator.  Some truck hit it.  I need a shutdown of pumps 1 and 2 and close the valves.\n\n&gt;&gt; ENG1 copy that.  Pumps 1 and 2 are offline.  \n\n&gt;&gt; LeadENG The water is still flowing hard.  Did you close the valves?\n\n&gt;&gt; ENG1 i did not.\n\n&gt;&gt; LeadENG you need to close the valves or water will still flow.\n\n&gt;&gt;  ENG1 Copy that.  Heading back to close the valves.  \n\n&gt;&gt; ENG1 valves are closed\n\n&gt;&gt; LeadENG ENG2, can you work on a work order with sprinklerCO?  This needs fixed overnight.\n\n&gt;&gt; ENG2 will do.  We got guys from sprinklerCO in the building on the construction floors.\n\n&gt;&gt; LeadENG get him down here.  ENG1 AND EMG3 get some shop vacs down here.  We have  to contain and cleanup all this water.\n\n&gt;&gt; ENG1 and ENG3.  Copy that\n\nThis conversation lasted for around an hour or two.  What started this was a truck that was too high for the garage entered and drove down a few floors.  Hitting several things on the way down.  The first floor is a bit higher than the other floors so he was fine there.  But after hitting all the other stuff (including the destruction of 8k worth of newly installed insulation) he had no excuse.  The result was that the company has been banned from entering the building.\n\n\nSo far, aside from my coworker destroying two coffee pots in two consecutive days, this has been the most interesting thing to happen.  And it wasn't my problem to worry about.\n\nTl;Dr. Truck that is too high busts up a sprinkler pipe in the parking garage throwing the engineers into panic mode.",

I work closely with local law enforcement as well as contracted security. One of my responsibilities is to train all the staff including managers on different safety and security topics. Yesterday I trained a classroom full of managers on evacuations. I basically gave them a crash course on running a command center with the staff available at the time. Most of these managers look up to what we call the \"Manager on Duty\". The MOD is basically the manager above all managers on property, they basically call the shots. Anyhow after the training I bring up the topic of people freezing up in the time of an emergency. I told them everyone has a threshold and will think about their family and future and might not want to assist in the evacuation of an unsafe atmosphere. The look on their faces was unforgettable. It looked as if they realized being the MOD isn’t what they dreamed of after all. I can see them passing the MOD role around like a hot potato in an emergency lol. \nSomeone literally came to my office after and admitted they wouldn’t want to do it. lol.\n\nAll in all, I said it once and I’ll say it again. Talk about security officers all you want to but when push comes to shove, in an emergency you will see why you pay them when they are the only people who don’t panic and forget every procedure ever written. lol\n",

        "text": "Right, figured I'd share a few short and sweet ones. I'm a rather easy-going security guard for a library, nothing special. However, when I do get annoyed, my alter-ego \"Pettyguard\" activates.\n\n_________________________________________________\nPizza Toll\n\nNearly every single day in my library there is a specific man who comes in, sits in our lounge, and orders a pizza. This is entirely fine, but he also tries to eat it inside every single time. I've had to waste my time dealing with him every time, usually the same argument of, \"It's a public library so I'm allowed to do this here.\"\n\nTalking to him, kicking him out, etc has had no effect and I can't have someone barred just for being annoying. So instead, I started meeting every delivery driver at the door when they show up. The pizza goes in the office fridge. When he asks about it, I give it to him. Cold. He no longer eats his pizza inside.\n\n___________________________________________________\nRoblox Noob\n\nFor some ungodly reason our library allows kids to play Roblox on the computers. Not something I have an issue with, but I do get annoyed by this one kid who constantly gets angry when he's killed. Rather than throw him out, I've noted that he usually only gets loud after an hour. Conveniently, our computers need them to renew their time after an hour, which can't be done if there's a pending reservation on that PC! \n\nEvery time he's begun getting loud around that time for renewal, there's always a reservation waiting and he leaves 2 hours before any of his friends since he can't play.\n\n____________________________________________________\nThe Mystery Van\n\nWe have no idea how this began, but this van began showing up every day, parking in my employee space. Rather annoying, we only have a few. No one wants the van to be towed as that's a lot of frustration for us, especially since we have never figured out who the driver is. Instead, I found a nice new roll of stickers to play with!\n\nEvery day that driver comes to his van, he finds another sticker very well sealed on his windshield. Nothing dangerous if he decided to just drive with it, nothing that takes more than five minutes work to remove. After all, he didn't have a few minutes to read the note we left him asking him to stop, so now he has to spend several daily peeling that really annoying sticker off.\n\n__________________________________________________\nIf you'd like more, let me know. I've been in security about three years and quickly found that petty revenge is a faster way to stop a bad regular than any usual punishment, so I've got plenty from all sorts of places. ",

        "text": "Howdy lads and lasses. I'm one of the many stalkers of this subreddit, not much in my post history. I decided to post this story up to r/TalesFromTheSquadCar and figured it would make a nice addition here as well. I hope it delivers some much needed chuckles during your shift or whenever you read it! Sorry for any formatting issues.\n\nA bit of background, I'm a semi-experienced security officer with a rather large amount of diversity in my word for someone of 3 years security experience, everything from guarding mine shafts to basically being a receptionist and for the one important for this story, a chemical plant. Simple job, sit in a shack, control the gate, report everything, mind the ghostly apparitions that desire your soul. At least, that's the job description according to a guy I shall dub Crazy Steve (CS) for this.\n\nCS was the annoying coworker in every possible regard. That one guy you know who doesn't understand the internet but wants you to look up 70s songs for him to listen to off your phone constantly (Especially Manfred Mann's Earth Band), the one who sleeps or hides in a corner where he thinks you can't smell his urine/weed, and the one who uses every last bit of coffee and never contributes to the coffee fund. On top of all of this, he was absolutely certain the site was a haunting ground for ghosts, demons, and aliens. I have several stories surrounding the downright strange things I've seen him do, but this came after his termination from threatening to cast a death curse on our boss over the phone to a poor, innocent truck driver just trying to get through the gate.\n\nNeedless to say, things went south for CS very fast, and not even a week has passed since his unwilling departure before we all receive a notice to be on lookout due to sightings of him trespassing on property and attempting to urinate in the bleach the plant was producing.\n\nMy shift was about halfway over when CS decides to show up, banging away on the gate and shouting for me to let him in. Being the nice guy I am, I decide to make him aware I would call the police if he did not leave before actually doing so, for which the only response I received was, \"You have to let me in...please...they're here, whispering, they're all around me!\" After several minutes of insane rambling with no real content, just more of the same, I tell him I'll check around for spirits, which I do to ensure there's no animals around that are the source of his concern, in order to dial the police.\n\nCS and I wait around for barely five minutes before a single car pulls up, and I will never forget this for all of my days. A young fellow who seems very new and unsure about himself strolls up to ask what the problem is, after conversing with me over the phone about the issue as policy demands for that particular site. CS explains the situation in something that went sort of like this.\n\nCS: \"Officer, thank god you're here! I'm being called here, sought out, you have to help! I've worked here for years and I know them well, they're angry, furious, I'm not here to quell them and the young guard here is in serious danger! He won't last long if I don't help him!\"\n\nI'm standing nearby, snickering, with the cop shooting me strange glances.\n\nOfficer: \"Is there someone out here trying to hurt you? What kind of danger are you on about?\"\n\nCS: \"They're coming! They're coming because the charms are wearing off, I have to get inside, the spirits from beyond are coming to reclaim their grave site! We're on an Indian burial ground, sir, and I must get inside to protect us before their fury is unleashed!\"\n\nAt this point, the look of absolute shock is apparent on the officer's face, a look I can only describe as half shock and half suspicion that he's being filmed. After glancing at me for a reassuring nod that CS is, in fact, serious, the officer tries to take control of the situation.\n\nOfficer: \"Alright sir, calm down, it's alright, you're not allowed into the facility but I assure you everything will be fine. Why don't you come with me and we'll get you taken care of, and then I can come back and look for your...spirits.\"\n\nCS immediately realized what was going on, and the gears in his head were visibly turning as he thought this over for a few seconds. Rather than leave or calm down, he decided the best way to handle the situation was to double down. He began to claw at the gate, gurgling and pulling on it while rolling his eyes back in his head. As I'd never seen him or anyone act this way, I was a little taken aback, but the officer stayed calm as CS slurred out in his best impression of a ghost, \"They've come, they're here, a possession by a Spirit From Beyond! I must get in, I must, before this evil creature takes me, for your sake and his you must let me in!\"\n\nThe act was rather bad, but just stunning in how desperately he tried to play it. The cop was very obviously trying to stifle a laugh, I decided to light up a cigar to busy myself with as the performance was both hard not to laugh at and just very embarrassing. After a moment, CS just stopped, looked between us, and his shoulders and head fell.\n\nCS: \"I'm sorry, guys, I just didn't want to embarrass myself after all that, I'm not really possessed, I'm sorry if I fooled you...I just wanted to help.\"\n\nAt this point, I was forced to make an excuse of needing to go on patrol so I could lose it out of earshot. When I got back, the officer was waiting at my shack with CS handcuffed in the back of his cruiser. Apparently, after I left, CS took the chance to try and dart past the officer to a tear in the fence none of us knew about, got stuck halfway in, and was arrested. Probably occurring while I was checking the shipping dock inside one of the buildings, as I hadn't heard it. I gave my statement to the officer, mostly things like, \"Yes, he has always believed in things like this. No, this isn't anything completely new, although the possession was.\"\n\nRight then, the officer broke character for just a moment, leaned over, and said, \"Between you and me, for half a second, I really believed he was an escapee from an insane asylum.\" A few chuckles from me, a couple more questions answered, and a very bewildered officer drove off and I was left with a very large amount of paperwork and a difficult job of figuring out how to put it all down describing the situation within company guidelines.\n\nAftermath: I've met the cop once more after this, shortly after I left my job at the chemical plant. CS was to have a psyche evaluation and his security license voided, as well as some fines and a few days of watch in a hospital. Apparently, the story had his entire department giggling for days. This was a couple months after the event, but they were still warning him to beware spirits from beyond for nearly every call. He got some free food out of it though for such a good story, so it was fine with him.\n\nQuick Note: Aside from smoking weed, CS apparently had a very active lifestyle of drug abuse in the past, but was entirely clean around the time of this event. He was just flat out crazy, rather than high as I assumed. Never found out what happened after everything was said and done, but every now and then I put on Manfred Mann's cover of Spirit in the Night and try to put myself in his shoes, just for fun to try and see the world how he did. I am heavily convinced I can never achieve this without acid.\n\nOh and no, the chemical plant was not on an Indian burial site nor was there one anywhere near the town where this occurred. He was very thoroughly convinced otherwise, however. I'd only heard about it seventeen times during our shared hours.",

Actually, it had been robbed three times in the space of six months.

A few days in, I've gotten accustomed to the building. I know most of the employees and have gotten a feel for what a normal day at the bank is like. \n\nOne day, around lunchtime, I hear something very disconcerting. An African-American male, mid twenties, maybe, in a white tank top and track shorts walks by me, talking on his phone. I hear him, clear as day, say, \"I ain't doin' this shit. There wasn't supposed to be no fucking security guard here.\"\n\nThat put me on edge, to say the least. I informed the branch manager, and he forwarded the info to the proper authorities, but nothing has come of it. Never saw the guy again.\n",

Once he was done, something caught my eye, a bottle of booze. I realized he was hammered, he wasn't able to walk in a straight line whatsoever. \n\n   At the time it was 36 degrees and raining moderately. After watching the man stumble around for a bit, he passed out on the sidewalk. The homeless man was getting drenched, and the cold would kill him. At the time I felt like calling the non-emergency hotline was the best option. \n\n   I then called the non-emergency hotline, and gave the dispatcher all the information I had. After roughly 15 minutes the homeless man woke up, and tried to get upright. After a couple attempts he gave up and laid down. Eventually two EMTs came by in a van, and talked him into going with them. After the whole situation, I'm happy how it ended, no one got hurt or died.  \n",

The staging lot we have to patrol the inside of it, and the actual site we just patrol the outside. The key factor of this site is that there's a homeless shelter across the street, so we have homeless milling about. \n\n While I was doing an exterior patrol of the staging lot I started talking to someone who lives in the shelter. Well, he told me \"Just a heads up there's a guy walking around with an axe\". At that moment my oh shit meter skyrocketed. I had the guy point axeman out and give a description. The next thing I did was call dispatch for some guidance. Dispatch told me to call 911, and report back to him after. \n\n So I start to call 911, and see the guy with the axe walk up to a group of homeless, and start arguing over something. When I connect to the 911 operator I gave some general info (Name,Location, etc). The operator said they couldn't do anything unless he threatened someone. In reality, the police don't like the area. \n\n So after I was done talking to the operator, I just kept an eye on axeman. I figured out he was fairly drunk and just starting arguments.  Eventually the guy wondered off somewhere.\n\nI'm just surprised that the police didn't do anything. The guy was drunk, and starting arguments with a deadly weapon in his hand. \n\n \n",

        "text": "I initially posted this in the JNMIL sub (JustNoMiL subreddit, a subreddit for those of us who need to commismerate over objectionable maternal figures in our lives.) and several folks over there asked that I cross-post here. \n\nIn the meantime, I work security for a couple different companies (mostly high profile, high traffic stuff), which you think would be ripe with JNMIL behaviour, but oddly enough, I haven't seen a lot. \n\nBut I was retelling stories about this particular lady to my new roommates and realized she fit the bill perfectly! Onwards, dear llamas (an affectionate term for the denizens of /r/justnomil )\n\nFor about nine months, I was the security supervisor for a newly constructed condo/retail development. Now, some background, for those of us who have never had the opportunity to live in one of these death traps of concentrated humanity, there's some things that wouldn't occur to us house and basement suite dwellers, particularly when it comes to move ins and move outs. Now, as mentioned, this was a newly constructed building. The developer was a year behind schedule and eager to make money as fast as possible, so suites were getting signed over at a rate of about 12 per day. Of course, people wanted to move in that quickly too.\n\nIn order to move in efficiently, apartment dwellers are required to book an elevator in advance. This involves a nifty trick where the elevator is set to independent mode and nobody else can use it, because it'll only respond to button pushes made from the cab. In smaller buildings, the manager is generally in charge of scheduling and dealing with the elevator, but for this development, that job was ours. We only had two working elevators in a 57 story building and one poorly designed loading bay. (THANKS DEVELOPER /s) I quickly instituted a signup calendar of five move-ins per day that was nearly booked up solid for three months straight.\n\nWith that background in mind, I received a phone call one morning that raised my eyebrows.\n\nMe: Hello [condo] Security, how can I help you?\"\n\nJNMILW: \"So, I would like to move in on [date] at 11am. You'll book that for me?\"\n\nMe: [looks at calendar] Well I'm sorry ma'am, but that time is already booked. You're lucky though, I happen to have a cancellation for the 8am slot. You can have that one.\"\n\nJN: No no no, book me for the 11am. That's when I'm coming.\n\nMe: No, that's not possible ma'am. Another family already booked that slot. You can have the 0800 slot or book another day. The next availability is [date] at [time] or [time].\n\nJN: No no, we'll be coming on [date] at 11. Just book it in for me, we'll make it work.\n\nMe: No ma'am. The loading bay won't fit two trucks and we can't take two separate elevators out of commission. The building is too tall for people to take the stairs from the upper floors.\n\nJN: If you could just book us in for 11.\n\nMe: No. You can pick the 0800 or [alternate date]. That's my final answer.\n\nJN: Well, we'll see about that. * hangs up*\n\nMe: Uh huh.\n\nNext day, same thing. I've condensed it a bit. There was a lot more of her repeating \"no no, I need [date]. Just book me in for that, and we'll make it work\"\n\nMe: Hello, [Condo] security, how can I help you?\"\n\nJN: Hello, I was hoping you could book me in for [date] at 11am.\n\nMe: No ma'am, I only have the previously stated availabilities, which I should note won't stick around for long.\n\nJN: No no, I need [date] at 11am. You can just book me in for that.\n\nMe: No ma'am. That's not going to work. 0800 or a different date.\n\n[repeats x8]\n\nMe: Ma'am, you are not going to change my answer, no matter how much you repeat yourself. I will book you in for 0800. Please be on time.\"\n\nNext day, I get a call from a male voice.\n\n\"Hello, I'd like to book a move in for [same date] at 11am\".\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, but we're already totally booked for that date. You can choose between [date] and [date] if you'd like.\n\nMan: There's no availability on that date?! Me: Nope, the last slot was booked yesterday.\n\nMan: Which time was booked? Who booked it?\n\nMe: Sir, I cannot release information about other residents without their written consent.\n\nMan: [deep sigh] Did you give it to my mom? [name?]\n\nMe: ..... as a matter of fact, I did.\n\nMan: But you didn't give her the 11am slot.\n\nMe: Nope. another family booked it weeks ago. There's not enough room for two moving vans. I explained that to [JNMILW], uh, rather extensively. She has the 0800 slot.\n\nSon: [angry snort] Right. Sorry. I'll talk to her.\n\nMe: Alright sir. Have a good day.\n\nThe next day I get a panicked call from one of my guards at 8pm, saying there's a lady on the phone freaking out at him and demanding she be scheduled for 11am on date.\n\nMe: Is it [JNMILW's name] on the phone?\n\nGuard: I don't know! She's got a [strong regional accent] though!\n\nMe: Yep, that's her. Tell her she's got the 0800 slot. I'm not changing it and if she doesn't like it, she can come talk to me.\n\nNext day, son calls. I realize he is the kind man I have chatted with on a few prior occasions, when he's come in to do inspections on their apartments.\n\nSon: Are you sure there's no openings on that date?\n\nMe: Absolutely. You guys would be blocking entry and exit into the parkade if you showed up, plus you'd be sitting there waiting for the other family to finish with the elevator.\n\nSon: [sounds embarrassed] See, my mom doesn't believe that. She thinks you're discriminating against her because we're [ethnicity].\n\nMe: .... Does she not hear me doing announcements in [that country's language] all the time?\n\nSon: I KNOW I KNOW I TOLD HER. She won't stop yelling at me to get the date though.\n\nMe: Sorry dude, but it's not going to happen. Strata rules, I enforce them.\n\nSon: [sigh]\n\nNext day, JNMILW calls again. Rinse repeat daily for two weeks, as the insults start to build. I get permission from the strata (who love my hard line attitude) to repeat. \"No ma'am. No ma'am. No ma'am\" in a bored monotone voice whenever she calls. My guards are instructed to not talk to her and refer her to me whenever she calls.\n\nThese are interspersed with increasingly desperate calls from her son to make \"just one exception, for him\". I can hear her screaming at him in the background of a few of them, and his increasingly haggard appearance and apologies in person has clued me in that this is definitely not his idea. He's firmly enmeshed though. Poor dude. My temptation to take pity on him is stalled by the fact that I'm pretty sure that's what JNMILW is counting on.\n\nD-Day arrives. JNMILW's sister and son arrive at 0745am. They make veiled comments about \"her not listening\" and avoid my eye before heading up to their apartment.\n\n0800 rolls around. No sign of JNMILW. Colour me unsurprised.\n\nI call the 11am booking to check on them. They roll in on time, politely sign in and start unloading.\n\nAt 1130, I get a call from the 11am booking.\n\n\"There's a crazy lady down here, screaming at our movers. Can you come down?\"\n\nMe: ah, there we are.\n\nI head down to the loading dock, which is at the parkade entrance. The patriarch of the 11am booking is standing with his movers, staring down at a teeny lady who is loosing her shit at them. Their truck is safely ensconced in the loading bay, out of the way of traffic. There's a second giant moving truck sitting on the ramp, blocking all access in and out of the parkade. The movers from that van don't appear to want to come out of their truck. I don't blame them.\n\nMe: What's the problem here?\n\nJNMILW: I BOOKED THIS TIME! I BOOKED IT! I NEED TO UNLOAD MY MOVING TRUCK!\" 11 am booking patriarch is clearly too confused by the vitriol to respond. Looks at me helplessly.\n\nMe [recognizing her voice instantly]. \"[name], as I stated in our numerous phone conversations, you were booked for the 0800 slot. It is now 1135 am. Even if you HAD been booked for the 1100 slot, I would have given it away to someone else, given how late you are. Get your moving van out of here before I have it towed out!\"\n\nJN: [lighting fast switch to attitude]: Oh, but can't you just make one exception? I'm here now. I can just move in with these guys. gestures to 11am group, who are gawking like the finest of llamas\n\nMe: (At this point, I'm totally done with her shit) No. You had your chance and lost it. You were booked for 0800. I am not giving you special treatment for not following the rules.\n\nJN: YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT! I'll get you fired! (note the lightning fast tack switching!)\n\nMe: You can't get me fired when I'm following the rules EXPLICITLY LAID OUT by the strata. You going to tell them to fire me for following their rules?\n\nJN: Well, You can't talk to me like that!\n\nMe: I can talk to you however I want. You won't change my mind. Strata will back me up on this. You can book for another date.\n\n(I should note that the Strata at this point has been increasingly amused and horrified by my updated emails on this lady and the other more nasty residents - almost none of them have held a strata post before. Thankfully most of them have very solid BS metres, and were reasonably sane. I understand this is not the case usually.)\n\nJN: I am here now. Let me move in.\n\nMe: No. Move your truck or I'll call the cops.\n\nJN: [switching tack again] Please, I'll just be a few minutes.\n\nMe: No. Out. You were supposed to be here at 0800.\n\nJN(in a tone that clearly tells me she expects sympathy for the following): WHO GETS UP AT 8AM ANYWAYS?!\n\nMe: ..... [eye twitch]\n\nMe: [hisses] I got up at FIVE. GET OUT.\n\nLater in the day, son stops by my desk with a gift card and thanks me for being the only person that his mom hasn't been able to bully.\n\nHe later bought me lunch when I towed her car from a no-parking zone.\n\nAnd a bath set when I yelled at her for scratching the walls in one of the hallways and billed her for the damages, despite her pleas to \"let it slide this one time.\"\n\nAfter that, 0800 AM Lady tried to avoid me entirely. Which didn't work, because my guards refused to talk to her, and always told her to talk to me. It was beautiful, because I could tell she had so much trouble trying to stay civil. I RELISHED it.",

The south side has a construction entrance, and also the northside. There's a parking garage gate on the north side that leads to the first floor/lobby. \n\nOn with the story, it happened around 230 am. I was doing a foot patrol going around the exterior of the building. As a rounded the corner to face the north side, I saw a homeless man duck into the north construction entrance alcove.  Since the man was on the property, and couldn't be there I pulled out my flash light and pointed it at the alcove. I was to far away to see into it, but I could hear the faint sound of water hitting the wall. As I approached the alcove the guy popped out and was trying to talk, but couldn't because he had a cigarette in his mouth. \n\nI approached the man and said \"Hey man, what's up? What were you doing in the alcove?\"  The guy said \"I was taking a piss, couldn't find any other secluded place\" I then said \"Well, sorry to say, but you can't do that because it's private property\" out of the blue the guy said \"You scared me a bit, and I ended up pissing all over myself\" and then he just walked off. \n\nHomeless people can be pretty entertaining sometimes.

I'm just mortified at the screen, but I'm also laughing becuase... what the fuck, right? \n\nPatrol gets there and the housekeeper *pauses the video*. He doesn't turn his screen off or set his phone down. He just pauses it. I couldn't hear the exchange but I knew exactly when Patrol told the house keeper we have cameras because his jaw dropped down through the crust of the earth to China.

Some people fail to understand what could happen &amp; how important having protection truly is. I have been in this industry long enough to have seen some ugly situations saved by Security. I also have seen the looks and heard comments that security is a easy job, or they don't do anything etc etc. Usually from the same people who are screaming \"SECURITY\" in any hostile situation.\nToday I had to hire two off duty police officers from our local police department. The officers are in full uniform including duty belts and fire arms. In other words, they are willing to risk their lives to protect you should some mad man decide to make a statement by shooting up the facility. Anyway, the client asked to speak to me to tell me that she saw the officers talking on their phones by the elevator. For one, I checked the cameras and they were talking to a colleague of hers, for two I have these guys scheduled for 6 hours straight so if they want to spend a few minutes in a dim lit area to check on their wife and kids so be it. Not to mention our means of communication with them is by phone. I refused to have the officers communicate on the same radios as the event servers, bartenders, parking staff etc.\nMy point is this, I constantly hear about the downtime of security and police officers while on duty. Just know that, that downtime makes up for itself if and when they have to respond to a emergency situation. You may find yourself depending on that officer who was on the phone to save your life.\n\n*Side note, I trained to be an EMT when I wanted to become a fire fighter a while back. While doing my ride along I was amazed by the downtime. We literally sat back chilled and bought snacks for most of the shift. The other part of the shift was responding to some of the most intense health situations I've seen.  \n\nStop hating the downtime, while expecting them to save your life if push comes to shove.\n",

This is probably not much of a tale to be honest, just a brief weird encounter barely worthy of note in a DAR.\n\nMy main gig for the majority of my employment has been at a large hospital campus in my regions capital city. That site is extensive to put it mildly, offering one of the largest and most active ED's in the region. amongst too many other services to list off.\n\nThe site has a staff of 10+ people per shift most of whom are amazing! some are goofs and a small handful can only be described as dangerous liabilities.. Your typical security team I guess you could say?\n\nAfter six years of fun and chaos downtown, along with some issues in my personal life, I decided to try out a new spot, so now my current full time tasking is at a small country hospital. \n\nStaff here all seem to be awesome so far! both in the security department and in the other services. I have only met one liability and he is not even on full time, all the full time guards are switched on. \n\nEach shift has one supervisor with maybe one to two officers depending on the time of day, a small ED, couple inpatient units, a single psych unit and lots of outpatient services. It is a very quiet site, largely consisting of some very fundamental access control and rounds with the occasional bit of active work (patient watches, standbys, hands on, etc.) \n\nIt is very quiet. (You see where i am going with this right?)\n\nFast forward to tonight's night shift, I am sitting in ED, waiting room is down to 2 patients, and a gentleman walks in with an odd look to him. \n\nCaucasian, blue jacket, beige slacks, shaggy hair and what I can only describe as dead eyes.. if that makes sense? I give him the patent pending \"evening sir\" and single downward nod.\n\nzero response. He is just staring blankly at the triage booths. not moving, not blinking, not reacting to anything around him. I'm not going to think much of this.. and assume its just my head messing with me. I'll go back to writing my log and eying the cameras. \n\nLook back up, he has not moved or even breathed from what I can tell, look away.. look up again. Now my boy turns around and leaves, climbing into a blue hyundai that I couldn't nab the plate on.\n\nMaybe I'm still on edge from what feels like a lifetime of city work, along with a couple of \"close calls\" along the way.. but this shit was creepy as all bloody hell and I did not like it one bit. \n\nYou know I could probably make more flipping burgers or doing call center work if I would just swallow my pride.

Pineapple shirt is very drunk and got in an argument with the bartender because he claims the bartender won’t return his ID and credit card. We’re a cash only bar so the bartender would never have taken his credit card, and we have door guys checking IDs so the bartenders don’t ask for them. \nWe get pineapple shirt across the street, explain that he’s no longer welcome in the bar, and explain that while we’re certain we don’t have his ID or credit card he’s welcome to come back when we open tomorrow to check our lost and found. We get pushed, pineapple shirt tries to punch us, we eventually park him across the street and walk back to the bar. Get to the door, turn around, and he’s ten feet behind us and still walking. We go through the process again... and again... and again. \nFinally I begin the spiel: “I am an agent of the property owner. You’ve been asked to leave the property and are refusing to. You are now trespassing. If you do not leave now I will get the police involved. Do you want me to get the police involved here?”\n“Yes”\n“You understand that you’re trespassing and you want me to get the police involved?”\n“Yes”\nMy other guard and I look at each other, twist pineapple shirt’s arms behind his back and start walking him across the street. Halfway across the street he realizes what’s happening and starts begging to be let go.\nWe get to the police station and knock on the window where four cops who’ve been sitting around waiting for something to do jump up to join us, grins spreading across their faces. \n“Is he intoxicated? Has he tried to get physical with you? Great!” \nPineapple shirt gets handcuffed and the cops pull his wallet. ID and credit card are both there. Pineapple shirt spent the night in the drunk tank. ",

I posted this story a few days ago on tales from the front desk because I work security at a hotel, but someone commented that I should share here as well...\n\nSo I do security at a large property in Cali and this happened a few days ago..\n\nWe were having a fairly large group in house as usual (it was a seed convention!??) and we received a complaint from one of the clients that his new Apple airpods ($170) had been stolen right off his table in the convention center. Say it ain't so!\n\nWe played back the footage and saw a 17 year old male casually walking around the booths with his head on a swivel. The original client is seen leaving the table for 30 seconds and in that time the wee lad does a double take, snatches the airpods, shoves em in his pocket, and calmly walks away (he was actually very slick).\n\nOver the next few hours we were able to locate the kid and it turns out his father is on the head committee for this group RUH RO. As quietly as possible, we take him and his son away from the group and explain the situation and what we can clearly see on the footage.\n\nOf course the dad flips and accuses us of accusing his son of stealing. Uh duh yea. He says it's not possible and that his son thought it was a sample. Riiight. Surprisingly, the son just blurts out that yes, he stole them and we tell the father we need them back immediately.\n\nFather and son have a side huddle on the side and then proceed to tell us that the airpods are in their room (which is not at our property but one down the street...5 min walk each way). Dad begrudgingly says he will go get them. 20 min pass...40...60...this guy finally comes back after almost two hours with a shit eating grin plastered to his shiny, goofy head.\n\nHe tells us the airpods are \"on our property\" now but not on his person. He said that was close enough. At this point this whole ordeal has taken up almost my whole day and I'm over it. I tell this man child that he has 10 min to give me the item or PD will be here faster than you can say my son thought it was a sample.\n3 minutes later I have the damn over priced headphones, and 10 minutes later they are back in the very relieved owners hands.\n\nNot that weird/crazy I know but I thought it was so odd that this father would defend his sons klepto behavior in such an immature and asinine way.",

        "text": "For privacy and legal reasons I cannot post specific details of the medical calls but I can give an overview of my day. Im patrol in a high end community. We have patrol cars equipped with green/amber lights and sirens and are authorized to respond within our community on private roads as “emergency vehicles”  I.e. speed, run stop signs etc.  While I’m a licensed EMT working in as a “first responder” which limits my skill set to what a normal person can do.  Normal procedure is arrive and care and assess until EMS/FD arrives. They have a pretty good response time and for the most part appreciate what we do.\n\nFirst call comes in for a fall. Myself, and 3 other units respond. I evaluate and treat the patient and fire rescue responds. Patient denies transport and goes in his own vehicle. While this is going on a second call comes in. Luckily the fire department is on scene for the first call and I am released from the scene with 1 other unit. (There’s a web of legality about leaving a scene if your the highest level responder). Chef has cut his finger. Bandage and send him out to urgent care for stitches. \n\n2 hours later another fall. Myself and 2 units arrive and start evaluation. Either there is some brain injury or a lot of alcohol was involved. (I’m inclined to believe the latter). Patient has no idea that she fell and where she is. Patient transported by EMS. \n\n1 your before shift change the last medical call comes in for trouble breathing. I don’t carry oxygen so I know I’m limited in what I can do. Myself and 2 units arrive. Patient says she’s having trouble breathing but seems to be ok to me. Fire and EMS arrive. Patient denies transport. I think patient is a hypochondriac. But I can understand she’s elderly and lives alone, and sensation of not being able to breathe is scary. \n\nAll in all not anything major or super exciting but it was weird to get slammed by so many medical calls.  Luckily I got a great team of co-workers to help. ",

        "text": "In a truck yard of a fairly decently-sized distribution center, as one would imagine, a lot can happen. I've seen collisions. I've seen tears. I've seen broken bones. And by jove I've seen stupidity in spades. But on one particular occasion, I had the sadistic pleasure of witnessing stupidity so colossal, such considerable audacity, such immeasurably prodigious lunacy, that I feel compelled to shout it at strangers on the internet. Gather 'round the fireplace, dear children. It is time for the tale of Sir WankTears.\n\nThis distribution center, for reasons I am not paid enough to think about, loads trailers during the day, and then uses the same dock doors at night to receive product to ship out. My presence, a good 99% of the time, is out of need to communicate. I'm the phone guy. I'm Mr. Telephone. And I've been drained of all emotion.\n\nOne fateful night, a truck driver arrives for an appointment. He is, as all truck drivers who deliver here are, going to have the contents of his trailer unloaded. After this is accomplished he will leave. The only issue with this statement is that this truck driver, Sir WankTears himself, is a few hours early. And this company runs strictly by appointment. So he's just gonna have to go to an offsite staging area and chill for a bit. Standard procedure.\n\nMy colleague working the gate with me informs Sir WankTears that he will have to go and wait until we call him. Sir WankTears does not like this.\n\n\"I only have 12 pallets! You give me door now!\" Sir WankTears cries. Sir WankTears is not a proficient speaker of English. Sir WankTears is not a proficient speaker of any language.\n\n\"No,\" my colleague responds. \"You have to go wait.\" He's done this song and dance before. The charm has worn off.\n\n\"No. I'm not leaving until you give me door!\" Sir WankTears is very, *very* persistent.\n\n\"If you want to argue with me,\" my colleague states simply, \"you can leave and not come back.\" Sir WankTears does not understand that we can make this happen. Sir WankTears does not understand a great many things.\n\nIt is at this point that Sir WankTears starts his enormously enormous truck and drives off into the yard. This is not unexpected, usually drivers have to drive down the yard a bit to turn around and leave through the gate (the other option is a 45 degree lawn with a fence), but I inform Yard Security of Sir WankTears's existence regardless.\n\nYard Security exists for many reasons. One of them is, in the event of a problem driver attempting to park in the yard (not allowed), go inside the building unauthorized (not allowed), using the company's dumpster to dispose of their own waste (not allowed), or generally being a pest, Yard Security will send said problem driver on their merry way. Simple.\n\nI watch Sir WankTears's truck mosey on down to the other end of the yard, at which point Yard Security Approaches the Vehicle. He does this with such poise and professionalism people generally listen to him. And as I hear the radio moments later- *\"Gate security, call the authorities\"* -I can tell that concepts like poise and professionalism are lost on Sir WankTears.\n\nI look at my phone and begin dialing the number for police dispatch (I have it memorized) when I see Sir WankTears's truck heading back up to the gate. I hit CANCEL. I'm going to have some fun with Sir WankTears.\n\nSir WankTears's truck stops at the gate, and proceeds to look at me in a manner I can only describe as the manner in which a fish looks at a person through the glass of an aquarium. This goes on for several minutes, before I open the door and Approach the Vehicle. I do this with an air of such disdain and apathy that people generally underestimate me.\n\nSir WankTears rolls down his window and continues to look at me without doing anything. He is speaking into his headset, yes, but he is not doing anything about my presence while *also unabashedly acknowledging my presence.* This is not normal human behavior. This is not rational human behavior. This, my friend, is Sir WankTears behavior.\n\n\"What's happening?\" I do not ask this in the way an excited dudebro would ask an arriving friend. I ask this in the way an overly-harassed desk clerk would ask if her computer monitor was constantly set to display a picture of Nick Cage midway through eating a burrito.\n\n\"I'm on the phone with the police!\" Sir WankTears declares. He declares this with such an air of triumph that I can only assume he thinks being the first to call the police means you've won whatever argument you were in.\n\nI have this habit of pinching the bridge of my nose when I'm faced with rampant idiocy. I fight the urge. Here this sorry excuse for a man is, speaking with the police, with no legal ground for needing them. By all rights, **I** should be the one summoning the police.\n\n\"And why,\" I can't help but ask, \"are you on the phone with the police?\"\n\n\"Because you're being rude and mean!\" Sir WankTears shouts. He has become properly angry. \"I need a dock door, I'm not leaving until I have door, and you are being mean! I only have 12 pallets and I'm not leaving!\"\n\nThe bridge of the nose is pinched.\n\n\"So...\" My brain has officially jumped ship. It has thrown itself into the murky abyss to tread water. Better than being on this crumbling, burning, sinking wreckage of a conversation. \"You're likely going to be prosecuted for trespassing, and *YOU'RE* calling the police?\" Sir WankTears's eyes widen. *Ah,* I've said a word he understands. He leaves the premises. And all is well.\n\nUntil 10 minutes later, when a confused looking cop pulls up to the gate. He's just as baffled as I am. Needless to say, Sir WankTears did not have a good night after that.",

I gently placed an arm on either side of her and pivoted her away from him and began the trip to the stairs whilst trying to keep her alert and awake.\n\nShe saw this as someone taking her home and grabbed for my crotch instead. I quickly moved her hand away and continued walking (now with a little bit more haste) down the stairs, when she saw that I was not a customer but in fact a door supervisor or “bouncer” she started to scream “RAPE RAPE HE IS TRYING TO RAPE ME” at the top of her lungs. \n\nThis caught the attention of a few passersby on the stairs who looked on with a mix of intrigue and growing outrage. \n\nI quickly threw my hands up as to say ‘look my hands are here’ (which in hindsight may have made me look guilty), this meant that the only support this lady had was gone and she then started to scream “IM GONNA FALL, IM GONNA FALL” and desperately started trying to grab a hold of me to prevent her falling, all while I was being chastised by other male and female customers for not looking after her properly.\n\nLuckily a female member of the door team had started to make her way upstairs after she heard my call and offered to take over the situation.\n\nI guess this was the first time that I truly realised that in the line of work people will see you as a bad guy until THEY decide it’s time for you to be a good guy.

        "text": "Hello fellow security peeps. Allow me to tell you about how I had to school this ignorant drunk at the bar I was bouncing at.\n\nA little backstory. I have been working in security related jobs for about 3 years now. I have worked a night shift at a medium sized mall as well as an afternoon shift at a particularly dangerous mall. The second mall tended to have a lot of pan handlers and squatters as there were a lot of condemned buildings around that housed both the homeless and the drug addicts.\n\nIn this job I have removed more than my fair share of people due to the absurdly high amount of trespass notices we issued on a daily basis. It got tiring after a while and I decided to bounce until I could find another place to work at.\n\nSo its late, and all the patrons are starting to filter out for the night. I was working door so I got to be the lucky guy who stood out in the cold listening to all these barely coherent drunks trying to figure out how they would get home. Somewhere along the line a particular patron was bitching about how he was issued a trespass notice and how it wouldnt stop him from going back into that establishment.\n\nI calmly explained to him that if security felt it was necessary to do that, he must have done something wrong in the first place. Buddy goes on about how he has \"freedom of access\" and that it was against the law to kick him out and keep him out of the mall. Trying not to have an aneurysm, I explained that a mall although open to the public, was still privately owned property and the security guards are there to insure that the property maintains the level of operation and safety that the client of said property has laid out for security.\n\nHe mumbled on about how it was mean and cold to kick out homeless people trying to stay warm and I agree'd. But ultimately it was their temporary comfort, or my job. I am not heartless but i will pick my job everytime.\n\nIve been rambling now, but it irks me to no end that people believe that malls are this sort of extra house that they can do whatever the heck they want in it. The amount of times Ive had to tell people to leave because they thought they could walk in regardless of what they were told as if it was a right to access these malls was alarmingly high.\n\nITS PRIVATE PROPERTY.\n/EndRant",

        "text": "Esteemed colleagues in the noble field of physical security I would like to take a moment to rant and rave.  Normally I try and put on a bit of a comedic flair to my stories for entertainment and because that's how I deal with stress but over the last  two days Ive had my personal pet peeve thrown in my face and I just have to speechify about it.\n\nDrugs.  Fucking hate them.  Have zero sympathy for those who abuse them and their lives run to pot and take pleasure that borders on the erotic when a dope slinger gets shot up by his peers.  I grew up in a drug family seent it rip everyone I cared about lives apart and it damn near got me.  I joined the army and went to war to escape that shit that's how much I hate the dope.\n\nNow I don't care about a little pot, frankly marijuana is a joke in terms of life destructiveness compared to the hard stuff.  anyway I have two short stories to tell.  They will be vague so as to not violate HIPPA but I'm fairly certain I can word it in a way that will protect the patients' identities.  If any of you other hospital security types think that Ive given out to much patient info please let me know so I can take this down post haste.\n\nSo last night I was already keyed up from a run in with the hospitals ghost.  (that's a story for another day) Im wandering around the hospital telling myself I'm not going soft in the head when that most wonderous of calls comes over the radio.  \"All available officers report to behavioral.\"  Here we go again.\n\nSo I beat feet over to Behavioral and luckily most of the other guys are already there so I don my nitrile gloves then put my slash resistant gloves on over them because fuck communicable disease.  We speak to the tech and he gives us the low down.  A female patient in the throes of amphetamine overdose.  She looks fairly attractive and was probably a beauty before she began snorting the Adderall or whatever it was.\n\nWe move her over to a stretcher and hold her down while the techs and nurses strap her down in restraints and she is just screaming and crying the entire time.  They are trying to get an IV into her and we are having to struggle with this tiny woman as she fights and bites at them screaming for mommy.\n\nThey finally get the damn port into her and then they bring out a catheter kit.  They cut her pants and. . . .overly used panties  and prepare to cath her.  Im holding one of the legs and due to prior experience I take a quick glance over at her ole monkey to make sure she hasn't started pissing.  They do that sometimes when the nurses try to put a cath in, I wasn't being a pervert.  After I'm reasonably sure she isn't going to cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war I avert my eyes.  She might be a dope fiend but she is still someone's daughter and if God forbid some female I care about is in this position I would like to think that she would be afforded some decency.\n\nThey get some medication in her and she drops down and actually starts snoring.  They throw a modesty sheet on her and we are dismissed to go write reports.  As I'm walking out I hear the nurses talking about how her brain is probably fried and she wont ever be right again.  Fucking meth man.\n\nMy second story happened less than an hour ago.  I come in and get my equipment and prepare to take desk duty when the dispatch officer asks me to poke my head into . . . you guessed it behavioral because a young man is pacing around agitated.  I go in and talk to the same techs and nurses from last night and they tell me this guy has meth and cocaine in his system.\n\nSo I call for some back up and do my double glove routine.  The tech is talking to the dude at the door and at first he is talking kinda hard.  This guy's mama is in there with him begging him to calm down, crying asking him why he wants to do this to himself.  I start removing things from my pockets thinking this is going to be a dust up but after another five officers pile in he calms down real fast, gets scared even.  He complies with the tech and allows the nurse to give him some night night shots and lays in his bed curled up and muttering to himself.\n\nTurns out this guy had recently been raped in jail and the sight of so many large men piling in there freaked him out.  I felt a rare swell of pity for the little dopehead.  Let me tell ya'll the sound a man makes when he is being anally penetrated is one that follows you around for a while.  Seeing it follows you too.  All of that misery because he wanted to get high.  Fucking drugs.\n\nWell that was cathartic.  I normally don't like to post things quite this dark but it was really pissing me off and you can't really talk about these things to much due to HIPPA.  Once again if anything I have written could be considered a HIPPA violation please let me know immediately so I can take it down.  Yall stay safe out there and for God's sake stay away from that shit.",

        "text": "Hey everybody it's story time.  Sit back and be regaled by the wonderous tale of stupidity and woe that can only come from being posted at a fraternity during a frat party.\n\nThis was way back in 2011.  At this time I was working full time for the local county sheriff's office as a detention officer which is just a fancy term for jailer.  The new sheriff had decided to change our titles to something that sounded better because God knows we all need a better sounding title than a better pay check I'll tell ya hwat.  -_-  \n\nAnyway we didn't get paid shit at the jail so through my admirable friend and collaborator who worked with me at the jail I managed to pick up a side gig as a security guard for the crappiest security company ever to grace this fine nation.  My partner from the jail who I will refer to now as Willie and I made it a point to work together when we worked for the security company on our off days.  We would work clubs and campus foot ball games and the drunk bus and of course the got damn fraternity.  \n\nNow this could be a fun job because there was no shortage of fine young women who frequented these establishments and would endeavor to consume vast amounts of the good stuff in order to YOLO or whatever stupid shit people are screaming these days, and at this time I was young single and amorous which is just a fancy way of saying horny enough to drag my ass across the floor like a dog with worms.  Now don't misunderstand I never took advantage of a drunken young lady, any liaison I had was with a coherent willing woman and I turned away plenty of falling down drunk women though it hurt me down to my thumping gizzard.\n\nThe pay was shit but I got to chill with my buddy and hit on college girls while on the clock and more than once Willie would cover for me while I took one to the parking lot and commenced to making angels cry.  Ah to be young again.  Anyway since we were part timers and could say yay or nay to jobs with near impunity there were certain places we simply would not work and some where we preferred.\n\nThis particular frat house was on the preferred list because these kids for the most part had some damn sense about them.  Willie and I had a good working relationship with the cats who ran the frat house and we were often requested to work.  I liked them because they enforced their house charter with vigorous enthusiasm.  \n\nI liked their style.  They preferred to keep things in house and they policed their own.  By way of example they caught one of their \"brothers\" roofying a chick and had us stand over him while he packed his stuff and was thrown out that night.  Now my memory is fuzzy and I've taken quite a few blows to the head over the years but it seems like they may or may not have slipped Willie and I some extra under the table cash to. . . .persuade this jackass that he was in the wrong.  I'll let you decide what that means for yourselves.\n\nAfter the rousing bout of pugilistic calisthenics we tossed said offender who I will from this point refer to as the dumbass, out onto the street and I couldn't resist putting a good size chaw of dip in and say \"get the hell out of dodge.\"  Willie looked at me side eyed and shook his head.  The poor guy had been forced to deal with my smart mouth and aggressiveness at our real job far to often.  In those days I was fresh from a tour in Iraq and was angry and looking for a fight and usually found one.  Different times.\n\nAnyway we got dumbass gone and the frat guys patted us on the back slipped us each a beer and the poor chick who almost became a victim drunkenly squeezed both of our hands and slurred a heartfelt thank you that still warms my belly to this day to think about.  It aint often you get to actually do some good in this business but when you do it makes the job that much better.  So Willie and me settle back into our routine of checking IDs and talking shit when we hear a scratching noise and a thump from the corner of the large wooden fence that surrounded the frat house.  I go over to investigate while Willie stays at the door and lo and behold if it aint dumbass trying to scale the fence and get back in the party.\n\nI holler for Willie to come back over and we explain to dumbass that it would behoove him to leave now.  He just looks at us like we are beneath him and once again tries to get over the fence.  \"Boy if you don't sit your ass down somewhere Im going to rip your spine out of your ass and beat you to death with it then take your mother out to a nice dinner and never call her again!\" (huge fan of anchorman if yall cant tell).\n\n The ridiculousness of my threat made him lose balance and he fell flat on his ass.  Willie and I then each grabbed an arm and literally tossed him into the road.  To make a long story less long he spent the rest of the night trying to get back into the party and was continually tossed around.  Finally at around three AM he gave up the ghost mainly due to being so beaten and bruised that he just didn't have the strength to do anything but sit on the curb and cry into his hands.  Bout that time Campus police showed up and took him off our hands.  They gave us dirty looks at his beaten state but didn't say anything, they knew us from the jail and knew that we probably had a good reason to use such force, assuming it was us who did it wink wink.  \n\nAnd so endeth the tale of the dumbass would be rapist who got his head stomped in and ironically would see Willie and I at the jail the next night.  He was less than amused.  One last thing.  I was a very different person in those furious days and I have long since out grown the need for such brutality.  Anyway yall stay safe out there.\n\n",

        "text": "TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nI work security at a hospital on a coastal city.  I'm a third shift guy and I enjoy it a lot compared to some jobs ive had in the past.  It is for the most part a quiet job of checking doors, escorting people to their cars (it's a bad neighborhood and most of the staff is female) and just doing nightly checks and sign ins and yadda yadda yadda.  We do have our oh shit moments though.  It may sound strange but for me it is the right amount of oh shit moments to break up the monotony of the patrol and checks but not so many that I go home completely drained every morning.  Well one night I'm just moseying around the towers because it's two in the morning and I'm just roaming waitng for a call to come in for some kind of assist, sipping on coffee and watching bits and pieces of late night shows on the waiting room tvs as I pass through when I get the call that most \"wonderful\" of calls.  \"All available officers report to the ER, I say again all available officers report to the ER.\"  I hop on the radio and identify myself and tell them to log me enroute as I begin briskly walking towards an elevator that will take me where I need to go.  The dispatch officer acknowledges and then gives me a short brief on what Im walking into.  Basically just a person acting strangely in the waiting room staring at nurses and just acting a little on the crazy side all around.  So I get down there and the lady at the triage desk points him out to me.  He is a small black man looks to be in his early to mid twenties and he is just standing there staring at us.  The triage nurse tells me that he has been discharged and is waiting for his ride.  I radio in that I have arrived and that I am going to hang around until the dude's ride gets here or I have to boot him.  So I go over to the waiting area and try to spark up a conversation with him and the dude's cornbread obviously isn't done in the middle if you catch my meaning.  I invite him to walk over and watch the game with me and he starts to walk over to the tv but then he sees a pretty young nurse walk by and goes back to staring at her and then starts to rub his crotch.  sonofabitch.  I go over and with a calm voice but furious eyes explain to him that he needs to go sit down and wait for his ride.  He then throws a shirt he had draped over his shoulder on the ground and looks at me.  I then say pick that up and go sit down or I am going to have to escort you off of the property.  He stares at me.  I raise my voice slightly and put in a command tone (or at least what I think is a command tone lol) and say pick up your shirt and sit down or your leaving.  He steps back at that then quietly says ok I'll go.  I then radio in what's going on and walk him outside.  Dispatch officer tells me he is sending some additional officers as well.  I walk him outside by myself because I can see the hamster in his head turning and I want to get him away from all the nurses and techs and whatnot.  As we are walking outside he looks at me sheepishly and asks  \"so. . . . .are you THE god?\"  I was not expecting that.   No.  No sir I am not THE God or any other god.  I'm just incredibly good looking.   (Now that we are away from cameras and bleeding heart nurses I can be a bit more loose in what I say)  He nods and continues walking.  I walk him over to where the property ends on a sidewalk and tell him to either keep walking down the sidewalk or sit in the bus stop until the city transit comes by.  He sits in the bus station and lowers his head.  I start to head back and take about ten steps when I see three of my colleagues come towards me.  We will call them One Two and Three.  One points behind me and says that the crazy dude is going into the visitor parking lot so then one and I take off running after him.  Two and Three keep walking slowly.  Understand that Two is old.  I mean old as in he got his security license while fleeing Egypt with Moses and is simply in no shape to run.  He functions more as a FTO than anything else.  Three is a coward.  A simple irredeemable coward who will hide behind a female nurse half his size when things get rough and I wouldn't trust him to guard a warm cup of piss.  Anyway One and I catch up with crazy dude who has started using his extra shirt to polish a fairly expensive looking vehicle.  One and I halt him and flank him on either side and walk him further off the property.  Eventually he gets far enough out to where the officer in the exterior patrol vehicle takes over haunting the little psycho and keeps an eye on him until he has left the premises for good.  It was an interesting night to say the least.  As a reward the nursing staff had a fresh cup of coffee and a donut waiting for me which made the fat kid in me rejoice.  Not a bad night all in all.\n\n\n\nTL;DR:  Crazy guy harasses nursing staff I escort him off property and he mistakes me for a god.",

This was my 4th day on my first security job. \n\nI was controlling an access point, making sure that absolutely no one (except for LEOs &amp; EMTs) enter through an exit. This was a major sporting event in my city, so it drew tens of thousands of people. The entrances are crowded, both with people leaving and those trying to sneak in. It was me and 2 other guards, and we were turning people away (sometimes physically).\n\nBut there was these 2 guys who wanted to come in. Unlike some of the other people desperate to see the event that I had to deal with, they didn't push, beg, or cry. Instead, one of the guys discretely asked me a question, that for once, prompted me to consider disobeying orders from my supervisor: \n\n*How much money will make you change your mind about letting us in?* \n\nI paused for a minute, caught off guard by the question I had just been asked. My eventual response was telling them that I couldn't answer their question. \n\nSo they began walking passed me, the first guy slipping me a 20 in my hand. I say nothing. \n\nThat is, until I see one of my coworkers, who happens to be standing just several feet away, looking right at me, having seen the transaction in progress. I immediately tell both of the guys they couldn't come through there, and hand them back the $20 bill.\n\nMy coworker, still watching, just grinned and shook her head. \n\nFuck. \n",

I answer and she said that christmas gifts were stolen out of her car. I got her name and number and asked when did it happen? She replies six hours ago on the morning shift and would like a copy of surveillence footage and contact phone numbers for my boss and the property management.  I tell her i have to contact my manager, that i cant give out the managers number and that contact with PM is email only, and that she has to FILE A POLICE REPORT.  She goes \"I do?\".  I affirmed that and she left.           \n\nFive days later,(mind you I was already late due to four accidents on the freeways) she comes back screaming and cursing and saying she was going get me fired because I didnt file the police report.  I told her calmly that A: She was the victim, she had to file as I told her before and B:I havent heard anything from my manager and  That didnt go so well. She screamed and cursed for 10 mins more then left.  Finally got a hold of the manager and what do you know, they dont release video to anyone but the cops.  Cops later told me, yes i was right, she had to file the police report.  I havent heard anything else and since Im still working there (unfortunately), I guess the lady finally figured it out or the manager got the brunt of crazy woman.  ",

I had my first encounter of many with him within the first 2 weeks of him being there.\n\nWe have a sensors allong areas of the fence that go off if somone were to jump the fence. There is also a sensor that goes across the back gate that gets activated when the back gate closes for the night. \n\nThe first time i met our new resident was when the gatehouse notified me of an alarm activation at the back gate and in the cameras he can see someone walking thier dog by the gate and looking in the gatehouse there. So i head down there and see that its an elderly man walking his dog. I greet him and explain to him in a very friendly manner that he is setting off my alarm. I explained to him that if he goes past the line on the ground it will trigger the alarm.\n\nHe thanked me for telling him and he then told me he had just bought a place here and that he used to work for the government doing some sort of special ninja security gobbly-gook bla bla bla. I was finaly called away (thank you gods of security officers!) by the gatehouse to deal with a noise complaint.\n\nThe next day about the same time the gatehouse calls me to let me know the alarm is going off at the back gate and that the same guy from yesterday is back there. So i get there and greet him and again explain he is setting off the alarm.\n\n\"yea i understand buy i wanted to check the gate myself. I feel better knowing its been checked\" he tells me\n\n\"sir,\" i said \"thats what i do here. Its my job to do that, not yours. Every time you set off the alarm you take it off line for the entire community and pull me away from my job to come here just to see that its you looking around. I need to ask you to stop, your actualy interfiering with my job when you do this.\"\n\n\"oh, i didnt realise that.\"\n\nso i thought it would be over after that.\n\nnope.\n\nHe likes to set off the alarm just before he is done walking his dog so i have to go check the alarm. \n\nHes set off the alarm 3 times (so far) JUST to talk to me and ask me to check on a strange vehicle or people he dont know. When i told him he cant use the alarm system as a way to call security he needs to CALL us on the phone...he told me \"oh, i didnt bring my cell phone\"\n\nHes told management that HE caught a kid on a bike trying to climb the fence to get in and confronted him and HE also caught someone pushing a golf cart to the wall and using it to climb over the fence.\n\nManagement is well aware of him and i found out the other day he is not well liked in his building because he tries to be the \"code enforcment officer\" of the building.\n\nIm one of them \"document everything\" kind of people. and every time i deal with this nut job i make sure its documented. as i said, management and the board are well aware of this guy and cringe when he is at the meetings.\n\nHis thing now is that hes all upset that we guards are not armed. He wants us all armed...but not willing to pay us more.\n\nthank god he is the only person wanting this. everyone else says no to us being armed.",

We have a sensor on the gate that lets the gatehouse know it opened and there are cameras back there so they can see what is going on.\n\none night the gatehouse called me on th eradio and tells me the alarl went off for the gate and a \"mini ambulance\" came in.\n\nIm thinking to me self what the heck is a mini ambulance as i respond that i am close to the gate and will check it out.\n\nI get to the the 2nd parking lot in and what do i see but a black wrecker with its ally lights on spotlighting cars in the parking lot. its a repo truck. \n\nThere is no way that he came in to the front gate so i instantly told the gatehouse to call the police department i have a repo company tresspassing. I then was able to get him to stop and i gave the gatehouse the license plate number and description of the vehicle and guy.\n\nI confronted him and asked him how did you get on property and he replied \"oh the gate was open\".

        "text": "Ill start this off by stating that i work a 55 and older gated community as a patrol officer.\n\nWe are NOT:\n\n1. Roadkill Removal - 1st time - The gatehouse recieved a call from a resident stating that they hit a oppossum and \"you guys\" need to clean it up. The officer at the gate told me i had to clean it up when i came in for my night shift. I kindly informed them that i am not the roadkill removal officer and that sort of thing is a maintanince problem not security. 2nd time - someone called the gatehouse and said a rabbit was floating in the pond dead and we needed to get it out. Same officer told me to go do it. I told them i am not roadkill removal... and its in the pond, it will be gator food by morning.\n\n2. Laundry Service - Resident called the gatehouse requesting they send the patrol officer (me) to her units laundry room and get her laundry out of the drier and put the items in the washer in the dryer for her and being the dry stuff to her unit. The officer that was working the gatehouse then used to do the patrol and informed her that laundry service is not what we are here for.\n\n3. Harassment Tools - Long story short is i have several residents who cant play nice and they like to call security on one another for \"talking too loud\" or \"they walked by my unit and they walked too heavy\". 5 times in one night i got called to the same building. I finaly told them that i will no longer play a part in your harassment games and this all will be going on my report with names and unit numbers for the board to read. \n\n4. Taxi Service - I drive a modified golf cart for my patrol vehicle. We are not to let anyone but an employee of the community, alarm company, or our security company in the vehicle per insurance. One of the gatehouse officers keeps putting me in a bad position by telling guests that i will bring thier guest to them or gall me to the gatehouse and then in front of the resident tell me to take the person home. I have no problems telling him (over and over again) and the residents that we can not have anyone in the cart per the insurance. Ive told the guard several times to stop telling people i will do it.\n",

My sister works at a fairly small grocery store.\n\n\n- - -\n\n\nThe grocery store is where this incident occurs. I'm wandering around the store, as usual, looking out for anything against the rules. My sister, meanwhile, is at a till.  '.'  As I wander past the till, I see she is having a bit of trouble with a customer. Just stubborn 'derp I can use this gift card derp' stuff, when he can't. He's fairly big (muscular big not fat big) but not quite as tall as I am, meanwhile my fairly small sister is dwarfed by both of us. He doesn't see me wandering around, though this is fairly normal.  Then the ball drops. She must have said '\"no\"' one time too many for this a\\*sh\\*le. He starts *yelling*.  \n\n&gt;I WILL FIND YOU!  \n\n&gt;I WILL FIND YOU AND RAPE YOU AND KILL YOU!  \n\n&gt;YOUR WHOLE FAMILY IS DEAD!  \n\nI am now, erm, **MAD.**  Right after he yells this, he storms out with his groceries in hand (he had paid already).\n- - -\nAfter this, she is understandably shaken up. The manager tells her she can take the rest of the night off paid (this is 2 hours before her shift ends). I ask him if I can walk her home (we live together) he says yes, though I will lose some pay.  As I exit the building through the employee exit, I see my sister trapped against the side of the building by this asshole. It looks like he's trying to force her into his car, which is running at the curb right behind him.  I kick him. Can you guess where?  I then get him into a full  nelson and \"accidentally\" let my sister punch him in the face.  Now, the police station is quite nearby, I choose to wrestle him there myself.\n\nWill update with what happens next, I am writing this right after being questioned.\n- - -\nEDIT: Here's an update:\n\nHe didn't bother getting a lawyer, he says he can represent himself (what? how the f\\*ck do you think that's a good idea?). He wants to press charges on me for assault.\n\n- - -\n\nSide note: My sister is also a brown belt in Shotokan karate, and, as some of you in the comments (and I) seem disappointed, the punch she got him with HURT.\n\nAlso, for those who wanted him to get more, I'm very lucky I had a brain left. I _would_ have killed him.\n\nAlso, this is Canada. I don't have a gun or a taser, nor do I want either.\n- - -\nEDIT 2: FINAL UPDATE:\nHe's away for good. He was wanted for around 12 other crimes including robbery, assault, sexual assault, some pedophilia related charges. It's finally over.\n",

The dog started growling and barking so I put him inside and came around to see why. Saw a large white van across my driveway as I came around the house. Then I saw a man standing at my car, just closing the door of it. I asked him who he was while going straight over to him and what was he doing in my car. He started explaining that he was delivering a parcel to the house and pointed at the car. There was a large white package in the front window but that really didn't do much to stop me from going from angry straight to furious fairly instantly.\n\nI started by asking why was it being left in my car and why did he think opening it was a good idea. I had looked at the van and didn't see any markings on it to say what it was. This is not a good sign because we have people in Ireland who do go around in vans looking for houses like mine on the edge of communities and going inside the property to steal from it. I repeated my question but louder(was already loud) and he showed me his tablet, he wasn't wearing a uniform with markings either, to prove he was telling the truth. He was delivering a parcel for (my brother) and when he came in he saw the door facing towards the road and thought, correctly, that it wasn't the front door and that some country houses have the front door at the back, also correct.\n\nThis still did not make what he did any better as far as I was concerned and I made that point. He replied, in an apologetic way, that he had heard a dog barking and having been bit loads of times delivering packages to houses like mine who keep a dog he didn't want to chance it. He had left the package in the car for safety and was going to ring the listed number.\n\nI calmed down a lot. Everything he said made sense and all the information he had regarding names and reasons matched up. He continued to explain and apoligise but I cut him off and apoligised right back. I over reacted. I could have sorted this faster and easier if I had approached in a better manner like I do and have done for the last thirteen years working retail security. It was just seeing someone in MY driveway at MY open car door had my anger go from 0-60 fairly instantly. If it had been in work I would have been much calmer, starting to make me think I need to look into getting a new job. One where I'm not being put into stressful situations with aggressive people. I'm getting into a single approach for dealing with people out of work that's not good for me. Outside of the need to maintain professionalism I'm noticing I'm being more aggressive to situations or people that don't necessarily require it.\n\nAnyone else finding that to happen?",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not security but I shared this experience with the local Social Security Office security guard yesterday.\n\nI had some business to take care of at the Social Security Office yesterday so headed there before work.  I walked into a room filled to near capacity with people waiting to be assisted.  I punch in my information into the computer ticketing system which spits out my ticket number 150 and take a seat in the first available chair which happens to be the closest to the door and the security guard.\n\nI'm wondering how long I'll be waiting since there are probably 30-50 people in the lobby waiting to be helped.  Scanning the room I notice a display board with a general display with weather and information as well as a list of the tickets currently being served scrolling across the bottom.  I glance down at my ticket and am slightly relieved as the tickets are broken down into different groupings by letter and 146 is currently being serviced and I'm only 4 away at 150.  Sweet!  Perhaps this won't take eternity like I thought it was going to.  Everyone seems to be keeping to themselves.  I haven't heard a peep from anyone waiting in the 10-15m I've been in the room so far.\n\nThen in walks the antagonist of this story...  A late 20s to mid 30s looking slightly chubby white woman strolls in through the front door and immediately begins talking to nobody in particular.  She takes a seat against the wall next to a nice little old country lady and begins recounting her entire life story.\n\nShe's there to get a SS Card for her son because she just moved from California and she wants to sign her kid up for Toys for Tots and apparently they require the card for registration.  She begins telling the older lady about the different paper work she has with her and how she's already been there a few times trying to get this taken care of.  She's very up-beat and loud.  The older security guard, who reminds me somewhat of Morgan Freeman, hears her discussing what paperwork she needs and walks over to ask if she needs help.  She begins telling him about each and every piece of paper that she has with her.  He calmly shows her the sheet of paper he has which he keeps with color coded sections to show what documents are required depending on if you need a card for yourself or for someone else and if the card is for an adult or a minor and explains what sort of documents are acceptable.  \n\nAs the guard is patiently explaining which documents would be acceptable she continuously interrupts him, repeatedly mentioning the particular documents she has with her and how surely they would be fine.  He repeats himself several times trying to emphasize what she would actually need but this information appears to fall on deaf ears.  This lady is too busy talking to listen and absorb any of the information he is providing.  He says that it would probably be best if she had some sort of medical record with her name as well as her son's name on it.  She jumps up rambling about some paperwork in the car and heads outside.\n\nThe guard and the little old lady start chatting and she starts teasing him about the loud lady and apologizing for him having to deal with her when she's obviously not paying attention to any of the words coming from his mouth.  He says that some people come in like that and think they know everything.  The little old lady teases saying, \"Well, she *IS* from California, don't you know.  She obviously does know everything!\"  They snicker a bit as the woman walks back in with another stack of papers.  The older lady says something about Cali again and the woman chimes in with, \"Hey! I'm from California!\" to which the older lady says, \"I know, dear...\"  The loud woman looks genuinely confused and says, \"How did you know I was from California!?!\" to which the older lady responded, \"You told me when you first walked in dear.\"  The loud lady thinks this is hillarious and begins cackling.  The security guard breaks a slight grin and asks if she has any other questions about the paperwork.\n\nAfter explaining what would be required for about 20 minutes he finishes up with her and heads to the back of the room out of my view.  The loud lady is getting louder by the moment and my nerves are nearly shot from having to listen to her endless chatter.  I pull my cap down over my eyes and start rubbing my forehead to try to relieve some of the tension headache that I'm starting to get.  The loud lady continues talking to the little old lady and to no one in particular, blurting out anything and everything that came across her mind.  She thinks of another question about her paperwork and looks for the guard with no success as she didn't notice him walk out.\n\nThe security guard came back about 5-10 minutes later with his lunch.  The lady has since moved on from thinking about whatever question she thought of and has since began reading every number that comes across the screen for the tickets currently being serviced.  She has one number below me since she had apparently been in earlier and got a number, left, then came back.  Awesome.  I have a feeling that assisting this woman will probably take a while with how scatter brained she seems.  Maybe I won't be out as soon as I thought.  \n\nThe lady begins making all sorts of strange noises trying to make a \"drum roll\" sound as she repeatedly says things like, \"DRUM ROOOLLL PLEASE!\" \"GIVE ME AN R!\"  \"COME ON R!\"  \"WE NEED AN R!\"  \"LET'S GOOOOOO!\"  She repeats numerous times that she's going to be super pissed off if she's not able to get this taken care of today because she has to leave and pick up her son at 1:30PM and she doesn't want to have to come back up to the office with her son in tow.  The loudspeaker dings, \"Now serving 147.\"  Loud lady cheers and begins to sing the Jeffersons theme song at the top of her lungs. \"MOOOOVIN ON UP! MOVIN ON UP! TOOOOO THE EAST SIDE!  Oh man, I don't even know where that came from!  Why did I just think about that song?  That's sooooo funny!\"  \n\nWe continue with her repeating different variations of the things she's already said for another 20 minutes or so until there's another ding of the loudspeaker with, \"Now serving 149.\"  Loud lady exclaims, \"OH! That's me!  Finally!\"  I agree lady.  Finally you're going away.  She walks to the back down the hallway and there's a collective sigh from the entire room.  It's quiet for about 30 seconds then an older voice from somewhere behind me says, \"Was that lady on meth?\" and the entire waiting room erupted with laughter.  I'm just glad I don't have to listen to her anymore.  Well, for about 30 seconds I didn't have to listen to her.  She was loud enough that even though she was down the hallway you could still hear most of what she was saying to the person assisting her.\n\nShe's in the back for about two minutes before she comes storming back out swearing at the top of her lungs about how terrible the office was, how terrible the people were, how it's total bulls**t that she can't get her son's card, and various other reasons that she's upset on her way out the door.  The security guard glances up as the door closes behind her, sort of shrugs, then glances over at me and says, \"I don't know why she's so upset.  I told her what she needed to get the card.\"  I chuckled and told him that I loved she was trying to justify her documentation to him since he has nothing to do with processing any of the information and had no way to assist other than to tell her what she needed.  He replies, \"Eh, what are ya gonna do?  Some people just can't be helped.\"  The loudspeaker dings, \"Now serving 150.\"  Finally.  I go back, get my issue taken care of in under five minutes and head back to the lobby.  Tell the security guard that I hope his day stays quiet and walk out the door.\n\nPoor guy.  I do not envy his job.  I can only imagine some of the people he has to deal with on a daily basis.\n\nTL;DR: Loud meth head lady comes into Social Security Office to get card for son, doesn't listen to what she needs, gets angry and cusses everyone out after being denied.",
