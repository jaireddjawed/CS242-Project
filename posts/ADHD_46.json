In all actuality, I feel like I do this with more than just relationships (I.e., jobs) where I get super excited about things when they’re new and shiny, but the moment the novelty wears off, I’m completely bored and irritated with whatever initially had my interest. Does anyone else do this?",

        "text": "I had the unfortunate news this week that my heart has “noticeable build up” of plaque in it. I’m 33. They wanted to know about my eating habits and whatnot and I got to explain to the doctor that while i make sure I eat my vegetables and fruits and keep low sodium as much as possible, my intense obsession with foods sometimes negates that entirely. \n\nI forget I eat it hyperfocus through my lunch and then eat a big dinner at the end of the day to desperately try and sustain myself. I know I’m not the only one who will focus on a food so hard that you can’t eat anything but it. Recently for me? That was Dino Chicken Nuggets. Can’t get enough of them. Did I still eat my veggies? Of course! But here I am, 33 years old and having to meeting with a cardiologist because my heart wants to kill me. \n\nThey said in the mean time I need to be cutting drastically anything that’s not heart healthy. This includes my favorite coffee drink! I can’t cut caffeine all together…no ADHD meds for me and so caffeine has been my only saving grace when it comes to a modicum of focus for work. \n\nI’ve already had the doctors tell me “it’s easy, just do this and keep track of this and do these things.” I know from experience, from before my ADHD diagnosis, that I can’t “just keep track of this” or “do these things.” It’s not within my capabilities. I had a good cry each day this week because being 33 and knowing that you’ve tried your best and your best is still going to kill you? That doesn’t feel good. \n\nAnyone else experience the repercussions of the fast and binge lifestyle that ADHD lends itself to? The food taste and texture hyperfixation/stim that forces you to opt out of eating if you can’t have that thing? I’m already experiencing this as I’m trying to eat the healthier things. The things that don’t scratch that itch my brain has been craving. \n\nWhat advice do you have if you’ve experienced this type of disordered eating? I’ve requested a referral to a nutritionist but I fear they’ll say something along the lines of “just do this” and not understand that I can’t “just do this.”",

But for me, it never comes if I don't want to do it, and the consequences aren't justified in my head/aren't real (email home to my parents is not exactly life-threatening, and honestly if my parents scream at me I feel like doing it even less then before). \n\nI feel very lucky to like practically all my subjects in school, and once I get started, I tend to enjoy working, but the struggle is so real when it comes to work I really don't want to do. Finishing something doesn't even bring me any pleasure, so what even is the point?\n\nI am medicated (methylphenidate), but it doesn't exactly help in this aspect, sure I get less distracted when I am doing the work, which helps, but this just seems like the biggest barrier in my life right now, and it always has been. I live in a state of constant anxiety due to work that is due, and the medication amplifies anxiety as well. But if I stop taking the meds, it will make it worse because then I won't do my work at all, even the work I want to do. I understand this will pass, but it doesn't make sense to struggle like this. \n\nOne thing that kind of works is trying to view things from a non-emotional standpoint (black and white), which helps, but it doesn't always work. I hope someone has some experience with this. As deadlines are approaching that I can't ask for an extension. It makes life seem hopeless when I can't do the things that I expect myself to be able to do.\n\nTL;DR: Kid with ADHD has problems with procrastination, more at 9",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI have just moved onto straterra after being on Elvanse/Vyvanse, which gave me a high heart rate of 100+, palpitations and pretty high BP and chest discomfort. My psychiatrist completely ruled out all stimulants because of this and prescribed Straterra.\n\nI am now on day 2 of Straterra at 40 mgs as a 71 kg 19 yr old male and I am also experiencing a higher BP of 130+ with 60-70 , and a pulse of around 80 (my normal one would be around 60), with some palpitations and occasional chest discomfort/moderate chest pain. I am worried about telling my doctor straight away because he would most likely also rule it out, leaving me only with Clonidine as an option which doesn’t seem great at all, and I have also seen people say that with Straterra they have experienced these side effects and they went away after a few weeks.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or tips on what I should do?",

But i got the flu yesterday or the night before, and ever since my heart rate has skyrocketed and I can feel my heart beating out of my chest and I'm very short of breath. I tested for covid and it came up negative, and of course I had an ECG before my meds so my heart is fine. Usually my heart rate goes pretty high when I stand up but today it stuck around 120-130 for hours! I felt horrific, lying down didn't fix it like usual. I measured my heart rate by counting instead of using my watch while I was lying down with my feet elevated and I counted 144! \nI had a pretty severe panic attack later, convinced I was having a heart attack is what set it off. Took off my watch (it was causing anxiety) and I had a quick shower and felt better emotionally, and even my heart chilled out a little at least sensation wise. But now I'm in bed, exhausted to a horrific degree, I feel like I'm on the verge of slipping off to a death slumber! But I can't even have a regular slumber, because my chest pain is still here and my breathing is so shallow it's causing anxiety. I'm having somewhat intrusive thoughts of me just dying in my sleep because of this. I'm not sure what to do, mum is taking me to the hospital tomorrow but I can't even sleep now! Do I just stay awake all night and pray I don't pass out tomorrow? Thanks for reading.",

I like my happy planner but for some reason my brain feels stock and how to use it for everything and when a Google I feel more overwhelmed. In speaking of overwhelmed I usually journal to help dump my thoughts so but I can't get myself to just sit down and journal. I don't want to use my phone since I'm always on my phone nowadays and what do you use at last except talking to my ldr partner. I don't know for some reason I feel like I'm having a hard time finding something that works for me I know it's not supposed to be for somebody else but still. So how do you guys get yourself to use your planners and journals and feel happy about it?",

Reading may feel like it takes forever, especially if you find that you have to read and re-read (and re-read again) to absorb the information accurately. We do so by providing simple, free and privacy-aware tooling for transforming a text based document into a format which allows the reader to more easily focus on its content.\n\n  \n**focal**point allows you to upload and transform Microsoft Word documents so that the beginning of each word is highlighted in bold. **Th**is **gui**des **t**he **ey**es **thr**ough **te**xt **wi**th **artif**icial **fo**cus **poi**nts. **A**s a **res**ult, **t**he **rea**der **i**s **le**ss **lik**ely **t**o **sk**ip **wor**ds, **sente**nces **o**r **parag**raphs **a**nd **st**ays **foc**used **o**n **t**he **nat**ural **fl**ow **o**f **t**he **te**xt.

That never pleased my grandmother, she wanted me on meds at a very early age and she would persistently  say theres something wrong with me to my therapist in front of me. I was put in special ed classes, I was very introverted and didnt talk much in school, didnt have many friends, and all the other kids talked about me in front of me because they thought I was that mentally disabled. My grandmother would also say things like whats wrong with you, why dont you have friends, a gf, activities, hobbies, or even decorations on my wall.(surprise its cuz she didnt like what i liked so i couldnt like it) All this plus other things have made me fear that people think in just a completely incapable idiot. I do things in weird steps at work, im clumsy, forgetfull, yet heavily relied on. Mostly because im the only adult working there who isnt a manager. Yet my boss and coworkers notice how I do things and will occasionally tease me for it. In past jobs ive had people come up to me and actually talk slowly because they think im an idiot.. or go out of there way to congratulate me for something simple. Now im not a dumb person.. probably.. however my favorite quote is you judge a golfish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its life thinking its useless. I have a lot to offer but the way things work and how people expect it.. it can be hard to really apply myself.",

The only thing I have now is how I look at the past, as in decisions I’ve made, projects I never finished, school stuff, all of those things, and it makes me feel kinda sad, as in thinking, wow, I never stood a chance, I was trying to run like everyone else and hadn’t realized that I had some ankle weight and was never at par as other people. I know I have to take it all in and evaluate everything, forgive myself and eventually let go of the things that weren’t under my control, it’s just the process and feeling sad right now.

No new meds, healthy diet, I don’t consume acidic drinks or citrus when I take my meds, I don’t drink, good sleep hygiene etc. I’ve tried supplements too. It’s frustrating. I don’t want to switch meds, Vyvanse has always worked for me. My life changed after therapy and getting on this medicine.

It feels like we *should* be able to do the work etc, but we can't, and it's a flip of a coin on how bad that actually is on any given day until the day is over and you're like \"damn, i managed literally nothing today\". I think I have a (partial) solution.\n\nWhat I do is visualize numbers counting up from one. White seven-segment display, black background. I count until I lose concentration, can't easily think of the next number, can't form it in my mind. Sometimes do it a couple times to check. And that gives me a very simple benchmark for how distracted I am at that moment.\n\nOn a good day, I can count around 12-15. On a bad day, I can't get past 4. The main point is that if I'm counting super low I know I need to take it easy, or have some strong tea, and if I'm counting quite high, I know it's the right time to do some work. I don't have to guess.\n\nI'm curious how this works, if at all, for everyone else. I imagine your baseline will probably be different, or maybe under 5 is a bad day for all of us. Maybe this is a good way of measuring how bad two people's adhds are in comparison to each other in general, maybe not. If you want, leave a comment with your \"count\" right now, we can all compare.",

I have bad IBS-C for most of my life, I manage it with Magnesium supplements, which is not at all ideal but it works. A while back I saw a GI consultant who did a colonoscopy &amp; endoscopy and everything came back clear but the consultant finally said that it may due to the neurotransmitters and may want to consider something like low dose prozac. \n\nI didn't pursue that at the time but now it's got me thinking about the fact that ADHD is considered to be a brain chemistry imbalance. Anyone else experience bad IBS-C ? Or an improvement in bowel regularity with meds ? I've tried all sorts of dietary changes, none have made it better/worse.\n\nThank you friends !",

I’m going out of town for a few days and really needed my meds so I can be present with the people I’m with.\n\nMy younger brother gave me a few of his Vyvanse 40mg prescription. I know it’s bad to take other peoples meds, it’s an entirely new medication and dosage. But holy shit. It works so well for me. I have the same level of focus Concerta gives me without the jitteriness and anxiety. \n\nI honestly am feeling so good, like lighter and more clear-headed. I want to bring this up to my doctor but I can’t say I tried my brothers adhd meds. Vyvanse seems to be in stock at the pharmacies near me, maybe I can make the switch. The higher dosage is also working so much better for me. I’m trying to figure out a way to bring this up to my doctor… any suggestions?",

        "text": "I've recently found that if I'm able to start working on something, then I can listen to intense soundtracks to prevent my brain from wandering or procrastinating as much.\n\nI think this is because daydreaming and procrastinating requires a more relaxed state, and so listening to an intense soundtrack makes it too jarring to allow myself to casually check the news etc. while the music is playing.\n\nI've found that movie soundtracks are great for this, because they're essentially theme and variation on a single song that lasts just over an hour. This means I can listen to it more before I wear it out.\n\nNormally, I prefer instrumental-only soundtracks. Recently though, I've had great success with the Run Lola Run soundtrack, where the lyrics are repetitive enough for it to still work [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9waAUbErluQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9waAUbErluQ)\n\nThe reason I think this particular soundtrack works so well is that it almost never relaxes. Other movie soundtracks, in contrast, are a mix of high-octane and relaxed tracks.\n\nCan anyone recommend any high-octane soundtracks similar to this one please? I know from experience that I'll wear this soundtrack out in a few days, and the effect will be diminished. Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "I take a very low dose of a C2 stimulant in extended-release form, so I wouldn't think it would raise any flags for misuse/diversion, and I don't try to fill it early. However, I've had numerous negative interactions with pharmacy techs whenever there's any kind of issue (backordered, they can't find the prescription, etc). In these conversations, the techs often sound impatient and even angry, and sometimes they mention controlled substance rules in a way that sounds accusatory. I am pretty good at staying calm, patient, and respectful in these conversations. I also don't think I'm asking for anything unusual or that would get them in trouble (e.g., most recently I just needed to know whether my drug was backordered so that I could ask my prescriber for an alternative), but I don't understand the rules well enough to know for sure. My med is not Adderall and this started long before the recent Adderall shortage.\n\nThese interactions are upsetting, and they're happening often enough that it's made me anxious about filling my prescriptions. I've tried several pharmacies, both chain and local. I've never had issues with the pharmacists, and some of the techs are lovely, but it's been hard to avoid those who get frustrated and angry. I found a great local pharmacy where everyone was kind, but I moved to a new city and now I'm having problems again.\n\nDoes anyone have tips for avoiding these negative interactions? Maybe that's a different type of pharmacy, avoiding something I'm doing that is suspicious, understanding the C2 rules better so that I'm not making annoying requests, etc... I'd sincerely appreciate any ideas!",
