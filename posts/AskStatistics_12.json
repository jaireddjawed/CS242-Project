(i.e. time, error, etc). \n\nMy friend thinks it is independent because each system is independent from each other, since they're built differently (one system uses a touchpad and another system uses keyboard and mouse, although the tasks are the same).",

But most of my peers seem to use GraphPad Prism for its simplicity and ease of use and since I'm someone who tends to overcomplicate things that may be beneficial. I think with our uni license both will be around the same price.\n\nI know there's R and other programs too, but I currently don't have the time for a steep learning curve and to learn a new language, esp. considering it's probably going to be a one-time thing.

I have Stat 2 and Bayesian left to take and I will complete my coursework. Coming to thesis, my advisor only wants me to work with some data analysis project using NIS data over years and present a report. I get it, whoever has done it, but it doesn’t require more than just modifying the variables and put the code in to get some results. For some reason, I cannot get myself to choose some data analysis project as my masters thesis as I am hoping for a good PhD program. Is it too ambitious for me? I want to do a thesis regarding something Bayesian but every time I bring this thing up, my advisor asks me to get the data myself and analyse it.

The author says that r-squared isn’t necessarily important if you’re only interested in the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. They give the example of two charts, one with an r-squared of 0.143 and one with an r-squared of 0.865. The independent variable is significant at p &lt; 0.001 for both. \n\nHow does the low r-squared not change the interpretation of the independent variable? \n\nIn the first, the variable is correlated but explains very little of the variation. In the second, the variable is similarly correlated and explains most of the variation. So I wouldn’t conclude that both independent variables are equally important when understanding the dependent variable, right?",

I want the differences between these two tests to be within +/-1.0 unit, so I’m performing an equivalence test.\n\nBelow are my assumptions about alpha, confidence intervals, and power of my test. \n\nI *believe* if I set my alpha at 0.05, then I’m using a 90% confidence interval (because I’m doing two one sided t tests). Let’s say my 90% confidence interval of my measurements is +/-0.8 units, then I would conclude 90 / 100 follow up measurements on the same sample should report a difference within +/-0.8 units. \n\nAnd because this confidence interval falls within my +/-1.0 unit criteria, I’d conclude that there is no difference between these two measurements. \n\nNow with power, I believe I’m measuring the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e. detecting a difference in the two tests &gt;+/-1.0 units). So if I have 80% power then I’m saying 80 / 100 follow up measurements on the same sample will find a difference of &gt;+/-1.0 units if there is one. \n\nIs this all correct or am I missing something here?",

        "text": " \n\nVery confused re: trial designs for a systematic review / meta-analysis I'm conducting. We have a set of studies that focuses on patients with disease X. The studies have what I thought to be a \"case series\" design (All patients in the study have disease X \\[almost always, the patients are retrospectively selected from a patient database, they are consecutive cases\\], they receive Y intervention, and the authors assess for Z outcomes 0-3 months following Y intervention. Some statistics are calculated like event rate of certain outcomes (some summary statistics of the patient sample, other times, event rate of a specific outcome Z following Y intervention, some studies will do a regression analysis of patient characteristics as independent vars vs. Z outcome as the dependent variable).\n\nI'm struggling to conceptually understand if these are truly case series or are \"single-arm cohort\" studies? The only reason I'm focused on this distinction is that I have to use the approrpriate risk of bias tool for publication bias in my systematic review and the tools differ for case series vs. cohort studies. This paper has me extremely confused ([https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0391-8](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-017-0391-8)). I feel like it states that the same paper with a case series design can in effect be reconceptualized as a cohort study based on how you are analyzing the data at hand.\n\nThe studies do not have a control arm, and there is no selection based on \"exposure\" per se (with an assessment of outcome based on exposure status, as I guess would be expected with a cohort study). There is also no comparison group necessarily that is defined prior to the intervention Y (i.e. all patients receive intervention Y, and are generally similar in terms of prior exposures). The only time comparisons are made in these studies are when the patient sample is split based on characteristics that are observed *after* intervention Y, and compared . For example, some of these studies will split initial group of patients based on initial outcomes after intervention Y (e.g. some pts have positive initial response after intervention Y vs. others have poor initial response, and then the authors will compare these two subsets using the appropriate statistical method). Would a hypothetical study like the one just described be a cohort study or a case series?\n\nWe are using data to calculate the event rate for a specific outcome Z that these studies quantify. I'm inclined to say these are \"case series\" for our purposes because all the patients receive intervention Y and we're simply focused on the event rate of a specific outcome Z of the patients.\n\nHowever, to complicate things, we're only looking at a specific subset of patients that receive intervention Y (i.e. after patients receive intervention Y, some have a specific initial response, and we focus on the event rate of outcome Z in this specific subset of patients). Since we're only focused on this unique subset of patients defined by its characteristic that is only evident AFTER intervention Y, would this be an \"exposure\" / risk factor that we are focused on, and since we are looking for a specific outcome, this could be a cohort design (at least for our purposes)?\n\nThanks in advance!! apologies if this is vague and hypothetical, happy to provide more specifics / details.",

        "text": "I need a bit of help / nudge in the right direction. I am currently wrapping up my MS in Applied Statistics and have learned a ton about the subject. Recently I was approached by one of our business partners at work (I work in a data &amp; analytics team) asking about developing a solution for sampling from a population of worked alerts/tickets. In short - this team performs a QA/QC function on tickets that were closed for a given period of time. Just some basic info to provide more clarity:\n\n\\- They are applying stratified sampling - they are using the analyst/employee who closed the alert as one strata and the disposition of the alert and the second strata.\n\n\\- Currently they are sampling daily, but eventually want to move to weekly.\n\n\\- For sampling they want to make sure that all analysts and alert dispositions are represented in the sample - but noted if the number of analysts exceed the sample size, we'd include all analysts (aka, increase the sample size)\n\nThis is something they are doing themselves right now, but want my team to automate. After speaking to them, I have some concerns about their methodology, but wanted to see if the community could chime in. They are using the following calculator to determine sample size:\n\n[http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html](http://www.raosoft.com/samplesize.html)\n\nBased on the documentation, this assumes a normal distribution, which I am not entirely convinced we have. When I pulled the thread on this a bit, asking them why they chose this tool, I didn't get any compelling reasons why they did. They did say they are sticking to a 95-5 for the confidence level / margin of error. There seems to be no mathematical reasoning behind these choices either.\n\nNow, to my questions:\n\n1. For a data set like this - if I am performing stratified sampling across two strata (or could be more) - what is a good way to determine the distribution of these data?\n2. I ask #1, since I \\*think\\* I should probably know how the data are distributed in order to determine proper sampling methodology / size. If I do not need to know how the data are distributed, what is the proper way to determine sample size for these data?\n3. It seems off that they'd determine sample size, then decided to increase that if they have more analysts working alerts than the sample size. Is this normal or should those counts be considered before they determine sample size?\n\nA basic example could be that we have 1500 alerts closed in a day. Of these, let's say we have 20 analysts closing them with three different dispositions (Closed 1, Closed 2, Closed 3). In short, I am trying to:\n\n1. Consult to the business on proper sampling methodology so we can provide documentation to any auditing teams that my ask about it later. This was I can provide statistical evidence to the methodology.\n2. Understand the proper way to sample data like these, so I can implement it in our analysis.\n\nThanks in advance!",

But why does this happen, and why is it always in the direction of the effect being inflated , rather than also being shrunk? Because if it's just about there being larger errors, then surely it should be just as likely to underestimate the effect size?\n\nAnd is this really a big deal, or is it simply a case of pointing out that it will be a little inflated? Because using the code below, I can see it is only increasing the cohen's d by about 0.05 (or so) standard units. When people brought this up, it was as though they had committed an unforgivable sin.\n\n Here is the python code:\n\n    import numpy as np\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    from scipy import stats\n    \n    def makediffs(truediff, n, m):\n        # n: sample size\n        # m: number of simulated studies\n        null = np.random.normal(0, 1, (n, m))\n        diff = np.random.normal(truediff, 1, (n, m))\n        diffs = null - diff\n        result = {'mean': diffs.mean(axis=0), 'sd': diffs.std(axis=0)}\n        result['d'] = result['mean'] / result['sd']\n        return result\n    \n    def plot_results(res):\n        fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(15,5))\n        ax[0].plot(res['mean'])\n        ax[1].plot(res['d'])\n        ax[0].axhline(0, lw=1, c='k')\n        ax[1].axhline(0, lw=1, c='k')\n        ax[0].set(title=f'mean (mean={res[\"mean\"].mean()})', ylim=(-1.5, 1.5))\n        ax[1].set(title=f'$d$ (mean={res[\"d\"].mean()})', ylim=(-1.5, 1.5))\n        plt.show()\n\nSo here I tested a true mean difference of 0.5 over 500 simulations with a small sample of n=10:\n\n    meandiff = 0.5\n    n = 10\n    nsims = 500\n    \n    res = makediffs(meandiff, n, nsims)\n    plot_results(res)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[n=10](https://preview.redd.it/motm65gfkn8a1.png?width=1213&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f610535122c96c1f383095d6685eb6a6c73bffdf)\n\nWhereas here I tested the same but increased it to n=50:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[n=50](https://preview.redd.it/r078jomikn8a1.png?width=1217&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a28e7058bbc6a199d6d35d1848b9338146ea7d29)",

I want to identify the n-highest/lowest price hours in a given day for each asset. For example, I'd like to identify the 4 highest hours and the 4 lowest hours on each date. \n2. I'd like to create a new table with the difference between the sum or average of the n-highest/lowest hours for each day, plus other statistics about that day (min/max price). I can then generate basic descriptive stats about that day (e.g., STDEV of spreads between n-highest/lowest hours)\n3. This isn't a one-off task, so I don't want to tackle it in Excel. Since there are infinitely many  assets I can analyze, I'd like to be able to perform this sort of analysis on new assets in the future. \n\nQuestion: What systems would you use for this? What's the easiest tool / platform / language for a non-data science professional to learn how to do this on their own over a reasonable period of time (3-9 months)\n\nContext: I've looked at visualization tools like like Power BI to see if I can jump to a solution... but I don't think these will provide what I'm looking for. \n\nThanks so much!!",

The idea is to reject the null hypothesis that the two sample means are equal, in favor for the alternate hypothesis that sample 2's mean is *bigger than* sample 1's. In other words, I'm not trying to test that they're merely different.\n\n[Here's what I did,](https://i.imgur.com/oNAJg5T.png) though don't worry about the number themselves. I'm sure I transcribed the formulas correct, and if not, well, sucks to be me. Anyway, I'm only wondering if:\n\n1) The formulas at the top are correct.\n\n2) I'm interpreting the results at the bottom correctly. So, for the second t-test on the right, if I was merely testing that the means are different, I would input the t statistic 2.1942 on a two-tailed t-table with 73 df and find that I can reject the null at p = .95, but can't reject the null at p = .98. However, since I'm specifically testing if sample 2 has a bigger mean than sample 1, that means I use a right-tailed t-table, and thus I can reject the null at p = .98, but can't reject at p = .99.\n\nThoughts?
