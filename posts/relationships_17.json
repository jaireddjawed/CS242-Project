        "text": "I have a huge crush on my classmate (she likes women), like I’m actually in love with her. Maybe it’s wishful thinking but I think she might have a crush on me too. I want to be as certain as possible before I even think of making a move, because we are friends - not the closest, but still - and I don’t want to potentially ruin a friendship. I don’t have any romantic experience, (I’m closeted), so I’ll just list any hints I can think of and please tell me if they’re flirty/fruity or not, and what the next steps can be!\n\n\nShe hugs me any chance she gets, sometimes they’re quite long hugs, sometimes we’ll rock back and forth. I don’t believe it’s a close-enough friendship to warrant such deep hugs but I love it 🥰\n\n\nShe calls me beautiful. “Hi beautiful!” or “hey beautiful woman!” I also once sent her a meme of someone singing “you’re so beautiful to me” to their cat and she replied “how I feel whenever [my name] passes by”. \n\n\nShe gets happy when we bump into each other on campus. Always greets me with a cute “it’s [my name]! [My name] is a person!” or “I found a [my name] in the hallway!” or wraps her arm around my shoulders. Always with a big smile. She once wrapped her arm around my shoulders and reintroduced me to a guy I already know (she knew that lol) as “this is [my name], she is the best person in the world”.\n\n\nShe’s the sweetest person I’ve ever met and I love her. She likes me too, I just don’t know if it’s romantic or platonic. She is generally a very loving person so I don’t know if I should take these hints seriously. Is there any way I can tell if she likes me without outright asking and embarrassing myself? Please advise! And if you have any questions for clarity, please ask.\n\nThank you!!\n\nTLDR: I think my crush is being flirty with me but I need advice on how I can be sure!",

        "text": "\nNot going to make this long but essentially my dad was verbally abusive (he’s spanked us but I think that’s normal in his gen I’m not bothered by it).\n\nHe labels us as \"lazy Canadian kids, you don’t know anything\" whenever we tend to argue when we were much younger. He would bully us like this all the time and make us feel really small. If I tried screwing something and he saw me struggle he’d laugh at me then take it from my hands and do it himself. I didn’t learn a lot from my dad aside from being an egotistical maggot. \n\nWhen I confronted him about my terrible situation in high school he bullied me in my face saying I should’ve fought back the kids who were picking on me when he knew da*n well I did but there were too many of them. He even tells me \"if someone called me names I wouldn’t mind, it’s not a big deal\" completely ignoring the fact I was hospitalized from the beatings. He feels like life wasn’t fair to him because he didn’t get a chance to reach his full potential by going to university and being on top of everybody else (he quite literally believes he’s better than everyone around him it’s breath taking). \n\nBlamed his kids for not being able to go to school also now he’s working as a mail man. I told him I’m in therapy dealing with my trauma and he started talking to my brother behind my back saying I never appreciated him changing my diapers as a child and how he funded my education. He never paid for my education I don’t know where he came up with this lie even. \n\nHe went to his friends and bragged about this job I got recently and made up some big lies about how big the company is, my salary etc. Even one step further, he told them I’m dating a model! Such lies I’m in disbelief! When I talk to him, I still feel like he undermines me and sees me as a clueless kid still. I hate his guts to be 100% sincere I don’t love my father the way I use to think I did when I was a child. I’ve even dreamed about beating his a** countless times.\n\nWhat do I do? He makes me feel invalidated and useless even at this age I just don’t like this guy at all. He thinks I’m weak because I dropped out of school and can’t handle life. I made it clear I’m mentally dealing with trauma and he doesn’t get it. He apologized for not doing his best job in helping me when I was dealing with some issues then he wraps up the apology like \"really sorry about that but as we all know, no one is perfect so we should take our mistakes as a learning lesson. Love you son\".\n\nEdit - if it’s relevant, my father was a bully as a teenage (14-18). He’d go out with his possy and look for fights often.\n\nTDLR - our dad raised us being a bully and it affects my mental health don’t know what to do",

I told her to do what’s best for her and got mad because she decided to text that while I was at work. \n\nWhen my sister (26f) and gf first met my sister would say crazy stuff to her like “what dudes were you sleeping with before you met my sister” (we are lesbians) she asked that because I got cheated on by my ex. and she would also stick up her middle finger randomly at her and telling her stuff like “I would be mad at my bf if they had an ex on Facebook”  and would just stir the pot for no reason. My gf has been nothing but nice honestly and strings things off , even sent us home made bracelets. \n\nYesterday I told my gf me and my sister was going to the club and she asked “who’s all going” my sister hopped in the camera and stuck up her middle finger and said “her new girlfriend” \n\nMy girlfriend got upset and got off the phone with me. Now she texting me saying she doesn’t want to deal with my lack of boundaries I have with my sister and I told her she’s acting like the ex females I had in my life and I dealt with all of this before and I told her how she thinks she so perfect and that my sister was only joking. I also said she always has a problem and I told her my sis is like that with everyone, it’s not our problem, it’s hers. She said she wouldn’t allow her family to disrespect me in that way ever and said she will distance herself and I got mad at her for saying this. I told her yesterday I would be hanging with my sister and said why would she ask a question she already knew the answer to? She shouldn’t get mad she got a smart ass answer back. \n\nAm I wrong for this? I’m upset because I feel she takes my sister word for everything she says and get upset and feel she doesn’t trust me all because my sister being childish. She said she trust me but still thought it was rude and I allow my sister to do and say whatever. Why is she allowing my sister to upset her so much. Why can’t she just confidently brush it off because she trust me and know it’s not true? She got off the phone , why do I have to suffer the consequences , my sister said it not me. \n\nWe are long distant btw. And her concern is that she has to deal with this in person. But I have faith it will all work out.",

Idk if I’m being abused mentally and financially I do not work atm I am currently studying to pass an licensing exam. Noticed things start to change when we got married and he got this well paying job. We’ve been together for 6 years one year married. I feel like I can’t speak my mind and defend myself anymore it feels like I’m being manipulated. Certain things he says to me or argues to me about. I feel powerless just bc I don’t have any income I think he thinks he can control my life. He asks why I need money when I ask for money, he thinks he’s entitled to my car because we’re married and his car is a pos and he pays for all the gas in my car. He doesn’t want to put my name on the house he is buying because I don’t make any income. I feel like a burden, like he’s so ready for me to get off his dime. keep in mind when he had nothing and no money I had to work two jobs and go to school to help him pay all of his bills and rent that’s also including all of my bills I had to pay. I stopped asking him for money to help pay my bills. I had to start asking my own father to help me. :/ I hate confrontation with him bc he’ll end up screaming at me and twisting my words around. I just don’t know how to tackle this. I want control of my life back idk if he even thinks he’s doing anything wrong or does he know what he’s doing which is way worse imo Idk I feel like I’m going crazy",

However in my late teens/early 20s my OCD made me an akward guy. One reason that has me worried is that practically all my friends have relationships in which they’ve been together for years and they’re my age, some of them are even married already or have proposed.\n\nThe other reason that has me worried is that I’m going bald, even though I’m good looking that is indeed happening so I always use a baseball cap. Anyways, anyone know what the problem may be? Is there some kind of statistic on this? Does it just get more difficult from here on forward?\n\nTl;dr: I’m a 25 y/o male who’s good looking and wealthy but have had no luck with girls and I’m just wondering if it’s going to get harder with age.",

        "text": "So I (22M) have my group of friends, which we will call friend 1 (22 m) 2 (22m) 3(23m) and 4 (23 m). I have been friends for a long time since middle school (all this might be important for context) and when we graduated high school we decided to go to college together in order to go trough the journey together friend 3 and I talked about what degree and I decided I would pursue a degree in mechanical engineering to which friend 3 decided to agree on and the rest just kinda followed with the idea. \n\nHowever once covid hit everyone decided to \"drop due to covid\" since the school said there would not be a negative impact on our record but I didn't stop I decided to keep going regardless of covid since I wanted to get over with college to transfer to university. \n\n\nWell, friend 4 ended up dropping out, saying he realized it rly wasn't for him since he wasn't good at school, which I completely understood and respected his choice. Tbh he the only one that rly doesn't give any comments on uni or st least that I remember \n\n\nFriend 3  went for about another year but also decided to drop out he didn't rly give me a reason, just saying he was good like that and went to work with his dad. But recently he made a comment where he said that all my brains are just going to wasting my money in university to which I honestly didn't know how to respond so and other times he'll give comments like all that school and he still doesn't see me anywhere ahead of him to show for it whenever I say that at least im trying to get an education (we live with our parnets and ik its not something to be proud about but I do it because I got to university everyone else used to have the same reason but idk anymore I do plan on moving out as soon as I graduate tho)\n\n\nThe rest kept going but at a slower pace and I kept hearing how they kept dropping classes due to not passing or straight up faling classes and just last fall I graduated with an associates and hot accepted into uni as a transfer student and that's where friend 1 started making comments like \"when do u even get experience for having a job\" or \"see u can know how to do math but I know how to actually  put it all together (in terms of mechanical stuff since he works with trucks in his dads business and we are in mechanical engineering) and he even started saying things like \"idk sometimes I think how I'm gonna be wasting my time and money going to university just to get a job that pays around 70k a year\" or things like \"man I know I cam just make more money making a business than going to college\" stuff like that while he started taking fewer and fewer classes until this semester where he didn't take any classes saying he was taking a break and that he'd go back in during summer but tbh idk of that's rly gonna happen recently we were talking about what I'm doing in uni since he wants to know what in learning and I joined a club where they work on making a formula car and how I was helping manufacture it but he said \"oh yea but that's stuff I already know I do it all the time\" which maybe since again he works with trucks but still the comments I notice them \n\nFinally friend 2 has started doing a similar pattern schedule wise where he is taking less and less and now only took 1 online class this semster and when he heard of what I'm doing he suddenly started going with his uncle to learn about cars in order to learn more of that. He also says he wants to fo engineering but when I ask him if he's interested in actually going he says no because he feels like university is too much for him but feels like he doesn't fit in in a classroom especially because he thinks its unnecessary and too expensive to be wasting his money on and usually talks about how he's learning woth his uncle or whatever. I honestly don't get him he wants to do it but at the same time had a negative attitude to it\n\nSo Idk what to think of all this with all of them giving me similar commentary I wanted to see what people thought about it is it rly a waste like they say or should it be something to be ignored. Also incase anyone is wondering I am currently the only one in university apart from friend 4 and 3 who dropped out early friend 1 is currently in his \"break\"  but isn't near finishing community College and friend 2 is currently also around the same level as friend 1 where they are barely in freshman to sophomore courses \n\nTl;dr my friends I have had since high school decided to go to college together however most have dropped out while the rest fell behind before dropping out and now make coments indicating I waste my money in uni because I either haven't shown much with it or they can do better elsewhere where I waste my money.",

I’m there for her and buy her flowers when something rough happens at work and we see each other at the weekends anyway . \n\n\nThis time she didn’t even bother to tell me she had different plans or ask me over , or plan to come to me at any point in future , she just didn’t say anything at all .

Early on he never really mentioned depression or suicidal thoughts but over the year or so this has been a constant theme. He has sort of lost all his friends, dislikes his job and kind of goes through ups and downs of not leaving the house/getting drunk to excerising everyday and barely spending time together. Through this is regularly mentions being depressed since he was 10 years old and not wanting to live past 30. I came across his journal, never knew he had one and yes I shouldn’t have read it, but it’s just him talking about wanting to end it and being tired of fighting. I mentioned to him he should talk to someone and mentioned if I should call the police when he goes on rants about not wanting to live but he will always threaten to end himself right now if I do.\n\n\n\nI’m really not sure what to do at this point. He’s currently in a phase of not talking or leaving the bed. I love him and want to help but not sure what is the best path. Any thoughts on what to do? \n\n\n\n**TL;DR:** depressed bf.

I thought I used to be pretty but I'm very picky about guys, I want a guy who's tall, handsome, and has straight teeth and is in shape with no acne. That's it. The most a man ever spent on me on a date is a measly 30 dollars whereas other girls I have heard of get taken to 300 dollar places and get wined and dined. \n\nBut most guys on dating apps post selfies in stained sweatpants, look short, and seem to want to be \"courted\" like women nowadays.

The men on Tinder don't seem to do this.\n\nI'm worried I'm losing my looks and that it's too late and I'm hopeless and if I'm already this old and have never been bought flowers or bought jewelry, I never will.

        "text": "Tl;dr - My now boyfriend of 8 months cheated* in the very beginning of our relationship and it still haunts me. Need advice. \n\nThe cheating is somewhat grey area, he claims we were “exclusive” but not yet bf/gf during the time he slept with other women. Regardless, it involved a lot of deceit. We had about 4 serious conversations (some face to face) during the time he was sleeping with other women, and he would lie to me. I would confront him that I had a weird feeling, and was worried for my sexual health and well-being, and he would promise he was only seeing me. He would get away with it and do it again. I do not think he slept with anyone else after our final exclusivity conversation, which he considers to be when we became bf/gf. And am almost positive he hasn’t cheated on me after I found out and confronted him about the “grey area” cheating a few weeks into being bf/gf, however I still have a hard time with this and am wondering if anyone else has ever been in a similar situation that has advice or relationship wisdom to impart.\n\nCan type more on his efforts to restore trust after the incident later ….. he is trying but I’m not blown away.  I catch him in a few white lies here and there, and he also doesn’t have the best follow through with things he says he will do but otherwise is a good boyfriend. I do love him, and know ultimately it’s up to me if I want to work through the past. Additional context: he’s 35 I’m 31 seeking marriage and kids. I’m his first girlfriend since college..\n\nTyping from iPhone add more details/ fine tune later :)",

We started slow, but soon found we instantly clicked on all deep level.\n\nWe fell in love, began to have sleepovers many nights a week. I would take her on dates, listen to her feelings, buy her gifts, enjoy quality one on one time with her, and have the best sex I’ve ever given to a woman.\n\nI thought it was a no brainer that we would continue dating after college but she is now leaving me to focus on her career and self after graduation. \n\nI was never a push over despite how good I was to her, when she hurt me I vocalized it respectfully making sure to never yell or say anything wild out of anger.\n\nPart of me is sad because I loved her so intensely. Another part of me is looking forward to the future. I already have gym and new diet plans in place. Also the idea of starting my career gives me hope. \n\nLong story short, I guess nothing is guaranteed. Even if you are a great bf, if she doesn’t see ur worth she just doesn’t see it. She even told me she is scared she will regret this for years to come lol 🤷🏽‍♂️\n\nTLDR: Gf of which I treated so well decided to leave me because she wants to focus on her career and herself after college graduation. I treated her better then any of her exs did, and she said she will most likely regret leaving me at some point",

At first i thought i was just settling into our relationship or that the honeymoon phase is ending but i think the honeymoon phase ended a while ago. I don’t think it’s normal to feel like this. \n\nI don’t feel excited to see him anymore. On the drive to his house i feel dread and once i get there i realize i just don’t want to be there. I don’t know why because there’s been no problems in our relationship that could make me feel like this. I don’t feel like calling him or texting him. I often leave him on delivered for hours because i just don’t feel like talking to him. He’s the only person i do this with. I don’t compliment him anymore and i don’t say i love you unless he says it first. \n\nI know a lot of people think that if you fall out of love it means you were never really in love. My boyfriend is one of those people. I disagree because I know that at one point i loved him more than anything. I was in love with him long before we started dating (we’ve been friends for 7 years). I just feel different now\n\nI can tell he’s starting to realize something is wrong. I’m torn between ending things with him because he doesn’t deserve this and i don’t want to hurt him more. Part of me wants to stay with him and wait it out because maybe things will get better. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like an awful person. Advice? \n\nTLDR; I’m no longer interested in talking to my boyfriend/spending time with him. I’m growing more distant from him and i don’t know why. I’m unsure if i should break things off to save him from getting more hurt or waiting a bit to see if things get better.",

I was in this situationship with a girl where we were emotionally close and physically intimate, and she brought a new guy into her life after she thought I wasn't interested in her anymore. Her new guy told her to cut me off and she did. I was deeply hurt by the fact that she actually cut me off. After I clarified things, she wanted to come back to me hoping to start afresh after 2 months with her new guy. Later she confessed that she had slept with her new guy. Now I am conflicted. I feel like I want to take her back because of all the good times we shared, But I also feel like I am disrespecting myself if I take her back knowing that she had slept with her new guy while knowing my feelings for her.\n\nTL;DR: As much as I want to trust her story, I can't help but feel like she's left something out. Things don't feel the same anymore now that she has brought a person into her world whom I can't ignore. She doesn't want to cut him off either. What should I do?",

        "text": "I (37F) recently got into a big fight with my mom (64F). I’m not sure if  I’m in the right here or not or if I should be doing something else.  Explanation below.\n\nTo begin with, depression runs in my family. My only sibling passed away a few years ago.\n\nBoth  I and my parents (mom included) did everything we could to try to help  my sibling. That included my mother reaching out to my sibling’s doctors  to try to provide information that might help them (e.g., my sibling  was abusing psychiatric prescription drugs unbeknownst to her multiple  psychiatrists that were unaware of each other) and to avoid my sibling  from doing irreparable harm to themself. Unfortunately, none of that was  enough.\n\nNow moving to present  day. My mother is depressed, in part because of my sibling, but to be  honest, my mother has been depressed as far back as I can remember (in a  very similar manner to my sibling, albeit her self-destructive behavior  is more passive). As a result, she does not take care of her health as  well as she should and often makes comments implying she doesn’t care  about herself.\n\nNo matter how I try  to talk to my mother about her mental health and trying to get her to  meet with a professional, she won’t hear it and just shuts down.\n\nThe  current issue is that my mother has diabetes that has gotten out of  control. She has only been on the diabetes pill and has not yet tried  insulin (which is likely needed). Fear of needles or lack of knowledge  isn’t the issue (my mother is retired from a medical-related field).  Today, (as she often unproductively complains about her health) she said  that she said that her blood sugar has gotten very out of control, but  she’s just going to wait for whenever her doctor requests new blood  tests at some indeterminate point in the future to deal with it (despite  my requesting she take a more active approach).\n\nI  happen to have the same primary doctor as my mother, so I sent a  message to our doctor asking her to reach out to my mother to arrange  those tests, as I knew my mother wasn’t going to. Given the recency of  my conversation with the doctor, my mother realized I was the cause  behind the doctor reaching out to her and is furious with me because she  sees this as an invasion of her privacy.\n\nOn  one hand, I get where she is coming from as I see how each person’s  medical choices should be their own. On the other, I’m stuck here  watching her allow her health to deteriorate, and if she went into a  diabetic coma (or had any other severe complications), I know I’d never  be able to get over the thought that I didn’t try to do something.\n\nI’m  really stuck in my own head, so I’d love to get some external  perspectives if I’m being selfish here by just doing what I think is  best against my mother’s wishes. For those who have been in similar  positions, what have you done? I feel like there are no good options.\n\ntl;dr My mom's being self-destructive and I'm not sure what I should do.",

        "text": "I (20M) was in a relationship with my gf (20F) for about a year and a half. This year, I loved her so much and literally gave my all to her, but didn't get much in return. When I asked her and talked to her about it, she said she \"has no energy not even for herself\" and she has \"many personal and family problems\". About a month ago, we decided that we would part ways forever after finding out that she told my friend that she loved him very much and did some drama with him (That's cheating ig) but that actually never happened.\nWe came back as \"friends\" and that didn't happen as well. In that period, I kept loving her so much too. I also got her a book in that period! I also made her a playlist on spotify with my favourite songs and our photo on the cover. With all that done, I didn't even feel any gratitude from her so eventually I gave up.\nAbout a week ago, I told her that I was gonna leave her forever and so. She thanked me for what I had done and said that she doesn't want to lose me as a person bla blah blah blah. When I calmed down, I suggested that we increase the distance between us and put up boundaries so we don't lose each other at all we have been friends for 6 years or so). She asked if we could be friends and over time we get closer again and I agreed. Is it even normal to stay friends with her and increase our distance over time til we eventuallv come back to each other?\nThis is what I truly regret. I don't want her in my life at all and I truly want to let her out of my life. The problem is that I can't leave her behind. Idk why I just can't leave her at all. It's like a fight between mt brain and heart really. 2 days ago, I really felt that I don't love her anymore. What I want now is to just leave her behind. I don't want to stay friends with her whatsoever or get closer by any chance. I saw her effect on me and how I've lost focus on important parts of my life because of her and I don't want to repeat that. I really wanna end it all with her without even friendship and never come back but idk how. Can somone help me?\n\nTLDR: My ex wants to come back as my friend and get closer to me by time and I don’t want that anymore. Idk if it’s okay to stay friends with her or not. I want to end it all with her but I fear regretting that and missing even a friendship with her",

        "text": "So this may sound odd at first, but my boyfriend(19) and I (20) are trans. I love and support him dearly in everything he does and he does the same for me, we've been best friends for years before we ever even acknowledged any feelings for the other ans have been dating the last 6 months. I know his greatest wants, hopes and worst fears and experiences. I only ever want the best for him, which is why the fact he can never speak to his family, aside from a select few again.\n\nYou see, he's Egyptian not only by blood but nationality and culture. He was raised there and only moved here a few years ago. Most of his Family still does live there, the only reason they moved here (England) was because his youngest brother had a heart defect that was simply too dangerous and expensive to treat back home, and they just stayed once he was finished his treatment.\n\nHe came out as trans several years agoans his mother was a lot less then supportive. His siblings struggled at first, but eventually became supportive, one of them even coming out later aswell. he struggles talking about his family, but from what I know, I'm pretty sure there's only at maximum 3 other family members, none of which still live in Egypt who would support him and his transition.\n\nhe also told me that if he ever plans on visiting his own country, as a man, he would not only have to pretend he doesn't know any of his family, but likely renounce his citizenship. \n\nIt's approaching his grandfather's death anniversary, and he's letting me take him out for a meal at his grandfather's favourite restaurant from when he used to visit them before he died, atleast to try help him grieve a little more, and I've suggested doing something with his siblings and grandmother if they'd be willing to include me in such a private thing, (I never got the chance to meet the man, as he died a year or two before I met my boyfriend)\nBut this is all hitting him really hard, especially since he's about to start his legal and medical transition, so he can't even go back under his deadname.\n\nI want to help him, but I don't know how. While I'm trans too and understand what it's like to transition especially with a less than supportive household, it's nothing compared to his situation and I'm white English, so I don't threaten to loose part of my culture or birthplace by transitioning.\n\nI know there are parts of him I can never fully understand but I want to try help him any way I can, so any advice for me Reddit?\nAlso if you're reading this at all ya roohi, (because I know you use Reddit a lot more than I do) I love you and I wish I could take your pain away.\n\nTL:DR because of his culture my boyfriend has to choose, transitioning or family and culture. any advice on how I, the white partner, can help?",

        "text": "Okay, I’m going to try to make this make sense. I’m sorry that it’s so long I didn’t know how to condense it. \n\nBackground: I’ve been in a serious relationship since October ‘22. My bf (37) and I (25) started off rocky. Meaning that I thought it was a hookup thing and then caught feelings and then found out he’s married with a kid. Since then, he spends every night here and a good chunk of his days. there are some times where I get a little suspicious, but I choose to trust him and I think he’s telling the truth. He says she knows and that they’ve discussed separating and he’s at the point where he just needs to get a lawyer. But nothing is official and while he spends a lot of time at my place, he showers and works over at the house he shares with her. He also tries to spend some time with his kid everyday (which I fully support and am 100% behind) I’ve offered for him to share more of my space (I live alone) but he just always says that he doesnt want to impose. \n\nOnto the big issue: \n he says his wife had cheated on him (which he claims this is where he checked out of their marriage and then he met me some months after) and of how we got together (him cheating on his wife) because of this he has a lot of insecurities. He constantly thinks I’m going behind his back and fooling around on him. He questions what I wear and why, he questions when my phone rings, he questions what I do all day at home. And it doesn’t matter what I tell him. He just won’t believe me. He asks what I did all day and I’ll say nothing (which is basically true- I’m a student with mostly online classes and I only work weekend late nights. So I study and do whatever I want around my house and I basically just wait for him to come over.) and he’ll say “yeah right” and it doesn’t matter what I say. We’ll go out, he gets incredibly possessive. [ex. We went out, while I was standing at the bar, another person was standing next to me closing out their tab, and they turned to me to comment on how low their tab was.  He came from across the bar to stand between us and basically give the other person a ‘back off’ face and proceeded to shove his tongue in my mouth. This guy doesn’t even like to hold hands in Walmart. He was then mad at me the rest of the night. It was so uncomfortable for everyone. The next week the same person came up to me and was like “I hope you know I wasn’t hitting on you. Your bf seemed really mad. “] \n\nLast night, my phone rang. It was late, like 2am. It was my best friend. We were both sleeping and it woke us up, but I declined the call and tried to go back to sleep. He got up, got dressed, refused to lay down and after an hour of poking and prodding (verbally) I finally got out of him that he was upset with me about it. He said he shouldn’t have to put up with booty calls in the middle of the night.   Which is valid and I agree, but this wasn’t a booty call. He didn’t believe me. I offered to show him the call log and see that it was just them. He refused. I tried to keep talking with him but he just shuts down. He stayed on the couch in the living room, fully dressed with shoes on. When I got frustrated and made the mistake of letting my frustration show (I told him to stay on the fucking couch if that’s what he wanted) he got more upset with me. Told me how hard it is to leave home and have your old life be ruined and I don’t understand. How he doesn’t have a home anymore and he has nothing and is going through everything alone and now I’m making him feel unwanted and unwelcome. We went back and forth for a long while and didn’t get anywhere and eventually I just passed out. This morning he left and is mostly ignoring me, with the occasional text repeating what he said last night and we’re once again not getting anywhere. \n\nI understand that he is going through a lot of stuff rn and I have been as patient and calm as I can be while dealing with my own shit. But I don’t know who is in the wrong here. Is he being unreasonable or am I not being understanding enough? \n\nAdditional info: my best friend (31) is male born and presenting, but identifies as non binary. They’re also asexual. we have been friends longer then I’ve known my bf. Our friendships is strongly based on us supporting each other through the losses of our parents. (Theirs two years ago and mine last year) there has never been a sexual aspect of our friendship. We’ve never engaged in sex or made out. We have slept next to each other fully clothed when we’ve spent the night at each others houses. When we hang out we do normal stuff study just watch funny videos and chat. I cut and dye their hair but that’s about the extent of our physical contact. \n\nMy bf says he just doesn’t understand our friendship because, well, he said because he doesn’t understand how two people with different genitals can have such a close relationship and NOT HAVE SEX. I made a comment one time that if his best friend was a woman, I wouldn’t care as long as she respected the boundaries of OUR relationship. He replied that if he had one, he would be with her. I’m trying to put my bf first and show him that he can trust me because I haven’t done anything but it’s always one step forward two steps back. I feel like a shell of my former self. I’m a bad worker. A bad student. A bad friend. a bad girlfriend. I need to figure out who is in the wrong so I can begin to start to fix it. \n\nTLDR;;; my(25nb) bf (37) has a lot of insecurities that affect our relations. My friendship with a male born person being the main one. Am I in the wrong or is he being unreasonable?",

Every night when she cries she beats herself up and talks down to me like I’m not understanding her “problems” and says stuff like I don’t love her, or that I just think that I do. It seems like she gets into moods with me over anything, whether it’s in school and I sit next to another girl becuase of the seating the plan or even how I look at someone when they talk to me, it’s ridiculous and I find myself constantly apologising. But recently arguments are starting to occur, she brings up things that happened ages ago to have ago at me for, for example she was away last Halloween so I went with my cousin who is like my sister to a matching costume party, and matched with her, it’s march and she brings it up how she felt sad and disgusted that I matched costumes with another girl, as in my cousin ! Which is ridiculous and i try and explain to her that I matched with my cousin to a party but didn’t listen and blamed it on her being sad and upset, and also mentioned she didn’t like my tone, so again I apologised for that, it’s so stupid. I don’t want her to ruin any relationship I have with my family, because she’s sort of distanced me from all my boys. So I don’t know what to do because is all this a good enough reason to break up with her for I just don’t know what to do with this relationship anymore.\n\nTL;DR : I really need help on how to handle my girlfriend so far I’m still with her I just need other people opinions.",

He’s brought her around 3 times.\n\nI’d like to get to know her but every time we hangout, they only talk to each other. I’ve made multiple efforts to get to know her but she seems cold and uninterested in me, my group of friends and girlfriend. A few examples:\n\n- we went to my friends birthday dinner and they sat in the middle but just spoke to each other the whole time. During one part of the meal, my friend (who she hadn’t exchanged words with yet) asked her what she did for a living. When he said he worked in fintech, she said “that’s a lot of big words”\n- my girlfriend tried to hug her the second time they met but my friend and I hugged first and were blocking them so she told my girlfriend” it’s okay, we don’t need to do that”. Keep in mind, I’m her boyfriends best friend. We hugged for like five seconds. They barely spoke the first time they met\n- we did karaoke and she sat in the corner and did not participate nor talk to anyone but my friend \n- not related to her hanging out, but my friend apparently pays for everything and she told him “I’ll start paying when I get a job”\n\nAnyway, this is a really good friend of mine but his girlfriend seriously brings down the positive energy when she’s around by coming across as cold and not contributing. Is she being rude or is it just me? Should I say something to my friend?\n\nTLDR: my friends girlfriend seems rude and isn’t contributing. Should I say something?",

        "text": "Hi! I’m sorry for the burner account. My (M18) and my girlfriend (F18) have been dating for about a year and 4 months. I love her very very much, she means the world to me and I try to let her know. My PTSD and paranoia leads me to be anxious and question her on her feelings (a lot of “I’m sorry I made you upset” when nothing is wrong.) I do trust her, and I’m trying not to put my paranoia on her as much, and am going into therapy as soon as possible. Sometimes this makes her distant, which I can understand. Despite my anxieties, I have never once questioned her loyalty. My girlfriend is bisexual (As am I) for future context. Yesterday, while printing photos, I found that she had multiple pictures of a girl’s butt saved. I had never gone through her phone before. I first saw one, and then I snooped. There were at least 10 different photos and videos of this poor girl taken without her knowledge. All fully clothed, but there. My heart sank. I did the stupidest thing I could have done and deleted them, but I don’t think she’s noticed yet. I know she struggles with a porn addiction, but this feels different. What do I do? How do I confront her when it’s my fault I looked further? What about the girl? I feel sick.\n\nTLDR; My (M18) girlfriend (F18) of over a year took 10+ pictures of a girl’s ass and saved them. What do I do next?",

Need advice moving forward.\n\nI (27F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for 4 years. 2 days before he had a car accident 6 months ago, I found out that he had cheated on me in the first year of our relationship. He confessed to everything  I had initially been suspicious of that he previously denied and gaslit me about and I told him I needed time to think. 2 days later he got into a really bad accident, and is now permanently disabled. Even though he hurt me, I loved him and didn’t want to abandon him in his time of need because I just couldn’t live with myself if I did, and I was too in shock to think clearly. It’s now 6 months later and I am just now realizing the actual amount of responsibility that I would have to have in caring for him long term — I would have to be his nurse. We couldn’t have children. We can’t even currently do anything we used to do, or enjoy anything we used to enjoy because of his newfound cognitive and mental health issues. He would have to be my whole life and nothing else, and I just can’t do it. Especially not for someone who cheated on me and lied about it for so long. If it hadn’t been for the accident, I most likely would’ve ended it that weekend. \n\nHe has tried to be very sweet to me, and tells me every day how much he loves me. That I am his rock, his reason for living, and I can’t stand it. He doesn’t have any friends in the city, not many in general, and spends most days alone aside from his parents currently caring for him. The odds of him ever finding another partner are very slim, so if I leave it means he will most likely end up alone.\n\nThe guilt is eating me alive. I don’t know what to do. We have known each other for 10 years and were best friends prior to dating. He knows that the only thing I’ve ever wanted was to be a mom and have a normal family and normal life. I just wished he loved me enough to let me go and not make me be the bad guy for not sacrificing the only thing that has given me a will to live. But he never will. 3 years of our relationship were built on a lie. Being with him since that week has made me fall into a deep depression and has given me frequent “unaliving” thoughts. I don’t hate him. I still love him. It’s just killing me. I don’t know what to do or say. Advice would be appreciated.\n\n\nTLDR; My boyfriend cheated and got into a disabling accident, I didn’t break it off when I should have out of guilt but now feel more guilty and depressed. How do I deal with this?",

I feel so bad that I’m giving myself stress migraines. All I wanna do is hurt myself. I want to end this pain. All day every day it’s the same. I can’t stop thinking about how much I’ve hurt her. I can’t move on. I’m stuck in that place where I’m disgusted by myself and I hate myself. I am so horrible and I deserve every second of this. There is no sympathy for me.

        "text": "I (F17) am worried my gf’s (F16) ex (M18) proposes to her\n\nFor context: we’re a lesbian couple living in a very conservative country in the middle eastern region. Let’s call my gf, Sara, and her ex bf, Tyler, for the sake of anonymity. \n\nSara was in an almost one and a half year, constantly on and off, relationship with Tyler. It started when she was 14 and he was 17. Already an unbalanced dynamic. Their relationship was an admittedly very toxic one, from Sara’s point of view at least. I think Tyler would agree as well. Tyler was both mentally and physically abusive. Every time Sara told me anything that occurred within their relationship I’d feel sick to my stomach. The things he did ranged from following her around when she didn’t want him to by getting access to her location, admitted to stalking her through her webcams and hacking into some of her devices, and just all around physical abuse disguised as play fighting. I’m really simplifying how seriously fucked their relationship was. Their relationship is not the point here, though.\n\nThe details of their relationship timeline are a bit hazy to me, at some point after their initial break up they were going out but still not together. In fact, that was most of their relationship. This continued until Tyler left for university away from home. It didn’t end entirely, but Tyler treated her horribly and ignored her for days on end when they both still lived in the same city, so once he moved, their contact was minimal. \n\nThis is where I come in, I was one of Tyler’s good friends and also Sara’s friend, me and her are in the same school. I was never made aware of the way Tyler treated her until she told me after he left. Weeks later, I was also going through a breakup and me and her just sort of hit it off. We wanted to have a bit of fun at first but then both of us started developing actual feelings. (I know this seems like a rebound situation, but I promise it’s not. I’m confident in my feelings for her and so is she.) We started going out, we didn’t date right away of course. During us going out, Tyler obviously did not get the memo and would randomly pop in to send her random love paragraphs that she would reply to very dryly. This did not bother me, I was not threatened by him at the time. Some time later, he ended up coming back to town during winter break, this freaked her out because she was worried he’d pull some shit. He didn’t, up until a day or two before leaving, he texted her a long paragraph of what basically is an open-ended farewell. The “reply to this or don’t” type. This was at the point where we were getting very serious. So she asked me if I would be okay with her calling him, giving herself the closure she needs. She just wanted an explanation to everything he had done. So, I said yes.  I don’t remember everything clearly but the call ended up being 2 hours long. I’m going to quickly skip over the closure part because I genuinely don’t remember what happened there. All I know is there were four two-hour calls spread out over two months. Which seriously pissed me off. We were dating at that point. So I told her I don’t feel comfortable with them talking anymore and she ended everything. Apparently he wanted to be friends. Bummer. \n\nAnyways, every time she got off the calls with him she would tell me what the calls entailed, it was almost always the same. It was just him saying he was going to get her back. He is convinced this is similar to the side relationships they used to have when they were on and off. What she failed to mention however, and what was brought to my attention very recently, was that he was planning on getting engaged to her by going to her family. She didn’t mention this because she knew it would send me over the edge, and it did. This isn’t a total gun to her head situation. Her family wouldn’t sell her out. But he would, admittedly, make a very good candidate for their daughter, and if he mentions that he used to know her years ago, they would be more enthusiastic to get them together.  This has been eating at my mind for the past few days and I don’t know what to do. I’ve already been feeling very threatened by him the past few weeks considering, well, her living situation would a be a lot better with him than with me. They wouldn’t be in a gay relationship in a muslim country. They would be able to have kids. Her parents wouldn’t disown her for loving him. And now the fact that theres a slight chance he might propose to her, it feels like my entire world just shattered even though I know her answer is going to be no, I don’t know what he’s capable of pulling to coerce her into it. I’m sorry for adding so much detail into this post, there’s so much information and I can’t tell what’s important and what isn’t.\n\ntldr; my gf’s ex might propose to her when he comes back to our city and im scared bc her parents would love him and even though i know she loves me hes a better option for her future than i am",

        "text": "Yesterday I broke up with my girlfriend of 8 months. On paper we were perfect together. She was the nicest person you can possibly imagine: so kind to everyone, so sensitive, caring, and proactive, she seen the best in me and glowed when she would encourage and care for me. Same values and interests, decently educated and passionate about her work, great great family, everyone thought we were perfect together.. \n\nThe sticking points though were:She was pretty attractive - not my type but I'd find myself being very into her when we bring intimate. Though increasingly I came to be annoyed by the way she talked, her smell, little irregularities in how she lookedI never missed her, she was very proactive on planning dates and texting and wanted to spend every moment together. I OTOH wanted more space and would feel like her messages were nagging me, and would irk me.She loved my personality and laughed and engaged with what I liked. I appreciated how much she dug my sense of humor and passions so enjoyed sharing that with her. But it increasingly felt like the times I was having a good time was because I was affirmed for fully being me, not because I enjoyed her.I asked for more space, and she countered saying \"if the plan is to get married and live together, we can't ask for more space, we should be getting to integrate our lives MORE\".\n\n I feel that conversation, not wanting to waste any more of our time and the massive discrepancy of how we both feel was the straw that broke the camels back.She was devastated though very kind and uplifting when we broke up. Now the following day I wonder if I was naive to expect more out of a relationship. We both integrated in eachothers lives quite well, but it just didn't feel right I also have a really bad stomach flu and could be misappropriating how poorly I feel as a sign of regret.\n\nSo did I mess up? Would love to hear your thoughts ❤️\r\n\nTLDR: girlfriend very loving and works on paper, but broke up because something felt off the whole time. Was that immature?",

Also the other day my friends and I were planning to go to a concert and he was also suppose to come. And he ended up getting everyone tickets except for me. It was kinda also my friend’s fault too that they didn’t include me (which is a whole other story). But its just the fact that he was showing so much interest in me and all of a sudden he stopped and doesn’t give a damn about me. Which hurts me so bad cause I think about him all the time. He also talks about other girls in front of me.

        "text": "Me and my partner (both 32F) are trying to work things out in our relationship. We were together for 3 years when I broke up with her. There were a lot of issues that I won't dive too deep into, but despite me begging for help in the relationship for months, I never got it. I was extremely unhappy and became emotionally numb. I planned on breaking up with her for probably about 6 months but couldn't do it and ended up cheating instead I guess hoping it would be an easier way out. I don't feel good about it at all and it's the biggest regret I have in life. \n\nDespite all that, she still begged me to work things out. We do have a house together and even though I wanted to sell, she didn't and she begged me to work on things so she wouldn't lose \"this life.\" After about 8 months of being broken up but basically acting like we were still together, we tried to work on things, but she was distracted by someone else she met. She kissed someone while we weren't together and we ran into her one night after we decided to try and work on our relationship. My partner decided to use this other girl to make me jealous and would text her things like \"you're so beautiful\" or \"I can't wait to kiss you again\" while her and I were cuddling. She also lied about seeing her and talking to her but why lie if you're not doing anything wrong? Anyway this clearly ended up not working, so we called it. \n\nBack in December, she asked to work on things again and again I said no. Yet we still continued to do couple things like cuddle and kiss and all of that stuff. So I said maybe we should give it a try since things were going well. That's when she says she met someone else. This is where I start to feel really betrayed.\n\nWe had a rule that we couldn't bring people we were dating to the house out of respect for one another. Well not only did she break this rule, but she lied about it. She told me she was inviting a friend over to the house and of course I said yes, but she lied about how she knew her. Turns out they met on tinder and were pursuing a romantic relationship and despite me seeing them cuddling on the couch, she still insisted there was nothing going on. Turns out that was a lie. \n\nI told her she needed to figure out what she wants and she said she wants to work on things with me. I made it clear that it meant she couldn't be friends with this other person and she said she agreed and understood. However, she tried to create a loophole where since we weren't \"technically\" together, she could still be friends with her. After some couples therapy and individual therapy, I gave her a choice (and the therapists agree it's not control, but a choice): work on things with me and end that \"friendship\" or maintain that friendship and lose me. She chose the friend and yet here I still am. \n\nFor context, we were together 3 years and have been broken up for almost exactly a year, so we've known each other 4 years. She's known this other person 4 months. We've been working on things for a month and she admits that she still has feelings for her. Is it fair of me to set this boundary? \n\ntl;dr: my girlfriend and I are trying to repair our very broken relationship. Before we did, she met someone and developed feelings for her. She previously agreed to drop the friendship if we were going to work on things. It's been a month and she hasn't dropped the friendship and now refuses to do so and she still has feelings for this other person. Is it fair of me to make her choose between me and this other \"friend\"?",

        "text": "My husband (40M) and I (35F) have been together for almost 15 years. We have 3 amazing children together, a beautiful home and great jobs. But I need to know, am I the asshole?\n\nTo preface what I’m about to describe: I have a great deal of difficulty sleeping. I often have a tough time falling asleep and staying asleep. Not to mention if any of the kids need anything, it’s me they come to in the middle of the night. With daylight savings time, I was feeling especially exhausted the other night.  My husband suffers from sleep apnea and uses a CPAP at night, which between the snoring and the sound of the machine, I have had to adjust and work very hard to ignore those sounds just to fall asleep. My sleep issues are not news to him either. \n\nAnyway, the other night we go to bed. He’s out like a light minutes after his head hits the pillow. And then his phone starts going off. It’s a group chat composed of his work buddies. It’s also after 10pm. He doesn’t hear it/ acknowledge it. It keeps dinging and dinging and dinging with every reply. I ask him nicely “hun, turn your phone on silent.” “Babe! Turn off your phone!” And then my patience ran out, “TURN OFF YOUR F*CKING PHONE!” He mumbled something like “calm down” and then I said “tell your mistress your wife is trying to sleep” \n\nWell, that was it. “Why do you have to be such an asshole?” \n\nFor context, I truly believe in my heart of hearts that my husband is not cheating nor would he ever.  \n\nAnyway, after he got all pissy, I just went out to the couch. I was honestly thinking he was asleep and just wanted to stay that way, and I was seeking a good nights slumber as well. \n\nWe got home and from work the next night and he’s giving me the silent treatment. I asked him about work, “how was the gym?” I was met with one word answers. I know he’s mad but dot. Know what about. Then he brings it up. “You were such a jerk last night about the phone. I don’t want to keep my phone on silent because what if my dad…” (his dad is elderly and is in poor health). I get it, but I leave my phone on silent at night.  I told him that I thought it was disrespectful that he couldn’t turn the sound off for one night. He thinks I’m unreasonable because in our 15 years together, this is the first time it was an issue. I explained that this was the first time his phone blew up late at night that disrupted my ability to fall asleep. He said I always make him out to be the bad guy, and I pointed out that had he not said anything, it wouldn’t have been an issue anymore. \n\nTLDR: AITH for getting cranky my husband’s notifications for his work group chat annoyed me and prevented me from sleeping late at night?",

We didn’t have sex as she was on her period but we did other stuff. We met up with my mates in the morning and got food before she headed home.\n\nI then was gonna go out the next night too but ended up being too tired. Two of my mates went though, including one who went the previous night. He’s one of my closest friends and I’ve known him for years. I went to bed after they headed out. He came back around 4am and woke me up to tell me he’d made out with the girl I was with the night before, and also that my other mate (22M) went home and slept with my ex (22F). He then didn’t even apologise or anything and just went to bed on my sofa.\n\nI know she has no obligation to not do that and nor does he but it just felt a little off. He kisses multiple people a night usually and this was my first time taking someone home in like 9 months. The girl talked about wanting me to go out that night before she left earlier in the day, and then my mate got with her instead. I don’t know whether I should be or have the right to be upset with my mate though.\n\nI’m also there again tomorrow night and I know she’ll be out so I’m not entirely sure what to say if she comes up to me again. Any advice is much appreciated, thanks.\n\nTL;DR: my mate made out with the girl I took home the night after. I hadn’t taken anyone home in months but he usually kissed multiple girls a night.",

        "text": "2 18 year old bisexual girls\n\nThere’s this girl I dated literally 2 months ago. We dated for a month but we’re really close friends for a few months beforehand. She had a crush on me and purposely put so much effort into getting with me. It was through her that I found myself crushing right back and learned I’m into girls too! (Keep in mind, she knew she liked girls for 2-3 yrs prior and I just found out) We confessed to each other at one point. It was the most amazing relationship I’ve ever had, and it was the first time either of us had dated a girl. All our friends were so happy for us. I told my family and they were happy too. \n\nBut she was having sexuality insecurities and was scared to tell her parents, as amazing as they are. After all her effort, she broke up with me bcs she said she “didn’t expect her plan to actually work out” and “realized she couldn’t handle dating a girl yet.” It broke my heart because she started all of it just to let her commitment issues get the best of her. \n\nWe tried to be “friends” for a month, during which she did so many confusing things, like drunk texted me saying she missed me, wore my sweater to school, literally cuddled in the back of my car at night with me on my birthday, and was being incredibly hot and cold with me, and this is bcs I knew we still had very strong feelings for each other. Like I kid you not, there were no problems in the relationship she just wasn’t willing to face the world with me and she was lowkey embarrassed to be with me bcs of her popular friend group. \n\nThis kept going until she ghosted me one day. Then I found out the week she ghosted me she also started talking more to my bff(who is also gay) that I introduced her to in order to help her build a community of girls who like girls that she can talk to, and learning this hurt me your absolute fucking most . Now they’re friends and even though she told me she wanted to cut me out of her life and forget the feelings, she’s making it impossible for me to do the same and it’s incredibly unfair of her. \n\nThe last two months I’ve been an absolute mess bcs of her and I feel manipulated and betrayed and so hurt still(especially bcs she knew I had trust and abandonment issues and still did all this). Worst part is I still have feelings for her, and as mad as I am at her I still want her in my life bcs we are literally the same person and she understands me more than anyone. \n\nAnyways she wants to have an in person talk with me now, and I want to know if it’s okay for me to still feel so hurt and have feelings for her even after 2 months? Is it okay for me to hate that she’s friends with my bff now bcs of me? And generally what’s your input on this situation?\n\nTL;DR!\nA girl who knew she was bi did everything she could to get with me and it worked, and I learned I’m bi too in the process. The relationship was great, until she let her commitment issues get the best of her and bailed on me when she got insecure and confused by her sexuality. It hurt me really really bad, bcs she knew I have severe trust and abandonment issues, and now 2 months have passed and I’m still hurt and she still misses me. I’m not sure if how angry and sad I feel is valid or not and what I should do?",

        "text": "My Mom and I have a good relationship about 90% of the time. We probably fall into that Gilmore Girls-esque category which I realize isn't the healthiest but, I've always had therapy going to temper it.\n\nRecently though the arguments have gotten more explosive, screaming matches that end with tears- usually mine. Words said that we both can't take back. I have no idea who is in the wrong and who is in the right anymore. The thing is, I do not have much family or friends to discuss this with I have my therapist, but we've been working on panic attacks related to my boyfriends and aunt's death that happened within a year of each other.\n\nI have wanted to bring it up in therapy but honestly, I don't know if it's worth mentioning or if I am in denial. There have also always been bigger more pressing issues to discuss in the limited hour that is therapy too.\n\nWhere to start- my Mom is a good Mom. She has afforded me experiences that many people don't have. Fine dining, Vacations abroad, theme parks were all experienced at various times in my childhood. She was a single Mom who got barley any support from my Dad (he lied to make child support payments $300 a month, He's a doctor). I know she tried which is what makes this so hard.\n\nThings weren't always great though. When I was 10 we moved from the US to the UK I met my step-father for the first time getting off the plane and everything slid from there. My grandmother passed away that same year, My grandfather started abusing me, My Mom was diagnosed with cancer shortly after. She had a cardiac arrest, attempted to unalive herself, My step-father came to get me- the then 11 year old to \"deal with it\". After that they divorced.\n\nOur money situation got very tight after that. We were secure before, after a divorce and immigration to a different country though a lot of the nest egg was depleted. We had to get rid of my childhood dogs- that was painful but we couldn't afford it. We made sure they went to good homes. It wasn't long before she met my second step-father, who is and was the anti-christ. She met him when I was like 14 and he was genuinely a narcissist. That's when our relationship changed.\n\nI try to have compassion because I know how that relationship literally sucked the life from her. But, I also wish that she left earlier. It was a pattern, He would pick a fight with her Friday, we'd go out for the weekend, he would be online liking 300+ profiles of other women (no joke genuinely that much). Then he would be begging for her to forgive him Monday to rinse repeat.\n\nThe whole time they were together, which was 4-5 years, she was \"his wife\" not my mother. Something he said. If i needed help with school work, tough shit. I spent 100% of my free time in my room because he would make fun of my self harm, then make fun of me not smiling, being depressed. He was worse to her though. Calling her a stupid cow, cheating on her with so many women, two were \"regulars. It finally cumulated. In him being removed from the home by police.\n\nTrying to get away was hell too he would pop up everywhere and worst of all she was hooked on \"the game\". 2am \"recon\" missions to spy on him to see if he was lying (of course he was) were staple all though my GCSE's my school work tanked, I got signed out with a back issue too so just yet another thing.\n\nShe got progressively more depressed This, was not my mom, this was someone else. I got worried she would hurt herself, but I never said anything to my therapists because I didn't want to go to my Dad, he ignored me all through childhood and when he didn't he literally held me to impossible standards. I literally grew up crying over spilt milk.\n\nWe finally managed to get away from my step-father permanently when i was 18/19. Her depression got worse. She used my bank account to commit a white collar crime. I stayed because I knew this wasn't her. she hadn't ever had so much as a parking ticket before. I luckily wasn't charged as she confessed to everything. I stood by and asserted this must be a cry for help to police, they understood. I flunked out of A-levels and never managed to get into college or further myself. I had a relationship that also was abusive, he would stonewall me and that became my whole world. I made wrong choices, she did too.\n\nI did well with jobs until I was 23- then I had panic attacks. I couldn't work. We moved back to the US to take care of a relative, I fell in love, he died unexpectedly and then within a year my aunt died too.\n\nIf you are still with me I am sorry this is scattered it's a lot to try and get out. My Mom has financially supported me for these 3-4 years I haven't been working, My aunt required 24/7 caretaking so I've done that. Now I'm applying for jobs. My mom and I just argue a lot. I don't know what to think anymore. She has supported me but sometimes she will say things that cut so deep, like when my boyfriend died and I was not even a week out I had a melt down that I would never find anyone with that connection ever again and she told me I was making his death about me. That I should feel more sorry for his mother. I did, but I was hurting too. She also throws it up in my face that I haven't been working every time we argue, but again, I couldn't caretaking literally 24/7. My aunt had lewy body dementia and couldn't be left alone. she would try to escape the house. My mom was working so I was left to watch her. Equally my Mom complains that I never let her forget what she did, and that is true, I have tried to get past it but it is really hard. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel betrayed. That really doesn't mean I don't love her though. I also think she never would have done that without the influence of that asshole.\n\nTLDR; We haven't been getting on since her last relationship with my second step-father what can I do to improve the situation?\n\nWhat do I do? She's my mom and I love her deeply, but I get this sinking feeling sometimes that things aren't quite right. I need an outside perspective on this am I being stupid?",

        "text": "In the course of less than a week, I've lost two close people in my life who I hang out with regularly. One of them, my cousin (29F), got mad at me on Tuesday and cut me out for doing something I didn't think was wrong or a big deal (you can look through my old posts to see more details), and yesterday another close friend (32M) texted me after we hung out saying that he thinks it would be best if we spent time apart. I think in his case, he had a thing for me, and I said something while hanging out with him that made him realize I wasn't interested and wouldn't ever want to date him. In my cousin's case, she went ballistic and started texting me very toxic things and ran a smear campaign to my entire family, calling me a sociopath and \"sneaky\", even though I am very much neither of those things. I actually have OCD and struggle with guilt in situations where I haven't done anything wrong.\n\nA few months ago I ended a 3-year long relationship with a mega-extrovert who had a huge group of friends, so I was around people all the time. I considered myself to be part of that group, and realized only when we broke up that none of them were actually my friends, as no one reached out, checked up on me, and actively ignored invites I would send them to get together. Now, he's back with his old ex from college, and she's pretty much replacing me in that group. I should mention that I met my aforementioned friend through him, as he's friends with my ex too, and he was one of the only people that was actually\n\nThe only close friends I have of my own are my other cousin (28F) and another friend that I've been friends with for years. I also have some friends that don't live in my city, that I'm in a virtual book club with. But I don't have\n\nI don't mind losing friends for the right reasons, but I'm just starting to get worried and feel like I'm destined to be lonely. I enjoy spending time by myself and I like myself, but I'm worried that at 27 (going to be 28 next week), it's too late for me to make good friends. I'm single, I don't have kids, and I work from home. I try to get out, but now that the two people I would go out with frequently are out of my life, I'm worried that I'm not going to get a lot of opportunities to meet new people. I'm okay with going places by myself, but I struggle with social anxiety, and making new friends isn't always easy for me, especially if I'm not meeting them through other friends.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? What did you do/how were you able to make friends? My life just took a very drastic change from having lots of \"friends\" (if you want to call them that) to none at all. I'm an introvert, but I'm starting to get really depressed, even if the friends I lost weren't good for me. The other two close people in my life have their own things going on, they're both in relationships and one of them has a baby on the way. I'm a pretty self-aware person and people seem to have fun around me, I'm polite, I don't cause drama. I've had worse mental health issues in the past, but I worked with a therapist, and especially over the past couple of months feel like I've reached a point where I'm completely at peace with myself and who I am. I just don't want to be lonely :(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I'm in my late twenties and seem to be losing a lot of my close relationships. I want advice on how to make friends.",
