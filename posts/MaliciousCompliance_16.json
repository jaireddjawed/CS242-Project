        "text": " \n\nIn Training: A brief story of our shitshow from day 1\n\nOur training coordinators just consisted of the first three regular CSRs that got a lead position, all fresh to the role, because they were the first to jump ship to our company when the contract got bought, a solid month before we actually took over. These three were horrible at their job and could barely describe what to do for General Information, let alone the more specialized Family Medical and Elderly/Disabled callers, which we are all supposed to be trained for as we only handled General Information, ie the people who transfer calls and answer the utmost basic questions for people who can't read the website, for about 1-3 months. Each 'Lead' took turns going over the same information, but did not coordinate with each other, which meant for our generous 4 weeks of training we spent the first 4 hours of each day covering what we were told yesterday while following the next 4 hours with team building games, and practice calls where two of us, the fresh hires with no knowledge, applied the 4 hours of bullshit we zoned out on. Thankfully with all done via Teams and let us zone out a bit before going into the office. After 4 weeks of this, we basically were taught the protocol for logging into our accounts, accessing the Virtual Machine, how to click a button that literally says TRANSFER/HOLD/END, and how to say our 4 sentences long opening greeting \"Thank you for calling the Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment Center. We are with COMPANY NAME. My name is DaddySmallJohn and I will be your Representative for this call. May I inquire on how I can assist you today?\". Our Team Supervisor only took his job after training was complete, meaning he didn't even work here until a month after we started, and had never done any Medicaid-related work before, his first instruction to us was \"You may never end a call before the consumer allows you to, You will not escalate a call for any reason.\".",

Manager had never worked in a coffee shop before and fucked it up in numerous ways, but this one was my favourite.\n\nJohn was really inefficient. Example, he liked to make one coffee at a time no matter how many orders were on the screen. It makes a lot more sense to get all the espresso shots running, then steam a load of milk at once - it's just significantly faster. But whatever John, you do you.\n\nHe also liked to grandiosely talk at his teenage employees, explaining the nuances of running a business. On this day he was crapping on about the intricacies of scheduling (we had 4 employees, it wasn't that hard) during a fairly slow period. I was making a coffee, he was taking orders and grilling a sandwich someone had ordered.\n\nI noticed smoke coming out of the toaster machine that was directly behind him.\n\nMe: John, the sandwic--\nJohn: and another scheduling issue is, you guys-\nMe: John, the toaster-\nJohn: you guys don't understand the difficulty-\nMe: ...the toaster is-\nJohn: OP! It's really hard when you guys plan time off, I have to find replacements...\n\nThere was smoke coming out of the machine direvtly behind him. I sighed. And nodded along. About ten seconds later a customer yells out that the toaster is spewing smoke and John notices. Grabs it out with the tongs but manages to burn himself on this blackened, smoking panini. Smoke alarm goes off. I keep making coffee while he deals with the chaos.\n\nWhatever, John.\n\nBTW, the store that had been there for about 10 years went bust about a year after he took ownership.

        "text": "My company decided to implement 3rd party software to track employee productivity, and they started this BS way before the pandemic and remote work. \n\nAll technology teams were being monitored, and I worked on a product team under technology. The main metric they used was how much new code was being written, which is silly because even programmers don't write new code very often. Updated code didn't count and those were most of the tickets I managed and meanwhile, I was always fixing other people's code and I was the go-to person for any escalations and releases.\n\nWhen this first started, I saw a dozen emails about writing more code and I thought it was a joke until I got an unscheduled meeting with the department head. He scolded me for having written zero code that month and despite pushing that my role doesn't exactly require me to write new code, he said \"sorry, this is the new world.\" Exact words lol. \n\nFine, I found some old code libraries that no one used anymore but were still active. Every month, I would copy the libraries, delete them, and then replace them. I tested it out and that counted as new code. Before all this, I was a top performer up for promotion, but my reviews from before didn't count anymore and all that mattered were these metrics. I tried to keep my shenanigans under the radar but one month, I did the delete &amp; replace move twice because I forgot if I did my monthly coding quota, and did it again just in case. Well, that quarter I won an award for \"most prolific engineer\" and it came with $2k. \n\nThat got the attention of my manager, who was luckily a cool guy and openly complained about how stupid the productivity tracking software was. He knew I wasn't writing code, and neither was he, so I finally told him my secret. He actually thought it was hilarious and he himself had been just deleting/replacing lines of code to bypass the quota, but he didn't think about doing entire libraries. I knew I wouldn't get in trouble with him and he even nominated me for a recognition award, which came with another $1k in gift cards. \n\nI did eventually get promoted, over 6 months later than initially discussed, but things got even worse with the company monitoring productivity during the pandemic. It was so bad to the point where they were logging how many times you were away from your computer for more than 5 minutes! People actually got fired for taking too many \"breaks\" between 9am to 5pm. Let's just say I was taking my laptop everywhere out of paranoia. It didn't increase productivity, but it for sure killed morale. \n\nThankfully, I got the hell out of there. The rest of my team was not so lucky, but I still get texts from my old manager and team about how they're using my shenanigans. Ultimately, I got a nice $3k in awards, $15k from the promotion, and a lifetime of drinks from my team for beating the system.",

        "text": "A little bit of context: I work in a manufacturing plant for a multinational company producing microchips. I am the shift lead engineer on night shift for the front end of the week (Sunday - Wednesday) so there is very little oversight from management except when I see them in the morning on my way out the door. The machines we work on are huge (think greyhound bus size) and require fairly strategic planning to get the most we can out of them. \n\nIn recent months the day shift team has been slacking on their scheduled maintenance items. Normally this isn‚Äôt a big deal since we are understaffed just like just about every other company in America right now and we pick up the slack where we can on night shift. The machines run 24 hours a day so if you have to pass work to the incoming shift it isn‚Äôt an issue and everyone tends to help out everyone. The problem comes in when day shift or the other end of the week move scheduled maintenance off of their shift but don‚Äôt move it in our scheduled work calendar. When the machines reach their critical threshold they shut themselves down until the work is performed. This is normally at midnight on days I‚Äôm working. Well as it happens this has been occurring more and more over the past few weeks and I‚Äôve been letting my senior manager know that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve been seeing an availability drop on our not from lack of effort. He is a newer senior manager so I tried to explain the critical thresholds to him and how we need to at least keep the calendar accurate so we don‚Äôt have any surprises by machines shutting themselves down unexpectedly. He didn‚Äôt really seem to want to listen to this and brushed me off telling me ‚ÄúIf it isn‚Äôt on the calendar, don‚Äôt work on that machine‚Äù\n\nCue malicious compliance. On Sunday night when I get into work the schedule is completely empty (not uncommon for weekends) but wouldn‚Äôt you know it 3 maintenance items had been moved from the back end of the week and were never rescheduled. So at midnight 3 machines shut themselves down for maintenance, but I‚Äôve been told if it isn‚Äôt on the calendar I can‚Äôt touch those machines. I walk up to the production floor and tell all my technicians that we won‚Äôt be working on any of those machines as they aren‚Äôt scheduled for us to complete and per the area senior manager we don‚Äôt touch anything unless it‚Äôs on the calendar. They‚Äôve been getting more and more frustrated recently with this so their eyes light up as I tell them we won‚Äôt be completing any of the work. \n\nThen comes Monday morning. I tell the incoming shift and my direct manager about the machines and they have a good laugh about the situation. (It‚Äôs only roughly 2 hours of work per machine so I didn‚Äôt completely screw over day shift). And then I run into my senior manager on my way out the door and casually let him know we have 3 machines that have been down for 6 hours and need to be added to the schedule so somebody can start working on them. His eyes just about pop out of his head and he says ‚Äúhow could you let 3 machines sit down for half the night and not even start on them, were there other machines down that stopped you from getting to them?!‚Äù And I responded with ‚Äúnope, you just told me if it isn‚Äôt on the calendar don‚Äôt touch it‚Äù. His face went beet red and I saw the vein on his temple start throbbing, but he knew I was right. \n\nSince then the calendar has been pretty dang accurate and I if I see a tool going critical he‚Äôs now informed me that I‚Äôm allowed to work on it to keep the product flowing",

Micro manager who controlled every aspect of our work, constantly berated us for doing things wrong and making us re-do, even though she personally reviewed and approved everything.  She dismissed temps, even temps who been with us a year or more, by waiting until they left for the day, then calling the employment agency to say the temp was never allowed in the building again, not even to collect personal items they left at their desks.  Every temp, every time.  She inevitably set up every member of her 10 person department to fail in a big way so she could publicly berate us in front of our co-workers and then be angry and treat us like crap for months.  Yeah, lovely woman.  Pay and benefits were good, company was govt funded and stable, so I rode out the recession there.  Co-workers company wide were surprised she hadn't set me up yet for my big fail and often warned me it was inevitable.  In month 27 she started to set me up.  I had a very busy full time job there, she decided I would do accounting for the new construction project, then a second construction project.  The Construction Accountant could handle 2 projects as a full time job, so yeah, she was assigning me a 2nd full time job, no overtime allowed.  She refused to explain my responsibilities to me, and instructed the Construction Accountant to not answer my questions too. She was enjoying a long slow set up, was close to taking me down.  Then, at the end of month 29 I quit with 4 days notice (after the way she treated temps, why not!).  \n\nShe always kicked out quitters half way through their final day, not me.  She kept me there to the bitter end.  And had to endure co-workers coming to my office, right next to hers, to give me enthusiastic congrats and hugs while she glared daggers at me.  2 minutes before quitting time, she summoned me to her office. She was sitting behind her desk, elbow propped on the desk and hand high in the air, clutching my final paycheck.  And she said she had a few things to say to me.  She began to berate me for not doing some construction related task, I pointed out I asked her to tell me my responsibilities on many occasions and she refused to answer my questions.  She was waiting for this, tapped her computer keyboard, and in a loud and aggressive tone told me she had notes and on such and such a date she told me...  I glanced at my watch and interrupted her in a calm firm tone to say \"It's 5:30, is that my final paycheck?\"  She continued to berate me, gaining steam and volume.  I immediately interrupted her again and said \"It's 5:30, are you refusing to give me my final paycheck?\"  She sighed, pursed her lips and handed me my check as she told me that she had treated me very well and I wasn't a very good employee.  I said \"We'll have to disagree on that\" and walked away. She spent 3 long months setting me up, never got to take me down, never got to berate me, and had to concede to me in our final few seconds together.",

        "text": "When we started going back to the office during the last few months of Covid, people were very careful about touching commonly touched objects, such as stair rails and door handles, mostly because they were cautious about germs but also kinda scared of getting covid that way. \n\nThe men's bathroom's trash can was placed next to a wall, between the sinks and the door. This way, you would throw out your wet paper towel and then go over to the door and leave. This meant you had to use your bare hands to open the door. \n\nSomeone (never knew who) got the idea of moving the trash can right next to the door, so that you could open it with the paper towel still in your hand and then throw it out as you leave. This was great, because you no longer had to open the door with your bare hands, and people felt safer that way. The only problem was that it was a bit in the way. You had to move an inch or two to the left to not walk into it, which was not a problem because the door and the hallway were pretty wide anyway.\n\nThe office safety people found out about this after a few weeks, moved it back, and put up a sign asking not to move the trash can because it \"blocked the door\". Cue the malicious compliance.\n\nNobody moved it back to the door, but people were still not willing to open the door with their bare hands. So they continued using the paper towels to open the door, and threw them across the hallway, into the trash can as they walked out. Most people were good at landing the towels in the trash can, but some were not. It was not long before the paper towels started piling up around the trash can. It never got too bad, but it looked messy and dirty. Naturally, it took very little time before people started complaining about it. \n\nThe office safety people ended up buying a smaller trash can that was attached to the wall, right next to the door. To this day most people use the paper towels to open the door and the bathroom is no longer messy, so everyone won!",

So to make use of it, we planted some chillies, tomatoes and shit. And the front of the property had nothing growing on it so dad decided to fence it up and use it as a parking spot. \n\nNext day, in the morning me and dad had a casual banter and he was angry at me for something not so serious. Afternoon I see some people working on the property and installing a gate. I go there, so what they did was , they fenced like 12-13 ft from right side and were installing gates on the left side. ( Property is 20/50). \n\nSo here is the catch, the gates were opening inside the property, and because all the plants the only place to park was that block where the car was supposed to be parked. And when the car is parked, there is no way we can close the gates. I quickly realised it and tried telling dad while laughing.\n\nMe: hahaha... How wrong can you be dad? \n\nDad: (still angry) stfu , i don't want your opinion.\n\nMe : but....\n\nDad : looks at me pissed. \n\nNow, I was trying to help but if you want me to shut up, I will. I go home, tell my mother everything just before they complete installing the gates... Mom laughs. Dad comes home to call my mother to see the parking spot, we go there and mom tells my dad son wants to tell you something . Dad asks me what? I tell him you won't be able to close gates after you park because reason. And swear to god his face and the faces of other two guys who were installing gates were precious.mom and I laughed so hard after that , and they had to redo all of that all embarrassed.\n\nNow every time he tells me to shut up,  i remind him what happened when he didn't listen to me.",

Especially, as in the case I‚Äôm about to describe, when we are purchasing from a private seller (not a established storefront - could even be a guy off Kijiji). \n\nSo one day I‚Äôm asked to email a new private seller about something our client is purchasing from him. I sent my standard email noting all the things we need from this private seller, let‚Äôs call him Bob. Bob called me shortly after receiving the email and was super slimy on the phone. He was being flirty and kept saying he wanted to meet for coffee and discuss me working for them instead - after one standard email. I got a bad feeling about this guy. Like he was trying to get away with something. So I made a mental note to really watch what he sent in. \n\nOver the course of the next few days, he sent in everything except what I asked for. He was getting ruder every time we spoke /emailed and was calling our client, telling them how we were the worst company he could have chosen to deal with. He said he has the right to not supply the info we‚Äôre looking for and of course, that‚Äôs true but that cancels the sale, which he didn‚Äôt want. \n\nSo one morning he finally sends me the document I was waiting for. Within his email to me, Bob made it very clear that we were ridiculous and this is the last thing he is providing us so don‚Äôt even bother asking. I opened it up and it was clearly fraudulent. Anyone at my office would have said the same thing and there is no way we were going to accept it. \n\nAfter discussing with my sales guy, I responded to the email and said ‚ÄúHi Bob. Thank you for sending this over, however as it‚Äôs been clearly edited in a fraudulent way we cannot accept it. You mentioned in your email that we shouldn‚Äôt ask for anything else, so I won‚Äôt. We have spoken to our mutual client and have agreed to cancel this transaction and won‚Äôt be speaking with you further. Have a great day!!‚Äù \n\nHe ended up calling both our mutual client and the sales guy in a panic, wanting to back track and get the sale done and would provide what we need. Obviously, we blacklisted this guy and never did business with him again.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit! This is my first time posting on this sub and English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance if I write something confusing. \n\nThis was a not a big of a deal but even after years I still find it funny.\n\nThis happened years back when I was working as an IT for a relatively large engineering company (around 5-6 branches in our place). It was a great workplace. This was a family owned business and since it was funded using the Father's (Let's call him Dick) money, he is given the VIP privilege, basically, everything he requests should be done without consideration, even if it fucks up the process, yadda yadda.\n\nEveryone in the office and most of the people on other sites (people get transferred to other sites for managerial positions or to fill up any vacant positions frequently) knows this and would constantly talk about him and his unrealistic \"demands\" like one-time he requested to have access to all user emails since he fears sabotage from resigning and terminated employees and want their login info to be sent to him on an excel sheet (this was declined, of course).\n\nDick is also known for being an alcoholic, drinking as early as 4 AM inside his office, and would lash out at anybody when drunk. The IT guys were the common target for his lashing out since it's unavoidable that employees experience issues with their devices and would tell us that \"This should not be happening, why are we even paying you for this\". \n\nI was on the middle of my 30-day notice when we received an email from Dick, asking for all Shared Emails to be delegated to him, aside from those to whom he already has access. All 12 of them. In case you're not familiar with Outlook, emails are stored locally in a file inside your device. More accounts you have access to =&gt; more storage space consumed. Even when there's a max storage space of 50GB for these files, you can alter the maximum up to 300GB but we never do this, well.. we did it once for him. \n\nOur team has gone to the lengths of convincing him not to do it since it would consume a fuckton amount of space on his device and we could delegate to him the emails he needs at the moment instead, then delegate some more later if a need arises. Basically saying his request is unnecessary but nah, he wants them now, he wants them fast, and he wants them stored inside since he wants to look at the emails \"Even without the internet on\". Since we realized there was no convincing D about the risks, Malicious Compliance knocked on the door, asked to be let in, and shat on the floor.\n\nAll shared folders were delegated to him, having around 20-30GBs of emails and attachments each. Configured to automatically download and be saved locally. \n\nThe next day we got a request to procure another laptop for Dick. Turns out while the emails were syncing, it got to a point where his storage was bottoming up, the device was starting to freeze a lot, and whenever he tries to delete other files just to make up available space, it would get replaced by the emails that are being synced in. He got so frustrated that he punched a hole on the screen.\n\nIts to say we were asked to revert what we did the day prior, and set up his new device. Very nice event before I left the company.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR = VIP asks for access to all shared mailboxes, punched a hole on his device due to it freezing.",

This isn't a lot for my degree program. But again I was comfortable. It's a bureaucracy so it would take a couple months they said to hire me full time and I will be on part-time until then.\n\nIt took them 6 months to send me a letter finally offering me a job full-time at a rate of $22 an hour.\n\nI called to ask and I was told that I should be coming out ahead and make about the same amount of money on full-time as I used to part-time because of benefits and medical Care.

I was told I should consider if the field was right for me.\n\nThat's not exactly an order but I definitely took it literally, within two weeks I had a job offer at $40 and in 3 weeks I was working for a new company with great people in a positive working environment and my old boss was left with a project that had effectively been gutted. I believe the value of the device is around $500,000, papers and reports will not be produced and until you can find someone to replace me it's a f****** paperweight.",

        "text": "Hey y'all! Little disclaimer: this is my first ever post on this site so I apologize if my formatting is a bit off, I'm not much of a writer, let alone a super-duper dramatic revenge plot one lol))\n\nEarlier last year, my family decided to throw me a surprise Sweet 16 birthday party which all of our extended family members were invited to. Among those invited, were my aunt, who we'll call Carol, who is known in our family to be super conservative, unlike her husband, who tends to be more open-minded than her (though to be quite frank the bar was on the floor). Since it was my Sweet 16, I decided to try out something new in regards to my appearance I've always wanted to do but never quite got the chance to ‚Äî that being shaving my head. Little note: my aunt has always admired and complimented my long hair, mostly due to the fact that it heavily resembled the way she wore her hair when she first met my uncle in the 70s, so you can only imagine the expression on her face when she saw me walk into the room with a buzzcut.\n\nAnd so, over the course of the party, while I got many weird looks from my more conservative family members, none were as fierce as my aunt's. She'd continuously make passive aggressive remarks in regards to my new hair, or rather lack there of. I tried my best to laugh them off, but with the things she was saying slowly getting a lot lighter on the passive part and a lot heavier on the aggressive bit, it kept getting harder to do so.\n\nWhen my birthday party eventually came to a close, as we were all saying our goodbyes, instead of bidding farewell like everyone else, Carol, now with her composure nowhere near in sight, starts berating both me and my parents for letting me shave my oh-so precious hair off, saying how \"a woman like me should never even as much as *hold* a razor anywhere near her hair!\" *Queue malicious compliance.*\n\nIt took me all my willpower not to lash back out at her, but I somehow managed to hold myself back. And in the middle of her yelling, it's like a light bulb lit up in my head. And so, taking her advice, I swore to not shave *any* of my body hair until at least the next time I saw her, which was not long since Thanksgiving was not too far away.\n\nAnd with that, the next 3-4 months, were not only a delight not having to worry about shaving, but also strangely cathartic. I did everything in my power to make my leg and arm hair grow faster. You could name any method for hair growth and I can guarantee I had tried it.\n\nWhen Thanksgiving finally rolled around the corner, I made sure to pick out some clothes that revealed most of my arms and legs to piss her off even more. As I came up to meet Carol, the expression that washed up on her face can only be described as an unholy mix of both disgusted and horrified. Before I could even get within 2 feet of her, she quickly rushed to the bathroom, with her hands over her mouth. After what seemed like an eternity of painfully fake retching sounds, she finally exited the bathroom and started loudly screaming at me about how I \"look like a man\" and how me \"letting myself go\" had literally made her sick to her stomach, also making sure to compare me to big hairy animals while she was at it. Slowly, a crowd had formed around us. Embarrassed by his wife, my uncle forcefully dragged Carol away by her hand and out the door, as everyone in the room froze up a bit. \n\nSince then, my uncle has profusely apologized to me and my aunt has insisted on not appearing at any family gatherings if I were there. And in the not-so off chance Cousin L happens to be reading this, I'm so sorry you have to have such shitty parents, girl. &lt;3",

This meant sometimes I'd be skipped because my customer orders came directly to me.  Ginger was after me in the assignment order and he would get mad if he got 2 in a row.  Each order took 2 or 3 minutes to process so getting an extra was no big deal.\n\nGinger was in a special mood one day and I got like 15 orders from my assigned customers.

Her and her husband both co-signed these loans so the daughter was being asked to pay back far more then she could afford initially. Eventually she managed to negotiate a $100.00 payment monthly‚Ä¶ she began to overpay by sending in a paper check (this is important later) for $500.00 every three months. However, she began to receive statements that said she had not paid the monthly premium including automatic late fees and having the account automatically being flagged as late (effecting her, her husband and daughter‚Äôs credit scores). \n\nAfter multiple phone calls regarding how she was actually paying the balance in advance, the rep stated that it doesn‚Äôt count because she wasn‚Äôt paying to the balance monthly and that the system would still flag it as late. She asked if the overpayment amount counted toward the $100.00 a month as long as the Bank received a payment every month and that as long as payment arrived each month she would not have late fees or have the account be flagged for late payments. She was told it did‚Ä¶ *Cue Malicious Compliance* \n\nShe began to send a $500.00 paper check every other month, in the off month she would send them a paper check for $10.00. For those unfamiliar with banking practices surrounding paper checks, they are considerably more expensive to process then automatic payments. This means they would be spending more money in other processing fees and employee time to process a $10.00 check every other month then the check was worth‚Ä¶ but it stopped the automatic late payment fees and stopped the account from being flagged for late payment. \n\nAfter several months of this, she received a letter from Bank with Horse and Carriage as the logo that stated that after analyzing the loan that it was too old (less than 10 years) and the balance (then around $25,000.00) would therefore be forgiven. \n\nShe has had no further calls or contact with Bank with Horse and Carriage as Logo since.",

        "text": "As many of Reddit Nation may know by now, I teach during my day job. What many *don't* know is what I do in the in-between, to make ends meet. I tutor at students' houses, and on occasion I pick up a couple of adjunct faculty teaching gigs at the neighboring community college. This story is about my experience at this Arizona community college, and marks my very first Malicious Compliance at this campus. \n\nRarely am I the recipient of some MC, but here we go.... \n\nSo I'm teaching a bunch of adults at the community college, but it honestly feels like teaching high school. Most of the people in this class, despite being college students, truly lack any of the mathematical foundations necessary to, well, even survive in normal adult life. That is why this class exists, and why  MAT092, Introductory Algebra, is offered to hundreds of students. I am one of six \"professors\" who teach this course. I put it in quotation marks because I feel like, despite having a degree in higher education, teaching this course doesn't earn me that term. Maybe I'm undervaluing myself... wouldn't be the first time. \n\nSo anyway, where were we? Struggling peeps, rambling teacher? Oh. Right.\n\n So after I assuage their Math Anxiety, I start introducing them to some real world scenarios that could be shown in slope-intercept form, like gym memberships with a one-time sign up fee, a lake that loses x amount of feet in depth consistently over time, etc. After I have students successfully identify the slope and intercepts of various situations, I then have them create some of their own scenarios. Now this is a college course, so regardless of the level of content, I need to establish some clear learning targets, objectives, and establish a clear rubric for my students to follow to allow for grading system with maximum clarity. I tell the students the components of the rubric, and explain that they need to have a slope and intercept with the situation they create. As I was grading them I couldn't help but notice one particular student who had their scenario of \"how many calories I'm supposed to eat every day\", with the equation written, however sloppily, y = 2000x\n\nI gave this student markdown for not having an intercept. The next time class occurs the student asks why I marked them down for the assignment. I told him he didn't have an intercept, so I marked it down. \n\nMathlicious Compliance has entered the classroom\n\nShe then hits me back with a \"I thought you said that with the equations there is *always* an intercept... even if that intercept is ZERO... right??\"\n\nI can't argue with that. No literally, I can't. She got full credit. \n\n Now I'm feeling like DJ Khaled... because in the long run, I just played myself.",

Guys on the production floor usually shut down their machines around 3:30, clean the station and go to showers and change into normal clothes to be ready to clock out at 4.\n\nRecently we got a new  factory manager from an HQ. Damn how he flipped when he found out people stop working 30 min early to clean their stations and change clothes. He called a big meeting and told us (middle guys) to tell people that 4pm time is not the time to leave but to stop working. Thinkging being smart he overlooked the rule that employees clock out ONLY when leaving the building (company rule for safety reasons). Basically, it means that the only unpaid thing in our work is smoking, because smoking is allowed only outside of the compound.\n\nPast three weeks people were turning off machines at 4pm and taking their sweet time to clean the workplace and hit showers, usually making 40-60 minutes of OTs per day. Today the new manager find out that over 100 people will have 20hr OTs and gotta dish out nearly 40,000 extra on salaries, while there is not enough production work to cover it because all the machine cleaning and showering was done past regular clocks and cannot be counted towards production, but as utility hours, which employees were generous enough before to fit them into regular hours thanks to filling daily goals bit early.\n\nThe new HQ hot shot now running around the compound trying to find how to justify why suddenly under his command the company need extra 2000 manhours when for over 10 years it never did.",

        "text": "English not first language som some words may be wrong, blah blah blah.\n\nI work in the administration of a fairly large county in Europe. My field is archives and the daily running of the administrations archives, but seeing as the county is in charge of running many schools in the area, we also have a responsibility for the archives in the schools. Now these archives will contain all kinds of information about students, staff, school etc. For large schools the archives can get rather big. \n\nAll the way back in 2010 there was a shift. A new archive system was brought in, and this was revolutionary as this was going to be fully electronic. No more paper to be packed in boxes and stuffed in shelves. In this process there were also discussions around if the administration was going to take over the archives of the schools and the running of those. The schools kinda paniced and dug their heels to the ground. It was very important that they owned the archives and kept owning them. Probably due to a fear of getting fewer resources over the next couple of budgets, but probably also some kind of fear of not having control over the archives. The response from the schools were such an overwhelmingly no that it was decided not to push through. Schools were to still own their own archives and also have full control of the new electronic archives, with the administration there as support and issuing general guidelines etc. \n\nNow some nerdy stuff you need to know about archives: There are a couple of complex and VERY detailed laws surrounding this stuff. First with regards to the archive rooms. Building a certified archive room is expensive as fuck. And it also messes with the general infrastructure of the building, as there can be no piping in the vicinity, ventilation have to be better than everywhere else to make sure mold doesn't happen etc. Also the archives need to be neatly ordered and there can be no paperclips or anything like that on the papers(staples are ok), no plastic folders, folders need to be of a certain paper and boxes as well so they don't damage the paper. Boxes also need to be of a certain shape and form etc. The law regarding this field also state that any material older than 20 years SHALL be placed to a depot with a proper archive room. Those of you that have any legal background know that if the law says \"shall\" you have no way to get around it. We have one certified depot in the county where we can hand off paper archives. No school has a certified archive room. \n\nNow you'd think that the schools would understand this and make their due diligence as they put things in the archive. Spoiler alert: they didn't. You'd also think they'd follow the laws and start handing off material that was older than 20 years. Spoiler alert: didn't do that either. \n\nSo onwards to today. Schools are feeling the pressure to hand off the old material because they need the space. Turns out very few have done any work on the material these last 10 years, and some of the archives goes back to the 40's or earlier. They either need to spend hundreds of hours cleaning up the archives themselves, or they need to pay a good fuckton of money to others to tidy it up for them. Also there are some that have been unlucky enough to get mold in their archives which need to be handled and that's expensive as fuck. \n\nThe costs could have been offloaded on the administration in 2010, but instead it was so important to keep the archives that they now have to pay millions to get everything sorted. \n\nNote: Most of those working out at the schools take this work seriously, it's just been a matter of resources for them. They do their best under the circumstances, they just have to suffer from stupid decisions made by their predecessors.",

We work about 50 hours a week presently so the numbers below are based on overtime wages. Our office is remote from the Corporate Headquarters and we are not near our remote locations.\n\nOne of our installations is within five minutes of the employee's home. Since I have complete control over space and time (well at least my *drivers'* time), I make sure we either pick up or deliver something  at this location around 12:00 noon so he can go home for lunch instead of spending minimum wage dollars on fast food (have you seen the prices lately?). The minimum wage thing is a whole other story.\n\nSince we started this process, we have both been going home a half an hour earlier since business has been kinda slow. Since the boss sees the weekly timesheets he knows what time we clock in and out. He's never mentioned the going-home-early labor savings.\n\nThe result of the boss's request is that now my driver doesn't get paid $1.38 for his travel time from our installation to his home (he would leave home for another delivery or pickup so there would be no travel time back to our installation). \n\nAlso we are now clocking out a half an hour later than we had been, costing the company over $8.00 a day for the driver, along with my wages for that extra half hour.\n\nI will update this if I hear anything back from HR or the boss.",

Its important for me to mention we are both first year students in the same university which is in a completely different country from our homes so we were kind of stuck together since we didn‚Äôt know anybody and haven‚Äôt explored the environment.I was very happy to take them under my roof and spend each day together but at some point it began to seem like i was of no interest to them . My presence, my touch , my voice , everything i did felt like some sort of sheer piece of cloth being gently thrown into the space of each room,it is there but it is barely noticed or let alone appreciated.I tried confronting them about it but they said im overreacting and that i am the one who is acting cold and distant which made me feel guilt since i only distanced myself because it seemed as if i was annoyed and a bad company.ive been trying to ignore the sadness and pretend to be fine with it but last week I couldn‚Äôt hold it anymore.I got a call from my family that my mother had passed away which destroyed me. I was in need of warmth and empathy and someone to be there for me , to show some genuine care and to share a part of my pain with.This was not the case.This happened on Friday which is an important detail to the story.After those news all i could do is cry and lay in bed.I was in no shape for going out or meeting people or doing pretty much anything but my partner told me they wanted to do something over the weekend like going to a bar or something of that nature but i declined as i explained my reasons.Apparently my obvious pain and the awful state i was in was not enough to make my partner feel any empathy nor care for me so instead of showing compassion and warmth they decided to get mad and stop talking to me,go to the other room or just straight up ignore me even when i was talking to them offering different ideas of what we might do.At some point i was begging them to tell me whats wrong until they told me in the most simple manner ‚Äú i just wanted to go out over the weekend and yeah i chose to stay here with you but im still a bit pissed isnt it normal?‚Äù ending the conversation And that stuck so deep . I cannot comprehend it.Is it selfishness and egoism or am i being wrong about it?What should i do ?",

        "text": "TL/DR:at bottom\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground: A notorious laboratory services company (rhymes with \"fan door\") has a penchant for overcharging by a few dollars for what should be a contracted fee. In most states lab services are not a copay item and included in the service for a doctor. Typically a insurer will pay between 25-30 USD for common lab work. They typically overcharge just enough e.g. 32 USD to cause a small residual charge to remain, normally less than 5 USD. Interestingly enough they will send to collections for such a small amount. Repeated talks to billing to resolve this issue would go no where, the person on the other end said \"not her problem\".\n\nSo tired of this residual cost, (that is not always known upfront either) and tired of giving out my CC number for a phantom charge later. I decided to fight back. I had a condition that required multiple checks for common blood-work come up. Each and every week I went in and declined to offer my CC, stating you will need to bill me . They would try to not serve me without, whereas I knew the law and they had to offer me a fixed price for services and a cash way to pay and settle that day. Without a fixed price they couldn't and were required by law to bill later. \n\nSending a bill costs money about 2-5 USD. I would then promptly OVERPAY said bill by exactly $10.68 USD. The minimum amount required by law to remitted within 30 days. Sending a check costs anywhere from 4-20 USD and medical repayments require a Hippa compliant processor so on the high end. So a cost of 25-30 for me to be billed and a repayment check issued. \n\nI did this for 6 months and figure it cost them me alone 700- 800 USD.\n\nBeing the only game in town waiting became an issue. Others were just as hesitant to offer a CC for payment and it is common knowledge about collections from this company for trivial charges. I therefore explained the rule of law (showing the statues and how to complain if they violate them) and how to get back at them. I figure in 26 weeks I had nearly 100 persons enjoy the malicious nature of this and decide to apply the rule of law. So 70-80K USD in costs associated with crappy billing practices, that I was aware of. I don't know how many my conspirators got to go along with it, but I was approached by someone telling me to do the same thing. (seems everyone was tired of it)\n\nNext time I had blood work, was another series  of tests and fully ready to go another round of malicious check writing, it was amazing. Not only was the billing correct, but was completely covered by insurance. They no longer ask for a CC number and seem to be in line. Service improved at the lab so wait times went down, since they were not worried about billing anymore. One tech made the offhand remark that some lady was fired at the billing group and new person straightened them out within a few weeks. \n\nNotes: Yes in the USA, no I will not give the state. Rules vary so research if you attempt this. Over-payment is not always refunded in every state. \n\nTL/DR: Giant Company will not bill properly, wants personal info. I use the rule of law to cost them money until they change.",

        "text": "I heard this story at a union conference about 5 years ago. It was presented as one of the union victories for the year. There was a company who employed around twenty or so cleaners. The award agreement for the amount of cleaners worked by square feet of floor space, number of toilets, number of hand basins, number of staff kitchens, bins etc. Both union and management had got to the same number and the staff were worked fairly.\n\nAfter a couple of years new management take over and stop using casual cleaners for backfill for leave etc. This means each day they are basically short staff not making the agreement terms. Than a couple staff leave and not replaced. Management start complaining that the place isn't up standard and customers had complained. They threaten the staff with punishment etc. One of the cleaners calls the union and union calls an industrial dispute with the employer.\n\nIn the dispute the employer has no where to go on this. The award spells out the formula for staffing and the union basically say if you don't like we will take you court and you lose after spending a heap of money. HR argue but basically agree to employ more staff and put some casuals on. They say well it may take a few weeks to advertise and interview etc etc so you will have to be patient. There was a real feeling that they were not going to try to hard \n\nThe union says sure on these conditions 1. You can no longer threaten punishment about work due to the short staffing 2. you try your best to get staff 3. That cleaners will clean only the amount covered by the award each day 4. any complaints to be given to the union not the staff during this time.\n\nThe third point becomes the sticking point but HR agree on the condition that cleaners make the customer side of the business a priority. Its agreed upon. The union leave with the distinct impression HR will drag their feet on employing new staff. The union goes to the staff and say what's happened and the staff are unhappy about not getting staff immediately. The union organiser tells you only have clean so much space so focus on the customer side of the business and we ask you than not to clean any of The HR staff offices, tea room or toilets. The same goes for the executive staff area of any department managers office. Don't even empty a bin there. Be completely compliant with the offer.\n\nSo after a week HR hasn't advertised or employed any new staff but the cleaners report that all the office kitchens in HR and executive look untidy and the bathrooms smell a bit. Bins are filling up fast etc. At the beginning of the second week the union gets a phone call about cleaners not doing their work from HR. The union asks is the customer side clean and they agree it very clean. Well the union says this is our agreement. Still HR doesn't advertise for jobs. . By the end of second week the CEO asks the cleaners why the offices look terrible. The cleaners say ring the union. There is complaints coming from everywhere in the company about the state of staff amenities etc and the CEO is unhappy The CEO rings and organise a meeting with the union for the next day.\n\nBY this stage the executive office bins are overflowing, the managers offices are dusty. The bathrooms are far from clean and since no cleaner been in there , there is no soap or toilet paper. In the meeting the CEO asks what's going on with your union members. The union organiser explains about their deal with HR and the short staffing. The union organiser state we have been completely compliant with what was asked of us. The CEO claims he's was unaware The CEO is livid. HR is rang and asked to explain. HR gets blasted and jobs get advertised that day. A deal is struck for overtime for any cleaner who will clean the offices of the executives.  \n\nThe union had the extra staff employed within two weeks(plus a casual pool) . Some of the union members picked up some handy overtime money too. Every meeting with the company after that was highly productive for the union and it's members.",

I come bearing an experience just before American Thanksgiving involving nature's dumbest fowl, Turkeys!\n\nWas driving home from the gym today and discovered a stupid of turkeys. I know flock or rafter is applicable but calling them a stupid is funnier and more accurate in my humble opinion. I don't know about other places, but turkeys in Massachusetts have been protected a little bit too long. They think they're invincible.\n\nMost wild critters will flee when they see an oncoming vehicle. Turkeys? They'll turn and stare at you and say, \"Try me, bitch.\"\n\nSo I was driving home and encountered a rather large stupid of turkeys. I want to say 8-10, some were on the sidewalk, some were on the road. I actually had to use my horn to get the darn birds to scoot. Immediately after the stupid I turned a corner and saw a guy walking his dog. He couldn't see the birds because of a hedge in the way, but I stopped and rolled down my window. \"Sir? You might want to go a different direction. There's a bunch of turkeys around the corner.\"\n\nHe scoffed and said, \"Just you watch. It'll be fine.\"\n\nYou know I did just that. Scooted my car out of the way a little and turned my hazards on. Guy sees me flip them on and gives me a bit of a look, but I just grin and give him a thumbs up.\n\nHe walks up the street, turns the corner and I hear his dog see the birds. BORKBORKBORKBORK! Goes the dog. Seconds later I see a man hustling back down the road dragging his dog, who is still facing the turkeys and voicing his displeasure. They're being pursued by the largest pair of turkeys, plumage fully deployed and channeling their inner Canadian Geese. Wound up being chased for about a house and a half before the turkeys considered their honor upheld and went back to the stupid.\n\nI got a really dirty look when he realized I was watching and laughing my ass off.",

Clueless of our contracts. Lately he‚Äôs been up my ass because I‚Äôve been ‚Äúdoing too much‚Äù to get these orders out the door. There‚Äôs been some major issues with how orders have come over which results in us going back and forth between our customer and the company the orders come through from (the ordering platforms). They‚Äôve resulted in some research on my end that‚Äôs taken up some time but fills up space in my day. Basically I find the solution, tell them how to fix it, and then it comes over fixed and good to go that same day. Makes all our lives easier.\n\nAnyway, back to the IT manager. We had a meeting that he got really nasty in to the point he stuck his finger in my face and silently cussed me out. We had to share a space for the meeting because my Teams wasn‚Äôt working and I had to go to his office for it. I‚Äôm trying to explain the situation to our customer and order processing site that the orders are coming over with wrong/outdated information along without an order number and he basically tells me I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about and that I shouldn‚Äôt be throwing the order processing company under the bus. He‚Äôs done this a few times and tried to humiliate me in front of the company. \n\nMy solution? Fine. I‚Äôll let wrong orders sit. I wont do anything with them or help you all. If the customer questions it, I‚Äôll just tell them I was informed that IT wants to handle it now. I won‚Äôt work through any orders to get them to ship unless they‚Äôre right and load right. I‚Äôll just keep myself CC‚Äôd on those emails between IT and the customer and watch it all burn.",

        "text": "The leaf collection company for my neighborhood has absurdly strict rules about where leaves must be for pickup. I live at the end of a cul-de-sac, so my curb is curved and pretty short (about 30' / 9m) long. My property is wedge-shaped, so my back yard is quite long (200' / 60m) and has 40-50 oak trees. I also have two sugar maples in my front yard. So, leaves. Lots of leaves.\n\nPickup rules state leaves must be within 5' of the curb, but on the road. They must also be at least 15' from a mailbox. Because subscriptions for leaf pickup are by individual homeowner, neighbors are not allowed to combine leaves and cannot buy a group subscription. Subscribers must only put \"their\" leaves from \"the current year\" out for pickup. Pickup trucks use GPS to identify homes who have signed up and ignore leaves in front of homes that did not sign up.\n\nBecause I have so many leaves and so little curb (only 15' of available curb due to the required distance from a mailbox), I called the leaf collection company and asked to put the leaves along a longer curb I share with my neighbor. \"No problem,\" they said. Great.\n\nThe truck came through and picked up a fraction of the pile and left the rest of the pile the driver decided was in front of my neighbor's property. I called the company back and a different person said those are the rules. I'll just have to figure it out.\n\nFine. Now it's on.\n\nI have 15' of width and 5' of depth. There is, however, no limit on height. I moved the remaining leaves to my available curb space. I collected the rest of my leaves and added them to the pile. I spoke with my neighbors and acquired the rights to their leaves by paying them $1 each. Now they are all \"my\" leaves. I shoveled / swept the leaves off the streets. They went on the pile. I collected the purchased leaves from the neighbors. They went on the pile. Leaves continued to fall, so I kept adding them. It was a lot of work, but the pile was over 12' tall. I spent a ton of time using a snow shovel to fling the leaves to the top of the pile that was more than 5' above my head. Neighborhood residents stopped to gape at the epic leaf mound.\n\nI am happy to battle willful ignorance with malicious compliance. I reminded myself of this every time I spent another hour tending to the obscenity on my curb.\n\nThe truck came today. The pile dwarfed the truck. They had to drive away and dump leaves, then come back and reload. Twice.\n\ntl;dr Leaf collection company won't let me put leaves on a longer curb so I collect everyone's leaves and create a 12-foot pile.",

We were open the day before Thanksgiving till four, then closed Thanksgiving. \n\nI volunteered as I was a college student on Thanksgiving break. I came to work that night and was left a note about temps, timing and packaging, but no numbers/quantities.\n\nThis made me nervous, so I called the manager at home and said how many pies do you want me to bake? She told me to keep baking until she came in. And I questioned that, asking how many pies exactly do you want me to make?\n\nShe, obviously irritated, told me that I didn‚Äôt need to worry about how many, just keep cooking until she came in at five. OK! \nCue malicious compliance‚Ä¶\n\nI loaded a six wheeler cart with frozen pies. Put them on trays and started baking. As the pies were baking, I prepped racks ahead of time and folded boxes while pies cooled‚Ä¶ I was a logistical savant. Everything went perfectly and I was a machine operating at optimal efficiency. \n\nBy the time she came in at five, I had cooked every pumpkin pie in her freezer.\n\nShe. Lost. Her. Shit.\n\n‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?! What am I supposed to do with all these pies? You cooked over 400 pies and I only have orders for 100?!‚Äù\n\nThe store manager, hearing the commotion, came over and asked what was going on. She said ‚Äúshe cooked every pie we have in the store, even the Christmas ones! What am I supposed to do with all these pies?! \n\nhe asked ‚Äúwhy did you cook all the pies?‚Äù\nAnd I told him ‚Äúshe told me to.‚Äù \nHe asked her if that was true and she said ‚Äúno, well, I told her keep cooking til I got here, but nobody‚Äôs ever cooked that many before, I didn‚Äôt even think it would be close!‚Äù \n‚ÄúThen this is on you‚Äù he replied and walked away.\n\nThe best part was that since we were closed the next day, the employees were allowed to take all the leftover bakery items home with them. I took home 10 pumpkin pies and multiple bags of bread and rolls.\n\nEvery other employee in the store was very very grateful",

I think he knew that the eighth graders weren't happy with the new changes to the school (the school had recently undergone lots of renovations, but lost a lot of character and it's an arts school!) so had the students write our own declaration of independence. We're not done yet, but when we are they'll be sent to the principal without any warning. This assignment has gotten the eighth graders (and some people from other grades) in a revolutionary mindset. Recently, a lot of people have been going around with the word \"hat\" taped to their forehead, because we aren't allowed to wear hats. Whenever the principal walks by a group of kids wearing these he glares at them angrily, but he knows that he can't punish us because there's no rule against having paper on your forehead. (The teachers are actually supportive of our movement. I don't think they like the principal either)\n\nSo here's the malicious compliance part. As I was leaving, one of the outside monitors jumps in front of the big middle level doors and tells us we can't use them anymore. She said that the principal told her to and she had no idea why, but she enforced it. This was definitely for one of two reasons:\n\n1. He doesn't want us to trample the grass (Which is dumb, because grass exists to be eaten by animals)\n2. He's getting payback any way he can\n\nI knew it was obviously number 2. So when I left out the other doors, I walked through the gravel patch to where the door left out, and cut across the grass.\n\nBig buildup for a pretty underwhelming conclusion, but this is only the beginning.",

        "text": "Twenty plus years ago i was working as a radiographer(x-ray Tech) in rural Australia. The radiology department was frantically busy. We worked shifts between 8am to 9pm seven days a week. On weekends we had only two radiographers. One who worked 8-4 and another working 1-9pm. After that there was on call. We also had a nurse working from 9-5. It should be noted there was also a radiographer shortage at the time. In was run by two in charge radiographers who  honestly i believed they thought people where robots who shouldn't be paid.\n\nOne Sunday morning I attended work and was the busiest it had ever been. About 11 o'clock i got a call from the boss saying that the other radiographer was sick and there was no one else available could i stay back to 9pm and do the call afterwards. I agreed as patients would suffer etc.\n\nCome five o'clock and i had set a record for most exams done by a radiographer in a day at this work site. I also hadn't had a lunch break. At 8.55 pm and it was the busiest weekday day on record and i was about to leave when i got a trauma call for multiple car accidents. I was overwhelmed and exhausted and rang the boss and second in charge asking for help and was refused with both telling me i had to cope.\n\nCome midnight one of trauma victims needs to go to theatre for urgent orthopedic surgery and x-ray is required. Its a mammoth task that is still going at 8am. (I've been at work now 24 hrs!) I ring downstairs and speak to second in charge. The second in charges berates me for asking for help. I arrive finally back in the department at 830 where the in charge and second in charge await me. There was no thanks for the hard work but met with anger(they were both upset i asked for help the night before) and I'm told to be back at work at 9am to start work for the day. I refuse. they blow up.\n\nWhy this is happening guess who is standing at the door watching all of this? Our Union organiser on his monthly visit. He interrupts explains that what they are asking is illegal and what i have done was illegal and falls to in charge staff to prevent this happening. He explains they will have to pay me overtime at double time(it was Sunday) from 1600 to now plus overtime for missed lunch plus meal break allowance from 4pm every two hours. I also must have 8hrs break between shifts. \n\nIts now 845am and i say well since i need 8hrs break i wont be since my shift is 9-5 today. The two bosses say no we will see you at 445 for 15 minutes as that's 8 hours. i leave and head straight to bed. Apparently while i slept the union organiser blew up with claims of bullying and harassment, unsafe working condition. Lodged formal complaints to senior management etc etc. I heard later the in charge and second in charged got roasted over it.(within a year neither are in the roles) I worked in the UK where there were much more stringent safe work hour rules than this.\n\nMy alarm wakes me up and i arrive promptly at work at exactly 445. The two in charges are waiting for me and one says \"go get some work done\" I reply actually you need to give me a clinical handover as per policy. This take 5 minutes at which point i turn away from the work area and head to the toilet. They yell after me where are you going. I say the toilet. I come back out of the toilet at 456pm and they are waiting for me and they start yelling(another complaint lodged). everyone in the work place stops and is watching including the radiologist who is director of radiology and the in charge radiographer asks \"why did you come at all today\" and i replied simply \"why would any one in their right mind ask?\" \n\nAfter that the director ordered the two in charges radiographer to work to rule and they had to cover all unexpected leave. Within a year there new bosses and double the staff.",

        "text": "So here‚Äôs a malicious compliance story that made my family laugh for years, and still does. \n\nA good few years back, I was about 24-25 years old, I went to Cyprus with my grandparents to visit relatives. My grandparents originally came from there and moved to the UK when they were like‚Ä¶ 16. My cousin, 14 female, also came along. \n\nNow it‚Äôs important to mention that we‚Äôre Greek Cypriots. Certain things are expected when we visit relatives. Such as helping out with things if we can, and offering our help for whatever our host might be doing. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that I have a sight problem, but I‚Äôm extremely independent in spite of it.\n\nSo we were visiting relatives and every time I offered to help out, either taking dishes into the kitchen, bringing them out of the kitchen, washing up, even getting a glass of water, I kept being told to sit down, they could handle it. \n\nI didn‚Äôt understand why, as I‚Äôm perfectly capable. I thought it might be to do with my eyes. \n\nOne day we were visiting a great auntie of ours, who owns a little summer home by the sea, not too far from where we were staying. Now when we visit this auntie, I always go swimming. She‚Äôs literally not even a couple of mins away from the sea. \n\nNow as I went to offer my help to my great aunt, I hear my 14 year old cousin talking to her in Greek. Another important note, I can‚Äôt string together a sentence in Greek. My father is English and had something against us speaking Greek. But although I‚Äôm not a fluent speaker, I can read, write and understand Greek. My family doesn‚Äôt know this. They assume that because I‚Äôm not a fluent speaker, that they can basically hide their conversations between other people\n\nMy cousin was telling my great aunt how clumsy I am. How stupid I am. How I‚Äôm a little‚Ä¶ soft in the head. She was saying it in Greek. She thought I couldn‚Äôt understand her. But I knew exactly what she was saying, even if I couldn‚Äôt string sentences together myself, I knew what she was saying about me. I added 2 and 2 together, and realised my cousin was very obviously telling all my relatives this. She did it, because she thought she‚Äôd get praised if she help bring out the food without me. I was angry, but I knew the perfect revenge. \n\nWe ate lunch, and after we were finished eating, my great aunt asked my cousin for her help to take the dishes in, and do the washing up, as she‚Äôd been on her feet most of the morning, preparing the food. \n\nMy cousin looked at me, knowing my great aunt couldn‚Äôt speak English and said ‚ÄúHey OP, auntie needs help taking the plates in and doing the washing up.‚Äù Because now, she was bored, and expected to run off to the beach and leave me doing the work. \n\nSo I looked at her and said ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm too stupid and clumsy, and soft in the head, to help auntie out. Besides, she asked for YOUR help. Not mine.‚Äù She went pale, realising I knew what she‚Äôd said. But she doubled down.\n‚ÄúI helped bring everything out. You could help take it all in.‚Äù \nI laughed at her, picked up the book I‚Äôd brought with me, and got up from the table. Grabbed the towel I brought with me, and went to walk off. My cousin started whining to my grandparents that I wasn‚Äôt helping her. My grandmother looked at her and said ‚ÄúYou made your bed. Now you lie in it. Your cousin caught you lying about her, and now she can go to the beach, while you help your aunt.‚Äù My cousin went completely white then. \n\nSo I went to the beach. Swam for thirty minutes, then chilled out on a deckchair, reading my book under the shade of a nice umbrella. By the time my grandparents called to me that we were heading home, my cousin had spent all of it helping to wash up, and dry things, and put them away. She hadn‚Äôt gotten to be lazy and go to the beach, to enjoy the sea. \n\nI could‚Äôve helped her. I simply decided that I wouldn‚Äôt, as she never earned my help. Since then, every time we went to a relatives home, and she was asked to help, I watched with a smirk on my face. To this day, (I‚Äôm 37 this year) I still won‚Äôt help her. \n\nShe made out I was incapable to people. So now she suffers the consequences. It‚Äôs the malicious compliance that keeps on giving to me.",

We are not ready for that yet!\" And he abruptly stops everyone from walking out and tells me to wait backstage for the show to start. \n\nI tried telling him that the show already started and we are ready for the parade right now, but he was not having any if it and instructed me to wait for my cue to start the show. Then he walked away trying to get the parade perfect before they walk out. \n\nFine.\n\nI wait probably 2-3 minutes for my \"cue\" to go out and \"start the show\" knowing full well that my King, MY LEIGE, was left a fool by himself on stage waiting for me to return with the party. So I grab a few crackers from a food tray back stage and walk out on stage obnoxiously eating them like nothing had happened. \n\nThe King looks at me, annoyed, and asks, \"Well, Where is the rest of the show?!\"\n\nI reply surprised and with food in my mouth, \"OH! You were serious!!!!\"\n\nKing says, \"YES! YOU IDIOT!! GO GET THEM!!\"\n\nThe crowd was laughing and having a good time and I was finally able to bring in the troops. The director, once realizing his mistake,  profusely apologized for not listening to me and the show was able to go on. \n\nLater found out that the King was there awkwardly for about 30 seconds before realizing something was amiss backstage. He was able to keep the crowd entertained with some jokes and random middle age facts.",

Straight sassy. \n\nA customer orders one of our smaller burger meals, including one of our smaller Pattie‚Äôs, to eventually eat in the lobby. The junior bacon cheeseburger comes with a small, hot (2oz) patty, cold cheese , cold lettuce, hot bacon, cold tomato‚Ä¶.cold Mayo.. see where I might be going with this? The repeat customer definitely didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs crucial to eat this burger within a couple minutes of receiving to really enjoy the burger.\n\nSo any way, We hand out the bag of goodies, then we see him ten minutes later walk in the lobby with the bag in his hand, open, losing all that crucial temperature. He sits down. What happens next is something I could only describe as, Ala Tom Segura , weird shit. \n\nI mean for like the 1930s it would be normal, but this dude whips out a newspaper from seemingly nowhere (like seriously he was only holding a paper bag saying Mendys), flaps it open like he‚Äôs in the movies, finagles a Monacle out of his shirt pocket, actually USES it‚Ä¶and about ten minutes later he takes a bite out of his now-room-temperature burger. Yes, we all watched. Like, there were customers galore in the drive thru but this was a sight to see. I then returned to my duties. About a picosecond later (time flies) Steampunk Stew approaches the counter with the fervor of a kid asking us for a free toy with a more-than-half eaten burger in tow . \n\n‚ÄúThis meep waszh cold mam‚Äù . The dichotomy of his talking with a mouthful of food while being dressed to the nines paralleled how his burger was supposed to taste‚Ä¶Hot and Cold. And he was talking to Bruce so he meant Man, just to add to the schleppiness of his overall vibe. \n\nBruce asked him, at the risk of getting further pummeled by chunks of drippy chunks of mouthmeat, to repeat himself. He stood there chewing for an awkwardly long amount of time. \n\n‚ÄúThe MEAT! It‚Äôs flunking COLD!‚Äù\n\nBruce begins to MendySplain that ‚Äúthe smaller burgers, even at there very hottest, rapidly react with the very cold lettuce, Mayo and tomato. You ordered the burger an hour ago. If you don‚Äôt plan on eating it right away we can always ..‚Äù\n\nStew interrupted to shout \n\n‚ÄúI can‚Äôt eat this shit! ‚Äú\n\nBruce= ‚Äúsir you‚Äôre eating it right NOW!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOh you‚Äôre gonna replace what I ate ‚Ä¶..I have my rights. I know how it IS‚Äù\n\nBruce started to reply ‚ÄúBut you ATE‚Ä¶‚Äù then he had an M C epiphany\n..‚Äùokay‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll replace what you ate‚Äù\n\nI was very excited to hear this, so best believed I turned to see what he was up to‚Ä¶I was so excited, usually it‚Äôs ME who commits some mc, and Bruce is the chill one. But not this time.\n\nYou see, Bruce is a true neat freak. We‚Äôre like the odd couple. And evidently being spit on made Bruce very malicious.. Bruce style. I couldn‚Äôt wait to see way he was about to do. \n\nI first knew he was up to churlishness was when he insisted on taking the heavily patchoulied man‚Äôs burger back. Oh it was glorious. Never before had he looked so handsome, so‚Ä¶debonair as when he double gloved to take this man‚Äôs burger, put it on a wrapper, and assemble an identical burger which he cut perfectly to match the other 40 percent of the burger that stew hasn‚Äôt eaten. He nuked the old burger to kill any steampunk midochlorians left hanging around, and reassembled his burger puzzle and wrapped it like it was new. \n\nHe handed it to Stew and you better believe we all waited to see the aftermath. Homeboy opened the burger right there, and with a look of disgust yelled ‚Äúare you funking kidding me?‚Äù He threw the burger at the wall and ran out, swearing that he‚Äôll ‚Äúyelp us until we close‚Äù. I‚Äôm so proud of Bruce, though I know he‚Äôs ashamed.",

        "text": "Years ago, long before smart phones or Fitbits, a coworker of mine, Bob, had a relatively mild heart attack. We joked in secret that it was caused by his wife, but the other secret is, we weren't really joking. \n\nShe was awful. She was just an intolerable person, and no one liked her. I'm pretty sure Bob didn't like his own wife. If he did, it was probably Stockholm Syndrome. \n\nAt any rate, when Bob returned to work, he returned with a Pedometer clipped to his belt. Every day, Bob would walk as much as he could when he wasn't pinned down to his desk, but he was suffering and his work was suffering. \n\nAs his supervisor at the time, I figured he was struggling with his recovery, so we just moved a lot of his work to others and left him with the cases he specialized in. That worked for everyone, because those cases drove others nuts and he was a whiz at them. His other work was comparatively easy.\n\nHowever, at the end of his first full week back the issue became more clear. I overhead Bob's wife berating him in the parking lot because he didn't even meet half of his steps goal. \n\nTurns out, the Pedometer didn't come from his doctor; it came from his wife. She was demanding that Bob increase from his current ~4,200 steps a day that were almost killing him to somehow 10,000 steps a day. \"This will read at least 10,000 at the end of every workday, or it'll be your ass,\" were her words. \n\nNow, Bob was a tall guy with a long stride, so she was somehow expecting him to fit in over 6 miles of walking during his workday while recovering. But you know, since he'd had a heart attack, maybe she was just looking out for him, right? \n\nNope. His doctor had actually cautioned him against overdoing it. He was only supposed to be walking 1.5 miles a day, and not all at once. But his wife wasn't having it. She demanded more, and he tried but wasn't doing so well. After another week of this, and another chewing out in the parking lot. We developed a plan. \n\nBob's pedometer just sat on the corner of his desk while he was working. If anyone had to walk down the hall or to the other building, they'd grab the pedometer on their way out of the office. \n\nBob did have to tolerate another couple of ass-chewings, because we ramped him up to 10,000 steps instead of jumping straight there. We figured that would be suspicious otherwise. \n\nIn the end, Bob got his 10,000 steps every day. Well, Bob's pedometer registered over 10,000 steps every day, and almost 1/3 of them were actually his steps. Bob was overjoyed to have the help, and we were all willing to keep the secret (because we were frightened of her turning on us).\n\nTeamwork makes the dream work.",

It was an entire meal, salad, pasta, and a drink completely for free. No stipulations listed on the card other than presenting and exchanging it. Typically I didn't eat lunch because I couldn't afford to, so this was an insanely good find that meant that day, for whatever reason, the universe was paying for my lunch. I picked it up and when lunchtime hit I ran over to the diner since it was fairly close and asked for my meal to go, presenting the card. I only had a 30 minute lunch break and was paid by time punches so it was pretty strict. The place was empty and the old woman scowled at me and told me the offer was dine in only. I showed her the card and pointed out that nowhere on the card does it state that. She scoffed and insisted it was dine in only. I thought about it for a second and since the place was dead I asked for a table. I ordered exactly what was offered with the card, went through the charade of waiting for her to bring it all out separately on their fancy plates, each time smiling at the same rude old woman that was now serving me. When everything was in front of me, she said if I needed anything to let her know. I immediately requested to go boxes and her fake hostess facade dropped entirely. She had someone else bring them out to me. Leaving the card on the table, I hurridly packed everything up, including my drink, and took it back to work to scarf down on my second break. It was the best free spaghetti I ever had.",

Well, we pick up the cake and put in the order for pizzas to be ready at 12 noon (local supermarket makes great cake and pizzas except it's pickup only - no biggie it's 10 minutes away) and get to the workshop early to setup for an 11am start. My wife asks the employees at the shop when the kids will eat pizza and cake, and we're told they'll paint for about 30-45 minutes before breaking for pizza. Then, they'll do the second part of their crafts around 12:30 and we'll serve cake around 1pm. \n\n*hmmmmmm*\n\nMe: Hey, Honey. We should probably call the pizza place and let them know to push the pizzas up to about 11:30.\n\nW: Don't worry, you're stressing over nothing. Just leave it.\n\nMe: OK. Cool. *while grinning ear to ear in my head knowing what will commence in about an hour*\n\nSee, my daughter is in first grade, and as you all know first graders are full of energy - even when they have an empty stomach. Especially when they have an empty stomach. Well, 11:30 rolls around and my wife informs me I should go get the pizzas. Remember, the market is 10 minutes down the road, and when I get there it's a mad house. Thankfully, the pizzas are ready by 11:45, but I still need to pay for them, get in the car, and drive back. Easily a 10-15 minute jaunt before arriving at the workshop. It's 11:55 and my wife calls me in a frenzy.\n\nW: Where are you??!!! Where are the pizzas!!???\n\nMe: *grinning ear to ear in the car* You put the pizza order in for noon. *momentary pause* But, I'm 5 minutes away. \n\nW: OMG, can you hurry? The kids are starving!!!\n\nMe: I thought you told me not to stress over this. üòÜ\n\nI was loving every minute of it. Kids were fine, just rowdy. The workshop employees and owners were having fun with them as well. Pizzas are a hit, and the kids devour almost everything like piranhas. Order is restored and we're off to part 2 of the crafts, serve cake AND cupcakes that the kids devour like piranhas, and all the classmates left with their own personalized craft creation happy.\n\nNeedless to say, my wife was wiped out after we finished loading the car to head home. On the car ride I got to hear about how much chaos ensued about 10 minutes after I left. The kids were huuuuungry, and my wife got super stressed out that the kids were letting her know they were huuuuuuuungry. I just had to remind her again, \"don't worry, you're stressing over nothing.\" This time cackling like a maniac. She didn't like that ü§∑ \n\nIn the end, the party was a success. The kids had fun, my daughter had fun, staff were tipped well, and everyone was happy - even my wife (despite her moment of stress).\n\nTL;DR: I guess I should've called the pizza place.",

I hold a CDL as well as equipment operator license Among others so most of the larger companies know me and are more than happy to have me around. \n\nOver the weekend I was called by the biggest company in my city to help with hauling snow to the city snow dump (a gravy job) and lots of hours.\n\nI had never worked with their crew but quickly got along with everyone but the company ‚Äúgrump‚Äù  which was expected.  Of course the company grump is the one working on the weekend loading trucks. After the first location he gave me some cash to get us coffee.\n\nI meet him at the next location and hand him his drink. He takes a drink and noticed it‚Äôs wrong. He gets out of the bobcat and throws the full extra large coffee into the distance, getting caught by the wind, spraying me with liquid, all while cursing me out.\n\nI decided to let it go, everyone has been working long hours and well, some people in construction are just giant man children.

        "text": "I‚Äôm going to be very vague to not bog this down with jargon. I work in a fairly prestigious biology lab on the east coast where we study various pathogens, and for one project, I was trying to isolate a certain bacteria from samples containing a wide array of species in order to infect mice with the strain under various conditions. While doing research to see if there were mediums that were selective for the target bacteria or if there were antibiotics that my target was resistant against that would kill everything else, I ended up with various ways to isolate the bacteria, using a process I thought of myself to test the efficacy of each isolation method.\n\n\n\nBefore starting my experiment, I ran it by my coworker who is a seasoned immunologist of 10 years, let‚Äôs call him Dan, who trained me in working with bacteria when I started the job. I‚Äôll probably rant about Dan in another post. He thinks it‚Äôs great and gives it the green light, and for the next two months, I‚Äôm running the experiments, calling biotech/pharma companies for quotes on their products that I‚Äôm using to isolate the bacteria, and end up with a big spreadsheet that contained both the efficacy and cost/benefit analyses of all the methods I came up with or found.\n\n\n\nI show my results to Dan and he‚Äôs ecstatic, although he mentions that it‚Äôs likely going to be awhile before we use the data and make a decision on the isolation method due to us waiting on samples to come in. I send the spreadsheet along to my PI (head scientist at a lab) anyway and shift my time to other projects I‚Äôm working on. Another couple months go by and after not hearing anything from Dan about patient samples, another coworker comes up to me and asks me where I could find a set of certain plates to isolate the target bacteria from. I‚Äôm confused and ask him why he‚Äôs looking for those, because based on my experiments, the plates he wanted were the least efficient and most expensive way to select the bacteria we were looking for, not to mention that I had no idea that we had ordered any more than the 10 plates I used to run my experiment. He argued me, and said that Dan‚Äôs research said otherwise. That confused me even more and when I asked him to show me what he was talking about, he proceeded to show me /my own spreadsheet,/ where he quickly realized that he had been misled and said that Dan must have made an error in the spreadsheet. I told him that I was the one who ran the experiments and got the results, and if Dan ordered the bad plates, then he had just wasted the lab‚Äôs money. The other coworker said \n I probably told Dan to order the wrong plates, but when I said I had no idea plates were being ordered at all, all he had to say to that was ‚Äúoh. That‚Äôs weird.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSure enough, later that day I look inside our cold room and see several boxes, roughly 5.5 thousand dollars worth, of the expensive and inefficient plates, and I confront Dan about it. I asked Dan why he ordered so many plates, and if he had been telling other people that he had done the experiments. He laughs a little before asking if I had even read the spreadsheet that I made, and states that the plates he ordered were the best based on my criteria, and that because he taught me how to work with bacteria, I was ‚Äúpiggybacking‚Äù his methods and that him validating my experiment before running it was tantamount to him doing the work. He told me not to worry about it anymore and that he would be presenting the data to the PI because he had already prepared a slideshow and everything for it. I wanted to open up the spreadsheet and tell him that he had just wasted a lot of money, but he was so condescending and sure of himself about having ownership of my work that all I said was ‚Äúokay‚Äù before returning to my bench. \n\n\n\nLater that week, we have our lab meeting where Dan is presenting ‚Äúhis‚Äù work to the whole lab and states that we can finally move ahead with isolating the target bacteria from patient samples. Sure enough, my spreadsheet is on the TV used as our projector, and my PI asks when we could expect the materials used in the most efficient isolation method to arrive. Dan corrects the PI, stating that the bad plates were the best and very proudly stated that the plates had already arrived. I then interjected, very bluntly saying that the plates he ordered would recover over 90 percent LESS of the bacteria than the method my PI had picked from the spreadsheet. \n\n\n\nDan fell silent, face going shades of red before he stumbled through a justification of ordering the bad plates, how in the long run we‚Äôd save some money by not ordering the materials needed to do the method my PI wanted,  only for my PI to chime in stating it was absolutely worth it if it meant a tenfold increase in recovery, and that we shouldn‚Äôt be wasting samples, time, and money on bad plates.\n\n\n\nDan very quickly blurted out that it was my spreadsheet and that there must have been a miscommunication between us before ordering the plates before he quickly sat down, and all I said was that I was not told by anyone that anything off my spreadsheet was being ordered. My PI asked Dan if he submitted the data to me before I sent it to him, and Dan sheepishly admitted that I was the one who ran the experiments and compiled everything, so he must have misread my data and ordered the wrong materials, and was about to suggest that I possibly misspoke when showing him my data the first time before my PI cut him off to move onto the next lab topic. The rest of the meeting he was red, glaring at me out of the corner of his eye.\n\n\n\nAfter the lab meeting, Dan pulled me aside and asked me why I didn‚Äôt tell him that he ordered the bad plates, I told him that since it was his research he should have known what method gave the best results since he would have calculated the yield of each method when doing the experiments, and that if he wanted my input he should have told me before he ordered them.\n\n\n\nI went to the PI and cleared up the confusion, putting in the right order for the materials needed to best isolate the target bacteria from our samples and making sure he knew that I had no idea that my data was being acted upon in case Dan went behind my back to somehow throw me under the bus. \n\n\n\nNeedless to say, we communicated far less after that whole ordeal and I quickly found other people in the lab to work with. I later found out that he had been taking credit for all the work I did ever since starting in the lab, and while it frustrates me to still have to tell people every now and then that I made the figures or did the experiments that Dan had told them about when my data comes up, more people have come to me to discuss their projects and ask for my help since Dan was exposed, and I find solace in the memory of his red, twisted face looking like it was going to explode in front of everyone, barely able to make out a word to cover his ass.",

        "text": "This happened quite a few years ago so I might be a little fuzzy on the exact details so bear with me. \n\n\nThe real estate agent I was renting from at the time decided that they would no longer be taking payments via bank transfer, but rather through a third party company that had a debit card type system. This card included various discounts for various businesses, you just had to send them your rent every month rather than the agent. Sounds like a great deal until you look at the fine print. \n\n\nAs well as an initial set up fee, each transaction would incur a small transfer fee. Granted, this added up to less than a dollar per month but BY GOD they were not going to charge me for the convenience of sending them money. \n\n\nI did some digging into the tenancy laws in my area and discovered that they were obligated to offer an alternate payment option. After some back and forth with the agent I was informed it was either the ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù payment card or delivering a cheque to their office every month. \n\n\nI signed up to have a free cheque book delivered to my house and dropped that sucker off every month. \n\n\nWas it a pain in the ass? Yes. But I relished the look on their faces every time I handed over the cheque and declined their offer to set up an account with the third party company. I would smile thinking about the admin assistant having to take time out of their work day to take my stupid cheque down to the bank.",

        "text": "   Side note this is not my story I‚Äôm sharing it. So sit back and enjoy. \n\nContext: this guy works at a local railroad and spent most of his time switching and assembling trains in the yard. Now on with the story: \n\nI was called to work afternoon Bowl job in Barstow 1977. Started gathering up bowl tracks to take to Departure yard. After I stopped to shove my cut I notice someone get into a gondola and I climbed  to look inside an it was a Hispanic man. I told him he needed to get out in Spanish and he refused\n\n\n   The Gondola had about two inch steel metal rods in with about two feet of space on left side of it. The transient was occupying that space. Yardmaster called on radio asked why I wasn't moving. I told him the problem and he told me to make the shove. I told him I couldn't do that because it would be unsafe move because if load shifted man could get impaled.\n   Then I heard \"are you refusing to do your job \"?. I told him no I wasn't not refusing to do my job but I couldn't move the cut for safety reasons.\n\n\n  Yardmaster tells me to make the man get out. I told him I had already told him to get out in Spanish but he wouldn't cooperate.  Again I was told to just shove the cut in the clear and again I tell him I can't because of safety reasons. Now I am getting mad and I tell him to send Gumshoes to get him. Again he accuses me not obeying a direct order. Again I tell him it would be unsafe to do so. If load shifted it would kill the man.\n\n\n  Now just silence as I wait for someone to come and remove him. Gumshoes finally show up and get him out. I call yardmaster and tell him it is save to move and I start my shove.\n\n\n  After I finished my move I went into shanty and crews know what has been on and see I am livid. I now have to use the restroom which is halfway up Bowl Tower so I go running up the stairs to use it.\n  When I get back down all kinds of comments. The guys in the Shanty told yardmaster I was running up to yardmaster's stairs with a brake club and he had better lock the door.\n  I didn't have a brake club and I was only running up the stairs to pee.\n  Those switchman thought that was so funny and I didn't hear another word about me being in subordinate.",

Every year the department director volun-told the shift supervisors that we were all chipping in to buy pizza for the department to help celebrate. \n\nThe first annoyance was that I worked night shift, so she would order the pizza and give me a check to pay for it (this was after we had all contributed whatever amount she determined to be our individual share). Every year, she would order about 6 pizzas for the shift....and include a $2 tip for the driver.  Naturally, I was mortified and I'd end up kicking in my own money for a reasonable tip.  When I brought it up to her, she looked at me blankly and said she never tipped more than $2 for delivery. \n\nThe final straw was the last year she worked there.  She had figured out the pizza bill and determined we all owed $15.75.  Pizza day comes and goes, with me (of course) chipping in another $10 out of pocket toward the tip.  I open my work email, and see that she sent all the shift supervisors a message: she had miscalculated the pizza bill, so we all needed to pay her another $1.65.  Otherwise it wouldn't be fair, as she would be paying in more than we had.  \n\nAt first I saw red.  Then I dreamed up my revenge.  As I said, I worked nights.  So the next night, I spent quite a bit of time flicking 165 pennies under her office door.  Then I emailed her to let her know I'd left the money in her office.  Never heard another word, but I'm sure she crawled around and picked every penny up.",

        "text": "Okay, let's start saying that English is not my first language, so sorry if anything is wrong or doesn't make sense \n\nI (16F) am a pretty shy person with people that I don't know or not close with, so I don't know how to start a conversation. So, my parents (36F and 40M) went in a trip to the beach for two weeks, and I'm staying with my grandmother (idk her age, 56 I think) in my mom's side, I'm saying in her house, and in the house lives my grandfather (also don't know his age) and my uncle (20M) that grown with me like a brother, and, we had this party from my mother's cousin's kid, that came to the town for the holidays (pretty big family btw, Brazilian stuff), and I didn't want to go at all, don't get me wrong, I love my family and all, but I am not close to them, like, they are all pretty older then me, and my uncle always stays with my cousin (16/17M), but I don't like him at all (creepy as fuck with girls), so I kinda always stay lonely in my mother's side family. One day before the party, I went to my grandmother in my father's side (let's call her granny), and she is a sweetheart, pretty supportive with everything. Since I didn't wanna go to the party, I called my mom and my grandmother saying that I'm not going, since I'm gonna stay like the decoration, after a lot insisting and pressure, they start to yell at me saying that \"family is family\" and \"they will miss me in the party\", lies, every time I go to a party I always take care of the toddlers, no one cares if I'm there or not, no one talk to me, they don't even text me, so why would they miss me? After a lot of fighting, that even my uncle got involved (defending his mom and his sister) I gave up, fine, if they want me to go, I'm going. Import detail, my mother's side is pretty sexist, like blue to boys pink to girls, and I'm kinda a tomboy myself, and my mom hates that, my father's family is cool with it, but my mother's family hates, so, I decided to wear some \"new clothes\" to this party.\n\nI told my granny everything and asked her if there's any clothes from my male cousins (my father's family is also big, but there there's more people in my age), she said she had, then I took the \"manliest\" clothes I found, and went to this god damn party. I got there and already got weird looks from my mom's cousins, but I didn't care, I was satisfied when I saw my grandmother's face, she pulled me to the side and asked me what I was wearing, I said since I didn't took any clothes to my granny, I had to take some clothes from my cousins, she scolded me saying I look terrible and look like a boy, I didn't pay attention, and went to the table eat. After some time (long fucking time in silence), one of my mother's cousin (one that I dislike) took my attention in the table and asked me about the school, I replied, a little happy to be included in the chat, but that happiness when she started to ask me about my love life, what I hate to talk about since I'm aroace (asexual and aromantic), so when I said I didn't had any boyfriend, she said: \"well, but dressed like this, you will not have any man, you need to be more feminine, no man will find you attractive like that\" when she said that, I was done, so I just replied: \"Well, I'm glad it's working then, the last thing I want is a man in my life\" I was being dramatic, honestly, but idc. Of course everyone stared at me like I was the devil himself, they keep saying stuff like \"oh you sure?\" \"You're to young\" blah blah blah, I said I was sure, and they changed the topic. When I got home I got scolded from my grandmother, she was pissed, my uncle was as well, she later called my mom saying what I've done, they are saying my hole family now thinks I'm a lesbian, but I don't care, they can think whatever they want, I'm only gonna see then on Christmas anyways. Well, I'm grounded now, but it was worth it, because my mom is mad at me and is not talking to me, that's not a problem tbh, more peace.",

        "text": "Worked for a 3 lettered long distance company in the 90's, whose core business was long distance calls, but all their other products and services routinely flopped. They created a program where if you submitted an idea that gets used, you either get movie tickets, a variance of cash saved or branded clothing. No one cared, however if you submitted an idea, even if it didn't get used, you got a \"lunch buck\" good for a dollar in the cafeteria.\n\nMy friend and I spent a lunch hour submitting ideas like \"put trampolines in the break area\" and \"make our commercials in all black and white\", etc\n\nObviously none of our ideas were taken, but we got lunch bucks for each submission. Game on.\n\nThis started a four month long journey of submitting ideas like\n\"Buy our competition\"\n\"Give phones two mouthpieces so both grandparents can talk\"\n\"Consider carrier pigeons for intra company mail on campus\"\n\"Make phone cords straight\"\n\nThe cafeteria workers didn't care as they were contractors, and the contractor bill was reconciled with a different accountant every month, so no one caught on and we ate free for months until someone in the mailroom told HR we were getting an unusually high amount of lunch bucks.\n\nWe never got in trouble, but the program ended abruptly.",

        "text": "I‚Äôm about to donate all my stuff to travel as a digital nomad but before I‚Äôve even booked my first flight I‚Äôm already facing compliance issues with policies that assume all people reside at an address. In the process of updating my address, I‚Äôm running into problems with websites that want to barf up a NullPointerException when I say I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlive‚Äù ‚Äúanywhere‚Äù. \n\nSo far I‚Äôve tried retaining a mail service. Seemed great; they said I can tell people ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a PO box‚Äù because it‚Äôs a street address. That way I can receive packages. They scan my mail and I have different options for retrieval. They can even deposit checks, as if I‚Äôd have any to receive lol. But seemed cool. \n\nBut a stock broker told me he can‚Äôt trade stocks for me unless I have a *legal* address that‚Äôs capable of receiving, for example, utility bills. And I can‚Äôt be outside of my country for more than 6 months. He cited securities laws. I wonder what the logic behind that was. Time to switch to investing in crypto?\n\nI‚Äôve thought of hiring a homeless person as a consultant for these matters. They must deal with nonsense like this all the time. But the homeless people who typically camped in the alley behind my old apartment typically got their high off fentanyl, not off of malicious compliance.  I doubt they‚Äôre as interested in trying their best to follow rules as I am. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to ask a friend for a favor of using their address. I just want to pay a reasonable fee for some kind of service that satisfies the requirements, albeit unconventionally. \n\nI‚Äôd love to hear how more experienced digital nomads have maliciously complied with the societal expectation and maybe legal requirement that people have a legal address. #FirstWorldProblems",
