(otherwise I just do an OLS regression on macro data, but an experiment would be interesting)\n\nSome ideas I had and issues on them:\n\n1.) Experiment (Game) where individuals choose to either provide 'secret' or not to other user, if they do they get into back/or not --&gt; but this would more test reciprocity.\n\n2.) Experiment where over several rounds user chooses to collect 'gold' or 'information' without knowing the objective of the game --&gt; I think this would be more of a game theory test on how users would maximize their benefits without knowing the goal but might be biased.\n\n3.) Some sort of experiment where user participates in groups objectives, in some objectives they are given knowledge by experts, in some they contribute their knowledge, in others they do 'non-knowledge tasks' and between experiments measure their content with the project, task and team.",

In the U.S., poverty is defined as [a specific dollar amount](http://www.irp.wisc.edu/faqs/faq2.htm) (adjusted for inflation) -- suggesting that with enough economic growth, poverty can be eliminated. In the U.K. poverty is defined not in absolute terms, but as [less than 60% of median income](https://fullfact.org/economy/poverty-uk-guide-facts-and-figures/).   Under the U.K. definition, it seems impossible to get rid of poverty with a \"rising tide that lifts all boats\" but \"poverty\" could be eliminated, for example, with a radically re-distributed economy in which people were fairly equal, even if most people were much poorer overall.

If so, is there some kind of adjustment that I could do (such as controlling for # of years since the latest data for a country was given?).\n\nI guess another alternative would be to use the latest year that all of the countries I'm analyzing have values for (2012), but I'm not sure if that's ideal because in a perfect world I would have Gini values for 2015, which is the year my data come from.",

Given the strong sense of belonging to a clan or family of sorts, and given the way Shinto is a concept subtly weaved into the vertical structure, rather than a separate religious entity on its own, wouldn't the observance of these Western practices be viewed as 'traitorous'? Or is society mature enough to recognise that these celebrations of Western events are simply superficial in nature, and that the celebrating of these holidays and being part of the vertical social structure are not mutually exclusive?",

From the Aztecs to the S.S., there are many groups widely known for their extreme brutality, not only in how many people they kill but in the method by which they do this. Today, ISIS and Mexican drug cartels appear to fill a similar role. People from these organizations appear to be capable of a constant brutal violence that most of us seem unable to stomach. However, stories emerge of ISIS members burning people alive or gangsters in Juarez skinning their victim's faces. What compels people to do these things, even if they presumably find them disgusting?\n\nFrom my very un-academic thinking about this, these \"barbaric\" groups don't really seem to have any kind of class or societal character. Militias who commit acts of extreme cruelty have emerged in colonized countries, developing countries, and the world's wealthiest nations. The Japanese were universally considered by Europeans and themselves to be the \"most civilized\" Asian people, yet the Imperial Japanese Army is responsible for more brutal violence than any other modern group in the region. So what factors influence people, in large numbers and from every background, to commit extremely horrific acts of violence without being stopped by their moral conscience or physical reaction of disgust?\n\nAm I potentially biased to cultural prejudice and media bias, potentially leading me to think of certain groups as more brutal than they actually are?",

Drinking, which has had a mostly steady decline, has begun to rapidly decline since that time as well. There was an article I remember reading showing that among 12-15 year olds, drug usage has declined by 40% since 2012. That's a massive drop in such a short amount of time! \n\nMy question is, why? People might say social media but it was just as present in kids lives in 2012 when drug use was very high as it was in 2017 when drug use has been declining rapidly. In fact the rise in drug use in the late 2000s corresponds directly with the rise in social media, so idk if that's a good reason. Not only that but drug usage in general is more accepted today. ",

Is reflexive modernization still a relevant concept? I haven't found many papers which mention reflexive modernity written in the last few years, and my primary research interests over the past few years have been philosophy and media studies so I'm not very aware of what's 'current' in this area of soc sciences.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/694iv9/what_are_the_factual_bases_for_bill_nyes_claim/",
        "text": "(I originally posted this at r/NeutralPolitics but they rejected it because Gender is more of a social issue than a political one. Thanks)\n\nBill Nye is trending currently because of his claim of there being more than two genders in his new TV series, *Bill Nye Saves the World*. The claim has been heavily criticized (not that the claim was new or anything) by people who believe there are only two genders. So my question is what are the factual bases for Bill Nye's claim that there are more than two genders he makes in his new TV series, *Bill Nye Saves the World?* What are the factual bases of his critics of his claim? And as a followup, if there are more than two genders, then how many genders do academics accept as real genders?\n\nHere's the clip from Bill Nye about the multiple genders in two parts.\n\n[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKZ-P97PgxA)\n[Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjKZ5RzT9s)\n\nHere are some important quotes/claims from Nye's clip - \n\nPart 1\n\n- Biologists, sociologists, anthologists...(are) finding human sexuality is on a spectrum. \n\n- They used to think there were just two settings, male and female, but it's actually a lot sexier than that.\n\n- The first aspect of sexuality is sex\n\n- Not everybody fits into the categories of male or female.\n\n- The next aspect is gender\n\n- We used to think gender and sex were synonymous. But today we use these words differently. Sex is biological, gender is how you identify yourself and your experience.\n\nPart 2 \n\n- So perhaps a person could have a male brain in a female body, and a female brain in a male body. But there are people that define as both genders, or neither gender, or a combination of the two, so you cannot determine the gender of a brain just by looking at it.\n\n- (The third aspect of sexuality is) Attraction (Basically if you are attracted to guys, girls, or both)\n\n- (The last aspect of sexuality is) Expression - How you express yourself to the word. In a lot of places, like the US, many women wear makeup and men usually don't. \n\n[There is another clip of a sketch with ice cream cones.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46h-LfNWPn8) Here's the summary: A vanilla ice cream cone tells all of the the other ice cream flavors that vanilla is the one true flavor and all other ice cream needs to be vanilla. The other ice cream flavors argue with the vanilla cone saying that they can be whatever flavor they are. The other ice cream flavors end up converting vanilla's opinions and all have fun together (being multiple flavors at once).\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't find an in-depth argument against Nye other than people saying \"There are only two genders.\" A semi - example can be here from [Breitbart where they criticize the Ice Cream Sketch.](http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/05/02/bill-nye-uses-ice-cream-cartoon-to-teach-about-the-flavors-of-sexuality/)\n\n&gt; The ice cream orgy is not the first bizarre moment to emerge from Nye’s new show. Another segment included Nye teaming up with actress Rachel Bloom to debut an LGBT sex anthem entitled ‘My Sex Junk.’\nIn the song, Bloom sings lines such as: “This world of ours is so full of choice. But must I choose between only John or Joyce? Are my options only hard or moist? My vagina has its own voice.”\nReviewing the rest of Nye’s show, which is intended to inform viewers about science, Maddie Stone of Gizmodo describes it as “a small amount of information packaged to promote a cartoon caricature understanding of a complex science issue, slanted to the POV of an unabashedly political science comedian.” She adds that Nye spends the majority of the show just “yelling at his audience.”\n\nThank You in Advance!\n\nPS - I do not know enough about this to form an opinion which is why I'm asking here.",

        "text": "While reading about social constructs I've encountered two partialy different uses of the term.\n\nWhen refering to social constructs one might refer to things such as names and money. Although very real they hold some arbitrary value. For example if I were to be named Mary I might as well have been named Abigail and there would be no strong objective reason as to why one name is better than the other. What my name is would be in a degree arbitrary so I might as well change it if I wish to do so.\n\nOn the other hand some use the term more boradly. Social constructs might encompass things both arbitrary or not on the basis that those things are tools created by society to help itself function. For example one might say that the structure of the brain is a social construct. Although different areas of the brain are used for different functions the way we devide and group those areas into lobes is a product of society and subject to change if we decide that our evidence tells us it would be better to do so.\n\nI ask this mostly in relation to non cisgender identities. Using the first meaning of the term one might say that gender is arbitrary so we might as well change the way we percieve it. Using the second meaning of the term one might say that gender is a tool to society and since it doesn't correspond to the experiences of certain members of society at the moment we should change it to better reflect reality.\n\nDo you know of any good texts on social constructs?",

That they feel more masculine or feminine / they identify primarily with masculine /feminine traits?\n\nIs this what people mean when they say that gender is not tied to sex? and that gender is on a continuum?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

For example, people sometimes say that the Japanese are a very conformist society and that people who are visibly \"different\" for reasons of style or manner are shunned or face negative social consequences.  A purported Asian conformity instinct is also sometimes given as an explanation for Chinese and North Korean \"acceptance\" (!) of the dictatorship in those nations, and various other features (or purported featues) of Asian politics and culture, such as public approval for Duterte's drug murders or racism.  Sometimes this can take quite a nasty tinge - videos on r/wtf or /r/MorbidReality etc of people being injured or doing stupid things in places like China are often accompanied by comments to the effect that \"the Chinese don't value human life the way we [presumably Americans] do\".\n\nA less ethnocentric version - and one advanced by some Asian scholars themselves - would be that Asia conceives of human rights as being rights in society rather than the individual as in the political West.  \n\nDoes the idea that Westerners are individualistic whilst Asians are conformist have any social scientific basis, or is it just a stereotype?  \n\nMy own \"instinct\" would be to say nonsense - I don't really believe in \"national characters\", because they've always had the reek of 19th-century racialism to me, but I don't have any basis for this view so thought I'd ask the experts on here.\n\nThanks",

No matter what the context (i.e. politics, life, science etc...) if the debaters are not making a considerable effort to maintain a serious tone after, say, 10 comment exchanges the debate boils down to \"you are DUMB\", \"your intelligence is low\", \"your IQ must be very low\", \"damn you're stupid\".\n\nI find this very interesting because it's not a general trend to believe intelligent people should be correct on every single issue. So, there must a psychological process that makes us believe one is \"stupid\" if they are wrong on a issue we are debating. Also why do people not consider the other person is ignorant instead of stupid?\n\nThis question might be slightly off-topic but I would be very interested if there is a psychological or sociological answer to \"damn you're stupid\" phenomena.\n\nPS: I hope this post won't get flagged because I used quite a few insults :(",

There's a strong focus on historical ones such as the civil rights movement for, and modern ones such as the Arab spring. Both of these and others are revolutionary (in some degrees with the CRM, and clearly with the Arab spring). I'm more interested in causes that require on-going activism around issues on inequality not directly related to race/gender/ethnicity or democracy. \n\nThe first type of organisation I'm confused about are anti-homeless/general poverty combating groups. Are hose who raise awareness with the public such as 'Canadian The Alliance to End Homelessness' considered a 'social movement'? \n\nI feel like there's a category of activist organisation that I haven't come across in my reading. \n\nThe second kind are the more practical sided organisations that provide soup kitchens (for example), whilst also generating publicity for their efforts, reaching out for volunteers and asking for donations.\n\nSorry if that's not clear, and anything relevant to anything I've said would be appreciated.  \n\nThanks.",

A common complaint from people indoctrinated with humanism is how the losers of a tribe such as jobless lifetime beggars, hardcore career criminals, and other scum of the Earth are expected to be taken care of by the members of the tribe........ But outsiders of the tribe, even if they be honest and industrious, are to be discriminated against and even beaten, murdered, and raped. Even in the cases where outsiders show loyalty to the country or other tribal identity and make priceless contributions, they still are targets of violence. While a member of the tribe can rape and murder dozens of women of his tribe but because he is a citizen of the tribe it will be expected that welfare be given to him in an attempt to reform .\n\nBeing raised under dignity culture and a libertarian, I ask about the basis of this psychology?  I don't mean to sound cruel but if we go by logic shouldn't for example say the autistic people who don't make a contribution but are even a big drain on the economy be neglected? While say recent immigrants who are industrious be the one aid is given to?  Or to use a religious example why is it ok for Saudi Aristocracy (who aren't involved in politics) to just sit around and eat and relax without being taxed heavily despite their wealth? While infidels who contribute a majority of the Saudi Arabia's workforce get taxed so ridiculously high? In this example, its even the Saudi aristocracy who are using TAX PAYERS MONEY for their lavish partying lifestyle!\n\nI seen posts in the various social sciences in reddit about emotional bonding being an intrinsic part of human nature that requires one to take care of each other because of familiarity. So I am extremely curious about this psychology of caring for people who don't contribute to the tribe while neglecting outsiders with an immense work ethic and follow the rules.",

        "text": "From what I understand, rational choice theory, at least in a political science sense, is more concerned with *how* people get to their decisions, rather than *what* the decision actually is. I.e. a decision is rational even if it appears to run counter to my interests, so long as I believe it actually is in my interest, and have a clear path of logical inferences leading to that decision. For example, if i'm reliant on Obamacare, but vote for Trump, that's still rational so long as I believe that Trump is better for the economy/Hillary will ruin the country, etc, and so the election of Trump will be more likely (in my eyes) to maximise utility for me.\n\nHowever, I keep reading and seeing criticism of rational choice theory with regards to actors not having 'perfect knowledge' and so decisions will often not be rational. A lot of this is in response to the idea of *Homo economicus* and the more economic side of rational choice theory, but there is a lot of overlap between the two. My issue is that this perfect knowledge criticism doesn't actually seem to matter to a theory that isn't concerned with how empirically true something is, instead concerned with how decisions are reached, and how that can be used with future predictions.\n\nI'm worried I've gone hopelessly wrong in my fundamental understanding of rational choice theory somewhere along the line. Is it instead that rational choice theory echoes the more Classical Liberal thought of saying that people usually do maximise their utility instead of merely attempting to? Or is it instead just a disagreement on the definition of what it means for a decision to be rational?",

        "text": "So apparently the more the proportions of your face resemble [this](http://www.beautyanalysis.com/research/perfect-face/facial-masks/), the more attractive you are. I am starting to question if this is true or not. It is a bit bizarre to think that all of the top models and celebrities actually look pretty much \"the same\" but in the meantime I find this very interesting as it shows how universal beauty standards are.\n\nI will see if users here agree. What would you rate [this face](http://www.beautyanalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Caucasian-Variations-RF.jpg), [this face](http://www.beautyanalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Contemporary-Beauty-02.jpg), and [this face](http://www.beautyanalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/attractive-face1.jpg) out of ten?\n\nSo what are your thoughts on this? Are all of our beauty standards \"universal\"?",

The conclusion is that if a small fraction of the economy has the means to shape policy making that are not available to the rest ( b ), they will make sure that policy design will be to the benefit of this small fraction ( a ), at the expense of the rest ( also ( a ), why miss a growth opportunity? ).\n\nSo in summary, the quoted argument, the way it was quoted, seems extremely weak, however perhaps there is more theory to it?\n",
