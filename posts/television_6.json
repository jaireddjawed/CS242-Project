        "text": "I finally got around to watching Ms. Marvel in it's totality. I had seen enough clips where I felt like I could pass on it since I got the gist. Also thank you Twitter and Facebook because the nerds essentially told me everything that happened before I could even watch it. Overall, I felt like I wasn't missing much. But I got bored the other day and binged the whole series. As messy as it gets towards the middle, I came from this project absolutely blown away by what I was seeing. For some background, I was born in and spent the first ten years of my life in New Jersey. Many of my friends were Pakistani, Indian, Egyptian, Moroccan etc. It was not uncommon to see hijabs and people with dots on their foreheads. I knew a few Sikh kids too. I lived where my dad actually watched the first plane hit on 9/11. You could see the smoke from across the river. For the record, the Muslims were just as afraid as we were that day. There was no cheering to be seen. While everyday afterwards wasn't Kristalnacht it wasn't a cakewalk either. As someone who has always an interest as it concerns ethnic and religious minorities in Western media, I've kinda gotten used to how Muslims or anyone who can be seen as Muslim don't get the best wrap in media. We have seen some amazing progress in the last few years. But to me there is no greater progress than Ms. Marvel. \n\nI'm not very familiar with Kamala Khan as I've never read the comics. I've seen her pop up in some games I've played over the years but never really delved much into the character. I think also what passed me by is the significance of the character. The thing that strikes about the show, especially the first three episodes is how expertly they weave in typical high school teenager tropes we've seen ad nauseam with the unique experiences of being a Pakistani/Desi American and a Muslim. The unique visual style in the first three episodes, goes a long way towards humanizing Kamala and making her seem like your typical American teenager first and whatever else second. I'm not Muslim nor South Asian but growing up as a gay Black teen in the Deep South, we moved after 9/11, I definitely could relate to some of what Kamala was going through. That desire to belong to that world that's right outside but you are steady being pulled back by culture and tradition is something I think of any background can relate to. \n\nThe first three episodes easily could have been their own movie and I would've been satisfied. Kamala's parents, her friends and her community felt wholly relatable to me. There were a few times where I tried to imagine a version of this story that took place in suburban Ohio with a blonde white girl and I honestly could. But yet here we are focusing on a Pakistani American Muslim girl from Jersey City. The show goes to great lengths to emphasize Kamala's Americanness and how she's a merging of both sides. I have never seen this done so expertly in Western media before and for it to come from Disney of all places is absolutely shocking. The corporation doesn't have the greatest reputation when it comes to portraying non-European cultures, especially Asian ones. So for this project to be as good as it is feels like an accomplishment to me. It does break a lot of stereotypes that we've gotten used to by now. The female characters do not treat the hijab or their faith as something confining that they need to be liberated from. In fact, it is outright said in the first episode that Nakia chose to wear the hijab. Islam is not portrayed as any more stringent or restrictive than other faiths. The characters aren't portrayed as hyper religious. Obviously their faith means a lot to them but it's not overdone. We get to see through the many side characters how these are very much normal people where the only difference is the faith they practice. The male characters are largely encouraging of the female characters pursuing their dreams and goals. \n\nI feel like I'm the only one who likes episodes 4 and 5 and I don't disagree that they're uneven. I don't disagree that the villains are about as bad as The Flag Smashers. But there is a lot in those two episodes I really liked. The first half of episode 5 felt like we were in a different show entirely and I didn't mind that all too much. The acting in this first half is outright some of the best acting we've gotten in an MCU project thus far. When the Marvel elements crept back in to rear it's ugly head it wasn't as jarring as I thought it would be. The death of the villains was kinda dumb but luckily it lead to some good shit later on. I very much felt like the Partition of India was something that they had in mind first and then tried to figure out a way to tie it into the rest of the show. For the most part, I think it worked. I also saw what they were trying to do with the Clandestines. The concept of two worlds sharing a border yet one side threatening to overtake and erase that world seems like it could be thematically relevant to cultural themes we've been exploring. I just don't think they were cooked well enough. The motivations given don't entirely make sense and I'm not sure why the villains actually died and I watched this episode twice. I do think this could have been done better. What saves the show for me from being The Falcon and the Winter Soldier levels of bad is that the characters and the visual style are so strong. The unique visual style does come back towards the end. Kamala is a very well written character throughout the show. The exploration of Pakistani culture kept things very interesting for me as well. Thus far when Marvel tries to make something culturally specific yet connected to this larger fantastical universe, it works for me so much better than any of the Ant Man movies or something like Hawkeye and Black Widow. The best projects so far have been Black Panther 1 and 2, Shang-Chi and Ms. Marvel. I haven't seen Moon Knight yet.  I'm very much looking forward to what they do with Echo, Wonder Man, Blade and Nova if the latter two ever get off the ground. \n\nThis feels like one of the more pure translations from comic to screen that we've seen in a way, especially as it concerns the portrayal of the main character. Finally so much of what I felt has been lost in translation with this character has been communicated thoroughly. I hope whatever Pakistani or Bangladeshi or Muslim girl who sees this feels empowered by seeing a superhero who looks like her. This show really sold me on the concept of Kamala Khan and I can't wait to see her in The Marvels. I'd give the show a 7/10. What it gets right it really gets right.",

        "text": "When I first saw the trailer for the upcoming spy-related tv show on AppleTV+ I was intrigued. Eva Green, Vincent Cassel, and Peter Mullan looked good in the trailer. But I was disappointed when the show took a U-turn. \n\nBeing a fan of spy movies and geeking out about movies and shows like Who Am I, Die Hard 4.0, Hackers, and mister Robot I was expecting this show to be about hackers, their fight with corrupt governments, or submitting everyone to anarchy. But this show is not about it at all.\n\nOne of the meanings of Liaison is a secret or an illicit sexual relationship. And now, I can see that the show is about a  connection between Eva's and Vincent's characters.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like Eva Green. She played amazingly in Proxima, Penny Dreadful, Sin City, and Dark Shadows, but this show it's a miss for me. Showrunners have been looking for someone french-speaking and mysterious looking to fit the screenplay, and I got it.\n\nVincent Cassel is also a miss for me. I liked his performance in the Oceans and the Black Swan and tolerated him in Westworld, but now I want to skip him. He's not the super-agent mercenary type, not for my taste.\n\nThe first trailer was about someone hacking UK's infrastructure, causing chaos and a connection between Eva Green and Vincent Cassel. They share a secret and ought to work together to save the world. I was sold to see a different perspective.\n\nThe show started with a punishment. Usually, I don't watch tv shows with subtitles, but this time I had to. It might not be important to you, but it was a setback for me. \n\nRight after that, we see a hacker in an abandoned building in Damascus, aggressively typing on a keyboard. At the same time, we are introduced to the first plot device of this show - the star-shaped thumb drive that will have no meaning other than moving the plot forward.\n\nThe whole \"puss in boots\" plot got me excited for more. I was expecting the show to give me an explanation, to make a sneak peek of the hacker behind it, but nothing happened. Puss-in-boots hacker died that very second with minor remarks about it later in the show. \n\nWhy would Vincent open a safe with loads of cash in the middle of the party? Right, the plot needs him to. And now we know he is not a spy or a secret service agent because he asked about DGSE ([Directorate-General for External Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate-General_for_External_Security)). His task is to extract the hackers and bring them to France while drunk. \n\nThe moment I saw Stanislas Merhar aka Didier Taraud I thought \"this sneaky guy is onto something\". Sad to admit that I was right. The show is doing nothing to hide it. \n\nAlso, when the show wants to be technical, they fact-check everything, as mister Robot did in all of the hacking scenes. Otherwise, they will sound technical but have no meaning. For example, when the head of the Brit's Cyber Security Office said they had a temporary backdoor into their DMZ, I laughed. A DMZ stands for \"demilitarized zone\". Its sole purpose is to add an extra layer of protection to the internal network. And it means that by getting into the DMZ you won't be able to hack the internal network and make a video play on all of their computers, but I get the theatrics. I liked that Eva was not happy in that scene. I was not happy when I heard it too.\n\nBut, I admit, seeing Eva Green playing the executive of the British government and her duo with Peter Mullan kept me entertained and somewhat invested for two episodes.\n\nWhen Eva and Vincent met somewhere in the city, I was shocked. He's a wanted man, and Eva works for the government. No one is watching after them or following them. Like what? They just told us that the government is using CCTV to track Vincent's character and Eva knows that. But meets him in the middle of London. Right, they are hidden in the trees and CCTVs are blind.\n\nHonestly, I was expecting a dynamic tv show with hackers, spies, and betrayal, but it's a spy soap in the eye of the storm type of a show. If you like soaps and drama-driven narratives, you might like Liaison.",
