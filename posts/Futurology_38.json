        "text": "I might be wrong here. That's why I'm posting this, to see if anyone have anything interesting to say about this phenomenon. I am open for critics about my thoughts. Because I'm not claiming them to be facts. Just abstract ideas.  \n\n\nAnyway, the concept of an AI winning in the chinese game \"go\" against the worlds best go player Lee Sedol isn't really impressive to me. And let me explain why.   \n\n\nThis AI, as the name tells artificial \"intelligence\" is not actually selfe aware nor has the capacity to think for itself. This works from a pretty simple algorithm as shown in this documentary published my DeepMind: [https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y](https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y)   \n\n\nIt works by having a huge memorybase, basically the concept of a huge harddrive, with a very large amounts of scenarios which exceed any human memory potential. I do not find this that impressive. If you think about it a little, it's just like how any computer works.   \n\n\nWhen you start a program on your PC/Mac or whatever you use, the contents needed for the program to launch, (the files) is retrieved by the system compontents. Primarily RAM and CPU. Then the files run  and show the picture of the program on your monitor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis concept has been around since the 1980's. Although with a much lesser memory capacity than today. \n\n  \nMy thoughts is that this isn't actual intelligence, just very impressive memory capacity. I do not say that this is a bad thing. But you can't really call it \"self thinking\" when the robot's algorithms are just checking it's memory base and executing the right move to win that particular scenario. And that \"path\" is programmed by a human.   \n\n\nI might have misunderstood the whole thing, which is fine. Then please tell me where I am wrong. This is always a very interesting subject to talk and share ideas about.",

        "text": "Let me start this off clearly by making a few things of note:   \n1. I'm not against AI art  \n2. I'm fully aware it \"Can't be removed\" at this point  \n3. I'm here for a civil discussion from both parties, not a pissing contest    \n\n\nGood? Okay. Oh, and this might get a bit long.  \nI'm a digital artist, in particular, an aspiring animator  \nI see no inherent problem with AI art, my reasons of which I will get into. That being said, it doesn't mean that it's without its issues, especially regarding the rights of actual human artists. I've seen a LOT of debate online from both sides of the conversation, and as someone who's somewhere that's a bit in the middle on this, I figured I could answer and/or rebuttal some common questions and topics that I've seen repeatedly after reading several posts from people.   \n\n\nMy current viewpoint on this topic is this: It's a good tool, but not in the way it's being used right now.  \nAI art has the potential to be a useful tool. For artists ourselves, while it doesn't replace our work, it certainly helps the thumbnailing and conceptual process. I've done a few experiments myself, and there is a certain inspiration that comes from looking at abstract blobs of colors and unresolved concepts that can often be spit out by most AI software. Besides that, it does have some potential for streamlining certain processes outside of just the art field.   \n\n\nThat being said, there is no opt-out button for human artists. I know the first comment someone will say is \"Well it's your fault for not reading (insert big-name social media platform's) TOS. They have the right to sell/data mine your art.\" This isn't true, and we'll get into it later. For now, just bear with me. At its base level, if you create something, it is yours. Regardless of where it's posted, it belongs to its original creator. So, the problem here in lies data mining. What's on the internet will inevitably get passed around the internet, regardless of the ethics. Even without AI and bots to do this, its human nature to steal and claim artwork that doesn't belong to them. However, not only does this take business away from actual, hard-working artists, it's quite literally illegal (in most countries, anyways.)\n\nBut now to answer and rebuttal some questions and topics, from both sides.   \n\n\nTo the AI fans:   \n\n\n1. \"AI is going to replace you anyways, so just accept it.\"  \nI've seen this line passed around way more times than I'd care to be happy with. No, AI cannot and will not replace artists. The reason for this is very simple. AI can only replicate a pattern it's been trained to see. It cannot evolve passed the baseline that's been set for it. Before someone says it, yes I'm aware that AI is in its infancy. However, at the end of the day, it is a product of human knowledge, and it is a product with a limited capacity for information. Yes, a computer can hold more information than a single human brain can- you can always add more storage to a computer when you can't for a human, that is a given. However, a computer can't process the same amount of information to the same extent in the same way that humans do. Because of this and their inherent pattern-based learning method compared to experience-based learning, they cannot and will not exceed human capability.   \n\n\n2. \"Well it's your fault for not reading the TOS.\"  \nWell, actually, no it's not. You see when anyone agrees to the TOS of any social media or media sharing site, while we often do agree to have our data sold to third parties in this process, this applies MUCH differently to intellectual property and copyrighted works. After all, if anything on the internet could be used with reckless abandon, all of those music artists on youtube wouldn't be doing so hot right now, would they? And to those who want to argue that making art doesn't make you its rightful owner and that if you post it online it's \"public domain\"-  \n\" \\[Y\\]ou need to know that copyright is an ‚Äúautomatic right.‚Äù [Copyright](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf?loclr=blogcop) automatically protects your work from the moment it is fixed in a tangible form. In other words, once you create a piece of art, write a story, or write down or record a musical composition, it is protected by copyright. You don‚Äôt need to do anything else at all for your work to be protected. Your work just belongs to you after you make it.\" Pulled from the Library of Congress (Here's the link for those that need it: [Article](https://blogs.loc.gov/copyright/2020/09/what-i-wish-they-taught-me-about-copyright-in-art-school/)).  \nOh, and to those who want to argue that TOS can take away copyright, let me remind you that just because you agree to a bunch of legal jargon on a screen, it doesn't necessarily mean they can just do whatever they want. If there's a clause that says they can kill you, it doesn't mean that they can actually legally kill you. The same logic applies here because they can't own the copyright to a piece of work just because it was posted on their platform. They can own the right to publishing, however, this right isn't used and is only included in their terms of service because if they didn't they could basically be sued for any post ever regardless of its content. Even if a newspaper company is leant the rights, lawyers still advise against using artists' posted works in the first place because most courts will still rule in favor of the artist regardless.  \n\n\n3. \"Just switch to traditional art if you're so scared of having your artwork stolen.\"  \nFirst of all, maybe don't steal in the first place. Second of all, this doesn't exactly work in the way you think it does. For those who haven't made art before, all artistic mediums have a limitation. Watercolors will always be less saturated and more free-flowing, acrylic will always dry way too fast to properly blend it, oils take days to dry in between layers, graphite is restricted to its gray color and little variety of texture, charcoal will always be messier and unruly, colored pencils will always have limits to their blending and style, alcohol markers will always bleed- have you noticed a pattern? All art mediums have limitations, and not all of them are meant for every artist. We don't all use the same materials and draw in the same way. In this sense, traditional mediums will never be able to fully replace the style, speed, clarity, and unpredictability of digital art. Digital art takes just as much time and skill to create as traditional art, don't undermine it just because we use a computer in the process. Besides that, just like how anyone can Ctrl + C a digital piece of artwork, what exactly is stopping anyone from going to a gallery and taking pictures of the work, and posting it online as their own? And if you're going to say the cameras and guards, I can promise you as someone who's visited many a museum, that isn't going to stop jack shit.   \n\n\n4. \"It's just pretty pictures, why are you complaining so much?\"  \nI know this percentage of the population is a bit rare, but I still feel the need to make it a point.  \nArt isn't just pretty pictures. Trust me, if all of the artists in the world one day just decided to up and quit one day, society would crumble. It's seriously not just a cultural thing or an artistic thing- quite literally every single modern-day thing is built on a foundation of art. Don't believe me? Every building? Designed by an architect- a type of artist. Advertisements, logos? A graphic designer. Clothing? Yeah, even the basic shit was designed by a fashion designer. Amusement parks, computers (Yes, engineers are also a type of artist in their own right, plus don't forget someone had to make those pc's look pretty so you'd buy it), websites- literally everything we use and own was at some point in the hands of an artist. We're complaining because our work isn't just pretty pictures, it's hard work that quite literally runs this planet.   \n\n\n5. \"If you don't want it stolen, don't post it.\"  \nOne, it's my intellectual property, if I want to post it I have the right to do so including the right to not have it stolen and then shoved into AI to create lower-quality copies of my work that will be sold by some AI dude-bro online that thinks putting words into a generator makes them an artist and gives them the right to sell the work. Artists don't condone tracing, and that includes when it's done by a computer.   \nTwo, most modern-day artists regardless of if they are traditional or digital artists require social media to get recognition. Artists have to fight for people's attention and commissions in order to make enough money to live. Telling us to get off of social media, the single biggest and most important aspect of growing any business in the modern age is the equivalent of telling millions of small businesses to just stop existing because someone else will steal from them. You wouldn't tell a pizza parlor to stop selling pizza or advertising their pizza because someone will break in and steal the recipe or their money. Instead, you'd call the cops on the thief for stealing what doesn't belong to them (well, I assume most normal people would do this).  \n\n\n6. \"AI art is better than real artists anyways, you should just quit.\"  \nYeah, you're right- if you're comparing to beginners and studying artists. The funny thing is that humans learn a bit slower than mass-producing pattern recognition software. We can only put out one painting every few hours if we're really, really pushing it. AI can put out a couple of thousand images in that amount of time. There's absolutely no doubt about that. That being said, many of the artists being compared to AI art are teenagers and students in the process of learning. Generally speaking, experienced and master artists will beat AI 100% of the time. Why? Because a human artist can recognize flaws and correct them through time, patience, and practice. AI art can only replicate the same mistakes within its dataset and coding and even at times make them more obvious. After all, this AI stuff isn't exactly as intelligent as some people like to let on, and in reality, it can spot its problems because it isn't aware of them. Yes, in the future we can probably tell the program not to give the human an extra arm coming out of his chest, but it won't correct the composition, lighting, or color of the artwork. It won't change its proportions and technical qualities of it. Thus, I have to say, while AI can beat some artists who are on their journey, at the end of the day it will still fall short of actual humans. Oh, and AI can't make proper animations or housing blueprints yet and probably ever, so I think we're winning.   \n\n\n7. \"But if we can't use copyrighted images on the internet what can we use?!?\"  \nThis is pretty simple, try the millions upon millions of free-to-use stock and common-use images that are all over the place. Better yet, the library of congress has an entire library of images for free use including artwork that now belongs due to the public domain either due to age or due to its owner had put it there. You don't need to steal from living breathing artists to do the same things you're doing now, you're just choosing to.  \n\n\n8. \"You can't copyright and art style.\"   \nYou're right because art styles are inconsistent. That being said, we can copyright the art that we make that's being used to train AI and prevent it from being used in ways that we feel are unethical or from being used without our consent. \n\nOkay now that I've finished the AI fans, here are my comments for the artists:   \n\n\n1. \"Will I get replaced by a robot?\"  \nNo. Like I said before, AI can't now or probably ever replicate the true skill and nuance human artists have. Art isn't something that a computer can replicate, because computers don't have emotions, unique though, or the capability to create genuine new concepts in the same way humans do. They can't process concepts to the same degree or level of skill humans do.   \n\n\n2. \"Should I give up being an artist because it's better than me?\"  \nIf this is where you draw the line, you were never going to make it far to begin with. There was always be someone better than you, someone, you look up to or resent. This doesn't mean your work is bad or less valuable, it just means that you still have learning to do. An AI might be better than you now, but it doesn't mean you should just quit, because you can easily one day meet or exceed AI capabilities.   \n\n\n3. \"Is AI our mortal enemy?\"  \nI phrased it like this on purpose because that's what artists treat it as. No, AI is not your mortal enemy. In fact, we already use some of this, like when we use the select tool in clip studio. Hell, just taking an image for reference nowadays is influenced by AI that corrects colors to be more life-like or sorts your images into folders for you. The point is, it's a tool when used properly, but a weapon when used incorrectly. Just like everything else. A pencil is a really good writing utensil until you stab someone in the eye with it. Then it becomes a murder weapon. Don't be the person that goes \"All AI bad\" just because some people use it incorrectly.  \n\n\n4. \"AI is stealing money that's rightfully ours!\"  \nYeah, you're right. I really don't have too much argument about this, but I will say one thing. Unfortunately, there will always be people taking advantage of our work, whether it's through guilt-tripping into free commissions or using it in ways that it wasn't intended. I know that many people pay to put food on the table through freelance work and I'm not saying it's right to steal the work of said artists. Just because it's the norm it doesn't mean we have to take it sitting nor should we, but we also have to choose our battles. We can't attack every single AI machine in existence because some people want to use it improperly, but we can push for our art to be removed from the great data miner.   \n\n\n5. \"Should I switch mediums or jobs because of this?\"  \nI mean, that's up to you but I really don't think it's necessary since AI simply can't replace humans and especially not at this point.   \n\n\n6. \"Should I remove my art from social media?\"  \nAgain, it's not really necessary. Remember too that just because you remove it from your social media it doesn't mean that it's gone for good. Someone already saved that image or posted it somewhere else. Digital footprints are regrettably eternal no matter what we do.   \n\n\n7. \"Tips to protect my art?\"  \nThere's not much you really can do, but if it's really bothering you, just add a watermark to your image with toyhouse levels of obnoxiousness. That should confuse most AI and frustrate most AI model makers. The only downside is, again, the obnoxious watermark. Some people already do that anyways, though.   \n\n\nWow, you made it to the end of this needlessly long post. Have a cookie.   \nIf someone has any other points they'd like to discuss or debate (hopefully in a civil manner) I'm more than willing to do so.",

        "text": "if you had to create new programming language and training model for ai to most quickly move towards general ai, how would it differ from existing languages and model? \n\nThere are many approaches that could potentially be effective in creating a new programming language and training model for AI to quickly achieve general intelligence. Some possible considerations that might be taken into account when designing such a system include:\n\n1. Expressiveness: The language should be expressive enough to allow the AI to represent a wide range of concepts and knowledge, and to perform a variety of tasks.\n2. Efficiency: The language should be efficient, both in terms of the resources required to execute code written in the language, and in terms of the time required to train the AI using the language.\n3. Scalability: The language and training model should be able to scale to very large data sets and complex tasks.\n4. Interoperability: It may be desirable for the language to be interoperable with other languages and systems, to allow the AI to interact with a wide range of existing tools and platforms.\n5. Human-friendliness: The language should be easy for humans to read and write, to facilitate the development and debugging of AI systems.\n6. Flexibility: The language and training model should be flexible enough to support a wide range of learning algorithms and approaches.\n\nIt is likely that any new language and training model designed for this purpose would need to incorporate a number of advanced features and capabilities that go beyond those found in existing languages and models.\n\nüì∑üì∑what advanced features\n\nThere are many advanced features that might be included in a new programming language and training model designed to help an AI achieve general intelligence. Some examples of such features might include:\n\n1. Strong support for symbolic reasoning: Symbolic reasoning is a type of logical reasoning that involves manipulating abstract symbols to deduce new conclusions. A language that supports symbolic reasoning could allow the AI to perform tasks such as planning, theorem proving, and natural language processing.\n2. Support for probabilistic programming: Probabilistic programming languages allow users to specify probabilistic models and perform inference over those models. This could be useful for tasks such as decision making and prediction, where the AI needs to reason about uncertain outcomes.\n3. Support for learning from unstructured data: A language that allows the AI to learn from unstructured data, such as text, images, or video, could be useful for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.\n4. Support for transfer learning: Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that allows a model trained on one task to be fine-tuned for use on a related task. A language and training model that support transfer learning could allow the AI to quickly learn new tasks using the knowledge it has acquired from previous tasks.\n5. Support for multi-task learning: Multi-task learning is a machine learning technique that involves training a single model to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. A language and training model that support multi-task learning could allow the AI to learn multiple tasks more efficiently and effectively.\n\nüì∑üì∑tell me more about advanced symbolic reasoning\n\nSymbolic reasoning is a type of logical reasoning that involves manipulating abstract symbols to deduce new conclusions. It is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, and has been studied extensively in the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science.\n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, symbolic reasoning can be used to perform tasks such as planning, theorem proving, and natural language processing. For example, an AI that is capable of symbolic reasoning might be able to read a set of instructions written in natural language, parse the instructions into a logical representation, and then execute the instructions by carrying out a series of actions.\n\nThere are a number of advanced techniques that can be used to enhance the symbolic reasoning capabilities of an AI. These techniques might include:\n\n1. Knowledge representation: This involves representing knowledge in a structured way that can be manipulated by the AI. One common approach to knowledge representation is to use a logical language, such as first-order logic, to express facts and rules about the world.\n2. Reasoning with uncertainty: In many real-world situations, there may be uncertainty about the facts or the outcomes of actions. Techniques such as probabilistic reasoning and decision-theoretic planning can be used to reason about uncertain situations and make informed decisions.\n3. Natural language processing: This involves enabling the AI to understand and generate natural language text. This can be achieved using techniques such as parsing, semantic analysis, and machine translation.\n4. Planning: Planning involves generating a sequence of actions that will achieve a particular goal. Techniques such as heuristic search and planning graphs can be used to generate and evaluate potential plans.\n\nOverall, advanced symbolic reasoning techniques can help an AI to perform a wide range of complex tasks that require logical thinking and problem solving.\n\nüì∑üì∑humans also use symbolism to communicate the inexpressible. so we are not just talking about reason or logic. general ai would only be possible if it could move past pure reason and logical. tell me how that could be achieved\n\nYou are correct that humans often use symbolism to communicate ideas that cannot be fully expressed in words. For example, we use metaphors, art, and music to convey complex emotions, experiences, and abstract concepts.\n\nIn order for an AI to achieve a level of intelligence similar to that of a human, it would likely need to be able to understand and use symbolism in a similar way. This could involve developing an AI that is able to recognize and interpret symbolic representations of ideas and experiences, and to generate its own symbolic expressions in response.\n\nOne way to achieve this might be to develop an AI that is able to learn about the world through unstructured data, such as text, images, and video. This would allow the AI to learn about the symbolic representations that humans use to communicate, and to develop its own symbolic representations of concepts and experiences.\n\nAnother approach might be to develop an AI that is able to learn from its own experience and observations, much like a human does. This could involve giving the AI a sense of self and the ability to have experiences, as well as the ability to reflect on and reason about those experiences.\n\nUltimately, achieving general intelligence in an AI is likely to require a combination of many different techniques and approaches. Symbolic reasoning and the ability to understand and use symbolism are likely to be important components of this effort, but they are only part of the larger puzzle.\n\nüì∑üì∑how could ai have experiences?\n\nIt is difficult to define exactly what is meant by the term \"experience,\" as it can refer to a wide range of phenomena including sensory experiences, emotions, and abstract concepts such as beliefs and thoughts. However, there are a number of ways in which an AI could potentially be designed to have experiences in some sense of the word:\n\n1. Sensory experiences: An AI could be equipped with sensors that allow it to perceive the world in a manner similar to humans. For example, it could have cameras for vision, microphones for hearing, and touch sensors for tactile perception.\n2. Emotional experiences: An AI could be designed to have emotions in a way that is similar to humans. This could involve the AI having \"internal states\" that correspond to emotions such as happiness, sadness, or fear, and that influence its behavior and decision-making processes.\n3. Abstract experiences: An AI could potentially be designed to have abstract experiences such as beliefs, thoughts, and desires. This could involve the AI having a representation of itself and its environment, and the ability to reason about and manipulate those representations in order to achieve goals.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to predict exactly how an AI might be able to have experiences, as it will likely depend on the specific design of the AI and the capabilities that it is given. However, it is clear that the ability to have experiences of some kind is likely to be an important aspect of achieving general intelligence in an AI.\n\nüì∑üì∑arent beliefs, thoughts, and desires rooted in ignorance though?\n\nBeliefs, thoughts, and desires are all subjective mental states that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including personal experiences, cultural background, and individual biases. As a result, it is possible for these mental states to be based on incomplete or inaccurate information, and to lead to misunderstandings or errors in judgment.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that ignorance is not a necessary component of these mental states. Beliefs, thoughts, and desires can also be based on accurate and complete information, and can lead to sound judgments and decision-making.\n\nIn the context of artificial intelligence, it is likely that an AI with the ability to have beliefs, thoughts, and desires will be able to base these mental states on a wide range of information, including both structured and unstructured data, and will be able to update and revise these mental states as new information becomes available. This could potentially allow the AI to make more accurate and effective decisions, and to adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nüì∑üì∑take this scenerio:  if you had two computers and both started running the same general ai.  they were used independently for several years.  if you then started to ask them the same questions - would they give the same answers   \n\nIf two computers were running the same general AI and were used independently for several years, it is likely that they would give similar answers to the same questions, assuming that they had been provided with the same input data and that there were no significant differences in their operating environments.\n\nHowever, it is also possible that there could be some differences in the answers that the two AIs give, due to a variety of factors such as differences in the specific hardware or software implementations of the AI, or differences in the specific data that the AIs have been exposed to.\n\nOverall, it is difficult to predict exactly how two instances of the same AI would behave in this scenario, as it would depend on the specific design of the AI and the details of its operating environment.\n\nüì∑üì∑no. you already said that a successful general ai would go beyond logic and reason.  that means that over time the 2 general ai's would go off on their own paths.  youre assuming theres one right answer to all questions\n\nI apologize for the misunderstanding. You are correct that a successful general AI would likely go beyond pure logic and reason, and would be able to adapt and learn from a wide range of experiences and sources of information. As a result, it is possible that two instances of the same general AI, even if given the same input data and operating in similar environments, could eventually diverge and go down different paths as they encounter and process new information and experiences.\n\nIn this case, it is possible that the two AIs could give different answers to the same question, depending on the specific information and experiences that they have encountered and integrated. This does not necessarily mean that one of the answers is \"right\" and the other is \"wrong,\" but rather that the AIs have reached different conclusions based on their individual histories and the information available to them.\n\nOverall, it is important to keep in mind that a general AI is likely to be a highly adaptable and flexible system, and that its behavior and responses to questions may evolve over time as it processes new information and experiences",

So our lady that does payroll and also does the back ground checks for potential hires, gave her two weeks notice on Tuesday that she was going to be working for him. So we find out today by our IT guy that there is something being sent out every month from her email that says \"file synchronization\" directly to him since September and she deletes it. The first time she tried , it said it failed but then said it was successful and once a month it updates the sync and apparently resends the email. We think she had some kind of software downloaded to do this and our IT guy is going to try to figure it out but does anyone else have any ideas on what she could have been sharing that would be beneficial to him other than good candidates that pass a background check? We use microsoft outlook, QB and a CRM... Just trying to get some ideas or opinions on this",

That guy was bit weird coz he is freaking busy with his work and friends and he used to send me a GM txt and then in the evening, (What's up baby?) and then in the night (Just now came home baby, so tired). This is what his daily routine looks like. Even on weekends he did the same routine. Anyway i didn't think of it and let him do his jobs and we used to talk once he was free. Sometimes he used to ghosting me. on past friday evening, he called me and asked me for a coffee date. And he strictly wanted me to come alone even i didn't see him before as a person and this would be our first date. Im really scared to meet him alone coz i really don't know how good he is or what would be! So i told him that im not gonna come alone and my bestie will coming with me. and terribly he was ignored and asked me to come alone but my friend and i were f*** scared and we thought to go together coz i wanna meet him live and see him as a person badly. Then after few minutes he called me to check whether im on my way, on that time, my friend picked the phone and asked him, (hey if you don't mind, um coming with her, it is okay ryt?) then he replied (Can i talked to her?), so she gave the phone to me and he was upset and told me, (I thought that you're coming alone, okay then um not okay to meet you today) and cut the phone. Later on the same day night he texted me, said, i will stop talking to you! coz if cant meet alone then no use of talking. \nWhat i did is wrong guys? coz im really scared to meet him alone. and now we're not talking.",

        "text": "The entire bouquet of topics on this subreddit got me thinking one thing: most people are gloomy about most recent/new developments, but that is a chosen POV that I struggle to understand; so I thought I'd try and share my inner thoughts for some positivity. Let me explain with my favourite discussion in recent times: the uprise of AI Art/texts and the (mostly offensive) reaction of artist communities.\n\nFirst and foremost: discovery is inevitable. \n\nAI technology has been uncovered and is in the process of being applied, and just like photos, or modern digital filters transforming the way humans think, work, live.... This will change the general occupation of image artists from \"visualizers\" into \"refiners\" who may start from an AI basis and tweak it until it is suitable and \"re-inventors\" who seek novelty and new input (which AI will adapt), attempting to re-sort the trained noise into a new, artistically useful direction. In addition \"ai artists\" will surface / are here, which use the new \"brush\" to depict reality (much as with photography back in the day).\n\nYou may be sad about it, but the age of \"normal\" digital artists is over - we are talking about \"digital traditional art\" now. Emotions won't change anything about that and rage towards AI art is senseless. The technology itself is amazing, its use cases is difficult to assess with our current ethical constructs. But it is here to stay, and even if its advancement is limited i.e. by law, it will resurface and stay eventually - because it can be applied, and human curiosity will lead to experimentation in pursuit of optimization, resulting in technological advancement and societal development. (Another example would be how bioengineering was feared to be applied to create superhumans, now we apply it for medical treatments and supercrops in accordance to our current, adjusted ethics).\n\nSo you can look at new discoveries in worry, considering what might go wrong, how it can be misused, what problems arise, who won't be able to adjust etc.\n\nOr you can wake your inner childs curiosity. The world is vast and beautiful, and so are its endless possiblities. Isn't the thrill of discovering, shaping and applying the thrill of the unknown a huge part of the fun in life?\n\nDon't fear change, it's the only constant in our perceived reality. Embrace that nothing lasts forever and let that fact hit you with max impact. \n\nPerceive the flow of time, and enjoy the passage you are a part of. Don't fight it, and instead, ride along and enjoy the views - they are unique, after all!\n\nAll you know can change. You can change. And both will.",
