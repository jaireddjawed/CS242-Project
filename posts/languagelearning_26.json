        "text": "Hey, \n\nI'm 19 years old, from Germany, and I'm going to spend a year in India. I speak English fluently (kinda, at least) but it would be great if I could speak Telugu, too. But there seem to be very few resources. (I think I will have to learn Telugu through English, because there is just one German book, and that does not seem to be good...). The only book I found that seems ok to me is \"Spoken Telugu for Absolute Beginners\". Do you know if it is any good? It costs 40€, so I don't want to buy it only to find out it won't help me. Are there any other good books or quality online resources you can recommend? \n\nEverything is appreciated, also general tips on how to approach learning Telugu. \n\nTo the mods: I understand that posts about single specific are generally not exactly welcome. But I was not able to find something good myself, although I put quite some effort in my search. There is one sub regarding Telugu, but it's not very active, and earlier questions about learning resources did not produce really helpful answers. \nAlso, the only internet adress in the resources section of the languagelearning sub that links to a real language course seems to be invalid... \nSo I hope this post is ok (I have no Idea what else I could do to find resources). If not, I'm very sorry.",

However, my listening scores were utterly abysmal compared to my grammar and vocabulary sections. \n\nThis makes sense as 99% of my studying involves grammar and reading. I'm honestly not too sure how to engage in listening practice beyond just watching videos in my TLs. It can be very frustrating as I feel very lost when doing this and it's hard to stay engaged.\n\nFor those of you who are B+ in your languages with good listening comprehension, how did you hone your skills? Can you describe what you did to increase your listening abilities?\n\nThanks!",

I found that the orthography of French was a bit too much for me to learn at this time, though I want to return to it.\n\nAs a language lover, I really want to learn Italian. I don't think there is any way I will be able to take an Italian class at my college, just given my schedule. As a result, I need online resources (preferably free– but if it's really effective, I'm fine to pay) to learn the language.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for a path to fluency– or conversational-level proficiency– for someone with very little time (as in, I can't do it every day)?\n\nThanks.",

Characters, I can somewhat enjoy it, grammar - no way.\n\nSo how far can intuitive way get me? Also, I don't plan to do any exams, it's for daily usage only.

When I say \"B1\" I mean that I scored B1.3-B1.4 on an online placement test, [https://pruebadenivel.cervantes.es/exam.php?id=17](https://pruebadenivel.cervantes.es/exam.php?id=17). True it does not test conversation but conversation is most of what I've been doing via the subscription service and I think I feel pretty comfortable speaking even if I am not perfect.  \n\n\nIn addition to grammar/listening/reading/writing/and speaking exercises through this service, I have read some children's readers and use Anki to review verb conjugations.   \n\n\nI just feel stuck. I'm wondering if I should dedicate more time to reading and watching videos and less time to using a tutor at this point. To tell the truth, listening is the most difficult basic skill for me at this time. Speaking is much easier. And I need to know more vocabulary. Also I wanted my tutor(s) to help me through reading a particular book and one of them said it was \"too advanced.\" I would rather just plow through it though.  \n\n\nFor those of you reading this post and who have already gotten to or beyond the B2 stage of your language, how much time each week did you spend with a tutor in the B1 to B2 bridge? If you had only 2 hours a day to study how much time would you spend with an online tutor? I really do not know how to use my tutor most efficiently.",

Well, it's bloody expensive to do those tests as a student, and I didn't want to take a Goethe exam while dealing with a full university courseload.\n\nAnyhow, I plan to take the C2 German exam on the 7th of May, which gives me exactly 100 days including today to prepare for the C2 exam.

My battery's low, can I plug it in?\"\n- the broad category of \"physical things you do to objects\": to pick something up, to take something out (of a cabinet, etc), to keep something, to leave something (e.g. \"I left my keys at home\")\n- the broad category of \"things your brain does\", e.g. \"come up with\", \"find out\", \"imagine\", \"think of\", \"come to mind\". It probably doesn't help that in English, many of these are phrasal verbs that are unlikely to come up in word frequency lists.\n- transition words: my college German textbook didn't teach me \"additionally\", but it made sure to teach me \"pre-retirement plan\"!\n- prepositions / particles that are per-word: I was taught \"weather\" but not \"in this weather\" (surprise surprise, German doesn't use \"in\" here)\n\nOn the flip side, here are some things that weren't as useful as advertised:\n\n* personal hygiene and chores\n* transportation (maybe more relevant when traveling?)\n* holidays (you only need these words once a year)\n* the environment and pollution???? This topic has been covered while I was learning TWO separate languages - coincidence or do intermediate courses just love to talk about pollution? lol\n\nWhat are yalls thoughts?

I barely focused on grammar/vocab except when I first started so I could have a little bit of a foundation but it was just to get familiar with some verbs and basic vocab, since I was starting from scratch.    \n\n\nI can understand Spanish Con Juan, How To Spanish (though some of the videos my comprehension is a little lower) and Spanishland School/Espanolistos. I can read some B1 material depending on the subject with minimal lookups but I haven't fully started reading yet as I wanted to wait until I was closer to 1000hrs. I also haven't really jumped into native content yet either. I can understand some things if I really focus but it's still not enough where I would feel comfortable solely watching native content.   \n\n\nNow the issue is that when I take these tests, I do somewhat poorly on the sections that require you to fill in the blank sentences with either a multiple choice or to put in the missing word(s) myself. And even though I can read some, I still don't know the full meanings of everything together and I don't know exactly what would make the sentences right.    \n\n\nBased on this, where should I focus my studying on if I want to be able to increase my understanding and level for these types of questions/sections?    \n\n\nI can answer any questions that may help to further assess my weak areas.

        "text": "Hello. \n\nI did read the wiki before creating this post. This is a long post.\n\nI grew up hearing southern Vietnamese being spoken by my family/neighbor. However, until 2021 I hardly knew anything at all in Vietnamese as the times I did learn, we would only learn the basics and younger me would never get it (due to a combination of youth immaturity on my end and how I only had class once a week at the temple and of that it wasn't consistent). By the time I was a junior in university, I ended up taking an intro Vietnamese class and I learned more than I did in the past 7 years before I entered university. The initial goal was to talk with family but I learned the hard way that they would say very basic stuff and nothing very complicated. \n\nOne example of this is when I talk to my dad:\n\n\"throwaway, Mấy giờ?\" \n\n\"năm giờ bốn mươi.\" \n\nOr another thing: \n\n\"throwaway ăn chưa?\" \n\n\"ăn gài\" \n\nI notice that I can have short conversations, but anything longer I struggle with so I notice that I will need to start talking to native speakers (for me that would be going to groups with Vietnamese speakers and making an effort to talk to them in various topics), learn more vocabulary. I also noticed that I need to try and make an effort to use the words that I learned, otherwise I forget them or mix up the accents. I would like to get to near fluency to the point I can talk to native speakers about most things. \n\nRight now as of this post I am doing:\n\n\\- Italki lessons with a Vietnamese tutor for 1 hour a week \n\n\\- the 2nd part of the Vietnamese intro class (I would of taken it already, the problem is that I had to do classes for my major that prevented me from taking it until now) \n\n\\- I am on a discord server and I read the messages/memes they send \n\n\\- listening to Vietnamese music/videos \n\nWhat I plan to do: \n\n\\- try to find native speakers to talk to \n\n\\- try to learn and retain words I use \n\n\\- try to better my pronunciation (the tutor helps a lot because of the feedback) \n\n\\- eventually try full immersion in Vietnam (how I do this, I am not sure) \n\n\\- I would like to try and learn Vietnamese to around b1/b2.  \n\n\\- Ideally, I would like to up the italki lessons to twice a week from the once a week (once a week is all I can afford, hopefully I can have the time/money to do lessons twice a week). \n\nSometimes I doubt my ability to speak Vietnamese, I feel I am speaking it badly but when I went to a club with Vietnamese students at my university, the two people I talked to said that it is good for someone that was born in the US. I do understand more of what my parents/people say and the same for videos/music compared to the past. I am not sure if I am missing anything and some pointers would be nice.",

I've studied a little bit of both simultaneously, but I just don't have time to actually pick much up from both at the same time. So I want to narrow it down and funnel my language learning resources into one language. I don't *need* to learn either of these languages. It would be purely for fun. Little bit of background: my grandfather came to the US from Ireland when he was a kid. He spoke Irish and English, but refused to speak Irish once he got here. In his memory, I wanted to learn Irish. On the other hand, I am fascinated by Chinese culture and the language. I think both languages would be equally difficult to learn. Irish for the lack of resources, and mandarin because of the difference to English and the new writing system. Also tones are hard. I know mandarin is more useful, but I'm really torn because I really like Irish too. Help me out and choose for me!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/10mt4cr)",

        "text": "Let me preface this with saying, that of course, you might not be able to follow a movie in your TL without subtitles without. Maybe you just need more practice.  \n\n\nBut I see watching movies/series recommended often in here, so I wanted to share my experience. For years, I felt kind of ashamed of the fact that I struggled to watch movies without subtitles (in TL) and I've both questioned if my level was lower, than I thought it was, and judged my level lower than it probably was in hindsight.  \n\n\nA year ago, I came across the term **audiotory processing disorder** (APD), and BAM, things made sense. APD basically means that even though you hear just fine, your brain have trouble interpreting speech and making it into words you understand the meaning of. This it not related to language learning. If you've APD, you also feel this way in your NL.     \n\n\nThings that makes movies hard to understand, which makes them even harder to understand for someone with APD:  \n\n\n* Background noise/sound effects/sound track  \n\n* Changes in volume - fx loud sound effects while speaking with a low volume\n\nMy listening comprehension level is currently C2 in English, and while I can watch a movie without subs, it costs me a lot more energy, and if someone else is talking/making noise in the same room, I cannot follow anymore. Same thing happens in my NL.  \n\n\nThat this was not an English-thing but a movies-are-hard-to-listen-to-for-me-thing took me until my mid 20s to realize, because I haven't been watching many movies in my NL. So I thought the problem was a language learning-one even though it's not, and isn't solved by typical language learning-strategies.  \n\n\nGood news is, there is other ways to strengthen listening comprehension if movies doesn't work for you/is really ineffective for you for above reasons. The two main ones I use is:  \n\n\n* audiobooks. You get to listen to a good book, and you can find narrators with lots of different accents and who speaks at different tempi.\n* podcasts. You get more everyday language and train listening to people speaking over each other.\n\n  \nIf learning by watching movies is working for you, of course, don't change it. This is primarily something to consider if it's *not* working for you.\n\n  \nSome questions to ask yourself, if you are wondering whether you just need more practice or APD may be at play:  \n\n\n* Can you somewhat easily follow movies in your NL without subtitles?\n* Can you still focus on dialogue in movies, if someone else it talking/making noise in the same room?\n* Do you often find yourself saying \"what?\" only to get what they said 5 seconds later without needing it to be repeated? Your brain just needed a bit more thinking time? (again in your NL)\n* Do you have trouble following a conversation in you NL in a noisy environment?\n* Do you have trouble following group conversations in your NL?\n\nAPD is more prevelant among neurodiverse people than among neurotypical.",

It does not work for me when it comes to actually learning to speak proficiently.\n\n6 months after starting college, during my exams I started using Duolingo again for Japanese. Since I study Japanese, I don't need duo to learn anything, but the lessons really get me into a mindset perfect for studying. A couple of Duolingo lessons are a fun way to switch my mind to Japanese so I can start doing actual work. I've been having so much fun with it, even muting my phone so I can practice reading faster. The UI is easy on the eyes and the sentences they give you, especially in the \"People\" or \"Feelings\" categories make me laugh. It's kind of like playing Minecraft in Japanese except I don't have a constant fear of dying to an エンダーマン!\n\nI reset my progress when I started college so I'm yet to reach stories. I miss them being available all the time but the lessons are so easy that I'll get them soon enough. My personal favorite is the one about Bea's \"girlfriend\" lol\n\nAnyways yeah those are my thoughts on Duolingo. Bear in mind I had a 200 day streak before starting college and it didn't make much of a difference for me aside from knowing Kana. This just shows that it's not great for actually learning.",

        "text": "Hello everyone, i would like to share my approach of how i am learning German in the hopes of reaching Fluency and finally taking the C1 exam if possible by the end of the year. MY GOAL FROM THIS POST is to get advice from advanced learners on whether my approach is good or i need to adjust some things. I. Studying 3 to 5 hours a day depending on free time and mood.\n\nWhen i first started, APRIL 2022,  i wasted 3 months finding out what works for me. Until i made up my mind on sticking to assimil and anki-ing every word. \n\nI found that working on active recall took twice as much time and slowed me down. So halfway through assimil i focused mainly on passive recall and throughout my journey i found out that the more i review these words and come up across them when reading, they started to feel more like second nature and i could recall them. (Often frequent words).\n\nI didn't do much listening practice, i found that even when reading,my comprehension was slow and had to read several times and really focus to get a meaning. Listening to the advanced assimil lessons  i was able to only get the gist and overall idea.\n\nAfter being done with assimil, i found out that i couldn't read anything or even watch anything in German due to lack of vocabulary, even though at hat time i had learned all assimil vocabulary+ extra and had around 3k words and sentences on my anki. This is where i opted to reading+anki only. \n\nSo nowy approach is reading only, and anki ing every unkown word. I read up to this day, 29 graded readers A2 LEVEL. at the beginning, few pages would take me 3 hours, going slowly and looking up 40-60 unkown of words every 3-4 pages or so. \n\nAt the moment,after 2 and a half months of daily reading, i am even able to skim through A2 readers text fast and harvest 1 or 2 unkown words per page. I am satisfied. \nIn a few days i will finish reviewing assimil then switch to reading b1/b2 readers, and i have about 6k anki  90% words and expressions which i have harvested from reading. AND I WAS SURPRISED, assimil audios became easily distinguishable and understandable even the last difficult lessons... With barely any LISTENING practice...\n\nMy plan is to keep reading,\" please note that German is easy to pronounce, and i have already good grasp on pronunciation, i also check every unkown words pronunciation before adding it into anki \"until b2 readers start feeling natural and facing minimal unkown words, then keep reading but only 10% of my time, but focus on input from media and dubbed content while working on a grammar book along with that to solidify my knowledge.\n\nAs for speaking, i do 1 hour a week with a penpal. I plan to up that when i feel i could follow conversations without being held back by unkown words. German is complicated with plenty of synonyms and has dozen ways of saying the same thing.\n\n\n\nTldr: acquired a good grasp on basic grammar and pronunciation by working on assimil. Then switched to only reading+ anki every unkown words, basically only intenive reading until i would be able to read fluently B2+ texts while facing not much unkown words. Then switch to media  input and work on a grammar book to solidify my grammar knowledge. I do 1 hour speaking every week with a native speaker.",

Besides, I never fit in with the locals due to being mixed.\n\nI was fluent in Greek up until age 6 when my parents pulled me out of kindergarten and refused to expose me to the language. I have studied Greek in school but they didn’t have intermediate classes so I could never progress. I was always stuck in beginner because I wasn’t fluent enough to be in advanced with native speakers.\n\nI also barely had time to study either of the languages to the fullest due to focusing on my studies in English and now I’m severely lacking in both. \n\nI really want to learn Greek again, but don’t know what to do.

I’ve hung out with locals and spoken with them for extended periods of time. My Spanish is not amazing, it is still gringo accented and my grammar is imperfect and I don’t always know the right words, but most people understand me just fine. \n\nEXCEPT in tourist areas. I feel like relatively frequently in super-super touristy areas (currently in a town on Lake Atitlan that’s chock full of backpackers) people act like they can’t understand me, repeat what I said to make sure it’s actually what I meant, or just straight up switch to English. I just ordered coffee in Spanish and the guy looked at me quizzically and made me repeat myself, and then repeated the order back to me in English to make sure he got it right. I have had no issues like that in random towns where few foreigners go and nobody speaks English, but places like this have me second guessing myself.\n\nI noticed this in France as well a few years ago. My French is, again, not perfect, but I studied it for my entire childhood since I was 5 and I can get around okay. In small towns in France and Belgium I could speak in French and people understood me, but in Paris and Lyon people would sometimes give me funny looks and switch to English. \n\nIt can’t be that my Spanish/French is actually that poor that nobody can understand me — right? Otherwise how have I been communicating just fine with people who don’t speak any English this whole time? \n\nIf it was just that they were switching to English I would understand although it might hurt my ego lol. But people seem to legitimately be unsure of what I’m saying sometimes, in a way that I don’t get in places where I’m the only gringa. Is there something psychological where they don’t understand because they’re primed to expect me to speak English and the Spanish is just not computing in their head? Or is it on my end somehow, does my Spanish get acutely worse when I’m surrounded by spoken English? \n\nHas anyone else experienced this, on either end? Or know what’s happening? It’s so frustrating, I can be in small towns and non-touristy cities and feeling confident and then I come somewhere like this and feel super dumb.",

However at work my colleagues are mostly speaking in Dutch. I have also French native friends at work. I am studying French by myself and I don't even look at Dutch. Because I read somewhere that 2 languages at once is not a good idea. On the other hand I don't want to lose opportunity at work hearing Dutch all the time. I am at the beginning in French as well. So confused right now. Anyone who had a similar problem?",

        "text": "Hello! \n\nI am a native English speaker from Canada who did all of their schooling in French growing up. I started in preschool, so age 3, and all of my friends spoke French natively so I could almost argue French was my \"first\" language as I only spoke it with my mom at home and nowhere else. (Later on I was put in remedial English lol)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it's been about 10 years since I left and I haven't used it at all with the exception or reading manuals/signs/packaging if the English wasn't immediately obvious and annoying my bf by not needing subtitles for French shows on Netflix.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I am starting to look for jobs in a new field where having French is a big asset (or at least it is on the JD). Reading is mostly fine, I'll get 80% and fill in the blanks. If someone speaks to me in French and I already roughly know the topic I'm ok (movies visuals clues etc) and speaking is an absolute dumpster fire but they always know what I'm saying and I'll get a big laugh. (Example I can't remember horse so I'll say \"That big pretty animal on a farm\"). But once I use a word I've forgotten once, it's easy to recall. IT'S ALL IN THERE, it's just not accessible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my question is what is the easiest way to bring it back? My initial thought was just doing a bunch of reading to trigger the memories for vocab, but what about speaking?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBonus points for anything that won't interfere with my Croatian studies. I'd really hate to pause it to catch up on French.",

Problem is...I am not Italian, have no Italian friends, hardly any friends IRL, and just my husband who is not Italian. I don't plan to travel for fun internationally, and I think I am only liking the IDEA of knowing Italian fluently. I ask myself all the time...but for what purpose?! To impress people you don't even know or don't know yet, and for what end goal? \n\nI keep sitting on the idea/desire to learn Italian, and I'm sure if I WANTED to, I could knock it out of the park, as I've done with my other languages (where people end up assuming I'm like a bilingual speaker or have lived in that language's country for a long time). \n\nI just want this idea/desire to learn Italian to STOP TORMENTING me, and I just want to move on with my life and stop thinking, oh what if you learned Italian? Oh what if you became fluent and could converse with gosh knows who?? \n\nThank you in advance for any advice or support.",

However, there’s a trend I’ve found - *other than English*, Europeans seem really likely to say they “speak” a language just because they learned it for a few years and can maybe understand a few basic phrases. I can speak French fluently, and I can’t tell you the amount of non-Francophone Europeans I’ve met who say they can “speak” French, but when I’ve heard they are absolutely terrible and I can barely understand them. In the U.S. and Canada it seems we say we can “speak” a language when we obtain relatively fluency, like we can communicate with ease even if it’s not perfect, rather than just being able to speak extremely basic phrases. Does anyone else find this? Inspired by my meeting so many Europeans who say they can speak 4+ languages, but really can just speak their native language plus English lol",
