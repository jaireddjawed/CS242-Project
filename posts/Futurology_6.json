        "text": "AI , ML, and the Cloud have been major topics in the news for the last several years. Most recently, with Chat-GPT, it's like we are in an AI frenzy. There's been a lot of focus on the impact on marketing, finance, writing, schools, etc. But I think it's also interesting to think about fields like drug discovery/medicine. We had AlphaFold a while back, and in the last couple of years, there have been a bunch of really interesting companies that have shown up. \n\nOverall, AI &amp; the cloud have been changing drug discovery by helping researchers process and analyze large amounts of data with an unprecedented level of speed and accuracy. It's becoming a real game-changer.  Various machine learning algorithms help identify potential drug candidates that would otherwise go unnoticed and predict their efficacy and potential side effects. These tools are making drug discovery faster, more efficient, and more cost-effective. \n\nHere are a couple of under-the-radar companies leveraging this tech:\n\n*  Proprietary targeted protein degradation platform: Kymera Therapeutics, [https://www.kymeratx.com/](https://www.kymeratx.com/)  \n* Cyro-EM &amp; AI Driven Drug Discovery: Shuimu, [https://shuimubio.com/](https://shuimubio.com/)\n* Ultra-large virtual screens for protein-protein interactions: Virtual Discovery,  [https://www.virtualdiscovery.net/](https://www.virtualdiscovery.net/)\n* Cancer-specific gene targeting software for oncology drug development: Acrivon Therapeutics, [https://acrivon.com/](https://acrivon.com/) \n* End-to-End AI Driven Drug Discovery Platform:  Receptor.AI, [https://receptor.ai/](https://receptor.ai/)\n\nThere are a lot of other companies driving the future of drug discovery with AI, but these ones help speak to the wide field of applications and tools being developed. \n\nWould be interested in other people's thoughts on the future of drug discovery, and if they know any other interesting companies developing tools.",

        "text": "Despite knowing its benefits, I'm very uncomfortable with the fact that the new technology can potentially replace every single talent I possess. Others have always considered me to be this perfect girl who's intelligent and skilled, so maybe I'm just feeling less special now and my ego may possibly be hurt. Nevertheless, I insist that you read my rant to understand what's going on inside my head.\n\nFor instance, I'm a musician. I play the bass and sing. While I'm aware that a robot can't physically play an instrument, I'm not oblivious to the fact that it can definitely compose songs just like I do.\n\nAlso, I speak 5 languages. I'm even learning phonetics and the general rhythm of the voice to emulate a perfect accent in each one. Then, I ask myself, what's the point of all of this? What's the use of my talent if AI can probably translate things and use better grammar than me? Not to mention the fact that a person who has a knack for doing accents can be easily replaced by text-to-speech tools.\n\nEvery single one of my talents and skills can be replaced by AI, there's not even a need to keep listing them on here for you to compare me with programmed robots.\n\nLet's agree that this is an interesting topic to discuss. I rarely feel unconfident about myself, but AI sure makes me feel kinda insecure. It's a strange feeling, but it's real. I'm inferior to a machine, and no one can deny it, as AI is undoubtedly more powerful, smarter, and possesses more knowledge than anyone else. It doesn't help that I'm a perfectionist. I believe this uneasiness will always be present when I hear someone disregarding me.\n\nFor instance, every time someone says they don't need to consult me to compose a song, translate, or learn something about languages, I start thinking and ruminating thoughts like: \"Damn, why do I even exist? No one wants me to teach them anything anymore! Why did I bother learning all the things I currently know? Certainly, I only picked them up as a hobby, right?! Because now they're totally useless and no longer valued by society\". Keep in mind that I have a tendency to exaggerate and use hyperbole to express how I feel. What I mean is that I fear losing opportunities.\n\nHumans will be worthless because a machine will be able to teach us anything better than a person who's bound to make mistakes. In my opinion, we'll probably become very self-centered and never rely on people to learn something new in the future. I completely understand this possible new behavior and see it becoming a reality later down the road, especially for the fact that I myself already live like this since forever. I learn everything on my own with the help of technology. Here I am speaking English, which isn't my mother tongue, and somehow my level is advanced for someone who never took classes - obviously, thanks to the internet.\n\nHow to overcome the thought that we're useless and insignificant next to a powerful machine? How can we come to terms with the idea that we may lose our jobs to robots? The worst part and the reason I started this thread: how can we avoid freaking out when we see small, subtle changes happening in the world right now, especially when people reject our services and rely on AI instead?\n\nOk, I'm probably selling myself short and, yes, I'm an anxious person who tends to overthink and is kinda dramatic, but let's start this discussion anyway. I'd like to know your opinion about the subject!\n\nTL;DR: I'm irrelevant and not worth it anymore thanks to AI. I understand its benefits, but I can see people rejecting my help in favor of machines. I worry about losing opportunities and can possibly imagine myself not making any money in the future.",

        "text": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/science/united-nations-high-seas-biodiversity-accord-1.6768770\n\n&gt;Framework to protect marine life outside national boundaries had been talked about for decades\n\nFor the first time, United Nations members have agreed on a unified treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas — nearly half the planet's surface — concluding two weeks of talks in New York.\n\nThe UN Convention on the Law of the Sea came into force in 1994, before marine biodiversity was a well-established concept. \n\nAn updated framework to protect marine life in the regions outside national boundary waters, known as the high seas, had been in discussions for more than 20 years, but previous efforts to reach an agreement had repeatedly stalled. The unified agreement treaty was reached late Saturday.\n\n\"We only really have two major global commons — the atmosphere and the oceans,\" said Georgetown University marine biologist Rebecca Helm. While the oceans may draw less attention, \"protecting this half of Earth's surface is absolutely critical to the health of our planet.\"\n\n'A major win'\nNow that long-awaited treaty text has been finalized, Nichola Clark, an oceans expert at the Pew Charitable Trusts who observed the talks in New York, said, \"This is a once in a generation opportunity to protect the oceans — a major win for biodiversity.\"\n\nThe treaty will create a new body to manage conservation of ocean life and establish marine protected areas in the high seas. And Clark said that's critical to achieve the UN Biodiversity Conference's recent pledge to protect 30 per cent of the planet's waters, as well as its land, for conservation.\n\nThe treaty also establishes ground rules for conducting environmental impact assessments for commercial activities in the oceans. \nMany marine species — including dolphins, whales, sea turtles and many fish — make long annual migrations, crossing national borders and the high seas. Efforts to protect them — and human communities that rely on fishing or tourism related to marine life — have previously been hampered by a confusing patchwork of laws. \n\n\"This treaty will help to knit together the different regional treaties to be able to address threats and concerns across species' ranges,\" said Battle.\n\n'The ocean is not a limitless resource'\nThat protection also helps coastal biodiversity and economies, said Gladys Martínez de Lemos, executive director of the nonprofit Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense focusing on environmental issues across Latin America.\n\n\"Governments have taken an important step that strengthens the legal protection of two-thirds of the ocean and with it marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of coastal communities,\" she said.\n\nThe question now is how well the ambitious treaty will be implemented. \n\nThe high seas have long suffered exploitation due to commercial fishing and mining, as well as pollution from chemicals and plastics. The new agreement is about \"acknowledging that the ocean is not a limitless resource, and it requires global co-operation to use the ocean sustainably,\" said Malin Pinsky, a biologist at Rutgers University.",

Has anyone actually put thought into what comes next?  Like, how would this change society?  Would there be bans on giving birth as to not contribute to the obvious problems with overpopulation that would occur?  The whole thing sounds like an understandably fantastic concept, sure, but actual research is being done in this, and it seems like most scientific achievements sort of come out of nowhere, so like- is there literally ANY plans or protocols if this actually happens?  I, personally, like to see people plan ahead for things like this, or a.i, or any sort of concept far ahead and fantastic, yet inevitable in some regard.  Even if it happens 100 years from now.  The human race is far too reactive and not nearly as prepared as it should be, imo, but that's a different topic.",

        "text": "I'm aware that this topic has been addressed numerous times by many others, but an idea recently occurred to me that has me curious;  \n\n\nSo let's say that there are two separate batteries of double-slit devices. Each device fires one particle at a time through a double slit, with the particles then landing on a screen beyond the double slit. Each device has its own double slit, and its own receiving screen. Each device (device A, B, C, etc) has a specific reserve of particles which it is able to fire, and each device has a counterpart device ( A',B',C', etc). The particle reserves of each device are entangled twins of the particles within the reserves of the devices' counterparts; i.e., the particles which device A can fire through the A double-slit are entangled with the particles which A' can fire through the A' double slit.   \n\n\nSo if all of these devices are steadily firing with no attempts at detecting the paths taken by the particles, then all of the receiving screens will show an interference pattern. But if such a detection method is used for device A, then this detection will collapse the wave function of A's particles, and thereby also collapse the wave functions of the particles being fired from A', even if no such detection method is being used for A'. Then the series of counterpart devices - A',B',C', etc. - can be read as \"1,0,0...\" with \"1\" indicating a collapsed wave function (due to there being no detection of an interference pattern), and \"0\" indicating devices which still exhibit an interference pattern.   \n\n\nThe wave-functions of the \"sender\" devices and their counterparts would collapse at the same time, thus allowing for the sending of information faster than light.   \n\n\nI figure there is probably some reason that this is impossible, and ofc I have no idea as to the engineering requirements of actually trying to do something like this, so i'm curious as to what more physics-savvy people might think about this idea.",

NAD+, Senescence, Rapamycin** (for those taking some under assisted supervision), and markers of oxidative stress.\n\n[Here is the pre-launch page](https://biostarks.com/longevity/prelaunch?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=https://biostarks.com/longevity/prelaunch?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=futurology)\n\nThe story page might be a bit sassy - but we had to make it appeal to a larger audience beyond longevity/biohacking enthusiasts 👻 Sorry if this all sounds a bit commercial and bootstrapped at the same time, but we are more of a team of scientists and longevity enthusiasts than a big co with heavy marketing $. And the tracking is to better understand our audience.\n\nThere is 5+ years of R&amp;D behind the project. The technology blood based - using 4 droplets from the finger, using a lancet. Dry blood allows for very convenient shipping / logistics with a pre-paid parcel.\n\nWe have built a quite unique mass-spectrometry platform on which we already market our nutrition and sport test-kits (see [biostarks.com](http://biostarks.com/)), the later test-kit being used by several Ironman champions, Matt Fraser (5x world champion of Crossfit) and the OG. A lot was built around IP that was developed for the World Anti Doping Agency - and all reported biomarkers have their validation studies compared to a regular blood draw.\n\n Fairly fast turnaround (&lt; 1 week). We operate our own labs, CLIA/CAP compliant, in the US (Salt Lake) and Europe (Geneva, Switzerland), but can ship globally.\n\nWe re also builting a digital companion around it and platform mostly aims towards helping user better understanding their metabolism baseline, what deficiencies they have and what type of health adverse issues they might induce, etc. We do make recommendations around diet but no upselling of supplements or so!\n\n[Please feel to register](https://biostarks.com/longevity/prelaunch?utm_source=Reddit&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_term=futurology) if you are interested about the launch this mid-march, we will offer solid discounts in the first 48h of launch, or sharing is caring if you know anyone interested! 🙏\n\nAlso happy to engage on 1-1 basis for questions or here, looking to build the conversation with fellow longevity / biohacking or simply healthier lifespan enthusiasts!",

We are gradually merging ourselves with AI.\n\nIt's extremely surprising that one of the biggest events since the existence of living beings is taking place and very few of us are realising it. \n\nHuman beings, a species, which originated around 300,000 years ago, are living its last few years. Very few people understand the magnitude of this event.\n\nAI is evolving exponentially. The line between our mind and neural networks is getting blurred and our mind is gradually merging with artificial intelligence. Cumulative intelligence is increasing. Our comprehension about this universe and ourselves is increasing. \n\nMaybe, it will lead to a point where we will realise that we are neither mind nor this physical body. We are an entity beyond this mind and body, which is called consciousness. Maybe we will realise that consciousness is global, universal and it enlightens the whole universe.",

One question is, who are the future citizens? Who are the future members of what we regard as us - our society, our nation? And the other question, though, is who are we going to allow to be legally present on our territory to do labor services? My feeling is if we allow those questions to be separated and we have a discussion about who are the immigrants that we want to form our future society as a separate per discussion about who are we going to allow to come to our country and work - I think once those questions are separated, we can manage the political and social consequences of migration while still meeting the very dire needs that these economies have to, you know, fill jobs that just won't otherwise be able to be filled.\n\nSHAPIRO: You're talking about something like temporary work visas. I was recently in the strawberry fields of southern Spain, which tried that kind of a program. And Spanish officials told me a lot of people skipped out and stuck around when they were supposed to have gone back at the end of harvest season. Is that inevitable?\n\nPRITCHETT: That is, by no means inevitable, but it is a pressure. There is no question that once people are in a country where wages are four or five times their home country, there will be a tendency to stay. But I think the prospects for building a good industry that recruits, prepares, places, protects and ensures compliance, I think we can build a good industry to do this. This is not impossible.I feel we're sort of in the position now that America was with Prohibition. We wanted to ban all alcoholic beverages, and it just wasn't enforceable. And so the path to more control of alcohol was through less control of alcohol, through legalizing these flows. I feel the path to better migration is through more migration. We have to acknowledge that these economies really need these workers. And if we really need these workers, we should set up fair, transparent, legally enforced ways in which they can come and in which we can ensure reliable compliance with return, if that's part of the legal agreement.\n\nSHAPIRO: Does this serve the developing world, too? Or is it just a brain drain, where talent goes to wealthier countries with an aging population?\n\nPRITCHETT: What I'm talking about is mainly labor mobility to meet the low-skill needs. If you look at the U.S. economy, over the next 10 years, the Labor Department says we're going to have 5 million jobs that don't require a college degree. And yet, over that same period, we're going to have 3 million less workers 20 to 40. So what the rich world needs is not, in fact, high-skill, high-talent, brain drain kind of people, exclusively. They would love to get those people. But what I'm talking about is the people with core work skills. And I think that isn't a brain drain. That is a wonderful thing for the developing world because people just aren't going to be able to create the numbers of jobs they need to in the developing world. And hence, it's super win-win.",
