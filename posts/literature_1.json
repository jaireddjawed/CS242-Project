It seems like this is such a saviors act, to spare her, but really i think the pity is even worse than the shame, to save her through such unscrupulous means. \n\n\\*\\*\\*SPOILERS AHEAD\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe fact that in the end, this ploy meant nothing because she leaves him who tried to \"save\" her out of pity only to be murdered by the man she left him for, what type of cruel karma. It really stuck with me how he didnt cry and only felt terror and horror. They way that fear smites tears here was such a tender description of emotions. Even more sadly, he ends up back at the asylum because of the way he couldnt cope with this trauma, the love really does make us mad, he chose duty over himself how tragic is that.",

        "text": "This would be a difficult book to review! I started it in Feb and re-read the first 30 pages thrice before diving in further.\n\nI'll try to be as honest as possible and avoid being a pretentious literary aficionado who tries to forcibly read classics. Unfortunately, I might be the latter though. Let's set it straight, I have seldom enjoyed reading classics. They feel long and slow and sometimes too simplistic. But then one might ask why I keep going back to them. With the limited number of days that one has on earth, shouldn't one read what he enjoys?\n\nI read to explore more than to enjoy. I want to know what's special about Ernest Hemingway, I'm curious as to why \"The Old Man and the Sea\" is considered to be an undebatable masterpiece. In this process, I might find myself judging the greats but I find satisfaction that I have read something which is considered a pillar in literature.\n\nComing to another reason as to why I trail back to classics, the aftermath is always great. I read a classic and post a few days come across interpretations and video essays and sometimes my own thoughts that make me realize that there was something special about the book!\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea bored me up to 3/4th part, there I said it. But as I neared the conclusion, I felt sad that it was going to end. I don't have those literary interpretations and solutions to metaphors that experts grace us noobs with. But I have a feeling that the book made me aware of human emotion in a way that not many books could. And I respect that, period.\n\nHemingway paints the picture by leaving a little to the imagination, reading his prose is like watching a film scene. Such is its vividity! The book got dramatic towards the end and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It motivated me to write my own modern adaptation someday. Would you think of re-visioning something that bored you for most of the part? Well, I would need to ask myself that question constantly.\n\nWhat are your interpretations and reviews to TOMATS and classics in general?",

        "text": "David Wong Louie‚Äôs ‚ÄúDisplacement‚Äù (1989) is a portrait of a complex woman living a simple life. Mrs. Chow is a Chinese-American immigrant living in California in the 1950s. Though she is the daughter of a wealthy family in China, she makes a living by tending to the needs of a demented old woman. \n\nMrs. Chow speaks and understands much more English than anyone assumes. She reflects on her family, and is certain her parents are long dead at the hands of the People‚Äôs Army (the Communist Revolution is well underway). Her husband, Mr. Chow, is the grounds man of the widow‚Äôs estate - they work there for the perk of free rent. \n\nThe old woman becomes increasingly senile and lashes out at Mrs. Chow for slights real and imagined. Mrs. Chow decides that it is time for her and Mr. Chow to find a space to live of their own - at least to live away from the daily abuse. \n\nThe Chows have a weekly ritual of going to the nearby theme park and riding a large rollercoaster. Mr. Chow is afraid of heights and doesn‚Äôt find this tradition enjoyable, but the ritual is important for Mrs. Chow. She likes the feelings the roller coaster brings, and the weekly ride seems almost cathartic to her. As with most things in life, Mr. Chow obliges her, despite his own sensibilities. \n\nThe Chows go out to visit an apartment they have found - the landlord is a worn out mother of two small children. As with everyone, the landlord assumes only Mr. Chow can speak in English, so the communication happens around her. Almost immediately, Mrs. Chow is out into a subordinate role as the landlord hands her a squealing baby to deal with while. Mrs. Chow is not maternal and has to remind herself how to appropriately hold a baby. \n\nIt brings the reality crashing down on her that her lot in this life with Mr. Chow in America is more or less set. She is viewed as either an enemy or subordinate in this place. It will be assumed she cannot speak English. She is damned to serving old wenches and small children. She goes to ride the rollercoaster for a familiar thrill, but it is instead replaced by fear. \n\nQuotable: ‚ÄúAnd for the first time Chow thought he heard her, she who loved this torture so, scream too‚Äù.\n\nPS: happy Saturn return to all my astrology enthusiasts! Be gentle with yourselves!",

        "text": "\nI've been thinking about the *nouveau roman* recently--the high modernist, or \"neo-modernist\" avant-garde novels (or \"anti-novels\") written in France in the 1950s and '60s by writers such as Alain Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor, Nathalie Sarraute, etc. \n\nAs far as I can tell, there have been two distinct phases of the movement's influence on English-language literature. The first and more focused one took place in the '60s and early '70s and included writers like Ann Quin, B.S. Johnson, Christine Brooke-Rose, Susan Sontag, Robert Coover, etc. This is partly covered (for the UK) in Adam Guy's *The Nouveau Roman and Writing in Britain After Modernism* (2019). However, a second and more diffuse phase can be found in writers strongly influenced by the nouveau roman since the '80s. These would include Lydia Davis (who wrote her undergraduate thesis on the NR), Paul Auster, Nicholson Baker, and Tom McCarthy.\n\nIf you've read some of the works mentioned, are there any other English-language writers, especially since the '80s, you would include in this second phase along with the four I mentioned, and if so, why?\n\nTo get things started, I can see a fainter but still distinct influence in a writer like Siri Hustvedt, where however we can sense a kind of \"renaturalization\" of NR conventions, probably as a result of the exigencies and pressures of the American publishing industry. (And of course the biographical connections of Davis, Auster, and Hustvedt are also a factor here.) This would lead to even more diffuse influence in something like Ottessa Moshfegh's *My Year of Rest and Relaxation*. (The direct influence of the NR on Moshfegh is not obvious, but she did publish a short narrative in 2021, with an art-book press, called *My New Novel*, which might be an intentional acknowledgement of this.) In any case, it's this kind of diffusion / dilution that I'm particularly curious about.",

One minute everything is fine and the next they're convinced everyone around them is loathsome and their relationships are over and their loved ones are in love with someone else. Levin throws a guy out of his house cos he thinks his pregnant wife is in love with him. Kitty is in floods of tears cos she's decided that Levin's in love with Anna - a woman he met once, briefly, in the company of her brother. Kitty and Levin are newly weds with a baby on the way - how are they this insecure? \n\nAnna falls out of love with her own son when she returns after first meeting Vronsky. She alternates between being obsessed with seeing her son and not even caring about him. She and Vronsky develop this obsessive love which drives him to a suicide attempt, fuels her morphine addiction and of course ends in her killing herself. The final straw it seems is her idea that he's in love with someone else - all based on the flimsiest of circumstances. Vronsky is much more emotionally stable - he's going through a lot but he doesn't seem to have the same rapid change of emotions and jealousies as the others - even though he's seeing a married woman. \n\nThey're all repeatedly convincing themselves that the people they love hate them and are desperate to get away from them. Why? Do all these people have some personality disorder? Is this some form of psychosis? Who behaves like this? \n\nIt's not even as if this is normal behaviour for their time or their society - there really aren't other people behaving like this. Everyone else seems pretty stable emotionally. But Anna, Kitty and Levin all change moods in flashes.",

        "text": "In Italy, this kind of attitude is reserved only for the sommo poeta, Dante Alighieri, hailed by most as the greatest poet and writer of all time. To me, this sort of excessive praise seems to be odd and is caused more by ignorance and some sort of nationalistic connotations, a remainder to the time of Chauvinistic Europe and this attitude towards writers, which in the end become some sort of competition, is one of its last echoes (Similarly in the anglosphere there is a some sort of excessive worshipping towards Shakespeare). \n\nThere are 192 countries (maybe more) in the world and countless languages and countless cultures, each one with their own philosophies and aestheticism, and if you haven't read their best works, how can you even compare which is the best? Even if you have, on what criteria would you base it? How would you compare the Mahabharata, Shahnameh with divine comedy, each being product of their cultures at their specific time and needs.  \n\n\nI wouldn't ignore the people that helped foster this kind of environment are the various literary critics and writers (Romanticist in primis). If you only live and breath one culture, one literary tradition, how can you even compare the masterpieces of different cultures(H.Bloom in nutshell). To me it seems like some sort of autocongratulation, since behind this push rather than literary merits there is mainly historical reasons and politics. If you think about in the world where the lingua franca of the world would be Persian, for example do you still think Shakespeare would still have been called \"the greatest writer\" by many? Would he maintain this sort of idolatry without the romanticist? I don't think so, instead it would be shifted towards some Persian writer. Dante himself was excluded by the Italian canon for centuries in favour of Petrarch and Bocaccio and only during the unification that he was chosen as symbol of Italianness.   \n\n\nTlrd: Bardolatry is bad concept and have some sort of chauvinistic connotations and many people, who are into it, doesn't have much exposure to the world literature in general, thus having a pretty narrow views in general. By world literature i mean beyond the anglocentric or eurocentric type of canons. Literature is not a race or competition and this kind of idolatry is unhealthy  overall.  \n\n\nThis is my personal opinion. I apologize for eventual grammar mistakes, since english in not my native language.",

I enjoyed it, but I didn‚Äôt find anything special about the writing and I thought the movie was significantly better. \n\nNot bashing Crichton at all, I liked the book a lot. But just found his writing perfectly fine. Not bad, but nothing special. I did enjoying the book though, quite a bit. \n\nAre there examples of the opposite of this? Where the storytelling might be subpar, but the writing is good, or even great? Be it the syntax, or grammatical usage, or just the prose?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "I've spent years (on and off) searching on Google, trying to track down a story that not only recently resonated with me, but it also helped me to better understand myself in so many ways and overcome a big obstacle in my life. \n\nThe story gives off hints that it is set between the 50s and 60s, but it was about a Filipino immigrant who arrived in California, I think. The story is narrated by a friend who also emigrated, and he details how goofy his friend is acting because he is new to the country and tries so hard to \"be an American\", but he just can't fit in. At one point in the story, they both loose touch for many years because they are picking fruit on farms, and people are constantly being moved around California to other fields. Towards the end of the story, they come in to contact again, and the narrator sees that his friend has finally understood what it means to be an American. The narrator's friend has joined an organization that seems to be something like the United Farm Worker's labor union and has become an activist for immigrant farm worker's rights \n\nNow that I think of it, it could be around the time of the Delano Grape Strike, but I can't remember.
