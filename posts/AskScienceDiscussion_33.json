Dams get a lot of energy from falling  water. This would be a reverse-dam, so would likely take a ton of energy  to pull off, but given that solar thermal energy is abundant in the  desert and wouldn't require much transforming/transporting, I wonder if  there might be a way to make it work. I'm also a bit concerned about if  things could actually grow in the \"soil\". There exist other areas of the  world with lots of life and lots of heat, they all have lots of water  but I'm not sure what other limitations there are. I'm also not sure  about how long the water would last. It would probably need to form a  river of some kind to avoid evaporation, but even if it does evaporate,  from what I remember of thermo, that would actually cool things down I  think, which might actually help in it's own way.\n\nDoes anyone know if this has this been tried/thought of before?",

        "text": "So, during the past months, I got myself into discussions with flat earthers (don't try this at home), because I was fascinated by the way they operate and wanted to learn more about how they think. In the end, I ended up even more confused.\n\nIt's seems like whatever evidence or argument you can provide, they'll manage to misinterpret it or find some rationalization as to why you're wrong.\n\n\nSome of the observations I've made during these discussions:\n\n- Try to convince them using general scientific knowledge -&gt; you get \"it's all lies and indoctrination\"\n\n- Try to convince them with photos -&gt; you get \"they're all fake\"\n\n- Ask them to list objective criteria they used to judge whether the photo is fake -&gt; you get no coherent answer, or no answer at all, they still continue believing it's fake\n\n- Ask them to provide a photographic evidence that supposedly proves flat earth or supposedly disproves the globe. When you get the photo, ask them how they know the photo is not fake -&gt; you get no coherent answer, they still continue believing their photo is not fake and it can be used as objective evidence.\n\n- Try to convince them using math. Use the geometry of Earth, Moon and Sun to predict sun motions on the sky or lunar eclipses using nothing but high school math to demonstrate that science has the power to predict -&gt; their rationalization - \"sizes, positions, orbits, rotations of Earth, Moon and Sun were all 'adjusted' that way so the math would seem like it works, but in reality the earth is flat\"\n\n- Use math to show that Sun movement as flat earthers portray it is completely incoherent with what we all see in the sky every day -&gt; you get \"you can't do calculations like that, we still don't know enough about the Sun\".\n\n- Ask them to make a prediction based on a flat Earth model of Earth and sun movements -&gt; they're unable to provide anything, but they still continue to believe Earth and Sun move like that.\n\n- Try to convince them using an observation- for example, observing how a far-away boat \"sinks\" below the horizon. -&gt; They'll find you a video that films a small boat that's so far away it's 1 pixel wide, then it'll zoom in and say \"see? boat is not below the horizon, it's just far away\".\n\n\nI once looked at a Youtube watch history of a flat earther. There was some music videos, and the rest of the videos were nothing but dozens of Flat Earth videos as far as the finger can scroll. The guy doesn't watch anything on Youtube that doesn't have a \"FE\" prefix attached to it. There's this horrible self-reinforcing loop that these people enter where they just consume flat earth nonsense and refuse to even consider anything else.\n\nIs it possible to break a person out of this? Is it possible to convince them somehow? Do you know anyone who turned away from these BS beliefs?\n\n\nAre there any good books where one might learn more about the psychology of these obviously false beliefs that get cemented so heavily into peoples minds?",

This caused large areas to become uninhabitable, due to both the fallout and the kaiju's blood. This repeated multiple times until it was decided that humanity needed a new weapon against the kaiju. Humanity built a prototype jaeger that was never supposed to see combat, and thus had no real weapons, yet the pilots were able to use it to kill a kaiju anyway. More research was done, huge weapons were designed, and the jaegers evolved into more or less the ultimate weapon, far surpassing any vehicle the military had thus far produced, to the point of being able to survive a point-blank nuclear blast with seemingly little difficulty.\n\nI haven't watched the sequel (on account of it being awful), but it looks like that once the kaiju were defeated, humanity kept improving the jaegers because they were still far superior to any other vehicle\n\nHow believable is this?",

So how can one go about justifying the existence of mechs in a particular world, both physically and research-wise? (after all, you need a pretty good reason for why humanity now emphasizes giant robots instead of tanks)\n\nEDIT: These are some thoughts I had, but I know they're probably bogus because I'm not a scientist. Anyway, it crossed my mind that the military could start researching mechs out of a need for a highly-versatile weapon that packs the firepower of a nuke, but without the negative drawbacks and can be used to fight only what needs to be fought and nothing else. Because of this, new technologies are developed, tech with a higher proportional output but can't be miniaturized, like a powerful reactor, vastly superior servos for movement, or a large particle weapon. New materials, combined with a better understanding of engineering and force distribution, help to solve problems like the Square Cube Law. Results are promising. Over time, the mechs become a better option for combat, and attention is turned away from tanks.\n\nJust a few thoughts. Are they bogus?",

        "text": "In pop physics books it’s common to hear about an anthropomoprphized photon who, because it is moving at light speed, experiences no time due to relativity. The moment of its emission and absorption is, to it, the same moment.\n\nWould this mean that light is proof of determinism? If a photon that was emitted millions of years ago from a star strikes my eye tonight, it was, to that photon, one and the same moment. From it’s vantage point, there was no time in between the two endpoints during which it’s org could have been deflected or interrupted in any way. Does that imply that from the moment that photon was emitted all those millions of years ago until the present, there was no other place I could have been because the photon had to enter my eye, due to the simultaneity of its lifespan, relative to its perspective? \n\nOr is it more like a Back to the Future thing, where a change can be made, but the photon never “knows” about it. It’s just as if the universe was always like this.\n\nLet’s say the determinism bit is true. If so, does that mean that some far flung corner of the universe that might, for some reason, be absent of light, might not be bound by determinism? Is there freedom in the dark?!",

And it would seem like a huge coincidence if all these species evolved the same sensory organs and they organized them the same way.  So does that suggest we share a common ancestor?

        "text": "The popular view among theoretical physicists seems to be that free will as it is popularly defined, ie that we are in control of our actions and that things might turn out differently based on what we decide to do, is an illusion. The particles that make up our body are governed by physical laws and move and interact based on those laws, and have no opportunity to be directed by us. There is no mechanism that would allow for it. That makes sense to me.\n\nSay that I then feel totally disconnected from my previous sense of agency and become a nihilist. I stop doing anything, or I do whatever I want heedless of consequence. This is where I am stumped. Did I decide to become a nihilist? It seems like without having learned about this disconnect, I wouldn’t have lost my sense of agency. But the particles that make up my mind and body are blind and indifferent to what I know or don’t know. Ostensibly I have become a nihilist because of their complex, minute movements and it just happens to work out that first the arrangement of particles in the world led me to this discovery and then, withtout deaign, led me to nihilism. \n\nThe same seems to even extend to simpler aspects of subjectivity. Say a tiger walks out of the woods. I see it and feel fear. But why? Yes some light enters my eyes, and ostensibly my brain interprets the information and responds accordingly. But again, this information is not changing at the movements of my particles at the quantum level. Certainly information is not a force that can move individual atoms and molecules, right? So how does any outside phenomenon at a greater than quantum size actually register? I can only suspect that it has to do with some kind of emergent processes, but even still. It seems like information entering my brain shouldn’t have any direct causation to what my brain does, if my brain is indeed unable to affect anything.\n\nAm I missing some huge piece of this puzzle? Physicists and neuroscientists please chime in! ",

        "text": "Possibly a bit of a strange question, but evolution is a simple principle at heart - that traits and behaviours which give organisms a higher probability of being able to procreate will be favoured over those which give them a higher probability of not being able to procreate. A simple example would be the tendency of small mammals to run from things that they perceive to be dangerous - those who were not disposed towards that behaviour would get killed at a higher rate than those who were, fewer would pass their genes on, and so we end up with a population that tends towards running from danger.\n\nWe tend to think of natural selection in terms of dealing with the natural world, but there are examples of evolutionary adaptations to things which are man-made. For example, there is a strain of the Flavobacterium bacteria that can digest the waste products of nylon manufacturing.\n\nOne thing that anybody who has driven a long distance knows is that you will end up with dead insects on your vehicle's windscreen. So we could put it that cars and lorries are one predator of insects, at least from the point of view of the insect. If a portion of the population of one species of, say, fly developed a trait that meant that they didn't fly over roads - perhaps they avoid the heat signature, perhaps there's something about the colour that they develop an aversion to, perhaps something about the smell - it seems possible that this trait would be selected for and eventually you may end up with a new species that avoids roads entirely.\n\nThe main thing I can think of against the idea is that flies generally have a very short life span, and they breed in the thousands, meaning that perhaps vehicles simply aren't enough of an evolutionary pressure for a trait which avoided them to make much difference. But then I think that evolution is about tiny, tiny changes accruing over many, many generations and wonder whether it actually matters how small the impact would be. Perhaps even a probability of surviving long enough to pass on its genes that's a minuscule amount higher would be enough to see that trait become dominant within a population, given enough time.\n\nSo, assuming that roads and traffic remain as ubiquitous as they are, or become more so, could we one day see a species of insect that will fly anywhere other than above a road?",

Now, there's two ways a more conventional laser weapon can cause damage. \n\nOne is the \"heat ray,\" a laser powerful enough to cut through or burn through whatever's on the receiving end (like human skin). \n\nThere's also the pulsed energy projectile (PEPS), an old US attempt at a non-lethal/less-lethal riot weapon from the early 2000s. The PEPS also appeared in the Deus Ex reboot, Human Revolution and Mankind Divided. The PEPS basically uses lasers to create a plasma shockwave that knocks down anyone on the receiving end. \n\nThere's been a lot of advancements in optics and lasers in the last few decades. It may be possible the Chinese company independently (or not...) re-engineered the technology from the PEPS, or simply optimized a handheld heat ray (a scaled up version of the fire-starting \"laser guns\" already made by some hobbyists). We won't know until there's more information, a demonstration, and/or it gets debunked. \n\nNow, what might be the energy requirements for a heat ray vs. PEPS?

We all know how much energy a star releases and we humans as of now cannot use or conserve it however, an more advanced civilization might be able to use the energy of the Star. And for that very reason that civilization created Black Holes. These black holes basically are like Nuclear plants, which absorb the energy and the star whole by itself and then transmits the energy to their planet where they can use it or their own purposes.

        "text": "So me and my friends were talking about what we want to do with our bodies after we die. Most of the people I was with were into the idea of a natural burial where they can be easily recycled back into the earth, however as they were talking about this I got an interesting idea: If I were to create a coffin with 10 inch steel walls and fill it with an alcohol like formaldehyde, I could theoretically be preserved for millions of years, my cells still existing as I'm buried beneath layers of sediment. This means when humanity falls and a new intelligent species takes our place, they could find my sarcophagus and possibly recreate humanity using my cells (assuming they have developed cloning). I also thought of putting in some supports into the coffin to help combat the immense pressure, maybe even adding positive pressure on the inside of the coffin to even out with the negative pressure from the earth's weight.\n\nI know this all sounds like scifi nonsense but I'd like to know whether or not this could work in practice, and if so, how long would you reckon I could last until either the earth's pressure crushes the case I'm in or my DNA radiates beyond replication. Thank you for your time.\n\nEDIT:\nTurns out formaldehyde corrupts DNA and only lasts ~100 years before it's antiseptic properties are nonexistent, so it's not really a viable option.",

        "text": "Hiyah Reddit!\n\nI want to get myself into medical research field, but really unsure how to get there. I don't really plan on ever being a physician but I want to get a proper medical education, so I though about getting an Associate Degree in Medical Assisting and then applying into Medical School. Or should I just pursue Bachelors degree in some science field and look for research opportunities while getting higher education? Biomedical Engineering major looks the most fun there.\n\nSENS Research Foundation is my biggest inspiration so far!\n\nAny opinion is highly appreciated!",
