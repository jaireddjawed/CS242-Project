I used to go down the night before on the train as it was £70 and stay in a hotel nearby for around £90. We get our expenditure reimbursed in our salary. Not bad really.\nOne day work decides that overnight stays for one day conferences are banned as they want to save money.\nI told them how that wouldn't work but they said \"just go on the morning train!\"\nSo I booked my £230 train ticket that left Manchester at 6.30am... But I don't live in the centre and to get to Manchester train station for 6.30am I had to get a £15 taxi each way as the local trains aren't running yet. When I get to London I have to get a taxi again to get to the conference on time. That's £20. Plus they had to pay for my breakfast which was included in my hotel previously.\n\nAnd since I've been up since 5am I don't remember a single thing that happened at the conference as I was knackered.

        "text": "Way back in elementary we had juice boxes galore. The school pretty much provided them for breakfast and lunch. At the time no specific trash bin was placed around the school for recyclables so we all just threw them in the regular trash can. In comes one of the adult volunteers(AV now for short) that absolutely no one likes. All they do is supervise us when we’re out playing during the breaks and when we’re eating lunch. So the AV sees one of us throwing away the juice box in the regular trash bin and calls the kid out on it. \n\n“Hey! Pick that back up and throw it in the recycling. That goes for the rest of you too. I don’t want to see anymore recyclables in the trash bin. They need to go in the recycling.”\n\nEveryone knew that there wasn’t an actual recyclables bin so instead everyone threw their recyclables in the PAPER recycling instead. The thing was that a lot of us didn’t finish our drinks and would throw throw them out without emptying them. So for the next two or so days everyone had to deal with pungent juice and paper despite the fact that they were emptied daily. The best part, everyone reverted back to throwing recyclables in the regular trash bin at the same time as though we  all nonverbally agreed to screw AV over. \nOh yeah, and she wasn’t the first to do this, nor was she the last.

        "text": "After graduating college I took a summer job as Waterfront Director for a summer camp. They were desperate for someone to fill the job. The director let me know I could have free use of the boats on off hours and even agreed to pay me more for travel. I was thinking of taking another job but the friendly appeal tricked me into thinking this might be a rare opportunity.\n\nThings get weird the very first night I arrive. The staff arrived a few days early to get things set up for the kids.  At night we told stories and played games. The director, the only person technically in charge of me, is very into Risk. He proceeds to claim more troops than I think the math accounts for on the basis of a technicality. I tried to calmly explain why I thought the rules stated things differently. It was sort of nerdy but not a big deal. He flared up right as I tried to let it go. The same guy who almost begged me to take the job on the phone  is now almost yelling at me. I try to let him finish his tirade before quietly repeating how I had literally just said it was fine. In retrospect, I might have done better if I'd accepted his charge of irrational overreaction. \n\nI avoid him because he seems a bit emotional. It’s not hard to do. I’m under staffed, theres a ton to do, and some of my lifeguards can barely doggie paddle.\n\nWeeks pass. Campers come. Every morning and evening we line up outside the mess hall to sing songs and do the camp stuff. Some of our CITs \\(Counselors in training\\) are under 18. Some of them stay up late and don't show up on time in the morning. I don't miss anything.\n\nI make friends with another director who I bunk with. One evening around line up I run into him and his stress level is boiling over. Apparently his staff is even less qualified than mine. One of his CITs somehow ended up throwing rocks at some of the campers. The camp director didn’t let us fire the CIT because we were under staffed. So I decide that calming the other area director down is more important than one lineup.\n\nThe camp director seems to take it as a personal insult that I miss line up. We haven't had any more kerfuffles but his attitude reads like he's looking for trouble. When I went off duty that night and check in to let him know I’m going into town (to pick up some personal food as variation from the cheapest Aramark menu repeated every week) he tells me I’m not allowed to leave because I missed lineup. He talks over me repeatedly when I try to speak. He implies he doesn't care about the emotional well-being of his staff. The only reason I didn't quit right there was because we only had 2 weeks left and I needed the money.\n\nLast week of camp we finally get the new docks the camp director had told me we’d get the first week. As far as I can tell, the director has said many conflicting things about when the docks are arriving. I suspect he neglected to order them on time. Anyways, we have mere days of camp left when they arrive. The director demands I use my off-time to install the docks with my staff.\n\nThe docks are floating docks. There are metal rings about 15-20 feet underwater in concrete slabs which he wants us to tie them too. The docks themselves have metal rings sticking out from their sides(I have no idea why they were designed like this). Realistically only one of my lifeguards besides myself can stay down long enough to tie down the docks. I end up doing the brunt of the work but I like it. It's almost fun trying to hold myself under while tying the ropes as tight as possible to prevent the floating docks from running into each other when the tide fluctuates. I'm satisfied when we finish. The docks may not be at perfect right angles but they are secure. The campers love them fill the air with delighted shrieks as they dive from one floating contraption to the next.\n\nAfter dinner the director calls me down to the waterfront. He wants the docks in a perfect formation he has devised. He does not care that he told me to set them up how I thought best. He does not care that I am bone tired. He directs me to cut the ropes he had me use to save time and then re\\-strap down the docks with new ropes he just bought in a new formation. He ignores my worry that the docks will float into each other. It's purely a matter of tying them down tight enough at this precise moment, right?\n\nI stifle my groan and do what he says. The next day I come down to the waterfront. Sure enough, two of the docks are softly bumping each other with significantly more destructive force than Chinese water torture. I waited until the last day to tell him about the damage. It’s only a few days but the docks are cheap unfinished wood. It looks like some took an axe to the chunks where metal rings impacted into the sides again and again. I feel a bit bad about future campers but seeing the look on his face as he realized he would have to explain to the owners of the camp why their brand new docks were already damaged was priceless.\n\nI'm sure he blamed the damage on me instead of taking the fall. I don't care. Just knowing he knows is enough.",

        "text": "Sorry for formatting, on my phone TL:DR at the bottom\n\nThis happened a while ago but I’ve had somebody get back in touch with me recently so I feel I should tell this story.\n\nI worked in sales for an outsource company who’s biggest client was a major energy provider within the UK. Over my time I developed a major portfolio of clients that would exclusively deal through myself for one reason or another. This is important to the story. \n\nThe job by and large was, initially, like any sales job. I had a base salary which was close to minimum wage but for the first year thanks to my portfolio I managed to double my wages. I still had to fill my boots with day to day sales due to the nature of the industry but the portfolio allowed me to do most of my target without having to sweat.\n\nAnyway, 2 things happened. The first was a major change in the commission structure the outsource had. Not only did we as sales reps have to suffer a 50-70% decrease in commission but a threshold was introduced in which most workers wouldn’t receive any commission. \n\nThe second, which had been threatened before, was the energy provider demanded that I give up my portfolio due to structural changes. I kept refusing but my job status at this point was threatened this time around.\n\nI was dragged into a meeting initially to discuss with my line manager and the energy provider representative about the transition of my portfolio to a dedicated account manager at head office.\n\nI went in and said my piece and the conversation went like this. (Roughly from what I can recall)\n\nManager: We need you to accept that this is going to happen here. We have laid out a plan but I’m sorry with the client request we can’t do anything.\n\nMe: I don’t accept it though,\n\nManager: that’s fine you can leave, you’re expendable and any idiot could do your job. Now as I said if you are going to leave you can give up the portfolio\n\nAt this point I handed in my notice and gave them the contact details of the portfolio, I have since found another job. In the process of working there I had documented personally a lot of my portfolio and had informed them of the circumstances.\n\nI have since moved into another industry and coincidentally called a customer about something different but due to a good relationship we remembered each other. I had found out the ceased trading with said energy supplier due to the account manager being an asshat.\n\nThis prompted me to do some research. I found several of my former clients had done the same and the energy supplier fell out with the outsourcing company not being able to take my portfolio back on as my replacement couldn’t hack it. This resulted in the energy supplier not renewing the contract.\n\nTL:DR. My line manager says any idiot can do my job which I had perfected over years. Then finds out in fact they can’t, forcing them to lose a major contract with a client",

        "text": "So around 2 years ago it’s my second week as a temp in an IT department for a medium sized city. They just got funding for new time clocks approved. So naturally as the lowest man on the totem pole it is my job to install these in the City Hall, PWA building, Fleet services, fire stations and Police Department. I mount the one on the first floor of City Hall as a test. Community development immediately complains about ADA compliance. In my defense I didn’t even know that was a thing. So I go to my boss and let him know that we need to move it. He then calls the admins in and they have a meeting about it. They decided *paraphrasing* fuck the other department they have never done anything for us. So Im told to install all the other time clocks as normal. I get through with the ones at City Hall, 4 of them. When I get a call to meet with the director of Community Development and the City Manager *the big boss man* so I go and they say that they have to be compliant no matter what. And I’m fine with that as I don’t work hourly and will never use the clock. So I go around and move all the clocks down, which means drilling new holes and and making more of a mess. Well then my boss tells me that people are complaining that the clocks are barely two low and tells me to move them up barely. So I do. *ring ring* It’s the city manager again... this time they give me a formal notice from the city attorney saying “Here is the range at which the clocks must be mounted” so I take and I mount every single clock at the lowest possible height for ADA compliance which if I remember relight is somewhere around 36 inch off the ground. They were impossible to use for anyone over 5 foot. I then put in my 2 weeks and noped the fuck out. Just to add there were around 30 clocks total. \n\nEdit: let me give some back story. The departments were constantly at arms with each other of money and funding and support. Comm Dev was currently in a state of down sizing and was looking for money to keep people. Their build and office was no where near ADA compliant and saw that IT was getting money for a project and even ask for part of the money. I know the director personally and he later (after he too left the city) that he created the argument about the clocks to warrant getting funding for the department under the pretext of using it for renovations. I also admit that 2 years later looking at the situation I’m not happy with myself because no matter what you do you should take pride in your work. I won’t bother saying wether or not I would go back and change it because it’s not possible. ",

And there were some damn fine women—white, black, and mixes of all in-between.\n\nIn fact, some of these women of color were too beautiful, and the white upperclass was worried that white men were being lured away from white women by these beauties, so they passed a law to try to knock black women down a peg.\nIn 1786, the governor passed a law requiring black women—slave or free—to wear a headdress (known as a “tignon”). This would cover their fantastically beautiful hair and also mark them as obviously less wonderful than the white women.\n\nWith no choice but to comply, women decided to comply in the most maliciously complaint way possible: they created the most impressive, decorated, fancy, beautiful headdresses they could, turning what was intended as a source of shame into an object of beauty and a style that has had repercussions all the way to the modern day. They used lush fabrics, beads, chains, all sorts to make their required hats into statement pieces. The tignon has survived long after the tignon laws were dismissed.\n\nHere’s the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tignon) link about it.\n",

        "text": "A year or two back, I worked at a gas station in Oregon out away from pretty much everything except a few machine shops. We were kinda between a few different towns, so we saw our fair share of customers, and we had a pretty decent lunch rush due to the nearby shops and our in-building mini deli thing.\n\nWe also had a propane filling station. Now, this thing was the absolute worst. It rattled constantly while being used, and it was honestly pretty worrying. There are a few things I never want to mess with, and pressurized gasses are pretty high on that list. Luckily, management (who was pretty much always fantastic there) gave us complete control over whether we would pump propane or not. If we didn't feel safe pumping it into the customers tank, we could refuse, and they would back us up. Some people would get upset when their tank mostly made of rust couldn't be topped off. Not my problem, I like having legs.\n\nAnyhow, this pump had one major issue unrelated to safety: the gauge didn't always work. Sometimes, while filling an empty 5 gallon tank, it would only count up for the last gallon or so. Management was well aware, but corporate wasn't exactly the smartest bunch around( they also refused to replace our ice machine for 6 months, forcing us to \"waste out\" the bagged ice we had delivered instead, wasting many times more money...). Corporate told us that as long as it was working, we were to charge customers for the propane that was pumped. \n\nThis, obviously, lead to me specifically only charging for what was pumped. Of course, the meter tells me how much was pumped. And if the meter didn't tell me the right numbers, then it would have been replaced, right? The problem got more and more common, and customers loved being told that they had \"won the propane lottery\" and the pump had decided to give them a gallon or 3 free of charge.\n\nI, of course, spread this mentality to my coworkers, who were happy to stop fudging numbers around and just take it at face value. Shortly before I transferred to another station, however, there was the biggest one yet. A guy drove over from a local warehouse with two massive propane tanks, both empty. They powered the forklifts where he worked, and both needed to be filled up quickly, so his boss sent him over with a wad of cash. I hook the first one up all nicely, and begin filling it up. It takes a bit of time. The entire time, I watch the meter as it does absolutely nothing. First tank tops off. Meter hasn't moved in the slightest. I hook up the second tank. As it fills, I explain to the guy about how the meter sticks sometimes, and we can only charge for what the meter shows we pumped. He laughs about it. The second tank is full. The meter still reads 00.00, and I laugh as well. Tell the dude he's good to go, and that since my meter thinks that I pumped no propane, he doesn't owe me a dime. We have a good laugh, and he offered me some weed he had on him for a tip, since his boss was apparently going to get a kick out of it. I don't smoke, so I directed him to my coworker who did, and then he went on his way.\n\nAs far as I know, that meter still works about as well as it used to. I transferred away a while back, and I also never visit, but as far as I know, no one ever got in trouble for only charging what the meter said was done.",

        "text": "Right after law school, I got a job in a small business’s Legal Department. Bob, the overworked Legal Eagle of the department, has resented being shackled with a clueless “associate” (and thus being forced into the role of teacher) since I arrived a year and a half ago. Bob enjoys explaining theories and bigger concepts, but is easily frustrated when forced to explain his thought processes or any substantive aspects of what he wants me to do. I don’t report directly to him but am expected to help both him, my supervisor, and our other four attorneys if they need things done. For a long time I tried to be helpful and to anticipate Bob’s needs (I’m ignorant/young, not stupid) but all that changed on the day he snapped that “The amount of time you’ve taken away from my professional life with your inane questions is so soul-crushingly large that it pains me to even think of quantifying it. Stop with the questions, and just do what I say, when I say it.” It’s been a few weeks since my Malicious Compliance spree began and while I don’t expect Bob to change his ways, it does give me some satisfaction to see him floundering more than usual. None of these stories are dramatic tales of Sticking It To The Man, but Bob provides me with daily opportunities for MC. Some examples include the following:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHuman Resources emails me an employee’s full personnel file, which I’ve requested on behalf of Bob. It’s a massive 873 pages, due to the employee’s long career and the fact that someone in HR printed and placed a ton of unnecessary garbage in there, like copies of his electronic time sheets.\n\n*  Me: “Bob, the personnel file is very large. Would you like me to ema”-\n* Bob: “Just print the whole thing and put it on my desk. I want it printed.”\n\nI cradled the full file in my arms like a newborn on the long walk to Bob’s office. Bob was on a call with his door open when I walked in. Eyes widening in shock, he immediately started rummaging around in his desk drawer. I had already turned away and saw him grab some flag tags out of the corner of my eye, but he couldn’t yell after me and continue with his phone call at the same time. A few days later I saw the disheveled, flag-tagged document shoved into a forlorn corner of his bookshelf. A “No print jobs exceeding 200 pages” notice was also put above the copier by the office manager, which I now get around by combining large PDFs and splitting them into 200 page documents before printing them individually.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUPS arrives at our building every day to collect our packages and letters. We don’t have agreements with any other shipping company and would have to drive there in person to ship, which I have repeatedly reminded Bob of when he writes “MESSAGE SENT VIA FEDEX/COURIER/DHL/CERTIFIED MAIL” on hard copy letters. Bob forgets this after drafting 90% of his letters. Usually he grouches and prints out a correct copy, signs it, and shoves it at me. But one day he cut me off as I was pointing out the “FedEx” in his letter, and he said “I don’t care, I don’t have time to do another version, just FedEx it today.” So that’s what I did.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter explaining the situation to my supervisor, whose first comment was “Classic Bob,” I packed up my stuff, sat in rush-hour traffic for thirty minutes, and stood in line at FedEx. Because my supervisor had given me the rest of the “day” off (it was already 3 pm at the time of the request) I drove another half hour to my house instead of going back to the office. I had several missed emails from Bob, and a few “Where are you” and “Are you gone” emails between the substantive work requests. Further up the email trail Bob admitted defeat and copied our paralegal to do part of the work, promising another attorney to do the rest himself to meet a deadline of that evening (which he had never told me about). He didn’t reply when I emailed him the signed/scanned copy of his letter and the receipt, with the subject line “SENT VIA FEDEX.”\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLike most businesses, we have occasionally been subpoenaed by small, local courts for employment records. Usually our paralegal handles them. But when Bob overheard the paralegal talking to me about an order that was sent under seal by Big Federal Agency (“BFA”) for any and all records related to an employee, he said he would handle it personally. I protested; he told me that he “had it” and that I wasn’t to do anything with it at all. Okay, Bob. The day before records were due, Bob comes to me and tells me to put the records on a disk and overnight it, along with his signed affidavit showing we gave all records to BFA. When I check the electronic file, there is one lone PDF, which is the employee’s personnel file. Bob is crabby when I interrupt his online chess game, but I decide to break my MC rule so he doesn’t commit perjury.\n\n*  Me: “Where are the records?”\n*  Bob: “His personnel file is right there.”\n*  Me: “There are other records, Bob.”\n*  Bob: “Like what?”\n*  Me: “Well, timekeeping records from the timekeeping software. Travel records from accounting. Benefits files from HR, recruiting files from our recruiting guy...”\n*  Bob: “Just pull the records and email the investigator.”\n*  Me: “I don’t have his email. There’s only a phone number on the order, and I haven’t been in touch with him since you said you had it.”\n\nAt this point Bob snaps at me to “just hurry up and pull the records.” His door slams, and he walks out a few minutes later with a sour look on his face and a one-day extension from the investigator.",

        "text": "So everyone in tech support, and probably most other work environments, knows about THAT guy. The guy who expects you to fix everything in his life, who complains about the stupidest things. Well, today that guy asked for a favour...\n\n\nMr Jerk stumbled upon me while I was filling my mug with coffee (the first of the day might I add, terrible timing on his part).\n\n&gt;Oh perfect, I was just looking for you!\n\n*Get out of my sight*\n\n&gt;Morning, what can I do for you?\n\n&gt;Well I have this fruity laptop and I can't get my FruityID to stop bothering me.\n\n*Oh is it those pesky, annoying, not-at-all important updates again?*\n\n&gt;I'm planning to use it as a secondary work laptop I want that ID gone but I can't fix it myself, can you help me?\n\n*Really? It's like three clicks dude*\n\n&gt;Yeah sure, just bring it to my office after lunch and I'll do it.\n\n&gt;Thanks. See ya!\n\n\n*Cue post-lunch*\n\n\nMr Jerk walks into my office, looking happy and smug as ever.\n\n&gt;Here you go! he says and hand me the laptop.\n\n&gt;Great. So you just wanted the FruityID gone right?\n\n&gt;Yeah, but thinking about it, just remove all syncronising accounts and stuff, it just annoys me anyway.\n\nhe responds halfway out the door. Before I can answer he's long gone, and I'm left with the fate of fixing this thing.\n\n\n*He said \"All accounts\"* I think to myself as I open the laptop. *I better do as he asks* I decide.\n\n\nSo this guy can barely power up his laptop. Thinking he knows how to actually get things right, well let's just say I'd rather hop on the lottery. So his laptop are a mess, and nothing is syncs properly. Meaning, if I delete these accounts from his laptop, the chance of him losing tons of data is huge. But he asked me to do it, soooo... I did... On the bright side, he's got a lot of free disk space now!\n\nCan't wait for him to come pick it up on monday. I bet he'll be delighted!\n\n\n\nBonne voyage people!\n\n\n\nEdit 1: Formatting... \n\n\nEdit 2: He has unfortunately not picked up his computer yet so I can't give any info on his reaction. Will post updates when he has picked up his computer.\n\n\nEdit 3: Some of you disagree with my approach. I see why. I admit it wasn't the nicest thing I have done. However, in my defence this guy is the absolute worst. He complains about every single detail not done exactly the way he wanted it done. I should probably have cleared that up in the first place but that was the whole purpose of my choice. To teach him that he can't always have his champagne brought to him on a silver plate, by a butler, and that he should start being careful about the information and instructions he gives us. This is not the first of these kinds of problems we've had with him.",

I work as a mentor rep for tech support. \n\n\n Essentially, we have our own steps of escalations when we have an outage or lots of offices/centers go down. One of these steps is to send off a Critical Incident Ticket (CIT) which goes to just about everyone up to the VP to advise that there's a massive outage. This time was different.\n\nOne day, we had one customer with no service. We were getting a new office going and this customer was going to be the first one on this office. Now, that office went down because it was new and not yet activated. I advise my Manager (M) about this.\n\n\nMe: Hey, M.\n\nM: Hi u/devdevo1919. What's up?\n\n\nMe: So, we have an office down but--\n\n\nM: Create a CIT!\n\n\nMe: But, it's one customer and the office has not been activated.\n\n\nM: It's still an office down! Create a CIT!\n\n\nMe: But, M. It's only **ONE** customer on this office.\n\n\nM: The process is to create a CIT. Please create one.\n\n\nI return to my desk and create the ticket and send it off. I feel ridiculous because I know a lot of people way above me are going to be emailing me and asking why I created a CIT for an office that wasn't even activated yet.\n\n\nSure enough, about 15 minutes later, I have about a dozen emails from at least a half dozen different managers asking:\n\n\n&gt;Why is this for one customer?\n\n\n&gt;What is this for?\n\n\n&gt;Why is only one customer affected?\n\n\nAnd so on. Each of these emails had my boss CC'ed to it so I get hauled into his office to explain myself. I was honest and then M got hauled in. My boss wanted me to forward each email asking why to M so he could reply and explain why a ticket designated for massive outages was made for ONE person. \n\n\nNeedless to say, M was scheduled for training on when and how to use the CIT tool and I had a few extra cups of coffee. Each manager that originally replied apologized to me and since then I have not been asked to create a CIT again unless it's a legitimate outage.\n",

        "text": "Way back in time, all the way back in the 90s I studied Chemistry at school, among other subjects. For most of that time my lessons were taught by one teacher. We shall call him Mr K. In fact, we won’t call him Mr. K at all, for his name was Doctor K, and nobody was ever allowed to forget that. He had 3 chemistry-related degrees, and that made him important, and you were damn well going to call him Dr. K or get out of his class.\n\nWhile Dr. K was generally a good teacher if you were competent at the subject and I got on fine with him personally, he had many idiosyncrasies and no tolerance for those without an aptitude for Chemistry. \"I don’t understand how anyone could be bad at chemistry –we’re all made of chemistry so we should all understand it, after all\" he would often exclaim – often followed by \"and that’s DOCTOR K to you\". Not showing complete mastery of the subject was nothing short of a personal insult – it’s as if you were trying to say he was a bad teacher. Too much of that and you’d earn yourself detention. Our school had two ways of handling detention – minor issues were supposed to earn you detention overseen by the teacher in question, with more serious issues resulting in Friday night detention with the head of year. Of course, Dr. K was far too busy being a Chemist with three degrees to run his own detentions, so everyone went straight into detention with the head of year.\n\nOne of Dr. K’s favourite teaching methods was to take the tests he assigned to the class himself to prove how easy it was if you applied yourself. Now you’re probably thinking \"Of course you can pass the test. First of all you’re a wise and powerful Chemist - with thee degrees no less – and are in fact the very same person who wrote the test.\" I can assure you that we all thought exactly the same – but Dr. K was a Doctor of Chemistry after all, so he knew best. If he could pass the test, surely those who had received his wisdom should be able to do so too.\n\nAbout half way into my first year of my classes with him, Dr. K was so incensed with the perceived lack of basic understanding in his class that he put together a Basic Test of Chemistry Competence. Anyone not scoring 100% on the test (and to be fair it was a very easy test, multiple choice and mostly could be answered by looking at the posters plastered on the walls) would get a month of detentions. As was usual, Dr. K sat his own test alongside us, finishing early with a self-satisfied smile. Scoring the tests was done as usual - by swapping papers with the person next to you (and no thinking you can fake each other’s scores - Dr. K wasn’t quite busy enough of a Doctor of Chemistry to not do random checks).\n\nAbout half way through the scoring a murmur of discontent filled the room at one of his answers. A hand quickly shot into the air. \"Dr. K, I think you made a mistake here. Hydrogen has the lowest atomic mass, not the highest.\" \"Ah yes, of course. Well corrected.  Moving on to the next question.\" And so it went, until the marking was complete. As was usual with his tests resulting in punishment, procedure was followed to go from the back of the class to the front, announcing the names of everyone who had failed to reach perfection and would face a month of detention for Dr. K to make note of. Six or seven names were announced and then, unexpectedly, the person marking Dr. K’s test said \"And you too, Dr. K. You got question 21 wrong.\"\n\nSilence. For about ten seconds. Until \"Well obviously I’m not going to...\" and the class erupted. With shouts of \"That’s not fair!\" \"Why should we follow the rules if you don’t?\" \"Well I’m not going either then!\" \"Lead by example!\"...  You get the point. Dr. K eventually accepted defeat the only way he could. Not by cancelling the punishment, for many fine soldiers were willing to fall on their own swords that day, but by letting us know that he’d be present to \"oversee your detentions personally\". That was good enough to calm everyone down.\n\nEnd of school on Friday came and while I wasn’t present, a reliable attendee reported back that apparently Dr. K spent the first 10 minutes chatting with the head of year before getting up and heading to the door. A couple of the guys from my chemistry class got up as if to follow him out. When asked by the head of year where they thought they were going, they said that if Dr. K was allowed to leave detention early, so were they. A brief explanation later, after much sniggering from the pupils present and a disapproving look from the head of year, Dr. K was sat back down and stayed for the rest of detention – and did so for each Friday for the rest of the month.\n\nAs an addendum, I also happened to have Geography lessons with his wife, Mrs. K, who also taught at the school and whom I had a good relationship with. The following Monday in conversation with her I jokingly said that I hoped him being home late on the Friday didn’t ruin any plans for their weekend. \"No not really, but it’s not like him to run detentions, so I’ll let him off this once.\" Of course, I then just had to tell her the whole story of how he wasn’t actually running detention – he was IN detention. Mrs. K shook her head and said \"Just wait until I see him tonight...\"\n\nTL;DR – This is the story of how my class made our teacher follow his own rules - by putting himself in detention.",

        "text": "So I actually have two stories for you, both told to me by my grade 10 science teacher, who was my favourite teacher for all of high school. His classes were a blast, filled with random tangents and non sequiturs, and I can totally see him doing this.\n\nFirst is short but sweet:\n\nEvery Friday, he would give us a quick 10-question quiz on what we had covered during that week. They were graded, but didn't count towards our grades; it was just so we could see what we needed to go back and study more. They only took a few minutes, so at the beginning of his career, he called them 'quickies'.\n\nWell, after a while, the school tells him that he can't do that anymore, because of the sexual connotation. So next Friday rolls around, and he tells his class 'Well, I'm not allowed to call them 'quickies' anymore... so from now on, we're gonna call them 'testes'.'\n\nThe second tale, I'm not sure if this really falls under 'malicious' compliance, but at the very least I think it counts as 'hilariously clever' compliance.\n\nSo he's telling us that when he was our age, his science teacher told everyone on the first day of school that if anyone could memorize and sing him [Tom Lehrer's \"The Elements\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGM-wSKFBpo), that student would get an A for the semester. He'd been telling his students that for years, but no one had ever taken him up on it.\n\nUntil my science teacher.\n\nSo, for the entire semester, he practiced and practiced and memorized and practiced until he had it down pat... and then waited for the end of the first semester. First day of the second semester, he stood up at the front of the class and sang the whole song.\n\nFortunately, his teacher was a man of his word, and gave him his A. So he was able to kick back and relax for the entire rest of the semester, without having to worry about his grade. But for every year after that, the teacher amended his promise to just counting as a percentage of their grade, not an instant A.\n\nAs an added bonus, he *still* remembered the song, and sang it to all of us.",

        "text": "Not sure if this story is the best fit for this sub, but I've been sitting on it for a couple of years now. On mobile, so formatting may be weird. Apologies in advance.\n\nA couple of years ago I took an engineering design course in college. One of the major assignments was to disassemble and reassemble a lawn mower engine and get it to run afterwards. I'm a car enthusiast and mechanic in training, so this sort of assignment was right up my wheelhouse.\n\nI was given my engine, a small single piston lawn mower engine mounted to a wooden slab. I fill it with oil and start it up and it runs just fine. Fair enough. I begin the disassembly process. I get down to the valves, and I found the exhaust valve in particular difficult to remove. I don't know how it happened in between running it and now, but the exhaust valve had bent, meaning it was binding with the cylinder head. This meant that it could stay closed when the engine is running, which is obviously very bad. In fact, turning the crankshaft by hand confirmed this. \n\nWe were told to report any defects found to the engineering faculty so we could get replacement parts. I brought the bent valve to my professor, explained the problem, even showed him in the engine what was happening. He had the engineering department at my school take a look at it over the weekend and give me a new part.\n\nCome Tuesday, and the bent valve is returned to me. Apparently they couldn't find the problem. Huh? I certainly wasn't seeing things, you could clearly tell just by looking at it that the valve was bent. I went back and pressed them harder. My grade in the course depended on whether or not the engine ran after it had been reassembled. After several attempts with no luck, I pleaded with my professor. He was sympathetic. He told me to make sure nothing else was defective and reassemble the engine, and he would be lenient with my grade. He and I both knew what could happen if that valve sticks.\n\nKnowing I had a strong case with my professor, I reassemble the engine. Everything else seems to be in working order. Knowing shit is about to hit the fan, I fill it with oil, gasoline, then go to start it once more. Only this time it wouldn't start. A few more attempts at the puller with no luck, until all of a sudden **BANG!** What sounded like a gunshot echoed across the campus.\n\nThe engine was then sent to the engineering department. The exhaust valve was in multiple pieces. The piston was destroyed, the cylinder wall was cracked, and you could see where the building exhaust gasses desperately tried to escape the compression chamber. The engine was toast.\n\nIn my plea, I mentioned the bent valve and how I tried to get a new one. Like I said earlier, my professor sympathized and gave me a good grade even though I blew up the engine.\n\nHad they replaced the one valve, they would still have a working engine. However, due to their ineptitude, they now have a blown engine on their hands with a hell of a lot more wrong than a single bent valve. \n\ntl;dr Had to disassemble and reassemble a lawn mower engine for class. I found the exhaust valve bent but the engineering department refused to replace it. I continued anyway and proceeded to blow up the engine while trying to start it. ",

My housemate uses my roommate’s snapchat to insult me and basically cyber bully me but he did tell me “if we’re not allowed to use it, it doesn’t belong in the common area.” He loves playing my video games so tonight, while he is sleeping, I am currently finishing packing up everything of mine that was once in the common area. That means no more playstation, no more nintendo switch, no more movies, no more HDMI set up, no more printer usage and no more fun. I hope they realize exactly how much I brought to the table when we moved in and how much they’re losing out",

One day she was bemoaning her poor grades as apparently the prof wasn't a fan of the turtles she made out of clay. He thought that ceramics should have a deep and personal meaning, blah blah blah. She tried to reason that maybe turtles meant a lot to her, personally, but he pretty much gave her the ultimatum of either no more turtles, or get a failing grade.\n\nWe commiserated and agreed this was unreasonable cuz isn't art subjective? And how can you ban a particular subject matter? She agreed and said it pissed her off but she told the prof she'd go along. Then, with a devilish smirk, she exclaimed, \"But he didn't say anything about penguins!\"\n\nMan I hope she made penguins for the rest of the semester.",

I'm 21 and the past few months have been the first months I've spent with her after she ran off 10 years ago.\nAnyway, I've recently been thrown out of my bedroom so her boyfriend (of a whole 2.5 weeks) could have his own space when he's over, which is constantly. This has caused a lot of tension. \nSo I'm in the living room today, literally my first day off in over a week and the only one I'll have for another 4 days, and she drags 3 baskets of clothes in, screaming at me for not folding \"my shit\". *\"You don't do anything else around the house* (complete lie btw) *so the least you can do is fold your shit.\"*\nWhat do I do? I fold my clothes. Where is the malicious compliance? I only own 4 outfits, less than a full load. And only 2 were to be found in all 3 baskets of laundry. So when she comes back into the room an hour later and sees the laundry still sitting, she flips her shit. *\"Didn't I tell you to fold the fucking clothes?\"* Well yes. *My* clothes. 2 pairs of pants, some socks and delicates and 2 work shirts. She then lit a bowl (Colorado, so it's legal) and talked shit on me to her boyfriend. \n\nSummary: controlling mother gets angry when I do exactly what she wants.",

        "text": "This post is specific to Magic the Gathering (a card game), but you can imagine chess or some other game that can be either casual or very competitive in rules enforcement. \n\nA few years ago, I was playing in a competitive tournament called a Pro Tour Qualifier. I had won 6 matches in a row, before facing a familiar but douchy player from my local scene. By way of background, this guy (let’s call him S) was in his early thirties and had a habit of making fun of new players when they didn’t make optimal plays. He also had a habit of trying to enforce competitive rules (think of chess’s rule that you must move a piece if you touch it) in even the most casual of games. I am very casual, but \n\nAs our match starts, we have the chance to shuffle/cut each other’s decks. While I prepare to cut, S says “I don’t want you to try to hide behind casual rules. And don’t you dare smudge my sleeves when you shuffle.” I don’t think much of it, but then S calls a judge over to report me for only ruffle shuffling my deck six times after I search my deck for a land on the first turn (seven shuffles are technically complete randomization, but almost nobody does this in my area mid-game). I was pissed, and I knew he did it to try to get in my head. \n\nHere’s the thing about S: he’s a pretty good player, but he tilts harder than anyone I’ve ever met and frequently takes shortcuts. I was also, at the time, pretty competent with competitive rules. So I decide that every time S misses a trigger, taps lands wrong, or otherwise messes up, I call a judge. \n\nAfter only five or six minutes (and 4-5 judge calls with two warnings given), S freaks out and starts swearing at me. \n\nS: you F$ck/ng fat retard, you don’t know how to play so you hide behind these stupid Go//am&amp; rules! Just play the F@c$ing game. \n\nMe: Sorry S, you told me not to play by casual rules. \n\nS: I’ll tear your head off, you motherf...\n\nAt this point the judge, who was still close by, comes and tells S to get up and leave the table. S flips out and pushes the table over (with both our decks falling to the floor). \n\nYou probably won’t be surprised to learn that S was disqualified from the tournament and later suspended for 18 months from any sanctioned play. I felt a little bad because that wasn’t what I was trying to do, but then I went to my card shop the next week and none of the kids were being harassed. I guess it worked out. ",

        "text": "I work for a large office supply company, in their own brand warranty and support. Any product they slap their name on I deal with. I know way more then I've ever wanted to know about shredders, laminators, paper, hole punches, etc in my life. Also relevant later on is that our department is relatively small (30 people) so we do try and make sure that if someone is calling BACK about an existing issue we have them talk to the same agent they spoke to the first time. It keeps their experience consistent and develops a relationship, which is nice.\n\nThis particular story is actually about a customer who had a broken chair. We'll call this customer DEL, short for \"Doesn't Ever Listen\". DEL called in to our team with a 2 year old chair within it's warranty. My company's warranty is a parts only warranty, which means that if you call us and say \"[BLANK] part on my chair isn't working\" we will send you that part as many times as you want during the warranty. That being said, we do TYPICALLY have the authority to go above and beyond in special situations (elderly customers, a part failing 405 times in a year, etc) to help people out. We tend to use this only for people who are nice and follow our process; circumventing the parts warranty is a COURTESY after all.\n\nNow, DEL came into the call already very wound up. He had a very common problem we see with chairs; the seat plate (chair controls) on the bottom of the seat had come loose and was causing the chair to lower to the lowest height. This can also happen when the hydraulics fail, however when that happens you can hear a \"HISS\" when you sit on the chair. So the conversation goes like this:\n\n&gt;**ME:** So DEL, can you have a seat in the chair and let me know if there's a hissing noise?\n&gt;\n&gt;**DEL:** What?! No! I already know the issue, I need new hydraulics, just sent me that part.\n&gt;\n&gt;**ME:** Sir, there could be two parts causing this issue. Could you please sit in the chair and let me know if it makes a hissing noise, like air escaping?\n&gt;\n&gt;**DEL:** Listen here, I'm an engineer, I KNOW what the problem is, just send me the hydraulics and stop wasting my god damned time. I don't need some girl trying to troubleshoot a problem I already figured out.\n\nAt this point I just have this FEELING that it's not the hydraulics. Most customers notice and mention the hiss at the beginning of the call. However, you know what? If you want hydraulics, you get hydraulics. I'm just SOME GIRL after all, not like I do this every day.\n\n&gt;**ME:** Alright Sir, why don't you confirm your address for me and I'll get that sent out right away.\n\nWe confirm his address, I order the hydraulics, and DEL goes on his merry way.\n\nSure enough, a week and a half later I get a transfer through to my line and it's my co-worker asking if she can transfer a VERY ANGRY DEL through to my line. Rolling my eyes so hard that I'm surprised they didn't stick that way, I told her sure -- I'll take him. Put him through.\n\n&gt;**ME:** Hello DEL, are you experiencing another issue with your ch-\n&gt;\n&gt;**DEL:** YOU SENT ME DEFECTIVE HYDRAULICS, I WANT THIS CHAIR REPLACED.\n&gt;\n&gt;**ME:** Sir, I do apologize but the warranty for this chair is parts only. We cannot send you a new chair, especially after two years of use. Why do you think the hydraulics we sent are defective?\n&gt;\n&gt;**DEL:** MY CHAIR IS STILL SINKING, OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE DEFECTIVE. THIS IS JUNK, I WANT A DIFFERENT NEW CHAIR.\n&gt;\n&gt;**ME:** Again Sir, I apologize but we will not be sending you a new chair. As I was trying to explain last call, there is two parts that could cause that sinking issue. Could you sit or push down on the seat of the chair and let me know if you hear a hissing sound?\n&gt;\n&gt;**DEL:** THIS IS F--CKING RIDICULOUS, GET ME A SUPERVISOR.\n\n(Yes! The magic words! I no longer have to deal with you today!)\n\n&gt;**ME:** No problem, please hold.\n\nSo I got my supervisor on the line, apologized and explained the situation. She sighed (and I heard to eye roll from across the call center) and told me to send him through. I never heard back from her how it went, but I let it slip out of my mind and thought it was finished.\n\nUntil I get another transfer THREE WEEKS later. It's DEL. This time he's not yelling. In fact, he is very uncharacteristically quiet, sparing on his words, and his voice sounds downright shameful.\n\n&gt;**ME:** Hello DEL, what can I help you with today?\n&gt;\n&gt;**DEL:** I had [SUPERVISOR] send me another hydraulic and it didn't fix my chair, so I had one of my buddies come take a look. He says the mechanics on the bottom of the seat aren't working. Could you please send me those?\n&gt;\n&gt;**ME:** [internally losing it laughing with glee] Why of COURSE we can, DEL! Same address as the last two orders?\n&gt;\n&gt;**DEL:** Yes please.\n&gt;\n&gt;**ME:** Alright DEL, you should see that part within 5-7 business days. Anything else we can do to help you?\n&gt;\n&gt;**DEL:** No, thank you. [Hangs up]\n\n\nJust knowing that he probably looked and felt like an idiot in front of his friend, and hearing that shameful tone the third time around was great. But hey! If you REALLY want hydraulics then we will send you hydraulics. And maybe DEL has learned to LISTEN when trained people are trying to troubleshoot an issue with him.",

        "text": "TL:DR at the bottom. \n\nSo me and 4 others are playing a Pathfinder game (an RPG like Dungeons and Dragons) and I'm very new to it all. I have a cool character that's basically an assassin, spy, and master Archer working directly for the King and Queen. I've been undercover as a prisoner in an enemy demon camp collecting information when the others show up to \"save\" me and the other prisoners. \n\n\nBeing the aloof, quiet spoken Spymaster that I am, I was tight lipped when I first encountered the others (Paladin, Cleric, and Soldier). Their leader was an oblivious, although well spoken and educated Sergeant who liked the finer things in life. He was also a devout follower of Cheesus. (Yes, I'm serious.) My character immediately decided he was an idiot after introductions were made.\n\n\n\"My good man! It warms my heart to see you and these other poor souls freed from bondage. Please allow me to introduce ourselves. This is (Paladin), this is (Cleric), and I? I am Sargeant Lord Lorde Duke Remington the 3rd, Esquire, servant of our beloved King and Queen, as well as our Saviour on High, the Mighty Cheesus, may his Gouda Blessings be upon you.\"\n\n\nI paused, looked at the others and said, \"Lord Lord Duke...?\"\n\n\n\"Indeed I am, Good Sir! Lord is one of my titles, since I am Landed Gentry. And, as it happens, Lorde is also my first name!\"\n\n\n\"I see... And Duke?\"\n\n\n\"That's my *middle* name! We came to free you all and put an end to this demon camp and *This* we have *Done*! But you sir! How did you come to be here? And what is your name?\"\n\n\nSince these are the Kings' men, I decided to give them some info. \"I was sent here by the King himself to learn what I could about the growing demon presence in this area. However, I am not technically in the army as I work better alone. And, If I'm being honest, you didn't save me. You interrupted a two week long undercover investigation. The subjects of which are now all dead...\" I gave him a hard look and nodded to one of the slain demons at our feet, but he was oblivious to my disapproval.\n\n\n\"Ah ha! A fellow soldier in service to the crown! How excellent! It is a good thing that we came along, indeed! The kingdom needs all the fighters we can muster! But not in the army, you say? Well we can fix that! I, Sergeant Lord Lorde Duke Remington (the 3rd) do hereby Field Promote you to Private, 3rd Class. \n\n\n(I am a trained assassin, spy, and master Archer that answers only to the King and Queen themselves... And he just made me a Private. Third Class... I opened my mouth to comment but he continued.)\n\n\n\"Congratulations on the promotion and welcome to the unit, er... What did you say your name was again?\"\n\n\n\"Actually, it's classified.\"\n\n\n\"Then Welcome to Unit Private Classified! We're going to get along famously, I can already tell!\"\n\n\nHe then spent the rest of the campaign trying to put Cheesus in my heart and mind and stomach and every. single. time that he addressed me or referred to me, he called me *\"Private Classified...\"*\n\n\nI suppose I asked for it... Smh.\n\n\nTL:DR Uppity Royal Sgt asks for my name but I'm a Royal spy so I tell him it's classified. Now I am Private Classified, Third Class...",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share a nice bit of malicious compliance from a gift/coffee shop that battled the local council on planning permissions for two years. \n\nSo, this place opened up more than two years ago and I've popped in several times since its first month of being open. For the first two years the shop had lots of scaffolding outside and looked very unfinished. There were no permanent signs up outside like you would normally expect so the shop's name, web address/telephone no, and business descriptions were always displayed on a temporary sign that was tied to the scaffolding and looked really tacky and bad.\n\nThe owners are lovely and I learned from them that they have been in a dispute with the local council since they opened. The business owners had applied to register their business with the council and stated that they wanted to display business signage outside above the shop windows. The council said they'd only let the business put up signage if they also revealed and restored the original shop front windows that had been boarded up for years. The business said no because they rent the shop and were not willing to fork out ~20,000 (edit: to restore the original windows) on a rented property. Everything was stuck in limbo with letters back and forth for over two years. Until now. \n\nI have included a [photo of the shop front](http://imgur.com/zZtn2qH.jpg) (I've taken loads of identifying info out 'cos internet safety y'all). The orange squiggles are where business signage would have gone-this is the part of the building the council refused use of to the business. The yellow crosses are where the original windows are boarded up (you can see two revealed but unrestored ones to the far right). The big, huge blued out panel is where the shop finally decided to put their business name and details: on the facade of the building rather than in the regular space that would normally be used for business signs. They have not put up business signage where the council said they could not and they did not have to restore the shop windows. They finally got rid of all the scaffolding too. I smiled quite a bit when I saw how they got round it. Good for them :)",

The person was not amused when he/she discovered that if anti-virus was running, the computers would pretty much choke (they might have been running something that was already pushing the CPU to the limit).\n\nSometime later, someone (or a group of people) in IT attempted to use those Pentium 4 computers for server usage, and didn't understand why another department was raging about the slow \"server\".",

        "text": "This is kind of a longer story, but it gets more malicious as it goes along.\n\nIn my sophomore year of community college I took a public speaking class. Being community college and a 100 level course it was full of people that generally had no interest in anything but a passing grade, but the professor was notorious for thinking otherwise. She was an older professor, late 60's, and she had taught the class like it was full of hopeful young professional speaker wanna-bes, having books and videos that we had to watch that tried to make us into the next 19th century toastmaster. She railroaded us as best as she could and she wanted cookie cutter perfect speeches from everyone on mundane topics. She was also notoriously bitchy and was born without any idea of what a sense of humor is.\n\nSo after the first little introductory speeches at the beginning of the semester, I realized that I absolutely did not agree with how she thought speeches should be and did not enjoy getting docked points for things like \"lack of enthusiasm\", or, \"didn't feel like you truly believed in the topic\", or, \"I couldn't connect with your words. Try reading X chapter from the book and practice on putting more feeling into your speaking.\" My favorite was, \"You need to find your confidence\". She was a pain for everybody.\n\nSo our first of four major speeches that made up nearly all of our grade was your typical bag speech. We had to speak for about 4-5 minutes on items that we put in a bag that related to us. They go by fairly un-excitedly, as everyone always has a camera or photograph, a keychain, a childhood trinket, etc. She was happily smiling along to all the \"Live, Laugh, Love\" style shit that people were groaning and mumbling through as we all counted down the minutes til class was over. Then it was my turn.\n\n**Speech One**\n\nI did not bring a bag from home full of cherished little memories pulled from deep with inside of me. I walked up to the platform on which we presented with a McDonald's bag that I had in my car from the day before that I had filled with my lunch for that day. I went up and one by one pulled things out the bag, made up a little blurb about how they represent me, (Bowl of cereal: I'm better covered in milk. Bottle of water: I'm completely see through and flavorless. Chocolate: I'm mostly fat, often found in a bar, and easily unwrapped. Shit like that) and ate my lunch as my speech. I finished eating/speaking, checked that I made time, and sat back down.\n\nI got a B. She was unamused and wasn't a fan of me calling myself easily unwrapped, but since I made the item and time requirements and because the class anonymously voted it as the best speech (she did that for all of them), she didn't dock me much and didn't say anything more.\n\nI had found my confidence.\n\n**Speech Two**\n\nThe next big one was the speech to inform. She had passed out the rubric and we were to inform the class on a topic of our choosing. It could be an idea, an event, an item, anything really. The only graded requirements were 5-7 minutes in length, it had to be non-persuasive in nature, and had to have three sources. We were let loose with that.\n\nThe day comes and everyone did the usual things; favorite sports team, an event on campus that they were apart of, a band, etc. One of my favorites was a speech on the history of the Weiner dog that was particularly amusing. Mine was a bit more abstract. While researching ideas, I had stumbled across a photo of a guy presenting a speech on the topic, \"Giraffes aren't real\". Not wanting to copy it directly, I modified it to, \"Real giraffes are actually invisible\". In about 20 fully-concentrated minutes, I had written and 'sourced' a speech detailing that the giraffes we see are not what they appear to be. Rather, the true giraffes are microscopic alien invaders employed by the government to \"penetrate and impurify our precious bodily fluids\". I semi-copied General Turgidson's speech from Dr. Strangelove and turned it into a government plot of using microscopic alien giraffes to control how we vote. Using [this](http://i.imgur.com/zVUm7ms.png) image from an /r/photoshopbattles thread as one of my sources, the US government as another, and quoting myself as my third, I gave the speech to an unsuspecting and bewildered class.\n\nThey fucking loved it, fortunately. It was again voted favorite and I got quite a few compliments after class and giraffes became a recurring joke throughout other speeches that people gave. I was proud of myself. The professor though was less amused.\n\nShe did not clap or say a thing, other than a curtly drawn out \"Thank You...\" after I was done. I was given a D, one point above an F on the scale. While I had met the time requirements and by her own admission did not violate her topic terms, she gave as low of a passing grade as possible. I knew I was taking a hit on the sources, even though I had honestly used the government one for citing actual voting statistics, she had written on the rubric that it wasn't serious enough and that she simply did not enjoy it. I was also specifically docked for, and I promise she really wrote this on the grading rubric, \"finding myself too funny\". I had established myself as *that guy*, and there was no turning back. So onward I went.\n\n**Speech Three**\n\nOur next speech was a speech to sell. We had one minute to sell a product in an infomercial style. She said we could have a little fun with this one and allowed us to sell something that we made up, so long as we had a physical thing to present as our product.\n\nThe day of the speech arrives and things go as normal. I forget now what everyone's product was, but there were things like a phone that never runs out of battery, shoes that make you jump super high, things like that. I was a little less worried about a bad grade this time, so I continued my conspiracy theory. \n\nMy product was Giraffe Locaters. I wrapped two pipe cleaners on the sides of a pair of glasses and gave my speech while wearing them. I talked in detail about how they can locate the microscopic giraffes that surround us in daily life, detailing all the useful features it has (such as being able to see through giraffes clothes) and other miscellaneous things that rounded out what I thought was a pretty safe but decently outlandish speech. It was again well received and won the vote. This one is a bit of an outlier, as I received a B with no major controversy. It was a passive aggressive B though, as it was one point away from an A. She wrote one comment, saying that I could have put a little more effort into the physical product I presented...\n\nBefore I proceed to the last speech which closed the class for the semester, I need to note that the professor made it very clear that she did not like me. On days that we weren't speaking, she lectured on the nuances of giving speeches. Every class without fail she would work in a remark or make a negative example about me. They ranged from spiteful comments about avoiding \"nonsensical things, like invisible animals\" to straight up attacks where she called me out by name and said \"You have showed us all how *not* to give a speech\". All this did was motivate me further.\n\n**Speech Four**\n\nThe last major speech was the speech to persuade. We were to come up with a topic and speak for 6-8 minutes on it, trying to persuade the class to believe in it. The terms she passed out was that it had to be an idea that was controversial. She blacklisted things like religion, abortion, guns, and drugs, but left anything else open. Or so I thought.\n\nShortly before speech day arrived she announced to the class that she would be going around the room and hearing all of our topics so she could personally green light them. I wonder why she wanted to do this...\n\nShe gets to me almost last after approving everyones idea without hesitation. When she got to me, she looked me straight in the eyes, smiled a lifeless smile, and asked me in a twirly little tone that said \"I want to kill you\" what my topic was. In a clear and confident voice, I said that I am going to persuade the class that cannibalism should be an acceptable source of food.\n\nIn that lovely tone, still smiling, she replied, \"No you're not.\"\n\nOver she walks to my desk and she sits down right on top of it and faces me. She says, \"Vesploogie, if you give this speech, I will fail you. No questions, no ifs ands or buts, just an F. Speak to me after class and we will find a nice topic\".\n\nSo there I sat until it was just me and ~~the devil~~ the professor. She sits above me on the desk again and tells me that I disappoint her. I clearly have so much potential of being a great speaker but I choose to waste it. She tells me that I've let both her and the class down every time I stood up to speak. She hopes that I can turn it around in one last big speech, in which I am supposed to persuade everyone to travel.\n\nTravel it is.\n\nSpeech day. Things go by as usual. Topics are generally good all around, and at this point everyone has asked me about what we talked about, to which I gave little detail. Eyes and anticipation were focused entirely on me as it came time for me to speak.\n\nI spent the first 5 or so minutes being as boring as I could, simply to get to the time requirement. She had a smile on her face the whole time as I bullshitted about \"exploring not only the world, but yourself\" and pandering entirely to her. Once I was confident that I would make my time limit, I shifted gears a bit. I said that while travel can be worthwhile, there are some places that you should be cautious about.\n\nLike the Amazon jungle.\n\nWith that I began a digression into the world of Amazonian cannibalistic tribes, punctuated with travel info on reaching them. \"But really\", I said, \"there is nothing to be afraid of. Cannibalism has been around for centuries and has been a core part of many native cultures. It also has religious ties too! Not only does cannibalism allow people to explore their inside, it allows them to explore *other peoples* insides too!\" Laughter, applause, cheers. Smile gone. I ended the speech with a warning about immunizing against giraffes before you travel, and sat down. I won the vote for the fourth time.\n\nI had to wait until the end of finals week before I saw my grade for the class. I got a C on the speech and a B overall. I made the time requirement and spoke persuasively on her topic. There were no comments written.\n\nAnd that is my story of how I followed a grumpy professors instructions to persuade and inform my way to an ok grade.\n\nOkay fine. TL;DR: I got a B.\n\nEDIT: Here's a little story to show how mean this professor could get.\n\nA friend of mine in the class was chosen at random (professor looooved randomly assigning pop-speeches) to give a more informal speech to inform us on an interest of hers. She was given a day between classes to come up with I think a 4 minute speech. She gets up there and starts to talk about fantasy/arcana type stuff that she and her boyfriend were really into. She was a cool art student who handmade a big staff out of driftwood and decorated it in a really neat way. She talked about this and other aspects of it then sat down. It was a really good speech, she got lots of compliments for it afterwards. (Because she was passionate about it!)\nThe professor thought it was a joke. She went up and said something to the tune of, \"haha very funny. Now are you ready to give us the real speech?\". My friend was pretty obviously stunned and said that she was serious. Professor, with that ridiculous fake smile and tone said \"No you weren't\". She stood up and started arguing with the professor, taking it pretty personally as one would expect. After about 30 or so seconds, the professor, still with that smile leans her head back, puts her hands on her hips, and goes, \"Shush shush shush SHUUUUSHHHHH\" and tells her to sit down. She tells her that she will be doing it again next class on a 'real' topic, and told her to do it on one of her art classes or something.\n\nThat is just one story and one of the reasons why I didn't like her.",

A grouchy older woman who could never be satisfied. Every day I'd have every fridge, bin, shelf, overflowing with stuff so she didn't need to worry about it, but it was never enough for her. I forget ONE thing and \"You didn't do anything all night!\"\n\nSo I decided one night to stock exactly what I needed for my shift. And I used it all. I took stuff back to the stock room, and walk in, knowing Friday morning was the busiest morning. I had to leave at exactly 6, management knew that, and my manager let me go. Grouchy lady had a panic attack, flipped out, called the general manager.\n\nThe next time I saw her she had words for me. I told her \"oh the overnight fairy didn't show up Friday... Can't control that.\"\n\nBut I never heard a word about there not being enough salt packs again",

        "text": "This didn't happen today, but I work at a very popular fast food restaurant. We are not a huge chain but are really popular locally. One of the best drinks we serve is sweet southern style iced tea. \n\nWe brew it in house and we make it often, so we always put a bunch of ice in our customers cups, since sugar only melts when the drink is hot and it takes forever for it to cool without filling the cup with ice. This has been the policy forever, but sometimes you get customers who ask for no ice. Normally I explain that the drink is pretty hot right now, so I would recommend ice, and usually they understand and just ask for a bigger cup or ice in a separate cup to pour it in (to make sure they get a full drink). \n\nThis customer was rude from the start, ordering a large drink and before I had a chance to confirm the order she shouted \"NO ICE THIS TIME! I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY ICE AT ALL!!!\" into the mic. \n\nWhen she came to the window, I had her drink and began to tell her my sepal about how the drink is really hot but she interrupted me and said not only did she not want any ice, but she didn't want the drink I had in front of me because she didn't see me get it out of the drink dispenser. Since we had just brewed a new batch, I had a few already poured cups to hand out, since the tea in the dispenser is really, really hot when it first comes out. \n\nAgain I tried to dissuade her and offered her a cup with ice, but she \"polity\" declined. So I made sure to give her the biggest and most insulated cup and handed off the scalding drink with a smile. \n\nShe came back to complain the next day that the drink burned her mouth. ",

        "text": "I work in a pharmacy and have wanted to post a story in here so many times, and I finally have a story that tops all other times I have had to maliciously comply with customers has shown itself.\n\nI have worked part time as a pharm tech for 3 years while working on completing my BSN. The chain I work at is the typical big-name pharmacy (Rite Aid, CVS, Walgreens), just so you have a picture in your head. A major focus in pharmacies like this are customer happiness. We are supposed to put the customers’ needs above all else, which can be pretty tough when there are legal, medical, and insurance regulations to comply with in a pharmacy. \n\nOne of the biggest issues that makes it difficult to smile at customers and make sure they “leave happy” (as upper management puts it) is when a drug needs a prior authorization. Now, there are varying levels of understanding when I say that term to customers. Because a good amount of the population is not sure what that entails (including myself before I started working in a pharmacy), I normally give a brief explanation of what it is. It normally goes like this: \n\nMe: “This medication is requiring a prior authorization before the insurance will pay for it. I have sent a fax to the doctor’s office to let them know this. Basically, the doctor needs to get into contact directly with the insurance company and justify the necessity of taking this dose/type of medication. Normally, this is due to the high price of the medication, so the insurance wants a justification before they will pay for it.”\n\nGenerally, customers are pretty understanding after we say the phrase, “There is not much more I can do, it is in the hands of the insurance and the doctor at this point”. I let them know it could be a day or two before the process is complete, and the only thing they can do is to contact the doctor’s office to let them know how urgently you may need it.\n\nYesterday, however, I got a customer who refused to hear anything I had to say about a prior authorization. Her prescription was for a weight loss drug that would cost, without insurance, around $1100. The following exchange took place. (M: me, RC: rude customer).\n\nRC: I’m picking up for RC. Just put it on my card. Please hurry, I left the car running.\n\nM: um, okay. *types RC’s name into computer* Unfortunately Ms. RC, that medication is requiring a prior authorization. *begins prior authorization speech-*\n\nRC: NO. I do NOT have time for your cutesy explanation or for the f***** Doctor. I want that medication filled NOW. And I do NOT care what the price is. Just do it.\n\nNow, in most situations I would have swallowed my pride and told the customer the massive price and secretly laughed to myself when they walked away defeated. But today I was done with being spoke to as if I was not a human being. So, I smiled and said, “alright, the current wait is 15 minutes.” RC spun around, rolled her eyes, and waited extremely impatiently.\n\nIn the mean time, I explained the situation to the pharmacy manager (PM), allowing him to explain the price to her if he wanted. As we finished filling the prescription, I called her up and began ringing her up. PM came over and said, “Ms. RC, I just wanted to give you a heads up about the price—“ “NO STOP. I already told your incompetent technician that I am paying for it. I am OVER THIS PHARMACY. Just put it on my card on file.” PM turned to me and said “you heard her, charge it to her card on file.” And that is just what I did, all $1100 to the credit card she had saved to her profile. She snatched the bag out of my hands and I smiled and told her to have a great day as she stomped out.\n\nLater on that night, we got a call from RC. She screamed into the phone about the massive charge to her credit card bill from our pharmacy. The exact words out of her mouth were, “I didn’t know the price was going to be so high.” PM calmly replied by telling her that both himself and his technician had tried to warn her of the price. PM then proceeded to tell her that once a medication has left the pharmacy, it is illegal for us to resell it. \n\nIf you want a true malicious compliance story with a great ending, stop reading here. However, RC started screaming again about corporate this and upper management that. To my disappointment, PM “let it slide this time, but would not do a refund in the future.” And she still had to wait for the prior authorization.\n\nWhile it was only a short time that the true feeling of malicious compliance lasted, it was one of the best moments of working in a pharmacy so far.",

Standard procedure is to ask about underground lines and if they don’t know we can usually figure it out or can work around a maybe it’s about here, to some extent at least.\n\nThis one tool, I meant guy, seemed nice but something was a little off with him. He wanted a tent set up in his way to small backyard but I decided we could make it work with some difficulty. He was planning to have a fish fry or something, and it sounded like he wanted to impress his guest but seemed fake about it. His wife came out to ask a simple question and his true colors shined as he screamed at her for no reason. I don’t remember the verbiage but it was uncalled for.\n\nI asked about water pipes with him explaining there were a bunch of sprinkler lines but he didn’t care if we hit them and would just fix them if we did. We already spent way to much time there because of the space constraint and I decided to just go for it. The first stake I drove hit a pipe and the ground bulged as water started building up and then started leaking. Keep going he says.\n\nA few more stakes and then the mother load of all water pipes, the main line to the house. He said it was cool. He was over the top nice to us even after that, but I knew he was a weirdo jerk. Water was absolutely everywhere but I continued to work, finished up, thanked him and left.\n\nVery nice about it but I have no idea how his guest used the bathroom as the party started about 2 hours after we left. In all about 3 sprinkler lines and the main line.",

        "text": "About 2 years ago I worked data entry/ non-emergency calls for the local police department.  Main duties were to send back incorrect reports back to the officers for re-submission and taking non-emergency reports via phone for citizens. Most common reports credit card fraud ( ex:my card is  in my possession but somebody bough $230 from wal-mart). It's usually a quick process: you tell me what website/ store the card was used, I type up your report, and in 2 days you have something to give the bank to get reimbursed .\n\n(Keep in mind, I live in Tennesse so imagine this woman, with a looooong ass, country drawwwl)\n\nOne night I get a call. A woman says her card was used she wants to make a report. I get started with the process and she abruptly cuts me off.\n\nHER:\" When will the officer be here?!?\"\n\nme:I can actually do the report here. Since it's non-emergency can get this typed up and out sooner-\n\nHER: AB-SO-LUTE-LY- NOT! I want an officer here this instant! My information has been compromised. I dont know who did, how they... what- I DONT KNOW! I want an officer here to take my paperwork. Someone I can see\n\n I try to reason with her. Tell her that, since it's not priority, *IF* I sent it back to dispatch it will probably take hours *if* someone can come tonight. Its probably about 7:30pm at this point.\n\nHER: I don't care! I WANT AN officer.\n\nTry reasoning with her again. It's a busy night, it'll take hours (I tell her probably 3+) before someone is there, that the police won't need and probably won't even take her \"paperwork\" since this happened online, that i'd only need whatever website was used to finish . I even throw in some bonus info that  most officers get these reports wrong and , if they do, it'll be sent back and forth over days because most officers are too hard headed to listen to basic instructions and they don't know how to write these reports or they get busy. This can add days to getting your cash back.\n\nHER: NOPE! NO-UH! I want an officer sent out or I will call the governer who is my personal friend and have this and *mahmahmahmahmahmah\n\nOk, lady. I send the call back to dispatch.\n\n3 hours later, 10pm, she calls again. asks for me through dispatch  HER: IS SOMEONE COMING?!\n\nMe: Idk..I can't that info, that would be dispatch. Call again and speak to the operator.\n\nShe calls again,talks to my co-worker who is very cut-throat and cut her quick. Calls again talks to me. At this point, Im' just being an ass because my co-worker and I are just laughing at her expense\n\nShe calls one final time at like 12:45 am just as my shift is ending saying angrily: I-HAVE-WAITED-ALL-NIIGHT for an officer. This is rediculous. Im gonna mahmahmahmahmah.\n\n I \"apologize\", tell her I tried warning her and , added bonus, now I wouldn't even be allowed to take the report. And the shift is ending...so it'll have to be tomorrow. (lol)\n\nThe next day, I log in to the system, she's called the morning requesting an officer. She calls in the evening  waiting  again ( she  makes a fake reference to some uncompleted report which number she can't remember and asking for me so she can get through)  I let my co-worker handle it.\n\nI kept looking up her number, saw like late that night she got officer out,  and I could see EVERY time this report got rejected. It took almost 2 weeks between the slow officer, his constant rejections, and days off.  and THEN she had to make a trip to pick it up.\n\nI tried to warn her\n",

        "text": "At the outset, I'm sorry this story isn't particularly malicious. It's the best I've got. I guess I've just been lucky to have sane employers.\n\nSo, about two years ago I was working in the Tier1/Tier2 IT support group for a medium-sized corporation. About a dozen of us, to support 5,000+ employees. It was good times. Great team, and amazing boss. \n\nAt the time of this story, I had already been working at this place for about two years. A little while earlier, there had been a changeover in senior IT management. New IT Director, and we'd gone through two or three people in the position above my boss. Never affected us much; as I said, we had an amazing boss. He did his best to shield us from management nonsense and let us get on with our jobs.\n\nThis new IT Director comes up with a new strategic goals document. It details all the priorities of the entire IT department. These goals are mentioned repeatedly in various meetings and presentations. This is fine, except for three things:\n\n1. A lot of the goals/priorities don't apply to our (Tier 1/Tier 2) team, they're more focused on the various Tier 3 teams\n2. Many of the goals that *do* apply to our team are not actually under our control\n3. Our year-end bonuses are now dependant on activity related to these goals, and nothing else\n\nIn my first two years at this place, at the end of the year we had to fill out a document detailing highlights of the things we'd accomplished. This would be reviewed and discussed with the boss, and would factor in to bonus compensation. I was an over-achiever and always had multiple pages of the extra things I'd done that year. After the new strategic goals announcement, we were provided with a new document template for that year-end review. We were only supposed to enter things related to the new goals.\n\nThis didn't sit well with me, as the kind of above-and-beyond things I'd done in previous years had no place to go in the new template.\n\nI didn't stop doing my best work. I continued to do above-and-beyond things. I liked my job, and my boss. What I also did was put on my thinking cap and try to come up with a creative way to meet the new goals.\n\nAfter some thought, I settled on one particular goal: **\"Increase the percentage of tickets resolved by first-line support\"**\n\nOn the surface this seems like a reasonable goal. Why not make Tier1/Tier2 resolve more tickets? We get paid less, so the more problems we can solve, the more time the higher-paid Tier3 teams have to work on projects. The problem with this is that our team was already rocking it. If memory serves, we were resolving at least 50% of incoming tickets (with 12 employees), compared to the Tier3 teams (at least 3 or 4 times that number of employees). Hardly any tickets would get bounced back to us from Tier3, and a lot of those went back to Tier3 with a note of \"please read the full ticket details, this *is* your problem\".\n\nThe other problem was that the company was in the middle of rolling out a new ERP platform consisting of multiple huge applications. With each new deployment/update, we'd receive a slew of tickets that had to go to the developers or the specially-trained support team (both located in HQ, about 500 miles away). Each time this happened our ticket % would drop, and there was nothing we could do about it.\n\nHere's what I came up with. Something our team handled *a lot* of was new account creation. There was a lot of turnover in some departments, plus a lot of seasonal employees. This necessitated a new Active Directory account, but also accounts in various other systems (usually two or three, but could be as high as eight or more depending on the position). In the past, I would handle all that work as part of the one account request ticket. What I started doing was splitting off the work into multiple tickets. I'd keep the original ticket for the AD account, then make separate tickets for the creation of accounts for the financials system, payroll system, ERP system, expense report system, transportation management system, reporting system, etc. \n\nThis was no extra work for me, apart from some initial tweaks to my PowerShell account creation script. In fact, it actually made things a bit easier to track the various required approvals for account permissions. It also significantly increased the number of tickets I was closing, without any increase in actual work accomplished. Previously I would close around 20 tickets in a typical day, and I would do multiple new accounts in a typical week, so my tickets closed probably went up at least 25%.\n\nAt the end of the year, when filling in the year-end review document, I entered all of this in the box under the relevant goal. I explained what I did, and why I did it. Then I had my review meeting with my boss. When we got to this goal, I explained to him what I did. He gave me a \"wtf?\" look.\n\nBoss: This isn't really following the spirit of the goal, you know.\n\nMe (with huge grin): I know. But I have no way of following the spirit of the goal. I have no control over what tickets come in. We were not given any training to be able to handle more than what we currently do. So I did what I could to meet the goal.\n\nBoss (with a chuckle): Yeah, I guess you're right. I'll have to talk with &lt;IT Director&gt; about this.\n\nAnd that was the last we heard about \"Increase the percentage of tickets resolved by first-line support\".\n\nAlso I still got a nice bonus that year.",
