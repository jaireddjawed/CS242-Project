        "text": "Hi! About to be medical student (physical therapist) here, and I would just like to give my insights (perhaps, more appropriately, opinions) on incest as a theme in literature. My course may be unrelated, but I am very fond of the literary works from around the world, so I would therefore be pleased to hear from anyone of you in the comments regarding the matter of this post.\n\nNow, perhaps many of us know this, but incestuous themes existed in literature ever since the beginning of time. One may recall the tragedy *Oedipus Rex* by Sophocles, in which it centered on Oedipus, the main character unknowingly having an incestuous relationship with his mother, Jocasta (among other plots within the play), therefore resulting in a tragic end for both of them. \n\nModern times gave rise to various criticisms regarding the incest plots of literary works. In the field of religion, the \"Adam and Eve\" story has even been used as a way to explain what I would personally call a \"trend\" in various literary works, the \"trend\" being incest. To mention a few works out of the many, *The Cement Garden* by Ian McEwan, *Ada* by Vladimir Nabokov are ones that clearly depicts the story of an incestuous relationship. In fact, even Franz Kafka's *The Metamorphosis* still remains a popular topic of debate whether the main character, Gregor Samsa has incestuous desires for his sister, Grete, despite critics arguing that this is more on his masochistic fantasies.\n\nOf course, another insight that may be linked to this is the theories of Sigmund Freud, the very person who invented the term *Oedipus Complex,* no less. I would assume that readers already know about that term, so forgive me for not elaborating more on this. I am no expert in the field of psychology (not even literature, which is why I hope to gain more knowledge here) so please allow me to refrain from going into detail about psychology.\n\nSo, what I would like to hear from you dear readers are your thoughts on this matter: Can one view the recurring incest theme in literary works as a \"nod of acceptance\" towards that taboo? Or is it simply, on the surface, a superficial way to weave a desirable plot? \n\nTo conclude, here are my thoughts on this matter. Incest in literature is, to me in my own words, a way to \"make the forbidden fruit appealing\", and the very epitome of \"romanticizing tragedy\", as most literary works involving incest end as such.\n\nIt's my first post here, so again, I would appreciate it if I can hear from any of you. Have a nice day.",

Her attention to the minute details and meaningless details of everyday life remind me of DeLillo, but her interest in the rawness and violence of existence and nature remind me of McCarthy. \n\nI loved this book, even though I still have so many questions, and can’t wait to read more of her work. Have any of you read this book? What were your thoughts on it or its ending. Would love to have a discussion about this book as I don’t see much talk about Joy’s work here. ",

        "text": "*attitudes, not attitude \n\nSorry, I just need to rant and am wondering what everyone else thinks. \n\nI'm a female writer and an active member of the so-called literary community on twitter, and lately I've been troubled by the attitudes on there toward other books. Most writers are socially progressive, which, don't get me wrong, is great, but sometimes I think they take it too far. Lots of journal submission guidelines now warn submitters against submitting stories that contain sexual abuse, misogyny, fat-shaming, racism, and just about any other kind of prejudice, which sounds good in theory, but in reality is kind of troubling. I work for a journal myself, and I routinely reject stories where it's evident the author is sexist (or at least has no understanding of how women actually think or act), but I would never reject a story simply because a character is sexist. Other journals are definitely doing this, though (as evidenced by editors' tweets and interviews), and it makes me fear we are on a path toward boring and preachy literature that deals in moral absolutism--if a character has even one bad quality, he cannot be seen as good or forgivable. People are already beginning to look at older literature through this lens. I just unfollowed another writer on twitter for tweeting a picture of Flannery O'Connor's A Good Man is Hard to Find with the caption \"problematic fave.\" Seriously? Because O'Connor wrote racist characters to portray racism in the south, she's now problematic? I see this kind of thing over and over again: suddenly it's bad to read Hemingway because he wasn't some morally upstanding citizen, Lolita is clearly a book endorsing pedophilia because it privileges the pedophile's voice over the victim's, and it's cool to reject any and all books written by men. \n\nThese kinds of attitudes are everywhere in the literary world, from twitter to essays on Lit Hub and Electric Literature to my own MFA classes, and I'm tired of it. Do I think diversity in publishing is important? Absolutely. Do I think sexist/racist/etc literature should be suppressed? Yeah, as long as we're distinguishing between prejudiced authors and prejudiced characters. Do I think recognizing problematic aspects of already-existing literature is valuable? Sure, but there's a huge difference between recognition and rejection. Just wondering when people will figure that out.\n\nEdit: realize I made it sound like I reject people just because I assume they're sexist, which isn't true. I think there's a major difference between a story that contains sexism and a story that is blatantly sexist without any reason. If a story contains sexism (or any kind of prejudice) that doesn't somehow serve the story, either in character development, theme, setting, etc, then it generally ruins the story, or at least bogs it down with unnecessary detail that leaves me scratching my head and wondering why the author decided to include those details. Hopefully that makes sense? I also get a lot of female characters that are poorly written stereotypes, and these always come from men. \n\nBottom line: I have no way of intuiting a writer's belief system. I just read stories, and they're either good or not, and part of what makes a story bad is extraneous detail and characters that aren't fully fleshed out. ",

        "text": "I just finished reading Miller’s highly recommended “Death of a Salesman” and interpreted it as “a challenge to the American Dream.” \n\nI am sharing what I understood from my first reading of the play, do pitch in and share your ideas to help understand it better.\n\nHoratio Alger’s novels in Gilded Age America illustrate the nation's most popular and enduring myth– the American Dream; as Algeresque heroes move from rags to respectability through pluck and luck.\n\nHowever, in this play American myth clashes with American reality; there is a gaping discrepancy between the protagonist Willy Loman’s ideals and his life. \n\nWilly a salesman for the Wagner Company believes he is “vital in New England,” and is therefore baffled by the failure of his ‘American Dream.’ \n\nMiller uses the recurring flute music as an expressionist device and deploys the \"Flashback Narrative / Dream Technique” to help us understand how Willy struggles between illusion and reality and has trouble defining and distinguishing the past from the present.\n\nWilly preaches clean living, friendliness, sportsmanship and honesty but ingrains the wrong idea in Biff’s head that a person can do anything as long as they are popular. Hence, Biff develops an addiction to stealing and introduces the play’s theft motif. \n\nBiff catches Willy red handed gifting stockings to his mistress and henceforth stockings become a symbol of Willy’s infidelity. \n\nWilly favours Biff over his other son Happy, though Biff at 34 years is still doing menial work and Happy is relatively successful in his job. However, Willy’s favouritism seems to have had a detrimental effect on Happy who is an unscrupulous playboy.\n\nLinda, Willy's wife dotes on him though she knows that Willy is suicidal and difficult to deal with. Howard unfeelingly fires Willy after 35 years of service with the parting shot “Business is business”. \n\nWilly feels betrayed by the myths and ethics of his society and responds, “You can't eat the orange and throw the peel away - a man is not a piece of fruit.” Between his financial struggles and inability to come to terms with reality, Willy commits suicide.\n\nBiff realizes that his father futilely pursued the “wrong” dream, as Willy derived his sense of identity from physical labour, “A man who can’t handle tools is not a man.” Conversely, Happy supports Willy’s choices, “It's the only dream you can have - to come out number-one man”. \n\nLinda’s direct cry to human dignity resonates at Willy’s sparsely attended funeral, “He's not to be allowed to fall in his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must finally be paid to such a person.”  \n\nWilly does not experience tragic recognition (Anagnorisis) before his death; there is no increase in self-knowledge and awareness. So, though his fate engenders tragic feelings he cannot aspire to the status of a true tragic hero.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n",

        "text": "I just finished reading The Outsider and I have to say I quite enjoyed it. Enjoyed in the sense that I feel I gained something from it and it was worth my time, despite it being it being fairly depressing. Certainly, the best literature sets out to say something and this did. Aside from the grand meaning, I wasn't sure what I thought of the prose at the beginning, but I found it interesting how Mersault changed from having very staccato sentence structure to long and philosophical ones near the end. I read somewhere that Camus paid particular attention to making Mersault's physical experiences more elaborate than the emotional ones. I wondered what the significance of a lot of the stranger characters was, but I believe it was meant to portray the act of observing, since there is a lot of observing. I may have gotten this from SparkNotes or some other place. The one issue I have with the book is that it the characters feel hollow, but I suppose that's the point!\n\nTwo questions: 1) It almost sounds as if Camus has written an excuse for his very own Absurdist philosophy to me. The fact that Mersault has accepted death by the end makes him alright with the fact that he killed a man and, from the reader's perspective, we quite like Mersault by the end of the book because of his philosophy. To me, just because he felt irritated by the sun and shot for no particular reason doesn't excuse him just because he has a particular life philosophy. And by the end of it he feels rather happy with himself. That's kind of a damning thing for what was Camus' real life philosophy, isn't it?\n\n2) What, exactly, does the fact that Mersault is speaking to us in first person mean considering the outcome of him as a character? This sort of implies that he lives on or has a \"soul\", which Camus would go against anyway.",
