If you commented in this [[Entry Thread]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/115098o\/entry_thread_87_love_and_best_wishes_are_in_the\/), you are entered in the drawing and don't need to do anything else. By 16:00 UTC, the winner will be selected. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to pick this winner. This can be verified at any device running Python 3.5, and you do not need to own Bitcoin in order to participate.**\n\n**Additionally, all information to replicate the Drawing at home is available on Dropbox and GitHub, scroll down for more information.**\n\n**Importantly, this post WILL NOT BE EDITED in order to keep the integrity of the Drawing. To verify this, there will not be an asterisk during the time passed since its creation. The winner will be announced in a stickied comment.**\n\n***\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *Some of the information may be unrevised, but procedures are the same as prior draws. Thank you.*\n\n***\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe **[Discussion]** Thread at \/r\/millionairemakersmeta is open. The thread also includes dates with RemindMe links for any upcoming **[Entry Thread]** posts of the season. All comments are welcome there for any inquiries.\n\n**[Discussion for Winter and Spring 2023]:** https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakersmeta\/comments\/zowh3x\/discussion_thread_for_rmillionairemakers\/\n\n***\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it is discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou can see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #87, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *Draws\/MM87*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\n\/u\/MakerOfMillionaires will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 1:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to find the winner. Make sure the hash released from the blockchain and the total number of participants match with what is described below. In addition, thank you for your patience.\n\n***\n\n**Information Used For Draw #87:**\n\n    GitHub Repository: https:\/\/github.com\/lilfruini\/CommentGathering-MillionaireMakers\/tree\/master\/Draws\/MM87\n\n    SHA-256 of Comment IDs: 6d93d636e7ecf052cd3340990505d413d4d73dbb6a8f35f848729d32ccc29584\n    SHA-256 of DQed Age: d7185d921407176e5d903a78620a122f01447206d37c6a71fb81153b6db7c41f\n    SHA-256 of Multiple Posters: b0a7c8485c5440a94a70de9fb31df1faae22a97131ec9e0659737afaada309ee\n    SHA-256 of Truncated IDs: ca1530764400ef4c1c1276cc50a3e2d0f62e65104de31f976d5a0b5002d596ef\n\n    Block Selection: The Third Bitcoin Block After 19 February 2023 - 16:00:00 UTC\n    Total Participants: 4513","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676819938.0},{"title":"[Winner's Thread #87] Hello there","author":"dextracin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/1182467\/winners_thread_87_hello_there\/","text":"Wow.

I never thought I was going to be using Reddit that much. I wanted to post sort of a tutorial, and answer questions the best I could, something like \u201cgiving back\u201d to the modding community. I did this because I felt thankful for the thousands of people who have posted ways to mod different consoles (or anything I found interesting) on different forums throughout the years, internet strangers who I have learned from. I mod sometimes as a hobby to get my mind off stress for a bit. Once I discovered what a huge platform Reddit really is, and what \u201csubreddits\u201d were, I got pulled in. I started to explore. Years later, at no better time, here I am being picked as the lucky winner of this months drawing. I am still stunned. The day I found out I was selected it was about 11pm and I was putting my daughter to sleep, thinking about having to go to the mall the next day to get a picture with her and Santa.

I felt a rush. Hello reader, my name is Jose. I\u2019m a \u2018young\u2019 gen-x, a dedicated dad, a husband, a son, a brother, a \u201csensitive\u201d family man and a friend to few. I\u2019m a bit of an introvert that loves calmness, sort of a night owl, I don\u2019t like to trouble others. I try to guard my privacy as much as I can, but consider myself to have an open heart. I don\u2019t like to talk about my problems, I often keep them inside and try to resolve them myself, but reach out when I find there\u2019s no other way. I live in what many call *the beautiful island* Puerto Rico (a territory of the USA). It never snows here, great Caribbean weather all year round, and nights get nice and slightly chilly in December, but you can still walk around in flip flops, t-shirt and shorts, no winter gear needed, and for those who like the sun and sand, you can go visit the beach any time you want. I am a video editor \/ graphics designer \/ computer tech repair guy. Been loving what I do since before graduating college. And even though much is not going the way I would like right now, I\u2019m trusting my path, accepting the process.\n\nWhen the pandemic started, and a few months after creating my account, I found myself having to quit a 10 year job to take care of my daughter\u2019s education by means of: on year 1 (@5 y\/o): directly homeschool her, and on year 2 (@6 y\/o): supervise\/help her with virtual\/online school classes. This after my wife and I decided she would be the one keeping her 17 year old job. We knew we were going to take one hell of a risky financial hit. I knew I was going to be responsible for anything that came after, emotionally and physically. I didn't know how, and this caused me high levels of anxiety that made me ironically cling to the belief that something good will happen, even when I didn't see anything that would \"really make a positive impact on me\" happen.\n\nAt that time of our decision, we took the leap in the name of keeping our family as safe as we could (especially our daughter). Our plan was to wait for schools to finally \u201csafely\u201d reopen here, and for some sort of treatment to exist. We were finally able to put our daughter in school this past August. She (7y\/o) is very happy she could finally make real friends, even though at the beginning it was tough for her to adjust and experience all by herself what school is really about. It was hard for me, too (not gonna lie). Being selected as \"Mr. 85\" is an unexpected blessing that will hopefully give me some needed financial room to breathe, and definitely help keep us on our feet. My wife has been the one paying more than half of our living expenses which we used to split. My savings are already on the brink of a wipe out, and side jobs go straight to helping. This will hopefully help me continue my pursuit in my job hunting without me having to think excessively on how a next month bill will be paid. It might help to pay for some Xmas gifts, too!\n\nI can\u2019t thank you enough guys, I\u2019m not the type to let others know about my personal stuff, or ask for things, I have always felt like it burdens others. I personally prefer to be the one listening or helping out. I sincerely did not expect to win. Thank you mods for the opportunity, and guidance. I am extremely humbled and grateful. I sincerely hope everyone that read this gets paid back by life abundantly in a very positive way!\n\nI know my \u2018crypto-illiteracy\u2019 will limit my chances for extra donations, but Im good with that. With much respect (and as the saying goes) *\u201cyou guys owe me nothing\u201d*.\n\nThank you all and take care!\n\n\\-JG\n\n**Edit 1:** I fell asleep beside my lil' queen at about 11:30pm. She's enjoying her Xmas vacay's a bit much, and starting to mess up her \"time to go to sleep\" routine. I woke up a little after 2:40am and checked on her, as usual. I see its all good, I see my wife is deep asleep so I went out to look for my phone.\n\nI  wanted to share with y'all that earlier today (about 5 minutes after I posted) my daughter recognized my phone (on the sofa) going off constantly with the \"knock on a door\" type sound notification. She brought it to me and asked me why was it making the sound so many times, and who were the names that were coming up on the notification screen. I immediately knew what it was, but I told her *\"ah...just some messages I haven't read\"*  as she gave me the phone and went on to chat with me about what Roblox game she was playing and how she was decorating her roleplaying house. I didn't want her to get suspicious and tell my wife yet.\n\nI told y'all Im a sensitive dude, all you awesome compassionate souls got me sporadically choked up ballin' my eyes out, all teared up and shaking because of your generosity and words!  Im so overwhelmed that I'm finding it hard to keep scrolling down to keep reading, I'm even too weak to check Venmo and log in to Paypal! It's silent and Im trying to not make any noise, I'm not ready guys lol My wife is way asleep, and has no idea what's happening. I will surprise her sometime soon...definitely after I completely gather myself and get to see the whole picture.  I'm not good at hiding stuff to her, she knows me too well.\n\nIt's 3:30 am now and I don't know what to say, to the point that I feel in debt to each and every one of you!  Thank you all from the most bottom of my heart!\n\nAnd to all the kindhearted souls that have been cheering me on and asking me to open up a crypto wallet, I will try!\n\nEdit 2: This has been one heck of a ride! Barely any sleep lol I have been reading messages throughout the day of all of you on Venmo, Paypal, and here, private and public ones. I'm trying to answer back as many as I can!  I was able to open a wallet thanks to the help of the mods. They kindly added the addresses, I just opened 2. Im still new to the language, coins and all that, but I want to thank all of you who donated through there!\n\nAnd to those who feel like wanting to give, but cannot...Don't worry! I understand, I have been there many times in my life, words and motivation you guys give is more than enough!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Everything listed should result in direct lines of payment to [\/u\/Joeygcpr](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/Joeygcpr).

Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it is discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou can see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #85, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *Draws\/MM85*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\n\/u\/MakerOfMillionaires will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 1:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to find the winner. Make sure the hash released from the blockchain and the total number of participants match with what is described below.

It takes a few minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few coins. Every cent makes cents, and counts!\n\nIf a lone $1 or three can get you decorations, then imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. You could even buy a Christmas house with that kind of money (I think, I\u2019m not sure how the housing market looks over on the North Pole).\n\nA million dollars can make someone\u2019s starry night. Spread the word: have your friends and family comment, post the link to your friendly-neighborhood social media network, and share it to anyone interested.\n\n#**Happy Holidays!

Firstly, just wanted to say that I\u2019m so sorry for how long it took for me to post. I am completely new to cryptocurrency and was dealing with setting it up. I was asking questions to the moderator each step of the way in setting up the wallets. I did look up some guides and research a bit myself about the wallets, but I couldn\u2019t find info about everything. As to why it took so long. I\u2019ve gotten some stuff going on in my life that really made it difficult for me to complete everything A.S.A.P. With that out of the way.\n\nI am freaking out. I always thought that this subreddit was such an amazing idea and it was always exciting to enter for the chance to win so much money, but I really never expected to actually win! What an amazing thing to happen!\n\nA little bit about me: I\u2019ve been in a terrible situation for a very long time now. I won\u2019t go into detail about it, but this situation causes much interruption in my life, really gets in the way of me doing the things that I want to do and has really, really gotten me down. I haven\u2019t gotten too many happy memories as of late, but this is just positively exhilarating and is something that I will remember for the rest of my life, I\u2019m sure.\n\nAs for what I like to do, I like to play games (mostly video games), discuss philosophy and I absolutely love music. Music is everything to me. It can really bring my mood up and it makes me feel things that I can\u2019t really describe, especially singing. Recently I\u2019ve been interested in playing instruments, particularly fascinated by the violin at the moment. I\u2019ve wanted to buy one, maybe rent (it\u2019s expensive!), and I wanted to take lessons for it as well. I\u2019ve been excited about doing this for a while now so, maybe that\u2019s what I will use the money that I receive from this giveaway on; maybe play some other instruments as well down the line.\n\nI am truly happy and grateful to be chosen as the winner in this month\u2019s giveaway and will certainly be paying it forward. Thank you all and I wish you all luck to also be chosen one day!\n\nEdit: Wow, SO MANY NOTIFICATIONS! In less than 24 hours, the amount of donations and money received is staggering! Thank you so much to everyone who has donated so far. Know that you\u2019ve made someone that you don\u2019t even know very happy. Very generous of you all.\n\nEdit 2: It's over 3 weeks later now and I'm still receiving donations. I just wanted to thank you all once again and reiterate how grateful I am for all of your contributions and support. I wish you all the best in your lives and hope that you all achieve success in all your endeavors, as well as happiness. <3\n\n===============================\n\nEverything listed should result in direct lines of payment to \/u\/DrageLid.

Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it is discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou can see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #83, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *Draws\/MM83*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\n\/u\/MakerOfMillionaires will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 1:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to find the winner.

If it is discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou can see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #82, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output.

It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks or going through tough times and can only donate a few coins.

As of writing this, I'm still quite overwhelmed by everything and extremely surprised. But above all else, I feel fortunate and happy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not the strongest writer, especially if I have to tell about myself, but I'll try my best to paint a picture of what kind of person I am\n\nMy name is Jami, I'm 26 years old and I live in Finland. I would say that I'm pretty average, normal guy. I hang out with friends, watch tv shows, play video games, what have you. Like any other guy in their mid 20s. Generally my life is pretty decent, I got a roof over my head, a tight circle of good friends and a loving and caring family. Like it is the case for many people, the last few years have been bit rough, I'm currently unemployed as I got laid off from my office job in late 2020. Luckily, I've been able to rely on social security, my savings and help from my family, whilst I've been actively seeking for another job.\n\nMy list of hobbies isn't a long one, but a great passion of mine is drawing, mainly digital art. I love doing it, every time I get to it, I just lose myself in it for hours. I might not be very good at it, but practice makes perfect, right? I also play the drums and piano but haven't been able to pursue those instruments all that much, since it's pretty expensive.\n\nWhat I would do with the money? Honestly, it would go towards keeping me afloat with my bills and whatnot, as I mentioned, I had to dip into my savings in the past year and a half or so. I'd probably also use it to fund a new drawing tablet, my old one is pretty worn out and outdated, it could use an upgrade. I would also give some to my parents, as they have helped me tremendously over the past few years, and they aren't super wealthy either. Lastly, I want to donate a portion of the money for cancer research, specifically Cancer Foundation Finland. And even more specifically, for children's cancer research. I've had to witness a family going through it and it breaks my heart, it's a terrible thing. I'll keep you posted on the amount in this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I don't wanna end on a sad note, so I'll extend my gratitude once more to everyone who donates and to the entire community of r\/millionairemakers. It's honestly crazy that I even got picked, which in itself is awesome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep being awesome and let's make more millionaires! And remember to enjoy the summer!  \n\n\nEdit: Wow, I am absolutely blown away by the generosity of this community!! It's been a crazy 10 hours for sure, I feel that words can't describe how grateful I am. Even if you couldn't give any money and are here just to congratulate, I appreciate that too. You guys rock!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n==============================\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything listed should result in direct lines of payment to \/u\/Jamixa. We ask all users to donate at least $1 USD.

To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #79, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output.

An Update on how it went in the edit below.\n\nHello Redditors, my mind is reeling as you might imagine! What a wonderful opportunity, I\u2019m feeling quite fortunate.\n\nA little about me: I\u2019m Michael, and I live in a little off-grid cabin in a beautiful Redwood forest in Northwestern CA, USA with my sweetheart Anne, a rescued cat (Pearl), and Pearl\u2019s son CJ (Chamois Junior). We\u2019re hoping to add a dog to our household in our future. We\u2019d previously inherited a rescued Chihuahua who passed last year. I love and have had Great Danes in the past, but our home is small so we\u2019ll end up with a more mid-sized addition to the household when the time comes.\n\nI\u2019m not your typical retiree, I\u2019ve spent most of my adult life as a community activist and was forced into Social Security when the magazine I worked for (*Home Power* magazine) as an editor went under in 2018.\n\nMy longest-term passion is the promotion and use of homemade renewable energy\u2014hence my Reddit handle, Solar Bozo. I was so fortunate to find employment in the field of renewable energy activism. My other passions include train travel, volunteerism, walks in the woods, finishing our cabin, and working with Anne to hold back the encroaching forest to keep the sun shining on our solar panels.\n\nThis is the third MillionaireMakers I have participated in, and I supported the winners of the other two. My being selected will be so helpful for us as we live on my fixed income. I have no expectations\u2014just gratitude for this good fortune\u2014but hope that I do well enough here to also help out some of our local, and important national, nonprofits.\n\nThanks so much to all who participate in my MillionaireMakers. I hope one of you is selected next month, and you can bet some support will come from me.\n\nUpdate edit: I didn\u2019t make millionaire, but I did make \"thousandaire,\" and it's been very helpful. \n\nMy experiences were interesting and positive, and I got some great and uplifting comments. I looked at every posting, and will continue to do so until it completely peters out.\n\nFrom my experience: I\u2019ve never dealt with cryptocurrency before, it all has been so confusing.

I turned 30 this year which wasn\u2019t as traumatic as I thought it would be! My  fianc\u00e9e and I are a couple of cat mommas to Sushi who is spoiled rotten and the bestest boy who ever boyed, in my unbiased opinion. \n\r\nI work as an assistant manager at a local mom and pop grocery and really enjoy my coworkers and my job most days. The pandemic was a roller coaster for me being a grocery store worker but things have settled back down now and I hope they stay that way.\n\n\r\nAt the end of the day I feel like I\u2019m a very typical millennial some of my favorite pastimes include going to brunch, listening to podcasts (leave a recommendation in the comments I\u2019m always looking for new shows) spending way to much time on Reddit, being continually disappointed by my Minnesota sport teams (take pity on me) and thinking my partner is the best human in the world.\n \r\n\r\nI was at Easter with my Fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family when I had got the notification about being tagged in a post, wallowing in my sorrow from loosing the very competitive Easter egg hunt. After I read the post I jumped off of the couch, from my post lunch lay and started shouting \u201cBABE BABE BABE\u201d whilst running through the house to find my fianc\u00e9e and share the delightful news I had just received.  Her response \u201cNo way! That would be really helpful for the wedding\u201d\n\n\r\nWhich is a perfect segue into what the money will be used for.\n\n\r\nWe are getting married in October on a very cute little farm. We have chosen to go the more frugal route overall because we would like to buy a house (lol maybe someday in this market) but have a lot of extended family so making sure everyone eats and has a good time does add up quickly! \r\nWe will also probably set some aside for our hopeful mini-moon after the wedding where we hope to go to Harry Potter world, I know I know big nerd energy over here.\n\n\r\nSushi also has demanded a new scratching post from said funds so he will get one of those.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading my little about me and thanks in advance for anyone kind enough to send anything!\n\n\nEDIT #1\nWowowowow I am overwhelmed with how awesome this whole experience has been! I appreciate each and everyone of you, it is so refreshing when humans come together and do nice shit for another human!!

If it is discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou can see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #77, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output.

If you commented in this [[Entry Thread]](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/s9nj9m\/entry_thread_74\/), you are entered in the drawing and don't need to do anything else. By 16:00 UTC, the winner will be selected. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to pick this winner. This can be verified at any device running Python 3.5, and you do not need to own Bitcoin in order to participate.**\n\n**Additionally, all information to replicate the Drawing at home is available on Dropbox and GitHub, scroll down for more information.**\n\n**Importantly, this post WILL NOT BE EDITED in order to keep the integrity of the Drawing. To verify this, there will not be an asterisk during the time passed since its creation. The winner will be announced in a stickied comment.**\n\n***\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *Some of the information may be unrevised, but procedures are the same as prior draws. Thank you.*\n\n***\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe **[Discussion]** Thread at \/r\/millionairemakersmeta is open. The thread also includes dates with RemindMe links for any upcoming **[Entry Thread]** posts of the season. All comments are welcome there for any inquiries.\n\n**[Discussion for Fall and Winter 2021-2022]:** https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakersmeta\/comments\/s42hgl\/discussion_thread_for_rmillionairemakers\/\n\n***\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it is discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou can see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #74, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *Draws\/MM74*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\nI will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 1:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to find the winner. Make sure the hash released from the blockchain and the total number of participants match with what is described below. In addition, thank you for your patience.\n\n***\n\n**Information Used For Draw #74:**\n\n    GitHub Repository: https:\/\/github.com\/lilfruini\/CommentGathering-MillionaireMakers\/tree\/master\/Draws\/MM74\n\n    SHA-256 of Comment IDs: c510c3e2ad1b88eecebbee20f520c495106389ac7e59ee72bb786f8280692ec4\n    SHA-256 of DQed Age: a955760357aa9be45b9b3fadfcc51ec3c625f8ca14dd06c1145271d906902ba0\n    SHA-256 of Multiple Posters: b1c3732b43932ce1c8840e6a5f83acff2225aaa25d4803c1b32acd3116f74179\n    SHA-256 of Truncated IDs: eb184ecd228d0f362f516ff6c8f29b821b335ee71741d12ad73ebe1941b96a1e\n\n    Block Selection: The Third Bitcoin Block After 23 January 2022 - 16:00:00 UTC\n    Total Participants: 24451","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1642921144.0},{"title":"[Entry Thread #74] It's the new year, and we're making millionaires!

In case you missed it, last month there were two disqualifications that took place, one of which was an account whose half of its activity was on this subreddit, and the other who was locked out of their account via two-factor authentication warranting a poll to take place. If this sounds interesting to you, feel free to check out the subreddit and browse on the posts [Draw #73] and [Draw #73 Update].\n\nOther than that, welcome to anyone and everyone from \/r\/popular! If you don't know what this subreddit is, basically you donate a single dollar (though not mandatory, or this would be a lottery instead) and cumulatively, you make a random person a millionaire (our definition of \"millionaire\" is very loose here). It's not an exaggeration to say that this subreddit has helped people with their special days, future plans, and nonprofit causes. Thank you for coming in and taking a look, if you're new here please read around!\n\n***\n\n**In Case You Missed It:**\n\n* This is done every month, we will be doing this again in February of 2022, and every third Friday afterwards at 23:00 UTC (6 PM ET).

Given what happened last time and making sure it doesn\u2019t happen again, I would like to ask for volunteers here who would like to share their time with the subreddit. You don\u2019t necessarily need to have experience moderating a subreddit, as this is, by design, a much different subreddit to organize, being so focused on random draws and donations to the winner. If you are interested, here are my goals for the subreddit and requirements for applying.\n\nGoals for 2022:\n\n* The subreddit should be much more streamlined between making the post and selecting the winner.\n* There should be a higher participation rate between subscribers and commenters.\n* Statistics should be collected, including the winner\u2019s earnings, subreddit posts, and performance.\n* There should be a small group that reviews a tentative winning account.\n* Users should demonstrate if they\u2019ve been involved or not, such as a \u201cDonator\u201d flair.\n* There should be a minimum karma requirement that automatically disqualifies users if not reached, much like account age.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* You must have a legitimate Reddit account.\n* You must use Discord.\n* You must have a device that can run Python.\n* You must understand you will be unable to enter [Entry Threads] following your moderatorship.\n* This subreddit is primarily a four-day commitment per month. **It is expected that this commitment be honored.**\n\nIf you are interested, fill out the moderator interest form here, as we prepare the actual application. It should be ready at, by the latest, the beginning of February. Best case scenario, mods will be added by the thread for February, worst by April to give everyone a realistic timeline.  As of now, the form is just so you can put in your username, and later we will send you the actual moderator application by PM.\n\n**Google Forms Moderator Interest:** https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSe0vG8cu_yC1kIIr-Df58pZuKcvglEd71leUWdf5GZ1gOZ2pw\/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\n***\n\n#**Feedback**\n\nThe other reason we\u2019re here is for feedback. This is also the time where I plug in \/r\/millionairemakersmeta as a quick and easy way to get the moderators\u2019 attention, though it pales in comparison to posting on the main subreddit.\nGive us your thoughts on how this train is going. Leave a comment or two, or if you want to be professional, here\u2019s another form you can post your thoughts in. \n\n**Google Forms Feedback:** https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSejRv68JSYAXFr86vnDhJ1jMKdiXwrkjjuPUllUPAEdg9lyUQ\/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\nOther than that, it\u2019s been a solid year. Participation has risen since the last year the subreddit started, we made several thousandaires, and some quality-of-life changes to the operation of this subreddit. If you don\u2019t really care about this, then in one more week the thread for January will be up, so go to that and click on it!

I'm a 36 year old Brit living in the US with my wife and our dogs, Pixel and Toast. My birthday was the day before the announcement, so this has been just the best present I could have hoped for!\n\nA big thanks to the Millionaire Makers team for bringing this idea into reality. I've always loved this sub! It feels like a return to the insane Wild-West days of the internet, like those sites where you could swap a paperclip for a house! (Kids, ask your parents)\n\nHowever, unlike Hamster Dance, this idea has the power to alter the trajectory of someone's life, and I spent a *looooong* time rolling that around in my head last night.\n\nSo, full of the holiday spirit, I'm going to do a reverse-Scrooge and **I'll donate 100% of everything received** to a cause that's really close to my heart!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife works for an ***amazing*** non-profit based in Sacramento, California called CTEC, and they've been devastated by the pandemic.\n\nThey're a small but very hardworking team of speech pathologists, mentors, and trainers who travel all over California to give the power of speech to hundreds of children and adults with developmental disabilities, or to those who have had life-altering events, such as accidents or strokes.\n\nFor the people they help, this new ability to communicate brings with it independence, a new lease on life, and the ability to do the simple things that you and I might take for granted.\n\nSince the pandemic started, CTEC's funding has been *slashed*, so they're now more reliant on grants and donations than ever before. They've managed to keep their heads just above the water line, but with Omicron around the corner, and no end to the pandemic in sight, I'm hoping this boost will come at just the right time!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I have a donation receipt I'll update the thread with proof, but I'll donate 100% of the received money to CTEC and I'll be contributing as well.\n\nFor the crypto, I'll donate whatever the total dollar value at the time of the donation.\n\nIf you don't want to send anything, or aren't in a position to, then all I ask is that you just make someone's day a little brighter, even if it's your own :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore info on CTEC : [ctecaac.org](http:\/\/ctecaac.org\/), [ctecaac.org\/about\/](http:\/\/ctecaac.org\/about\/)\n\nOh, and if you buy stuff on Amazon, CTEC are listed on Amazon Smile under their parent non-profit \"Supported Life Institute\", and Amazon sends 0.5% of every purchase their way at no cost to you.\n\nPresumably, it also takes 0.5% away from Jeff Bezos, so win-win!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy holidays, much love, good luck in the next drawing, and a huge, massive, overwhelmingly large thanks to everyone!  **\u2764\ufe0f**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Edit One:**\n\nWe just passed the ~~$500~~ ~~$600~~ ~~$700~~ ~~$800~~ $900 mark!\n\nI'm *overwhelmed* by the generosity, and grateful for the stories you've shared with me about your experiences with speech difficulties!

I hope everyone has had, at the very least, a pleasant time with friends and family.\n\nI will be giving a rough timeline of the events that led up to this post, it will be copied and pasted from the [Draw #73] post.\n\n***\n### Timeline\n\n**Dec 17 23:32 UTC** - The **[Entry Thread]** opens and remains open for 24 hours. The post was submitted later than anticipated.\n\n**Dec 19 6:11 UTC** - The comments have been collected, and the data was uploaded to GitHub. The **[Draw]** post would be performed as scheduled.\n\n**Dec 19 18:54 UTC** - The first user was selected and posted, and was disqualified due to not meeting the criteria of \"minimal account activity.\" The user has now deleted their account, the comment can be seen here: https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/rjua6f\/draw_73_seasons_greetings_winners_meetings\/hp767yb\/\n\n**Dec 19 19:49 UTC** - The second user was selected and posted, the comment can be seen here: https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/rjua6f\/draw_73_seasons_greetings_winners_meetings\/hp7e6yh\/\n\n**Dec 20 15:50 UTC** - The moderation team was reached out by \/u\/ImFeroCock, an account created after the thread took place. He explains that he was last on the account through his laptop to delete NSFW content, which during that the battery had died, and that he cannot log back in due to two-factor authentication still being enabled on the account. Ownership is proven by revealing the contents of the PM sent via notification. He suggests to wait until the deadline is up to prove the account is inactive.\n\n**Dec 20 21:56 UTC** - The moderation team responds back, asking \/u\/ImFeroCock to file a ticket to the admins, and meanwhile, to try to access the account while awaiting a response.\n\n**Dec 23 0:37 UTC** - \/u\/ImFeroCock responds back, saying it is not possible and cites [a comment made by the admins](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/help\/comments\/ponsez\/lost_access_of_google_auth_and_backup_codes\/hcygpyo\/). He also provides [proof of ownership](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/ru7UL7w) and activity during the conversation.\n\n**Dec 25 5:19 UTC** - \/u\/ImFeroCock also provides account activity to the moderators.\n\n**Dec 25 6:09 UTC** - The moderation team asks for permission to share the contents of the conversation.\n\n**Dec 26 15:38 UTC** - \/u\/ImFeroCock agrees.\n\n***\n### Problem\n\n\/u\/Ferocious_Cock met the criteria for entering and becoming a winner:\n\n- Their account was a year old.\n- The account possessed account activity. While most of the activity was concentrated in giveaways, there have been comments related to trading and content.\n- The account had a verified email trophy.\n\nAs mentioned in the timeline however, the moderation team was reached out by \/u\/ImFeroCock, an account created after the **[Entry Thread]** had taken place and less than a day after the winner announcement.\n\nAs the user couldn't access their normal account, they were unable to respond to the **[Draw]** comment announcing the winner. However, the user was able to delete NSFW material from their account successfully.\n\n***\n### Poll\n\nThe subreddit will vote on the winner via Google Forms. The form will close on **Tuesday, December 28^th at 11:59 PM ET**. You will need a Google Account to vote, and votes will be shared as they come in.\n\nA new option has been added, and editing responses have been enabled.\n\n**Google Forms Poll:** https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfoQnTSb0yVEu_Q_9M7biyfbbCE0t6GPUMkdMYcuc8TtTnWSA\/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\n***\n### Evidence\n\nHere is a list of evidence that may interest the subreddit, including the conversation between \/u\/ImFeroCock and the moderation team. If there is any evidence linking \/u\/Ferocious_Cock with another account (not \/u\/ImFeroCock), please share it in the comments.\n\n**UPDATE:** In the interest of the subreddit, the moderation team has been given a forensic analysis as of Dec. 28, 2:30 UTC associating the user's account with that of a bot, and in addition, a connection to a separate user. Discussions are taking place. As of now, the poll will continue until its deadline has passed.\n\n**Conversation:** https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/44VERWm.png\n\n**Account Activity:** https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/b9VSVgQ\n\n**Video (uploaded as of 11:25 PM ET):** https:\/\/youtu.be\/jDOlc21lgBo\n\n**[Draw #73]:** https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/rjua6f\/draw_73\/\n\n***\n### Rebuttal\n\n\/u\/ImFeroCock sent this message regarding the state of the poll.\n\n> Please, I don't think that poll voting is acceptable. It can be easily manipulated. You gave them 48 hours, I'm pretty sure people will just take time log in tons of fake gmail just to disqualify me. If it was a voting service that won't count multiple vote by IP, it will be acceptable but not like this.\n\n> [THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART] It's sad that the truth people are just greedy, they will do anything to disqualify anyone just so they get their chance, I believe you can understand this. Things related to prize and money can't never be voted by people, they will do whatever it take to save their chance. I read your post and comments. Look at The evidence video on youtube, you put it right next to the poll, but they don't even care, nor even click, it has just 10 views, what they care is the poll, where they can easily do their best to disqualify me, I hope you realize this.\n\n> The point is if the video can have at least even like 1000 views, I can be happy that people understand my situation and can accept their choice but no, it's harsh but they don't give a fuck, what they care is disqualifying anyone for their glimpse chance next. I'm familiar with crypto service related to voting and whitelist, I can hire a digital marketing service to manipulate this easily with some bucks, it's not out of prediction that many people probably already used this way to manipulate the vote, the sad difference between vote and video view already acclaim that. But I won't and swear to god will never do it. Because this is a generous bless I really appreciate and I don't want to do such dirty thing like some people who did.\n\n> You, as the owner, I believe has the full right to decide what's legit based on the proof you verify and the fact that no one ever come to you claim that he is me. There's nothing else that matters. Because when come to something like this, people are just very very greedy, I'm well-awared of this. So please make your generous choice by your own will, not something can easily manipulated, I like the idea of substitute winner and another main winner you suggest, but obviously that doesn't even catch people eye, what they always want is disqualifying anyone so they can come after, we mercilessly step on other for our own benefit, that's just human, please my wife and I can still be happy with that at least, thank you very much\n\n> People are greedy and they will just laugh at my worst situation that I can't reply by the old account, and that what's they care, they don't give a fuck to the evidence video, they care about their benefit above all else. This is reddit fault and I can do nothing about it. And all of this is my trying to get what I rightfully should received. What you need , not they need, is the winner respond to you to verify activity in time and I did, nothing else is matter\n\n***\n### Conclusion\n\nThere will be a **[Status Report]** posted on January after the new year. I will talk with the moderation team about things they want to see, but otherwise you may look forward to it. At the very least, there will be information on the upcoming drawings and how to get notified for them.\n\nThis'll also be the time I should plug \/r\/millionairemakersmeta, a smaller subreddit that discusses things around the main one. As a result, posts are given more attention than a comment would be on here, so if you have something to say, I encourage you to make a post.\n\nOtherwise, I also want to say that this subreddit relies so much on random chance. There are people that, if posting on this subreddit was a job listing and the users the applicants, they'd never make it to the front page. That comes with blessings but also curses, a lot of people here probably don't deserve to be a millionaire, or even a thousandaire, but this stuff does make a difference. People here sending their five bucks have allowed people to buy stuff that would otherwise take months of planning or saving.\n\nFinally, thank you. Leave your vote, and check back on Thursday.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1640572934.0},{"title":"[Draw #73] Season's greetings, winner's meetings.","author":"MakerOfMillionaires","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/rjua6f\/draw_73_seasons_greetings_winners_meetings\/","text":"#**Let's get cookin', while you're lookin'.**\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR - This post is for the sole purpose of choosing a winner. If you commented in this [[Entry Thread]](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/ritsyx\/entry_thread_73_tis_the_season_and_with_good\/), you are entered in the drawing and don't need to do anything else. By 16:00 UTC, the winner will be selected. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to pick this winner. This can be verified at any device running Python 3.5, and you do not need to own Bitcoin in order to participate.**\n\n**Additionally, all information to replicate the Drawing at home is available on Dropbox and GitHub, scroll down for more information.**\n\n**Importantly, this post WILL NOT BE EDITED in order to keep the integrity of the Drawing. To verify this, there will not be an asterisk during the time passed since its creation. The winner will be announced in a stickied comment.**\n\n***\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *Some of the information may be unrevised, but procedures are the same as prior draws. Thank you.*\n\n***\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe **[Discussion]** Thread at \/r\/millionairemakersmeta is open. The thread also includes dates with RemindMe links for any upcoming **[Entry Thread]** posts of the season. All comments are welcome there for any inquiries.\n\n**[Discussion for Fall and Winter 2021-2022]:** https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakersmeta\/comments\/pr4179\/discussion_thread_for_rmillionairemakers\/\n\n***\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it is discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou can see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #73, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *Draws\/MM73*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\nI will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 1:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to find the winner. Make sure the hash released from the blockchain and the total number of participants match with what is described below. In addition, thank you for your patience.\n\n***\n\n**Information Used For Draw #73:**\n\n    GitHub Repository: https:\/\/github.com\/lilfruini\/CommentGathering-MillionaireMakers\/tree\/master\/Draws\/MM73\n\n    SHA-256 of Comment IDs: 806ea55fe558231a2620dfb66ce14cb26144f48775925cfc8ce75b0a86ffa1b9\n    SHA-256 of DQed Age: 5bdaf3389a1f580341b9fbfc6b1e85dede6805056c2549a2792b4dfa6f3cc9e7\n    SHA-256 of Multiple Posters: abaec7ca98b00b6274461aaa9de7a94fbf0700283f1d60f34affd3038b1dc408\n    SHA-256 of Truncated IDs: 3b629ee1779064a407b4057ad7e045dbce9a1602d142b1280bf5f8bda5bd7f93\n\n    Block Selection: The Third Bitcoin Block After 19 December 2021 - 16:00:00 UTC\n    Total Participants: 6075","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1639910561.0},{"title":"[Entry Thread #73] T\u2019is the season (and with good reason), a winner will be played, and dinner be made.

My name is Manuel, I\u2019m a 23 year old from the United States. I don\u2019t  really post much here on reddit, I prefer reading what others have said  and giving upvotes. When I checked my phone and saw I had multiple  notifications from reddit I wasn\u2019t sure what they could be, but I  definitely never considered I could be a winner here. After reading I  was the winner, I didn't believe it at first. I went to the official  subreddit to verify, and there was my username. It feels so exciting and  amazing! I was taken by complete surprise by it. In real life you  always hear people winning things in the news, but you never expect it  to be you one day.\n\nI am currently a 4th year student studying a bachelors of science in  cyber security. Around my second year studying I fell into depression  and lost all my motivation to study or do anything. I previously made  the perfect plan of which classes I should take every semester and had  all the details sorted out to graduate early. But that\u2019s when I learned  that no matter how much you plan something, things can turn out  completely different. After failing multiple classes I decided to take a  gap year while trying to work on myself and what I should do next.  Fortunately after some time I began seeing hope in things again and a  purpose. I went back to my university and decided to finish the degree I  had begun.\n\nSome of the things I enjoy doing include playing video games,  reading, hiking, photography, and just learning in general. Another  hobby I had was making origami, modular (or 3d) origami to be specific.  With this type you take a sheet of paper then cut it into small pieces,  around 64 or 128 depending on the size you want. You then fold them into  identical triangles then glue them together. With the amount of time it  would take to fully fold an object I would always tell myself that what  I was making would be a gift to someone I care about, otherwise I would  never finish it. I had a friend tell me she still had a figure I had  made for her years ago, she showed it to me. Turns out paper holds worse  than I expected over time. I wanted to keep making gifts for people,  but I wanted something more durable. So I began looking at alternative  things people make. I looked at clay, woodworking, and others, but they  all have hardware requirements that I can't meet. Eventually I found  about 3d printers. The materials used seemed to be so durable and long  lasting, at least compared with paper. Seeing the creations other people  make fascinated me with how they looked, so I ended up buying one,  hence one of my posts.\n\nAs for my other post about a software defined radio, in one of my  classes we are learning about how signals and radio frequency work. This  class is so fascinating to me, my favorite out of all the ones I\u2019ve  taken there. While browsing in [r\/rtlsdr](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/rtlsdr)  I saw multiple people talking about something called Tempest. It\u2019s  basically a wireless way to capture video signals passing through an  hdmi cable, then displaying those signals on your computer. I thought it  was so cool and was thinking of doing a project in my university about  it.\n\nThe main thing I plan on doing with everyone\u2019s support is help pay  for my university costs. With student loans I have managed to get the  money for classes in the past, but there are some things like books that  are more tricky to get. Especially when the teachers are demanding the  latest version or require an online access code to solve things. I also  want to set money aside to take different IT certifications like the  CCNA or different CompTIA ones. I am around 3 semesters left from  graduating (including the current fall one). We were always told to try  to get an internship before graduating, but since I failed multiple  classes before, and with the pandemic, this was quite challenging for me  to achieve. This is why I decided to try and get the certifications and  the research project to boost my quite empty resume.\n\nI want to thank all of you for what you are doing. Everyone of you is  so generous and kind for trying to help a complete stranger online. I  wish that everyone receives much more in return and that you all achieve  your goals and dreams. If there was anyone depressed who was reading  this, I also want you to know that things will get better.

Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it is discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou can see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #70, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *Draws\/MM70*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\nThis account will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 1:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to determine the winner.

In my free time I am taking a keen interest in the mechanics of the stock and crypto market. I find them very fascinating and would like to specialize in stock market analysis in my further education. However, for now I haven't yet been able to properly try my hand at investing since I've been carrying quite a bit of student and credit card debt for some time now.\n\nWhen the first COVID-19 lockdown hit I got abruptly booted from my job with no compensation and debt just started piling up, being months overdue on my rent I maxed out my credit card to pay that off and took out a loan to pay for my studies, eventually I even moved back to my parents' house to minimize living costs. Sadly, for the life of me I couldn't seem to find a way to dig myself out of the hole I found myself in. I currently live in a small coastal town working 12h shifts all summer long on a mussel farm just to get a chance at paying for my next semester.\n\nI've been stressing over my finances all year long and as a result of that I started looking into alternative ways of making money, which is when I stumbled upon this wonderful sub. I went into it with an open mind but there hasn't been a single point in time where I thought I'd even have a shot at winning, let alone actually win, on my third try even.. surreal.. It truly feels like I've been gifted the saving grace I needed!\n\nI can't emphasize enough how grateful I am for this and all of you wonderful people that are making this possible. However, even though it feels incredible to be this lucky, I can't help but feel like I didn't earn it. Therefore, I'll make sure that not a single donation goes to waste. Everything I receive shall go towards paying for my next semester and paying off my debt.\n\nOnce again, from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!  **\u2764\ufe0f**\n\n\n\\*\\*\\*  Everything\u00a0listed\u00a0should\u00a0result\u00a0in\u00a0direct\u00a0lines\u00a0of\u00a0payment\u00a0to\u00a0\/u\/ayylmaohss.\u00a0We\u00a0ask\u00a0all\u00a0users\u00a0to\u00a0donate\u00a0at\u00a0least\u00a0$1\u00a0USD.\u00a0The\u00a0Drawing\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0listed\u00a0for users\u00a0who\u00a0want\u00a0to\u00a0see\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0and\u00a0confirm\u00a0the\u00a0validity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0winner.

I've been watching this sub from the beginning. It's such an amazing concept, although I never expected to be on this side of the results. I was sitting here playing with [my new puppy](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/oJQdKum.jpg) when my phone buzzed. I thought it was a joke at first, but here we are.\n\n\nTo bore you about me - my name is Fred. I'm a 34 year old potter head. I joined Reddit in 2013 and I've been pretty active ever since. I got heavy into the Harry Potter subs, eventually becoming a mod. I pressed the button. I fought in the arena of \\\/r\/place. I argued with a lot of you; I've won some and I've lost some. I found so many new interests and great ideas on this site, including the concept born in this sub. I've made life-long friendships with people that I have since met in real life. My relationship had me seeking information and I ended up the mod of both \\\/r\/polyfidelity and \\\/r\/polyfamilies.\n\nOutside the digital space, I'm a father of three amazing kids and [husband to two beautiful, loving women](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rRLWvIR.jpg). I've been married for over 15 years AND 8 months. I have three cats and one very young, very small doggo. I love woodworking, graphic design, and playing Halo (XB:AweBeyCon. I suck, don't @ me please).\n\nMy plans for any winnings has changed throughout the years. All of my money last year went toward giving our new wife the wedding she's always wanted. Since then we've been paying down debts. I could use the money to do that, but I would rather take your kindness and turn it towards my family.\n\nI want to pamper my pets. I don't get a chance to go above and beyond for them really. I've been telling myself I'm going to get a cat tree for a long time now and still nothing. I want to get a decent collar that has some form of GPS for my puppy. I want to get my kids out of the house where they've been 'trapped' for the past year. I'd like to take them camping or visit some family out of state. For my girls, I would love to finally get a king size bed. It's not easy sleeping three deep in a queen, especially when I heat up like a furnace at night.\n\nSo many \"I want\" statements, feels so greedy. I hate that. I've spent so much of my adult life grinding and I don't want to be seen as a taker. I love this community and I believe in the mission that it holds. WE have the power to lift each other up in this world, and no one can stop us. To every member of this subreddit, thank you!\n\n----\n\n**EDIT 1**  \nWoke up to an overflowing inbox. This is so crazy, thank you all so much!  \nI've also added Nano per request.\n\n----\n\n**EDIT 2: 24 HOUR UPDATE**\n\nFinding the PayPal\/Venmo numbers was a bit easier than I thought it would be. Here are the total donations from 16:32 EDT, 2021\/07\/18 to 16:32 EDT, 2021\/07\/19. I never expected this, and I am moved to tears by the generosity of this community. I promise I will post another update further out with more numbers as requested. For now, these are the Day 1 totals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMethod | Donations | Total Donors | Current Value|\n---|---|----|----|\nPayPal | $519.93 | 150 | $519.93\nVenmo | $362.72 | 102 | $362.72\nBitcoin | 0.00058687 | 5 | $18.08\nLitecoin | 0.24022692 | 5 | $27.40\nDogecoin | 116.9 | 3 | $20.41\nBitcoin Cash | 0.04197320 | 8 | $17.50\nEthereum | 0.00083538 | 1 | $1.52\nNano | 18.02054 | 7 | $63.41\n**TOTAL** | -- | **281** | **$1,030.97**\n\n\n- Smallest donation: $0.66 ($1 minus PayPal fees)\n- Largest donation: 14.005602 Nano ($49.28)\n\n----\n\n**EDIT 3: 1 MONTH UPDATE**\n\nAs promised, here is the update.

Possibly users checking for the new entry thread, possibly coincidence. IDK\n\nSo far [I have taken some of the money and bought my kitties a cat tree](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/7GOe87x). My wife Sara was pissed about how tall it is but y'all paid for it so it needed to be worth it.\n\nWe're working on plans to go visit family in South Carolina. Now that our puppy [Stormbreaker Odinson](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4s5jNjZ.jpg) has his shots we feel comfortable taking him on a trip. We just have to wait for the Florida Corona apocalypse to calm the fuck down.\n\nAs for the bed, it's being back-burnered for now. We measured and don't really have the space for a king in our current room. I know it's only 6 inches wider but that makes a big difference in the room layout. Most of the money will probably go towards the trip to SC anyway.\n\n**I want to say thanks to the mods that manage this awesome community, everyone that donated, everyone that commented with congratulations, everyone that participates in the process and keeps this idea alive. The sun is setting on my time as the winner, and although I didn't quite hit seven figures, I do believe we will make a millionaire one day.**\n\n----\n\nEverything listed should result in direct lines of payment to \/u\/AweBeyCon  \n\nWe ask all users to donate at least $1 USD.

This is so unexpected! And I am so thankful! Just wow!","author":"Unsuitablelake","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/o4vv3r\/winners_thread_67_omg_this_is_so_unexpected_and_i\/","text":"Firstly - WOW. I am blown away. I have bearly slept since I found out and am still trying to digest this and I think it will take some time. After stressful week due to medical issues, seeing me being tagged as a winner, cheered me up quite a bit. And I am so thankful!\n\nSo I will start by introducing myself - my name is Sabine, I am 27 years old. I am happily married and am expecting a baby to join our team soon. It is easy to lose the track of time after you enter the adult life - but 2 years ago I made a decision to finally enter University where I am studying towards Bachelor degree in IT and Design - with a future goal to turn my current hobby of 3D architectual visualisation into a full-time career.  As for now I love making 3D kitchen designs and nursery set designs with a dream, that someday I will be able to make people happy with them.\n\nI try to stay always positive and have always believed that when we as people come together - we can do great and amazing things. The past year has been hard for everyone, including us. As like many people - I lost my job due to pandemic. And for a couple of months we were scraping by,  had limited food reserves and fell behind with our bills. We received help from foodbanks and I am so greatful for that. Ever since then I have been making weekly basket-full donations of food and other necesaties to foodbanks.\n\nCouple of months ago my husband took on a job in another town due to which we had to move 4 hours away from where we lived. Due to costs of moving vans - we simply couldn't afford at that time to move our furniture - so we donated most of to local charity and people in need.  We've been slowly putting money away for furniture since most of the money goes for baby stuff. :) So the money would go towards furniture for us, and bills. I will make sure to put away a  part of the sum to donate towards foodbanks , but not less importantly - I will put another  part of the money for next winner since this community just proves that despite the sad and scary events that are surrounding the world at the moment- there is more good than bad - and as I said previously - when we come together we can do amazing and life-changing things to others in need.  Thank you so so much, it means a lot to us!\n\nEdit [22\/06\/2021]: The last 24 hours have been just mind blowing! I am just so grateful to all of you. In 24 hours i have received in total 1,105 pounds, this is just shocking. And all of the nice messages and encouraging messages - you all have lifted my mood so much. This actually has helped me get the courage to post some of the designs, so thats what im going to do later today, when i get home. You all have taken some burden off my shoulders and I am truly grateful for that. Thank you, thank you, thank you! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\n**Edit 2 [24\/06\/2021]: I can't repeat enough how thankful I am. The total has reached \u00a31250. I could had never hoped to receive this much. I am so thankful that I can't imagine how could I thank you all. This has been an amazing and life-changing experience and has proved me even more that humans are amazing and that we really are good and that we do care for each other even when everyday worries might sometimes sidetrack us. We have used some of the money for furniture -  like dinning table :)) and bought two large shopping carts full of food and hygiene products for local foodbank. You're generosity has really blown me away. For those that might still be thinking to donate - please - spend that money for your local foodbank. Really. Even a loaf of bread or cans of beans or hygiene products might really help someone in trouble. Again - thank you so so so much. You all are so amazing and this experience will always stay in my heart.

Much like any drawing I always had that deep lingering hope it might happen but always tried smothering that with the expectation that it never happens to me, yet here we are!\n\nI'm a 27 year old single dad to an incredible little 5 year old girl. I've had an interesting last few years, 2020 not withstanding. Her mother and I separated back at the start of 2019 a few short months after we bought a house. So suddenly I was without her income, splitting time with our very young daughter, and working full time and then some, in an attempt to keep up on old bills and new and try wrangling all of the debt we carried into the house with us. To put it lightly I had a rough year. I went into 2020 thinking of new beginnings! \"spoilers it was not to be.\"\n\nSince that whole debacle I've mostly settled my life into a decent rhythm, raising my girl, developing my property and working to teach her the importance of living sustainably outside of excess.\n\nThis money will pretty much go towards clearing up some debts, towards my daughters savings account, and finish paying for my final quarter's tuition for this Associates degree I'm finishing. I'll also likely donate a portion of it to a charity or two, as well as paying some forward to next months winner.\n\nI can only express my thanks to anyone who decides to donate and I hope to see this sub continue to grow and give folks this crazy and incredible experience and opportunity. As others have I will update probably over the next week and attempt to give thanks to each individual who's interested in posting to the thread.\n\nThank you!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Update#1**    Hey everyone! I'm going to be calling it a night but can't express how much all of the generosity has meant, its, as I noted in the title, surreal to even win this, but to actually see the notifications from reddit and the donation apps rolling in, is insane. Thank you doesn't do it justice and I hope each and every one of you received 10 fold your generosity in return. I will do my best to catch up on individual thank you's tomorrow!\n\n**Update#2**    Mostly caught up on individual thank yous but this has been incredible everyone, thanks again for each and every donation, no matter the amount it all counts towards the collective efforts and goal of this sub. To those posting in the thread thanks again and to those sending anonymous donations, its all so appreciated thank you.\n\n**Update#3**   And the donations continue to stream in, 2 days later. You guys are incredible and I continue to be in awe of this whole thing, thank you all SO MUCH.\n\n    ***  Everything\u00a0listed\u00a0should\u00a0result\u00a0in\u00a0direct\u00a0lines\u00a0of\u00a0payment\u00a0to\u00a0\/u\/hawk767.\u00a0We\u00a0ask\u00a0all\u00a0users\u00a0to\u00a0donate\u00a0at\u00a0least\u00a0$1\u00a0USD.\u00a0The\u00a0Drawing\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0listed\u00a0for\u00a0users\u00a0who\u00a0want\u00a0to\u00a0see\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0and\u00a0confirm\u00a0the\u00a0validity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0winner. \n    Drawing:\u00a0https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/nj2sfv\/draw_66\/  \n    PayPal:  https:\/\/paypal.me\/TJL767?locale.x=en_US  \n    Venmo:   @Tyler-Long-273\n    Square Cash:  $TJHwK767\n    Bitcoin:  151EwVjK4bzj9RohvCagovSC8DEzggQCAu\n    Bitcoin\u00a0Cash:  bitcoincash:qq47cgafjyy69x0klmupjsxhpga33hku4spgj75sle\n    Ethereum:  0x0954A17E6D0b6de947ba67eC47A5d8514Fd0b17F\n    Dogecoin:  D5fyGpCPzqYdUUjbjBbAhUMnM6ofwyNMEe\n    Nano:   nano_167agbz5afcxn3gmkpzb58no5k4ebabc7kpwh1rxypk7w1nzgfw54ieezcc4","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1621826703.0},{"title":"[Draw #66] You\u2019ve entered, now it\u2019s time to choose our winner!","author":"MakerOfMillionaires","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/nj2sfv\/draw_66_youve_entered_now_its_time_to_choose_our\/","text":"#**Congratulations once again to this year\u2019s graduating class and passing students!**\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR - This post is for the sole purpose of choosing a winner.

I am absolutely nervous with excitement!\n\nI\u2019m a 28 year old male Uni student from Australia. \n\nYou enter these competitions never expecting to win, but boy - when you do..\n\nI\u2019ve recently made some big decisions in my life. This pandemic has been such an eye opener for me. It has made me pull my finger out, and bite the bullet. I have stepped down from full time work to a casual position and have started University. I\u2019m currently studying a bachelor of nursing and cannot wait to get hands on, and actually giving back to the community!\n\nThis means funds are very tight, and we all know how expensive textbooks are. \n\nMost of the donations made through this will ultimately turn into textbooks, furthering my education so that I can go into the field and help others. \n\nPlease leave a comment if you donate, I would absolutely love to thank each and everyone of you! (Even if it takes me a while)\n\nThank you all so much!\n\n***\n\nEdit 1: it\u2019s currently 9pm here in Australia, and I have had a fantastic day. All of you amazing people have donated just over $1000AUD (about $800USD)! \nI went out to lunch with my fianc\u00e9 today to treat myself. It\u2019s raining here, but we are safe from the flooding for now. \nI have just had my content released for my first major Uni assessment and while I\u2019m nervous, I\u2019m still excited! \nYou\u2019ve all made me feel like I have made the right decision to study nursing and give back to my community. I can\u2019t wait to get more hands on and make you all proud when I graduate. \n\nEdit 2: It\u2019s 11pm here and I\u2019ve had a massive day! I\u2019m off to bed. \nThank you again to everyone, it\u2019s been such a wild ride! We have hit about $1200 AUD (about $930 USD). \nI will catch up on all of my thank you\u2019s tomorrow morning. Thank you again all of you amazing wonderful humans!\n\nEdit 3: it\u2019s now 6:30pm on the second day. You have all collectively donated around $2,000 AUD (around $1540 USD) - which is incredible! You are all supporting my education and I\u2019m truly inspired. I love reading all the messages you send via PayPal as well as the little images. As it slows down, I wanted to thank you all once again. I have tried to thank each and everyone of you individually and I hope I didn\u2019t miss anyone! Once again, thank you so much for your support!\n\nEdit : It\u2019s now the 4th day, 07:00am and you guys and girls just haven\u2019t stopped! I am now sitting around $2250 aud ( about $1720usd) which is just mind boggling! \nI went to Uni the other day and I was just so happy. I knew I had made the right decision. So, thank you all so, so very much!\n\nFinal Edit \u270d\ufe0f: what an awesome last few days! I received the biggest donation so far of $124. They didn\u2019t leave a comment that I\u2019m aware of but I wanted to thank you so very much. That was such a kind thing you did. \nThis experience has been AMAZING. I wake up everyday to a few more donation and it makes me start the day with a smile. \nAs the new draw has been announced, I won\u2019t update this thread anymore. \nThe donations got to a whopping $2600 Aud (about $2017 USD)! My last week at Uni has been hectic, I\u2019ve had multiple exams and assignments but I\u2019ve managed to be on top of them all and they\u2019ve all been submitted!\n\n\n\n*** \n\nEverything\u00a0listed\u00a0should\u00a0result\u00a0in\u00a0direct\u00a0lines\u00a0of\u00a0payment\u00a0to\u00a0\/u\/iMythD.\u00a0We\u00a0ask\u00a0all\u00a0users\u00a0to\u00a0donate\u00a0at\u00a0least\u00a0$1\u00a0USD.\u00a0The\u00a0Drawing\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0listed\u00a0for\u00a0users\u00a0who\u00a0want\u00a0to\u00a0see\u00a0the\u00a0results\u00a0and\u00a0confirm\u00a0the\u00a0validity\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0winner.\r\rDrawing:\u00a0https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/m9pg1d\/draw_64\/\n\n(Preferred) PayPal: https:\/\/www.paypal.me\/Lollyback\n\nBTC: \n35m5SRTPPFk5fpzJvwiT5f4sMp7uAH9dVh\n\nETH: 0x9d655b3c58e1ca2f0a5234446e8f8e4a666bae7a\n\nNano: nano_1fbzreoxqo68deg78ndtu8tcmnu1g36xqe8otxhnr8uzzaeynxhm3nzfnsjx\n\nCardano: addr1q9xdcngfg2kkw0rg54z30qdjpfkqy0tks5lvkgw25ygjgnx6s0qr3rpd6asg9nkkvywj79dfn66vjkprgpsm2na8fw8szx9urh\n\nDoge: DQG4VTVK44MaKA9ym6asLPew74PhaQEVUF\n\nBitcoin Cash: bitcoincash:qqemekf5tn3s7ys7k37synw0ujztuq9gavedn9gfxy\n\nLitecoin: MN2cnd7gPx2E96bXvvcqqLHZbJSFtHmThN","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1616371649.0},{"title":"[Draw #64] The comments have been made, it\u2019s time to select the next winner!","author":"MakerOfMillionaires","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/m9pg1d\/draw_64_the_comments_have_been_made_its_time_to\/","text":"#**First time after moving to the moniker [Entry Thread], let\u2019s get set.**\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR - This post is for the sole purpose of choosing a winner.

I am a mother and a grandmother in my mid-fifties, I am disabled with two grown sons and four grandchildren. Three rotten little girls and one handsome boy. I am married to a man that I thought would always be by my side. Up until February of last year I thought my life would always be the same. But, with some things you just have to say enough, done and I can\u2019t do this anymore, for 34 years I suffered through his infidelities along with mental and emotional abuse. I asked him to leave and he did on December 26, 2020. My mom and I scraped together enough change (yes I mean coins) lol to put into a cardboard box too heavy to carry and cash in to put a down payment on my divorce attorney. We called it my \u201cfreedom box\u201d. \nI have this AMAZING support system!  I have my kids, my g-babies, my mom, my niece and nephews and my best friend who is my ex\u2019s sister and her husband. My family is my life. They mean everything to me, my mother and sister in law have been my rocks. For the first time in all of these years I am free, I am ready to live. \nBut I have been so worried.  I have struggled and wondered where my next bit of money is going to come from. My disability check only covers my house payment and my truck payment. This money will hopefully give me a few weeks leeway while I figure out what my next move is. I want to stay in my home, I live next door to one son and his family, my mom lives on another side, my two nephews and niece live on my street as does my aunt and uncle. We are all so close. \nWhen I found out I had been selected I cried. It was surreal, it has given me a newfound sense of hope and has let me exhale and breath a sigh of relief even if for a little while. \nI am beyond humbled and grateful. \n\nEDIT 1. I want to thank each and every single one of you for your support, well wishes and the money you have shared. I started out trying to thank everyone individually, but I couldn\u2019t keep up. And then my Internet went down so I lost my spot. If I have missed your post, your message or a chance to thank you please know I am sorry and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. (Also, my ex\u2019s name is on the PayPal account, but he is in no way part of it, it is solely my own with MY bank account info)\n\nEdit 2:  Thank you again!  Your generosity paid my property taxes, I was able to pay one month ahead on my vehicle and even though stbxh is responsible for my house payment until we are final I was able to pay one month ahead on it. \n\nEdit 3:  Tomorrow is the finalization of my divorce. Nervous jitters, but because of you all it has been somewhat easier.

Every cent makes cents, and counts!\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you chocolate, then imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. You might be able to find love, or if you found it, then you can celebrate it a little further!\n\nA million dollars can make someone\u2019s heart.

I am 27 years old. I'll do my best to make this short and sweet! I'm still shaking from the excitement as I write this.\n\nReading the post about my picking, I see that I was described as \"taking on the role as a lurker\" and \"specialized discussion\". I have to say both of these are spot on. I tend to enjoy being in the background until I find something that I am passionate about. I love to hear other people's opinions before I give my own because each of us has our own story that has helped us to shape said opinions.\n\nWhile 2020 wasn't a particularly fantastic year by any standard, I had a new passion enter my life in the form of my daughter. She took a few extra days in the hospital but is happy (hopefully) and healthy. While I will continue to live and find happiness for myself, I am beyond excited to share the wonders of our world with her. I know the world isn't full of rainbows and butterflies, but I DO know that there are people in this world who can make it worth living. \n\nWhat would I do with the money? The Million (haha) dollar question. I do have bills and a lot of this will definitely be going towards those. That being said, I can't in good mind not do something enjoyable with such a generous gift. Since I haven't been able, I will most definitely be treating my wife in some way, shape, or form. It will definitely be a safe method because we are still conscious of world events. Also, I noticed one of the top comments on the entry page, and due to that comment, I will be making a donation to the American Cancer Society with a potion of the funds that I receive. I don't want to go into the negative portions of my life because that shouldn't be what this is about. My life isn't perfect but I know we all have our struggles that no one can compare. I want to do my part in making someone else's life better.\n\nOne last note because you don't know me and I don't know you. If you don't want to donate to me or if you are unable, that's fine, no hard feelings. If you'd rather tell me that you contributed to a charity, please do! I want you to feel that your contribution is going to something you support.\n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nUpdate 1\/18 (24 Hour): Your generosity is amazing. We've reached almost $1900. My plan is to wait until 1\/25 and will donate, at minimum, 10% of the total. My wife is absolutely stunned at the concept and is grateful for all of you. I would thank each of you individually but I don't want to sound insincere to you each. So Thank You. Truly, truly, thank you.\n\n**Update 1\/25:** It has been just over a week. Once again, thank you to everyone who has given to this awesome experience. As per my previous comment, I donated a portion of what I've received to the American Cancer Society. Today's total, from the different forms of payment, is around $2,200 USD. I hope this year looks up for everyone.

My name is Yasmine and I'm a happy 26-year old from the Netherlands. Let me tell you, this is the most bizarre Christmas gift I've ever received-- and one I never dared to wish for, but secretly wished for a LOT over the past months.\n\n\nI'm all for positivity, staying strong, believing in yourself and supporting my friends & peers. In daily life, I work hard for a sustainable food & water revolution. I feel like it is my task, while I'm here on earth, to do something good and help others wherever possible. That's partially why I hate admitting that 2020 has been an absolute kick in the balls (I don't even have balls). I know it has been for many of you, and that's why I'm hesitant to share my story, but I will, in a nutshell.\n\n\nIn the Netherlands, it's extremely difficult to find an affordable place to live if you wanna live on your own. I was forced to move in January after a shitty breakup but only found a place last month. I've been in different places, burning through all savings trying to live. Bad-luck-bills (car, insurance, whatnot) started to pile up too. It sucks when you work full-time and can barely make it through the month. I'm glad I found a place to live now but I have a buttload to pay off, still, and it caused me sleepless nights and just wore me down.\n\n\nThat's why I'm SO grateful I got randomly selected by mr. blockchain. But I don't want this just to be about me. Let me share my dream with you.\n\n\nThis is something I'm working towards and I *know* I will accomplish in the future. Imagine a mountainous country like Austria, with green hills, pine trees, snow on the mountaintops... yeah. I'll take an (old) house with lots of land for animals (and people) to run around. I'll have 2 or 3 guest rooms so people can stay there, and I will cook for them. That's it. Friends, strangers, weird wanderers, rich Russians - everyone is welcome. You too. When I open my doors, I will let you know, so you can come by for a good meal, great company and a warm bed.\n\n\nI want to care for people. That's where I'll put every cent I don't necessarily need to keep myself alive (and kicking). Please care for the people close to you during these weird holidays. I'm sending you all my love.\n\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nUpdate 22\/12: Whoa, we reached roughly \u20ac2500! My heart is full, THANK YOU, I can pay off some of the sh*tty bills \u00e1nd eat! \n\nUpdate 23\/12: 1) I think I replied to ALL comments. 2) We're close to \u20ac3k!\n\nUpdate 29\/12: over \u20ac3k! (>$3.6k) And I found a new hobby in cryptos.\n\nUpdate 18\/1: last update: thank you SO MUCH for all your kindness. I want to wish everybody in this sub an amazing 2021. Sending you lots of love - you deserve it. Stay safe and take care of yourselves. Hugs!!! \n\n***\n\nEverything listed should result in direct lines of payment to \/u\/AaaaawYeeeeea.

From the impeachment that took place to a currently ongoing election in Georgia (the state), from the missile strike on a foreign leader to the rise of civil rights protests, from the deaths of people that have inspired to those close that we\u2019ve lost, in more ways than one, from the graduates that never got to say goodbye to their friends to the people who are about to lose their homes, this year has been long.\n\nBut like all good things, so too will this year come to an end. Whether or not we\u2019ve grown, learned, or changed, we\u2019ve survived, at least this far. There\u2019s a light at the end of this tunnel, after so long, but it\u2019ll be here. As a matter of fact, I\u2019m looking forward to it. I missed exploring without having to worry for my life and the ones around me, seeing faces and getting to interact with them, getting to play, eat, and celebrate all the wonders of life. I hope I\u2019m not the only one.\n\nThis Christmas season, we\u2019re conducting one final **[Drawing Thread]** of the year, and I hope you\u2019ve been looking forward to it.  Since we\u2019re anticipating a lot of new people here, make sure you have read the rules that follow to qualify for the subreddit. The premise of this subreddit is that, if a million people donate to a single person, we can make a millionaire! Now, we haven\u2019t had a million people, but perhaps today can be a first!\n\nAlso, welcome to anyone and everyone joining in from \/r\/popular! While this event is done monthly, the most activity consistently takes place throughout the holiday season! If this is your first time and you\u2019ve been around Reddit for at least a month, you\u2019re eligible to enter, just make sure you read up on the rules below! For the record, this isn\u2019t a lottery. Entry is free, the winner is funded publicly by the entire community, and the selection process uses blockchain, making it random but verifiable to anyone investigating. This also means we\u2019re always guaranteed to make a winner, that the odds are only as big as the number of people participating, and it could even be you! Anyway, if you decide, make sure you stick around for our monthly threads!\n\n***\n\n**In Case You Missed It:**\n\n \u2022 This is done every month, we will be doing this again starting with January for our 62^nd Drawing and the first [Drawing Thread] of 2021! If you would like to be reminded, set a calendar reminder for January 15 at 6 PM ET, or [click here to be reminded through the RemindMe bot via PM!](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttp%3A%2F%2Freddit.com%2Fr%2FMillionaireMakers%2Fabout%2Fsticky%5D+RemindMe!+January+15+2021+11%3A00+PM+%22Enter+the+%2Fr%2FMillionaireMakers+drawing!%22)\n\n \u2022 I will add a Dropbox text file with all of the dates for 2021 in the upcoming hours. As of now, every **[Drawing Thread]** is scheduled for the third Friday of each month at 23:00 UTC (6 PM ET).\n\n \u2022 Our last winner, \/u\/umerabrar89, is currently accepting donations! An international winner with some hiccups throughout the process, \/u\/umerabrar89 is an expecting father that loves fast food and occasional games. Proceeds have gone to medical bills and hopefully a mortgage.

With that being said, please limit yourself to only one top-level comment.\n\n* The forgiveness period after being announced the winner will be set to one week due to the holidays.

It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few coins. Every cent makes cents, and counts!\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you some nice thoughts for the Christmas season, then imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000.

I am a 30 year old male and soon to be a father. I work as an accountant in a small textile firm. I am a fast food lover, and eating makes me happy. My wife and I are expecting and she is in her third trimester. I try my best to be available for her all the time, but due to my working hours, it gets really hard. Plus, I am working overtime so that we can save enough for all the medical bills that are going to come our way when the little one is due. Thinking about my wife going through the labor pain and all the other complications that may happen scares the hell out of me, and then there is the responsibility of being a good parent. It feels overwhelming. Winning this event has just gave me a lot of hope. This will be a huge help to cover the medical bills and all the other related expenses, plus I can start planning a mortgage of a small house or rent a small place to start a fast food restaurant. Wish me luck. Finally, I would like to thank the [r\/MillionaireMakers](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MillionaireMakers\/) team, the moderators (specially [\/u\/lilfruini](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/u\/lilfruini\/)), and all the people in this community for making this event possible.

In that time, there was a lot of discussion surrounding the legitimacy of the winner.\n\nAs for why the choice was made, [this was explained during the original post,](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/jyrg0w\/draw_60_our_thanksgiving_winner_is_going_to_be\/gd8h0iv\/) but we saw the presence of a verified email trophy and an RPAN trophy, plus the user had activity in some other subreddits, albeit very very small.\n\nWe figured that the 48 hour limit would help determine whether or not this was an alternate account.\n\n***\n\n**What\u2019s going on?**\n\nThe subreddit will once again vote on the winner via Google Forms. We also request that any information regarding the user be shared in the comments.

In the start, I didn\u2019t have the time necessary to commit to making this post, and by the end of the day, I didn\u2019t have the will to work on it. Even so, once it\u2019s published, I feel like no matter what, there are going to be people disappointed in the outcome.\n\nStill, I\u2019d rather continue moderating this subreddit than seeing it die like the moderators before me. I hope that whatever transpires, that it can be met with understanding. Donating is voluntary, and I feel like it\u2019s you all that keeps this community going. That\u2019s what\u2019s making me choose to continue with moderating this subreddit, I truly believe there\u2019s nothing quite like it.\n\nThank you for listening, I hope that this course of action can please the most people from this community. Plus, if you don\u2019t like how things happened here, there\u2019s going to be our Christmas Drawing Thread on December 18, and if stats have shown any indication, this post has our largest rate of participation of the year.\n\nIf you want to make any posts (we\u2019ve had several requests for posting privileges, but I want to remind people that only the winner can officially receive them), please go to \/r\/millionairemakersmeta.

If you commented in this [[Drawing Thread]](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/jxzjl0\/drawing_thread_60_there_are_several_more_days_in\/), you are entered in the drawing and don't need to do anything else. By 16:00 UTC, the winner will be selected. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to pick this winner. This can be verified at any device running Python 3.5, and you do not need to own Bitcoin in order to participate.**\n\n**Additionally, all information to replicate the Drawing at home is available on Dropbox and GitHub, scroll down for more information.**\n\n**Importantly, this post WILL NOT BE EDITED in order to keep the integrity of the Drawing. To verify this, there will not be an asterisk during the time passed since its creation. The winner will be announced in a stickied comment.**\n\n***\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *Some of the information may be unrevised, but procedures are the same as prior draws. Thank you.*\n\n***\n\n**Off Topic:**\n\nThe **[Discussion]** Thread at \/r\/millionairemakersmeta is open. All comments are welcome there for any inquiries.\n\n**[Discussion for Fall and Winter 2020-2021]:** https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakersmeta\/comments\/iw8mse\/_\/\n\n***\n\n**Explanation!**\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #60, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *Draws\/MM60*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\nI will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 12:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to find the winner. Make sure the hash released from the blockchain and the total number of participants match with what is described below. In addition, thank you for your patience.\n\n***\n\n**Information Used For Draw #60:**\n\n    GitHub Repository: https:\/\/github.com\/lilfruini\/CommentGathering-MillionaireMakers\/tree\/master\/Draws\/MM60\n\n    SHA-256 of Comment IDs: d155512bdc24759b0cb6e723f0a0c0a359c074f7cac6e48961d174c4a1f94771\n    SHA-256 of DQed Age: 020584db849d83c75696070c8acf8a80899d7fd6dcc68e4e0513478437da6d7c\n    SHA-256 of Multiple Posters: 71204773b3ee94dd8fc7589af52a938f44e34e220f824925ae70e91c0fe126c2\n    SHA-256 of Truncated IDs: 5b0fd7c8220db4e21f4f80de2ee80e15ebcfca9c0f4e63cd992c5cbdffb1ddd4\n\n    Block Selection: The Third Bitcoin Block After 22 November 2020 - 16:00:00 UTC\n    Total Participants: 6,309","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1606028467.0},{"title":"[Drawing Thread #60] There are several more days in this year to go, and this community\u2019s got some of them scheduled!

I saw a message on Discord from someone and they told me to check my Reddit account. I browse Reddit daily, although I am the definition of a lurker. I saw the messages regarding r\/millionairemakers, and I couldn\u2019t believe it was true. I still can\u2019t.\n\nMy name is Jeremy, and I\u2019m 35 years old. I love playing computer games and spending time with my wife and friends. I work in medical transportation and will be celebrating my sixth wedding anniversary with my beautiful wife Christina in less than a week. We\u2019ve been fighting through this pandemic along with everyone else, and it\u2019s been hard. About 4 years ago, I lost my job and my wife was diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures at the same time, causing both of us to be out of work temporarily. With both of us unable to work, we had to move back in with her parents and we\u2019ve been here ever since. Luckily, we\u2019ve been able to work through the pandemic as her condition has improved dramatically and we\u2019re starting the process of paying off bills we racked up while unemployed.\n\nAnything we receive would go towards paying off the debt we accrued and help with putting a down payment on a home soon. I would also plan on donating to a foundation named after one of my best friends who passed away in 2017 from stage 4 breast cancer- she was diagnosed at the way-too-early age of 30 and fought it bravely for 4 years. I wear pink at least once a week for her.\n\nWe love and miss you Keesha!\n\n\nEDIT 1 - 10\/19 7:16PM CST - You guys are amazing.  This community is amazing.  I told my wife early this morning when all this happened and she didn't really understand it.  I can't wait to tell her tonight how generous this community is.  I'll update this later tonight or tomorrow.  I'm trying to thank everyone directly in comments but I've definitely fallen behind.  I appreciate all of you!\n\nEDIT 2 - 10\/22 9:47am CST - Wow.  We are at just under $2,500.  I worked with a mortgage banker yesterday and we are submitting the final paperwork, but it looks like we're going to be approved for a mortgage!!\n\nEDIT 3 - 11\/4 - Well, just wanted to let you guys know that my wife and I signed an offer to buy a house!  The money we received from you guys pushed us over the top for what we needed for a down payment.  I love everyone in this community, even the trolls posting negative comments :D\n\n\nEverything listed should result in direct lines of payment to \/u\/JerBearGoesRawr.

Luckily, with a little bit of handholding from u\/lilfruini I feel like I\u2019m in pretty good shape (hope your physics went well!!). I have learned SO MUCH, and if nothing else, I\u2019m grateful for that - I honestly had only the dimmest understanding of bitcoin and now I\u2019ve got a bitcoin wallet! What?!?! \n\n\nA bit about me\u2026 Middle aged like I said before. I\u2019m a speech therapist, a plant lover (as has been noted already!), and I have a very rare neurodegenerative disease called Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. It\u2019s a progressive disease, and although nobody would wish for something like that, if you\u2019re going to have a neurodegenerative disease, I pretty much have the very best one.\n\nHonestly, I am pretty lucky. I\u2019m in a profession that I love, a place that I love - all of my needs for shelter, food, safety, companionship are met\u2026 I know that I\u2019m doing better already than so many, and I have so much to be grateful for in my life.\n\nAs to what I plan to do with donations\u2026\nI had a lot of time yesterday to think about it!!! \n\n\nFirst - I need some things for my students - I need a voice amplifier, and some new materials that I can use both in person and for distance learning. If I can find one cheap, I\u2019d also really love to have a second monitor to make teletherapy easier to manage. I\u2019ve already spent so much of my own money on teachers pay teachers and other sites, but there are many more materials and supplies that would help make this challenging school year a little better and easier.\n\n\nSecond - I have my eye on a couple plants - a rubber tree tineke and a manjula pothos\u2026 neither of them are very expensive or rare, I just haven\u2019t felt like I had the leeway in my wallet to treat myself to those recently.\n\n\nAnd last, but certainly not least. This week just happens to be Spastic Paraplegia Awareness Week! The Spastic Paraplegia Foundation (SPF) is the national organization dedicated to advancing research and finding cures for two groups of closely related, progressive neurological disorders (Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia and Primary Lateral Sclerosis). I have been participating in all of the studies available to me - (knowledge is power!) and although I don\u2019t have a lot of money to donate towards research, I certainly don\u2019t mind being a guinea pig in the hopes that someday a treatment or a cure might be found. \nThere are clinical trials going on in Australia *right now* and they\u2019re working on funding to bring trials to the US as well. If any of you are so inclined and want to learn more you can check out sp-foundation.org. \n\n\nThank you to all - and especially again to u\/lilfruini who was an enormous help to me.\n\n**update**\n\nThis has been a crazy 24-ish hours!!\n\nI'm not gonna lie, seeing all the notifications about money coming into my accounts has been exciting, but what's been even more meaningful to me are all the kind words, congratulations, and well wishes from all over the world. \n\nPandemic, and protests, and fires, and everything else going on in the US this summer... It's worn me down... I've been feeling so very tired deep into my bones. All y'all have reminded me that it's not always this way - hope for humanity restored!! :) \n\nMy heart feels full and warm and I sincerely wish that everyone could experience this. It's amazing and even after the money is gone I will remember this feeling.\n\nI'm not a millionaire! ;) \n\nI haven't done the exact math, but I'm a thousandaire for sure. I hope all of you who have donated know that I genuinely appreciate it and I will be certain to put this money to good use. I've tried to keep up with thanking everyone - if I missed you it wasn't intentional (except for that one guy - he was a jerk!!)\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you for giving me this amazing gift. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n***\n\nEverything listed should result in direct lines of payment to \/u\/elle-mnop.

Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will decrease the counter. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the GitHub repository, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #57, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here. Only use the files that are in the GitHub repository.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *MM57*\n\nIf you decide to pursue this path of verification, **DO NOT PREMATURELY ANNOUNCE THE WINNER!** In the event of discrepancies, this can make manners complicated and result in difficult decisions. Doing so will result in a **40-day ban** for the first offense, and continuing offenses could result in a permanent ban. You are welcome to post your results afterwards, and privately contact the moderation team if desired.\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\nI will be reporting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 1:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to find the winner.

This will not be in effect for **[Drawing Thread #56]**.\n\nIf you are interested in discussing this, please head to \/r\/millionairemakersmeta.\n\n* **One account per person per entry:** This one should be obvious, but for clarity\u2019s sake, this will be made official. *You can only use a single account for entry.*\n\nIf there is evidence that arises that suggests the account is a bot or an alternate account, and that the accounts were used to earn multiple entries starting with **[Drawing Thread #56]**, this will result in a consultation with the moderation team, and could lead to a disqualification.\n\n* **The selectee has 48 hours to respond:** As demonstrated in **[Drawing Thread #55]**, failure to respond to an activity check following a personal message will result in a disqualification.\n\nHonestly, this has been an inconsistent rule, sometimes being 48 hours while other times being a full week depending on the winners you choose to ask. There are, and I\u2019m certain there will be occasions where it won\u2019t apply since the winner would\u2019ve already made a comment before our official announcement. Of course, the purpose here is to make it official, much like the rule above.\n\nIn any case, to make sure you get notified, there are many options at your disposal, from using the RemindMe command, to signing up on Discord when the [Draw] gets posted, to simply setting a calendar reminder, and making sure you have notifications enabled on your accounts to be directed to your phone or email address.\n\n***\n\nThe goals of these new rules is to prevent a situation like **[Drawing Thread #55]** from happening again, and for transparency between the mod team and the participants.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, please head over to \/r\/millionairemakersmeta.\n\n***\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nSunday at 12 PM ET (16 UTC), we will be picking our winner, and you won\u2019t want to miss it. The post will be labeled **[Draw]**, and one comment will be selected out of the many made here to make a winner!\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, making an impact, and uniting to make someone's life better. It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few coins. Every cent makes cents, and counts!\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you a mask for obvious reasons, then imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. For starters, you can ~~gamble~~ invest it into the ever-growing stock market.\n\nA million dollars can make someone\u2019s night. Spread the word: have your friends and family comment, post the link to your friendly-neighborhood social media network, and share it to anyone interested.\n\n#**Let\u2019s make a millionaire!**","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1595026904.0},{"title":"[Winner's Thread #55] Looks like the Tooth Fairy is Real!","author":"tirbert","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/hfyedi\/winners_thread_55_looks_like_the_tooth_fairy_is\/","text":"Hello r\/MillionaireMakers!\n\nMy name is Tibor, and I\u2019m just a regular every-day normal guy. Going to be celebrating my 33rd b-day in a couple of weeks, and I could not have wished for a nicer present than this!\n\nI work as a Technical Consultant at a local IT company, where I facilitate data migration into archiving solutions and cloud storage systems. This is every bit as fascinating as it sounds \/s.\n\nIn my free time I enjoy nature, climbing walls, going biking, and if the weather does not let me go out, I spend my time learning about watch complications or mixing techno with my bedroom DJ setup at home, or just watching stupid movies.\n\nDue to an unscheduled dental emergency, I spent most of my week in the dental cabinet, and I was still pumped up on anaesthetics when I got home and opened my laptop to see the news. Surprised is an understatement. The reactions of the people on reddit blew me away, and I tried my best to send a thank-you note to all commenters. Sorry if I missed yours!\n\nI'm sure that the winnings will go mostly to cover my medical bills, but I am going to donate 10% of this to a local org called Beard Brothers. They are knows for funding ambulances and creating great care packages for local orphanages and old folks homes.\n\nI want to thank you all in advance for your donations and positive vibes. You are all amazing! I have to sleep now, it's past 4 Am where I live. What a day...  \n\n**EDIT:** I've been up for a couple of hours now trying to get through all messages and the mountain of notifications. I'm sure this is a once-in-a-lifetime feeling and am trying to ride it while it lasts. I'm overwhelmed by all the positive messages, amazing vibes and b-day wishes. I appreciate all of them. \n\nSince people have been asking, I'll try to add some edits to keep you posted with progress. So far it's ~$500 on PayPal and Revolut combined, and ~$45 in combined crypto. I can't thank you enough! I'll be waiting a few days for things to slow down and really looking forward to making my donation. Everything else is going to fund my pearly whites :)   \n\n**EDIT 2:** Thank you all for your donations and positive vibes! It's end of day one, and things have finally settled down. A total so far would be $990 on PayPal, $31 on Revolut, $54 in Bitcoin, $34 in Bitcoin Cash, $12 Nano, and $10 in Ether! Wooohoo :) Thank you all!!  \n\n\n**EDIT 3:** The weekend has passed, and I was sort of offline while visiting family. A huge Thank You again to everyone that donated, and sorry for the late reply on your comments. New Total is $1120 Paypal, $31 Revolut, $76 BTC, $34 Bitcoin Cash, $16 in Ether and 14.53 Nano. Thank You!!\n\n**EDIT 4:** I have donated $150 to the local org Beard Brothers. Their newest fundraiser is aiming to build a school for the needy around the Cluj-Napoca area. I can happily provide proof of my donation if asked (with a heads-up that all communication in this regards is, unfortunately, in Romanian).  \n\n**EDIT 5:** It's been almost 2 weeks since I posted this, and the new Total would be $1437 on Paypal + Revolut combined and ~ $150 in mixed Crypto. I'll probably hodl the crypto, and the rest is enough to cover a chunk of my dentals. (not bad, for a random comment on Reddit). Thank you to everyone who donated, and everyone that sent congrats! :) \n\n\n**EDIT 6** Some (final?) statistics from me after this very interesting and awesome experience. I received ~$70 since my last edit, making the new total a pretty round $1500 on Paypal and Revolut combined, and ~$150 in combined crypto. I want to thank the (approximately) 400 redditors who donated, and I really hope that I was able to reply to all of you kind enough to comment in here. This was truly an unexpected surprise, made more amazing by each and every one of you!  \n\nP.S.

A winner would be picked, and they would make a post.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not what has happened. The winner was accused of being a throwaway account made for the purpose of rigging the [Draw] in their favor. This is evidenced by a post made asking if moderators had any tools to prevent multiple accounts from posting, and overall having *just enough* history to be eligible.\n\nSo then, the moderation team has made the controversial decision to assign the user the winner, as seen right here: https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/hd94db\/_\/fvm38y4\/\n\nNow, it may not be clear, but we also require our winners to make a response to our messages within two days.

The next five blocks led to 635721, and this is the block that is being used to pick the next winner.\n\nIf you want to do this for yourself, go to the `meta.json` file and change `\"WaitTillBlock\": 3` to `\"WaitTillBlock\": 8`, adding five additional blocks.\n\n**What are the results?**\n\n    Total Participants: 5381\n    Winner: 4925\n    Hash: 0000000000000000000a5d39330b92ad60b102e3cadbb58d3e1d2eb25b08c7f8\n\n    Winner_ID: fvgm222\n    Winner_Link: https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/hcass3\/drawing_thread_55\/fvgm222\n    Winner: tirbert\n\n**\/u\/tirbert is now our 55^th winner here at \/r\/MillionaireMakers.**\n\n\/u\/tirbert has donated in the past, engaged in prior discussion, and participated in many raffles. Notably, \/u\/tirbert has had a seven-year history at Reddit, and participated in the April Fools\u2019 Sequence event.\n\n\/u\/tirbert will still need to demonstrate activity within the next 48 hours, but I\u2019m much more confident it\u2019ll be able to be done. Like before, donations are voluntary, and if people are dissatisfied with the response, they are able to voice their concerns in the comments.\n\n**How can we make sure this never happens again?**\n\nI\u2019m not really sure myself, some people here can believe we got lucky, but this won\u2019t be the last time people try to cheat the system.\n\n1) This subreddit needs more guidelines on who could possibly be a winner. Sometimes, there are people who genuinely join Reddit so they can be able to participate in this subreddit, but also with it comes people who want to take advantage of the system so they could get money.\n\n2) There needs to be more participants. The amount of people that participated was the lowest it\u2019s been since November. Simply, the odds of an ordinary person winning would be much higher simply because they are more available in abundance.\n\nI am looking for suggestions, both here or at \/r\/millionairemakersmeta (posts are allowed over there), for the best things to do going forward.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1593093671.0},{"title":"Your entries have been made, it\u2019s time to pick a winner!

Quarantine has been making this subreddit more popular by the day, so thank you to everyone for supporting this. \n\nFor those who aren't familiar:\n\n* Every month, we ask for comments for entry, and we pick one who represents our winner.\n* This process is completely random and verifiable, using the Bitcoin blockchain as a sophisticated die.\n* Following this, people then donate to the winner using a variety of mediums, and the winner would go on to be a \"millionaire\" (arguably, our definition of that term is pretty loose).\n\nAlso, I want to clarify on the situation with comments: you need to make *only one* top-level comment. You can reply as many times as you like. However! If you haven\u2019t made a comment **DIRECTLY** to this post, you will not be counted. I\u2019ve attached a helpful graphic visually clarifying the difference between a top-level comment and a reply right here: https:\/\/imgur.com\/Si1VLX4\n\nSo once again, thank you for your support. The post lasts for 24 hours before getting locked, so make sure you place your comment before 7 PM ET. In addition, I will make a **[Part 2]** if we reach the limit, and changing some past precedent, I will extend comment collection by a full day. **Let's make a millionaire!**\n\n***\n\n**In Case You Missed It:**\n\n* This is done every month, we will be doing this again in June 19 and every third Friday in 2020!

Im really grateful for all of this.\n\nYesterday I was at my phone and suddenly got plenty of notifications on Reddit, when I oppened app I coudnt believe it. I was shocked, of course I never expected to win such a thing,but it happened,to me, in right time.\n\nThis year started really rought for me. Two months passed since I found out that my girlfriend of almost 7 years cheated on me, I writed a [post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/f5vrm9\/my_heart_is_broken_im_going_to_kill_myself\/) and few [comments](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/fn6m2u\/my_boyfriend_recently_cheated_and_im_torturing\/flan5ph\/?context=3) on other subreddits, so if someone is intrested in my situation and wants to help, feel free to check. Since then, Im not the same. I lost self-confidence, I was suicidal, coudn't sleep or eat and maybe worst of all I didn't have someone to talk to. After that, the world was hit by a COVID-19 and like everyone else, I must stay at home with my thoughts without even going to college or walk outside with friend. But, enough about me, I wish you all to stay safe, take care of your family and help those who need it,we are all in this together!\n\nWhen I found out that I won, I started shaking, maybe this is one of many good things that from now my life will get me. I'm not gonna lie, tears in my eyes started to come.\n\nI'm really humble person, I dont need much in life,I will probably use some money to invest in me(to feel better in my own skin,some clothes maybe to get that self confidence I lost \u2639 ) and rest of it will go to help others.\n\nTo be honest I don't know how much people get from this, but everything will help. I have saved some money and I always wanted to suprise my family with some car, maybe this is opportunity to dream come true. Also, since my mum and me sometimes volunteer at our local dogs shelter I want to suprise them with some food,toys, blankets,etc. Please take care of your loved ones, talk with them and show some love.

All comments are welcome there for any inquiries.\n\n**[Discussion for Spring and Summer 2020]:** https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakersmeta\/comments\/g3a53t\/_\/\n\n***\n\n**Explanation!**\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00:00 UTC, then it will, simple. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the Dropbox folder, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Standard Protocol:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #53, upload the file of choice to a SHA-256 generator, and match it with its respective hash output. The result you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3.5 or better and follow the path to the folder labeled: *MM53*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\nI will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 1:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you will be able to find the winner. Make sure the hash released from the blockchain and the total number of participants match with what is described below.

However, it is the largest platform used by \/r\/MillionaireMakers, and is the provider of most donations on this subreddit.\n\nThis survey is purely to see how people feel about this. Unless if the winner chooses to not accept PayPal, we will continue to offer this service for tonight\u2019s thread.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) How would you feel about a ban on the PayPal service here on \/r\/MillionaireMakers?\n\n2) Would removing PayPal as a service affect your ability to donate?\n\n3) Should \/r\/MillionaireMakers remove PayPal?\n\nI will periodically post results here.

The post will be labeled **[Draw]**, and one comment will be selected out of the many made here to make a winner!\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, making an impact, and uniting to make someone's life better. It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few coins. Every cent makes cents, and counts!\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you a mask for obvious reasons, then imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. You can get a full-body suit, new doors, and someone to love you! Admittedly, for the wrong reasons, but the option is there.\n\nA million dollars can make someone\u2019s suffering less sufferable.

When I noticed this, I gathered the comments at 9 AM ET, which is pretty close to the deadline.\n\nSecond, I haven't used a PC, Mac, or any other reasonable piece of desktop hardware to run a Python script in years. If it's not through Repl.it on my iPad, it's through Pydroid 3 on my LG V30. I couldn't figure out a way to efficiently run the scripts on Repl.it on my iPad, and as for my phone, it didn't want to parse through the authors. Also, the software I used is Python 3.7, while leroy627 stated it required the use of Python 3.8.\n\nIn other words, I wasn't able to fully follow through the process of running the scripts due to hardware restraints and lack of the necessary software. [I received this error when running *getAuthors.py*, but I'm not having it stop us.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/vB1PHaX)\n\nThird, it's just a culmination of real-life conflicts. I honestly hate having to delay the **[Draw]** post, but otherwise, I hope everything is fine.\n\n**What does this mean for you all?**\n\nWhat happens is that the process of picking the winner is delayed, but not for much longer than what is standard. Also, potential winners will be manually disqualified after an unsuccessful vetting of their account, rather than having it be done automatically, if it comes to that. \n\n**The Solution**\n\nThe comments have already been collected, we're just going to go through the process that has been established in **[Draw #49]** and **[Draw #39]**, just with the software usable that's on GitHub (save for *getAuthors.py* and *removeInvalids.py*, unless if a fix is possible).

I\u2019ve since then uploaded it to GitHub from its lonely home over at Dropbox, and some wonderful people have updated it. These programmers are the reason that this subreddit hasn\u2019t gone into a year-long hiatus, and words don\u2019t do justice to the work they\u2019ve done.\n\nThis month, a user surprised me by completely transforming the collection process! This user goes by leroy627, and updated the process. I\u2019ve told him that it\u2019s be used this month of February, and he took the time to make many more additions, including a ReadMe, potential samples of other **[Drawing Thread]** posts had it been used, and some quality of life changes.\n\n*So, what does it do?*\n\n* All of the data that is manually inserted goes in a separate file, thus reducing the potential risk of overwriting the code.\n* The SHA-256 hash is added automatically, a series of characters that confirms I didn\u2019t tamper with a text.\n* It removes deleted comments and comments that don\u2019t meet the age requirement (in this case, January 22 at 6:00 PM ET).\n* It also has the option to remove comments that have double-posted. For the month of February, the first comment will be kept.\n* The winner is retrieved automatically.

All I can say is thank you, to the creators of this sub, the moderators, and every member here too. \n\nA little bit about me:  I am a full time student in college and I work full time as well, which means I really don\u2019t have much free time.  I work for an automotive manufacturer, but it is not where I want to be forever (or much longer tbh). Currently, I am attending school to get a degree in Emergency Management, and I would love to work in the disaster relief field helping those who have been through major disasters and catastrophes. \n\nBecause all of this is so unexpected, and I really want to make good use of the proceeds here, I am going to do things a little differently.  **I will donate 50% of everything you guys send in the next week directly to the Australian Red Cross to help provide relief for the refugees and victims of the 2019-2020 fires.** I will provide proof of all donations in one week. \n\nAll listed payment methods below will go directly to me, and then I will divide the winnings in half and donate it on behalf of the r\/MillionaireMakers community. \n\nThank you all again for being such a wonderful part of this community.

If you commented in the [[Drawing Thread]](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/eq81a8\/happy_2020_rmillionairemakers_is_celebrating_its\/), you are entered in the drawing and don't need to do anything else. By 16:00 UTC, the winner will be selected. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to pick this winner. This can be verified at any device running Python 3.7, and you do not need to own Bitcoin in order to participate.**\n\n**Additionally, all information to replicate the Drawing at home is available on Dropbox, scroll down for more information.**\n\n**Importantly, this post WILL NOT BE EDITED in order to keep the integrity of the Drawing. To verify this, there will not be an asterisk near the time passed since its creation. The winner will be announced in a stickied comment.**\n\n***\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *Some of the information may be unrevised, but procedures are the same as prior draws. Thank you.*\n\n***\n\n**Off Topic:**\n\nThe **[Discussion]** Thread at \/r\/millionairemakersmeta is open. All comments are welcome there for any inquiries.\n\n**[Discussion #50]:** https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakersmeta\/comments\/eqxure\/happy_january_heres_the_post_for_all_your_50\/?\n\n***\n\n**Quick Update:**\n\nFebruary, there will be changes on how the [Draw] here is going to run. I\u2019ll announce more information when the time comes, but for now, if any programmers are interested in what\u2019s happening, please visit the GitHub repository (hopefully my vocabulary is accurate). People are welcome to make contributions at their leisure!\n\nGitHub Link: https:\/\/github.com\/lilfruini\/CommentGathering-MillionaireMakers\n\n***\n\n**Explanation!**\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00 UTC, then it will, simple. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the Dropbox folder, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Awareness for Fairness:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #47, remove the first two lines, and upload the file to a SHA-256 generator, or upload one of the three trial runs. The output you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3 and follow the path to the text file here: *MM50\\Drawing\\OfficialMM50IDs.txt*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\nI will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 2:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you should also be able to find the winner. Make sure the hash released from the blockchain and the total number of participants match with what is described below.\n\nI will add, after 12:30 PM ET, I will be temporarily unavailable, and the hash could be released by then. Please be patient, and thank you.\n\n***\n\n**Information Used For Draw #50:**\n\n    Dropbox Folder: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/sh\/iqxp2k1ntgf1eh0\/AAADgaguZPmD11cxf1pTXIaJa?dl=0\n    SHA-256 (hash.online-convert.com): 1a0e13dd49cd1a43e3b1fe89ffa298b949c43d56f356cfc2d37f4feec0fa9567\n\n    Python PRAW Code: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/e14jnwgdksrccd4\/%28ALTERED%29%20MM%20Comment%20IDs%20Retrieval%20via%20PRAW.py?dl=0\n    Python Duplicate Code: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/twvche11eigu4j3\/DuplicateAuthentication.py?dl=0\n    Python Selection Code: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/76zuh5xpfwfh8ps\/MillionaireMakersDrawingCode.py?dl=0\n    Comment IDs' Text: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/z3gwfvvtnk8fgn4\/OfficialMM50IDs.txt?dl=0\n\n    Block Selection: The Third Bitcoin Block After 19 January 2019 - 16:00:00 UTC\n    Total Participants: 82,393\n\n***\n\n*Snowy winter nights.*\n\n*Comfort found, with home around.*\n\n*White lights in strong sights.*","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1579449066.0},{"title":"Happy 2020! \/r\/MillionaireMakers is celebrating its 50th Drawing Thread today, and we\u2019re glad you can join us!

From the moment I came across it, I have been participating in Millionaire Makers. It has been about a year now(may have missed a month or two somewhere in there) and I have really enjoyed that we have been able to make impacts on people's lives all based around people donating out of good faith. I woke up Sunday morning and was playing some Destiny 2 with a buddy. During some downtime between missions I decided to open Reddit and what do you know, I have a message. It is such an overwhelming feeling to be selected and it was certainly unexpected.\n\nA little about me! I\u2019m a full-time college student who is beginning to study computer science. I work two part-time jobs and love to game in my downtime. This winter I am starting some training to be a volunteer ski patrol member with my local ski resort and I couldn\u2019t be more excited for that. I intend to save all winnings and will be putting them towards paying for my next home when January rolls around. I have been fortunate enough to live in a place rent-free besides utilities for the past few months. This has really come at an important time when money is becoming tighter.  Any leftover funds will sit in savings until I need them and of course my monthly Millionaire Maker donations. Thank you all so much!\n\nI am limited on hard drive space to store chains for all the different bitcoin forks. I apologize if I am not using one you would prefer and understand if you are unable to contribute because of it.\n\nDrawing: https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/dxngy4\/draw_48\/\n\nThank you to all who are able to contribute!\n\nEdit: Busy day for me today but I just want to thank you all so much again!

Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00 UTC, then it will, simple. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the Dropbox folder, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Awareness for Fairness:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #48, remove the first two lines, and upload the file to a SHA-256 generator, or upload one of the three trial runs. The output you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3 and follow the path to the text file here: *MM48\\Drawing\\OfficialMM48IDs.txt*\n\n***\n\n**Status Reports:**\n\nI will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via the comments, so other users can keep track of the progress. These comments will be pinned at the top of the post and be distinguished. Most likely, after 2:00 PM ET, the pinned comment will be announcing the winner.\n\nIf you can run Python yourself and follow the instructions, you should also be able to find the winner. Make sure the hash released from the blockchain and the total number of participants match with what is described below.\n\n***\n\n**Information Used For Draw #48:**\n\n    Dropbox Folder: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/sh\/jbv48uvdkwgc0ur\/AAA5pHLtHdvksnsgZIdx8WS0a?dl=0\n    SHA-256 (hash.online-convert.com): edd3d0c462e37ec609c22879a6436427fbd32db8a99ad4e9e2d27382918e30ab\n\n    Python PRAW Code: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/21vmoyvomyygmof\/%28ALTERED%29%20MM%20Comment%20IDs%20Retrieval%20via%20PRAW.py?dl=0\n    Python Selection Code: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/09krpkfvj84zqmi\/MillionaireMakersDrawingCode.py?dl=0\n    Comment IDs' Text: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/yq8yrla8kn3ye4y\/OfficialMM48IDs.txt?dl=0\n\n    Block Selection: The Third Bitcoin Block After 17 November 2019 - 16:00:00 UTC\n    Total Participants: 3,716\n\n***","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1574002689.0},{"title":"Thanksgiving magic is in the air! ...wait.

Some contested whether the winner was considered an alternate account. Others stated that the subreddit\u2019s rules were too vague on what constitutes considerable activity.\n\nI have privately contacted \/u\/dubbois, and gave him two methods to verify himself:\n\n* Using Credo360 to establish credibility, or...\n\n* Providing IP logins, upvote history, and deleted comments.\n\n\/u\/dubbois chose the former, which you can see here: https:\/\/www.credo360.com\/reddit\/dubbois\n\nHe has also told me the funds would be donated to charity and towards his local SPCA. Currently, he is offering to surrender his status to the runner-up.\n\nDespite that, it\u2019s still a difficult position. As stated, there were few comments at the time of being picked. If this doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201cminimal account activity\u201d, then a new winner should be redrawn. However, he still beat the odds, consisting of 1\/3,304, and to rob a user of that because they don\u2019t make enough comments creates a weird gray area, one that I believe I can\u2019t make the judgement for correctly.\n\nEven then, another winner could always be picked, which according to the FAQ, is block 596109. This winner could possibly be more deserving of the subreddit, but the same argument to not pick \/u\/dubbois applies: someone more deserving of winning could be robbed of it.\n\nThere is a third option: have two winners. While this means both parties are satisfied, it also establishes something unprecedented for \/r\/MillionaireMakers, as well as divide donations between the two users.\n\nThis conflict is what led me to you, the noble Redditor, to stand tall and cast a vote. **Should \/u\/dubbois be crowned a winner? Should a new one be redrawn? Should we create a first and have two winners?**\n\nThe fate of the would-be champion rests on your shoulders: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSemH1QdLa1fE5jihG8byK5JlD36pRKTITFxQOtlRpy_lois8A\/viewform?usp=sf_link\n\n**Please vote!

Most of the content has been moved over to \/r\/millionairemakersmeta, and is the first thing you\u2019ll see, stickied to the front page. This change gives two big benefits:\n\n1) People who misunderstood a certain part of an answer can now ask for clarification without fear of wasting their entry comment or having said comment get lost in the void.\n\n2) The **[Drawing Thread]** itself is less cluttered. Now, it is divided into five sections: \u201cIn Case You Missed It,\u201d \u201cInformation,\u201d \u201cMajor Announcements\u201d (if any), \u201cTimeline\u201d (if fulfilled, will be performed in July), and \u201cConclusion.\u201d Long gone are the days of looking through clutter, and taking its place are organized sections with information in each one, for both regulars and newcomers.\n\n[If you would like to see the FAQs, click here](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakersmeta\/comments\/c2zaye\/_\/) or head to \/r\/millionairemakersmeta (it should be the first post you see).\n\n**Fan Art Contest:**\n\nOur Reddit redesign presence is non-existent, other than the green color. That\u2019s why we\u2019re holding the subreddit\u2019s first **Fan Art Contest!** There will be one winner. Submissions start today, and will end on July 19 at 3:59 UTC (11:59 PM ET). Voting will officially begin July 19 at 23:00 UTC (although the thread may be posted earlier), and the highest upvoted post will be the banner\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n\n1) The recommended file size is 4000x128 pixels, but can be adjusted.\n\n2) The banner *MUST BE* related to \/r\/millionairemakers in order to qualify for the contest.\n\n3) The banner must be submitted to \/r\/millionairemakersmeta with **[Contest]** in the title. Failure to do so may result in your submission not showing up in the search results and, as a result, the voting phase.\n\n4) No low quality drawings or Microsoft Paint submissions.\n\n5) Watermarks and username inclusions are acceptable, but do not make it too blatant. Your art will be presented as it was submitted during Reddit voting.\n\n6) During voting, your art will be presented with your username, the link to the submission, and a direct link to the art itself. Additionally, you can choose to add a description by posting in the comments. The expectation is that it is around 300 characters, meaning if it is too long, the mods have the liberty to shorten it.\n\n7) Voting will be done in a separate thread through Contest Mode and locked, meaning that votes will be hidden from the public to hinder vote brigading. Additionally, the thread will be locked so as only entries are present in the comments. Voting will end following a week from July\u2019s Drawing, July 26 at 23:00 UTC (7 PM ET).\n\nAll rules are subject to change as time goes on, and will be made definite when voting begins.\n\nIf possible, I would like feedback on the event and rules, and [would love to hear it in the \/r\/millionairemakersmeta **[Discussion Thread]**](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakersmeta\/comments\/c3hr8y\/surely_youve_seen_the_drawing_thread_theres_a_new\/).\n\n**Things to Come:**\n\nBy the way, I\u2019ve been talking with some people on how to change the way we retrieve comments. There may be an experimental thread that utilizes one of the newer methods, as soon as July. Stay tuned!\n\n***\n\n#**Conclusion**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, making history, and coming together to make someone's life better. It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few pennies. Every cent counts.\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you a mint, imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. You can go to a theme park, buy an 8K TV, or purchase an Apple Pro Stand!\n\nA million dollars can help make someone\u2019s summer. Spread the word: have your friends and family comment, post the link to your friendly-neighborhood social media network, and share it to anyone interested.\n\n**Let's tan a millionaire!**\n\n***\n\n*It\u2019s the time of change.*\n\n*Summer\u2019s fun has just begun.*\n\n*Goodbye, dear spring time.*","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1561158036.0},{"title":"I have been blessed [Winner\u2019s Thread #42]","author":"livo23","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/br2ni8\/i_have_been_blessed_winners_thread_42\/","text":"Hey guys, first of all thank you all very much for the kind messages\n\nI'm just a normal guy without any kind of special story, 26 years old and recently started my career overseas after spending some years in, and graduated, university.\n\nI'm usually lurking on reddit reading through my favorite subs to get some time away from my daily routine life.\n\nPretty much like every other guy on here I guess.\n\nWhat can I say, I am super greatful for the opportunities this sub gives out every month, and this time I got lucky.\n\nI hope one of you guys win next time and I can give something back to you\n\nNow, what am I going to spend the money on?\n\nI really am not sure.

If you commented in the [[Drawing Thread]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/b1lgf3\/were_springing_into_a_new_season_and_with_it_a), you are entered in the drawing and don't need to do anything else. By 16:00 UTC (less than an hour as of posting this), the winner will be selected. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to pick this winner. This can be verified at any device running Python 3.7, and you do not need to own Bitcoin in order to participate.**\n\n**Additionally, all information to replicate the Drawing at home is available on Dropbox, scroll down for more information.**\n\n**Importantly, this post WILL NOT BE EDITED in order to keep the integrity of the Drawing. To verify this, there will not be an asterisk near the time passed since its creation. The winner will be announced in a stickied comment.**\n\n***\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *Some of the information may be unrevised, but procedures are the same as prior draws. Thank you.*\n\n***\n\n*Explanation!**\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00 UTC, then it will, simple. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the Dropbox folder, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Awareness for Fairness:**\n\n*This post will not be edited!* This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #42, remove the first two lines, and upload the file to a SHA-256 generator. The hash you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3 and follow the path to the text file here: *MillionaireMakers Drawing #42\\Drawing\\OfficialMM42IDs.txt*\n\n***\n\n**No Stream:**\n\nThere won't be a stream today, due to a personal scheduling conflict.\n\nInstead, I will be commenting on the progress of the drawing via a timeline, so other users can keep track of the progress.\n\n***\n\n**Information Used For Draw #42:**\n\nDropbox Folder: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/sh\/2azfrpixpij079u\/AACKZRCdrKvzREVt_yUR7xHDa?dl=0\nSHA-256 (hash.online-convert.com): bad926f43c716213c6bf2754bf14716781bbeadc8c4ed9de6f3b3e9d4cb06197\n\nPython PRAW Code: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/l4jixqylxx965tf\/%28ALTERED%29%20MM%20Comment%20IDs%20Retrieval%20via%20PRAW.py?dl=0\nPython Selection Code: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/bevdemsa6e1uqlb\/MillionaireMakersDrawingCode.py?dl=0\nComment IDs' Text: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/d8jozuuy6avrdmd\/OfficialMM42IDs.txt?dl=0\n\nBlock Selection: The Third Block After 19 May 2019 - 16:00:00 UTC\nTotal Participants: OH CRAP I DON\u2019T KNOW\n\n***","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1558281703.0},{"title":"Exam week is almost over, and with it comes making a millionaire!

In the long term, that\u2019s $120 every **decade**, which is much more affordable than other expenses. How does it work? Below, you will find an explanation on entering, rules to keep in mind, the selection, and other important things to note.\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n* REQUIRED: Leave only **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. It is highly recommended to comment \"`RemindMe! 3 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers`\", which will remind you via PM to donate. *That's it!*\n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only **ONE** top level comment per person *(replies and subsequent-level comments aren't included)*, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment.\n\n* If, by any chance, you do double comment, **delete any extra duplicates ASAP, ideally before the thread is locked, as any chosen draws found to violate this will not be eligible to win, and will be banned from the subreddit.**\n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After 24 hours, this thread will close, and the method of selection will begin.\n* While attempts to make the selection method similar to 2017\u2019s have been performed, it still varies from the original. For an example from a prior drawing, see **[[Draw #36]]( https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/9y71hn\/i_would_make_a_thanksgiving_joke_but_im_not\/)**. For archival purposes, please [click here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/) for the original selection method.\n* **Method's TL;DR:** Your number is assigned by sorting the comments by old, resulting in the first commenter being 1. The list of comments will be publicly released for the community to verify per their own accord. The subreddit then waits for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, after a preselected date and time, and calculates the winner using a formula described in the posts mentioned above.\n* ~~Comment IDs are downloaded at 2:00 UTC, three hours following the thread being locked.~~ *(See addendum above.)* There will be an official run at the time listed. **If it is shown that there are any technical difficulties, the retrieval of the comments will be delayed by an hour, following the same procedures.**\n* While not necessary, to determine if you are on the list, please go to your comment and save it. The comment ID is what gets recorded and selected, which looks like this: `e3yxpj4`.\n* The Draw is held at 16:00 UTC the Sunday after comments have been downloaded, unless stated otherwise. Using the Bitcoin blockchain, the third block yet to be mined will be used to select a winner.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for their chosen payment methods (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire! A donation table will be stickied to the winner\u2019s post, giving users the freedom in how they donate.\n* The lucky Redditor follows up with a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal, Square Cash, and Google Wallet account, and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. *(Note: Some services may not be available depending on where you reside.)*\n* To buy any cryptocurrencies, you may use [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* To store cryptocurrencies, there are many accessible wallets, and if you win, you will be guided on which ones to download. For Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, it\u2019s recommended to use the [Electrum](https:\/\/electrum.org\/#home) and [Electron Cash](https:\/\/electroncash.org\/index.html) wallet for Mac, Linux, and PC.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment \"`RemindMe! 3 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers`\".\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a correlation between this subreddit making it in \/r\/all and an increase in donations.\n* Try to cross-post to relevant subs, and upvote. There is a correlation between reaching \/r\/all and the amount of donations for the winner. *(Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here.)*\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, making history, and coming together to make someone's life better. It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few pennies. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: **This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter.** No prizes are given away directly by the moderators of this subreddit *(the moderators will never even touch your donations; this is done voluntarily)*. As for gift taxes, according to the IRS, they're paid by the donor, and any donations under $15,000 is not taxable.\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you a pencil, imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. You can get preparation books, prepare for college, or even raise money for a graduation party!\n\nOne million dollars can help do things. Spread the word: have your friends and family comment, post the link to your friendly-neighborhood social media network, and share it to anyone interested.\n\n**Let's make a millionaire!**","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1558134008.0},{"title":"It's an Easter Miracle!","author":"lereisn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/bg1c7o\/its_an_easter_miracle\/","text":"Waking up at 7.30am on a bank holiday morning is not a great start to a day off work.\n\nReading the multiple messages from wellwishers at 7.31am congratulating you on winning the millionairemaker draw is *the* best way to start any day. \n\nIm dumbfounded!!\n\nHey,  everyone, Im u\/Lereisn and im your 41st winner!!\n\nIm a 41yr old dude from England (41!

In the long term, that\u2019s $120 every **decade**, which is much more affordable than other expenses. How does it work? Below, you will find an explanation on entering, rules to keep in mind, the selection, and other important things to note.\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n* REQUIRED: Leave only **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. It is highly recommended to comment \"`RemindMe! 3 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers`\", which will remind you via PM to donate. *That's it!*\n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only **ONE** top level comment per person *(replies and subsequent-level comments aren't included)*, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment.\n\n* If, by any chance, you do double comment, **delete any extra duplicates ASAP, ideally before the thread is locked, as any chosen draws found to violate this will not be eligible to win, and will be banned from the subreddit.**\n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After 24 hours, this thread will close, and the method of selection will begin.\n* While attempts to make the selection method similar to 2017\u2019s have been performed, it still varies from the original. For an example from a prior drawing, see **[[Draw #36]]( https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/9y71hn\/i_would_make_a_thanksgiving_joke_but_im_not\/)**. For archival purposes, please [click here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/) for the original selection method.\n* **Method's TL;DR:** Your number is assigned by sorting the comments by old, resulting in the first commenter being 1. The list of comments will be publicly released for the community to verify per their own accord. The subreddit then waits for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, after a preselected date and time, and calculates the winner using a formula described in the posts mentioned above.\n* Comment IDs are downloaded at 2:00 UTC, three hours following the thread being locked. There will be an official run at the time listed. **If it is shown that there are any technical difficulties, the retrieval of the comments will be delayed by an hour, following the same procedures.**\n* While not necessary, to determine if you are on the list, please go to your comment and save it. The comment ID is what gets recorded and selected, which looks like this: `e3yxpj4`.\n* The Draw is held at 16:00 UTC the Sunday after comments have been downloaded, unless stated otherwise. Using the Bitcoin blockchain, the third block yet to be mined will be used to select a winner.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for their chosen payment methods (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire! A donation table will be stickied to the winner\u2019s post, giving users the freedom in how they donate.\n* The lucky Redditor follows up with a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal, Square Cash, and Google Wallet account, and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. *(Note: Some services may not be available depending on where you reside.)*\n* To buy any cryptocurrencies, you may use [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* To store cryptocurrencies, there are many accessible wallets, and if you win, you will be guided on which ones to download. For Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, it\u2019s recommended to use the [Electrum](https:\/\/electrum.org\/#home) and [Electron Cash](https:\/\/electroncash.org\/index.html) wallet for Mac, Linux, and PC.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment \"`RemindMe! 3 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers`\".\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a correlation between this subreddit making it in \/r\/all and an increase in donations.\n* Try to cross-post to relevant subs, and upvote. There is a correlation between reaching \/r\/all and the amount of donations for the winner. *(Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here.)*\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, making history, and coming together to make someone's life better. It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few pennies. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: **This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter.** No prizes are given away directly by the moderators of this subreddit *(the moderators will never even touch your donations; this is done voluntarily)*. As for gift taxes, according to the IRS, they're paid by the donor, and any donations under $15,000 is not taxable.\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you stuff, imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. You can get stuff, stuff, and stuff!\n\nOne million dollars can help do things. Spread the word: have your friends and family comment, post the link to your friendly-neighborhood social media network, and share it to anyone interested.\n\n**Let's make an egg-cellent millionaire!**\n\nhaiku\n\n(This is an altered generic template thread.)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1555715864.0},{"title":"We\u2019re making some million-dollar refinements!

A separate subreddit grants users active discussion and appeals to first time visitors curious about \/r\/MillionaireMakers.\n\n \n\n*Will there be any events?* Actually, yes. One of which is a fan-art contest that\u2019ll start in summer and run seasonally. The top three pieces get to be June\u2019s, July\u2019s, and August\u2019s subreddit banner, and featured in said month\u2019s **[Drawing Thread]**.  Artists will get full credit for their work, although I can\u2019t guarantee any monetary prizes. This is still tentative, but it should be a nice change of pace from the standard planet icon over at Reddit\u2019s newer version.\n\n \n\nAs of right now, the subreddit is claimed, but the stylesheet seen through *old.reddit.com* has not been implemented. Additionally, I haven\u2019t invited the other mods yet, so please be patient. However, you are welcome to post there as developments occur.\n\n \n\n#**Redesigning \u201cFormer Millionaire Threads \u201d:**\n\n \n\nI\u2019ve changed the design of the sidebar, notably the list of winners. Every winners\u2019 username handle now takes the place of a link to their winning post, and it\u2019s clear from a glance who won and when. **[Draw]** threads have been removed, and that\u2019s because the sidebar has a character limit, in addition to minimizing clutter in the sidebar. I\u2019ll post the list of **[Draw]** posts on \/r\/MillionaireMakersMeta at some point in the future. All upcoming winners will have a hyperlink to the **[Draw]** thread that they respectively won within their winning post.\n\n \n\nReally, it\u2019s just redesigning. If you don\u2019t like it, let me know. It\u2019s still incomplete.\n\n\n#*April Fools Footnote:*\n\n \n\nI wanted to add in this announcement that I originally planned for an April Fools joke, and I originally had three ideas that it could possibly be. There\u2019s no dramatic reason for why this wasn\u2019t done, it just wasn\u2019t. However, I wanted to share the most chaotic of the three ideas (I may use the other two next year, hence why I won\u2019t share them):\n\n \n\nThere\u2019d be a **[Drawing Thread]** open for a limited time, being only five seconds. The winner would be picked via a one-sided die. However, because of the element of April Foolery, I\u2019d be the only comment, and therefore, I\u2019d win thanks to the fair drawing process. (The one-sided die is just a sports ball.)\n\n \n\n*That certainly would not be at all whatsoever controversial!*\n\n \n\nHere\u2019s a haiku that summarizes what I just talked about.\n\n \n\n*Stuff is happening.*\n\n*Whether art, wins, or meta.*\n\n*Huff the laughening.*\n\n(It doesn\u2019t have to make sense, it just needs to rhyme.)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1554847563.0},{"title":"I guess 40 is my lucky number [Winner's Thread #40]","author":"PureGold07","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/b2b3az\/i_guess_40_is_my_lucky_number_winners_thread_40\/","text":"An introduction always seem obligatory to these things, doesn't it? I honestly never expected myself to win period until I got a message from someone congratulating me. I obviously thought he\/she was pulling my leg and wondered why me? Until more notifications kept ringing in of people thanking me and then the beautiful mod of this place messaged me. I still can't believe it amd truthfully I entered these things because it's unbelievable to me to think I would actually win as I tend to be very unlucky in these things. Like, God. But what can I share about me that I'd be comfortable with. I'm a very cautious person \n\nLet's see. I'm a 20 something year old average adult who lives in the good ol'd U.S.A. if anyone give a crap about that. I, just like a lot of people, tend to work all day seemingly wasting away their life, trying to survive day by day. So this is why this money would be helpful as well. What's the purpose of life, I sometimes wonder. Why am I here? Those existential questions ponders my mind, but tbh there isn't much exciting things about my life but I feel the normalcy and boredom is something that I like. Perhaps I should change that? Anyway I am a strongly opinionated person as well whom just can't seem to stay out of arguments, probably explain why I come here to Reddit. When not circlejerking with people of other subs, focusing on things in real life kinda brings me joy I guess. I am an avid fan of technology in the sense that I like to keep updated with it. (Don't come to me for advice) gamer here. (RISE UP!) enjoy listening to hip-hop\/rap music. I also like reading as well, but not traditional reading as reading fanfiction seem to be my go-to. Mangas as well. I enjoy the MEMEZ bruh \n\nI'm sure there are a very controversial things about me as a few people have problems with what I say and that's okay. If this is something that prevents you from donating, then remember that this is all voluntary and I thank anyone who decide to do so, even if it's 1 cent. Hah. \n\nNOW! The true reason why you're here and what do you want to know. WHAT WILL I do with the MONEY?! Truthfully to be told I've been wanting to get my financial situation under control so you guys are safe to know that I will not be spending it on alcohol and drugs. I'm actually planning on saving this money for however much I get, as blowing it all would be irresponsible imo. THAT'S RIGHT. A majority of it will probably go to my savings and maybe indulge a little. I have nothing else to say and if you have questions (yes controversial or not) then ask me. I'm sure some people are curious what kind of person I am. Regardless of what you do, thank you. \n\nEDIT: Hey guys what's up. Just wanted to update you on how much money I have received so far. I thank and appreciate everyone who donated and even those that have not, well maybe next time you can. Obviously I didn't expect much but I'll take everything I can get and really thank you to everybody. \n\nEDIT 2: Hey guys. I am still grateful for everyone whom donated. I really do APPRECIATE IT SO much. The kindness some people showed was amazing. So shout-outs to everyone who was kind enough to do that and to everyone else. Still mind-boggling that I won. One thing I noticed though is that a quite of few people sent me Google Pay through my paypal email and some even sent money to my paypal through Google Pay email. As for everyone else whom sent me money through other means like cashapp and Venmo I'm sorry but I couldn't accept. The ones listed below is where you can send if interested in donating. \n\nEdit 3: Somewhere last month I calculated how much I received and it was like $500 something in total. I did do each individual as it got confusing but appreciate and shoutout to everyone whom donated. Also my paypal acc is now limited so please send anything through paypal to the Google Pay email. \n\nALSO may the next winner hopefully be someone in this thread\n\nPaypal: $295\n\nGoogle Pay: $31\n\nETH: $7.83\n\nBCH: $6.08\n\nLitecoin: $3.15\n\nBTC: $120.16 \n\n\nEverything listed should result in direct lines of payment to \/u\/PureGold07.

When I saw the \u201ccongratulations to \/u\/lolsokje\u201d I let out my biggest \u201cWTF\u201d ever (and in my excitement I forgot to actually reply to the drawing thread, oops), and I'm pretty sure I almost woke up my parents, whom I'm staying at for the weekend. It's still kinda surreal I actually won one of these!\n\nAnyway, some more details about me; I\u2019m a 23-year old Dutchman currently living in Belgium. I started my first ever full time job as a web developer September last year, after finally getting my Bachelor\u2019s degree after 6 years and 2 earlier studies I dropped out off. My main interests are Formula 1, the NBA (currently watching the All Star game while typing this up at 3am), playing guitar and occasionally gaming as well. I also like making websites in my free time, but as that's my job as well it's less of a hobby. \n\nDuring the 6 years to get my degree I racked up quite some student debt (more than is usual here), and I also had to borrow some money from my grandparents, so that\u2019ll be the main target for any money kindly donated! In case anyone wants something in return, we've got a cute as fuck dog I can post pictures of if anyone's interested :D\n\nEdit: [Dog pictures!](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/iq7WA6p)\n\nEverything listed should result in direct lines of payment to \/u\/lolsokje.

However, despite addressing the problem with throwaway accounts, I forgot one thing: organizing the comments by \"old\".

Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00 UTC, then it will, simple. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the Dropbox folder, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Awareness for Fairness:**\n\n*This post will not be edited,* aside from potential ninja edits for formatting. This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #38, remove the first two lines, and upload the file to a SHA-256 generator. The hash you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3 and follow the path to the text file here: *MillionaireMakers Drawing #38\\Drawing\\OfficialMM38IDs.txt*\n\n***\n\n**Mostly Consistent Stream:**\n\nThere will likely be a stream on my Twitch channel: https:\/\/twitch.tv\/nandinmaster\n\nThis stream, while it may start earlier, will happen at 16:00 UTC, which in my time-zone, translates to 11:00 PM ET (hour before high noon).\n\nThis stream will occur on Android via screen recording, and most likely under a cellular service's umbrella.

I am a just your typical redditor, or at least what I assume to be a typical redditor until I am told differently, a white male age 20-35. I mostly type thoughtful responses and retorts that I promptly delete before sending. I am kinda nerdy. I've been to 3 or 4 meetups where I sit awkwardly trying to put screen names to faces.  \n\nNow what you all came here for, the part where I say what I will do with the money. 75% of the money is going towards my student loan debt the other 25% will be donated to the American Cancer Society and to Feeding America. My father lost his battle with lung cancer last Christmas. I like to think that he was looking out for me this Christmas. After he retired he devoted his time to Feeding America. He was proud of how efficiently they collected and distributed food, and the difference he was able to provide the community. I know you don't believe this but I have sent verification to the mods.

By 16:00 UTC (less than an hour as of posting this), the winner will be selected. The Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to pick this winner. This can be verified at any device running Python 3.7, and you do not need to own Bitcoin in order to participate.**\n\n**Additionally, all information to replicate the Drawing at home is available on Dropbox, scroll down for more information.**\n\n**Importantly, this post WILL NOT BE EDITED in order to keep the integrity of the Drawing. To verify this, look for the lack-of a star near the time passed since its creation. The winner will be announced in a stickied comment.**\n\n**If you would like to watch the winner being picked live, head here: https:\/\/twitch.tv\/nandinmaster**\n\n***\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *Some of the information may be unrevised, but procedures are the same as prior draws. Thank you.*\n\n***\n\n**Mailing List Subscribers:**\n\nI want to work on automating this feature with \/u\/anarcist69. Thank you for your patience.\n\n***\n\n**Explain This!**\n\nThe Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain will be used to choose a winner. Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. Like before, this subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three blocks. If it's discovered by 16:00 UTC, then it will, simple. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the Dropbox folder, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**Awareness for Fairness:**\n\n*This post will not be edited,* aside from potential ninja edits for formatting. This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators. To prove this, look for the lack of an asterisk near the time since creation.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #37, remove the first two lines, and upload the file to a SHA-256 generator. The hash you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, download Python 3 and follow the path to the text file here: *MillionaireMakers Drawing #36\\Drawing\\OfficialMM36IDs.txt*\n\n***\n\n**Mostly Consistent Stream:**\n\nThere will likely be a stream on my Twitch channel: https:\/\/twitch.tv\/nandinmaster\n\nThis stream, while it may start earlier, will happen at 16:00 UTC, which in my time-zone, translates to 11:00 PM ET (hour before high noon).\n\nThis stream will occur on Android via screen recording, and most likely under a cellular service's umbrella.

A random user will be chosen, and everyone donates a dollar to make a millionaire. You are welcome to spread this thread via upvoting, telling friends and family, and sharing on social media! [If you'd like to be reminded to enter the next drawing by RemindMeBot, click here!](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttp%3A%2F%2Freddit.com%2Fr%2FMillionaireMakers%2Fabout%2Fsticky%5D+RemindMe!+December+21+2018+11%3A00+PM+%22Enter+the+%2Fr%2FMillionaireMakers+drawing!%22)**\n\n**What is this, anyway?**\n\nThree years ago, a Redditor posted an idea in \/r\/Showerthoughts that speculated the fact, [if a million people picked a certain Redditor and all donated just $1, they would have the power to make someone a millionaire](https:\/\/redd.it\/2mq94c).\n\nThis subreddit is an embodiment of that showerthought, and the monthly drawings are the attempts to make it happen.\n\nWe **need** your help to keep this running, which amounts to only $1 a month to make someone's day. In the long term, that\u2019s $120 every **decade**, which is a much more affordable price than other expenses. How does it work? Below, you will find an explanation on entering, rules to keep in mind, the selection, and other important things to note.\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n* REQUIRED: Leave only **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. It is highly recommended to comment \"`RemindMe! 3 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers`\", which will remind you via PM to donate. \n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only **ONE** top level comment per person *(replies and subsequent-level comments aren't included)*, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment.\n\n* If, by any chance, you do double comment, **delete any extra duplicates ASAP, ideally before the thread is locked in 24 hours, as any chosen draws found to violate this will not be eligible to win, and will be banned from the subreddit.**\n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After 24 hours, this thread will close, and the method of selection will begin.\n* While attempts to make the selection method similar to 2017\u2019s have been performed, it still varies from the original. For an example from a prior drawing, see **[[Draw #33]](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/98ifef\/were_coming_to_a_draw_as_a_millionaires_about_to\/)**. For archival purposes, please [click here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/) for the original selection method.\n* **Method's TL;DR:** Your number is assigned by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1, and the list of comments will be publicly released. The subreddit then waits for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, after a preselected date and time, and calculates the winner using a formula described in the posts mentioned above.\n* Comment IDs are downloaded at ~~2:00 UTC~~ 5:00 UTC, ~~three~~ six hours following the thread being locked. There will be two trial runs prior to ~~2:00 UTC~~ 5:00 UTC, and one trial run thirty minutes after. If it is shown that deletion of comments are occurring between any of the trial runs, or technical difficulties, the retrieval of the comments will be delayed by an hour, following the same procedures.\n* To determine if you are on the list, please go to your comment and save it. The comment ID is what gets recorded and selected, which looks like this: `e3yxpj4`.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for their chosen payment methods (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire! A donation table will be stickied to the winner\u2019s post, giving users the freedom in how they donate.\n* The lucky Redditor follows up with a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal, Square Cash, and Google Wallet account, and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. *(Note: Some services may not be available depending on where you reside.)*\n* To buy any cryptocurrencies, you may use [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* To store cryptocurrencies, there are many accessible wallets, and if you win, you will be guided on which ones to download. For Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, it\u2019s recommended to use the [Electrum](https:\/\/electrum.org\/#home) and [Electron Cash](https:\/\/electroncash.org\/index.html) wallet for Mac, Linux, and PC.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment \"`RemindMe! 3 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers`\".\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a correlation between this subreddit making it in \/r\/all and an increase in donations.\n* Try to cross-post to relevant subs, and upvote. There is a correlation between reaching \/r\/all and the amount of donations for the winner. *(Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here.)*\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, making history, and coming together to make someone's life better. It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple buckeroos, or going through tough times and can only donate a few pennies. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: **This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter.** No prizes are given away directly by the moderators of this subreddit *(the moderators will never even touch your donations; this is done voluntarily)*. As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you good feelings, imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. You can go invite your family to the Thwnksgiving table, take them out, or prepare for the winter season!\n\nOne million dollars can be enough to change someone\u2019s life. Spread the word: have your friends and family comment, post the link to your friendly-neighborhood social media network, and share it to anyone interested.\n\n**LET'S ~~THANK~~ MAKE A MILLIONAIRE!**\n\n*Thanks for your patience.*\n\n*I'm thankful for all of you.*\n\n*Now give your dollar!*","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1542409226.0},{"title":"Apparently, Christmas is on Halloween this year! :) [Winner's Thread #35]","author":"lilikiwi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/9qevob\/apparently_christmas_is_on_halloween_this_year\/","text":"\n\nWhere to start? I think [my first post-realization post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/9q44zr\/_\/e86tnfy) pretty much sums it up. \nI guess it's a tasteful combination of surprised shock - because I'm the unluckiest fool on Earth when it comes to these things, I've never so much as won a sticker in a tombola -, guilt - I used to participate pretty regularly in this sub, but the last couple months I kinda lost track of it. I almost didn't participate actually, as I think the last winner or two probably didn't get the usual couple $ from me (I'll make up for it!), and only really commented because I thought [the rake thing](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/9powr6\/_\/e842g2v) was funny -, and elation - as this couldn't have come at a better time. Winning is the kind of thing that I daydream about, and I love the idea of the community participating in making others' lives easier. This sub and its concept is awesome, and I love being a part of it (even when I don't win)! \n\nI don't usually like to talk much about myself online, but y'all deserve to know a bit about who you're helping out :-) So, I'm 33, I live in Belgium. I'm a biologist, I have a cat, 4 birds, and a husband. My username is actually partially based off the name of one of my pets, Kiwi, a little conure that I helped save when she was a baby birb. Love of my life (sorry, hubby!). Life has been overall good, I know I'm lucky compared to many people, despite things being a bit rough and complicated recently, having a hard time finding work and such. We're not rich, but we have a roof over our heads and food on the table, and we've even been able to splurge a bit for our wedding this summer (well, more the honeymoon than the wedding itself, tbh), thanks to our friends who helped out. I might not have much, but I try to be generous with what I do have, and to be a positive addition to the lives of people I cross. \n\nSo what am I going to do with all these sudden riches? Well there was a nice little luxury villa in the Bahamas I had my eye on... More seriously, a good part will probably go to helping pay some bills that just popped up, like my kitty's recent vet visit, and rent which has just gone up. Then according to what's left, I would love to be able to take my husband out to a nice restaurant or a concert he's been eyeing, because he's a good man and I can't gift him these things as often as I'd like. Then, if it's possible, I'd love to fly over to see my brother, who lives in another country, and get to see my nephew for his birthday. We'll see what's possible :-) either way, I'm so grateful to all of you! \n\nI just want to end with a big shout-out: to the mods, who are really friendly and do a great job a running this sub, and  and u\/lilfruini in particular who so patiently helped work through timezone and technical issues; to the community as a whole, for making this kind of thing possible, and restoring faith in humanity's ability to share and care about others; and of course, last but not least, to all of you, whether you donate or just leave a friendly comment, for bringing a smile to my face today and whenever I'll be raking my leaves :-)\n\nCheers to all of you!! \n\n***PS:*** Haiku! \n\nIt seems I have won  \nAmazing rakes incoming!  \nLeaves on lawn no more.\n\n\n\n***Edit:*** I'm blown away by the generosity.

For future \/r\/MillionaireMakers winners, Steem is converted to their ideal method of payment, and like last time, it is another method of payment to the winner. [You can find us on Steem at @millmakers!](https:\/\/steemit.com\/@millmakers)\n\n* **On December 28th, a week following [Drawing Thread #37], there will be another survey.** Please stay tuned for further information.\n \n**These announcements are to inform everyone of what\u2019s going on at \/r\/MillionaireMakers.** These announcements are made for the purpose of showing as much transparency as possible.

We're bringing a new mailing list in the form of a website, [send.redditmm.com](https:\/\/send.redditmm.com)!**\n\n###### **So... a website?**\nAs of writing this post, this website only directs to the mailing list. Since people have requested for a mailing list since I took over, our hope is that people receive reminders when the front page of Reddit fails them.\n\nIt is also convenient; imagine talking to a friend telling them about the subreddit in casual conversation. Instead of telling them to send a reminder to the RemindMeBot, you can tell them to get reminded by going to [redditmm.com](https:\/\/send.redditmm.com), avoiding all the hassle that comes with logging in to an account.\n\n###### **I don't want to deal with junk mail. How often will I receive emails?**\nFor those worried of inbox clutter, don't worry! The mod team will only send two emails: the reminder to enter the **[Drawing Thread]**, and the **[Winner's Thread]**, to donate the dollar. Additionally, any further announcements will be shared in either (or both) of the **[Drawing Thread]** or **[Winner's Thread]** emails.\n\n###### **What are your plans for the [send.redditmm.com](https:\/\/send.redditmm.com) domain?**\nOf course, it's also a waste to have a website be used just for the sole purpose of sending emails. Hopefully by 2019, the mod team can make it a full-fledged website, mailing list and all. As of now, however, we have no plans to announce at this time.\n\n***\n\nI'd once again, like to thank everyone for their support and patience. I'd also like to add, the mod team is fully expecting the traffic to overwhelm the website. Words can't express it, but I'm serious when I say all of the help I get from users is truly appreciated. My life managing this subreddit has gotten easier because of all the help.\n\n*Edit:* Told by some people the mailing list isn't working. I changed the link, so try again.\n\n**If you are excited to participate, please sign up for the mailing list at [send.redditmm.com](https:\/\/send.redditmm.com)!**\n \n#This Friday at 23:00 UTC, this subreddit will be performing **[Drawing Thread #35]**!\n\n*insert catchy monthly slogan*","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1539954081.0},{"title":"This is so amazing - thank you!

I\u2019m still in a state of complete disbelief that this is even happening right now. I never ever expected to win this! I woke up to a bunch of Reddit notifications and just thought.. \u201cthere\u2019s no way I could\u2019ve won, there\u2019s no way\u201d  \n  \nI don\u2019t think I can express in words just how thankful I am to all the mods and everyone who has helped put this contest together! Thank you to everyone who donates to me. Here\u2019s a little bit about me:  \nI\u2019m an 18 year old girl currently in college. I haven\u2019t been active on Reddit for a long time and a lot of that was just spent lurking. Mostly because I\u2019ve never been a particularly extroverted person (even on social media lol). As I\u2019m sure a lot of you know, college costs a lot of money. Even living at home and with student loans and scholarships it is still going to be a lot. So pretty much any money that gets donated to me will be going towards trying to minimize the amount of debt I\u2019ll have in the future! (Okay and maybe a tiny bit on video games.. the last of us part 2 (probably my most favorite game of all time) is coming out next year and new merchandise is coming out in a few days that I don\u2019t know how I could\u2019ve afforded a couple days ago is now possible).  \nAnyway thank you again to everyone involved! I can\u2019t even describe how much this means to me!  \n  \n  \nUPDATE 1: Hey again! Let me start off by saying the last 24 hours have been some of the craziest of my life! Thank you so much to every single person who donated, who congratulated me, and once again to the mods for all the hard work they did to put all this together! I've been smiling almost constantly for 24 hours now and I don't think i'll be stopping anytime soon. I've gotten some amazing, kind messages on reddit, paypal, and google pay! Thank you for those as well, i've been reading every single one! A few people have asked for totals amounts so far so here are those:  \nPaypal- $  850.41  \nGoogle Pay- $100  \nBitcoin- $52.68  \nBitcoin cash- $395.46  \nLitecoin- $8.35  \nEthereum- $47.05  \n \n  \nSo the grand total (as of 9\/24) is 770.32!!   \n  \nUPDATE 2: Just updated the totals again and the new grand total (as of 9\/25) is $1020.42!!  \n  \nUPDATE 3: (9\/26) new total is 1117.02!!  \n  \nUpdate 4: Just wanted to update the numbers one last time and thank everyone again for all the donations! New total (9\/29) is 1265.59!  \n  \nUpdate 5: I wanted to update again to say thank you to the bitcoin cash association for donating $200! Thank you so much! I've also updated the numbers again and here is the newest total: $1453.95!\n","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1537736896.0},{"title":"It's still September, everyone.

Once the time listed has passed, there will be an active check to determine the blockchain's winning hash. This subreddit will wait for the **3^rd Block** after the time (being 16:00 UTC) to select the winner.\n\nIf a block is discovered by 15:59 UTC, it will not be counted towards the counter of three. If it's discovered by 16:00 UTC, then it will, simple. This can be checked by seeing the timestamp given to it by blockchain explorers.\n\nYou are able to see how this subreddit will verify the winner by checking the Dropbox folder, which also includes a back-up plan in case of an emergency.\n\n***\n\n**For Your Awareness:**\n\n*This post will not be edited,* aside from ninja edits for formatting. This is to prevent tampering of the hash or files by any of the moderators.\n\nTo verify if a hash for a file is that of Draw #34, go to the Comment IDs' text, and select all, excluding the beginning two lines. Afterwards, paste it into a SHA-256 generator. The hash you receive should be the same as what is listed here.\n\nIf you are interested in doing this for yourself, ideally download Python 3, then follow the path to the text file here: *MillionaireMakers Drawing #34\\Outputs\\MillionaireMakers_Comment_IDs_34.txt*\n\n***\n\n**Potential Stream:**\n\nSimilar to last time's drawing, there may be a stream on my Twitch channel: https:\/\/twitch.tv\/nandinmaster\n\nThis stream will happen at 16:00 UTC, which in my time-zone, translates to 12:00 PM ET (noon).\n\nDon't count on it, however. My laptop had its hard drive broken, so if this could be possible, I may need to use screen-streaming software for Android devices.\n\n***\n\n**NOTE:** Before we blow this topsicle land, I'd like to inform anyone that at the time of writing this post, the Dropbox folder is missing its \"Information\" text file. Following the time the drawing has finished, it is my hope to post both that file and the output results from the Selection Code.\n\nDue to the nature of this post, I will not edit this information out.

I don\u2019t comment as much as I used to on reddit, back in the day I spent waaayyy too much time arguing with people on r\/NBA or r\/NFL. Then I had a kid and became one of those creepy lurkers. But the other day my stomach decided to throw hands with Taco Bell, and that gave me a few extra minutes to lurk, which is when I saw r\/MM was back to drawing again. So in the words of Kawhi Leonard, THANK YOU.\n\nIn all seriousness though I have spent the better part of the last day trying to figure out the best way to let you know about me, and what I\u2019ll be doing with anything sent my way. I\u2019m 28 years old. My wife and I have been together since we were 20, and a little under a year ago we had our first child, and it has without a doubt been the most incredible experience I\u2019ve had in my life. He doesn\u2019t like to sleep much, and HATES when you do, and he won\u2019t stop crying until you play Purple Rain for him, but we love him so much that my wife is actually due with #2 here in the next few weeks. Which leads me to what I plan on doing with it. \n\nWe never planned to have any kids, much less two. I actually think it\u2019s because of the milk. We started having milk delivered and she started getting pregnant. Honestly though when you finally get a date night, the grandparents have the kid, and you\u2019re having your first Corona in almost a year, sometimes you forget to take necessary precautions and bam, you\u2019re a few weeks away from having TWO kids under 1. Losing half of your income for what looks like is going to be at least two months after C-section is hard. Fortunately we planned accordingly and saved for it. Unfortunately, life\u2026uhh\u2026..uhh\u2026finds a way to not give a damn lol. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. We\u2019re going to fix her car and try to make it through the birth of our baby girl! And if we get a kitchen table in the process then that wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing!\n\nWith all of that said I want to give thanks to all of you from the bottom of my heart. Thanks to those who are planning to contribute, thanks to those that have in the past, and thanks to those that are running this awesome sub. This doesn\u2019t happen without each and every one of you, and I can personally say that it is impossible to describe just how incredible this is, and there aren\u2019t enough words to show how grateful I am. My wife jokingly (I think) said I should let this sub name our baby, but I said no because \u201cJolly Rancher\u201d isn\u2019t going to look good on any job or college application. The best I can do is pass along something from my mother. I asked her once how she was able to go through rough patches in life with the same happiness that she has during the good times. She said that every night when she goes to bed, she asks herself \u201cIf I were to wake up tomorrow, and only had the things that I was thankful for today, what would I have when I woke up?\u201d. \n\n\n\nI can say without a doubt that when I go through my list of things I\u2019m thankful for tonight, I will be adding each and every one of you. \n\nSincerely,\nAscultone Winner #33\nTL;Dr THANK YOU (Shoutout to Kawhi)\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1: Holy crap! The past 24 hours has been amazing. There are so many incredible people here that have sent donations, kind words, and great advice! The generosity of this entire experience will be something that gets me through for a very very long time. I tried for a long time to keep up with the comments and reply to each individual one but they came so fast I lost the battle lol. So if you haven't gotten a reply from me yet don't worry, I will get there as quick as I can. To all of the people sending such kind messages along with the donations on their respective sites\/app I just want to say thank you. I have read each one so far and have yet to read one that didn't make me smile. So many people were asking for totals and stats so I'll update these as I go:\n\nChaintip:$6.10 \n\nTippr:$224.79\n\nSquare:$63.33\n\nHandcash:$66.63\n\n\nLTC:$19.85\n\n\nGooglePay:$169\n\n\nBitcoin:$686.95 \n\n\nDoge:$4.95\n\n\nVenmo:$2.00\n\n\nThere were a handful of people that asked me to post a Nano address so I'll do that here:\nxrb_1mf9ra95yf7eh8am5my7qh8cbdu49n5aozy6h79suhqobzcr9j9o59eoexcm\n\n\n\nAnd last but not least Paypal: $1033.46.\n\nSo the grand total as of right now is: $2,277.06!! I cannot believe there have been so many people to donate. You guys are so awesome. There were so many who sent extra dollars for taco bell, kids, Corona etc. We had an anonymous bitcoin donation of about $510, and then the bitcoin cash guys sent $200. Both times I thought it was a glitch when I saw it. My wife has been in tears all morning, at one point she texted me \"We're gonna name our girl Baby Mcbabyface and you're gonna have to get over it!\" Obviously she was joking....right?\n\n\n\nAnyway, I'll continue to update as anything comes in. Again, I really can't say how thankful we are enough. Later tonight I'm gonna start getting into the comments I haven't hit yet, so keep your eyes out! And if anyone has baby girl names other than Baby Mcbabyface then I'll pass them along to the head of the naming department lol. \n\n\n\n\nEdit 2:  We decided to take down my pay pal since it had my name in it.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1534781651.0},{"title":"We're coming to a draw, as a millionaire's about to be making!

In the long term, that\u2019s $120 every **decade**, which is a much more affordable price than differing expenses. How does it work? Below, you will find an explanation on entering, rules to keep in mind, the selection, and other important things to note.\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n* REQUIRED: Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. It is highly recommended to comment \"`RemindMe! 3 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers`\", which will remind you via PM to donate. You can also click [this link](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=[http%3A%2F%2Freddit.com%2Fr%2FMillionaireMakers%2Fabout%2Fsticky]+RemindMe!+August+20+2018+23%3A00+UTC+\"Enter+the+%2Fr%2FMillionaireMakers+drawing!\") and *Send* to be reminded to donate.\n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only **ONE** top level comment per person *(replies and subsequent-level comments aren't included)*, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment.\n\n* If, by any chance, you do double comment, **delete any extra duplicates ASAP, as any winning draws found to violate this will not be eligible to win, and will be banned from the subreddit.**\n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After ~~24 hours~~ ~~25 hours~~ **30 hours** *(edit: due to ~~posting~~ technical errors)*, this thread will close, and the method of selection will begin.\n* While attempts to make the selection method similar to 2017\u2019s have been performed, it still varies from the original. For an example from the newest drawing, see **[[Redraw #32]](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/9233ev\/lets_try_again_shall_we_redraw_32\/)**. For archival purposes, please [click here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/) for the original selection method.\n* **Method's TL;DR:** Your number is assigned by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1, and the list of comments will be publicly released. The subreddit then waits for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, after a preselected date and time, and calculates the winner using a formula described in the posts mentioned above.\n* To determine if you are on the list, please go to your comment and save it. The comment ID is what gets recorded and selected, which looks like this: `e3yxpj4`.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for their chosen payment methods (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire! A donation table will be stickied to the winner\u2019s post, giving users the freedom in how they donate.\n* The lucky Redditor follows up with a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal, Square Cash, and Google Wallet account, and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. *(Note: Some services may not be available depending on where you reside.)*\n* To buy any cryptocurrencies, you may use [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* To store cryptocurrencies, there are many accessible wallets, and if you win, you will be guided on which ones to download. For Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, it\u2019s recommended to use the Bitcoin.com wallet for [iOS](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/bitcoin-wallet-by-bitcoin-com\/id1252903728?mt=8) and [Android](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.bitcoin.mwallet&hl=en_US), or the [Electrum](https:\/\/electrum.org\/#home) and [Electron Cash](https:\/\/electroncash.org\/index.html) wallet for Mac, Linux, and PC.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment \"`RemindMe! 3 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers`\".\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a correlation between this subreddit making it in \/r\/all and an increase in donations.\n* Try to cross-post to relevant subs. *(Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here.)*\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, making history, and coming together to make someone's life better. It takes three minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a couple buckeroos, or going through tough times and can only donate a few pennies. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: **This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter.** No prizes are given away directly by the moderators of this subreddit *(the moderators will never even touch your donations; this is done voluntarily)*. As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n\nIf a lone $1 can get you a hamburger, imagine the possibilities with $1,000,000. You can go enjoy yourself by participating in concerts, travel through Europe, or even plan a wedding!\n\nOne million dollars can be enough to change someone\u2019s life. Spread the word: have your friends and family comment, post the link to your friendly-neighborhood social media network, and share it to anyone interested.\n\nSo, you know how this goes: **LET'S MAKE A MILLIONAIRE!**\n\nNow, a haiku for those into literary works:\n\n*Make millionaires,*\n\n*I didn\u2019t plan this ahead...*\n\n*Refrigerator.*\n\n**NOT-SO-NINJA EDIT:** Apparently, I did it an hour too early. Well, let it be known: **22:00 UTC is the new 23:00 UTC!** I will also leave this open for ~~*25 hours*~~, as some people may have scheduled their plan, and may have not anticipated an early post.\n\n**NOT EVEN A NINJA EDIT:** So... plans changed.

Their efforts include [inviting users to **purse.io**, a website that offers Amazon orders in exchange for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash](https:\/\/blog.purse.io\/from-one-to-two-bitcoin-cash-bad5ec8539f4), the [Bitcoin Cash Truck](https:\/\/twitter.com\/BitcoinCashFund\/status\/1014515659403907072) that was in Toronto, Canada, and a [promotional video featuring the narrator of The Stanley Parable](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ciLa56nMf3U).\n \n###### **What are their plans for \/r\/MillionaireMakers?**\nIn exchange for spreading awareness of Bitcoin Cash by adding information on the sidebar and featuring it as a prominent cryptocurrency alongside Bitcoin and Litecoin, the BCF will help advertise subsequent drawings, offer programming work to make running this subreddit a lot smoother, and provide future winners with additional Bitcoin Cash.\n \n###### **How are you benefitting from this partnership?**\nThe partnership allows this subreddit to be capable of doing things that I can\u2019t do alone, including promoting this subreddit beyond its 100,000 subscribers. Also, I can work with other much more informed and talented individuals more closely on enforcing rules and making processes much more automated, thanks to programmers offering their time to make running \/r\/MillionaireMakers smoother. *I am not being funded for promoting the Bitcoin Cash Fund*, be it directly nor indirectly. This collaboration is directly for the benefit of the winners, this subreddit and to spread awareness of Bitcoin Cash.\n \n###### **What does this mean for the winners?**\nThe BCF vows to donate $200 to the winner, and encourages the low fees incentivized by Bitcoin Cash. In addition, their marketing will bring in more people, which correlates to more donors for the winner.\n\n###### **Wait, does this mean that Bitcoin Cash will now replace Bitcoin in choosing a winning hash?**\nBitcoin will continue to be the providing blockchain used for selecting the winning hash, and the address will continue to be listed as another method of sending donations to the winner. However, more information will be provided on Bitcoin Cash, including its tipping bots (\/u\/tippr, \/u\/chaintip, and \/u\/BCHTips).\n \nAs always, the type of donations sent are all determined by the donors. Of course, people are welcome to use tipping bots listed and any others that I have not been made aware of, but other cryptocurrency addresses for donors will continue to be present (at the choice of the winner), such as Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, among more. Additionally, cash transfers will continue to be in use, including Google Wallet, PayPal, and now, Square Cash. The winner is welcome to exclude certain forms of payment themselves in what they accept, should they be chosen.\n \n***\n\nHopefully, this partnership will please people on both sides of the Bitcoin community, and is met with content from the subscribers of \/r\/MillionaireMakers. This collaboration will help make this subreddit bigger than what it already is thanks to the efforts of many people.\n \nThe **Bitcoin Cash Fund** have made a respective post on **[yours.org](https:\/\/yours.org)** detailing what this partnership signifies and their goals.

[Update & Draw #32]","author":"lilfruini","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/8zydyo\/its_been_a_while_so_lets_do_things_a_bit\/","text":"##If you're looking for the winner, please check to see if there's a stickied comment on this post.\n\n***\n\nHello, I'm your newest mod, \/u\/lilfruini, and I thought it's been a while since we did a drawing.\n\n**Will you be doing drawings as they've been done before?** I'm not going to perform the drawing as before, but I have my reasons. First, I'm not able to use Amazon Web Services, which seems to be a prerequisite for using the drawing source code. Second, I am not a good coder at all, this subreddit was my first experience with using Python, which makes yet another obstacle.\n\nTo make up for my shortcomings, though, I want to share the files I used on Dropbox. You can see every comment ID indexed, the SHA-256 hash to confirm I haven't tampered with the list, and I included the Python file used to download the comments, with PRAW.\n\n**How will you select a MakingMillionaire this time?** Well, instead of choosing a date and a time, instead, I'll be pre-selecting a block from the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. The block's hash will be used to determine the winner. I made an effort to have the hash come near the third of each Friday, and to make sure the blocks are a factor of 250, to ensure consistency. However, this means the time held for drawings will vary greatly.\n\nAnyway, which block will we be using?\n\n##BLOCK #539750\n\nWhen the block is mined, you will be able to see the returning hash here: https:\/\/blockchair.com\/bitcoin-cash\/block\/539750\n\n**How will we know you aren't some deceiving scum?** Well, like before, I will still use the SHA-256 of the IDs combined. I also made sure to check if the list of IDs were consistent by checking the SHA-256 of each group of text, to ensure information is constant. You can see this for yourself in the Dropbox folder.\n\nIn addition, **I WILL NOT EDIT THIS POST!** (excluding ninja edits) That means, to check the winner of the drawing, see the future stickied comment. This is to ensure I do not change the SHA-256 hash of any texts.\n\n**This means everything will run smoothly, right?** Well, not exactly. I have the entirety of the comment IDs of the 32nd Thread, but I said before that I'm not a good coder by any means. I will have to figure out how to use *hashlib* or *OpenSSL* in order to hash the numbers and retrieve the winning index. If you're investigative, you may also notice that the folder, \"Files used for Hash\", is incomplete. This is intentional, but once I figure out how to calculate a winning index, I will upload the necessary files to the folder.\n\nOn the subject of that, **if anyone knows how to replicate retrieving the winning index of past drawings through Python or any other means, please PM me.**\n\nAlso, I cannot guarantee this by any means, but I may, *MAY* livestream the release of Block #539750 on my Twitch channel, https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/nandinmaster\/\n\nThis livestream, however, may be done through a phone, as I don't feel prepared to download screen-capturing software on my laptop.\n\n***\n\n**Thank you for your patience!** It's literally been a year since the last post was made, but now I feel prepared, despite some flaws. If you have any questions, or have the need to say something, please comment.\n\nAlso, I'd like to give special credit to \/u\/TyrSniper from \/r\/AskProgrammers for guiding me with using Python.

Hello, \/r\/millionairemakers.\n\nFirst things first: thank you all so much for your kind messages and congratulations! It's been positively overwhelming to read through all your comments and messages. It's making this situation even more unbelievable than it already is.\n\nAs I was trying to keep myself from falling asleep at three in the morning last night, I suddenly received a Reddit message out of nowhere, and slowly it dawned on me that I was the lucky soul who won the 30th drawing. I can barely even begin to attempt to describe how absurdly lucky I feel. Again, from the bottom of my heart: **thank you**!\n\nAs for me: I'm a college student from the Netherlands whose interests mainly consist of music, art, entertainment, and travel - which is something I haven't been able to do as much as I'd like to lately. I'm not going to share some superficial sob story, but winning this drawing means incredibly much to me.\n\nSo what will I be spending the money on? I'd like to spend a few days at most abroad and see some of the amazing sights that Europe has to offer. However, I'll also save up a fair chunk of it so I have less student debt to pay off when I graduate. Chances are I'll also invest some of it into paying for study-related materials - textbooks and other essentials. \n\nAnyway... I'm completely overwhelmed by your kindness and generosity. You are all such compassionate people and you've made me a very, very happy human being. This is an amazing community and I still can't believe my luck. Once again: ***thank you all so, so much. <3***\n\n**EDIT 1**: It's 01:23 AM (GMT+2) here right now, and we've already surpassed 200$ USD!! I can't thank you all enough, I'm speechless! \n\n**EDIT 2**: 12:45 PM (GMT+2), and I just woke up to find out that this incredible community has already donated over $900 USD. This is unbelievable. :') Thank you all for your support! <3 (On a sidenote: I'm currently having some trouble with Google Wallet as I don't live in the US\/UK, so I'd personally prefer PayPal\/BTC-donations right now - I'm working on it, though!)\n\n**EDIT 3**: Almost 24 hours in, and this community has raised over *1500$ USD* already. I'm completely blown away. I appreciate your donations and heartwarming messages and comments so much!\n\n**EDIT 4**: 01:10 PM (GMT+2) (25\/04). This is just bizarre - over 2000$ USD has been raised already. I'm feeling so incredibly fortunate, thank you all so much! <3\n\n**EDIT 5**: 02:33 AM (GMT+2) (27\/04). This is insane - we've gone past 2500$ USD now. I'm stunned at all the support this community has given me. You are incredible.\n\n**EDIT 6** 06:17 PM (GMT+2) (30\/04). Hey everyone! This has been an unbelievable week. Just a quick update: as it turns out, **I can't accept USD on Google Wallet** since I don't live in the US. Your USD will probably be refunded in a week or so. In case you'd still like to donate, I strongly suggest using PayPal instead. Thank you all! <3\n***\n***","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1492983124.0},{"title":"Time to pick who we're making a millionaire, join us.

So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

I was sitting home on a Sunday night watching Girls when some PMs started to come in congratulating me for winning. I could not believe it and thought surely there was some mistake. I feel so lucky right now!\n\nA little bit about me: late 20s gal who put herself through an expensive for-profit college and many years later am still chipping away at the student loan \"rock\" that seems to barely be moving. \n\nChanging jobs in a week so this is fantastic timing as there will most likely be a gap in pay. Hoping I have found somewhere I can double my current salary within the next 6-9 months so I am feeling very excited about the change. \n\nI love going to concerts and wrestling shows and plan on using some of the winnings for fun and not just bills. Thinking of grabbing Summerslam tickets for August as I went last year and had a blast but was not thinking I could afford it this year. I also have 2 cats that I plan to get special treats\/toys for too. \n\nI just wanted to thank everyone who has already reached out to me to congratulate me. It feels like a dream and I love waking up to my envelope colored orange!\n\n**EDIT 1**: 3-20 9:45PM EST - Paypal: $474.68 - GW: $103.23- BTC: $83.18 - Doge: $2.30 = $663.39! I can't believe all the support, well wishes, and donations. I am so grateful to everyone for making this sub work!! Kitty pics to follow :)\n\n**EDIT 2**: kitty pics! Just what I had on my phone I will get better ones in the next few days when I get them some toys! Tiger is Lily and grey fellow is Pogo \n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/qeIeoFS\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/mrHSi9m\n\n**EDIT 3**: I was going to wait to update again on Friday but I'm just blown away by the kindness and generosity so I wanted to come on and update the new totals after about 29 hours. \n\nPaypal: $748.99 - GW: $23.77- BTC: $72.45 - Doge: $3.75 Lite: $1.52 = $850.48 for the day and a grand total over all of $1513.87!! Thank you to everyone who donated to me and I will have updates over the next couple of weeks because I know everyone is interested to know the numbers! More kitty pictures to come as well!!\n\n**EDIT 4**: 3-24 11:45PM EST - As promised I wanted to give a quick end-of-week update! Grand total so far is **$1843.51** (roughly since the price of cryptocurrency has been all over the place this week). I just want to thank everyone again for all the well wishes and donations. I am a bit busy this weekend setting up my office for my first day of work Monday but I will try and come back with kitty pictures before the weekend is up. Donations seem to be slowing down a bit, so I will update again next Friday unless anything major happens. THANK YOU!!!\n\n**EDIT 5**: 4-3 just wanted to hop on and give you an updated total. I am now up to **$2099.27** total. Things have slowed down a it since the first week but I am still getting multiple messages everyday and really appreciate everything! I have paid bills including throwing a little extra on my highest interest student loan and made a donation towards the Congenital Heart Walk I am doing for a friend's baby in May. Also got the furry kids some items as well. Included pictures below of pogo in his new \"watermelon\" bed and kitty condo - lily didn't want to corporate for picture time  :) \n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/nvlWvhx\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/xcaouPa\n\n**EDIT 6**: 4-7 updated total thus far is **$2117** - Have a great weekend everyone!!!\n\n**Final Edit** 4-25 hello all wanted to give you the most final total I think I will have it looks like I ended up at **$2213.88**. I appreciate everyone's kindness and donations and I can't say enough how amazing this community is and how encouraged I feel. I wish I had something more glamorous to show you guys that I got with the winnings but really I just got caught up on bills which is an amazing feeling and came at a great time because I have found out I need to move in the next two months so being caught up is so helpful. If anything major happens I'll come back and update otherwise, once again, **THANK YOU**\n \n***\n***\n \nThis part is written by the mods:\n \nAll of the amounts below should result in \/u\/kep700 receiving about $1 USD\n \n**Methods of payment:**\n \n**Tipbots**\n \n | Guide | Amount | Comment this to donate\n---|---|---|---\n**Dogetip** | [Guide](\/r\/dogetipbot\/w\/gettingstarted) | 5000 Doge | \"+\/u\/dogetipbot 5000 doge\"\n**Litetip** | [Guide](\/r\/litetip\/about\/sidebar) |$1 | \"+\/u\/litetip $1\"\n \n**Cryptocurrency transfer**\n \n | Guide | Amount | Address | QR Code\n---|---|---|---|---\n**Bitcoin** | [Guide](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/getting-started)| 0.001 BTC | *3JpADVAWVbpg9tFtGAmk1foUbjL8Eszb3j* | *http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/XRC4x*\n**Dogecoin** | [Guide](http:\/\/dogecoin.so\/send-dogecoin\/) | 5000 Doge | *AAqiWidAJpQ1QuKLpBLDS2GVMbZxbfDjHw* | *http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/xdP95*\n**Litecoin** | [Guide](https:\/\/litecoin.info\/Litecoin) | 0.38 LTC | *33txQQb9fPtzytpgwgNUPigXjEGPFG7QEU* | *http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/WkVUe*\n \n**Cash transfer**\n \n | Guide | Amount | Address\n---|---|---|---\n**PayPal** | [Guide](https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/webapps\/mpp\/account-setup) | $1.40 | *mm29winner@gmail.com*\n**Google Wallet** | [Guide](http:\/\/www.google.com\/wallet\/faq.html) | $1 | *mm29winner@gmail.com*","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1490035776.0},{"title":"Join us to see who we're making a millionaire!

Don\u2019t have such strong opinions on things you don\u2019t know much about.\n\nI triple dog dare someone to go into my profile overview and find one instance of me being actually racist, by the word\u2019s actual definition. In other words, find me actually bigoted, biased, and discriminatory towards any ethnicity. I promise I haven\u2019t deleted anything besides a few cringe posts that showed my face or were from my high school blunder years. Get back to me on that if you do. \n\nOn the topic of my profile, I would also like to point out that some of you made me chuckle when you think this account is actually a porn alt account. That\u2019s really funny. You bunch are some real talented sleuths. Yes, I use reddit to find porn, almost exclusively. If you check, it is apparent that I\u2019ve commented on a litany of nsfw subreddits. But the thing a lot of you people who think I\u2019m a porn fanatic failed to also see (or ignored) was that I\u2019ve also commented on various video game, computer, skincare, media, and r\/all subreddits. For the past four years no less. Who uses a porn alt for all that? Quit nit picking to find the bits that you find convenient to use as evidence, because people with actual sense will look at the whole picture. Stop trying to comb through my profile to find substance that you can twist to make me look bad, because that\u2019s plain pathetic and petty.\n\nAs for the claims that I\u2019m undeserving, an asshole, or an idiot, I\u2019ll just say that people are entitled to their own opinions. It\u2019s just that if you form that opinion based off one edgy comment without actually explaining why, it\u2019d be wise to maybe not have such strong opinions on things you know nothing about, as I\u2019ve stated earlier. Ironically enough, some of you people are withholding on your gentlemen\u2019s agreement to pitch in when you\u2019ve clearly stated you would in your entry comment. That\u2019s more than enough information for people to form well based opinions off of. Just saying.\n\nFor insight into who I am, I\u2019ll make it short. I am 18, heading into college, enjoy memes, enjoy video games like Red Dead Redemption. I\u2019ve loved poetry since my ap lit class in senior year, god bless you Mrs.Lim(Traveling through the Dark is one of my faves, look it up if ya want). Portrait photography is great, and I love drawn art. My instagram feed is basically artists who use photoshop and draw sketches. In high school I spent time as part of a youth group that hosted youth led festivals for the community. I hope to major in computer science or engineering. I\u2019m including this in case some of you forgot I\u2019m an actual person, and not the embodiment of an edgy comment lol\n\nI also want to thank everyone who supported me since the controversy sparked, you da real mvps\n\n I know much of the community will not donate because of this ordeal because somehow that would support racism(??? As if the rules, spirit, and idea of this sub didn\u2019t matter, and any money donated will go directly to kkk rally funding lol) but regardless, I still hope you all a very, very, merry christmas.\n\nCheers, with a little salt and love, iamchangalang*\n\n\n**EDIT: As of 2pm EST, donations have reached:**\n\n$617.28\n\n\nThis is already more than I could ever ask, I'll be tallying up the totals every few hours to keep you guys updated though!!!

We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin, ~~we recommend using [Changetip](http:\/\/changetip.com) to purchase bitcoin with your credit card.~~ **(Changetip is now closing).**  You can also use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account. **Note:** Changetip is closing in a few months. You can still donate via Changetip for this drawing, and will have a few months to withdraw your funds.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or check out our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word!

Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

They are asking everyone to start emptying their accounts. You may transfer your Bitcoin balances to a traditional Bitcoin wallet or donate your balance to charity as you go through the closeout process.\n\nI know many folks in here learned about Bitcoin through ChangeTip and many of us have accounts with balances. This is especially true for past winners who never merged their ChangeTip winnings into their traditional Bitcoin wallet.\n\nTo do that, log into ChangeTip with your Reddit account, click the Withdraw menu up top and choose Bitcoin. Scroll down to the second section (Withdraw). Copy and paste your standard Bitcoin receiving address into the Wallet Address field, click Select All Funds, and click Send. If you don't know your current receiving address, keep the withdraw page up in another tab and keep reading below.\n\nPrevious winners will already know their Wallet Address -- it's the one where they asked us to send our donations. For anyone else who is not familiar with setting up a traditional Bitcoin wallet, there are several ways to achieve that.\n\nYou may install apps such as Bread Wallet on iOS, Mycelium on Android or Coinbase or Circle. Once you are able to display a \"receive address\", copy the address into the clipboard and send it to yourself so that you may copy and paste it into the Wallet Address field on the ChangeTip Withdrawal page. Don't worry, it is perfectly safe to send your Receive address in the clear. You could even print it on a highway billboard and it would not matter from a security perspective.\n\nIf this is your first time setting up a traditional wallet, make SURE that you follow the steps to protect your access to your funds once you finish setting it up. This typically involves writing down 12 words. If anything happens to your device rendering it gone or unable to boot, the only way to regain control of your funds on a replacement device is by installing the same app and entering the 12 words you will write down as part of the backup procedure.\n\nIf you have very little BTC left in ChangeTip and just want to stick it somewhere without installing and setting up a wallet, go to bitaddress.org. Wiggle your mouse until the percentage counts to 100 and the screen updates. Once you see your Share and Secret addresses, take a screenshot and save the image somewhere, just don't store it in the cloud. Copy and paste the \"Share\" address into the Wallet Address field on the ChangeTip Withdrawal page and click Send.\n\n**Note**: this last method is not to be considered safe for balances more than a few dollars, but it is just fine for this situation, especially if you're not willing or able to set up a real mobile wallet at this time. If you go this route, don't empty your ChangeTip balance into this address before this month's drawing, though, because you will need to setup a real wallet to send any Bitcoin you park in this address, including what you'll send to the winner.\n\nPlease know there are many of us out here who are perfectly comfortable with using traditional Bitcoin wallets, and I'm sure you will find us more than happy to help.\n\ntl;dr install a regular wallet like Bread Wallet on iOS or Mycelium on Android, send your Receive address to yourself and initiate a withdrawal on ChangeTip to that address. Once the Bitcoin arrives, shut down your account to properly close it out.\n\n**Final note:** Do not EVER, EVER try to type in your Receive address at any time. It is very easy to mess it up, and if you're off by one letter or number you could easily send your balance to an address that no one controls (i.e. your money is gone, forever). Always pull up your receive address your mobile app and copy and paste it somewhere so that you can pick it up on the PC or laptop where you're executing the ChangeTip withdrawal.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1479496526.0},{"title":"What's the most anyone's actually gotten from this thread?","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/5a8fi5\/whats_the_most_anyones_actually_gotten_from_this\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1477863123.0},{"title":"I'm curious why this is not considered a charity.

[Donate here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/5eidps\/im_so_sorry_you_all_couldnt_find_me_i_blame_the\/)**\n\nA WEEK FROM MY BIRTHDAY!!! I'm astounded by the generosity of this community and happy to be a part of it. This is one of those things reddit does (really credit goes to the creator\/mods for organizing all this so amazingly) that absolutely warms the cockles of my heart. As soon as I stop shaking I'll try to get some thoughts down here. This is completely unreal.\n\nI'm an unemployed electrical engineer who recently moved back home with his folks, my unexpected unemployment sort of put the brakes on my life. Dream job out of the picture I am just now embarking on the path to create a company. This money will help me wade through the path I've chosen, and goes a long way to ease the worries of unemployment (re:health insurance)! I can not be more thankful for all the help.\n\nThis is just incredible, thank you you generous generous bastards.\n\n**First Edit:** I got a late start but I think I've set up the tip bots properly now? Litecoin won't return my PMS ;_; I'll have that sorted soon. In the meantime you guys are amazing, $98 (ish) bucks! I'll update in a few hours. \n\n**Edit 2:** Total is at: $217.50!!! I have to throw a special thanks out to \/u\/the_real_octojay (his BTC: 19v9SLayJtFvLgVvRwcZNhRtisNetXNcUa) who has been helping me out with this crypto currency stuff. We can't seem to figure out what is going on with the dogecoin tips. Either way he has ushered me into this crazy world of crazy internet crazy money. I feel like party cat every time I check reddit, you guys are the best. \n\n**Edit 3:** 5pm: $300.33!!\n\n**Edit 4:** 8pm: $454.04! \n\nWatching this arrive has made this day incredible, I have to get to sleep soon (as I was up till about 4:30am last night in a complete tizzy). I'll update again tomorrow AM. THANK YOU thank you thank you thank you.\n\n**Edit 5:** 7am: 814.21!!\n\nI'd say this is the best thing I've done first thing Monday in recent memory. \n\n**Edit VI:** 11am:  $979.30!! \n\nLooks like dogecoin is working! So excite, much doge. Also Paypal was at 666.41, sppppooooky!\n\n**Edit G:** 4pm: $1082.32! \n\nMore updates to come as donations from you awesome crazy people slowly trickle in. \n\n**Edit 8:** 7pm: 1109.88**!** \n\nYou all deserve special adult hugs, or whatever your comfort level is. I don't judge.\n\n**Edit 9:** 8am: 1174.71!!  \n\nPaypal limited account because some donations were for exchange of services. When both $20,000 is received and 200 \"exchange for goods\/services\" transactions occur Paypal needs to fill out tax information. WELL before this limit is reached Paypal will make you enter one of three tax IDs (ss EIN and, I think business tax number?). I've punched my info in and the account is unlocked. I had given them my info over the phone, but they didn't pu it in (I think it was just included as a note on the account). I just wanted to type all that out so future winners can see it and clear up any confusion! \n\n**Edit 1e+1 :** 4pm: 1234.64! \n\nSo close to 1234.56. Some change tip stuff still has to register in the comments so its just a touch over that. I've edited down some of the early updates to save on text, make it easier to read. Trust me when I say they are full of excitement! \n\nI've thought about this a lot over the past couple days, and I think I really want a physical thing to comemorate this. Something I can look at and say \"the internet bought me X in 2016\". A pile of cocaine is a transient thing after all. \n\nWith all the light milling\/drilling work I do I've decided to go with a Grizzly mill\/drill: http:\/\/www.grizzly.com\/products\/Mill-Drill\/G0463?utm_campaign=zPage  My lab is cleaner than a metal shop, so buying new will help me keep it that way. I should be able to leave a tool like that to future generations. Can't afford a plaque, but I have a few reddit stickers kicking around. More updates to come, all those that are donating late I'm really happy you remembered and it means a ton to me. THANK YOU MILLINOARE MAKERS!\n\n**Edit 11:** 4pm: 1301.60!! [:D](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/h4UafNG.gif) Changetip caught up finally.\n\n**3d17 12:** 1pm: 1334.45!! \n\nGuess I'm leea...t? The tap has just about stopped so it may be awhile before another update. I changed the model of mill\/drill after some advice from a good friend. still has space for a sticker or two :D\n\n**Edit 13:** 1:30p (10\/29): 1447.70 \n\nSpooky! Happy Halloween party night!\n\n**Edit 14:** Bday time it's the 3rd, 3:33PM. I'm 33 **Total: 1472.92**\n\ngoogle changed the way wallet is displayed so I have to add everything by hand.

The past couple months have been a bit of a roller coaster since life decided to pull a wild card on me. It's so hard to put in to words to explain exactly what I'm feeling today, being on this insane level of happiness, but I am so thankful for the people that started these drawings and also all of you. I can't wait to donate to the next winner!!\n\n\n**Update:** It's 8:30PM CST and I will never forget this day. I really want to hug every single person involved with this. You are all seriously wonderful people. I am at around $1,100 and at a loss for words. This is the best group, and you are changing lives. I want you all to know that - every single one of you is helping to change someone's life. I'm going to get some rest for the night, the last 24 hours have been a whirlwind of emotions!! Good night to everyone, and I will update you all again tomorrow! Tons of hugs all around :)\n\n\n**Update:** At 5PM CST all of your donations total $1929.23!! You are all *seriously amazing*. I want to say thank you over and over again. This is one very, very special group of people :) There are no words for what I've been feeling the past 48 hours, but I know that it won't go away any time soon! :) You have helped me get my life back!!\n\n**Update:** $2268.91!!! <3\n\n**Update:** I just hit a little over $2400, I'm trying so hard to not be annoying, but I just can't help it, thank you thank you thank you thank you. I want to try my hardest to reply to each of you, and it will take some time, but I am definitely going to try :) <3\n\n***\n***\n\nThis part is written by the mods:\n\nAll of the amounts below should result in \/u\/freepieces receiving about $1 USD\n\n**Methods of payment:**\n\n**Tipbots**\n\n | Guide | Amount | Comment this to donate\n---|---|---|---\n**Changetip** | [Guide](\/r\/changetip\/wiki) | $1 | \"Congrats here is $1! \/u\/changetip\"\n**Dogetip** | [Guide](\/r\/dogetipbot\/w\/gettingstarted) | 5000 Doge | \"+\/u\/dogetipbot 5000 doge\"\n**Litetip** | [Guide](\/r\/litetip\/about\/sidebar) |$1 | \"+\/u\/litetip $1\"\n\n**Cryptocurrency transfer**\n\n | Guide | Amount | Address | QR Code\n---|---|---|---|---\n**Bitcoin** | [Guide](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/getting-started)| 0.0017 BTC | 3KczFWvm6vuzMKg9tRYWgeSe8LGjo7AvFr | http:\/\/imgur.com\/TEhYivY\n**Dogecoin** | [Guide](http:\/\/dogecoin.so\/send-dogecoin\/) | 5000 Doge | 9yFMc3a5wZow1uEA8JrdgL3TK8FHxEjVuu | http:\/\/imgur.com\/Flsi2sf\n**Litecoin** | [Guide](https:\/\/litecoin.info\/Litecoin) | 0.3 LTC | 3EALxtP2t7HaKuzkddV9KnC47zYGp6wjRg | http:\/\/imgur.com\/aRfFcfJ\n\n**Cash transfer**\n\n | Guide | Amount | Address\n---|---|---|---\n**PayPal** | [Guide](https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/webapps\/mpp\/account-setup) | $1.40 | greenstripes2016@gmail.com\n**Google Wallet** | [Guide](http:\/\/www.google.com\/wallet\/faq.html) | $1 | greenstripes2016@gmail.com","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1474293558.0},{"title":"Join us in the MillionaireMaker's lounge to select the 23rd winner!","author":"NightVisionHawk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/53ei91\/join_us_in_the_millionairemakers_lounge_to_select\/","text":"**Edit: That was a quick draw!

It would also be an easy and convenient way to organize large amounts of information in an easy to consume fashion.\n\nThe website could also appeal to a large user base of non redditors. It still amazes me that there are a very large number of gamers\/techies that don't access Reddit because of whatever stigma that they may associate with it. \n\n* Social media influencers\n\nWhether it is Instagram, Twitter, or Youtube, a case could be made for the effectiveness of reaching a specific target audience through these. If you were to be featured by a \"Success coach\" or one of the many \"make you rich\" channels, their audience would immediately take an instant interest. People all over the world are looking for a way to become a millionaire, and hopefully some of those would be willing to participate in both sides to this project (entering\/donating).\n\n* Media coverage\n\nAnother method to increasing the subscriber count would be to be featured by a large blog or media outlet, like TechCrunch or something similar. This is not as difficult as one would think. Someone would need to gather all the pertinent information and make a story out of it. If it is well written, and packaged properly, all one is required to do is put it out as a Press Release on something like PRNewswire (http:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/). For those of you unfamiliar with what this is, its a database of press releases that media houses access to find stories. The more direct approach would be to get hold of a author\/editors email\/twitter handle and cold contact them.\n\nPlease note: if you do decide to cold email\/contact authors\/editors, remember to be courteous. You want them to do something for you, there is no need to be rude or demanding. Be considerate of their time, and present everything in a very clear and concise way. They typically lose interest if they need to do more work than they should when looking into potential stories.\n\nI'm reaching the character limit on this post. And depending on the success of this post (engagement\/discussion). I'll hold off and post the 2nd (How to increase donators) in a few days.\n\nMod's, if i am overstepping any boundaries, feel free to remove this post.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1471317785.0},{"title":"This is a dream come true to be given this opportunity by the MM community.","author":"whenthedayforms","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/4tcwd3\/this_is_a_dream_come_true_to_be_given_this\/","text":"Hi everyone this comes to me as such an incredible surprise I'm ecstatic beyond belief. I'm 27 years old and I live in Washington state and work as a caregiver for a residential services company. This couldn't have been bestowed upon me at a better time as I'm planning a trip with my girlfriend of 3 years this coming august! I'm very grateful and happy about this help that I'll be receiving from this great community. \n\nI want to say that I promise first and foremost that I'll return the kindness from all of you to the next winner of \/r\/millionairemakers and to use these donations in a progressing means to better the well being of my family and myself, thank you so much to everyone I really appreciate.\n\nUpdate: Thank you for all your pleasant comments and messages I greatly appreciate it. I understand that my account may look like an alternate which I agree I would question as well, but I would be more than willing to verify this username.\n\nUpdate #2: Good morning everyone, I wanted to update the status of the earnings up to this moment and the total is $491.60!\n\nI apologize for slacking on replying to everyone on here, my galaxy s4 runs out of battery pretty quick unfortunately. My girlfriend and I are in still such disbelief that this amazing thing has happened for us as I sincerely want to say thank you for this. \n\nPart of our trip is actually this coming Friday which we will be road tripping to Seattle for their Capitol Hill block party which is a three day festival where we finally get to experience our two favorite artists perform live for our first time which are Crystal Castles &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Washed Out! \n\nWhile being there I will be able to take my girlfriend to the Seattle zoo where she's been wanting to go for some time being that she's never been able to experience visiting one, so with this opportunity given to me by you I'm ultimately grateful for this.\n\nUpdate #3: Let me weigh in on some of this conspiracy chatter. Since the third drawing of this contest I've had an aspiration of winning this drawing just like most of us in this subreddit, so I made sure to follow the rules and requirements every time I entered. \n\nBriefly looking at some of the other users accounts before they won this drawing and it doesn't look much different than mine and with other redditors commenting and messaging that they would be in the same boat as myself in regards to activity makes most of these complaints unnecessary. \n\nSo to be assumed that I cheated or was in kahoots with the mods by entering multiple times with throwaways makes me that much happier and astonished knowing that I entered with my main account and won against 17,000 other users. Also as lame as this may sound I take pride on how original and creative my user handle is, especially with receiving a message from a redditor complimenting my username is very uplifting\n\nSo with that said my upvotes are finally public so we can all judge accordingly for ourselves.\n\nUpdate #4: Our total after one day is $722.09! I can't believe what I've experienced today in any way, thank you so much for this.\n\nUpdate #5: Hey everyone we're at $876.65 as of almost three days now. I can't fathom any of this still. Thank you to everyone who has helped me I'm extremely grateful for this opportunity. \n\nUpdate #6: Hello everyone sorry for the lack of updates, our total is at $987.35! Thank you to everyone who made this weekend trip possible for us we're beyond grateful. \n\nUpdate #7: we're at $1,071 as of today thank you to everyone who has helped me it means everything!

A random user will be chosen, and everyone donates a dollar to make a millionaire. Don't forget to upvote this thread, subscribe to our twitter, and join our mailing list!**\n\n**What is this, anyway?**\n \nA year ago, a redditor posted an idea in \/r\/Showerthoughts that speculated the fact that [If a million of us picked a certain redditor and all donated just $1, we would have the power to make someone a millionaire](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Showerthoughts\/comments\/2mq94c\/if_a_million_of_us_picked_a_certain_redditor_and\/).\n \nWe are now an embodiment of that showerthought, and this is our next attempt to make it happen.\n\n We **need** your help to keep this running, which only amounts to a $1 a month to make someone's day. Now how does it work? Look below.\n \n**How to enter:**\n \n* REQUIRED: Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. You can also follow [this link](http:\/\/bit.ly\/1WHjpVR) and click send to be reminded to donate.\n \n**Important Rules:**\n \n* Only ONE top level *(not a reply)* comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP.\n \n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n \n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n \n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin, we recommend using [Changetip](http:\/\/changetip.com) to purchase bitcoin with your credit card. You can also use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or check out our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between where we made it it in \/r\/all and donations.\n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n \nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

This could then be entered into some secure database that could cross check the names\/numbers. Have it be voluntary at first, then require new subbers (if possible) to do it, and slowly work on verifying each user that has yet to do so.\n\nIt was stated in a recent posts comment that some people don't like donating to those who you either cannot tell if it is a main or those who are clearly alts, using this system wouldn't be perfect, but it would probably cut down on the chances of an alt winning. That and payment could be refused and the name redrawn if the info for the account doesn't match up with the name of the owner of the pay-to account(s).\n\nEdit: To all the responses with a concern for privacy, the suggestion was to submit it privately to the verifying mods, and to upload it to a secure database. And a quick intro to the internet: If someone has your name and address, they can get your SSN if they know what they are doing. You can literally buy thousands of SSNs and credit card numbers for relatively cheap and the chances that yours is out there is over 90%. Kevin Mitnick (one of the most notorious hackers before getting caught) now does conventions on security, and at every one he brings up a random person, asks their name and gets their SSN in seconds. So your name, a photo and the last four of your social to a single person is less of a risk than having a mailbox outside your house or your name in a public directory.","upvote_ratio":0.3,"created_utc":1462594860.0},{"title":"Hey, millionairemakers!

A random user will be chosen, and everyone donates a dollar to make a millionaire. Don't forget to upvote this thread, subscribe to our twitter, and join our mailing list!**\n\n**What is this, anyway?**\n \nA year ago, a redditor posted an idea in \/r\/Showerthoughts that speculated the fact that [If a million of us picked a certain redditor and all donated just $1, we would have the power to make someone a millionaire](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Showerthoughts\/comments\/2mq94c\/if_a_million_of_us_picked_a_certain_redditor_and\/).\n \nWe are now an embodiment of that showerthought, and this is our next attempt to make it happen.\n\n We **need** your help to keep this running, which only amounts to a $1 a month to make someone's day. Now how does it work? Look below.\n \n**How to enter:**\n \n* REQUIRED: Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. You can also follow [this link](http:\/\/bit.ly\/1YyrGbG) and click send to be reminded to donate.\n \n**Important Rules:**\n \n* Only ONE top level *(not a reply)* comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP.\n \n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n \n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n \n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin, we recommend using [Changetip](http:\/\/changetip.com) to purchase bitcoin with your credit card. You can also use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or check out our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between where we made it it in \/r\/all and donations.\n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n \nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life. Help us to the front page, so we can make history, and...\n \n**LET'S MAKE A MILLIONAIRE!**","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1460760795.0},{"title":"Based off last drawing, there was 13k people.

Here is a brief first update. I hope making a new post like this is okay as I expect noone would see an edit made in the original, but if this is a faux pas let me know and I'll change\/delete\/burn it with fire.\n\nWhat is looking to be more or less the final tally as donations have just about stopped now is ~$1960. I've tried and I think succeeded in thanking everyone who left a comment but if I overlooked you by mistake or you donated without commenting, **THANK YOU!**\n\nAs to my plans: rent has been paid, noodles have been bought, domain names are secured, research has been done, some content has been written. The first website should be going up in approximately a week I would guess and the next not much longer after. A bit slower than hoped as I've gotten a bit ill, probably helped along by the recent excitement and lack of sleep (your fault you heartless monsters! \/s). Once it's up and has Whois guard, and if I'm allowed to shamelessly plug it here, I'd be very happy to post a link if there is interest. But I don't want to spam the community if it isn't wanted. So I guess if there is enough interest I'd be happy to make a few detailed updates as things advance, if not I'll make one more once things have evolved a bit further for those who are interested.\n\nSome minor stats about donations: \n\n* Paypal was by far the most popular method, followed by changetip. \n* Dogetip and Litecoin were unsurprisingly used least often - $11 between the two. \n* Approximately $80 of payments did not go through in changetip due to \"pocket error\". I'm not entirely sure how it works to be honest, but these were due to the amount charged being a few cents higher than what was intended to be sent and presumably then more than was available. For instance changetipping $1 comes up as charging $1.01 sometimes. As u\/-solus- figured out: \"Apparently you send currency based on pockets and each pocket has a different currency. When you tip it automatically sends whatever's in the front pocket. The website automatically sets bitcoin as the front pocket, so while I'm trying to send us dollars, it keeps trying to pull from the bitcoin pocket which is empty. All I had to do was change the front pocket to us dollars. Problem solved.\" Might be worth making a note of this for future drawings.\n\n\nHappy Easter\/Weekend everyone!","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1459021614.0},{"title":"MM you are amazing and helping a complete stranger get back on their feet again today!","author":"Sannyn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/4b8i32\/mm_you_are_amazing_and_helping_a_complete\/","text":"Holy crap, this is something that happens to other people, not to me...

Now how does it work? Look below.\n \n**How to enter:**\n \n* REQUIRED: Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. You can also follow [this link](http:\/\/bit.ly\/1RcJ17u) and click send to be reminded to donate.\n \n**Important Rules:**\n \n* Only ONE top level *(not a reply)* comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments.

This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n \n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n \n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin, we recommend using [Changetip](http:\/\/changetip.com) to purchase bitcoin with your credit card. You can also use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or check out our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between where we made it it in \/r\/all and donations.\n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n \nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

And while it's not a million (nor would I ever dream of that), I would like to again thank everyone for their overwhelming generosity. \n\nMy thanks alone can never be enough, but I hope it will do for now. I don't even know what to do for everyone, other than promise that this money will NOT go to waste. \n\nI LOVE you all!\n\n\n**EDIT #9**: Does anyone know why I keep seeing a large number of \"POCKET ERROR\" on ChangeTip?

I've ensured to thank each and every one of you individually up to this point. Car is going into the shop to get checked out on Saturday to determine if it's worth repairing, or should I look for something else. At least now, I have  that option, thanks to all of you!\n\n**EDIT #11: Final (but depressing) Update**\nI was hoping to come to you all with some very exciting news, that would be seen as an amazing contribution by this community and all of you. Unfortunately, that's not the case.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, I took the money that I had won, and went on the hunt for a car. I found one, and bought it after checking it out, and making sure that everything was operational. It was a 2004 Ford Focus wagon. The body was in really great shape, and the engine was solid. I took it to get an oil change, and have the mechanics give it a once over, and they said everything looked good.\n\nSo I registered the car in my name, had a new fan belt put on, and was good t go, so I thought.\n\nThis past week, on Wednesday, I was running errands at lunch, and the engine started to choke and vibrate quite badly. Engine light came on, and it nearly stalled out at intersections. I immediately took it to the auto shop, and had them check it out. I thought at first that maybe there was a bad spark plug, or something. \nTurned out to be much worse. Looks like the head gasket on the engine ruptured, and one of the cylinders has lost all pressure. Early estimates are over $1000 to fix, which I can't afford, nor do I want to, as I think I was scammed by the seller.\n\nSo I come to you with great sadness and embarrassment. What was to be dubbed \"The MillionaireMakers Reddit car\", has turned into a nightmare. So I'm out the money, out the car, and back to square one. All used car purchases are \"as is\" and there is nothing like a lemon law where I live. So I don't even have any recourse with the seller.\n\nThis isn't a plea for help or a request for anything. I just wanted to share with you, the outcome of draw #16. \nI'm very sorry to everyone. I tried to make things better from your generosity. Turns out, I can't even do that right.\n","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1456100624.0},{"title":"The 16th Drawing is right this way!

Don't forget to upvote this thread!**\n\n**What is this, anyway?**\n \nA year ago, a redditor posted an idea in \/r\/Showerthoughts that speculated the fact that [If a million of us picked a certain redditor and all donated just $1, we would have the power to make someone a millionaire](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Showerthoughts\/comments\/2mq94c\/if_a_million_of_us_picked_a_certain_redditor_and\/).\n \nWe are now an embodiment of that showerthought, and this is our next attempt to make it happen.\n\n We **need** your help to keep this running, which only amounts to a $1 a month to make someone's day. Now how does it work? Look below.\n \n**How to enter:**\n \n* REQUIRED: Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate.

Delete any extra duplicates ASAP.\n \n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n \n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n \n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin, we recommend using [Changetip](http:\/\/changetip.com) to purchase bitcoin with your credit card. You can also use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or check out our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word!

Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

There are a bunch of discussions either explicitly or implicitly about the profitability of the lottery. I tried doing [a rigorous analysis of the odds](http:\/\/gametheory101.com\/is-the-powerball-lottery-profitable\/), and the margins came out surprisingly close.\n\nTo summarize, based on the increase in lump-sum prize, lottery officials are expecting to sell ~413 million tickets for the upcoming draw. If you were to buy a ticket with every combination, the binomial distribution using 413 million and 1\/292 million gives you the number of other winners you can expect. You also win about $93 million in smaller prizes. Taxes aren't too bad because you can claim your losses (which would be about $584 million). You still wind up about $13 million short. That's a large absolute number, but surprisingly small compared to the $584 million initial investment.\n\nThings are obviously worse when there are more tickets being sold. For example, 600 million tickets drops your expected payoff to $472 million. On the other hand, if you hold fixed 750 million ticket sales, the lottery would start to become profitable when the carry-over lump sum jackpot is more than $850 million, which might be close to the amount if no one wins on Wednesday.\n\nThis doesn't cover what would happen if you distributed the jackpot across a bunch of individuals. If you had enough, you might reasonably force each individual's payout well below the maximum federal tax threshold, in which case the taxes might be even less of a problem. But I'm also neither an accountant nor a lawyer, so I don't really know whether the logistics of this would work.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1452459555.0},{"title":"All of reddit should work together to win the powerball","author":"GorillaScrotum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/4089vo\/all_of_reddit_should_work_together_to_win_the\/","text":"If everyone on Reddit worked together to buy powerball tickets and we actually got the winning numbers, split amongst us that's still a life changing sum of money.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1452376212.0},{"title":"Let's all be millionaires (Reddit plays Powerball)","author":"lookitsnotyou","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/4096gs\/lets_all_be_millionaires_reddit_plays_powerball\/","text":"Write down your numbers you chose below and use ctrl+f to make sure no one has got that number. \n\nThe first five numbers (white balls) are chosen 1-69 and the single red one is chosen 1-26.

It also provided [this list of comment entries](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/ivgia66ztmvfsse\/list_of_comments.txt?dl=0), of which there were 8613.\n\nHere is that block hash, as verified by several block chain explorers:\n\n* https:\/\/www.biteasy.com\/blockchain\/blocks\/0000000000000000009cc3c998219caae131eb5504662f285a77725bea1062fc\n* https:\/\/www.blocktrail.com\/BTC\/block\/0000000000000000009cc3c998219caae131eb5504662f285a77725bea1062fc\n* https:\/\/blockr.io\/block\/info\/389738\n\nWe can now use our formula to determine the winning comment line from the list:\n\n> Line = (Block Hash **mod** Entry Count) + 1\n\nFilling in our variables:\n\n> Line = (0x0000000000000000009cc3c998219caae131eb5504662f285a77725bea1062fc **mod** 8613) + 1\n\nWe can plug this into Wolfram|Alpha:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.wolframalpha.com\/input\/?i=%280x0000000000000000009cc3c998219caae131eb5504662f285a77725bea1062fc+modulo+8613%29+%2B+1\n\nThis yields the winning line number, 5262.\n\nIf you open up [the list of comment entries](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/ivgia66ztmvfsse\/list_of_comments.txt?dl=0), you will see that line 5262 is comment id \"cy7ko5z\".\n\nLet's go back to this comment in the original entry thread:\n\n[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/3xrky6\/join_us_today_as_we_spread_the_holiday_cheer_to\/**cy7ko5z**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/3xrky6\/join_us_today_as_we_spread_the_holiday_cheer_to\/cy7ko5z)\n\nAnd we have our winner, \/u\/Sj119808!\n\n:)","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1450987781.0},{"title":"Join us in selecting the 14th winner!","author":"millionairemakers","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/3xwemd\/join_us_in_selecting_the_14th_winner\/","text":"###UPDATE: The winner has been chosen.

[Entry Thread #14]","author":"millionairemakers","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/3xrky6\/join_us_today_as_we_spread_the_holiday_cheer_to\/","text":"###Watch the drawing here: http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/nightvisionhawk\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n###[twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/reddit_million) | [mailing list](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/#!forum\/redditmillion)\n\n**TL;DR: Leave a comment on this thread. A random user will be chosen, and everyone donates a dollar to make a millionaire. Don't forget to upvote this thread!**\n\n**What is this, anyway?**\n \nA year ago, a redditor posted an idea in \/r\/Showerthoughts that speculated the fact that [If a million of us picked a certain redditor and all donated just $1, we would have the power to make someone a millionaire](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Showerthoughts\/comments\/2mq94c\/if_a_million_of_us_picked_a_certain_redditor_and\/).\n \nWe are now an embodiment of that showerthought, and this is our next attempt to make it happen.\n\n We **need** your help to keep this running, which only amounts to a $1 a month to make someone's day. Now how does it work? Look below.\n \n**How to enter:**\n \n* REQUIRED: Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. You can also follow [this link](http:\/\/bit.do\/mm14-3) and click send to be reminded to donate.\n \n**Important Rules:**\n \n* Only ONE top level *(not a reply)* comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP.\n \n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n \n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n \n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin, we recommend using [Changetip](http:\/\/changetip.com) to purchase bitcoin with your credit card. You can also use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or check out our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between where we made it it in \/r\/all and donations.\n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n \nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life. Help us to the front page, so we can make history, and...\n \n**LET'S MAKE A MILLIONAIRE!**","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1450740600.0},{"title":"I want to contribute to the last winner.","author":"I_am_anyone","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/3x8yzi\/i_want_to_contribute_to_the_last_winner\/","text":"I'm new to reddit and trying not to be a total newb with everything (even though I know I am).

I never even imagined when I started supporting this thread that I would ever be a winner, I just loved the concept and the idea and the people behind it... I'm completely overwhelmed, and I hope I do all this right.\n\nTo give some background on me, I'm a married man in my low 30s who works three different jobs to help make ends meet.  I'm building a farm for my wife, which is very slow going, as I can only build when I have money for materials.  This should help that. :)\n\nMy only real hobby is playing [Tagpro](\/r\/Tagpro) because I rarely have time for anything else.  I work so much that I've missed out on weddings, births, and so much in life.  As another user pointed out, maybe this win will help me get the confidence and the cushion to leave the office more and focus on my passions for a living while spending MORE time with my loved ones... we'll see.\n\nI think that's it... I hope I set everything up properly for rohlinxeg@gmail.com, but I guess we'll see.

If you post here I **will** reply to thank you, though my response will be delayed due to work. It's the least I can do to thank you for your kind words and your generosity.  I'll also call Paypal on my way to the office to try to make sure my account doesn't get locked. Over $200 in night one, wow... Since everyone loves totals, I'll put those below.  Thank you so much, and have a great night!\n\n**Update 2:**   **Paypal and Google Wallet issues resolved!**  I'm told that if you get a \"pocket error\" on changetip, that your balance may be too low.  Last update of the night--I'm finally home from work, going to spend some time with the wife and get some sleep.  I've updated totals below, I'm just speechless. Over $1,000 in 2 nights? Wow.  Thank you guys!  \n\n**Update 3:** I promised you guys some farm pictures, so [here are a few I snapped while working today.](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/N2nix) Finished the stall door just a few minutes ago!

So don't be a jerk.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

Though since there are not 1 million subscribers here, it would take a lot more to make an actual million dollar person.

Now, since not everyone is donating, at least I guess not everyone is based on the winners so far, that amount would have to be much higher. Assuming that only 2,500 people donate each time and we really wanted to make a millionaire, that number goes up to $400 per person. Quite a considerable difference.

We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Check out our twitter [here](https:\/\/twitter.com\/reddit_million)!\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in \/r\/all and donations.\n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n \nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**Advice:**\n \n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

But I wanted to explore the idea and possibly look at the caveats of following through with this proposal vs. not.*\n\n*Edit: Just as a clarification, this was by no means a suggestion to completely change the system MM already has, but to plant an idea into the minds of future winners if they wish to take the gamble.*\n\n.\n\n#Suggestion: Enter the Lottery\n\nOkay, before you bring your pitchforks and torches, let me explain my rationale. I really want the \/r\/MillionaireMakers to actually be true to its name, and it probably won't happen unless:\n\n1. We get a ton of exposure, and\/or\n2. We actually do something that warrants $1 million\n\n###Let me throw down some statistics for you\n\n^Warning: I'm a complete noob when it comes to lottery and gambling, so I'm going to pretend I know what I'm talking about.\n\n> [According to VegasClick.com](http:\/\/vegasclick.com\/gambling\/odds-win-million-dollars), the chances of winning a $4 million Texas Lotto is 1 in 8.6 million for $3. If, however, (using their calculator) **we use the donations from \/r\/MillionareMakers, and assuming we gather ~$5,000, the chances are 1 in 5,000.** That's a huge jump. Still a risk, but not as high.\n\nYou can also use small tips and tricks to minimize the chances of splitting prizes (if using Lotto) or increasing chances of winning with scratch cards:\n\n- [Buying more tickets at once](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/Which-lottery-strategy-has-better-odds-buying-one-ticket-for-many-games-over-time-or-buying-many-tickets-for-one-game) [will increase your chances](http:\/\/savingmoney.thefuntimesguide.com\/2015\/02\/scratch-off-tickets.php) of getting a winning ticket. \n- There are rumors that Lotto winners tend to buy their tickets on a Friday afternoon\/evening (I read that somewhere, but now I can't find the link).\n- Computer generated numbers for the Lotto (aka Quick Pick) is usually the best way to go because there is no sentimental value for the numbers, meaning less people will pick those numbers. *Anything below 31 is considered higher risk since they can be associated with dates, favorite numbers, birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, etc.*\n- There is a [list of numbers](http:\/\/www.txlottery.org\/export\/sites\/lottery\/Games\/Lotto_Texas\/Number_Frequency.html) [that have been more commonly picked](http:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/uk-news\/national-lottery-most-drawn-numbers-1407099) than others.\n- For scratch cards, you can do your research in your state and see which [lottery retailers have already cashed out](http:\/\/www.walottery.com\/WinnersGallery\/Default.aspx) their top prizes. STAY AWAY FROM THEM because the likelihood they'll have another top prize winner in the next 30 days is super low. Go to places with less customers (meaning less people probably won).\n- Each brand of scratch cards come in a \"roll\" (roughly 350-ish tickets per roll). Within those rolls will be smaller winnings and the \"top prize.\" Depending on the odds of winning, which will be written on the back, there can be anywhere from 25~100 tickets of small winnings to be paid out.\n- HOWEVER, **there is a catch.** 1) That specific roll you're buying from MAY NOT contain the winning prize. The odds of winning (i.e. 1:3) is for all those rolls in that STATE. That company\/brand may have spread 50 rolls of tickets across 25 retailers in Washington, and only a limited amount of those rolls will contain the top prize; and 2) lottery retailers are allowed to sell after the top prize has been given out, and they aren't obligated to tell you. And if that's the case, you literally have 0 chance of winning it. It's scummy, but it happens all the time. *That's why it's important to see if the top prize has been cashed previously.*\n\n.\n\nOkay, that was from my few hours of research. I went ahead and tested out all that I learned and bought my first few lottery tickets in my life a few days ago. And **[I won $100, albeit I did spend $50 in one go](http:\/\/imgur.com\/Dxb48PO).**\n\n.\n\n#TL;DR: If we strategically tackle the lottery, we may actually come away with a millionaire.\n\nIt's still risky. 1 in 5,000 chances is still very high, but not impossible. Think about if the numbers reached past $10,000 again like in [Season 2](http:\/\/redd.it\/2q9ung). \n\nPlease excuse me if I did my math wrong with anything. I'm not a math person. :(\n\n-----\n\n#Suggestion No. 2: Donate back to the donators\n\nLet's say in the slight chance this actually works, what if we encourage the newly made milionaire to donate back to the original donators? Give appreciation to the ones who helped them achieve their status.\n\nThis is what is called a *lottery hedge fund*. The only difference is (rather than equally splitting the money) the donators would only receive back what they originally gave (maybe x2 if the millionaire is feeling generous). That way, we're all happy. :D\n\n- We got to make a millionaire\n- We essentially didn't lose any money\n\nAnd then, if that DID happen, think about the exposure we would come across from winning the lottery. \/r\/MillionaireMakers would see a surge of publicity, and we wouldn't need to rely on the lottery method and go back to using the sub as it was originally intended (1 million people donating $1 to the winner).\n\n.\n\nIf you read all that, thanks. Hopefully it made sense! Would love to hear some honest thoughts. Skepticism and disdain welcome.","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1442936007.0},{"title":"Follow this link and click \"send\" to be reminded to enter the next drawing!","author":"Paltry_Digger","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose\/?to=RemindMeBot&amp;subject=Reminder&amp;message=%5Bhttp:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/MillionaireMakers\/about\/sticky%5D%20RemindMe!%20October%2023%202015%2010:30%20PM%20%22Enter%20the%20\/r\/MillionaireMakers%20drawing!%22","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1442804978.0},{"title":"Watch the 11th MillionaireMakers drawing here!","author":"minlite","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/3lmmsu\/watch_the_11th_millionairemakers_drawing_here\/","text":"Hi everyone!\n\nDrawing is live!!!\n\n**You can watch the live stream here: http:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/nightvisionhawk**\n\nPlease please please, if you can watch the twitch livestream, don't click the link below and keep it up for people who legitimately can't watch twitch (being on mobile, work, etc...) \n\n**THE WEBSITE CACHES THE LOG SO YOU'LL SEE THE RESULT WITH A 30 SECOND DELAY AND ALSO THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING MORE THAN YOU SEE IN THE STREAM.

We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word!

We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n \nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**Advice:**\n \n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

As we know, some people completely forget or simply don't know that they should come back and donate to the winner after they have entered into the drawing. As a possible solution, I think it's worth exploring the possibility of setting up an automated system, a bot, that goes through all the posts in the entry thread and sends a message to those users when the winning post is up, to donate. One of the mods messaged me and mentioned this could be problematic because if the users did not opt in, that notification could be construed as spam. As a way around this, we could simply include the mention of this automated system as part of the entry thread: \"you will be automatically notified when a winner has been chosen so that you can return for a donation\" or something along those lines.  \nOther possible challenges could be whether or not this bot would be effectively killed by whatever anti-spam mechanisms that may exist in place on Reddit.

Now how does it work? Look below.\n \n**How to enter:**\n \n* REQUIRED: Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate.

Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP.\n \n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n \n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n \n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in \/r\/all and donations.\n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n \nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**Advice:**\n \n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

I want to thank everyone who sent me personal message, all of the reddit and millionaire makers community! I visit Reddit daily, but don\u2019t contribute much. Many of my posts end up deleted before I even submit them.  So one night I was just lurking around reddit and saw the entry post on the front page. Well, I wrote that prophetic message without giving too much thought and went to bed.  Woke up, checked my inbox. I would be lying if I said that my hand aren\u2019t shaking while writing this! Thank you once again, it\u2019s great to be a part of this community!\n\nLittle about me. 18 year old guy, living in a small town in Eastern Europe. In fact, I graduated high school just a couple of days ago. This September I\u2019m moving to study to the Netherlands and you guys could help me a lot! For the past couple years I was working each summer to save some money to make this move possible, but I\u2019m not completely sure if I can make through the first year without taking a part time job or getting a loan. This move will change my life completely: living miles away from my home, friends and parents. It\u2019s like a new, clean page and every penny would help for that start! All of this money will go towards covering tuition fees and living costs.\n\nI\u2019m sorry if I am being incoherent. I\u2019m lost for words. It struck me like a lightning from a blue sky! \n\nAlso shout out to moderators, who made it possible to happen!\n\nEdit: OH my GOD! 3 hours have passed and we got about 550$! THANK YOU, sorry if I can't reply to every one of you. I'm aware that it isn't possible to make transactions through Google Wallet. As far as I know, it is country related issue. Still, thanks to every one of you!!! This means a lot.\n\nEdit 2: 6 hours in and the total is 1347$!!! This is a truly life changing event. Again, want to say thank you to all of you, you've made my life a ton easier! Thank you!!!\n\nEdit 3: 9 hours in. Total is around 1600$. Paypal limited my account, but you can still send donations. Hopefully my account won't get frozen until I will be able to submit all required proof. \n\nEdit 4: 18 hour. Holy crap just woke up and the total is 2400$! Man, this is really serious cash to me. You guys just basically covered my first year tuition fees. Thank you once again, unbelievable!\n\nEdit 5: We are 21 hours in. Total is around 2600$. OK, so Paypal thinks I'm running some kind of business here and asked for more proof. I explained the situation, but still haven't received any decision yet. My account is limited, but you can still send donations. I'm quite worried about this because for about 24 hours I will only be able to check the status occasionally so if Paypal goes down I won't be able to set it back up for a day or so. Anyway, even if the worst goes down I want to thank you all again. You guys made my year. Hell, it's not about the money now. You made me realize that small things can and will make a huge difference. \n\nEdit 6: Alright so Paypal has decided to close my account. Luckily, after some time I'll be able to withdraw that money. We've amassed about 2900$! I'll keep you updated from time to time.  \n\n**Edit 7**: Some of you asked me how much money I've received through different methods of payment. Paypal - 1602$(account frozen), changetip - 806$ and about 300$ came through cryptocurrencies (mostly bitcoin). No money in Google Wallet because of country related issues. Previously I made a mistake converting money so the real total is about 2700$. Probably this is the last update because the money flow is minimal now. Honestly, I was expecting 1000-1500$ at best. My first year tuition fee got covered (which is about 2100$) and I still have some money to pay for rent, books and stuff. Obviously I will give some money back to future winners, buy gold. Hopefully millionaire makers won't. It helped me a ton and I hope the next drawing will help you.

Stay tuned!\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**What is this, anyway?**\n \nEight months ago, a redditor posted an idea in \/r\/Showerthoughts that speculated the fact that [If a million of us picked a certain redditor and all donated just $1, we would have the power to make someone a millionaire](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Showerthoughts\/comments\/2mq94c\/if_a_million_of_us_picked_a_certain_redditor_and\/).\n \nWe are now an embodiment of that showerthought, and this is our next attempt to make it happen.\n\n We **need** your help to keep this running, which only amounts to a $1 a month to make someone's day. Now how does it work? Look below.\n \n**How to enter:**\n \n* REQUIRED: Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate.\n\n* OPTIONAL: [Last draw](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/3agbh5\/reddit_lets_make_a_millionaire_drawing_thread_8\/) we tested a method of entering which hashed users IP addresses in connection to their reddit usernames. This would help us to prevent mass entering of fake accounts and cheating if implemented. [Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/3b4tfd\/results_of_using_website_to_register_users\/) are the results of that test. \n\n We would now like to know your opinion and would appreciate if you'd take a short poll regarding your stance: http:\/\/strawpoll.me\/4951916. \n\n *See [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/37z1eq\/the_8th_drawing_will_be_june_19th_at_630_pm_est\/) for more information.*\n \n**Important Rules:**\n \n* Only ONE top level *(not a reply)* comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP.\n \n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person.\n \n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n \n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n \n**Reminders**\n \n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it.\n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/).\n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in \/r\/all and donations.\n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.**\n \nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n \n**Advice:**\n \n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n \n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n \nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n \nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n \nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n \nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

I read the rules and a few posts, and was wondering if there's a better way to use donations than \"raffles\".\n\nHere are a few problems that you may or may not have already thought of:\n\n1) The subreddit is divided. There are \"Givers\", \"Receivers\", and \"Passive participants\".\n\n* The \"Givers\" give and participate in the subreddit. They have a small chance of getting anything back, but they are the reason the subreddit exists.\n\n* The \"Receivers\" just receive benefits. The chance that they have given as well is relatively small, but they may become \"Givers\" afterwards (although the amount they give will be small comparatively).\n\n* \"Passive Participants\" make up the vast majority of the subreddit. These people participate, but they don't give or receive. This is the normal Reddit behavior on a subreddit.\n\n2) The idea is to make someone a millionaire. How does this benefit the community that accomplishes this goal? The reward is high for the individual \"winner\", but the community reward is too low.\n\n3) We like to imagine we know where our donations are going, but we can't really know.\n\n4) The process may be \"fair\", but it is not \"fun\" for most participants.\n\n5) There is no donation incentive.\n\n6) There are no ways to raise money besides donations.\n\nThere are even more problems that I haven't mentioned, but here is my suggestion to solve some of them:\n\n**Gamify the subreddit.**\n\nWhat does this mean? Gamification is the application of game playing to other areas of activity, such as this subreddit. Since the incentive is relatively large amounts of money, the potential for gamifying \/r\/millionairemakers is huge.\n\nGamification is actually quite easy, but making it effective is very difficult. The current subreddit form is actually already a \"game\"; the raffle. The rules are simple: Participate, and you have a chance to win. The chance to win is low, but the cost to play (only a few seconds or minutes of your time) is low as well. The original idea of the subreddit is similar: Low risk, high potential reward.\n\nWe can expand on this idea, and make something with more complex rules, higher participation rates, and even higher chances for rewards. On the other hand, we want to avoid becoming a lottery; that is not what I'm suggesting. I suggest keeping the cost to play at $0, but raise the chance to win, while making it \"fun\".\n\nI've been studying math, computer science, economics, and game theory for a while now, but I don't consider myself an expert at all. If you have a better idea, please feel free to share. Now, here's my idea:\n\n1) Restrict the amount of money given out, and save some for later. The original idea was that only $1 would be required per user. If a user donates $10, then it should go out to 10 people rather than just 1. This would also allow a \"community chest\" to build, which publicly keeps track of the amount of money raised, and would help users gain interest in participating. The limit wouldn't have to be $1, but could be $2, $3, etc., but something low enough to start building a community chest.\n\nThis would require a database that keeps track of individual donations that should not be tampered with, and it would also require the money to be held by a 3rd party. Donations would also be made public (the amounts only, not necessarily user names) so we can check the balance for ourselves. This brings up other problems, such as adding interest that builds up in the \"pot\" (because the money would be stored in a bank that would award interest).\n\n2) Provide a way for users to participate which would raise their potential chance to receive rewards. We want people to have an incentive to participate in the subreddit beyond commenting in the occasional raffle.\n\nWe could give donors the ability to skip having to participate in the next raffle, 1 skip per $1 or $2, but their name would still be entered. We could give activities to users where, if they complete it, they would have their name entered a second time. For example, add a link to the picture of your favorite chair to have your name entered twice. Or if you comment on this random thread our mod made in another subreddit as well, your name will be entered twice (secret mutually beneficial advertising).\n\n3) Provide the option for people to donate for others, which gives both participants \"skips\", limited to $10, or something like that. This would get people to interact with each other, and perhaps even spark mutual donations (I will donate 10 if you donate 10, which gives us double the participation). There would have to be a limit, in order to spread the love around.\n\n4) Give someone the chance to re-invest in the community after they win. For example, any money a winner donates will be worth 2 skips instead of 1. Or, any money a winner donates will go towards a community party, which will be held eventually for the community only using money that winners donate, or perhaps towards paying someone to gamify the subreddit better.\n\n5) Organize alternate ways of donating. For example, instead of donating money, someone could donate a piece of art, which someone else could \"buy\". The money for the art would go towards the subreddit, the art would go to the buyer, and the person who donated the art would get the relevant amount of skips.\n\n6) Give winners the chance to show what they did with the money. If a winner provides \"proof\", they will get special flair or something. This would be optional of course.\n\nAnyway, I have a ton more ideas. If you guys are interested in hearing more about these suggestions, or have some of your own, feel free to comment and I would be glad to respond.","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1434674484.0},{"title":"[MMGG] 2 Has Come to a Conclusion.

If you want, you may log in with the website. Here's how the process will go:\n\n1. You click the link for the website, which asks you to log in with reddit. This is so we know your username.\n\n2. After logging in with reddit, the website stores your information and redirects you back to the drawing. The website will store:\n\n* Your username (logging in with reddit prevents people from pretending to be you)\n* The time you logged in the website\n* Your hashed IP -- Hashing is a one-way method of securing data. Once your IP is hashed, we can never access your IP. Instead, let's say a user enters twice. We can see that they have the same hashed IP, so they are the same person.\n* Your hashed browser agent -- This allows us to see if two people are using the same browser. Once again, we cannot see the browser you are using.\n\nThis is all the website will store.\n\n**Using the website for this drawing will not affect your chance of winning in any way, and is by no means obligatory.** Instead, this will test that our system works and show how simple it really is. Because it is voluntary for this drawing, it will obviously not work to prevent alts. If this test proves successful, we can consider making it mandatory to enter on the website.\n\n**TL;DR: We're setting up a voluntary website for this drawing that will store hashed data that no one can access, even the mods. This is just a test, but it can be used in the future to prevent alts.** \n\n---\n\n**General MillionaireMakers FAQ:**\n\n\nWhat is this idea?\n\n> The idea is to make someone's day (or year!).

This is amazing and could not have come at a better time in my life. I'm going back to school this summer and am about to have a mountain of debt. While my university provides pretty good health insurance, it also looks like I may have some medical bills to pay soon. This is going to help me so much!!! I'm so excited exclamation points just don't cut it.\n\nI've loved reddit since the day we met but I never expected to benefit financially from this incredible community. Thanks to all the mods at \/r\/millionairemakers and the generous redditors who are already donating.\n\nThankyouthankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou\n\nCan't wait to tell my mom!\n\nOoo and if you choose to donate, please tell me one way you think I should spend a small amount to treat myself.\n\n**UPDATE:** After 8 hours, I have received nearly $1,300!!! You guys just paid for more than 10% of my first semester. Every dollar that you have donated lifts a piece of a burden I thought I'd have to carry for decades. I've never experienced such a sense of joy, relief, and excitement provided by so many caring strangers. There is no way for me to truly express my appreciation as I sit here with a blissed out goofy grin, waving my arms and clapping with each new contribution.\n\nI know everyone is eager to know the running totals so I will post another update either later tonight or early tomorrow morning. Probably won't be sleeping too much anyway. \n\nThanks again to all you amazing folks for making this one of the greatest days of my life!\n\n**Update 2** GOOD MORNING! I just woke up to another $1000 bringing the current total to $2300!  I just still can't believe this is happening. The donations keep coming in along with so many kind words and excellent suggestions. It has already been a deeply life-changing experience for me to be a part of this. I can't even begin to express my profound sense of gratitude for so many people coming together with such unexpected gestures of kindness. \n\nThank you so so much. And my mom was speechless when I told her. Gonna give her a morning update call right now! Be back soon everyone!\n\n**Update 3** Good evening all! Currently at $2700 and still rising! This is now more than 20% of my tuition for the summer. As many of you have astutely observed, my tuition is maybe a bit unreasonably high. I have no good explanation for this. I just try not to think about it too much or I would never sleep.  \n\n Classes start tomorrow. You will have made it possible for me to walk through those doors with a little more confidence and a lot less apprehension. Each one of you did that for me and I will never forget it. Thank you and good night.\n\n**Update 4** Still going! I hope everyone had a great weekend, especially those who were enjoying the holiday yesterday. I know I did because I'm now $3,200 less broke and it feels so good. I think tonight I have enough time to treat my mom. Gonna buy some slightly fancy groceries and cook a good meal at home. That's what she will appreciate the most. Thanks for making a random Tuesday night one to celebrate!\n\n**Update 4** $3600!!! You guys are great!

Now how does it work? Look below.\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n* Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. \n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only ONE top level (not a reply) comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments will result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP. \n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person. We also have an updated set of guidelines we are following to filter out cheaters, or old alts.\n\n\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it. \n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/). \n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in \/r\/all and donations. \n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.** \n\nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n\nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n\nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life.

Here's a referral if you want to get started.  https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/join\/prettig\n\n3. Delete personal information from your history.  Be thorough.  This is the internet.  Someone will stalk you and harass you and may try to steal your identity (and winnings).  \n\n4. Donate to previous winners.  If you don't use a tipbot, go back to the donation thread and post a comment that you made a donation.  People want to see that the winner participated in the past.  See the sidebar for previous winners.\n\n5. Set up strong passwords for your reddit account and your collection accounts.

Where basic math changes a life","author":"millionairemakers","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/33rtfy\/welcome_to_millionairemakers_drawing_thread_6\/","text":"#This drawing is closed\n\n\n**What is this, anyway?**\n\nTwo months ago, a redditor posted an idea in \/r\/Showerthoughts that speculated the fact that [If a million of us picked a certain redditor and all donated just $1, we would have the power to make someone a millionaire](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Showerthoughts\/comments\/2mq94c\/if_a_million_of_us_picked_a_certain_redditor_and\/). \n\nWe are now an embodiment of that showerthought, and this is our next attempt to make it happen. Now how does it work? Look below.\n\n**How to enter:**\n\n* Leave **one** (1) top level comment in reply to this thread! Replying to other comments will not count. We highly recommend commenting `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"`, this will remind you via PM to donate. \n\n**Important Rules:**\n\n* Only ONE top level (not a reply) comment per person, but feel free to reply to other comments. Making duplicate top level comments may result in exclusion from entering. Go to \/u\/me to ensure you don't accidentally double comment. Delete any extra duplicates ASAP. \n\n* Your account must be older than 30 days with some amount of activity. Obvious throwaway accounts with very minimal activity will also not be eligible. This is to prevent multiple entries from the same person. We also have an updated set of guidelines we are following to filter out cheaters, please stay tuned for an announcement.\n\n\n\n**How will the winner be picked and how can you donate?**\n\n* After **24 hours** this thread will close and the method of selection will begin.\n* The method can be read in detail [here](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/2ournt\/explanation_of_our_new_drawing_system_inspired_by\/)\n* Method TL;DR: we assign number by sorting the comments by old, so the first commenter will be 1. We then wait for a randomly generated block (a string of numbers) from Bitcoin's blockchain, and calculate the winner using the formula described in the post mentioned above.\n* The user who created the winning comment will be informed of their luck and will provide any information necessary for the chosen payment method (mods will help set this up if needed).\n* The generous Reddit community donates to this lucky person, hopefully making some worthy soul a millionaire!\n* The lucky redditor posts a thank you within the next days, revealing to the community exactly how much was raised and thanking the community for their generosity.\n\n**Reminders**\n\n* Take the time you have available now to setup your PayPal account and\/or cryptocurrency wallets. For Bitcoin you can use [Circle](https:\/\/www.circle.com\/) for instant credit card purchases or [Coinbase](https:\/\/www.coinbase.com\/) for purchases using your bank account.\n* Please try your best to donate a $1, no matter who wins. Every single dollar, cent, anything really counts, so please take the effort to remember and go through with it. \n* If you want to be reminded to donate, please comment `\"RemindMe! 2 days Donation for \/r\/millionairemakers\"` or checkout our [IFTTT recipes](\/r\/jaysamuel\/comments\/2wnvrw\/all_of_my_ifttt_recipes\/). \n* Spread the word! The more people who participate, the better this gets for everyone! There has been a cool correlation between were we made it it in \/r\/all and donations. \n* Try to cross-post this post to relevant subs. (Please don't spam other subs though. We're not trying to make any enemies here)\n* **If you are under 18, please talk to your parents to get their consent to participate and use their help to setup a PayPal account.** \n\nAt this point, Reddit, it's all up to you. Make us proud. Change the world. Prove the internet can do good.\n\n**Advice:**\n\n* If the community doesn't like you, even if you win, nobody will donate. So don't be a jerk.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**\n\nRemember, this is about generosity, about making history, and about coming together to make someone's life better. So take 3 minutes to donate a bit to the winner, whether you're well off and want to donate a few bucks, or going through tough times and can only donate a few cents. Every cent counts.\n\nNote about legality: This is NOT a lottery. You don't have to pay to enter. Also, WE are not giving any prizes away (the moderators will never even touch your donations). As for gift taxes, according to the IRS they're generally paid by the donor, and any donation under $14,000 is not taxable.\n\nThink of what you could do with $1,000,000... You could pay off student loans, have lifesaving surgery, or even give $1 to a million people!\n\nSo Reddit, thanks for sticking with us through that long post. It's finally time to change a life. Help us to the front page, so we can make history, and...\n\n**LET'S MAKE A MILLIONAIRE!**","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1429921913.0},{"title":"The drawing will open tomorrow at 8:30 PM EST","author":"Paltry_Digger","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/comments\/33o9vf\/the_drawing_will_open_tomorrow_at_830_pm_est\/","text":"#The drawing is now open, click [here](http:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/millionairemakers\/about\/sticky) to enter!\n\n~~EDIT: My wording has been a little confusing, this is NOT the drawing thread.

Do not post your referral here. We do not want to ruin this sub with people trying to get refs.\n\n2. Do comment about your experience with each website.

Also, if you've something better or country specific, post here and I'll add it to the list.\n\n**ExtraTip**: Lots of bitcoin wallets will pay people to register to their websites. I was lucky to register to Circle Wallet when they were giving free $5 for everyone who registered.\n\n**ExtraTip\u00b2**: Don't join PayToClick (ptc) websites. Don't join Autosurfers websites.

Same type of thing as the regular drawing but on the tiny (fun) size. \n\nMaybe we make it so each entry must post a joke with it (or what you will do if you win, your favorite song, what you do on Saturdays -- something silly) and  we draw the name, but instead of giving $1 or more to the winner we all try to give $0.05 (or $0.10 - whatever is good for everyone).  \n\nIt would be very easy to changetip the winner and it would get some activity to the sub between the \"big drawings\".\n\n\nNothing \"serious\" but maybe the winner walks away with a few bucks, it's fun, exciting, and more interactive then just waiting for the next \"real\" drawings.\n\n\n~\n\nAm I off base on this or does anyone else think it would be fun?\n\nThoughts?\n\n~\n\n**Update** Did not mean to offend anyone with my idea.
