Especially when the delivery drivers follow my \"the bell doesn't work please call my phone\" policy.\n\nHowever this one guy... He showed up reeking of weed, ten minutes late with cold pizza, claiming he had been buzzing for 10 minutes.... When I paid i pointed out that it states directly on the box to call my number. I was a bit mean but I only gave him 10% because he was rude.\n\nHalfway through eating with my SO after heating up the pizza, I get a text message from some random number saying \"you didn't tip enough, I'm downstairs.\"\n\nThis is 5 minutes ago and he keeps texting. We live in a secure building but I don't really know what to do. Any suggestions?\n\nEdit: we just got off the phone with the supposed manager of the place and he basically told us that he doesn't believe us and then he went on to accuse us of trying to get a free pizza before hanging up on us...\n\nEdit 2: dude was let into the building and is screaming at us through the door, was kind enough to say \"if you don't have anymore money you can suck my dick\" (I'm a girl) we called the non emergency police line. Cops are on their way.\n\nEdit 3: guy was arrested for driving under the influence and threatening my life through the door. Hurray. Guess who's manager was a lot more understanding when he spoke to the cops over the phone?",

        "text": "This happened last Valentine's day but I just found this sub.\n\nMy Fianc√© and I went to a popular local owned seafood restaurant.  \n\nBecause we knew it would get packed, we arrived pretty early.  I ordered a rum and coke and my SO ordered a sprite because he was driving.  The waitress brought me a rum and coke but brought SO a 7 and 7.  We explained the mistake to the waitress and I told her not to worry about it, I would drink the 7 and 7 and to please bring a sprite.\n\nWhen she brought our meals, she brought me the wrong meal.  She apologized and I assumed went to re-order my meal.  (I ordered crab legs)  Twenty minutes go by and my SO is finished eating and we are just waiting.  The waitress never returned to our table.  She didn't come by to refill his sprite or tell me my food was on its way, nothing.  \n\nI finally said, this is crazy and flagged her down and asked her to please cancel my order and get us our check.  I explained that we would pay for all the drinks and the food that SO ate but I wasn't paying for the food I ordered and never received.  About 5 minutes later she comes back to our table crying her eyes out.  I mean really sobbing.   Her manager told her that she had to pay for our meal.  My SO told her, no we will pay for what we ate/drank, please go get your manager.  \n\nThe manager comes to our table WITH MY FOOD.  At this point, I'm over eating.  I just want to get out of there.  I decline the food and ask again for our bill.  The manager storms off with the plate of food.  He comes back (we are on the second floor of the restaurant) and just stands on the other side of the room.   The waitress is waiting on customers but still sniffling.  My SO walks up to the manager and asked for again for our bill.  Tells him that we don't want the waitress to pay for our food and drinks that we don't have any problem paying our bill.  \n\nThe manager then starts loudly yelling at him, mind you this is in an area with many other diners.  Telling him that we planned this and did this on purpose to get a free meal out of them.  My SO is a big dude and doesn't take shit off anyone, but I was proud of him.  He just turned around and we left.  \n\nI'm sure that poor waitress ended up paying for our food and drinks but they wouldn't give us the bill.  I ended up eating peanut butter and jelly for dinner that night.\n",

The other employee sees this and just leads the other people in the proper line to  form the line behind me instead. The group sort of straighten out and I keep my mouth shut.\n\nIdk how long this other girl was waiting and it took about 15 minutes for me to get to the front. When I do finally get to the front, I tell her to order first. If I weren't broke from working in retail, I'd have paid for hers, too!\n\nShe seemed gratful for the small gesture of letting her go first, but I feel it was insufficient.",

After we had finished our main course, the dessert menus were given out and we took a look. The menu had two different sections - \"A la Carte Desserts\" and \"Market Desserts\", IIRC. The conversation went something like this:\n\n&gt; **Mum:** Hmm, I wonder what the difference is between the two sections.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Me:** Well, I notice that the market desserts don't seem to have a price next to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Mum:** I noticed that. Maybe that means they're free! \\*giggles\\*\n\nNow, I read /r/TalesFromRetail and if I've learned one thing, it's that *everybody* has heard the \"there's no price on this, so that means this must be free, right?\" joke and is sick to death of it...\n\n&gt; **Me:** *(sensing danger)* That's very unlikely. Also, just a note: Don't ever say that to any retail workers, they've heard that joke a million times before. Let's ask about the difference.\n\nSo, the next time our server came round, I asked. (Turns out that the market desserts were part of a set menu that you'd pay a fixed price for, whereas the a la carte desserts were available outside that menu.) I thanked the server, and then:\n\n&gt; **Mum:** Thank you. Since there were no prices next to the market desserts, we thought they must be free! \\*laughs\\*\n\nI internally facepalmed. I don't know if my Mum would have done anything differently had I not specifically said \"retail\" workers and included servers as well, but I suspect not.\n\nThe server, of course, laughed along with my Mum, but to me it seemed an obvious polite gesture and I had to wonder how many times she must have heard that.\n\nAll in all, the meal was lovely, but I hope my Mum keeps note of what I said for the future!",

        "text": "So I recently started a job working retail. I work in a print department of a big box store, and lately, I haven't been feeling well. After work, I headed over to the grocery store, grabbed my things, and managed to get into a line where someone was just leaving and paying out. Woo, for good luck, considering all the stores are absolute mad houses because of Thanksgiving this week.\n\nI pile all my stuff onto the belt and I'm making small talk with the delightful cashier that was ringing me out. We were making good time with the small amount of items I had. Suddenly, the lady that had been in line before me comes back after about five minutes and begins talking to my cashier. I wait for a moment and I'm putting things in my cart and I slightly expected the cashier to tell her to wait a moment for me to cash out, but I digress, she's too polite for that.\n\nFrom here on out, we will refer to the woman that left and returned as the entitled wench (E.W.) and me for... well, you know the drill.\n\n&gt; Me: Excuse me, but can she finish ringing me out before you you do this? (directed at the entitled wench.)\n\nEw gave me this look of absolute wtf as if me speaking to her is abolutely forbidden.\n\n&gt; E.W.: No because I was here first. (in a snotty tone.)\n\nI paused for a second and knew this was my chance. I had the chance that so many of us do not get. I could tell the lovely cashier didn't wish to deal with this lady, so I did:\n\n&gt; Me: Actually, no, you paid for your purchase and you left, then you came back in the middle of my transaction. Lady, I just got off work, I worked all day and I'm sick. I want to go home. You can wait until I'm through checking out.\n\n&gt; E.W.: Then I'm going to wait right here.\n\n&gt; Me: Yes, you will wait right there.\n\nShe looked at me as if no one in their right mind had ever put her in her place before. She quieted a moment and the lady that was checking me out helped me get my bags into my cart. I swiped my card and she was helping me when another associate came around. The cashier let the associate know that the lady was having an issue with her receipt, and that it was a matter of customer service. Meanwhile, I'm getting my receipt.\n\nAs E.W. and the other associate are walking away, I did the last thing she ever expected...\n\n&gt; Me: By the way, happy thanksgiving! (with my retail smile)\n\nShe sneered, rolls her eyes incredulously, and walked away. I had a short conversation with the cashier and she agreed that the woman should have waited until I was finished and no, she is not the only person in the world. I wished her a Happy Thanksgiving and went on my way.",

        "text": "About a month ago I went with a friend of mine to a popular clothing and homegoods store that's known for their [Store]Cash and scratch off percentage discounts at the register. We stopped by the customer service counter to pick up a little handheld to make my baby registry with and as we were waiting I spotted a little coupon stack that advertised $10 off $50 in Women's Apparel, so naturally I grabbed one.\n\nWe meander around, making my registry, and I go ahead and pick out some clothes for myself. Now to be honest, the section I was in could easily have been confused for either Women's OR Youth as it was primarily workout clothing and was situated between the two sections, and I wasn't entirely sure if what I was picking out qualified.\n\nSo we get to the register and this wonderful bubbly woman starts ringing up my friend, and noticing my PDA, starts small talk with us about baby things... asking if it's my first, it is, and if I know the gender yet or have names picked out. Just general baby talk. At this point she gives my friend two scratch offs, saying she'll apply the larger one to the transaction. They're both 30% off, so she uses one and tosses the other.\n\nNext it's my turn, and as she's ringing me up I admit that I wasn't entirely sure if the clothing I picked out applied to the coupon, and if it didn't, to not worry about it. As she tries to apply it the computer denies it and I tell her it's my fault for not paying better attention and that it's not a big deal. Instead, she just shushes me with a big smile on her face and overrides the computer, approving the coupon manually. As i'm trying to tell her that it isn't necessary, she insists that it's perfectly fine and presents me with two scratch offs, which are both 15%. I guess that wasn't good enough for her, because she tossed them both and dug out my friend's second 30% and used it on my transaction. I could have cried, she was just so sweet and giddy and told me that she understands the stress of a first baby, and to treat myself a little. Needless to say I went home and filled out that survey on the bottom of the receipt, making sure to give the best marks for the beautiful soul behind the register.",

I don't own a credit card           so I normally go to store and pay cash.  \n\nAnyway I found a great price on Amazon for this vacuum.  Before I left my house I called this store and they said they would price match since I found the price on Amazon and on their own website. Since I had confirmation I went to the store. I should mention I live in a small town and I have an hour drive to get to this store. I get back to vacuum isle and turns out they don't have this particular vacuum on the floor. The Department manger sees me looking around and asks if I need help. I show him, we'll call him Ricky for this case, the ad from Amazon on their store website, he goes in the back and gets the a vacuum. All is going well, we pick up a other few items and then make our way to the check out.  \n\nWe make it to the register, I put up the items in our cart but leave the vacuum. I tell our Cashieer Lucy, that I want to price match it. She says that's fine and we'll call a supervision over after everything is rung up. Everything is scanned and she calls her supervisor Becky over, Becky comes over looks at the vacuum. Says they are the same but says they should confirm it with the other supervision Meg. Meg is busy at the moment, so we wait. At this point I pull up the same price on my phone and  show them it was just printed off. Meg finally comes over and says it's the same vacuum.  \n \nMeg says they should confirm it's the same vacuum so the they call the Department manger Ricky. Ricky comes out says it the same and they are good to do the Price Match. Well the Assistant Store Manager Rob sees all this going on, and comes over. He comes over and says they can't do any price matches from their own website. That's fine I have an print out from Amazon too. He looks at this and says we can't price match this item. I ask him why, he looks at me and says \"Either accept it or get the f***      out\"     We left our cart, all the items we wished to purchase there at the register and left.  I emailed corporate but I am not holding my breath.  \n\nTl;dr I had three people tell me a vacuum could be price matched but the assistant  store manager said it couldn't. He didn't give a reason and told me to get out.  \n\nI apologize for any formating issues. \n\n\nUPDATE: \nStore manger has now been fired. I called and retold the story, they apologized for what he said. He was fired today and Meg was fired too. \n\nUPDATE - 11/23 I had the EXACT same vacuum priced matched at another store for the same price. No issues, no hassle, just a lowered price. ",

        "text": "It's a big bank. One of the biggest. And they've got a pretty decent reputation, as big banks go. Until they lose like $10,000 worth of your bond certificates and demand that you fix it on your time.\n\nBy the way, this is happening right now. I am living the middle of this story.\n\nSo, beginning at the beginning. My father recently passed away, and while going through his papers, my family found two old savings bonds with my name on them, presumably forgotten. On their face, it looks like they're worth a total of $10,000! Woohoo, right? Take these suckers down to my bank! I mean, my dad is dead, but hey, money.\n\nSo I go to my local branch of enormous Moron Bank, I'll call it M Bank, here in Washington. Nice lady whose name I know but will not share - we'll just call her Incompetent Moron Prime (or IMP for short) - takes my bonds and gives me a form to sign. Alright, all good. She photocopies everything - the bonds and the form, which also doubles as a receipt and includes her signature and a line-item inventory of the securities she's taking. I watch her put the thing in what looks like a courier service envelope.\n\n\"How long is this going to take?\" Reasonable question.\n\n\"Like 2-4 weeks,\" she says. Bummer, but alright. Still a lot of money right?\n\n\"And the money will just appear in my account when it's done?\"\n\n\"Yup. You're all set.\"\n\nI paraphrase (and I will continue to do so), but you get the gist.\n\nA week goes by. Nothing. Alright, that's to be expected. Two weeks go by. Still nothing. I realize that I have no way of tracking the progress of this tremendous amount of money, and I get antsy, because I'm a millennial, and I'm used to being able to check a website to see how much longer my Chinese food will take. And instead of Chinese food, this is $10,000. So I call the branch again.\n\n\"Hey, I gave you such and such bonds. I have so and so receipt. Is there any way to check on the status of this?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure it's fine. We haven't heard anything about this from the back office. Which means there's no problem, and we're still on track. They'd call us if there were a problem.\"\n\n\"That's what I needed to hear. Great. Thanks.\"\n\nBut then I think about it for like ten seconds and I realize the obvious: they also wouldn't call if they never got the things. So I check their website, and I get the direct number to their back office in Maine that handles this stuff. Keep in mind it's been almost a month at this point. Call up the Maine office.\n\n\"Hey, do you know about my bonds with such and such account and my name is so and so? For like ten grand.\"\n\n\"Hmm, I don't see that. Can I call you back?\"\n\n\"Uhhh ... okay.\"\n\nBrrring.\n\n\"So, hey, I don't see them in our tracking system, but we're transitioning some things right now. I'm sure they'll turn up here. And I'll call the branch to find the tracking number on the package they used.\"\n\n\"Did you guys lose these things?\"\n\n\"No no no, I've never heard of that happening before. I'm sure they're here. We'll find them. Can I call you back?\"\n\n\"Uhh ... okay.\"\n\nBrrring.\n\n\"They're gone. The branch didn't use a courier. There is no tracking number. We have no idea where they are. They're gone.\"\n\n\"What now?\"\n\n\"The branch had them, but they never made it here. The branch you gave them to is the last people with a record of having them, so they're responsible.\"\n\n\"You guys LOST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Do you have the receipt?\"\n\n\"Yeah, it's got IMP's name on it.\"\n\n\"Okay, I'm gonna give you the branch's phone number, one of the managers of the branch, and they'll work out something for you. I'm sure they'll give you some sort of credit for this, because I've never heard of this before, and it's really bad.\"\n\n\"I'm really pissed.\"\n\n\"I would be too.\"\n\nClick.\n\nSo, end Act I. In which we meet our characters - me, the struggling government policy analyst who thought he had lucked into a significant bailout following the death of his father, and some of the various voices within the inept viscous mass known as M Bank. And we see the central conflict - I give a bank ten grand worth of savings bonds, and THEY LOSE THEM. And they don't even realize that they've lost the things until I point it out to them. They admit right away what they've done, but we've yet to meet the incompetentest moron, whom I will call Queen Dookie, because deep down I'm six years old. QD will add shamelessness, CYA cowardice, and callous disregard for her customers' time and basic humanity to the incompetence stew.\n\nWe'll see if I write up act 2. Because it doesn't end well.",

        "text": "Hi!  Long time lurker, first time poster here.  I'll make this as short and sweet as possible.  \n\nToday, like most days, I decided to grab a coffee from the shop on my break from work.  Everything was going accordingly to plan:  I order my coffee, hand the cashier my debit card (this is important), she swipes it.  \n\nThen trouble ensues.\n\nInstead of typing in 2.79 into the credit card machine, she first presses \"3.\"  This is where the fun starts.\n\nThe \"3\" button get's stuck down.  Instead of hitting \"back\" or \"cancel\" on the machine, I guess she figures \"fuck it,\" and submits the payment.  From here on, I'll me \"M\" and the cashier will be \"C.\" (Creative, I know.) \n\n&gt;C: Oh Shit.  I overcharged you.  But it's not my fault.\n\n&gt;M: How badly?\n\n&gt;C: Don't worry about it.\n\n&gt;M: How badly?\n\n&gt;C: My manager will take care of it.\n\n&gt;M: What did you charge me?\n\n&gt;C: I dont want to worry you.  (If I wasn't panicking before...)\n\nSo, I guess this women forgot that the internet exists.  I whip out my phone and login to my bank account.\n\n&gt;[And I drop the fucking phone.](http://i.imgur.com/6N3JBAW.jpg?1)\n\n&gt;M: Where's your manager?\n\n&gt;C: I texted him, but he's out at the bank or something and not responding.  \n&gt;M: Did he say when he'd be back?\n\n&gt;C: He said he'd be about a half hour.  You know, this isn't my fault.\n\n&gt;M: How long ago did he leave?\n\n&gt;C: The key got stuck. It's not my fault.\n\n&gt;M: How long ago did your manager leave?\n\n&gt;C: You know, I haven't been here very long.  He shouldn't even have me working here alone. This isn't my fault.  (It's like 2pm.  There is only one other customer.  Not really a busy time).\n\n&gt;M: I have a meeting with my boss. Can you give me an idea how long it will be?\n\n&gt;C: Here *shoves a piece of paper at me* This is his number.  You text him.\n\n&gt;M: Wait, what?!\n\n&gt;C:  He wont answer if I call.  And it's not my fault, so I shouldn't have to call him.  Plus there are other customers (now 2) that I have to deal with.\n\n&gt;M:  Ummm...ok.  *I very politely text this guy, but get no response*.\n\nOver the next 20 min, between every customer, the cashier makes a point of asking me if her boss responded to me yet, and reminding me that this isn't her fault.\n\nLong story short, the manager finally shows up.  He's really great.  After several calls to the bank and the credit card machine manufacturer, we think everything's straightened out.  I have a receipt showing that the sale was voided.  My bank sees the charge and has a note on the account that it was a mis-charge (though, during all this time, I never got a fraud call, which boggles my mind...).  The void won't go through on the shop's end until they close out tonight...which means I won't know until tomorrow whether this is actually cleared up.  I don't have a ton of faith in the shop, but my fingers and toes are crossed.\n\nAnd that's the story of the $33,333.33 coffee and how I mega overdrew my account.  Also, ^It's ^not ^her ^fault.\n    \n**UPDATE:**  Lack of faith in the shop: confirmed.  My bank has no record of the reversal.  FML\n\n**UPDATE 2:**  I went to the shop, who says they can't help.  They ran a reversal and now it's out of their hands.  So, I stopped by the bank.  The bank has NO IDEA how a charge this large was approved.  They did tell me; however, that the reason this wasn't flagged by fraud was because the fraud algorithm checks for the location of purchase, not amount.  I call bullshit, but it's not worth arguing over.\n\nPossibly okay-ish news is that the bank says that, though the charge looks like $33k on my end, they only actually approved it for $2500-ish...which is the total I had in my checking and savings (overdraft protection for the ~~win~~ fail.  Store's reversal should only be for the $2500 amount and not the $33k.\n\nBad news is, I can't do ANYTHING with my accounts until at least the purchase goes through completely (It's still listed as pending).  They *think* things should be cleared up by Monday...which is a long ass time and is making me super nervous.  I can't access my money, in either account.  I can't cancel the overdraft protection.  Nothing.  \n\nSo, on top of all that, overdraft protection is causing nightmares too.  It obviously cleared out my savings.  Then I was assessed an \"overdraft protection fee\" in my checking account.  That, of course, overdrafted me again.  So, my checking pulled non-existant money (because \"pending\") out of my savings account, to cover the fee-caused overdraft.  You guessed it: Now I'm getting hit with an overdraft fee in my savings.  And there is NOTHING I can do about it until this fucking initial purchase clears.  Once everything is rectified, I can \"petition to have the charges reversed\" and they'll \"try to work with me.\"  \n\nSpeaking of Monday...the reason I have to wait so long: The manager is the only one who can close the shop.  He only worked until 6.  They store closed at 8.  He didn't feel like coming in to close...so he did it this morning.  Fuck.\n\n**UPDATE 3:** The bank did refund all the overdraft fees, but the reversal still hasn't gone through.  The bank told me to call back tomorrow.  Worst case, my money should be back by Wednesday.  This has gone on far too long.  Why, in the digital age, is figuring this out so difficult?!\n\n**UPDATE 3:**  Wednesday I finally got everything resolved.  Money is back.  All overdraft fees are gone.  Lesson learned: NO MORE DEBIT CARDS.  That was the week from hell.",

It was a $10 charge and I added a $2 tip.\n\nThe delivery guy got here pretty quickly, and when I open the door he seems like he's in a hurry. I say hello and he says \"Yeah we're not supposed to deliver here.\"\n\n&gt;\"Huh?\" I said.\n\n&gt;\"There's a glitch in the system online that says we can, but we're not supposed to.\"\n\n&gt;\"Oh, I'm sorry.\"\n\nHe didn't really say anything after that. I signed the paper, and he nearly dropped the food on the ground he got out of there so fast. I watched as he threw the door open out of our office building and stormed to his car. I could hear him peel out of our parking lot. He was definitely really angry.\n\nI didn't know that they couldn't deliver here but it just caught me by surprise how mad he was. I'm honestly afraid to eat the food I got right now.",

Of course, it was a Monday and my bf and I wanted Thai food. There are a lot of other options in the area but I chose the one that was the closest since it was already getting late.  I called in the order to pickup (2 orders of Pad Thai, nothing special) and was quoted 40 minutes which seemed excessive but I didn't think too much of it.\n\nI showed up 45 minutes later, and there is only one table of customers in the whole place, which seemed odd. A man comes to greet me and asks if I will be dining in. I told him I placed a phone order.  He seemed confused and went to the back to check, but first went to help the lone table. He came back and asked if I was sure that I placed the order at this restaurant and I told him yes, I spoke to a woman and was quoted 40 minutes. He went into the back again and returned telling me that his wife (the only other person working apparently) must have forgotten to write down the order.  He proceeded to start asking me what I would like to order without really apologizing for the mistake. At this point, I was hangry and not about to wait another 40 minutes for what would probably be questionable food, so I left and got something else to eat.\n\nWith at least 10 Thai restaurants in a 10 minute radius, how is this place still in business?",

Nothing showed up. No autorenewal or anything!\n\n\nHe disputed the charges with PP and after a week or two they refund him.\n\nHe logs in, or tries too atleast, on his ps4 to find out he has been blocked. We had no idea what for until we connected to live chat support. They said there was a debt of $14.97 and they would not reactive his account until a day after it was paid. \n\n\nThey went back and forth for a bit saying he didn't approve the charge and the support guy saying he must have.\n\nMy husband asked a few times what the charge was for, the first time just being told it was a wallet funding. After it being questioned a few more times the support said it was an autorenewal for a game that hasn't been played in a month, and autorenewal is turned off.\n\n\nSupport insists it is and they can see autorenewal is on now.  So they are refusing to help us until we pay a debt we didn't even approve of in the first place and until we pay we are locked out of his account and all his digital games.",

A lot of times I didn't want to leave a tip but as was our intention to return, my SO didn't want the waitresses to hate us and leave one.\n\nAfter a few months they recognize us as regular customers, so this day we arrive, greet a couple of waitresses and took seats, 10 minutes and nothing... wasn't a big deal as we knew it was part of the place, they were now 20 minutes and tables around us begin to fill and we try to get the waitress attention but nothing. After a half hour we were really hungry when we finally see the waitress approaching to us, but instead of that she started to take the order from the near table who only have been there like 5 or 10 min so I got mad,  I stand up and in a loud tone say \"we're leaving\" I didn't expect someone came to us with a red carpet but at least a little \"sorry, I'll attend you in a moment\" but the waitress just look at us by a second and keep taking the order. As we were hungry, didn't complain with the manager and just went to a nearby restaurant and swore we'll never return. 'Till today every time we pass by there, I have to remember myself their awful service and buy amaranth in another place.\n\nEDIT: typo",

There's also a sign on the counter that says the same thing.\n\nI would have been alright, again, had the man been polite.  Had he said something along the lines of \"Sorry, it's store policy\" or \"I'm sorry the wording wasn't clear on the receipt\", then I wouldn't be writing this.\n\nInstead, the man yelled and yelled, getting more and more belligerent.  When I asked him to explain why I couldn't get store credit as it says on the receipt, he just kept yelling \"All sales final!\" repeatedly.  When I asked why he was getting so angry, he responded, \"Sue me!  Just sue me!\".\n\nBasically, he would prefer to yell over a price inconsequential enough not to be sued over, rather than honor the words printed on the receipt.  All over $11 of store credit.  Keep in mind, the minimum price of any watch there was $75, so he lost a profit for no good reason.",

I posted this story earlier on r/TalesFromRetail but it wasn‚Äôt added to the subreddit.  I suspect it wasn‚Äôt because this didn't actually happen to me but to the employees at our local grocery store the other day. I was only a witness but I hope you find the story entertaining all the same.  I've been a long time lurker and this is my first post on this subreddit. I'm still a bit new to posting so please forgive any errors. SO = significant other , Me = me , OM = old man in the motorized shopping cart of doom , Cashier = cashier , Manager = manager , RE = random employee . TL;DR at bottom.\n\n\nSO and I finished our shopping and went to one of the registers. The first giveaway should have been that the couple in front of us ditched their spot to go to another register. I just figured it was luck and claimed the spot in line. In front of us was an old man in a motorized shopping cart. I thought, ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶‚Äù And sure enough, there was a plastic bag filled with frozen burritos all set to go in his shopping basket along with some fairly sugary cereal. His basket was also filled with an array of sodas. The burritos and cereal were bagged and must have been purchased already but the price of the soda was what was currently being debated between OM and Cashier.\n\nOM: It was 12 for $X!\n\nThe cashier was looking at him with an exhausted expression, I‚Äôm sure he had already told OM the truth that he didn‚Äôt want to hear. \n\nManager: (*takes over for cashier*) Sir, these are 10 for $X. \n\nThe situation has also called for what appears to be another manager to the scene. OM also had the attention of the cashier at the next register plus the bagger. This OM is literally surrounded by 5 of the stores employees who either are trying to help or just watching the spectacle go down. SO made a grab for our basket to go to another register but I signaled for him to stop. I wanted to stay and watch the show. \n\nRE: (*walks up out of nowhere, probably just came back from checking the sale*) The sale is 10 for $X. \n\nOM: (*mumbles something while clearly upset and hands money to the manager*) I don‚Äôt want this one then!\n\nThe manager takes the money and goes through the different prices of the soda and the flavors on sale but OM is still angry. (*I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm hard of hearing and was not trying to make it obvious I was listening in while still leaning in with my good ear. I didn‚Äôt catch word-for-word but this is the jist of what she was talking about with OM*)\n\nM: OK sir, please follow *RE‚Äôs name* and you can pick out the ones you want under $15. \n\nOM: I gave you $25!!\n\nM: You gave me $15, **my dear**. ((*You go girl, kill him with kindness!*))\n\nOM still looks angry as he scoots away on his motorized cart. SO and I go up to the cashier who now looks visibly upset and is very quiet. I felt so bad for him and tried to say something funny (‚ÄúThat was a weird guy.‚Äù) and even mentioned how OM had mistaken another customer as an employee earlier. The cashier managed to crack a smile at least. But this old man just had a full day of terrorizing grocery store employees and customers alike on his scooter cart of doom. \n\n\n**TL;DR** An old man in his scooter of doom flies through our local grocery store terrorizing customers by treating them like employees (story in link) and pissing off real employees by debating the prices of soda and sales. When his plan doesn‚Äôt work he tries to claim he gave them more money than he actually did and the manager kills him with kindness. He scoots away to terrorize another day, maybe one day he‚Äôll scoot to a store near you. \n",

They are volunteers and they can clearly hear you ranting but that's not making things go any faster. You need to back away from me a couple inches and don't speak to me again because your comments are not called for.\n&gt;Lady: (shut the hell up after that)\n\nWhen I got up to the volunteers they thanked me for waiting and apologized but I told them they were not at all to blame. I told them not to let the next lady behind me bother them because I'm sure she had a few words to say after I left.",

        "text": "**Note: I had posted this on /r/ProRevenge and was told it was more for this reddit...**\n\nThis story occurred in 1993...\n\nIn Qu√©bec, student loans are very regulated. The government decides how much you get and sends you a loan certificate you take to your bank. T\n\nThat certificate is like a certified check: it clears instantly, cannot be blocked for processing, and until you graduate, your loan doesn't show anywhere.\n\nThe keep point however, is that they cannot be locked, blocked, etc... you deposit them and the money is available RIGHT AWAY.\n\nMy bank was at the end of my street. It's on the longest street of my city (only about 7KM, but still, I live near the west end).\n\nThe next day, I go to the bank and try to withdraw money only to find my account locked. Not just the bank loan, but the whole amount (granted, there wasn't much before that).\n\nI talk to the people at the counter and they don't understand so they unblock my account and I can withdraw.\n\nA few days later, account locked again, I repeat the process and can withdraw.\n\nBut a week later, when it gets locked for the 3rd time, the head office had put a hard lock on it explaining I was participating in check fraud. The bank personally intimidated me and explained that this kind of action is illegal and that I will probably end up in jail.\n\nI profess my ignorance of the matter, but he explains that the main office knows everything and that the police are involved. I almost get kicked out.\n\n**Calling the police**\n\nSo, I walk home and call the police to get more information. I tell them the summary of the story and they send a detective over, in uniform and a cop car.\n\nOn location, I explain in more depths, including about my student loans. I am 99% sure he will tell me that this is a civil matter and that you can't take on a bank, and he pretty much does.\n\nBut I ask, can't I press charges of theft since they are no letting me get to my loans?\n\nHe thinks long and then says, you can, but they won't stick...\n\n\"Even if I am a minor?\" ( I was 17).\n\nThat's what changed the deal... The detective REALLY, REALLY didn't like that the bank manager raise his voice against a minor. It REALLY pissed him off.\n\nAgainst an adult? Sure, but a minor? He knew he couldn't do much legally, but he had an idea...\n\n**The Resolve**\n\nHe drove me to the bank and we entered. The police officer loudly asked to talk to the manager and when he arrive, the manager looked smug. He had told me less and an hour ago that I was crook and here I was with a police officer.\n\nBut much to his dismay, the officer explained that I was pressing charges against him for theft and fraud and that he wanted to know his name to get a proper warrant.\n\nThe bank manager didn't like it one bit and tried to turn the tables around, often bubbling and being confused, but the police officer just stayed there, listening. (my old neighbor was a police officer and he told me numerous time one of the greatest qualities a good police officer can have is to just listen while the suspect incriminates himself!).\n\nEventually, we all went in the bank manager's office and we straightened everything out...\n\n**The cause**\n\nRemember that long road? on the other end of the same street, there is another branch of the same bank. A guy with the same folio (bank account number) as me, but at the other branch, was the guy doing fraud.\n\nThere were 3 branches in my city, 2 listed at the bottom right of a page listing all of the branches, and his branch at the top of the next page.\n\nWhenever it was time to lock his account (something then done manually), the guys at the bank would probably go \"Lock account #1234567 at the branch of the city of #######\", \"Which one, there are 2\", \"The one on main street\", and then, my account would be locked...\n\nAt least, that the explaining the bank manager cooked up.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Used to drive a Big Car Manufacturer car. It was a little thing, cute and compact. After owning this car for about a year, I was in a minor collision. No one was hurt, but the drivers side mirror shattered. \n\nWhile I am usually very against going to the dealership for repairs, I figured this would be an easy fix. I didn't want to wait too long because I didn't feel safe driving without a driver's side mirror. \n\nI bring it in and I end up waiting a while. No big deal. It's not like I have an appointment or anything. Eventually this guy comes up and talks to me. We'll just call him Mechanic. Keep in mind, that every word he said was in this condescending tone. Like how cute it was that a 20 year old 125lb. girl was getting her car fixed *all by herself.* \n\nHere's how our conversation went down. \n\n**Mechanic:** So I see you messed up your mirror.\n\n**Me:** Yeah, I'd definitely like to get it replaced today, if possible.\n\n**Mechanic:** Well, first things first. There's a recall on (some tiny portion of the interior passenger light) that we'd like to get fixed right away. Shouldn't take too long. \n\n**Me:** Okay, fine. \n\n**Mechanic:** And I've run the numbers on your driver's side mirror and the price is going to come out to be $417. \n\n**Me (appalled):** \"You want $417 to glue a piece of glass onto the side of my car?\"\n\nFor a moment here he drops the condescending act. Apparently he didn't expect me to call him on this. But he made sure to pick it right back up again.\n\n**Mechanic:** Well, it's not just the mirror that needs replacing, it's the entire module. (Meaning [this] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Car-SideMirror.jpg))\n\n**Me:** \"And that costs $417?\"\n\n**Mechanic:** \"Well, if we don't paint it to match the rest of the car, it's $375.\"\n\n**Me:** \"How much if you don't fix the recall?\"\n\n**Mechanic:** \"The recall is free.\"\n\nI was pretty pissed off, but I just told him to order the part. I also made sure he didn't bother to paint it. I wasn't about to spend nearly $45 on less than a square foot of ugly gold paint. He told me to come back a few days later.\n\nI went home and told my Dad what happened. Keep in mind, my father is 6 foot 4 inches, with a 32 inch chest. He is a big guy. He's a total teddy bear, but a big guy nonetheless. He reiterates what I already know: This guy is trying to con me. \n\nWe go back on the allotted day and I take my Dad with me. At the sight of him, Mechanic starts whistling a different tune. Suddenly, the price is only $300. Still too much, but better. We leave him with my car and he says it shouldn't be more than an hour and a half. \n\nTwo hours pass and he calls me. \n\n**Mechanic:** \"Miss CrookedCircus? I'm afraid there's been a problem. The good news is, we've swapped out the recalled part. The bad news is, your part hasn't come in yet, and it will be another week.\"\n\nNow, I am livid. Not only did he not bother to check if my part was in in the full seven hours they were open, he kept my car and wasted my time for a full half hour past the allotted time for the labor. Both my Dad and I took time off of work for this and my mirror is still busted. \n\nWhen we got home, we decided to do some research. We found the exact part I needed for my car model on the internet for $30 (and free shipping!)\n\nI called the dealership back and told them where they could shove it. My Dad and I fixed my mirror in less than 20 minutes and it worked like a charm until that car retired. \n\ntl;dr: Misogynist dealership mechanic tries to sell me a small part for over $400, then keeps my car for two hours before telling me he can't do the work for another full week. We find the part online for $30 and fix the damn thing ourselves. Mechanic can go fuck himself.\n\n\nEdit- I cannot edit the title. However, I will agree that calling the guy a misogynist may be a bit unfair. While he did talk down to me and stopped when my Dad came along, that does not necessarily mean he was a misogynist. He was, however, an asshole who tried to rip me off. ",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I frequent a local Indian food restaurant. It is our absolute favorite. The food is a little expensive, but it is always to die for and comes in huge portions.\n\nNow, I have worked in the restaurant industry and I know full well how difficult it is. Because of this I *never* complain and I *always* tip *at least* 20%, if not higher. Even if the service is bad. \n\nThat night, I picked up my boyfriend from work at 6 in the evening. We both suffer from low blood sugar and we were starving. He'd worked a long day and I thought we'd go to our favorite place and unwind. \n\nNow, this restaurant is never crowded. Usually there's maybe three or four tables at a time, out of 20. On the night in question, there's maybe six or seven, including ourselves.  Now, I realize that's busy for them, but that's really not *that* busy. In all the restaurants I've worked in, one server's section alone would be between six and eight tables. And they had two or three servers on the floor. \n\nThe first red flag was where they seated us. They put us in the corner by the door. I've never been seated in this area before, but I know from others who frequent the restaurant that sometimes that section is forgotten. \n\nThese guys always take a little longer than most restaurants, but it was a good 30 minutes before our order was taken. This would have been fine, but no one spoke to us until that moment. We were ready to order from the moment we walked in the door, and said so. \n\nThen we waited. And waited. And waited. No one came to speak to us. There was no explanation or apology. The servers just moved around the serving floor, blatantly avoiding eye contact with us. Another table who had also already ordered got up and left. We probably should have done the same, but we were already there and we'd already waited this long. \n\nOur food didn't come for a full two hours. As I said, my boyfriend gets low blood sugar, and I have full blown hypoglycemia. Feeling faint and livid, we were finally able to reap the rewards of our patience. \n\nFor the first time in nearly two years that I've been eating here, the food was awful. My chicken curry, which is usually so large that I am still eating it the next day, was tiny, the chicken was all fat, and it was cold. \n\nWhen the check came out, I actually had a moment of crisis. I have *never* not tipped before. But this was by far the worse restaurant experience I have ever had. I wrote a small note of apology and explanation on the receipt, and left the tip line blank.",

Often my shift would start either after hers did, or end just before hers did, so I would always stop by and buy myself something to drink and get her an iced tea.\n\nNow, we're both female and live in Texas, but we never really put our relationship out in the open and were pretty professional in whichever work place, though some of her coworkers know \n\nOne day, her shift was about to end in 30 or so minutes,  and I'm already there, my shift just ending. So I go in, hang out at the front. I'm not making a huge commotion at all, just sitting next to the door doing whatever on my phone.\n\n10 minutes until her shift ends, I get in line, teas in hand.

This manager knew we were dating and didn't hide her disdain by any means, often to the point of harassing me as she couldn't harass my gf without jeopardising her job.\n\nM: I know.\n\nS: You can't use it!\n\nM: these items come up to $3.75, I'm pretty sure I can afford them without the discount. But since you seem so angry about someone other than an employee getting it, I wonder if the discount is the only way you'd be able to afford them. Now if you'll excuse me, she's off, and I want to go home. \n\nI didn't bother to look back to see her reaction but it felt good to say that after weeks of her glares.",

But - there was this grumpy elderly man directly in front of us that kept complaining and trying to get us in on his little complaint-fest.\n\nFinally came old man's time to order.

When it was done, he turned around and looked at my daughter and said, \"You better stay in school so that you don't end up like these people with a  job like this.\"  I was a tad pissed off - first, don't drag my kid into your rude-fest, and second - just, well don't.\n\nI looked at him and said, \"It's obvious they are in training and they were not rude to you at all.

Last thing I really wanted to do was make someone else spend an hour on the phone. But luckily this was an hour well spent. \n\nThe internet isn't working fast, and by fast I mean barely working at all. About .26 down. Unplug, reboot, all the standard stuff. Finally call the ISP.  I open with  \"Preloading Fallout 4 has started, apparently this really is the apocalypse because I have a 500ms ping and no downspeed) guy goes..\"I didn't know you could preload already, I guess I should go home and turn on my pc \". \n\nGo through everything I did with the guy on the phone, explained my speeds and whatnot. \n\nSo, rather than speedtest.net, he has me do the isp's own speed test. Same results. He says modem looks fine, OK no problem, let's wire direct. I grab a new cable and mention that maybe the old cable is bad, it is copper after all. Hard wire in. Same results. I unplug the modem and advise, he says... \"It's still on\". Confounded I say, no, it's definitely unplugged, lights are out. I mean, coax is plugged in but other than that totally disconnected. He mentions that he sees a netgear router attached (luckily I mentioned I has bought an Asus router and it threw up a flag to him)... Finally he says he sees the netgear go off and I plug back in. \n\nWe're confused. We talk about what ip I see vs what he sees (due to outside vs inside and if it's connected to a router vs hardwired, I guess they assign a 24 or a 72 based on what hardware they see hooked up. Anyway, what i see and he sees don't match up. I ask if he can see the Mac address, I read mine.... Nope. Serial... Nope. We confirm again were looking at the right account. Yup. He goes to ask someone else, they figure that maybe someone typed in the wrong info when they sent a replacement modem. Come to the conclusion that someone somewhere (they couldn't trace it but I assume it was in Langley, VA) was connected at the same time with the same modem info and it caused the problem. He assumes those people (if it's not the Feds) will be calling because they probably unplugged their router when he remotely shut off the modem trying to reconfigure. \n\nAlso realized my 2 months of overages (we don't use Netflix, and honestly don't use nearly 200gb a month) probably came from the mixing of the other account with mine, and he refunded me $20 bucks in overages. That's super nice since at my house the two of us have been racking our brains trying to figure out how we've gone over. Long story short back to normal speeds and no more random overages! \n\nTl;dr: Company sent me new modem awhile ago and apparently entered in the same mac as someone else. Finally came to head but an awesome tech helped sort it out in an hour and now I can preload Fallout. Thanks man! \n",

        "text": "Posting this partly because I found it funny and partly to see if there is any cultural explanation for it.\n\nA while ago I was shopping in a major UK supermarket.  At the time they used to send out coupons for specific products to loyalty card holders, based on your shopping habits (this has since been discontinued, now you just get money off any purchase).  I had a coupon for \"cooked meat\" which I wanted to use against a pack of ham, but for some reason it scanned as \"product not purchased\".  This used to happen fairly often and normally the cashier would just verify that you had bought an eligible item and manually enter the coupon.\n\nSo I showed my ham to the cashier, an Indian lady, and she sort of puffed herself up and shouted, \"ham is not meat!!!\" as if I were terminally stupid.  I was naturally a bit taken aback, but more confused about what she thought it was.  We argued it out for a couple of minutes but in the end I just completed the transaction and took the coupon to customer services.  They thought it was just as bizarre as I did.\n\nI know that a lot of Indian people are vegetarian and pork in particular is not eaten in their culture, but surely after 3 years working in a supermarket (it says on their name badges when they \"joined the team\") it's not that hard to recognise?  Can anyone explain this to me?",

Remember kiddies: Questions are a dangerous business and apparently confusing thing.  Let‚Äôs call this well-known software, ‚ÄúQuickalley‚Äù, the customer service rep ‚ÄúBee-ring‚Äù and I‚Äôll be ‚Äúreindeer flotilla.‚Äù  Here‚Äôs my exchange:\n\nDear Quickalley,\nI'm writing in regards to what I believe is a bug in your software. I'm a rather new user of your software, and have enjoyed--until recently--the product on my iMac, iPads, and iPhones. However, just recently I've had frustrating issues with Quickalley trying to install the browser package on Firefox on my iMac (OS X Yosemite 10.10.5). I have disabled this feature in my Preferences, yet Quickalley repeatedly keeps trying to install the add-on. The issue is particularly frustrating as I cannot get your software to stop trying to install the browser add-on and thus often I cannot open my password list on my iMac. I've resorted to opening Quickalley on my iPhone.\nThus, can you please suggest a resolution to this issue?\nThanks, and a have a nice day.\n\nCheers,\n\nReindeer flotilla\n\nThe next day I received this response:\n\nHello Reindeer flotilla,\nThank you for contacting us. I hope this email finds you well today. I apologize for the inconvenience.\nMy name is Bee-ring and I will be more than willing to assist you.\nOn your iMac:\nCould you please check that you're using the latest update of Quickalley?\nTo do this, select Quickalley in the menu bar and then Check for updates, or if you cannot find this menu, go to the Mac App Store if that's where you downloaded Quickalley from.\nIf it finds a new update, please install it and restart your computer to make sure it updates the Safari extension as well.\nIf the problem remains, could you please:\n1.\tOpen Safari\n2.\tSelect Safari ‚Üí Preferences in the menu bar\n3.\tSelect the Extensions panel\n4.\tSelect the Quickalley extension in the list and click Uninstall ‚Äì please refer to this page to see how to do it \nThen:\n1.\tOpen Quickalley\n2.\tSelect Quickalley ‚Üí Install browser extension ‚Üí Manage Safari extension from the menu bar\n3.\tThis will open a new page in Safari ‚Äì click here if it doesn't\n4.\tClick on Install\nPlease let me know how it goes, I need to make sure Quickalley works perfectly on your end.\nBest regards,\nBee-ring\nQuickalley Customer Support\n\n**************************************\n\nWhat?  Hmm, let me respond:\n\nHi \"Bee-ring\",\nThanks, for your prompt response, but please note:\n1). I use Firefox and not Safari,\n2). I do NOT want to use the Quickalley extension in Firefox or Safari.  I long ago deleted the extension in my add-ons in Firefox, and\n3). I am using the latest version of Quickalley available on the App \nStore\nThus, can you please support me in *disabling Quickalley from continuously trying to install the associated web browser extension in Firefox*.\nCheers,\nReindeer flotilla\n\n**************************************\n\nHi Reindeer flotilla,\nThank you for getting back to me. I appreciate your response. I apologize for the miss understanding the issue.\nOn your Firefox browser:\nCould you check your browser's extensions or add-ons menu?\nQuickalley might be there, but disabled.\nIn that case, please enable it and relaunch your browser.\nPlease refer to this guide to see how to verify your browser extension:\nHow do I enable Quickalley in my browser?\nIf the extension is already there and enabled, can you try to deactivate then reactivate the Quickalley extension and restart your browser?\nIf Quickalley still isn't working in you browser, then you may need to reinstall your browser extension. To do this, please:\n1.\tQuit your browser(s) (Firefox, Chrome or/and Safari) and open the Quickalley application.\n2.\tSelect Quickalley ‚Üí Install browser extensions in the menu bar, then select a browser in the list to manage the relevant Quickalley extension. A page should open in your browser with instructions to do so.\n3.\tNow that your browser extension has been uninstalled, open your browser(s) and check that Quickalley has been successfully removed ‚Äì this step is very important as it ensures that the extension is removed properly from all browsers and will fix most of the issues\n4.\tQuit your browser(s) again\n5.\tLastly, select Quickalley ‚Üí Install browser extensions in the menu bar and select again the browser of your choice. This time, you'll be guided to reinstalling the extension.\nIf it still does not work, could you please restart your computer and try one last time?\nIf you need any help finding the menu and reinstalling the extension, you can check this article:\nHow to check the Quickalley extension in your browser\nIf you do not want to use Quickalley auto fill and auto login feature, please follow the procedures below.\nCould you please try to disable the Automatically log me into the website option?\nIt can be found when editing a credential in the \"Passwords\" panel.\nFor more information, please refer to this guide.\nBest regards,\nBee-ring\nQuickalley Customer Support\n\n**************************************\n\nIt's at this point that I‚Äôm wondering: Is this some bot or am I in the training room for customer service reps in SE Asia?  I responded\n\nYour response is not helpful. _*I DO NOT WANT THE QUICKALLEY EXTENSION IN MY BROWSER*_. As I said, I have removed the extension long ago in Firefox, I have disabled this in Quickalley, and yet Quickalley STILL tries to install the browser extension. I have restarted my computer and I long ago disabled the Automatically log me into the website option.\n\nAgain, let me be perfectly clear: /_*I do NOT want Quickalley to keep trying to install the extension in my browsers*_/!\n\nIf you are incapable of helping me and understanding what I am requesting, then please pass my file on to someone who can better understand my needs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nReindeer flotilla\n\n**************************************\n\nThe next response was confirmation that I had somehow annoyed the internet gods, and my uncounted decendents will face an on-line life of virtual purgatory.\n\nHi Reindeer flotilla,\n\nThank you so much for your reply and for your kind words.\n\nI am sorry Quickalley for the inconvenience.\n\nTo uninstall our application, please see this guide.\n\nPlease note that Quickalley on Mac OS X needs to be uninstalled from the menu bar of the application (unless it was installed from the Mac App Store).\n\nPlease click here to see how to uninstall Quickalley from your Mac. When deleting only the Quickalley application from your Applications folder, the browser extensions and the status icon in the menu bar will still be installed on your computer.\n\nIf you have already removed Quickalley from your Mac and cannot follow the steps in the article, please run this uninstaller instead then empty the Trash and restart your computer.\n\nIf there's anything else, please do send us an email.\n\nBest regards,\n\nBee-ring\nQuickalley Customer Support\n\n**************************************\nNow‚Ä¶silence.  The horror of silence.\n\nTl;DR: I asked for some help clearing up an annoying but non-critical bug with some paid software.  I was told to siomply delete the program.\n",

        "text": "Hang on to your hats, ladies and gents, this is a long one.\n\nWe've long been reluctant customers of EvilISP mostly due to them being the only game in town with a reasonable price to performance ratio. The only other option was DSL from LocalISP and OtherEvilISP, but they wanted $$$$ for slow-as-molasses DSL.\n\nSo, EvilISP it was.\n\nBefore we had to move, we were using a rudimentary setup of a modem and some cheapo router. Crap by my nerd standards, but not bad at all, it got the job done. When we moved, however, EvilISP wanted to swap out all our cable boxes and network equipment with their new stuff. Which they did. I already had reservations about their new all-in-one gateways, because I had already helped a handful of friends diagnose their failed gateways, and the replacements weren't much better.\n\nBut I decided to give it a fair shake, and as if on cue, the problems began immediately. Download speed was good, but upstream was completely broken. 50% packet loss. EvilISP was loath to do anything. So I began doing some of my own diagnosis by moving the gateway around the house to the other cable outlets. Sure enough, the one in my room worked, and worked well! I let it be for a week before the problems came right back.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, the router portion couldn't DHCP to save its life. Computers and devices were constantly getting thrown off the network every so often for having matching IP addresses. I ended up attaching my trusty old WRT54G to the gateway to sidestep this.\n\nAfter finally getting through to someone at EISP, they decided to reset the gateway remotely and send it a new config file, because they said the config had become corrupt. Again, this helped for all of a few days before the gateway was dropping packets again on the upstream. Clearly, the upstream was busted on this gateway, but EISP was having none of it. They sent a tech out to diagnose the gateway and held fast on their statement that the gateway wouldn't be replaced, and that the problem was the house.\n\nThe tech who came out was relatively friendly and managed to find that something wasn't quite right with the cable coming up to the house. He called in a more advanced tech and told us it'd be a few days because they'd have to service the drop (where the cable comes into our house from the street). No problem, sir! I was just happy to have some sort of closure to this, and be told the problem was something relatively simple. After the advanced tech came out, everything was fine and working great. The end.\n\n...or so I thought.\n\nIt lasted about a month, which is good compared to where we were at.\n\nThat's when EISP decided to be totally generous and double the region's internet speeds. So instead of 30Mbps, we were now pulling 60. Pretty awesome, right? Would have been, if this change hadn't broken the gateway again. As I was out of town, my girlfriend handled this one, and got them to send a tech out to the house. The gateway was still in my room, as the previous tech agreed that it performed the best there. I made sure to move everything before I left as to give the tech easy access to the gateway and wiring.\n\nAs I'm on my way back home, I get a call from the girlfriend, who explains that the tech lectured her and yelled at her because the gateway was moved from the living room, and said he should be charging us for this work because the gateway was moved from its original location (with EISP's blessing, no less) which voids any sort of warranty it had. He moved it back to the living room, and promptly left, telling my girlfriend that if anything goes wrong, to wait 2 weeks before calling again.\n\nSurprising no one, I took a speed test and ping test and the packet loss was as bad as ever. I was livid. Beyond livid. So I got the contact info for one of EISPs higher-ups, and wrote a long and scathing letter to them and told them to basically get their crap together and fix the damn problem, or I'd have no qualms overpaying LocalISP for their crappy DSL but vastly better customer service. I told them I wanted a dedicated modem to which I can use my own router, and to take their crappy gateway and to keep it the hell away from my house.\n\nThey responded, saying they'd have an expert tech at my house within 24 hours and he'd have a dedicated modem with him. They tried to scare me out of it, saying that swapping the gateway could adversely affect our TV service, to which I called their BS and said that the cable boxes use their own independent connections to the internet and the gateway has no bearing on that; just send a damn modem and stop wasting my time.\n\nThe expert tech arrived the next day, and he was a lot better than the previous techs. Did everything exactly right. Tested all the lines, even swapped out all of our coax cables for freshly minted ones just to make sure that wouldn't be a problem. Installed the modem just fine, and I stuck the trusty old WRT54G on it.\n\nAnd finally, *finally*, that was it. The new modem has been flawless. I ended up swapping it out later down the line to save on the rental fees, but ever since ridding ourselves of that crappy, sub-par all in one gateway, our internet has been rock solid.",

        "text": "I have lots of eye problems, due to being diabetic.  Soon after my husband died, I decided to make an appointment to see an eye specialist.  They determined that not only did I have some eye issues, but I was legally blind in one eye (200/20 is legally blind), but my other eye just needed a \"little\" work to prevent it from going bad (60/20 vision).\n\nSo I had one laser surgery, right there in the office, and found that the surgeon liked to have you look for the lit tip of his finger.  Didn't really work for me, and the process was pretty difficult to complete.\n\nHe wanted to go through the same laser process with my other eye, the blind one.  This time, I requested he give me different verbal instructions, left, right, up, down, that kind.  He followed through, and the process was much smoother than the first time.  He only did half the work he wanted done on the eye, so I was going to have to come back once more for further work.\n\nSo I come back the next week, prepared to follow the same process.  I reminded the surgeon of the type of verbal instructions that worked best.  This time, about halfway through the process, I had the other eye closed.  This was normal for me, it allowed me to concentrate on the surgeons instructions, and not worry about getting feedback from the other eye.  However, the surgeon decided he wanted me to look at the lit tip of his finger again, disregarding the method of giving instructions that worked best for me.  He told me to use the other eye (which was closed) to look for the fingertip, and that my sight was perfectly fine for this.  He even mentioned that I had 60/20 vision, so there was no excuse for me to not locate his fingertip.  It was dark, and turned out that the fingertip was out of my field of vision.  I had to turn my head to find it, and all of that could have been avoided if he had told me to look straight with the eye that was being operated on.  I did find the fingertip, but his tone of voice (he sounded like he was berating me for not following his instructions), and the fact that my sight was only 60/20 when wearing glasses (I'm legally blind in that eye as well without glasses), it was upsetting to have a surgeon disregard my requests and berate me in the middle of any operation, especially when dealing with the eyes.\n\nWas I in the wrong for being upset over the third operation?  I mean, he said that I should have been able to see just fine, because of a level of vision that was only possible with glasses.  He disregarded my request (although he did remember to tell me verbal directions for the rest of the procedure that day), and acted miffed that it took me a \"long\" time to get my other eye to adjust to the low level of light and look for his fingertip.  I did later talk to him about it, but it was a very frustrating process for me to go through.  I ended up filing a complaint with my insurance, because I didn't want this type of issue happening to someone else.  Another thing that I found odd was that none of his offices offered any large print documents, in a business where they are dealing with near blind and blind patients.  With me, I ended up tossing quite a bit of paperwork away, because there was no way I could read them, the print was too small.  It was stuff I eventually looked online for more details, because I could adjust the font and size to better suite me (although ads and sidebars do get in the way...).\n\nTL:DR:  My eye surgeon decided that my request for verbal directions was too difficult to remember during an eye procedure.  Then berated me for not having the other eye open, and expected that eye (which is blind without glasses) to work as well as it does with glasses.  The environment was dark, and it took a long time for that eye to adjust.  Surgeon went back to verbal directions for the remainder of the process, but I was already upset over his expectations and lack of courtesy/professionalism.",

We waited at the bar for 15 minutes before being shown to our table and introduced to a portly gentleman who would be our waiter. The time was now 7.15pm. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \n25 minutes passed, both our drinks where empty when our server returned to take our order. No big deal I think. It is the dinner time rush. I pointed this out to my girlfriend, who was a retail manager for 3 years, a Retail employee for the best part of 10. She knows service and management. She has an eagle eye for good and bad service.  She notes that people who sat in the other area behind us had already been served. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\na half hour after being seated we got served. 20 minutes later the food arrived, 2 of the 4 plates where incorrect. Two other couples had been placed on tables either side of us in the mean time. We finished our food but I was left to look at my empty plate for 45 minutes before our server decided to clear the table. Other tables either side of us had been served, eaten and had there food cleared away in the same time it took for our server to clear away while i was still looking at my empty plate. We had tried to get our servers attention 4 times and even asked 2 other staff members to go get him in that time.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe declined desert and paid. We did not leave a tip. Tipping is optional in the UK and after being stuck in a restaurant the best part of an hour and a half for one course I didn't feel it was deserved. On the way out my girlfriend stopped by the front of house to talk to the manager. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe manager seemed unphased by our complaint and asked us to step outside into the smoking area to talk about it more, he apologised and offered us money off our  next bill. We said we already paid and where not looking for any special treatment, we just felt somebody should be told so it does not happen to other people. The manager changed his tone a bit after hearing this and was actually able to describe our server to us and said we were the 5th people to complain that week. We felt a bit bad for the guy, it just seemed he was not cut out for working in a restaurant. We gave the manager the facts and left. \n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe went back over the weekend to eat there again and saw the manager. He informed us that our previous server was let go at the end of that shift. He told it us was not purely down to our feedback but  I still feel rather guilty about it really. \n  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL-DR: Received bad service, complained. Server got fired. ",

        "text": "So there's this little problem that can happen when shopping at a convention or a festival.\n\nThe vendors/dealers are from different states. Their credit/debit machines are, of course, also from different states. Their accounts are from different states.\n\nSo sometimes you run a risk: Using your card at multiple vendors can (stupidly) put a flag on your account. There's no way someone would ever steal your card and use it in california, then new york, then florida, but your bank will freak out and assume that it was stolen, and lock it.\n\nThis happened to me.\n\nI was trying to make a large purchase and my card was declined. Thankfully a friend footed the bill, but my card was locked. The vendor explained their account was in California. This happened to that same friend before, so we were experienced with the problem. When she tried to pay, she actually got declined too, but her bank sent a text immediately allowing her to verify and allow the purchase.\n\nI spent about 25 minutes trying to get my card unlocked. I couldn't get anything but a robot asking for my account number that I obviously don't have lying around or memorized. Eventually by mashing 0 for all the robot options I got a person.\n\n**The vendor had tried to charge me 10x the cost of the item, almost 1,000 dollars.**\n\nThe card wasn't locked because she was from california, it was because there was a sudden massive purchase *following* smaller purchases out of town.\n\nAfter finally getting htings fixed I went to inform the vendor of her mistake and she simply said \"Oh, I know, but I tried to cancel it after I scanned the card.\".\n\nShe friggin' knew all along that she charged me 10x the price by mistake (misplaced decimal point) and didn't tell me that initially. Like I'd never figure out! What the heck!",

        "text": "Hello y'all! Yet another tale of bad customer service.\n\nRecently one of our car's tires blew-up and we needed to replace them all ASAP because they were all in poor condition. We searched for nice tires online and for a place that had them readily available and that was the VitalGuys autoshop. We ordered the tires online and it said that they were available today so we made an appointment to get them installed and aligned.\n\nWe get to our appointment on our spare tire, go inside the store and a bald guy with a significant beard tends to us. We give him our printed confirmation, he goes to the back and tells us that they don't have them and that he was going to order them so they could get them for us. He apologizes, says that he'll try to have them for us soon, he explains that the website doesn't work and yadda yadda. \n\nI was livid so I called corporate and they were fantastic and told us that the best they could do is order the tires as well. I thanked them profusely but told them that the bearded dude at the store had already offered that for us and we accepted, but I also let him know about my discontent with the online//physical-store snafu. \n\nThey VitalGuys call us the next day telling us that the tires are there and we can come anytime. We go there immediately, get to the counter and the give us the order papers while we wait. In the comments of that order, [this is what I see.](http://i.imgur.com/jXxNru4.jpg)\n\nThe tires were there all along and this guy just bullshitted us and lied to our face to not install them later in the evening. I understand that it might be tedious, but he could've at least said \"Hey, installing them takes a little while and both of us will be here a couple of hours, would you mind coming tomorrow early?\" or he could've called us earlier telling us that they don't install tires after 5:00p.m. or something similar and we would've accepted. But no, he lied to our faces and made us waste time and be worried and wonder if we would be able to do without new tires and with just a spare. \n\nThe cherry on top is that when they were installing the tires, he came to us and said:\n\n&gt; \"I was able to pull some strings and get them here early for y'all.\"\n\nYou sure did, buddy. You sure did. We called corporate again to set a complaint and according to the lady on the phone, they will call us back this Saturday. Let's see how that goes. \n\n#UPDATE\n\nWe got a call back from the General Manager. He explained the situation with *wheels* and the online ordering system and I let him explain. After he kindly told me about the system's issues, I let him know we ordered tires. He immediately asked me if they were the WhiteTireBoy Brand and if they were four and I said yes. I went onto telling him about the bearded dude (who happens to be assistant manager) lying to us, the invoice and his \"I was able to pull some strings\" shit and he was not happy. He agreed that his employees should be straightforward and not cover things in smoke and mirrors and told us to come on Monday, that he would take care of us. Happy!",

I find the things that I want and head up to the counter. \n\nMy cashier was BRAND NEW (she even had the \"I'm new here\") ribbon on her name tag, but she had a great trainer right by her side. The trainer was like, \"Ok, this is so-and-so, she's new here, but I'll be right here with her.\"\n\nShe did a great job, and only tripped up a couple of times and that was because I asked that my purchases be sent back to my hotel so I didn't have to schlep them around the park that day. \n\nI was like, \"This is great! I was able to ride X and X and I still have time before my reservation for my next ride!\" \n\nHer trainer wanted to hurry her along, but I didn't mind that it took a little longer. I asked her how long she had been there, and that day was her third day. \n\nBless her heart. \n",

        "text": "Two nights ago I was in mr big box retail super store with my girlfriend shopping for some groceries and picking up a few things.  \n\nIt was very late at night, and this particular location is one of a few in the area that are part of a new policy of closing for 6 hours in the middle of the night.\n\nIt was an hour till closing when we realized they only had one register open, okay, normal at night I guess, just wait a few extra minutes in line.  \n\nAs the cashier is checking us out, she picks up my only item and scans it in my girlfriends items. We wouldn't have been put off by this, but the items were VERY personal, and I had my hand, literally on top of the box of items, dividing it from my girlfriends stuff.  The cashier had to literally reach around my arm to snatch the item up in order to scan it, while there was still some of my girlfriend's products waiting to be scanned. When we did tell her about her mistake, she made an apologetic sound, but gave us some weird looks.\n\nAfter she finishes scanning my girlfriends items and gets her rung up, she immediate scans my 1 item and starts asking for my payment.  Because the item is intimate in nature she quickly stuffs it in a bag.  This is important because this retailer has the carousels with 6 bagging spots on it, that turns as the cashier scans and bags the items. So what's important to notice is that she scanned, turned the carousel one turn, and bagged my item.\n\nSo I paid, my girlfriend grabbed her stuff and threw it in the cart, I grabbed my bag and did the same.\n\nWe lived about 5 minutes away, so we get home and almost immediately notice we are short a bag.  \n\nMy girlfriend had 3 bags total.  2 for grocery items, 1 for non groceries, specifically deodorant, a box of bandaids, and a pumpkin carving kit.  The bag we were missing was the last bag.\n\nSo we drive back.\n\nAt this point I want to mention that the location we went to both times is not in the best part of town, and draws a lot of low lifes, especially at night.  My girlfriend and I are both young, but compared to the usual riff raff that tends to frequent this store in this particular part of our city, we might as well be wearing wedding attired.\n\nWhen we get back to the store, we go inside, someone informs us that they are closing soon, and we tell them we came back because we are missing a bag.  He directs us to the customer service manager.\n\nWe meet this woman fairly close to the checkout stand we used, and explain what happened and show her our receipt, she checks behind the counter and doesn't see any bags left behind, and begins to basically give us the run around of why she can't help us.  This is where it gets frustrating.\n\nIn the 5 minutes that we are standing in the store talking to this lady a few extremely demeaning and downright unacceptable things happened:\n\n1. She almost immediately insinuates that we are trying to scam the store.  - Yeah lady we need 2 boxes of 100 bandaids, 2 sticks of 1.50 deodorant, and 2 pumpkin carving kits.\n\n2.  Another employee comes over and interrupts us to ask about her break.  She actually interrupts the customer service manager, who is talking to a CUSTOMER to ask when she could take her 2nd break.  The manager is obviously irritated with this, but doesn't do anything about it.\n\n3.  Basically tells us we are shit outta luck.  Once its bagged its our problem.  FINE LADY I FUCKING GET IT.  But for fucks sake do you need to treat us like we are shit mongering thieves trying to rob you guys for the scabs from your anal hemorrhoids?\n\nAs this all is happening I decide that maybe I can find the cart we used and double check it, I jog outside, the cart is nowhere to be found, and as I head back my girlfriend is on her way out.\n\nShe's pissed, I'm pissed, we both feel screwed over, and this lady did not give us the time of day, nonetheless treat us like customers.\n\nSo we leave.  We basically got told we screwed up, our loss.  \n\nAnd yet, honestly, it feels more like they robbed us. \n\nSo thank you mr retail giant, you know who you are.\n\nYou will not get the chance to fool me twice.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention why the whole issue over how she bagged our items was so important. I was able to figure this out after we left the second time. Basically what we think happened is that since each of the three sides on the bag carousel has two spots for bags, she placed the stuff we lost in the left side of the first face of the carousel(the side closest to her), turned it, and then filled the other two sides of the second face with the rest of our groceries while my girlfriend was paying. Then before my girlfriend could get her first bag, the cashier must have rang up my one item, turned the carousel one last time, moving my girlfriends bag to the back, and dumped my item in the left bag on the third face. So when the next customer came in they probably on had one bags worth of items, and the cashier didn't notice our stuff before she turned the carousel for them to get their stuff.",

I had a shopping cart full of stuff, since I almost never shop retail, do most online, and I had spent the gas getting there. So I was loading up my cart!\n\n2 cashiers were on. The first was very polite and nice to everyone (I noticed, since there was a 9 minute line). The second was snarky. The first kept asking each customer, \"would you like to apply for a credit card today? 20% off this purchase?\"\n\nI was psyched, thinking if I applied, I could get a discount to add to my total, and use my gift card. I got up to the register with snarly woman. She barely said hi.\n\n\"Aren't you going to try to sign me up for a charge card?\" I asked her.\n\nShe LITERALLY ROLLED HER EYES. \n\n\"You're using a gift card,\" she said. \"Why would I sign you up?\"\n\nThe gift card was for a mere 25.00. My cart had at least 150.00 of stuff in it. But she had no idea how much was left on the gift card. \n\nI took out almost exactly 25.00 worth of stuff and bought it. Left the rest behind. I said, \"I thought you were offering discounts to new card holders. Guess not.\"",

The only instructions were: Blue blouse, under [X]'s name, ordered. Don't worry, they know me from yesterday.\n\nI spent half an hour finding the store, another half hour talking to staff. They had no records of a purchase registered under the phone numbers (plural!) that I gave, nor names, nor could they manually find the top in question.\n\nThere was something of a panic going on because it was assumed that I hadn't made a mistake, so the counter lady was calling up other stores in the area to check if they'd registered the purchase elsewhere.\n\nAfter that half hour X called me to tell me it was in fact, a skirt. She'd misspoken.\n\nTen minutes later. No skirt either.\n\nI call X. Oh. Not a purchase. How embarrassing! I tell the lady it was a repair job. The item is found in under a minute.\n\nOf course, wallowing as I was in the embarrassment of having initiated such a panic for no reason, the universe decided to rub salt into the wound when I tried to leave with the item and was told X hadn't paid for it yet.\n\nOops! Paid that, then stood there at the counter waiting for another five minutes with a bag that I had requested from them (free of charge!).\nThe staff began laughing and told me that it hadn't even been repaired yet, so I returned the bag (I'd asked for it thinking I was taking the item back) and finished making a fool of myself. :D\n\nThat day was a grave defeat for dignity.",

        "text": "Just discovered this subreddit and wanted to talk about my \"wonderful\" experience with Nameless airlines last May.\n\n\nNormally I never have issues with Nameless, I've flown with them internationally and I've never had problems. However last May I had to fly from Orlando to Minneapolis and it was 3 very unpleasant hours.\n\n\nI was sitting comfortably in my window seat of a Boeing 747 with my earbuds in my ears and my mind elsewhere, with an open seat between me and the woman on the end. We were getting close to takeoff so I thought maaaaybe I would be lucky and could stretch out my legs, I was wrong.\n\n\nI'm not paying attention when I hear a flight attendant asking the woman on the end if she would move so \"some people could sit together.\" I think \"well there goes my dreams of no one in the middle seat\" and sigh. But then I have a thought, and it's an unpleasant thought. I turn to look and see the frazzled flight attendant moving the woman next to me and taking her down to where she will have to sit and coming back and I could just tell from his face what he was about to do and I was NOT happy. He comes up to me and says:\n\n\n\"Would you be willing to move so 2 parents and a kid can sit here?\"\n\n\nNow I'm not a douche by any means but I had a long day, so I just look at him for a moment while he sweats and finally just sigh and say \"Fine.\"\n\n\nSo I move and wouldn't you know it, I get stuck in a middle seat. Now I hate middle seats (I feel most people do) but what made it worse was the woman sitting in the aisle seat next to me. She SMELLED. Now I don't just mean smelled, I mean SMELLED to high heaven and back. I resisted the urge to gag but knew I probably wasn't going to get out of this. Any time I saw the flight attendant I glared at him.\n\n\nSo the flight goes up and its drink time and I'm trying to distract myself from the smell of the woman next to me as best I can and pray time moves faster when flight attendant comes to me and offers to bring me something from the menu for free. This makes me feel slightly more like a human being and I tell him just bring me what's good and the flight attendant actually brings me both a snack box and a meal box. I'm happy because this would have cost me $20 and he appeared honestly apologetic that he had to have me move and was trying to make up for it. He gave me a full can of coke too. I however had no appetite because of the smell, so I just hold onto them for when I get off this smelly cramped hell.\n\n\nThen about an hour before we are going to land, smelly woman gets up to use the bathroom and out of my mouth pops an \"Oh my God finally!\" and the woman next to the window who I hadn't been paying attention to looks at me and says \"Did you smell it too?\" and we both laugh. So we get to chatting and I spent my last hour chatting with her to distract myself.\n\n\nWas $20 of Nameless' healthy food worth 3 hours of smelly hell? Probably not, but at the time the fact that the flight attendant offered to feed me for free when I was unhappy made it suck less. Sometimes trying to do the right thing (like keeping a family together) means making others (me) unhappy, but the fact that the flight attendant seemed to care about the fact he had to move me made me feel like a valued customer, and I was grateful for it.",

        "text": "Hello, all! First TalesFrom-- poster here! :)\n\n\nThis took place where I work, but I can assure you, this occurred AFTER my shift, and I really was a customer. I need to explain a few things first. \n\n\nThe State Fair where I live is winding down this weekend. I work there as a temporary employee. I work in the Arts &amp; Crafts Department. We have a few vendors in our building with us, but I'm part of the main focus. I'm a fair employee, not a vendor. That distinction is very important. \n\n\nAll State Fair employees and vendors wear a lanyard. Depending on what you do, you have certain tags on them. EVERYONE gets a gold tag with the State Fair's logo, an ID number, and the words \"2015 worker\" on them. People who work in departments, though, get another tag. This one is white, and typically has \"STATE FAIR [department] STAFF\" written on it. I wear both gold and white tags, and both are plainly visible on me.\n\n\nNow, the booth next door (it's actually attached to my building) sells ice cream made from the state university's agriculture department. It's not uncommon for the lines to have a 20 minute wait. Their ice cream is that good. \n\n\nAnyway, there's a secret window in the back of the booth where you can bypass the line and if you're lucky get a discount if you meet certain qualifications. I'll get to those in a bit.\n\n\nNow, a little about me: I'm a pacifist, and I *hate* confrontation, especially with a stranger. Also, I have trouble explaining my thoughts and feelings. I can't seem to tell others what I'm feeling inside. These two details are necessary to understand the story. \n\n\nSpeaking of, onwards! I'll be Me and the guy I spoke to will be Window Dude. \n\n\nYesterday, after my shift, I wanted ice cream from next door. I've been able to bypass the line using the Secret Back Window before, so I had no qualms about using that line. \n\n\n&gt;WD: Hello! What can I get ya?\n\n\n&gt;Me: Hiya! I'd like your [signature ice cream] please!\n\n\n&gt;WD: Are you one of these? \n\n\nHe points to a sign next to the window, which stated that only police officers, firefighters, paramedics and other emergency workers, and fair staff could use the back window. At the bottom was a highlighted \"NO VENDORS OR GENERAL FAIRGOERS ALLOWED\"\n\n\n&gt;Me: *holds up lanyard, showing off my white tag*\n\n\n&gt;WD: I'm sorry, but you need to either be a Uni student, an officer, or fair staff to use this window. \n\n\n&gt;Me: Uh...*internal emotion: Does he mean permanent fair workers? But I could use this window before...*\n\n\n&gt;*Actually said:* But I...*points vaguely at the Arts &amp; Crafts building*\n\n\n&gt;WD: *nodding sympathetically* I know, but you're not allowed to use this window. You'll have to use the public line. I'm sorry. \n\n\n&gt;Me, internally: Screw it. \n\n\n&gt;Me: Okay. Bye. \n\n\nI did not use the public line. I got cookies instead from across the street. And they were scrumptious. \n\n\nBut that's not the best part. Earlier today, three of my coworkers went to get ice cream from them, using the Secret Back Window. \n\n\nAll three returned shortly with ice cream. They even got a discount. T_T\n\n\nI know I could have handled the situation a lot better, but after being told no multiple times (When I *knew* I qualified to use the Secret Back Window) I was getting annoyed, and just wanted to leave. Ah well. Live and learn, right?\n\n\nThanks for listening.",

We waited for seating, and got offered a booth in the bar, so we decided to take it. Drink orders taken, menus out, things are fine. We get one shot to order, and I guess we should have taken it. Half of us being new, we didn't have a clue as to what we wanted, so we asked for another minute. That extra moment ended up turning into 20. We never did see our waitress through most of that, though a man refilling drinks came by 15 minutes in, and we told him our problem and he shrugged it off. We decide that there's no sense in waiting for our missing waitress, leave money on the table for our drinks and leave. We take note upon our departure, though, of our waitress in the bar, which is fairly empty. How lovely. We think one of the others had an \"Oh shit\" moment when they saw us walking out. Is sitting in the bar asking to be forgotten about?",

        "text": "A few years ago my brother in law and I went to a local sandwich shop.  The way this shop is set up is a little confusing.  First, you pick up a paper sandwich bag that has little boxes where you check what you want and also a place for you to write your name.  Then you pay for your order and hand the bag to the manager (because he is the first in the assembly line) and he takes your money.  The next guy puts the meat on the sandwich.  He hands it off to an employee who puts all of the vegetables on it, then he hands it to the last employee who bags it up with your chips and calls your name over the loudspeaker.  I noticed this process while I was filling out my bag and I wondered if I could slip a funny name past them.  You guessed it, I wrote \"Boner\" on my bag. \n\nAs I handed the bag to the manager I watched him as I walked back to my table to see if he noticed.  Nope.  Phase one complete.  Guy two began to put the lettuce and olives and other toppings on my sandwhich and he never noticed.  Almost home.  The funny part is when it get to guy three.  This guy has been calling out name after name after name for probably 3 hours straight and you can tell that he would rather be anywhere but doing this at this moment.  To say he was bored would have been the understatement of the year.  Now he has my bag in his hand.  He has a decision to make.  Does it call his manager over to double check it or does he yell my name out?  He chose the latter.  I watched as he looked at my name and almost began to speak into the microphone.  He paused and looked at my bag as though he wanted to make sure his brain wasn't playing tricks on him and it actually said \"brian\" or something.  Then with a half smile he looked back at his manager who was busy taking the next guy's money and beginning to make his sandwich.  Suddenly he realized this wasn't a joke and that this funny name had slipped past his manager and if he yelled this into the microphone he would only be doing his job.  With a happiness I can only compare to getting a $10 an hour raise, he lifts the microphone and with excitement and authority in his voice he yells, \"BONER!!!\" into the loudspeaker.  The entire restaurant stopped doing what they were doing and looked straight at him while he was grinning ear to ear.  Next, they all turned and looked at me as I was the only person walking up to the counter to get BONER's sandwich.  I tried not to laugh, but when I made eye contact with the employee the entire circus of events played back in my head and I freaking lost it.  I laughed harder than I had laughed in a long time.  So did he.  And so did the manager.  The manager said something like, \"I'm usually good at catching things like that.\" and we all had a good laugh about it.  ",

        "text": "Hi all! Found this place from /r/TalesFromRetail and wanted to share this local company's policy. I'm from Hong Kong and out here, companies have rather interesting ways of approaching service. I refer to the company as AnonyCo throughout.\n\nAround 1,000 of the 4,000-5,000 yearly complaints to the HK Consumer Council refer directly to this wondrous company.\n\nShall we delve into the horror that is AnonyCo?\n\nNumber 1: No broadband.\n\nAnonyCo is actually a monopoly. Has been for several years and is allowed to operate under this manner. It isn't uncommon for those in Lantau or New Territories to be told that it would be difficult to install broadband cables or other forms of internet service. \"Not our problem.\" \n\nLantau is the very island that receives the internet cables (the big ones that connect to international routing stations). \n\nAnonyCo is responsible (through its carrier licence) for installing and managing broadband cables but they are well known for not bothering. A 'broadband' cable here (for residents) can be as high as the staggering 300kb/s speeds (and that's off-peak, on-peak you might be lucky to get 70 kb/s).\n\n\nNumber 2: The property you live at doesn't exist.\n\nAnother frequent problem with properties under 40 years old. Some of these structures aren't in their records. If they aren't in their records, you don't exist! AnonyCo has to send out a LocationTeam^TM . This can take up to two weeks to organise. Until such time, AnonyCo will not take further action.\n\nNumber 3: Self-perpetuating contracts. \n\nAnonyCo operates with auto-renewal contracts (landline, television, internet). This means that if your contract expires, it is automatically renewed and you are charged. They do not ever cancel contracts unless they have received the correct forms. \n\nUsing their relocation service actually counts as setting up a new contract and doesn't automatically cancel the prior contract (at the old location if you moved house). This all brings me to:\n\nNumber 4: The methodology of cancelling contracts.\n\nIn order to cancel a service at AnonyCo you must call their hotline and navigate yourself to sales service. You must then ask for sales service to *fax* you the Subscription Cancellation Form^TM . This cannot be emailed or mailed to you. It must be faxed.\n\nYou must then fax it back. For companies, no big deal. For a lot of residents, fax machines are not exactly household equipment.\n\nNumber 5: Parallel Dimensions (or Left and Right hands are unaware of each other).\n\nIf you have moved property recently, there is a very high chance that AnonyCo will have processed this in Relocations but not share this information with Technical Services. Often, any request for help will have an engineer sent to your old address until you fill out a Change Of Address Form. \n\nYou have to fax that one too.\n\nNumber 6: Cell phone reception and service.\n\nIf you have a cell-phone contract with AnonyCo you will discover that their SMS service is... well, unreliable at best. Coverage repeatedly fails. You may not cancel your contract because of this though. AnonyCo insists that they provide their service as a 'Best Efforts' service. Full service, despite Hong Kong's tiny size is not guaranteed.\n\nNumber 7: AnonyCo believes in a 3 strikes policy.\n\nRegarding cell-phones, you may only successfully cancel early if a minimum of three complaints have been made within a specified time period (you will still need to pay an early cancellation fee). The time period is usually a month. \n\nNumber 8: Hilary got nothing on this.\n\nFrom personal experience and reported in newspapers. AnonyCo will often dispute with you regarding service issues verbally. However, more often than not, after requesting to receive a subscription termination form, all contact from them is stopped. (Remember the rule about 3 complaints?). The emails you were exchanging? 'Oops. We have no internal records.' Always save email chains when dealing with AnonyCo. Even after sending an email requesting that form, you will still be charged for service that you intended to cancel.\n\nNumber 9: Debt Collectors.\n\nNo. Not repo-men. We're talking aggressive debt collection agencies. A lot of customers frustrated with AnonyCo will stop paying them. AnonyCo's response is to send debt collectors at all hours in the night to your registered address to demand payment. We're talking men in vans knocking on your door at 10pm at night, something illegal under HK law.\n\n\nThat's all!\n\nI eagerly await the introduction of EU/US style consumer protection laws. :D\n\n\n\n\n",

That day I had plans but became privy to a sale on Galaxy S6 phones where a 64Gb version was cheaper then the 32Gb, great deal right?\n\nAnyway I had also gotten a router that didn't work in the end and made the trip back to the store because it was a $400 router and exchanged it for a $200 and spent the rest of the store credit on various Playstation games and a $50 PSN card.\n\nSo last Sunday I scratch it and sadly have the misfortune of an irredeemable code which needs Sony's attention and they requested a copy of the PSN card. Today they also requested a Proof of Purchase. Five days after I submitted the email. Great, already in great service mode.\n\nSo I contact the Big Box Electronics Retailer (One I have worked for) to get them to email me a copy of my invoice with the PSN card. \n\nTheir options are \n\nGo into the Store 2 hours away\nGo to another store \nWrite a letter and we will mail it to you. \n\n\"No one has email\" (the managers do and the store has a generic one)\n\nAnd they can't anyway because they claim it would violate privacy laws to send me, my own information. \n\nStaff were unable to state what privacy laws it would break. Mostly because there are none covering personal information of this nature. \n\nWorking harder for this $50 then I do at my real job which has me on the verge of writing it off &gt;&lt;;\n\n",

Having found the wood that would fit my purposes I looked around for someone to cut it for me.  Having no luck I made my way to the front of the store and asked a cashier to call someone.   She did an then announced over the pa system.   I made my way back to the wood cutting area.   I proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait.   After about 20 minutes I went in search of another associate.  Once again we repeat over the Pa.  Ten minutes later no help.  I'm frustrated at this point after wasting half an hour on what should have taken 5 minutes.   I set off looking again. \n\nAfter hunting down another person he calls over the PA system and walky talky.  I return and begin browsing reddit.   After reaching page six I realize it has been about 25 minutes. At this point I am starting to get angry.    I decided I was done and began exiting the store.   As I walked past the original cashier she asked where my wood was and I informed her that after waiting for almost an hour no one ever came and now I needed to leave to pick up my kids. \n\nShe then flipped on her blinking light and called for a manager.   Before I could even make it to the door two managers showed up.   She called for me to wait and both managers began apologizing and walked back and cut my lumber together.   \n\nOnce I left I realized I needed a half gallon of milk for dinner so I quickly stopped at the grocery store.   I quickly grabbed one and started speed walking to the front.   Seeing me rushing up the isle the csm asked if I was in a hurry.   I replied that I was and that is when I saw the lines.  \n\nSighing in defeat I realized that I didn't have time to check out.  Seeing my frustration the csm said that she didn't have any registers available to open so she said just take it and she would pay for it.   I couldn't believe how nice she was.   So I ran with my milk, picked up my kids and returned to the store.   I bought the girl a 10 dollar gift card and left a message saying thank you.   \n\nIt's amazing the difference in service in one day.",

I've seen him stocking the shelves before. How could you know that he doesn't work here? You guys have hundreds of employees you can't keep track of them all yada yada yada.\n\nI just keep walking out and hear a very loud crash. Out of shear morbid curiosity I turn around and peek back in and she had shoved over her shopping cart. I high tailed it out of there without looking back.\n\nEdit: Typos",

I'm still shaking a bit, and the story is a bit complicated, but I'm looking for advice, so if you can make it through, then thanks. \n\nI signed up with a big name cable/internet company to come hook up my new apartment this week. They offered me a great deal at $87 for installation and first months rent. When I received the automated message confirming my appointment, it said a payment of $127 would be necessary. So I called them back, the guy said they didn't update the system properly, and it should show now. Great. I receive the automated message again, and it says $127. I call back, a different guy said that the previous guy should have updated a different part of the work order. Whatever. Finally, on the third try, my automated message said $87. Cool. \n\n\nThe day of installation arrives. They said a technician would call me an hour before their arrival which was scheduled from 4-5 pm. I never received a phone call, so I called them at 5pm. They said a technician called me three times at 3pm. That was not true! So they said they could send someone out between 5-7 pm. Fine. \n\nI get home at 5:05 pm, and ten minutes later, a guy knocks on my door. He said \"you need Internet set up?\" I said yeah, and without thinking, I let him in. I noticed he did not have the name of the company on his shirt. He looked at the hookup for a second, then said he needed to go to his truck for supplies. \n\nHe spent about ten minutes at his truck (which was parked outside my window; I checked and there was no name of the company on the truck either). When he came back, he was talking loudly on speakerphone to a friend in Spanish. \n\nI texted my SO and explained the situation. He called the big company while the technician was in my apartment. My SO asked for his technician number. I gave it to him and it didn't match the information he was told. The big company also told him that no one should come out there without big name company identification. \n\nBy this time, my apartment manager had shown up. (My SO called her first before the big company because he knew I was home alone). When she showed up I told the technician that I was uncomfortable with him being there, for security reasons, I told him I would reschedule. He immediately became defensive and said I was wasting his time and that he should have told me this before. He refused to leave without calling his company first. After a few awkward minutes of his rudeness and my uncomfortableness, he left. He gave a few choice words to my apartment manager in the parking lot. \n\n\nThe big company called me almost immediately, stating that the technician was who he said he was. I told them that they should carry identification, and that regardless, his demeanor was uncalled for. The guy pretty much offered nothing else but defense of the technician. \n\nMy SO called the big company back and they assured the technician would be written up and they offered a discount. \nNow I'm worried because he has been inside my apartment and has my address. \n\nAny advice is welcomed.

A month later, long and behold, I get a bill for the internet from \"H\"ell. I didn't use any internet as I was already with a competing ISP. I go on live web chat, explain my problem, get transferred, explain my problem, get told I have to phone their retention department. At this point, I was pretty frustrated having wasted an hour on the web chatting with a rep only to find out that no one could help me and I had to call....could have told me sooner? So I call, get my service cancelled for good this time, then have to argue about the charges. Why should I be billed for services not used at all? Talk to a level above the rep, able to get my money back but only to discover that it will take 8 weeks.....by mail.....and they expect their modem back in 4 weeks. WTF how is that even fair? You take my money, and hold it back 8 weeks, yet you want your equipment back in 4 weeks. And if I don't give it back I'll be charged $99 for a POS modem. I argue why I have to wait 8 weeks for money that is owed to me and they only have to wait 4 only to be told it's \"Policy\". I've worked retail myself, but holy are people incompetent at their jobs for this whole chain of events to transpire. Zero accountability, zero competence, zero logical \"policies\". You sure are eager to take my money instantly from my credit card, but when its owed to me, it takes 8 weeks, by mail, as a check. \n\nI hate them.\n",

        "text": "Rather than take public transport I choose to go to University and back 4 days a week. This is giving the company around ¬£80 a day so you'd think that they'd try and ensure that they kept this customer happy.\n\nAfter finishing at 5:30 this Friday I left uni and walked out and went to tescos to buy a snack. I booked the taxi for 5:45 so i had plenty of time. After I bought it I went and sat outside waiting. It was 5:55 and no signs of the taxi. I think that they are just being crappy again and go inside instead of waiting out in the cold. Now it's 6:10 and nothing so I text my mum about how the Taxi was going to be late because the taxi hasn't come yet. 10 minutes later I get a call from my mum and she went and called up the taxi company to ask them what is happening with her sons taxi. They don't always respond to my email saying that they've booked it even when they had so I maybe thought they didn't book it. She said when she called up they told her that it was canceled. The only people who should be able to do that is me and her and she didn't call them up and I didn't call them up. Rather then accepting that they mucked up they told her \"Well obviously someone canceled it\" in a hateful tone. Then he told her they could send a taxi but it'd take 45 minutes. She responded with a hang up.\n\nI've called up the taxi company only once (booked through email other times) and I was responded with a condescending tone like I'm an absolute mug. How these people get away with responding to first time callers with such a disgusting attitude I don't know. I'm currently in the process of searching for another company to take my business elsewhere. I've never tried Uber but I don't know how a company can be confused how they are loosing customers when they treat them like crap for double the price.\n\nSome other bad experinces I've had:\n\n* I've had taxi drivers who have had a newspaper infront of the steering wheel while driving, texting while driving, pouring drinks, peeling bananas, etc all while the car is moving, meaning that they didn't have their hands on the wheel while driving.\n\n* I've had taxi drivers who have been up to 30 minutes late and then take 2 hours to get there. I was actually late for my first lesson because of this (I've had one brilliant driver who has actually been early and driven to my destination in 1 hour and 15 minutes at the same time on the same day)\n\n* The one female driver I've had spoke to me very slowly. I thought that at first she done this because she had a strong accent and it was difficult to understand her. But then when she parked the car across the street she kept saying \"No No stay there\" then crossed the street and made me hold her arm to cross the street like I was going to get run over if I didn't. She asked me what I was studying, I told her and she responded in what sounded like a sarcastic tone (Can't remember what she said but whatever it was it sounded like she was talking to a baby or a dog). I don't know what the company said about me to make me think that I mentally challenged.\n\n* I've had a taxi who have gone 50mph in a 30 zone while turning a corner. I was pushed back into my seat when he suddenly accelerated. I've had others who went quite fast but no where near as fast as him.\n\n* One taxi driver played really loud Indian music (It didn't have any instruments it just sounded like a guy singing). It was the worst music I've heard in my life. It was so loud that I couldn't drown it out with my earphones unless I turned it up to volume where it would hurt my ears. He was playing the news before which I was fine with. That was the absolute worst taxi driver I had. I'm a pretty shy guy and he made me feel uncomfortable as soon as I saw him shout at woman who were walking across the street. They weren't even being slow, they were moving at a normal pace. I asked the taxi company not to send him again and they did the next week anyway (although he was much better the second time).\n\nThere was one taxi driver who played the news at a reasonable volume, didn't speed, didn't go on his phone every 2 minutes, arrived on time and dropped me off 45 minutes before my classes started (at 10) every time. Out of the 11ish taxi drivers I've had so far he, along with 2 others were the only ones who actually acted professional. ",

        "text": "   I don't use Reddit often but a friend of mine suggested I post this here to alert some awareness. So excuse me If I mess something up posting this.\n\n\n( If I cant post photos or video in the thread I'll put an IMGUR link of the situation below in comments. If that's ok.)\n\n\n  I am a Concept Artist / Illustrator that works on Video Games and Animations. My computer is very important to me and my career, while I do a lot of Freelance work I also have companies that outsource me work. So me not having my computer and not able to do work hurts me a lot financially. You see where I'm going here...\n\n Anyways, I recently moved to West Coast from East Coast to solidify my career in the field much better. I had my computer shipped from my home to me  in California using \" Pack/Ship Company \" B \". I paid extra money to have it sent properly and safely and insured it for \" $2500 \" ( The hardware inside of it is worth more.)\n\nI received my computer in the mail it was damaged. My video card was broken, my rear usb ports were loose and hanging off, my cages on my computer were bent and wouldn't fit on anymore. When it gets turned on my OS loads and then crashes right back to the Boot, and it's a continuous cycle of only that. They came and picked it up to inspect it and then, After spending almost 2 weeks back and forth everyday on the phone getting no more and me having no more patience to give while I'm wondering where my package and my compensation is. \n\n They tell me...\n\nA.) There is no physical damage. ( When there clearly is.)\nB.) They don't know where my package is. ( Oh Joy...)\nC.) They can only compensate for a measly amount that wouldn't even fix half of the damage.\n\nBy this time now, I am living in the expensive West Coast and NO income so for almost a month I have been having no income and I just moved out here, and things have been extremely hard for me when they shouldn't have been. I have also lost one of my biggest outsourcing networks for work because I had some work they needed and more to be finished but all due to this I pretty much have been job/income less and they really couldn't care especially from the way they handle this situation.\n\nI then randomly get a call from a number on the SouthEast of the US saying they have my damaged package and they don't know why. Oh Joy, the man sends it back to me and even says to me...\n\n\" This is a NICE computer. It must have cost a fortune but man they tore this thing up.I thought about keeping it but, I decided not to because I need some good karma and I can tell it's for a Gamer and an Artist. \"\n\nHe apparently found me and my phone number and gave me a call which I'm very grateful for and said he's sending it back to shipper.\n\n\nIt ends up taking EXTREMELY long for my package to come back to me all \" Company B\" is telling me they aren't going to compensate me full if at all blah blah and they don't know where package is. ( I think they tried to lose it on purpose to be completely honest. Because I caused so much of a ruckus about it and it's valued so high. \"\n\n10/16/2015 \n\nI end up finally getting package back and I call Company B before I even open it and while on the phone with the representative I open the package and realize it's damaged even worse. Pieces of it are shattered and loose, things are out place and it's ridiculous. Now I'm not sure what to because now it's going to cost me even more to get things fixed and replaced.\n\nI just want you all to know be careful using Pack/Ship Company B.",

        "text": "I bought a refrigerator from a big box store.\n\nThe delivery was scheduled, the delivery guys called a half hour before they arrived, they took away the old fridge and installed the new one.\n\nAwesome.\n\nBefore they left, they had me fill out a little survey about their service.  They told me if I don't give them the highest score, their company gives them the lowest score.\n\nNo problem.  I've found delivery people here to be very reliable.\n\nAfter they left, I go to open my new fridge for the first time.\n\nI pull on the door handle and the whole fridge rolls 6 inches out into my kitchen. \n\nYikes!  Pretty sure it's not supposed to do that.\n\nI roll it back in place and as I lean in to to put something in the back, the fridge rolls back and hits the wall.  Damn it.\n\nI roll it back into place and consult the manual.  It says that the fridge should have been \"leveled\" by adjusting two plastic feet in the front until it sat firmly in place.\n\nYeah, the delivery guys didn't do that.  I review the four picture leveling guide and it says I can use a flathead screwdriver inserted into the plastic foot to adjust each foot.\n\nI'm pretty handy, so I attempt to do this.  It doesn't work.  There is no way those little feet are moving and I'm afraid I'll break them if I apply too much pressure.\n\nSo I call big box store major appliance customer service.  Yes, they have a separate customer service number for major appliances.\n\nThe customer service rep answers the phone and I explain the problem that my refrigerator rolls around when I try to use it.\n\nHis response?  \"Well, if it's on wheels, it's gonna roll.\"\n\nNow, I've had a rough week including multiple trips to the hospital for a loved one and I'm about done with people giving me shit.\n\nI, in the chilliest voice I can manage, explain to this douchebag that the manual says it should not roll around and if he insists I should keep using it like this, I'll be happy to sue his company when it falls on one of my kids as the manual also stated improper installation could result in the appliance tipping over.\n\nHe puts me on hold, comes back and tells me someone from the delivery company will be in contact with me \"some day\".  Yes, he actually said \"some day\".\n\nI go on the company's facebook page and make a nice, long post about how disappointed I am in their customer service and how I sure hope my new fridge doesn't fall on anyone before I'm contacted \"some day\".\n\nA half hour later I have someone from the delivery company calling me to let me know they'll be here tomorrow to fix it.",

        "text": "I'm from Germany and have never seen a self checkout, I heard about it, but never encountered one. Now I'm in Australia and the big supermarkets have these. I didn't want to use them, because I'm too uncomfortable about asking someone how they work, so I always used the normal checkouts. Yesterday in the evening I got into one of these stores and wanted to buy something to drink. I headed to the checkouts, but there wasn't a cashier, so I had to use the self checkouts. I was really worried and even thought about putting my drink back and go out without buying anything. But I really wanted that drink and it costs 2$ more at these 24/7 stores. So I asked some employee who was there and he seemed happy about explaining it to me and so on. I was kinda fascinated and am so happy I'm now able to use them.\n\nTL;DR: Didn't know how self checkouts work, nice employee explains it to me and we both are happy.\n\nI know, that this might be boring for the most, but I just wanted to say, that there are nice people, even in retail. ;)",
