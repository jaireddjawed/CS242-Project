        "text": "Hi, I don't know how Reddit works, I saw a lot of posts on insta so I am asking for help from anyone here on Reddit. \n\nI(21,F) have always been very dotting on my sister(19,F) which she also reciprocated but since the end of covid there has been a drift between us which I couldn't pinpoint. Maybe it's because I work 9-6 from Monday to Saturday and by the time Sunday rolls around I am basically numb. So now recently we went on an IV from college and I joined the gang(around 5-7 people) as we were all friends during my college years. \n\nMy sisters behaviour was off, she did not spend a single 5-10 min with me throughout the 7 days of IV and she was constantly with this mutual friend who we will call Joker coming forward. The rest also had changed behaviour, they wouldn't talk to me and one guy straight up told me that imagine she is not your sister for the entire IV. \n\nJoker is a much older guy to us, he is good looking and comes from a very orthodox family background. I saw her clingling to the guy's arm,exchanging flirty looks and everything, as soon as she woke up she would go to his room to wake him up, they would eat all the meals together, she changed her eating habits for him. He is a pure vegetarian and we are non vegetarians, so she stopped eating any meat for him, her preferred chocolate also changed, her way of dressing and how she carries herself.\n\nMost of all the thing that changed was her behaviour towards me, I am scared I might sound selfish by putting all my feelings into words but I need some advice. \n\nI have a medical condition which has actually affected me mentally, so I am more emotional than I ever was. I breakdown quite a lot so my parents are kind of soft and worried about me which you will understand soon. I came to discover the odd changes of my sister during IV and I asked her many times if she was dating him? If anything is going on between them? Why is she not hanging out with me? She would deny all and tell me that I am being very narrow minded and that there is nothing going on between them. And that we do spend a lot of time together We have 3 guys in our group and 2 girls. My sister wasn't treating all the guys similarly,only Joker got the special treatment. \n\nWhen we got back home, which was today i did something which was a very rash decision,  I was worried about my sister and the guy is no good(I have actual reasons why)Believing there was not going to be anything, I went through her texts and I saw many inappropriate things ranging from intimate Gifs and text about how I am a cry baby and my parents side with me only always. \n\nI understand that she is grown up and she can date whoever she wants, I don't want to meddle. I wish she would've been more honest with me and that she could trust me to tell me such things on my face, I wish she knew I wouldn't judge her no matter what, I only want whats best for her and she is my baby sister. I love her with my entire being and existence. Although my methods are wrong, I accept and agree.\n\nDue to my medical condition she sees me as a weak person whom she can never rely on,which is good she should maintain her distance, I don't have a promised future. But at least she could give me more priority than a guy who just came into her life. Maybe she could slow down and learn more about the person before completey trusting him. Is there anyway I can mend our relation? Is there any way I can build the same relation between us?why do I feel like I am losing a huge chunk of my life, my sister means alot to me, finding out that she doesnt feel the same way hurts, but she feels that way for someone else sucks much more. \n\nPlease tell me anything I can do to get my mind out of this gutter, I need help, please help me.",

        "text": "\n\nI 17(m) recently had a break up with my first girlfriend 17(f) and while i am really hurt i started to think about somethings that happend and some beheviours that she had towards me\nI am going to tell some of it here and i would like some help understanding if its from my imagination or of if im misunderstanding some situations,\nSo here are some:\nShe just got from an abusive relationship as she told me, and started liking me and we ended up dating \nWhile in the start she was really cute with me and gave me live letters and things like that some things started making me feel weird \nShe talked with me about sex and the whole sub/dom and bottom/top things, and i knew like nothing about that she said i could make an quiz so see what i liked, the quiz said like 40% dom and the other some other things i dont remember now, but then she started to tease me about it \nCalling me a bottom and sub and this and that\nSometimes in front of some friends of hers with made me unconfortable\nBut i thought it was her way to demonstrate love and affection and she had mentioned that calling names and teasing me for somethings were her form of showing love \nWell it was like that for some time and i was making my best to addapt to her triggers and traumas that she had \nAnd when she had a crisis i would keep calm and help her and she helped me in some of mine too \nI said one day how my mom(who has a lot of mental health issues) would have to spend a lot of time in hospital becouse she was not taking her meds, she helped me feel a little better but i was really down and my messages were very dry becouse i was felling bad for the situation, the problem is that being dry in a conversation was some of her triggers, and while i knew that as she had a crises one day because i was messaging her that way, i was doing my best to not stay dry, it was late at night so she kinda gave me goodnight and left out of the blue, something i never done to her as i would stay up untill 3 am when she had a crisis or something like that,\nBut again i thought it was fine, then later in school as she was going down the stairs of her class and i was waiting her with a friend of hers, she got down and did not even looked me in the eye and got up to the stairs without even talking to me, as i did not even existed, then i questioned her about it and she said i had triggeres a trauma of hers and she thought i needed to be alone and thats why she did that\nOther things were when she started saying mean things about some of my friends to me, and said how she did not like some of them and such \nI had a lot of anxiety about making her mad or making her jelous and end up cutting a lot of people from my life \nIn the end my only friends were her friends\nOne day a girl said i \"looked good\" making a joke as she wanted to make me vote for her on a costume competion on school, but the whole time she started to treat me weird, then she mentioned she was going to change schools becouse did not want to be in the same school and a girl who would do that to her boyfriend\nI did not knew what she was talking about so i asked \"what girl?\" And she got up from the table and just left, detail that her friends were in the same table so i was really embarresed, then a friend of mine asked if i was ok and she got more mad because she did not like him too,\nBut i got up and tried my best to talk with her and it was a load of i am sorry and me felling bad \nI am a very anxious and eachtime i thought i did something that would trigger her my anxiety would get worst\nThere were days she started treating me bad for no reason to then say she did not like something i did,\nI had lost a lot of friends and when she started to make a friendship with a girl i thought i would too because i wanted some new friends, so i asked the girl what she had worked in and things like that, then when i got home she was acting strange so i asked what happend and she kepylt saying \"nothing\" but i insisted and she said i was too interrested in the girl she was talking and that i did not acted like that when we started dating,\nI felt bad again, it wad affecting my sleep and i could not eat right sometimes because i was anxious all the time\nShe would bite me really hard sometimes, and i know its a way to show love and such, but sometimes it was way too hard and it hurt a lot, and she wanted to leave marks and bruises, i did not said anything because i did not want i fight and nothing like that\nShe would invite me to her home sometimes and i live a long way from her house, but when i got there she would be mad and treated me bad,\nThere was a time i did not knew how to use a microwave as i was very poor my entire childhood and never had one, and she laughed and said how dumb i was acting like she was talking to a child, then i mentioned i never had a microwave and she said she was sorry and hugged me, \nI did my best to not fight so when something happened with her and she would take it out in me i just stayed calm and tried to make her feel better\nI met her parents but when her grandma metioned her meeting mine she said she never wanted to meet them and it made me sad \nThose are some things that happend there was still some minor fights and other things, keeping in mind that all of that happend in the 4 months out relationship lasted\n\nWhile all of that said, and thank you so much for reading all of that, it means a lot \nI need to know if those situations are toxic and abusive, and if i was in a toxic and abusive relationship \nIts honestly hard for me to know and i just had the thought that it might be a abusive relationship \nI would like some advice and opinions.\nThank you : )",

The younger female was teaching the senior lady how to swim. I asked the younger lady if the other lady was her mother or grandmother. Her response was she is my mother and told me that it was very rude of me to ask her that question directly and told me that she was offended by it. She told me you don’t ask questions like that. I apologized to her immediately and she accepted my apology. Now here’s the situation we have a lot of people who come and enjoy the pool but sometime some swimmer will try to recruit other people  who doesn’t know how to swim and they will charge them a fee or they bring their own client to teach them and this not allowed in the pool where I work.",

        "text": "I’m a 20s white woman. Long story short, my boyfriend and I moved to an apartment building in the sticks. The building is kind of tucked into the woods and the parking lot is super dark. I’m always vigilant because this town is afflicted with meth addiction and our building is also next to a road that a lot of people walk at night. The town has about 300 people, and I live next to literally the only black person I’ve ever seen here. He looks about 40 and seems nice. \n\nEarlier tonight (it was completely dark outside), I went out to get groceries. Before I got to my car, I saw a quick movement to my left and jumped, but it was just my neighbor walking his dog. The moment I registered it was him I laughed and said, “Scared me to death!” He laughed back. His dog ran up and jumped on me and I pet it but I noticed that while I was “baby-talking” it, he kept a distance of about ten-fifteen feet and sort of backed away with tense body language. Like, fists rigidly at his side. I just waved at him with a smile and got in my car and that was that. \n\nFor some reason though, I can’t shake the feeling that I made him feel shitty or uncomfortable. I think if I were a black man in a town like this, I’d probably be a little nervous to hear a white woman say I scared her in a dark parking lot. I mean, someone literally called me a whore in the grocery store once for wearing a knee-length skirt. It’s that type of town. I just hope I didn’t worry him or hurt his feelings by making him think I was actually scared of him, but my boyfriend says I’m overthinking it. Neither of us know what it’s like to be black, though, so I’m not sure.\n\nDo you think I freaked him out? :/",

        "text": "Hindus consider the cow sacred, and therefore many won't eat beef. One of the reasons they consider them sacred is because they make milk, which can be drunk used in cuisine and used in religious rituals etc. Cows are also sacred because they are mainly used to work the fields, especially in ancient times. Because of all the benefits of cows, many Hindus refrain from eating beef, because our scriptures say it is a sin to kill a cow.\n\nHowever, part of the dairy industry involves cows being killed when they can't produce milk anymore and calves are killed for beef. Therefore, if a Hindu lives in a country where this happens in the dairy industry, is it hypocritical for them to consume and use dairy products?\n\nI understand there are some farms that don't kill cows in the dairy industry, but this milk is to expensive for me to buy.",

        "text": "A lot of people take it for granted that children socialize with other children primarily, and it's noteworthy when a child prefers to socialize with adults (or when anyone gets along better with people of different ages). Kids are raised by their parents and taught by their teachers yet it's other children who they prefer to copy for their social behaviour. Many adults do not involve children in most of their social activities and vice versa.\n\nThis is a major contrast to most of the time we humans evolved as a species, before the separation of work, education, and family life, and to many people today. It's just normal to them.\n\n[Dr. Gordon Neufeld](https://jenniferfulwiler.com/2008/08/the-lost-children-2/) describes it about his visit to a village in France:\n\n&gt;\\[In Rognes, France\\] children greeted adults and adults greeted children. Socializing involved whole families, not adults with adults and children with children. There was only one village activity at a time, so families were not pulled in several directions…Even at the village fountain, the local hangout, teens mixed with seniors. Festivals and celebrations, of which there were many, were family affairs. The music and dancing brought the generations together instead of separating them.\n\nHe even said that \"\\[the childrens' teachers\\] were their teachers whether on the grounds or in the village market or at the village festival.\" Most teachers in the United States and Canada would not even consider having a relationship like this.\n\nPeople ask things like \"Can you be a parent/teacher and have a social life?\" If we are at the point where these things are mutually exclusive, then there's a problem.\n\nChildren being involved in adults' social lives is not a problem. It's healthier for the children because they get to rely on mature people for social support instead of immature people who are not concerned about their social development.",

He would do this alone in his apartment, like every week, often three days in a row with no sleep. That didn't bother me at the early stages of our relationship, but we became serious rapidly. His consuming spaced out over time (once a month), but never faded. He is very loving and caring towards me, fulfilling my every need and, besides that, I know he is genuinely a nice person. One night, after we threw a small gathering at his place, I went to bed (it was like 6am), and he stayed up drinking and getting high alone. When I woke up, he was asleep and I went through his phone to find out he was sexting with random girls (sex workers) that night, while I was asleep, and many times before. Turned out, he does that every time he gets high. He never went to see any of these girls, it was just texting, jacking off while communocating with live girls. I was heartbroken, to say the least. I broke up with him after I found that out, but after a few days of him begging me on his knees to get bavk together and promising me that things will change, I decided to give him another chance. And, as you may guess, the same thing happened several times after that. And every time he was begging me to come back... with the same result. He went to a psychiatrist and he gave him meds that he constantly delay to start taking. Last night, the same thing happened. Now, he's accusing me of being unreasonable, bc his friend just had a son and my bf just had to get high (and he was sure that won't lead to texting sex workers). It did. He's still working \"his thing\" while I'm writing this. I know he planned to start taking meds two weeks from now (after out trip, that was supposed to start tomorrow), and things may change after his therapy. He's planning our wedding, kids, etc. and I really love him, but I gave him so many chances and I really don't know if I should continue trying to cure his addiction. I really need an advice.",

        "text": "I have a long history with being bullied. It's happened all my life since I was in elementary school. I clearly remember since first grade I was constantly kicked and abused, or called names. Sometimes it was more verbal than physical, other times it was more physical. \nIn middle school I got thrown little rocks at me and I was threatened several times. I actually switched schools and stuff, but I kept getting bullied no matter what, by boys and girls, too.\n\nVery few times I actually defended myself. Most of the time I would just ask for help to my teachers, but they would either not believe me, or do simple stuff like telling them to stop. Only twice the school called the parents of the bullies, but nothing was really solved.\n\nHowever, in High School it was the worst of the worst. There was this guy that just verbally, physically and emotionally attacked me all the time for no reason. It was actually a group of kids, and he was the \"leader.\" So, he would often incite others to attack me, too. They even tried to drown me once in swimming class when the teacher was not looking. And this is the guy that I'm talking about. He was my last school bully and I'm afraid this experience has scarred me for life. Every time I talk about high school he comes straight to my mind. I even have nightmares about him sometimes. Whenever I even mention his name my eyes start watering and my throat closes. I think I will never be able to move on, but I wish I could forgive him. And I want to talk to him just to let it out. I'm not asking for an apology or anything like that, I just want to spit out all that venom that has been consuming me. I don't want to offend him, but I want him to realize how his actions affected me.\n\nBut is it a good idea?",

        "text": " So, shows like the walking dead, Station 11, and TLOU make is seem like overnight society just goes \"POOF\". There's a spectrum they all follow: normal -&gt; normal but people start hearing somethings off -&gt; oh shit moment -&gt; a bunch of chaos -&gt; government tries in vain to restore order -&gt; anarchy as the government collapses, leading to power vacuum nation wide -&gt; loss of basic systems like water and power.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is realistic on a short time frame. Given with how covid 19 happened, we heard about it for a series of months leading up to march 2020, and then the aftermath was there for weeks to months afterwards depending on what state you were in. I feel like a true \"collapse\" of society would take at least at minimum of a year, to up to a few decades, before we reached the \"point of no return\" when most people realize industrialized society is never coming back.\n\nI imagine the start would be either an economic or weather event that makes basic resources like food and water expensive/scarce for most citizens living in western society, or alternative, an event that starts to gradually kill a significant amount of people. Not enough to like, wipe out a whole city, but it becomes noticeable. Everyone would have a story of someone they know affected.\n\nThat would be the moment that people switch from \"normal mode\" to \"holy shit\" mode. It also wouldn't be long until the government responded and probably deployed the military to keep order, as we see in many media. But I think from this point on till the government loses full control would last a lot longer. I still think electricity and things like the internet would still be around for a while, as people would be working non stop to keep these running like what's happening currently in ukraine.\n\nSociety could function somewhat normally, even if deeply wounded, for a long time. I think the true \"point of no return\" then is when the demographic collapse hits; when theres simply so many people dying and not enough children being produced fast enough to replace them it becomes a positive feedback loop, and the last of civilization flickers out. This, again, could take decades.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

Since then, church members receive anonymous typewritten letters which include Bible verses, etc.  They are unsigned and mailed with no return address.  We know it's Cooper behind all of it. Because we don't have exact proof that it's them, what can we do to enact some type of revenge?

        "text": "I have been friends with this girl for over 4 years. We met dancing and in the beginning, I did not like her in any way. At that time I thought that she was not:  good-looking,  polite or friendly. Fast forward, due to all the dancing, us seeing each other weekly and staying in contact through messages and events, a feeling grew inside me. (she changed a lot during this time). First, I thought it was affection, so I used to constantly tell her how comfortable I felt with her and such a good friend she was. However, 2 years into our friendship, I started to have actual feelings. That year, during my birthday party (21 yo), I asked her to dance with me, after the dance we sat on the sofa, started vibing while holding hands and she asked me about my religious beliefs. That moment made me realise that I wanted someone like her in my life and I did not want that feeling to end. So, I tried to kiss her that night, which wasn't the best idea. As you can expect she said \"no\" politely, and left with some friends. However, she told no one and called me the next morning asking for an explanation, to which I gave a bald response to. Fast forward, she grew distant from me due to this incident, and it took me a long time to get her back. However, it wasn't the same. She went back to being her old self and I hated it.\n\nHence, during my master's year and after I graduated (2021), I decided to take a break from her and cut all interactions. However, every time I started flirting with girls, I used to think of her and compare them (she always won). At the same time, due to my circumstances, I lost confidence in myself and my motivation to work, gained weight (72kg --&gt; 90kg) and isolated myself from people. In March 2022, I decided to make a change and I went back to dance lessons. I did not really like them at the beginning. However, one night I saw her dancing and she left me mesmerised. I could not stop watching her and to be honest, to suppress my emotions I ignored her for the first 2 months. However, the only reason why I kept going to lessons was that I knew she was going to be there. During this time, thanks to salsa and all the events that I was attending, I lost 8kg and I gained a lot of confidence to do things on my own. However, after all that time, one night I could not resist anymore and I asked her to dance with me. That moment was so weird, she was a pro and I was a beginner. After spending more time going to dance events, during which I had the chance to talk to her, our friendship started to grow bit by bit. After 4-5 months of constant messaging ( to which she was very unresponsive at the beginning), I got to a point where she was just how she used to be just before I fucked up. We started hanging out in groups, and a few months ago she started to invite me to other cities for dance events. In my mind, I kept thinking, \"I like this friendship and how things are when she is around.\". However, during this time, she constantly kept reminding me that she was going to leave her current position within the next year to move back to London for dancing and better career opportunities. During that time I kept thinking to myself. \"Once, I graduate from this course I will ask her out\", which then turned into \"once I get a job I will ask her out\", which then turned into \"once I am a decent dancer I will ask her out\". I had this mindset because  I was expecting her to go sometime in June/July 2023 (from all the messages we had). Nevertheless, yesterday during our 2h long train conversation, she told me that she left her job last week and that she was going to be moving back to London in 2 weeks. I hid how I was feeling very well. I pretended I was fine and happy for her(which I am). However, after I dropped her at her house, I broke down. All the feelings that I had kept for the last few years and the regret of not having asked her out directly during all the time emerged all of a sudden.\n\nWe will meet her on Thursday for food and some activities. Currently, I  am preparing myself to tell her how I feel (just to get it out of me and move on). I do not expect a positive outcome (since she has previously mentioned that she doesn't want to date anyone atm and that she is not interested in me). However, I don't want to feel this uncertainty to stay in my chest for months. If you got any advice to give, I would be more than happy to hear it.",

Thus, producing pillars to be able to establish a solid foundation above or Atop the sand. Now, to tackle, the very essence of a desert environment, without abolishing the existing balances of the creatures who call the desert home. I think the same method could be used, by creating an attachment to vibrate sand in a certain area, where you would like to build an in-ground basin to hold water, moreover seeing that a lot of desert environments are by large bodies of water. A stream could be funneled in and an underground system of tunnels could be used to supply multiple oasis that could, in-turn, supply mini cities. Now, i open the floor to you, creatIve THINKers.

I really do not judge her on this matter (and she's a very nice person overall), I guess I just want a little input on how to process the situation as a curiosity in the existentential and clinical senses lol: she hoards many versions of X. These are not meant to be investment pieces, kept in mint-condition like jewelry, comic books or artwork/etc. Some she uses, most are just hoarded and stored away. These are *very* expensive items. I would not be surprised if the total cost of her collection has reached a few million dollars. The quantity has been overwhelming she's had to rent lockers to have space to store them and is contemplating renovating her house to add a \"wing\" to store them closer to her. She can afford it, money is not the issue. She says it makes her happy buying them and seeing it in her possession. \n\nClearly, this need is rooted from her childhood and family struggles with money. I guess it make me happy for her that these things are accessible to her and bring her comfort/security, but a part of me worries for her that this level of excess or trauma resolution seems to be on the unhealthy side, but I'm not sure unhealthy how exactly lol. It's not a health hazard. She overindulges, but can easily afford it. No one's getting hurt and it's like a security blanket for her. I can't say if it's an unhealthy emotional crutch or good security blanket, actually... I haven't said anything to her about it (not sure if there's anything to say, no matter how well-intentioned), not even a hint of maybe talking to a therapist? I suppose it is a form of addiction, but if there isn't any negative impact on her and others, just let it be? I mean, there are tons of rich people with other collections of similar or bigger $$ value. I suppose 'excessive' can be a subjective and relative word.\n\nI guess I'm not sure if it's my personal bias that I see it as unhealthy because of my personal views which lean toward anti-consumerist and to not get attached to material things, or if it *is* objectively something of concern. \n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "Yearly, at least one student emails me this question, after wholly relying on passive reading then failing the exam. They successfully remember and can regurgitate everything from the textbook and lectures; can compute a question if analogous enough to something déjà vu, and something they saw before; and can prove straightforward corollaries. But they can't answer unseen, new-fashioned questions or trickier computations. They wholly fail to prove more abstract results.\n\n&gt;Students tend to *prefer* passive studying **because it's easier and more comfortable**. In fact, [this Harvard study](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2019/09/03/1821936116.full.pdf) shows that most students even convince themselves that passive methods are more effective, and that lecturing professors provide \"better learning\" than professors who engage students in-class projects, even though those hands-on projects ultimately provide much deeper education than traditional passive methods. [[Source]](https://www.brainscape.com/academy/active-studying-vs-passive-studying/)\n\n## But why precisely does passive study fail for learning math? Why can't math students simply read multiple textbooks on the same subject + DETAILED FULL solutions to exercises and problems, in lieu of picking up a writing implement and plugging away at exercises? \n\nI am seeking explanations more detailed, scholarly, and specific to math than [this](https://www.leonardoenglish.com/blog/passive-language-learning-is-bullshit). \n\n&gt;The reason is that learning is not a passive activity. As [some researchers](http://mjltm.org/files/site1/user_files_a9608a/admin-A-10-1-23-7c58f0c.pdf#page=125) have stated, \n&gt;\n&gt;_“Students cannot learn just by attending the classes, listening to teachers, memorising ready-made assignments, and producing answers. They must talk about what they are learning (output), write about it (integration), connect it to past knowledge, and use it in their daily lives. They must make what they learn part of their lives by practice.”_\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem with passive learning is that you [don’t engage with the information you receive.](https://universeofmemory.com/optimize-your-language-learning/) And that means you don’t learn it as well.\n\n&gt;This is not always so when recalling facts in a self-test—more effort is often required to bring the facts to mind, so they don’t seem as solid. From a student’s point of view, it can seem obvious which method—restudying—produces better learning. Robert Bjork refers to this as an “illusion of competence” after restudying. The student concludes that she knows the material well based on the confident mastery she feels at that moment.\n&gt;\n&gt;And she expects that the same mastery will be there several days later when the exam takes place. But this is unlikely. The same illusion of competence is at work during cramming, when the facts feel secure and firmly grasped. While that is indeed true at the time, it’s a mistake to assume that long-lasting memory strength has been created. - [Robert Madigan - How Memory Works](https://books.google.pl/books/about/How_Memory_Works_and_How_to_Make_It_Work.html?id=R3T3CQAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y).\n\n### https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/q/25798",

        "text": "  \n\nI am leaving out as many details as possible and just getting to the important parts:\n\nI am an only child. My parents divorced when I was 2 and my dad went into the Navy. He spent the rest of my life living in California, Hawaii, Japan and Washington while I lived in the Midwest of the US. He eventually retired from the Navy as soon as he could, with a minimal pension. He eventually moved into his parents' old house when his mother died, buying his only brother's (who hated him and himself died in 2018) half, so he owned it 100%. He was a bitter man loved by no one. He later (2019) sold the house for pennies on the dollar because he was probably out of money. He then continued to smoke and drink himself to death, which finally came in May 2021. Apparently he died in the entryway to the house that our family had lived in since 1963. The only way I (his only surviving family member) found out that he had died was because the man who bought his house (with the clear intention of waiting him out and then flipping it) had done a welfare check, found him dead, did some research and found me, offering me the chance to take whatever I wanted from the house.\n\nSo, I think that covers the important facts of the case. My question is: what happened to his body? Obviously the local authorities were notified and the body was taken away, but then what? There is no one to mourn him. For years he would call my mom (his ex-wife who despised him) to literally cry about his lot in life and she only answered the phone out of pity. He was clearly out of money... was his corpse thrown in a pile? Was he cremated? I have no idea. If I left any pertinent aspect out, please let me know.\n\nFinally, you might be tempted to say \"sorry for your loss\". The world is better without him, honestly. When I say he died unloved it is not an exaggeration, not just a bitter abandoned son saying that. No one lost anything, except for the tobacco and whiskey companies, which lost one hell of a customer.",

You don't need to be Linux superuser to figure it out. With whatever feed you get your news/stories from, I guarantee you there's a button that says \"Show me less of this\". If you go on Facebook or Instagram you can \"see less of\" a poster or unsubscribe. You can choose your own music playlists so it's not like you can only listen to music through a radio with a host talking about the celebrity gossip you don't care about.\n\nI used to get so annoyed by Christmas music by the time Christmas came around. It struck me this year that the way I cultivate my feeds/playlists/etc... meant I genuinely didn't hear a Christmas song until December 25th this year. Similarly, whenever I make a new Reddit account, I unsubscribe from the default subs and subscribe to those that give me sufficiently intellectual content (like this one!) and I don't have to hear anything about the Royals/Kardashians/Ryan Reynolds or this people I have no clue about.\n\nHowever, once in a while I'll still see a comment about it or hear from someone in person - \"Ugh, I'm so tired of having to read about Person X\". I try to dig deep into why they need to read about them, but usually I come off as annoying. This sub might be a better place.\n\nWith all the tools that technology gives us, why do people feel compelled to keep up with whatever's going on with Ryan Reynolds or whatever if they don't want to? To me it's shockingly easy to just...not.",

Since around the start of 2022. ive started to self harm with act such as putting my phone torch on my arm until it will get really hot until i have to just take it off or use a matchstick and other way would be simply cutting myself with a boxcutter id randomly find around the house. My mum earns around 1200 every month(or even less) and shes had new child (daughter) iin march 2022. The father of her is not mine so she is my half sister although with 3 kids in the house. Me my brother and half sister its like she is incapable of taking care of me financially or mentally to the point im just always in my room 24/7 and hungry all the time. My brother had a job at a fast food restaurant (hes 17) and the money he has left over from that and the money mum only give him he is able to order food from online or go to the supermarket to buy some there. Recently they would never buy \"actual\" food that would last instead of stuff such as milk , cereal ,lunch resourdes , etc. And id be left off to just eat the same thing everyday.. this would be stuff such as (frozen pizza and toast) all the time. Im not eating foods much that consist of stuff such as protein, good source of vitamins or iron. Today i told my mum if she could go down and get milk so i could make something like pancakes( theres no cereal so i couldn't of said that) she instead told me to just make toast and theres 2 slices of bacon in the fridge. When i told her \"thats what i had yesteeday and i cant just have that all day \" she replied saying \" well thats your options\" she continued to have another child although we were already struggling to even purchase food normally for just me and my brother. Its left me starving currently now as im writing this and they instead just decide to buy stuff like cigarettes and just snacks. Yesterday all i hate was a bag of sweets crisps and toast with bacon. Im unable to properly wash my clothes aswell as she does not let me and so i prevent from going out with others too. I have a dog ( he was here before my sister was born) although ever since my mum had  a baby we can just not take care off him and he is not even out of his cage for more then 10 minutea every day leaving him to stand and sleep in his own urine and fecication. Ive told my mum if we are able to get  rid of him so soneone else may take care off him better but she always just says \" what if they don't look after him\" it jarrs me cus i doubt what ever they would do is even worse then the state he currently is in. I keep thinking to reach out to CPS but theres this girl who is the same age as me and goes to my school. She is one of the first people in my whole ever life that has shown genuine love for me and i love that fact that im dating her. But if i were to leave the current home im in now im afraid i may lose her as she is litterally the only person i talk to. I do not mind living in another persons house (unless they do not treat my right) but if i cant speak to my girlfriend then i just dont know if i wanna cut through with that decision, i have a great relationship with her mother and i just dont what to lose this feeling. I do not care if lose any of my gaming consoles or the things i love the most. I just want to be in a stable home where i can eat properly and have a better lifestyle and still be able to talk to the person im dating. May soneone please message me or give me some advice?",
