You will never build muscle otherwise.\n\nSecondly, it takes a really long time to see those results, and this is where many people give up.  I took progress photos nearly every day and I would say it took me around 12 weeks to see a noticeable difference between my first and last photo.  And it was a very small difference.  Don't listen to the magazine ads that claim you will pack on 10 lbs of muscle in 3 months, or that you can lose 27 lbs in 6 weeks for summer, etc.  These things take a really long time, stick with it, and you will be rewarded.\n\nSo if you want to start getting in shape for summer vacation, there are two times to start: Either right now, when you still have a shot at making a small but noticeable difference in time, or the day after your vacation when you can put in a year's worth of work for next year!",

        "text": "You are overthinking again. There’s a lot of backlogs that you want to accomplish, things you want to have, and dreams you want to achieve all at the same time. Your thoughts are pressuring you once again. I know that you have told yourself for so many times already that you need to trust the process, but there really are times like this when your mind is playing tricks with you and telling you that you’re getting left behind in life. I want to tell you that you are not. There really are things that need to be done step by step no matter how small its progress each day is. Waiting for your dreams to be a reality is the crucial part because while you are waiting, you also start seeing other people and their life achievements. \n\nThat’s when you will feel the pressure because you thought they have it all figured out while you are still struggling. Well, let me break it to you. All of us look like we have everything figured it out, but the reality is that all of us are struggling with our own life challenges. I hope that you will just take everything one step at a time and don’t compare your first step to someone else’s one thousandth step. Well, don’t ever compare your steps to someone else’s because your steps will someday lead you to the door and path that’s meant for you and just for you. Just keep on trusting the process. You’ll get there.",

I've grown up in a toxic household all my life and it's still the same, my parents are constantly fighting, hurling words at each other and there's absolutely no mutual respect between them. Growing up, I had to take care of their problems as a kid, that I really shouldn't have, from dealing with screaming parents, to making sure I don't make the smallest of mistakes because if I do, it'll turn into a fight between them and will escalate into a mess. \n\nAnd, in therapy, I realized that I've never actually felt love that's unconditional, the love from my parents was always conditional, you do this, and you're our favorite child, \"good children don't do these\" and given that I know the consequences are horrible whenever they fight, I barely ever went against them, or get into trouble so that they don't start fighting about it. \n\nAnd this has affected me in every relationship I've been on, whether that's a friendship or a romantic one,  I tend to overcompensate when there's a fight, I barely ever understand boundaries and even in instances I've been abusive and/or manipulative without even realizing the consequences of my actions. \n\nNow, I don't want to attribute my behavior with my mental health and certainly don't want to act like I'm a victim, but according to my therapist, I never knew what a healthy relationship is supposed to be like because my main caregivers were people who were in an extremely unhealthy relationship with zero intention to get better. \n\nSo, I'm asking for tips, how do I build relationships that are meaningful and sustainable and doesn't come at a cost, I don't wanna be a piece of shit and I don't want to hurt people ever again, I don't want to continue the toxic cycle of abuse that I've been a part of, any help would be very kind, thank you!",

        "text": "Drink plenty of water / remain well hydrated everyday\nhttps://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2023/good-hydration-linked-healthy-aging\n\nDrink plenty of liquids / water to the point where your urine is a very light yellow. If its clear then you're overhydrating and if its yellow or darker or you are not urinating often, you should drink more water. Keep in mind certain vitamins in food / supplements can change your urine color (e.g. B vitamins). Remaining hydrated properly everyday has been shown to be very beneficial for long-term health outcomes.\n\nAim for 7-8 hours of sleep daily\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864873/\n\nMake time for sleep! You don't have to be a morning person depending on your lifestyle but go to bed with enough time to sleep as close to 8 hours as you can. Maintaining a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends or vacations, can help reinforce this habit. Find what works for you.\n\nDon't neglect sleep hygiene! \n\nThe duration of sleep is important but so is the quality of the sleep. Avoid caffeine within 8 hours of going to bed. Avoid alcohol before bed. Avoid light pollution in your bedroom and make sure it's a comfortable temperature. If you get heartburn when you lay down, look into treatment or avoid eating too close to bedtime. Also some people benefit from adding a foam layer to their mattress that will incline your sleeping position, this makes gravity work for you. If you sleep but are still very tired, talk to a doctor about a sleep study. Many people have sleep apnea and it's a death sentence if not treated over time. Pay attention to what improves your sleep and make it consistent.\n\nBe physically active at least 30 minutes a day!\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33239356/\n\nThis does not have to be hard exercise at the gym. Simply going for a half hour walk around outside is beneficial. Find something you enjoy whether it's hiking, walking around the neighborhood, biking, or actually going to a gym for exercise. Even if you're not wanting to lose weight, physical activity regardless of weight, has been shown to be extremely beneficial.\n\nBe social and interact with people to the level you need!\n\nHumans are ultimately social creatures and by getting out into the world, meeting people and doing stuff with them, we find meaning and happiness. This can be incredibly challenging now a days so finding hobbies or groups of common interest or friends online can be beneficial ways to make this happen. Check out the \"rat park\" experiment on addiction for some background.",
