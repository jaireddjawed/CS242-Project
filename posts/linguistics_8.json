        "text": "Do you have a question about language or linguistics? You’ve come to the right subreddit! We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

You can see phrases like \"أقبل علي\" [ˈaqbala ʕaˈlajja] \"he came towards me\" where the verb \"came towards\" shares the same root with the word qabl. The word \"قِبلة\" [ˈqɪbla], which means the direction which muslims \"face\" to pray, also shares the same root.\n\nIn English, you may see phrases like \"right before my eyes\" or \"I bough before you\".\n\nAnd in Turkish, the word for before is \"önce\" [œndʒe̞] and is clearly derived from the word from front \"ön\".\n\nHow come three unrelated languages have the same conceptualization of these two words which is completely illogical to me?",

We don't have any speech disabilities/impairments and I'm not someone who mixes up words/phrases/idioms easily (like saying  an \"excrementally\" instead of \"incrementally\" etc. lol). Why/how might this have happened, and why didn't I notice I was saying it or sounded different in the first place? \nHas anyone else experienced something similar?",

        "text": "Gdańsk, or Danzig in German, is one of Central and Eastern Europe's most culturally- and historically-significant cities. Being the largest port in all of Poland, it was a prominent Teutonic fort in the 1300s and 1400s, then a Hanseatic trade city in the late 1400s to 1500s, then the export central for Poland, Europe's bread basket, in the 1600s and 1700s, and finally one of the most important disputes on the continent in the 1900s. Today, although Gdańsk has lost its political significance, it is still a flourishing city with a population of nearly 500 thousand. But what about its name?\n\nThe first ever recorded mention of Gdańsk comes from page 69 of the biography of St. Adalbert of Prague, who was sent in the 990s by Bolesław, Duke and future King of Poland, on a mission to the pagan lands of Prussia, where he was killed in 997. Shortly after his death, a *vita* (saint's biography) of St. Adalbert was released, which read \"Ip\\[s\\]e ů adut primo urbē gẏddaⁿẏzc · quā duci\\[s\\] lati\\[ss\\]ima regna dirimentē mari\\[s\\] confinia tangunt\". This roughly translates to \"First came \\[Adalbert\\] to the city of Gyddanzyc, where \\[Bolesław\\]'s most distant holdings touched the seashore\".\n\n[Source: diglib.hab.de\\/wdb.php?dir=mss\\/553-helmst \\(page 142\\)](https://preview.redd.it/akc5h01dx5ga1.png?width=1061&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=658dcd65926f36b601cecd4ecafd2f835d4d9464)\n\nThe name *gyddanyzc* is probably a corrupted version of the Slavic name for the city judging by its pronunciation (/gidanid͡zk/), which is close to today's \"Gdańsk\". The lack of the distinct &lt;ń&gt; sound comes from the fact that yer loss and the creation of those consonants only started coming about around Adalbert's time.¹\n\nThe name Gdańsk comes from the Slavic root \\**-gъd* (wet, moisty) combined with the suffix \\**-ьsk*, denoting a settlement or location.² Gdańsk was, at first, a fishing village located in the swampy lowlands of the Vistula delta and nothing more, so it made sense for it to be called that. That name, \\**gъd(n)ьsk*, stuck around. The back yer was removed and an &lt;a&gt; was added for ease of pronunciation, while *&lt;*nь&gt; turned into &lt;ń&gt; as was the custom with the front yer.¹\n\nAs with the other names, they are all derivatives of the Proto-Slavic name. The earliest mention of the name Danzig I could find comes from the 1592 book *Historia rerum Prussicarum*, however I cannot say when or how the name got corrupted. Gedanum is Gdańsk, but the &lt;ń&gt; is de-palatalized and the Latin suffix -anum is added at the end. Gduńsk, the city's Kashubian name, is probably an early corruption of Gdańsk definitely related to Old Prussian phonetics (any help with this or how Danzig came to be will be very welcome).\n\nGdańsk switched hands, and also names, a lot throughout its history. Although initially Gdańsk beginning in the 900s, the Prussian Teutonic Order took over the town in 1308 and turned it into a large fort, at which time the Danzig corruption of the name was probably developed, but in 1466, following the Peace of Thorn, the fort became part of Poland and became Gdańsk again and remained as such until 1772, when the Prussians took over the city and continued their rule up until 1920, when the largely-German Free City of Danzig took charge of the city, which remained under the name Danzig until 1945, when the Stalinist government of Poland deported all the Germans and imported thousands of Poles into the city. Since then, the city has been Gdańsk, but also a bit Gduńsk. Up until the 1800s, you could also see a bit of Gedanum in the city's upper class.\n\nSo yeah, that is a brief rundown of the historical linguistics of the beautiful port city of Gdańsk. Hope y'all enjoyed this!\n\n¹ *Zarys gramatyki porównawczej języków słowiańskich.* Zdzisław Stieber, 2005.\n\n² *Gramatyka historyczna języka polskiego*. Zenon Klemensiewicz, 1981.",

        "author": "M4arint",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/10tc9o0/chakavian_officially_declared_a_language_by/",
        "text": "**January the 30th, 2023 - Back in 2020, the Chakavian ''dialect'' was officially declared a language in its very own right. The Croatian media paid absolutely no attention to it whatsoever, despite Chakavian being one of the three ''dialects'' from which modern standard Croatian is derived.**\n\nBack during the pandemic-dominated year of 2020, without much fanfare and completely unnoticed by local media, Chakavian became a language which was officially recognised by the main international academic organisation that deals with the classification of all languages spoken by mankind. Chakavian thus received its own special ISO language ID code: ckm\n\nThis significant (at least linguistically) historical event paves the way for Chakavian speakers to receive much greater local and national recognition, which has been totally lacking until now because Chakavian was considered to merely be yet another dialect.\n\nAmerican professor of linguistics from the prestigious University of California, Kirk Miller, known in the academic world as a successful field linguist responsible for the research and popularisation of the lesser-known languages spoken by mankind, thought about the need to perpetuate Chakavian as one of the languages of our world.\n\nSeeing that nobody had remembered to classify and identify Chakavian as an official language, Miller himself decided to send a painstakingly thought out and written request on September the 2nd, 2019, for the recognition and documentation of the Chakavian language to an organisation called SIL International.\n\nThe Summer Institute of Linguistics International is the full name of an international non-profit organisation based in Dallas, Texas, whose main purpose is to study, develop and document all languages used throughout the world, with the aim of expanding linguistic knowledge, promoting literacy in all languages, and ensuring the language development of linguistic minorities.\n\nOnce a year, SIL International publishes the prestigious academic magazine *Ethnologue*. It is a reference publication available both in print and online that provides statistics and other information about the world's living languages. What is actually perhaps an even more important responsibility of SIL International is to issue ISO type 639-3 codes for comprehensive coverage on behalf of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO, based in Geneva - of which Croatia is a member).\n\nIt is interesting to note that Professor Miller based a part of his request on the previous request of the main association of speakers of the Kajkavian language, which already managed to win the recognition of Kajkavian as an independent language back in 2014. SIL International then recognised Kajkavian as an independent language, but only in the literary form that was used in the period from the 16th to the 19th century and in some works from the 20th century.\n\nMiller's entire argument was already confirmed as valid by SIL International back in 2020. Owing to his efforts, the Chakavian language was given the highest possible linguistic recognition that exists: it was recognised as a living (independent) language of its own, and not merely a dialect.\n\n**Who actually invented the word ''narjecje'' - the term the Croatian language mixes up with ''dialect''?**\n\nChakavian and Kajkavian have long been considered languages in the international world of linguistic science, and not a mere branch of the Croatian standard language, that is, the Shtokavian Croatian language as we know it. Of course, both languages are actually much older languages than the standardised version of Shtokavian (in the first few centuries, all Croatian dictionaries were actually written only in Chakavian), which continued to exist and develop even after the creation of that standard, so, they in fact cannot be dialects of that standard at all. Chakavian might even be considered an international language of sorts, because it is spoken in Croatia and in four other member states of the European Union (in Slovenia, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia).\n\nDespite this, former Yugoslavian (and later a significant number of Croatian linguists) placed both Chakavian and Kajkavian in the category of \"dialects\" (narjecje) for decades.\n\nThe very term \"narjecja\" has always been a disputed concept when it comes to linguistics outside the vague borders of the Balkans. It's enough to know that there is no direct translation for this word in any other language of the world, nor is there one for the concept that we encompass within that word. In international linguistics, only the terms \"language\", \"dialect\" and \"sub-dialect\" are known. That is why Croatian and ex Yugoslavian linguists were forced to invent a rough English translation for the word themselves - \"supradialect\" (i.e. super-dialect) - in the desire to explain to the whole world the local concept of something that has all the linguistic, social and historical characteristics of a language, but we for some reason or another have the need to consider less than a language.\n\nAs is often the case, this approach is the product of the fact that in Croatia, political circumstances heavily directed science, and it wasn't that science gave the main direction to politics: the Croatian people fought frantically for their place under the sun for almost a century and a half. Being recognised by the world as an independent national community required enormous effort, dogged determination and deep desire of more than six generations of Croats. That meant that entire generations of Chakavian and Kajkavian intellectuals and scientists preferred to neglect their mother tongue and native culture in favour of the greater good of the entire Croatian nation, of which they strongly felt a part throughout history. It was a logical and noble move at the time, but it has left its scars.\n\n**Language – the soul and heart of any culture**\n\n\"If a culture were a house, then language would be the key to the front door, and to all the rooms in it,'' says Khaled Hosseini, an American writer and doctor born in Afghanistan, who was also New York Times' bestseller three times.\n\nLanguage is indeed the very essence of culture, because its soul begins and ends with language. It shapes the way people think, dream, communicate with each other, build relationships and create a sense of community. It's the main guardian of a value system, because it directly transmits a set of symbols, meanings and norms.\n\nIt is that first form of communication with the universe, those first children's words that initiate verbal contact between people. Knowing one's linguistic roots so well automatically enables one to more easily identify with the community around them and to keep the welfare of that community close to their hearts in the deepest sense.\n\nLanguage is a technology that enhances and expands the capacities of categorisation that we share with those around us and those who came before us, and therefore plays a key role in the transmission of human culture to those who will come after us.\n\nAll of this of course also applies to that part of Croatia where Chakavian is the autochthonous language. Croatian culture will disappear when and if the languages on which it is based are lost to the hands of time. This isn't such an incredible possibility: if we continue with today's trends, it is quite likely that in two generations, Chakavian will more or less have the status of an extinct language. When it disappears, native Croatian culture will also disappear with it.\n\nUnfortunately, the statesmen and strategists of Croatia's national branding failed to use the independence of our country, nor the next three decades of freedom, to valorise the linguistic and cultural specificities of its native people. If the Republic of Croatia and its representatives believe that culture is at least somewhat important, then they will have to activate themselves and work much harder to promote the Chakavian (and Kajkavian) languages.\n\n**Chakavian's future**\n\nThis international recognition for the Chakavian speaking world is not only significant, but a truly epochal event. At the global level, the Chakavian language will be studied more seriously and more study and learning of the Chakavian language will be promoted at Slavic departments of universities outside of Croatian borders. A small boom in academic and non-academic literature on the Chakavian language is also to be expected over the next few years.\n\nBut above all, this brand new status will really open the door wide for Chakavian speakers to request official recognition of their language where it most needs to be recognised, that is, in the countries where Chakavians have lived for almost 1,500 years and maybe for even longer. It would indeed be a very sad and perversely ironic historical turning point if, after surviving all kinds of enemy invasions, legal prohibitions and changes in language fashions for at least twelve long and arduous centuries, the Chakavian language dies out precisely in the era of the first truly independent and free state of the Croatian people.\n\nThe international recognition of the Chakavian language and Croatia's next steps will thus surely become an important cultural factor on the European path of this proud little country and Croatian civilisation itself, because in Europe, local and minority languages have been lovingly nurtured for decades, and unique languages have some very efficiently (and profitably) regional and national brands built on them, and through these, the true respect of the people towards their local communities is promoted.\n\nAll municipalities and counties in which Chakavian is the original autochthonous language are now given the opportunity to recognise Chakavian at the very highest level, as a parity language alongside the standard one, and it is now the turn of Croatia to launch some proper initiatives and political guidelines to first preserve the language, and then to help the Chakavians to standardise it all to some extent and effectively promote it at both the local and global level.\n\nOf course, this requires a lot of work and the orchestrated multi-year work of all participants in the Chakavian speaking world, but the goal is a worthy one and one which is definitely achievable (especially with the help of all the instruments and means offered by the European Community for these purposes). If it is possible to revive languages that have completely died out in Cornwall and the Isle of Man under the constant pressure of the most heavily spoken language in the world (English), or to revive the unwritten Maori language in New Zealand, then reversing the negative trend of a language that is still fluently and daily used by hundreds of thousands of people in a modern European country can't be that hard at all. It only requires good will, diligence and, of course, love. Things that were never missing among Chakavian speakers.\n\nFrom: [https://www.total-croatia-news.com/lifestyle/66414-chakavian](https://www.total-croatia-news.com/lifestyle/66414-chakavian)",

        "text": "*The idea behind linguistic puzzles is to provide a snippet of information about a language or a group of languages, just enough for you to recognise patterns, formulate a hypothesis and solve the task, without any prior knowledge about the languages necessary. Have fun!*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Puzzle #1\n\n*(from web(dot)archive(dot)org, author not indicated)*\n\nYaqui is an American Indian language currently spoken by about 16,400 people in Northern Mexico and southern Arizona. It is a member of the Uto-Aztecan language family. This is one of the geographically most widespread language families in the Americas, extending from El Salvador (Pipil) to the state of Oregon (Northern Paiute), and from Southern California (Cahuilla, Luiseño and others) to Colorado (Ute). Nahuatl (see the classical Nahuatl puzzle) is another Uto-Aztecan language. Today there are many varieties of Nahuatl spoken in Mexico.\n\nThe following are eight emphatic sentences in the Yaqui language. Your task is to match the correct English translations, given below in random order, to each Yaqui sentence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Yaqui sentences**\n\n1. Inepo siika.\n\n2. Empo nee aniak.\n\n3. Inepo apo'ik aniak.\n\n4. Inepo apo'ik vichak.\n\n5. Inepo enchi vichak.\n\n6. Inepo enchi aniak.\n\n7. Empo ye'ek.\n\n8. Aapo enchi vichak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**English translations (in random order)**\n\nA. You helped me.  \nB. You danced.  \nC. I saw you.  \nD. I saw him.  \nE. I helped you.  \nF. I helped him.  \nG. He saw you.  \nH. I left.\n\n*Short answer:* &gt;!1H 2A 3F 4D 5C 6E 7B 8G!&lt;\n\n*My thinking:* &gt;!1) Phrases 1 and 7 have the simplest structure, with two words each. The two English translations with the same number of words are B and H. Since Inepo is repeated in five phrases, same as I in the translations, Inepo = I, meaning Empo = you.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2) Aapo/he is also obvious, since these appear in one phrase each. The same pair of phrases also gives us enchi = you and vichak = saw.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3) The only other phrase with you/empo is 2. Empo nee aniak/You helped me, giving us words for “me” and “helped”. This leaves only “apo’ik” for “him”.!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Puzzle #2\n\n*(by A.V. Nikulin)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuajiro (Wayuunaiki) is an Arawakan language spoken by more than 300,000 people in Venezuela and Columbia.\n\nGuajiro /j/ reads similar to /ch/ in “Loch Ness”; /ü/ is somewhat similar to /i/ in “bit”; /ch/ and /sh/ read the same as in English, and /‘/ is a consonant not present in English.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou have words in Guajiro with their translations. Some of the words are missing a letter.\n\nt\\_\\_kii (1) — my head\n\ntamüsain — my smoke\n\ntale’e — my stomach\n\ntejiikalain — my spoon\n\ntekepeinse — my coffee\n\nt\\_\\_sapain (2) — my knee\n\nt\\_\\_sima (3) — my bonfire\n\ntalimuunain — my lemon\n\nt\\_\\_miirua (4) — my younger sister\n\ntalaülashi — my boss\n\ntapalousain — my scissors\n\ntejepira — my finger\n\ntachü’ü — my kidney  \n t\\_\\_she’in (5) — my clothes\n\nt\\_\\_püliise (6) — my donkey\n\ntashi — my father\n\ntepiuunase — my slave\n\ntajapü — my hand\n\ntejimein — ma fish\n\ntasesein — my sieve\n\nt\\_\\_chikanain (7) — my footprint\n\ntasüla — my tendon\n\ntemeshu — my mother in law\n\ntache’e — my ear\n\nt\\_\\_sii (8) — my flower\n\nt\\_\\_peraawase (9) — my opossum\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFill in the gaps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Short answer:*\n\n&gt;!tekii (1), tasapain (2), tasima (3), temiirua (4), tashe’in (5), tapüliise (6), tachikanain (7), tasii (8), teperaawase (9)!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*My thinking:* &gt;!1) After sorting the words without gaps into ta- and te- groups, it’s immediately obvious that back consonants (/j/ and /k/) appear only after te-, while dentals (/l/, /s/, /ch/, and /sh/) appear only after ta-.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!2) Labials (/m/ and /p/) are present in both groups, but in the te- words they are always followed by either /i/ or /e/.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!3) Therefore, the rule seems to be “/te-/ only before back consonants or p/m + i/e”.!&lt;",

They found that heritage language speakers who are receiving monolingual education (in the mainstream language of their country) will have lower literacy skills in their heritage language. So a good way to improve their literacy abilities is having them read books about their heritage culture in the mainstream language and read books about the mainstream culture in their heritage language. Reading about a culture they are less knowledgeable on (their heritage culture due to the monolingual education they are receiving) would be too difficult in their weaker language (i.e. their heritage language again due to the monolingual education they are receiving) would be too difficult and frustrating. By switching the culture and the language of the books, these children can learn about their heritage culture in their stronger language and they can improve reading in their heritage language by making the content more familiar to them. \n\nI spent weeks searching for this article. If anyone could help me, I would really appreciate. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.",

        "text": "Hello. I am not a linguist and have no formal education in that field. However, I am fascinated by language as a cultural phenomenon.\n\nOne topic that has been constantly on my mind is the comparison between the acquisition of a native language/s and foreign ones.\n\nI wonder, what do studies conclude about this?\n\nAs an example, native speakers are usually considered to be of much higher proficiency than those who learned it as a foreign tongue. However, does that mean that one's native language holds a special place in the human brain? Is it, \"prioritised\" as the, \"default\" way of communication, or is, \"stored\" the same way as other languages?\n\nHave non-natives been found to be able to match the level of natives?\n\nAs an example, we can see plenty of cases of adults who spend decades in another country, surrounded by a foreign language, yet they retain a strong accent. Children need significantly less time to acquire a native accent in their first language.\n\nSo I wonder, is it proven that native speakers are inherently, \"superior\", to non-natives? Does the native language hold a special place in the brain? Is it treated as the, \"default\" by the brain?\n\nAlso, there are people with more than one native language, which is for instance common amongst Indians. How come they can speak two languages with no (foreign) accent, but an adult struggles to do the same thing?\n\nAlso, would it mayhaps be possible to acquire a native-level understanding of a closely related language? I am Polish. Would it be fairly easy for me to acquire a native-like understanding of Czech, as it is a closely related language with similar phonetics (as opposed to English or German)? Or does that bear no relation? If I already speak Polish, why shouldn't I be able to reach a level of fluency idential to that of a native in a closely related language?",

The wiki page for the patronymic naming system says that they take their fathers name as their surname, with 'ap' and 'ab' separating the two. I'm already a bit confused as to what the actual difference is between ap and ab or if there is any difference at all, but then I dug around for some actual names. For example, we have Gruffudd ap Cynan, son of Trahaearn ap Caradog, who didn't adopt Trahaearn's name at all and used a different surname. Then we have Gruffudd's son, Owain Gwynedd, who also didn't adopt his father's name and had a different type of name, and his next two successors adopted Owain's full name as their surname, for example, Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd and Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd. Looking at other examples, 'ab' also applies to single names, as well. Can anyone inform me of just how the naming system works in Wales?",
