The story centres on a cult of elemental chaos opening a portal to a dimension of, well, chaos, and the players' quest to infiltrate their fortress and stop the ritual. The published material is great when it comes to monster statistics and motivations for roleplaying, but is pretty light on the riddles and puzzle-solving. So I turn to you! Do you guys have any riddles having to do with air, earth, fire, or water that you would be willing to share?
