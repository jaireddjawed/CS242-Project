I was going to write a card with the information on it, but I thought forwarding the email would be safer so she doesn't lose it. So now I'm thinking I can write a riddle in the card that makes her check her email. But I'm not very good at that apparently. I will be with her and the rest of the family tomorrow morning so when she solves it, I can just forward the email to her. \n\nIf would be amazing if you all could help me out. \n\nThank you and Merry Christmas!

        "text": "Four men are kidnapped and buried up to their necks in a straight line facing the same direction with a wall between the third and fourth man. A man with a gun holds them hostage. He says to them, \"I've placed two white hats and two black hats on you. You cannot speak unless ONE of you can tell me what color hat YOU have on... You have as long as it takes\"\n\nThe men can only see what is in front of them. \n\nThe first man(in the back with a black cap) can see the two men(#2 and #3) in front of him and then the wall.\n\nThe second man(in the middle with a white cap) can see only the man in front of him(#3) and the wall.\n\nThe third man(in front of the wall with a black cap) can only see the wall\n\nAnd the fourth man (on the other side of the wall with a white cap) can only see off into the distance.\n\n\n\nB &gt; W &gt; B &gt; wall &gt; W\n------------------&gt;\n\n\n\nThe men do not know the order of the caps, but do know there are two of each color. They are forbidden to speak unless they are able to figure out the color hat they are pesonally are wearing.\n\nSo! Who can figure out what color hat they are personally wearing and how do they know for sure... \n\nHope this one isn't a repeat. It's one of my favorites, but I couldn't find it here. Good luck!\n\n\nIt's been solved! I hope you guys can try this one out on your families/friends over the holidays! it helps to draw picture!\n\n\nEdit: I should add this is not a trick riddle, if you were in this situation in real life this would be the only logical way to solve it! Feel free to ask any questions if you need anything clarified! :D",
