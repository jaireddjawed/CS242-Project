        "text": "Disclaimer: I realize this is a controversial and potentially inflammatory idea. My goal is not to antagonize anyone or work the mods to death. I'm not an activist and I don't necessarily know if I agree with the title or its assumptions. I invite you to examine any implicit assumptions I've made and also to call me names if you want.\n\n\nFull disclosure: I'm a white person. I live in a poor, urban, majority black area of a medium size east coast city. Everyone in my apartment building is likewise white. I'm apathetically liberal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI recently read an [article](http://newsacred.org/2016/06/so-you-say-youve-got-white-privilege-now-what/) by a woman named Marchaé Grair giving advice to white people wishing to \"ally\" themselves with black protestors. There are a lot of items on her list, but the last is obviously the most explosive and controversial:\n\n\n&gt; \"10. *Recognize that you’re still racist. No matter what*. Sometimes, anti-racist allies talk in an “us vs. them” framework when they discuss race, with the “us” being POC [people of color] and anti-racist allies and the “them” being racist people. That’s an oversimplification of centuries of racism, and it also avoids one simple truth. White people always benefit from institutionalized racism, no matter how anti-racist your ideologies may be. You can’t disconnect yourself completely from the racism from which you benefit, and recognizing that is a large step in rejecting white privilege.\"\n\n\nMy initial, visceral reaction to this was anger. On one hand I'm someone who *really tries* to be fair minded and live an examined life, I strive to put myself outside of things and be objective as possible. On the other hand I recognize the truth that racism is part of a historical continuum and I am cross-section of a time and place in which those issues may not be fully resolved, that perhaps I needed to humble myself more.\n\n\nWhat do you think?",

        "text": "For the past 5 days, medias are aghast with the outcome of the protest vote of the UK against the EU. I'm French, pro-Europe, center-left leaning, and was at first equally appaled. \n\nBut now that I see such gloom spread all over, I'm looking for positive opportunities that could arise from this shattering moment.\n\nEveryone seems keen on painting doomsday scenarii of a Venezuela-ized England and a slow destruction of the European fabric. Even the referendum winners seem embarrassed. \nNonetheless, the UK still has strong assets, an educated population and a cohesive economy. We know everything needs not fall apart.\n\nRather, this vote can be interpreted as a protest vote against the opaque, industry and finance-driven and red-tape filled agenda of the EU and the political elites of the continent.\n\nThe \"leave\" vote has parrallels accross Europe: the Podemos movement in Spain, Siriza in Greece, strikes against the employment law in France. The difference is that those movements are tamed, either because they are a minority (Spain, France), or because the ECB and IMF tie the Greek government. \nOnly here, this vote can not so easily be dismissed, no matter how many dream of doing it.\n\nIn the reddit hivemind, many are keen to bash on the influence of lobbies in Brussels, the raising inequalities, the administrative straightjacket EU legislation entails. I do have my share of anecdotes to share, in my interactions with EU research programmes (the most notable being a European Research Programme leader saying in 2008:  \"We *will* outpace Silicon Valley on innovation by outspending them!\"), or my farmer cousin admiting the success of his farm depends more on him keeping up with the paperwork than on tending to his crops.\n\nSo what if this vote could be used to tame some of the EU daemons we had come to see as necessary evils? \n\nHere are a few ideas that could gain traction:\n\n* ask for an elected representation at the EU commission, which the political elite does not want for fear of diluting their power.\n* better control the finance industry: whether it has to relocate on the continent or stays in London through renegotiated agreements, this is an opportunity for adding more controls, and rebalancing the power equilibrium in favor of middle classes.\n* weaken lobbying forces in Brussels, who can't dictate EU regulations as easily if countries threaten to leave.\n* tackling the third world refugees problem in a more unified way (and I don't mean by denying them asylum).\n\nOther ideas to find some possible positive outcome of this vote?",

Hitler, it was claimed, would have been laughed out of the beer hall if he had been British.\n\nThe Brexit result seems to counter that theory, and maybe the reason lies in the voting system.

        "text": "I've always wondered this. When I read the comments on the Steubenville rape case most of them were that the individuals should be tortured, raped in prison, or given harsher punishments to deter other rapists.\n\nThis made me think. Would this really work? I mean I've asked most people in my life if they would ever rape someone if it is legal and they say that it is \"abhorrent and disgusting\". The overwhelming majority of people in society would share that belief. Yet....Yet somehow we think that harsher punishments would deter those who think about rape.\n\nBasically what I'm saying is that we are essentially admitting that rapists must have a different thinking process by saying that they are \"animal like\", but if that was the case, why would a harsh punishment that isn't the reason the majority  don't commit crime work for someone who clearly isn't deterred by prison? \n\nThis isn't just about rape, but really any violent crime. IMHO, its obvious that most people whether they admit it or not, are driven primarily by the incentive to do better. Most people don't kill others because they value their relationships with others and also want to reciprocate basic rights between people. Most people don't rape because they do not want to be viewed as a monster by people who they have a relationship with.\n\nThis is why i think that anyone who doesn't have an incentive not  to commit crime  will not respond to punishment. \n\nA  minority kid living in a low income area who has poor social relationships with family, peers, teachers, adults, has poor grades, has poor eyesight who is constantly given detentions by their teachers and beaten by their parents will almost likely not care at all about threats of physical violence against them. They see life as already shit, and so far no one is helping them. \n\nWhat do you think about this?",

Some are accused of not being \"real men\" or rejecting their femininity.\n\nMy question is how can this make people uncomfortable as to hate on someone or think of them lowly.\n\nThe answer I've read from people online is that people don't like their belief of gender constructs being broken.

When I was younger I remember that being the \"gay side\" and I just can't get over the fact that a company would photoshop something so outdated into their ad to make them seem \"diverse\". It got me thinking about the use of token and minority characters in the media.\n\nI get that there are completely reasonable places to have minority characters. In Django Unchained, the fact that Django is black really drives the story. What about having a single minority in a situation where we don't normally see them (in the media, not real life)? Like the one woman in a sports film. Does it give us more room to be critical of their character? Maybe her decisions are more emotional than the decisions made by the men in the film. Or would questioning it just spur on the negative idea that we're only being so critical because she's a woman?\n\nThanks in advance for the answers!",

I know that hearing things like that does change things between people.  I'm just struggling myself to put my finger on why.\n\nIdeally, if a peer or kid asks what you make, you should be able to proudly say $350,000 a year or whatever.  If they ask how they can get that much, you tell them the path that you took to it, say that it seems like the free market will reward those skills in these ways, and they can make an educated decision on how to move forward with their life.\n\nHowever, it seems like what happens is a tacit assumption that the one making more is better or more ahead in life somehow.  So then the underlying assumption is that money is everything, and higher paying jobs are always more desirable, even if they're soul sucking?  Even though we hear countless quotes and sayings about how it's not and almost everyone would claim to the contrary?  Why does this happen?  Let's really break it down.",
