Keep in mind my guest system can't seem to detect my NVIDIA GPU so apparently it was training on CPU this whole time. Go figure. \n\nThe problem is on python I keep trying a million different modules, from mss to pyautogui to subprocess, etc., to do so and the screenshots all return a black screenshot saved in a folder as .png files. I tried changing them to .jpg but it made no difference. \n\nThe only thing that is working for me so far is manually taking a screenshot via alt+prntscrn but I need to automate this process. Pyautogui doesn't seem to be registering the keyboard inputs, probably because it uses virtual keys, and pydirectinput is incompatible with Linux. \n\nI also tried scrot both in terminal and subprocess in python but I keep getting black screenshots. I'll keep trying with different modules but I'm spending an embarrassing amount of time figuring this out. \n\nAnyone else have this issue?",

I am a music enthusiast and collecter, so my library grows over time. I have accumulated quite a surreal number of music files over the years (18k+). I initially used Audacious because it‚Äôs simple and fast, but I eventually got tired of manually doing everything. That is, creating m3u playlists, finding music using the file manager, creating mixes and the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sample artist albums](https://preview.redd.it/tirqvymt3eca1.png?width=995&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=691a4dd4573755ad1a915b7451e1473b6b4eb9d6)\n\nI started writing this music player project which brings together all my audio files (which are scattered all over my filesystem) into a single library. This makes finding and listening to music easy. The main idea is to have a simple and beautifully designed UI accompanied by tons of cool features to go with it. The app goes by the name **Swing** (formely alice). The app runs a server in the background and you can access the UI using a web browser.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI‚Äôm super excited to be announcing the first beta version üéâ. Check out [the release page](https://github.com/geoffrey45/swingmusic/releases/) on GitHub.\n\nHere are some of the main features that I have managed to build so far:\n\n* üìù Playlist management - Create, update and view playlists\n* üìÅ Folder view - Browser your filesystem and play music in folders\n* üíø Album view - View an album and it‚Äôs songs\n* üòÅ Artist view - View tracks, albums, singles &amp; EPs, appearances of the artist\n* üîç Search - Search through your library (fuzzy search supported)\n* ‚ù§ Favorites - Add an album, artist or a track to your favorites\n\nCheckout the screenshots on [this canvas](https://excalidraw.com/#json=b52G7e9g-dYhMmcyQy9El,pMWhoENuMZgC6mPgyMmU-g).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Sample playlist page banner](https://preview.redd.it/xpeko3wy3eca1.png?width=997&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5a68c2a2123cedf42ea54f90f8db9efd4663f677)\n\nThere are some pretty cool features which will be released in future releases. I have listed them down in [*this Notion page*](https://www.notion.so/Cool-features-1a0cd5b797904da687bec441e7c7aa19). Some of them are outright madness but some are really cool. If you have some cool features you might want to see in future releases, consider opening a suggestion issue *here*.\n\nThe app is currently available in beta for Linux at the moment. It will be coming to Windows soon (help wanted). You can get the app from the [Github release page](https://github.com/geoffrey45/swingmusic/releases/). If you encounter problems üêû, don‚Äôt hesitate to open an issue on the Github repo. Screenshots, logs and error messages are useful.\n\n## üõ† For developers\n\nI have been working on this project solo, so it‚Äôs very hard to push things fast. The app is written in Python for the backend and Vue3 for the client. If you have knowledge in any or both of this areas, feel free to contribute to the project. We‚Äôll be excited to have you. As always, your help is highly appreciated.\n\n# üìé Links:\n\nBackend GitHub repo: [https://github.com/geoffrey45/alice-core](https://github.com/geoffrey45/alice)\n\nClient Github repo: [https://github.com/geoffrey45/alice](https://github.com/geoffrey45/alice)\n\nIssues page: [https://github.com/geoffrey45/alice/issues](https://github.com/geoffrey45/alice/issues)\n\nThose cool features I was talking about: [https://rhetorical-othnielia-565.notion.site/Cool-features-1a0cd5b797904da687bec441e7c7aa19](https://rhetorical-othnielia-565.notion.site/Cool-features-1a0cd5b797904da687bec441e7c7aa19)\n\n## üòÉ About me\n\nHello there, I‚Äôm Mungai Njoroge.

        "text": "Righto. Rant time.  \n\n\nI'm in the process of overhauling my family's computer arrangement, following a bit of a disaster I won't go into for brevity's sake. Helping me with this is my 64 y.o mother.  \n\n\nMum is not your typical boomer. 20 years in medicine ending with a move into research and a PhD, she's now semi retired consulting part-time. Speaks 3 languages, has built her own websites,  and a month ago she installed GrapeheneOS on her own Pixel 6, with zero input from myself, just to 'see what it's like'. So naturally, we decided to get her started on Ubuntu. \n\nTwo days later, I get a call asking for help with  the ironically named Uncomplicated Firewall (she burst out laughing when I said that's what it stood for) . Naturally the first place google and most forums pointed her was the manpage - an utterly useless wall of en-masse arguments and jargon that fails to even explain to the new user that these are commends that have to be run in a terminal, much less how the command relates to any practical function in plain language:  \n\n\n&gt; *\"  For  the input and output rules, the interface is reported relative to the firewall system as an endpoint, whereas with route rules, the interface is reported relative to the direction packets flow through the firewall. \"*\n\n  \n...wut?   \n\n\nWho writes this, sits back, and thinks ' yep - that'll help someone get their printer working' ??? To paraphrase mums assessment -  what use is a 'manual page' if you have to know everything already just to be able to read it?  \n\n\nSo naturally, I just said  install GUFW from the Software store. Which, of course,  then immediately broke its own dependencies, along apt in its entirety.   \n\n\nThus began a week of genuine heartbreak, as we hopped from one community to another, distro to distro,  problem after problem, as watching her get worn down by thedysfunction and borderline  toxicity I think I've honestly just become desensitized to.  \n\n\nBecause itr's not just man-pages. It's EVERYWHERE. The wikis and doc archives are jumbled messes of generalized jargon, anywhere from two to ten years out of date.  Forums either get no replies, or answer your question with a more technical one, and *then* don't reply. StackExchange either picks on your gramare and edits you question into irrelevance, or gives you a dissertation on the history of the the problem that you'd need a CS degree to decipher, and reddit either throws dismissive one-line answers or  unexplained chunks of commands at you, tells you to use something even more obscure and complex, or argues the toss about whether  you even have a problem at all.   \n\n\nSome distros (which shall remain nameless) were far worse than others, but the pattern's the same - this gatekeeping that if you're not on 'our' level, you should just get there yourself, but not with any help from anywhere.  And hanging over it all, the ubiquitous 'open-source obligation' - no matter how broken, cumbersome or counterproductive, you should consider yourself lucky to be privileged enough to suffer at all.  \n\n\nI've  always known it, but never really appreciated it until I've watched firsthand as it completely strips any enthusiasm a newcomer might have for Linux -  not just as a useful tool, but as a *concept.* She's now skeptical of whether she should keep using Graphene and keeps asking if our routers or printers use Linux.   \n\n\nI've convinced them to still try Fedora, as a dual-boot - but honestly it has me wondering why I even bother myself.",
