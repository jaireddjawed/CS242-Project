I just was always really focused on school and was never into hook-up culture so I didn't put much effort into dating or anything and honestly just despise dating apps lol.\n\nAlso, I've been at home since COVID hit when I was 19 in college so since then everything has been remote (both schooling and work) and I live with my parents in the suburbs so there aren't many options.\n\nI never felt that I was lacking though. I think I learned a lot from relationships from hearing stories from my friends and seeing their interactions from an objective 3rd POV. I also learned a lot about what I want from relationships from movies, books, TV shows, etc so in a sense I do feel like I have experience. \n\nI do have a high sense of worth and value even though I never have gotten romantic attraction. I am happy with how I look and often get compliments for my appearance. I also am intelligent and have graduated top 10% of my class so I know I have value even if I have never been in my relationship. I have a strong sense of self and have built my confidence over the year. \n\nI am worried that people would not want to give me a chance since I am so inexperienced at my age. I was wondering if this has caused issues later on in life for people? I'm worried people well see me as immature or will think something is wrong with me. Do I be open about this once I start dating? And where can I meet people when there aren't many people my age around me? I'd appreciate any advice you have :)",

I had a conversation today that I am not happy about but am wondering if I am just now hypersensitive because of this. \n\nSo I have a young/lower level employee who I have talked with my boss about recently about letting her do more things on her own, without my hand holding, and specifically said we need to be patient with her and that she will make mistakes but she needs to learn through doing. \n\nToday she ran her first kick-off mtg and one of the things she didn’t do was a set of slides. The meeting was disorganized but it was due to a lot of other factors that had nothing to do with/wouldn’t have mattered whether she did slides or not.\n\nSo my boss calls me immediately after and asks me how I thought the meeting went. I told him I didn’t think it went very well and explained why, but I did not put the blame on my employee as I felt the disorganization was not due to the slides (although slides would have been nice to have).\n\nHe continued to put the blame on my employee in a more serious manner than I thought it warranted. I agreed slides would have helped, reminded him she’s still learning and is going to have hiccups, and said I’d talk to her about having slides next time.\n\nI am just not cool with how big of a deal he made about it, especially after I literally just talked to him about us needing to be patient with her. He also made remarks like “she’s college educated, can’t she read the [document] and do a slide.” Finally, I have seen grown ass men on our team run meetings WAY WORSE. Why is he beating up on a young kid (and me as her manager)???\n\nThis might be more of a rant than a question. Sorry.",

One of my friends had a baby two years ago and now preplans things months ahead.\n\nWhen I confronted them about it they said: “Oh, we thought we told you. Oh well, sorry then.” They later said it's no biggie and don't understand why I am so upset. We can meet together later somewhere else.\n\nIs it justified that I am upset? I mean, wouldn't anyone be? I can't imagine doing things like that with either of them behind the third person's back. My boyfriend thinks it's extremely shitty and that I deserve better.

The dissolution of that friend group was a bummer, but I appreciated the way this guy friend continued to show up in the ways I needed at that time. I did notice that he maintained community with men who showed really problematic views on social media which gave me pause, but other than that we were cool.\n\nFast forward to 5 or 6 months ago, we met up for an activity and then dinner and drinks. I had been dealing with a lot of anxiety about life and these ending friendships, but after exchanging stories about some former friends, I felt validated about my decision. To “celebrate”, I decided to get shot after shot with said friend. Our drunk asses end up roaming around our city and ending up at a hotel because we were not in a state to try to make our way home. \n\nOne of the last things I remember is taking off my pants to get into bed, but next thing I know I’m being penetrated and pulled to do sexual acts. I distinctly recall waking up the next morning to my guy friend inside of me.\n\nI went along with it, brushing it off in the moment as a wild night (with bad decisions on my part). We exchanged our typical goodbyes and went on our way. We even hung out twice since. \n\nUpon further reflection and a deep talk with my therapist, I realized that what happened that night, though irresponsible to myself on my part, was at the very least really not consensual and very not okay at all. (I’ve also been working to unpack my heavy alcohol usage and struggle with boundaries and risky behavior, something that’s shown itself long before this situation)\n\nBut now I’m puzzled about what to do next. This friend wants to connect again but I think it’s best we don’t hang out at all or continue to be friends. Ghosting feels cold, but telling him the reason I want to end the friendship could lead to a very bad reaction with social consequences on my part.

Or... Is there a way I can talk myself down from leaving it on at all?\n\nYes, therapist, I know, blah blah. I'm dealing with the VA medical system, so that's not an option currently. And I can't afford to see anyone with no outside insurance. \n\nAlso, the light in question isn't in my bedroom, it's in a room adjacent to, it shines enough that I feel better with it on, but a little too much to where I'm having trouble sleeping.",

I want to get into shape which means working out more, and I also want to be outside more hiking and kayaking. \n\nBut! I also want to finish the book I've been half assing the last five years. Oh!

That also goes hand in hand with the gardening thing. \n\nDid I mention I love to read and have a billion books I want to devour? That eats up a bit of time, same with video games! I also didn't mention I have a lovely dog who deserves to be played with and walked as much as possible.\n\nI'm learning a second language right now and want to increase my skill with that. I also kind of want to pick up an old instrument I used to play as a kid. \n\nSo with all this in my brain I generally feel unsure of where to even start.

Also, ever since, I don’t get invited to things anymore bc him and his friend are invited. \n\nSecond, she has MANY problems in her relationship and only calls me to cry about it and doesn’t even ask how I’m doing. Recently, she called to tell me she cheated on her bf! \n\nI was really disappointed to hear that and I don’t know I want to continue a friendship with someone that is so toxic in relationships. My current boyfriend would NEVER tell me to stop being friends with her but I know he doesn’t feel comfortable with me having a friendship with someone who doesn’t have the same values as me. \n\nI’m not sure what to do… the friendship honestly fizzled when she started dating her bf but we do occasionally hang out in our friend group… so do I just remove myself from the group altogether or just continue the acquaintance in a group setting? \n\nThey don’t know the things I know about her and her relationship… so I’m sure they wouldn’t understand why I want to remove myself from the friendship. \n\nIf I’m being 100% honest.

She didn't respond to texts or pick up the phone but she was constantly posting on Facebook. Her baby is 6 months old and I haven't seen him in person once. \n\nI had wished she didn't get pregnant partly because I'm not big on the whole baby thing, she's 18 and she'd probably ghost me when she gave birth. I told my mom this and she said I'm being selfish. If she never got pregnant she'd still be working at the same place and making the day slightly better by having someone there I like to talk to.

I got embarrassed by my mom's reaction so I started to teach myself where each country was situated on the world map &amp; learned their capital cities &amp; flags (might forgotten some cities by now but I can recognize any flag I see, most of the time at least). This was me trying to improve myself in the things that I lack, but there are certain things that I can't just change, like being NATURALLY smart &amp; quick in thinking or street smart. I wake up in the mornings most of the time having this feeling associated with a thought in the back of my mind that pinpoints how dumb I am or feel. I sometimes think if I'm a pain in the ass to someone due to how my mind functions.\n\nI also didn't pursue my master's degree in microbiology, only got my bachelor's, because I felt tired &amp; knew that I didn't like the field but mostly because I felt like a fraud &amp; didn't belong there amongst the smart ones (I also had huge anxiety just thinking about how I will fail at work, IF I would be accepted)\n\n\nDoes anyone of you feel something similar to my situation? I wish I can trade my looks with brains, at this point I just wish I could have a different mind that thinks faster &amp; understands deeper topics like politics or idk. I'm F btw 25.\n\nPPS. I also have a huge list of all the things/topics I want &amp; need to teach myself but that literally doesn't help with the morning-feeling I get, it's like I know I don't belong amongst the smart people category and I will never belong there no matter how book-smart I get if that makes sense. I wish I was built differently, I mostly find myself admiring extroverted, independent &amp; assertive women around me &amp; I compare myself with them &amp; then feel super inferior to them.",

I did lots of research, planned everything out, obsessed over it, and was certain nothing would prevent me from doing it. It’s been my main goal and all I was looking forward to especially during the winters. \nThen about 6 months ago I met the absolute love of my life.  I told him my plan a while into our relationship and he was definitely bummed but he also agrees that he doesn’t want me to regret not doing it down the line. Parents I know have always said to travel and live before you have kids and I’m running out of time. \nI am struggling now with this decision. I don’t want to leave him at all. He’s going to visit and I’ll come back to visit him but that’s a lot of money and effort. \nAnother issue is that I was planning on bringing my cat who is 13. I’d have to get her some vaccines and chipped which was already stressing me out since she’s older but when I was single I was planning to not come back. Now I’m not sure if it’s worth putting my cat through the move just to come back 8 months later. I don’t want to regret whatever decision I make. \nAny advice is appreciated!",

        "text": "Hello everyone, I'll get right to the point- I spent my 20s traveling the world and being a general vagabond, moved back the US and went to college at 29, bartended through school, graduated and just got my first corporate job in a big, fancy, stuffy city. The job is actually a dream job of sorts, or at least the entry level to it, and is in the field I just finished studying, so I want to do well at it. I am trying my best, but 5 weeks in and I am feeling some imposter syndrome.   \nI drive in in traffic, park in a creepy ass liminal space parking garage, go into a giant office building that is exactly the same as the one next to it (to the point that I have gone to my floor in the wrong building before, because even the elevator voice is identical), go up to the 14th floor, scan myself in, and have a whole day of fighting for my life in spreadsheets, going to meetings that I always leave with ten more things on my to do list, no one seems to be organized or on top of anything, I am still not sure exactly what my job is because so far I am just helping my superior put out fires from when the person I replaced quit. I feel like I am letting people down because I still need help with basically everything, but they are all very busy. Also, I was provided with a very old computer which did not work or allow me access to the cloud drives, which was a huge problem. I just was given a replacement less than a week ago, so I feel really behind from that as well. \n\nI know it will be easier in time, but I guess I'm having some culture shock. I have always had an alternative lifestyle, I have no kids, I am free spirited (but at as free spirited as a lot of the truly wild party people are), and I have worked remote jobs, artsy stuff, night shifts and events for the last decade.\n\nI'm not even totally sure what I am looking for, but if anyone can relate- I would love to hear some pointers for not sticking out like a sore thumb in the office and not feeling like I'm in a weird 70s  horror movie in the building. I imagine most people feel this kinda way when they are in their early 20s, but its not so cute at my age and I don't want to be the weird middle aged lady who doesn't know how to behave and needs help all the time but its annoying because I am not a cute 22 year old, and I should know what I'm doing. I guess I also just needed to vent. Any kind and constructive input would be great.",

Life's already been full of lotta ups and downs, it seems to me like I'm really having a happening life than my peers. Saw much worse things like my father being acquitted and sent to jail by police over false charges (They were bribed by a friend turned enemy of my father). I'd just say, my father is a noble, kind and generous person, and he never did wrong to anyone, in case you wanna judge. After a month we got him out on bail. \n\nHe lost all the wealth we had to our petty relatives and others, and fell into a huge debt trap. At this stage, we're not even at ground zero, having negative wealth, living on rent, with barely survivable income. We're a family of 5, my mother, father and two siblings, me being the eldest one. \n\nI see my parents getting old, and could feel that it's getting difficult to work for father day by day We can't really count on anyone except we 5, all relatives have become selfish and did a lot of bad to us, although we don't expect anything from them. \n\nThese all tragedies I've been witnessing since the last 5-6 years of my life. And to add cherry on the cake, I'm an effeminate gay guy in this almost homophobic country. \nAnd from here a lotta questions arise. \n\nI observe my friends, my relatives, people around me and I notice that although everybody has a lotta problem in their lives but at least they're able to get some occasional happiness. I feel different when I see peeps of my age visiting new places, partying, enjoying life, trying new hobbies, in short living their life and here I'm buried with a lotta responsibilities. I feel like I never lived my life, never enjoyed my own presence, never felt really happy, always lost in some thoughts, I've to look after my parents and education and everything of my siblings too. \n\nI'm stressed, and stress turns me off, I feel blank in stress, couldn't really process any thoughts. Currently in the last year of engineering and need to get a well paying job in the development field as soon as possible. And to add another cherry on the cake, I'm not really doing hard work to grab a good job. Dealing with chronic procrastination. \n\nNow my questions are, \nWhy me?\nWhy my family?\nWhy are only the good and nice people hanged? \nWhen my circumstances are gonna change? \n\nI feel like if my father would've been a little selfish then we would've been a multi millionaire by now and would've been living a stable life. \nSo, is this world only for those who're selfish and creep?\n\nEven the administration supported the wrongdoers, so when there's no one for innocent peeps, then why should I not become one of the wrongdoers too? \n\nWill I really be able to feel the happy emotion again? \nWhy there's literally no one to stand by my side? \nWhy is this world so cruel?\n\nAnd last but not the least. \nWhy am I still procrastinating and not working on changing my conditions? Provided, they're getting worse day by day.",

        "text": "So I don't really interact with this woman a lot, but I see her at work every few weeks. Without getting too specific (in case she ever sees this lol) my role is basically a support role for hers, so if I'm working in her area and she needs help, she calls me.\n\nAnyway, I've worked with her for a few years but I've noticed her getting friendlier with me. She's a bit shy, so I assumed she was just warming up to me. But I've noticed the last few times she's really tried to keep the conversation going. She's started to ask me a lot more personal questions and volunteer more personal information about herself as well. She also seems much more open to answering personal questions and gives me much more detail. Again, probably just friendly.\n\nThe other day one of my friends came up to help the both of us with something. We were waiting on another coworker to arrive to do the job so for about 15 minutes her and I were having a good talk. When we left my friend said \"She sure seems to like you.\" and I was like \"Yeah we talk sometimes. I know she's shy and a bit awkward but I think she's really nice.\" My friend says to me \"She's never once talked to me like that you know?\" I asked what he meant and he said that she's friendly enough to him, but doesn't seem to try to keep talking nearly as much as she does with me. When we got back to the break room and started talking about it, a few of the other guys said she doesn't talk to them very much either.\n\nPart of me is thinking that she is just being nice, and maybe she feels comfortable with me, because we both have kids (although my son is quite young and her son is a teenager). We seem to talk about kids and our families a lot lately, but again I kind of think that's just her being more comfortable with me.\n\nThe one thing that made me think ok, *maybe* is she's actually started laughing at my lame jokes. Maybe it's her sense of humor, but whenever I tease her a bit or say something kinda dumb she laughs at me. She's started making jokes with me now as well, which she never used to do.\n\nSo are we just progressing a friendship or is she signalling something to me? Is there a way to tell other than asking her out and potentially making things weird?",

I’ve been surprised when the topic has come up on Reddit how much people seem to resent receiving an apology from an ex/former bully/ family member. So many commenters will agree that they find apologies self-serving and if they got one they would be annoyed and ignore it.  \n\nI fully understand that apologizing doesn’t mean the other person has to forgive you or even respond positively. But I am surprised that more people don’t seem to appreciate it when someone acknowledges they treated them poorly, they were wrong, and they are sorry. I’ve received a few apologies in my life and in each case I felt validated in my feelings and afterwards found it much easier to let go of a difficult memory. The anger towards the other person pretty much evaporates instantly  and I am much happier not feeling bitter, so I don't find apologies self-serving. I think it takes character to acknowledge to someone that you behaved poorly and they deserved better. Some things are unforgiveable but even in those cases I imagine it would make me feel better to hear the other person acknowledge they acted like a POS. \n\nI’m curious how common my attitude of appreciating an apology vs. finding it self-serving and annoying is.

I can keep my dislike to myself and maintain professional boundaries. She is rude, condescending, exclusionary and does her best to be belittling when she can. I am doing a damn good job based on customer feedback and office manager feedback so she has no reason to be like she is other than maybe jealousy.

I don't live in the US for context so there is a cultural difference plus I don't trust any of them not to throw me under the bus if they want to. They're all permanent, I'm contract so I have to be careful as not being a suitable fit with staff is a termination clause in my contract. I do feel like I'm being othered for that reason too though.

        "text": "A recent post was regarding boundaries when inviting people over to your house and not wanting the invitees to invite other people over themselves without asking. What are your thoughts about etiquette when you invite a friend to hang out outside of your own home on neutral territory? \n\nLike if I want to meet at a park or winery, invite my one friend, and when confirming plans the day before or something she says by the way I'm bringing so and so. \n\nTo stay focused, I'd really only like your general opinion on the above, but here is more context for understanding:\n\nI generally dislike this, and it's been 20 years of friendship so the boundary setting thing is way past us. She also gets offended really easy so I just never bring it up. Really the more the merrier, but it does rub me the wrong way. She doesn't do this every time.\n\nSometimes I just want to hang one on one, other times it's because I'm not exactly friends with the person she invites along, but really I am introverted to an extent and would rather have a chance to get to deeper levels of conversation. Our convos are often surface level and she gossips about others a lot and it's harder to steer her toward more intimate conversation with someone else around.Things don't get that deep when we are one on one anyway, so I have definitely lowered my expectations of this particular relationship. \n\nNo, even after decades we might be \"best friends\" but we aren't close friends. Never have been. We are in our 30's and things have changed as she's matured, but not much.\n\nLastly, on the flipside, she has gotten offended in the past if I've gone to an event someone else invited *me* to and I didn't ask her to come with me. So there's something going on there with her and how she views friendships.\n\nTldr;  how do you feel when you extend an invite or plan a meetup/event outside of your own home and the person you invite frequently invites some other person along?",

        "text": "Hello! \n\nHoping to get some advice from you all!  \n\n\nI'm about to move in with a roommate (in one of North America's most $ cities). We're both exactly 30 and it's both our first time having roomies. I feel like we're on the same page on most matters, and both respectful and communicative.   \n\n\nBut we're stuck on the overnight visitors question. She said that she won't be dating, but will often have family (parents, siblings, cousins) visiting. I understand because she's close with her family, they want to see her in the new city, and accommodation is expensive. They are all nice people, but she has 6 siblings and dozens of cousins. On the same note, I likely won't be having overnight visitors. My friends and family are scattered across the world. They plan to visit, but my parents would book hotels/Airbnbs nearby, whereas most of my friends are partnered up and wouldn't want to impose on the roomie.   \n\n\nWe're looking at a 2-bedroom apartment (under 1000 square feet), with no den. We both WFH all days of the week, and agreed that the kitchen/living space can be our communal working spaces, since we both don't want to be stuck in our bedrooms working everyday. I wouldn't want to impose on their family time, if they're say, cooking/enjoying a meal together in the kitchen, and I need to ask them to be quiet. At the same time, I don't want to be stuck in my room all day when they're visiting (I prefer going out to cafes to work, but sometimes it doesn't work out when the cafes are noisy and crowded). I want to be comfortable in my own home, but also want her to feel comfortable in her own home. I also love having visitors and hosting people at home (whether family, friends, Couchsurfers), but I always capped it at a certain number of nights for guests—to have some breathing room (this was also when I lived in a larger apartment/house, not a cramped 2-bedroom).   \n\n\nMy questions are:   \n1. How many nights would be reasonable for you if your roomie had overnight visitors? She's thinking around 1-week stays maybe 4 times in the year. To me, that adds up to 1 month where I might be uncomfortable, but I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable.   \n2. She initially mentioned only sisters/mom will be visiting. But now, it seems like dad/brothers might be, too. Is it fair/reasonable to request for only female visitors? Nothing personal, but I wouldn't feel comfortable walking around in my jammies with her dad around.    \n3. Is it fair/reasonable to ask for only 1 guest at a time? I think having 4 people in a 2-bedroom would be way too cramped (especially if we're both WFH—I would feel the same way even if it's my own family!)   \n4. Is it fair to ask that their guest stay in their bedroom—and not crash on the couch?   \n4. If I'm away from the city, is it fair/reasonable to ask that my bedroom be off limits?   \n\n\nAny tips/experiences you might be able to share would be appreciated! TIA =)",

        "text": "I just hit my 20s early last month and in the past 6 months my body has gone through drastic changes. For context, I always grew up limiting the food intake I had because I was body dysmorphic and I never worked out because I have a blood condition that makes my stamina a little worse than others, and I also am really bad at hand eye coordination which I've been judged for - leading me to avoid sports with others entirely.\n\nAs of the past 6 months, through the help of my partner, I've decided to be more liberal with my eating. Instead of eating one meal a day or skipping a few, I'm eating 2-3 meals a day. I'm taking vitamins. I started running (although I've stopped the past month because of college reasons). I started taking birth control for my heavy periods. \n\nI developed deep dark stretch marks on the inside of my thighs, ( probably from the weight gain) on the outside of my thighs and my butt. The thing is I scar easily and they tend to not go away very quickly at all (a mosquito bite can leave a mark on me for a few months). My stretch marks are deep and dark, and they bother me a lot. I know my weight gain is healthy - I'm no longer bordering being underweight but I'm in the middle range of healthy weight for my height and age - but I can't shake the feeling that this weight is exponential and it won't end. \n\nFrom the birth control, I started having bad reactions to it so I stopped after 1 and a half months, but I noticed I also developed some minor spider veins on the outside of my thighs. I have some mild cellulite on top of this too (I'm guessing from the weight gain) and I'm not really coping well. My mom asks me why my legs have stretch marks if I've never been pregnant, knowing I always look too skinny. \n\nMy grandparents have both noticed my weight gain and told me I shouldn't eat too much because now I'm at a perfect weight and I shouldn't get fat. I understand where they come from - they don't want me to have a lot of health problems, not that they're really fatphobic - but it still makes me insecure. \n\nMy fat distribution has changed too - it used to just be my face, but now it's all going to my thighs, and no amount of exercise or running really seems to change that. \n\nI feel ugly. My legs feel so ugly. I break down because as much as I should be proud of my weight gain, I don't think I was mentally ready for it yet (being with my partner sometimes lets me gloss through all the body dysmorphia when it comes to food) . So now that I can see the changes on me, it scares me. I dont know if this is normal, to have spider veins, stretch marks and cellulite at 20 when just a year ago I had none of these things. I gained 6 kilograms (aka 13 llbs). I'm scared and feeling alone and need comfort.\n\nAny advice on how to deal?",

I recognize this stems from my need for alone time sometimes which I sadly realize, as I just try to keep up with shifting schedules, I have neglected for myself. \n\nI love my fiancée. He's my favorite person and I love being around him, truly, but I also recognize the need to carve out alone time for myself sometimes.

We were still indefinitely hybrid with no mandatory days. Therefore, I got an apartment where I have lots of friends and family. Rents were/are insanely expensive near NYC so it didn’t seem worth it to move back with the knowledge I had at the time.\n\nMy commute (public transport) is close to 2.5 hours one way door to door. Going in 2x per week from this location is not ideal, but I would suck it up as I work for a company that offers good pay and other great benefits. \n\nHowever, I can’t fathom 3 days. I’d lose over 15 hours of my life (not including waking up earlier to put on makeup and meal prep) and be spending an extra &gt;$100 each week. \n\nMy director also lives far away, and our weekly one on one is this afternoon.

I’ve gone to the office before, I’m not as productive there as it’s an open floor plan and the monitor setup is less than ideal vs my home office. The company email states it’s for culture, so it has nothing to do with productivity.\n\nHas anyone successfully navigated a conversation like this?",

        "text": "So I work in a tech company, not in a tech role. My boss is very friendly with one of the technical directors. He always comes to our team drinks etc and a lot of the work I do is ultimately for this director. He is married and 20 years or so older I’d say. \n\nHe’s always been overly friendly and a little bit flirty with me at drinks after work which is what it is. Things however seem to have escalated: \n\n- At a company work event, was drunk, asked me if I had a boyfriend (I did), told me he’d be much better in bed than my boyfriend, he’d make me finish x many times in a row, blah blah. He also told me I was the same height as his daughter (?). I left shortly afterwards. I reminded him he’s married and he said he doesn’t want to be married anymore and wants to find a 30 year old to **** (I’m not even 30) \n\n- Is extremely touchy with me at work but in an aggressive kind of way. Like he’ll come up to me and punch me in the shoulder, or sometimes he’ll grab my hand for a handshake but really squeeze it and hurt me. \n\n- I don’t think I flirt back with him for context. I feel like I either awkwardly laugh it off, ignore it, remind him i have a boyfriend or he’s married \n\n- He has really pushed the jokes over the line recently… like came up to me in front of work colleagues at the bar and asked if he could get me pregnant. I rolled my eyes and said “sure” because at this point what do I even say. The next week he asked how much would it cost to **** on my face. I was pretty shocked here and just said at least 50k. He said “oh well I don’t have 50k”. I said “yeah, I know, that is the point”. \n\n- I tried speaking to him directly 1.1 in the office about it to ask him to calm it down because it’s making me uncomfortable and now he’s totally ignoring me at work (which is making my actual job quite challenging) \n\n- My other concern is he is VERY friendly with my boss and I feel like it’ll be bad for my career if I report it. I tried to speak to my boss twice, once he said “I don’t wanna talk about this” and the other time he said “I’ve overheard many conversations between the TWO of you”.",

        "text": "I’m 33, living in a new city, going through a divorce. I’ve been trying to connect with new people — friends of my partner, Facebook groups, etc — but it feels so fake. Everyone’s conversations always feel like they’re straight out of an ice breaker randomizer even if they’ve known each other for years. \n\nAnyone who does want to have any sort of in-depth conversation is a man eager to love bomb. I’m over it. \n\nMy partner’s worried I’ll be lonely but these days being alone feels better than trying to force conversations with people I feel are putting me.",
