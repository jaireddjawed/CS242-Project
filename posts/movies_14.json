My taste in movies is pretty diverse, and all the elements of this film sounded promising, but dear god it was awful. My wife and I couldn’t get past the second fight scene. Then I tried (solo) to finish it and only made it another 20 minutes. My main issue is: Nobody in the film behaves/reacts the way a real human would if facing the same circumstances. Everyone is just…distractingly weird. So it’s hard for me to feel any drama when nobody seems human. I also hated the spastic style, and the nonstop weird slapstick humor. \n\nI get that we all have different tastes, but it baffles me how much adoration this film has received. And it just won Best Picture? I just don’t understand.\n\nMy wife was holding the remote when Harrison Ford opened the envelope. He got out the first syllable of “Every” and she turned it off.\n\nJust curious how many others are as equally baffled.",
