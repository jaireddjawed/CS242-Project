Anxious Preoccupied in Attachment Theory was a pretty accurate description of my behavior. I did have some abandonment issues coming up as well as being a middle child. Under the influence of alcohol for most of my life I could only endure the symptoms and side effects rather than work on any real solutions. \n\nStoicism has helped me by allowing me to see what I have control over as well as the values I assign to things and events. It\u2019s allowed to clearly see what is real versus what I assume. So much of my own misery has been self induced.\n\nThe last few weeks my wife has been sick. That is real. I had been fully aware of her illness and been attentive and caring and picking up the slack etc. No issues there. But in my head there has been a battle. Because my brain perceives her lack of attention to me as rejection. This is 100% internal. There is no drama etc between the wife and I about this perceived rejection. \n\nAfter weeks of perceived rejection, my wife recovers and the last few days has been noticeably better. Yesterday morning she sends me a very flirty and inviting text. And my brain, instead of being excited, heads straight to Resentment. \u201cWhy do I need to be ready at the drop of a dime when she\u2019s never there for me?\u201d\u2026\u201dtoo bad for her I have better things to do today\u2026.\u201d plays over and over in my head. \n\nBut instead of running away and sulking and compounding my misery and probably confusing the shit out of my wife I instead sat at my kitchen table and worked through it. \n\nAnd I used one of my favorite passages so far. Enchirdion 15\n\n\u201cRemember that you must behave as at a banquet. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand, and take a moderate share. Does it pass by you? Do not stop it. Is it not yet come? Do not yearn in desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. So with regard to children, wife, office, riches; and you will some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods. And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also. For, by thus doing, Diogenes and Heraclitus, and others like them, deservedly became divine, and were so recognized.\u201d\n\nI have recited this so many times since first reading it a few months ago. It\u2019s kept me from falling into negative spirals. Yesterday I could feel the pain being created inside of me and instead of letting it consume me I thought about it rationally. My wife was never rejecting me. My wife loves and cares for me. She wants and desires me. Just not when she\u2019s sick. Lol. Makes sense. \n\nSo I let the Resentment go. And the wife and I had a very enjoyable afternoon together.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678727890.0},{"title":"What are your theories on why stoicism is commonly associated with toxic masculinity?","author":"sophie-janek","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11q0t9f\/what_are_your_theories_on_why_stoicism_is\/","text":"I think the most common image that comes to the average person\u2019s mind when they think of a stoic is a cold, unfeeling military man or someone who looks down on others\u2014especially women\u2014for their supposedly emotional natures. \n\nWhat are the reasons for this cultural perception?

Honestly never even heard of it until recently when Ryan Holiday was a guest on 2 bears 1 cave, and long story short, that was my introduction, and here I am.\n\nI'm about 3\/4 of the way through Meditations (Gregory Hays translation) and several Ryan Holiday youtube views deep, and I feel overwhelmed with it all, tbh. I have had ZERO discipline my whole life. I blame my parents (my weak\/absent father and my mother who would never let me express myself), I blame myself, and my trauma from multiple sexual assaults I experienced from 11-13 years old, which led to depression, insecurities, and seeking the safest\/easiest\/laziest ways... I was quiet about the sexual assaults until covid happened, and my depression got worse. My wife and I were trying for our first kid I couldn't keep it in any longer, and I finally told her about it as well as my family. A huge weight was lifted for sure, but now it felt like I was starting life all over and figuring out who I was. Daunting and just, overall, very difficult.\n\nAnyways, fast forward a couple of years...I'm  37, and we have an amazing and healthy 2-year-old boy now .... but I'm stuck in my ways and wired to be lazy and have no discipline, so here I am trying to rewire myself, and it's overwhelming, on top of the stress that comes with being a first-time parent. Everything I'm reading and watching on stoicism resonates with me deeply, it almost feels like it's all just slapping me in the face, and I'm learning how shitty, lazy, and weak I really am. It's like being called out over and over, finally. It's a lot, but I'm here for it.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, I started setting my alarm for 5 am. I get up, brush my teeth, drink water, meditate, write, read then walk (2-3 miles). I'm done by 6:45, which is when my boy usually wakes up. It's a good feeling, but it's still challenging for me. I have trouble meditating and writing, my mind wanders off nonstop, and when I write, all I can think of is negative stuff to beat myself up over. I'm having trouble implementing all of the things I'm reading and learning about stoicism. It's like I will read about it and get all pumped up about what I'm learning, but then what? I go back to my negative ways of thinking, I get stressed and frustrated over stuff out of my control, I still lose my temper sometimes, and I'm patient, etc., you name it.\n\nI'm stuck in this endless anxiety-induced loop. It's almost like I'm racing to the finish line to fix all of myself and get my shit together asap so I can be a better example for my son once he gets older and starts to pick up on my actions and behavior. I'm trying so hard to break the cycle. My flaws and shitty attributes mirror my father, and I can't let this cycle continue and rub off on my son.\n\nI'm unsure what I'm asking here besides help\/guidance. I really wish I had a local mentor or someone to help guide me. I'm doing all of this on my own, my wife also has no discipline, and she doesn't like change and is super stubborn and set in her ways, so it's just really lonely... and I don't feel good enough to do any of this and don't know HOW to do any of this. I stress eat a lot, and I watch porn almost daily to get some kind of dopamine fix. Those are the two bad habits I can't seem to stop doing. I quick social media a few weeks ago, which has been helpful...I just still feel super lost, and it's fucking hard.

Whenever someone wrongs me, lies to me, manipulates me and attacks me I feel particularly upset because I never believe it is warranted for any reason. Essentially I believe these kinds of things shouldn't happen to me because I try my best to treat everyone with respect and kindness. I always try my best to do the right thing, ergo I don't deserve people doing shitty things to me. Part of it is also that I consider myself to be a very 'good' person (sorry but I do), so when someone does shitty things to me I'm thinking 'how could you do that to someone who has only ever showed you kindness?'. And I start to think less and less of the people around me who are so comfortable taking advantage of kind souls. I start to think less and less of my fellow man. I'm a much less trusting person now than I used to be, which I think is correct I feel like I'm becoming less na\u00efve. \n\nI don't really believe in 'good' or 'bad' (hence why I wrote 'good' and not good). I do believe in healthy and hurt people though. However, I still don't think people have the right to treat me like shit, so now I initially treat people with kindness, but if someone wrongs me I start treating them the way they treat me, which I think is only fair. I feel like people are exploiting me through my virtue, they know I'll never insult them back so they feel free to call me whatever. They know I won't fight so they feel free to treat me however they'd like. \n\nI feel like I'm not dealing with this in the right way, maybe I'm hurt from being hurt a few times.

I've been practicing stoicism for a while now. Just recently I discovered that constantly trying to be the better person is sometimes wearing me out. I mean, I do the right thing and that's what truly matters. No externals, just what I do and how I react. Perfectly agree. However, there inevitably comes a time when you have to deal with difficult people. You do the right thing yet it doesn't feel good. The question \"Why do I always have to be the better person?\" comes to mind. I mean, it makes perfect sense to only seek to act right and not want people to act differently yet sometimes I am left with pain instead of contentment. I sometimes feel like being the better person does me more harm than good. So, how does a stoic manage to overcome this impediment?\nIll give you an example. A former friend of mine and I were at a gathering. I accidentally broke an object of his. I tried to do the right thing so I apologized and tried to find a way to make it right. He started cursing at me for a long time which made me upset - at the moment I could not focus on my training and I got overwhelmed by my negative emotions. - I was disappointed and angry. Later on, he apologized and said he was mad because my apology did not feel genuine. I explained to him that I was indeed very sorry however besides apologizing and actually doing something to fix the situation there is very little I could ve said or done to make my apology better or more valuable. I acknowledged I upset him and he reacted emotionally - I then apologized, offered to pay for the object or even get a replacement. He expected me to be more dramatic or emotional, which I wasn't. Although I know that how I react is the only thing within my control, I still feel slightly angry. I feel like I have wronged myself for not giving him the same treatment. I feel like I am getting tired of being the better person.\nSo, how would a stoic overcome this?","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678575189.0},{"title":"Senecas letters question","author":"BarryMDingle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11pic8n\/senecas_letters_question\/","text":"I have just received the Dover Thrift Edition and it contains The Shortness of Life.

I am tempering my passions, I live modestly, I engage in hobbies for my betterment, and for the betterment of my fellow man. I entreat with people justly, respectfully, and equitably. \n\nBut I have lost my purpose. I had a purpose before, a job that I was looking forward to, but without discussing the details, now I am paid to sit around for a few months before I will have to come to a decision as to my future. And it is difficult to stay Stoic and build upon your virtues when I feel like a ship adrift with no course. To continue the metaphor: my crew is working, the sails are flying, the rigging is taut, the deck is swabbed, but to where I head I do not know.\n\nNow there are options. But how does Stoicism discuss the concept of decisions? How can we use Stoicism to determine what path suits us best? None of these options are objectively good or bad; they have pros and cons. But there is no weighing them because they are so vastly different and unknowable, especially without knowing just what it is I actually *want.* \n\nMy personal feelings right now are that the teachings of Stoicism have equipped me to handle situations of immense, immediate stress, and to be an effective leader, and to know how to continue moving towards my singular goals, when I had them. But now I have no unifying goal or path. Perhaps it is patience that I'm lacking? \n\nMy issues of course are compounded by sitting around doing nothing but my hobbies, and with limited ability to socialize considering I just moved to a new place.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678593862.0},{"title":"Is it Good feel Desire by Prefered Indiferent?","author":"reto0110","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11ouhta\/is_it_good_feel_desire_by_prefered_indiferent\/","text":"Recently, I read issue #43 of The Stoic Philosopher, about Roles (Enchiridion 17)  and I enjoyed it.

I would like to share my story about why I came to follow Stoicisms principles in my daily life. \n\nI come from one of the worlds most secular countries, meaning that faith wasn't something I grew up with. It wasn't common to go to church unless it was Christmas, and even then it was something cozy to do and not a reminder of Jesus' birth. Since I lacked a faith, my perception on death was that I was going to disappear after I die and I came to this conclusion when I was fairly young. Since dying meant that I ceased to exist I started to fear it, I didn't want to stop existing and experience new things. \n\nOver the years my fear grew, and I thought about death everyday. I had regular panic attacks where I felt like I couldn't breath and I had to stop everything I was doing to retake control of my mind. I tried to reduce my fear, by seeking religion and trying to find meaning in death. Since I had no others to share my faith with I started to lose it, I didn't find it logical to live forever in a kingdom above. \n\nSo my fear of death returned, and the panic attacks followed after it. One day I came across Stoicism, I found it interesting with it's viewpoint of ones character, how to be in control of your thoughts and emotion, but I found the most interesting thing to be the viewpoint of death.\n\nIn stoicism death should be a reminder of ones mortality, a reminder I've already had as long as I could remember. But stoicism has a different viewpoint from the one I had. Death brings meaning to life instead of destroying it, without death we could do everything in the world and everything would become boring. Why visit a country this summer if you know you could do it in 80 years? Why should you be kind when you know that you have all the time in the world to rebuild a lost relationship? With the latin phrase \"Memento Mori\", meaning \"Remember that you must die\", I began to understand that the reminder of death is to live life and not waste it. \n\nLastly I learnt from Seneca that if I lived my life to the fullest everyday I wouldn't mind dying. For in that case I would have done everything I could with the cards I've been dealt and could die in peace. This revelation decreased my fear of death, from the point of having panic attacks every week to having none. Today I don't fear death, I fear not taking action in life and living to the fullest. \n\nLast summer I tattooed the \"Memento Mori\" phrase on my chest as a constant reminder when I woke up and looked in the mirror, to live life and take action so that I wouldn't regret a thing once my time had come.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678552026.0},{"title":"I got blackmail scammed","author":"HaveSomeBean","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11oeeo9\/i_got_blackmail_scammed\/","text":"Yeah so I\u2019ll admit.

She started to throw up and wouldn\u2019t barely eat or keep food down the day before yesterday and began walking strangely again. \n\nWe called the vet and took her in yesterday and they did blood work. I was expecting them to just say that she needed to rest and not walk and that maybe she was throwing up because of the pain from her hip but the vet told us that she has kidney failure and has at most a few weeks left. They gave her a subcutaneous IV to help her body flush out toxins and today we took her at 7 AM to receive IV fluid until 5 pm. We give her medicine so she can eat without throwing up. I have to carry her occasionally this week because she has trouble walking. \n\nAll of yesterday I had the worst headache I\u2019ve had in while and yesterday i was crying all day as well and also today. Today when we picked her up from the vet she was able to eat and ate some fish as well as some special food they gave us for her. I cuddled with her for a while and she was a bit better so I tried to play with her using a new squeaky toy I had bought a few weeks ago that she really likes but she wasn\u2019t interested. \n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to believe that she is dying. She was wagging her tail when I woke up on the first day we took her to the vet and it doesn\u2019t make sense. I knew she was old but 3 years ago i told myself she had 3 more years and this past year i knew she was old but I figured she has maybe a few more years left because we were going to the park and playing and she would chase me with her toys like she did when she was a puppy. \n\nI feel very bad as well because I would swat her ears occasionally when she would do things like scratch the floor tiles up or pee without trying to go outside. Sometimes i would hit her as well and I kept telling myself that I need to stop and find a better way to instruct her how to behave. Sometimes I would scream at her as well. I feel so guilty and I cant even accept that I treated her this way. I feel like I can\u2019t even breathe properly when i think about it. \n\nI also regret not taking her more places. There was one park I found that i would take her to and we would run around and she would chase me with her toy or we would play fetch and walk and just chill at where I stopped taking her because a lot of stray dogs started hanging out there and barking at us. The last time I took her was not since maybe December? If not longer. I used to take her for a walk around the neighborhood at night just us two before there was a stray dog that tried to attack me as well. At my previous house we would walk to the park and we would stay there for hours and now I waited too long to be able to do that anymore. \n\nToday my mom showed me pictures of her when she was around 1 years old and i was 11 and I felt like I can\u2019t describe how guilty I feel for not giving her a better life or for being mean to her. I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe looking at the picture and I felt so freaked out . I wish I could redo it all. I wish I could at least go back 3-4 years ago. Ever since I moved into my apartment here without a backyard I\u2019ve seen her wag her tail nearly every morning for the past 3 years when I woke up and I would give her eggs and sometimes I would make her chicken.\n\nI\u2019ve been so caught up in my own depression as well and I still haven\u2019t processed things that have happened in my life before this.I wasn\u2019t barely even present in the moment with her especially since coronavirus began. \n\nI can\u2019t accept that she is leaving and I didn\u2019t do good enough and today i felt like I could throw up from how i felt. I\u2019m laying in bed and I keep crying. Right now she is asleep because of the anti nausea medication. \n\nI lost another dog when I was 10 after having her two years and it was difficult but this feels unbearable and I\u2019ve had family members including my grandmother die but for some reason this is just eating me up. I feel like i failed my responsibility to take care of her properly. I feel like besides my mother there is no one to experience it with me or experience the way I am. I feel like I was a bad owner and that I didn\u2019t deserve her. I can\u2019t stop crying and I feel like I can\u2019t do much of anything either.

I never did it before, and knew I am not ready. My partner treated me amazingly that night, and I had a realization I could really fall in love, since we had much in common. Afterwards, my partner flaked on me, didn't pay me much attention and ghosted me, we can say. Gave me multiple signs of no interest to pursue something, and after my effort to see if there was a chance, started suggesting only having sex, but never straightforwardly and still keeping the options of spending time together open ( tho it never happened). They never said openly said that they want a FWB only and when directly asked if they like me, didn't answer the question. To this day I don't have an answer. We met two additional times after that, and had again sex but also  great conversations, and once we met on the street and had a very nice walk for like 3 hrs. But they got into a relationship with sb a week after meeting with me last time, and are posting pictures together often now. \n\nI had many signs that showed me this person is keeping me at arm's length. \nI had them mistreat me by ignoring, avoiding, not being responsible and responsive, not giving me enough love that I require from a partner.

I went on with this, and tbh, I feel if they came back somehow I would navigate again a way to keep them around.

I'm currently 19 and no part of me wants to live anymore. I can't even speak my mind without Reddit banning my account or cops coming to my door for a welfare check. I'm fucking done. \n\nI get random phone calls from family and friends yelling at me saying it's all in my head and my symtoms are fake just about 3-4x a week. I've gone into extreme debt (about 3-4 grand) trying different things, because medical insurance in minnesota is complete shit and doesn't cover anything.\n\nWith going into extreme doubt you'd need a good paying job that you can't get anywhere else right? Correct!! That's what I have, and I'm about to get fired for 'slacking' although I have doctors notes on file with accommodations listed. Does that matter? No? Why would it? These motherfukers think I wasted 7 years of my life trying 164 different medications, and years of physical therapy \/ talk therapy sessions. Just to slack here and there at work. What a bunch of idiots. \n\nI'm suicidal all day everyday. If I tell my mother she laughs and says yeah right or she'll sometimes say \"go right ahead you're only effecting your life, I really can't stop you\" I thought well.. that's just one person. What do you do when no one wants to hear your crys for help? Oh that's right!! Pay for therapy!! \n\nFirst therapist I had for about 1-2 months and this emo asshole didn't know shit about anything, the worst thing she could relate to me with was about not doing well in school. (I dropped out from pure pain, I would have loved to graduate with my friends, but instead I look like the idiot who couldn't pass school) anyways she couldn't relate to me so whatever, I got a new therapist.\n\nThis bitch was even worse.. she was some bratty chick who looked no older then me. And the whole time she just tried to relate to me, but it completely came off as self centered and more like she wanted to talk about herself, which is fine whatever she can fuck off. So I decided mannnn, I need someone who's been through pain! So I found the toughest looking male therapist available to me, waited months and months. FINALLY he had an opening, I took it. I could finally open up to someone who understood!!\n\nI tell this guy hey man listen.. give him the brief rundown of how I love my self but hate my life. And he tells me to go more in detail so I start crying and telling this guy how suicidal I actually am. I told him how if I go out to eat I stare at my food until it's freezing cold just zoned out picturing my own death. And how sometimes if I'm driving I'll completely lose my vision to a day dream and just be stuck in this deep deep dark hell hole of negative thoughts. I told him how the shower is the scariest thing I can endure cause not only is the white noise perfect for a suicidal brain. It's also extremely painful on all my muscles and [all my other horrible problems](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/nyBTjuT). I can't even wash my hair without breaking down into almost tears because it's hurts so damn bad on my traps \/ suboccipital.\n\nI've gotten to a point where I've basically studied the whole human body in hopes of finding absolutely anything. Ive tried waking up early \/ going to bed early and getting good sleep, I've tried pillows ranging from $8-$130, I've tried months and months of physical therapy, I've tried months of talk therapy (basically lying the whole time so the welfare check doesn't happen, it's the same old loop), I've tried weekly adjustments for months trying to fix my curve, I've tried drinking a gallon of water a day for almost 3 years now, I've tried running miles a day, strength training, tried cutting out sugar for 9 months, completely quit my nicotine addiction (10 months clean), basically stopped smoking weed all together it makes me less suicidal, but makes my head hurt so much worse. I've tried a ton of different diets (haven't tried carnivores diet yet that's my next), I've tried over 160 different medications including injections (emgality, ajovy), nerve blocks, roid injections, I mean you fucking name it.. if it's from planet earth I've tried it! \n\nNow I've only been trying this consistently for about a week now but to no avail. I saw a ton of comments on my last post about \"Pain Free You\" on YouTube or Dr Sarnos, explains TMS and how your mind can create medical conditions. I'm not saying I don't believe it... but I bought the dudes fuckin book and everything. I said fuck okay I got muscle knots that just won't go away, I flew to an adhesion specialist and to my surprise I had adhesion I was like this might be it... fast forward 2 thousand dollars in debt later all my adhesion was removed and I feel the same. [try dealing with this at 19 years old with no support system wether that be friends or family not to mention no financial support](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/nyBTjuT)\n\nNo one wants to be friends because they don't wanna be around sickness or negativity. No family wants to talk because they are assholes and call me selfish when I bring up my pain. And the only ever support I ever had was a girl I dated for 3 years that cheated on me with my best friend and cousin for months without me knowing. Life is so extremely mundane when activities are so limited and to make matters worse my [ADHD & OCD](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9VsONgK) makes it impossible for me not to be bored, since I need to constantly be stimulated. \n\nMy life fucking sucks. \n\n\nTLDR: 19M, Life has gotten to the point where death seems like the only viable option to enjoy. I can't even look down for a few seconds without a migraine, and the only thing that makes me less suicidal makes my pain worse.

These stories, however gratifying to create, are inherently misleading. They lead to a sense of cohesion and certainty that isn't real.\nIf that's too heady, remember that as Epictetus points out, there is another reason not to tell stories about your past. It's boring, annoying, and self-absorbed. It might make you feel good to dominate the conversation and make it all about you, but how do you think it is for everyone else? Do you think people are really enjoying the highlights of your high school football days?

I find myself doing it too much I guess, where many things people say remind me of stories about myself that I just can\u2019t wait to share.

I believe that we should only concern ourselves with what we can control, and I think the pursuit of virtue is the key to a good life.\n\n\nHowever, I believe virtue is only good in that it brings happiness\/eudaimonia.  If I continue to ask \"why?\" regarding ethics, it always leads me back to good or bad feelings within conscious beings.\n\n\nFrom an epistemological standpoint, all that I truly know is what goes on in my own head.  The entirety of the outside world could be an illusion, a la the \"Brain in a Vat.\"  But I can feel my personal experience, and I perceive some things as good and some things as bad.\n\n\nSo when determining what is good or bad, all I can say for certain is that I experience thoughts and feelings which can be good, bad, or neutral.  Since good things are definitionally good and bad things are definitionally bad, I don't think any further explanation is required.\n\n\nExtrapolating beyond my personal experience, I am surrounded by other beings which appear conscious, and I don't have any good reason to believe I'm actually just a brain in a vat, so it follows that I should also value other beings experiencing good things (on top of the fact that I naturally experience empathy towards others).\n\n\nNow, this is a particularly un-stoic line of thinking.  Stoics teach that we shouldn't attach value to feeling good or bad, and in fact only virtue has value.\n\n\nDespite what I said earlier, I do think this is probably the best way to approach life.  The pursuit of happiness generally does not lead to happiness.  Virtue and meaning are key aspects of a flourishing life--we care about others and feel peace when we have good character.  By accepting what we cannot control and focusing on what we can control, we minimize distress and improve how we live our lives.\n\n\nBut all of these defenses of virtue are only due to extrinsic reasons--virtue leads to better lives for ourselves and those around us.  I've yet to see an explanation for virtue as an intrinsic good that really makes sense to me.\n\n\nThe Stoics invoked determinism and \"nature\" a lot.  Per the FAQ, they treated what is virtuous as \"obvious.\"  I'm agnostic towards determinism, and I don't understand why virtue is so obviously a good thing outside of it leading to better lives and more happiness.\n\n\nHonestly, I'm beginning to feel like we are trying to trick ourselves by deeming virtue intrinsically valuable.  As I said earlier, I think pursuing happiness directly is a futile effort, so I suppose it follows that one should disregard happiness and pursue virtue, which produces happiness as a byproduct.  I'm fine with this in practice, but when I sit down and analyze these things at their core, it all leads back to happiness.\n\n\nTo summarize, I'm perfectly fine with Stoicism and pursuing virtue as a guide to living a good life.  I think this is compatible with the idea that virtue is only extrinsically valuable, and I'm even fine with disregarding happiness despite rationally considering it the \"bottom line.\"  But I can't rationally square the idea that happiness has no value and only virtue is good, and since this seems to be the attitude of the actual Stoics, I wanted to see if there are any good counterarguments that would convince me otherwise.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1677945330.0},{"title":"What makes a person a stoic in like a chemical way in the mind\/brains?","author":"Xyzlerr","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11hj5zk\/what_makes_a_person_a_stoic_in_like_a_chemical\/","text":"I feel like I didn\u2019t choose to be a stoic and I just am one. that made me wonder is there\u2019s a explanation for it","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677887358.0},{"title":"\"Everything is for the good\"","author":"AKevic","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11i96jk\/everything_is_for_the_good\/","text":"We all know the phrase \"everything is for the best\".

(it's a good one, called More To That. check it out if you want) and I liked it!\nIn the end the writer mentioned that the text(and drawings! yes it includes little cute drawings too) is inspired by a letter by Seneca to Lucilius; so I looked it up and found out there are a set of letters that Seneca wrote (actually they're more likely just articles in the form of a letter, to a likely fictional audience called Lucilius, since there's almost no evidence of such person other than these letters). apparently Epicurus also wrote sometimes im the form of letters.\nI started reading and introduction and I believe this is my second stoic-related book. The titles of the letters are so straightforward and interesting, this is the first letter which is a short one:\n\n> Do that, dear Lucilius: assert your own freedom. Gather and guard the time that until now was being taken from you, or was stolen from you, or that slipped away. Convince yourself that what I write is true: some moments are snatched from us, some are filched, and some just vanish. But no loss is as shameful as the one that comes about through carelessness. Take a close look, and you will see that when we are not doing well, most of life slips away from us; when we are inactive, much of it-but when we are inattentive, we miss it all. Can you show me even one person who sets a price on his time, who knows the worth of a day, who realizes that every day is a day when he is dying? In fact, we are wrong to think that death lies ahead: much of it has passed us by already, for all our past life is in the grip of death. And so, dear Lucilius, do what your letter says you are doing: embrace every hour. If you lay hands on today, you will find you are less dependent on tomorrow. While you delay, life speeds on by. Everything we have belongs to others, Lucilius; time alone is ours. Nature has put us in possession of this one thing, this fleeting, slippery thing and anyone who wants to can dispossess us. Such is the foolishness of mortal beings: when they borrow the smallest, cheapest items, such as can easily be replaced, they acknowledge the debt, but no one considers himself indebted for taking up our time.

Unfortunately the website on which it is hosted ([TheConversation.com](https:\/\/TheConversation.com)) does not allow comments on this article, how ironic. So this will have to suffice. I will also send a link to this post to the author because I am open for debate and would love to get a response. I will go through the article step by step, and try to find the errors in it, as others in this sub have already done.\n\n\\------------- **Main Arguments** \\-------------\n\n>\"We want to demonstrate the usefulness of philosophy to everyday life. Most philosophers and philosophies fail to do this.\"\n\nLets see if he can demonstrate the usefulness (or rather UN-usefulness) of stoicism than.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"For a Stoic, it turns out there are very few things you can control. \\[...\\] we can control just three things: 1. our character, 2. our reactions \\[\u2026\\] 3. and how we treat others. \\[...\\] I have an issue with this. First, there are lots of things out there in the real world I can control. I can control my motor vehicle when I drive to the shops. Or, when I sit out on my back deck on Sunday evenings, I can control the fire in the fire pit.\"\n\nCan one really believe that he is in full control of the events when driving his car, or controlling fire? If so, why do car-crashes happen? Why do people miss their exist and go somewhere else. If you are in control there would be a 100% chance, that if you enter a car and want to go to point A, that you will end up at point A. This is not the case. Yes I can control my steering, I can control if I drive recklessly, I can control if I put a new log on the fire. As Epictetus says \"Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.\" That last part is important, we can't control what is not our own action. I can't control if someone doesn't stop at a red-light and hits me, I can't control if my car malfunctions resulting in me crashing it. I can go on and on about things that are outside our control when we are driving a car. That's where stoicism has to take over. Yes I want to get to the shop, yes I can be cautious about my driving and control my speed, but inevitably I can't (fully) control if I ever get to the shop.If something stops me from doing so I will have to work with what I am given, and that's the control about how I view the situation and react to it. I can use the stoic discipline of desire to accept what happened and not get angry when the car breaks down (not in my control). I can use the stoic discipline of assent to think about my reactions to this, and if this actually is a inherently good or bad. Is it bad that it broke down, was I harmed? Not in the slightest, because the car breaking down does not stop me from living virtuously and having a good moral character. What can I change in this situation? Only how I view it, and how I respond.\n\nIf a storm comes and takes the fire out, can you control it? Yes you might say, I can put something over the fire. What happens if the cover is blown away? You can try your best to keep it going, but in the end the fire is doing its own thing. If you would say \"Stop burning\", will it change what its doing? If it takes over a tree and burns it down, you can try to control it, but the outcome will be directed by fate and the fire itself, not you.\n\nStoicism does NOT lead to passivity. If I am a stoic and my house burns down, I don't just sit there, because me valuing the house is all in my head. I try to put the fire out, call the fire-brigade, get my family out etc. But if I still lose it all, I can't change that. I can only change how I respond to it. I did what I could, and now I do what I can with my response to the situation. There is no passivity in this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"I can also exert some level of control over other people. Say my wife is feeling tired and irritable. I can either, as a good Stoic, try to feel good about that, or I can get up from the lounge and bring her a glass of wine and some crackers with Taramasalata.\"\n\nAnd why would a stoic behave differently? Its not inside my control if my wife comes home tired and irritated. It is in my control to get up and help her get out of this situation. I can try my best efforts, but if she still remains grumpy, or acts irrational, that's not up to me. Its up to me how I react to it when she does so. If she insults me for not bringing her the right things I can only change what I make of this and how I react. Oh what funny noises her mouth makes, airwaves hitting my ear, my brain translating it to words. But have I actually been insulted or harmed by this? Only if I choose so. Don't get me wrong, I will not take such insults forever, I don't have to only because I am a stoic (Again, stoicism is NOT passivity, you are allowed to react to it and change things). I can control how I respond, and talk back, discuss it with her. And if nothing works I can go elsewhere. Stoicism is NOT passivity. Its seeing what actually is happening and not what my mind tries to make of it. Was I really insulted, our does my mind think I was insulted. What happens if choose not to feel harmed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"If we focus only on our character, reactions, and actions, as Stoicism proposes, and put no effort into things that lie beyond our direct control, it seems to me that a practicing Stoic will remain passive in the face of major problems like climate change or social inequality.\"\n\nNot at all. First of all as I already said, we can try our best to better the world and help to tackle climate change etc. We don't just have to accept it. Secondly an important aspect of stoicism is helping others and doing good. Stoics argue that its in our nature to help mankind as best as we can. Marcus Aurelius says in Meditations 6.54 \"What brings no benefit to the hive brings none to the bee\". So as stoics it is our duty to stand up when social inequality happens, when others are violated, when nature is destroyed. As William Irvine writes \"To fulfill my social duty\u2014to do my duty to my kind\u2014I must feel a concern for all mankind.  I must remember that we humans were created for one another, that we were born, says Marcus, to work together the way our hands or eyelids do.  Therefore, in all I do, I must have as my goal \u2018the service and harmony of all.\u2019  More precisely, \u2018I am bound to do good to my fellow-creatures and bear with them\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"\\[Talking about Nietzsche\\] It might be that you succeed, to some degree at least, and this brings with it the satisfaction of self-expression. Or you might fail, and feel frustrated, or angry, or depressed. For him, all of this is fine. It is natural to experience both success and failure, feeling good and feeling bad.\"\n\nIf the outcomes of us trying to take control about something makes us feel angry, depressed etc. we should look inward and try to find where this is coming from. This would be a topic of assent. We would have to look at our judgement of good and bad, related to this topics. Why do I feel angry that my attempt at reaching this goal failed? Was I actually harmed when it happened, or is this something that I judge as bad, even though nothing actually makes it bad. I failed to climb this mountain, it was to steep for me. This depresses me. Why so? The mountain hasn't decided that you should fail, nothing was working against you, nothing has harmed you. Train harder, and try again if its your goal to climb it. But look inwards to find out why it bothers you that something did not go your way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"No one would ever achieve anything incredible, or step beyond their own limitations and boundaries, if they simply accepted that the only thing they could \u201creally\u201d control was themselves.\"\n\nI want to respond to this with quote from Zeno \"Man conquers the world by conquering himself.\". We think the human body can only achieve so much, while most of the limitations are only in the head. Stoicism is a philosophy by which you \"conquer\" the mind. This philosophy can help achieving many things. Lets take David Goggins or Nimsdai Purja as examples. They did not step beyond limitations, they shattered them. They understand that the only thing they can \"really\" control IS themselves. With this in mind they can push beyond the wildest imaginations of others. Where others fail and say this is not possible for a human, they realize its in the mind, and conquered it. Nimsdai climbed the 14 highest mountains in the world in 6 months. Before him the record was 7 years. Something that everyone deemed impossible was achieved only because he could control himself. He understood what was in his control (giving everything and pushing hard), and what was not (weather, storms, avalanches). \"make the best of what is in our power, and take the rest as it occurs.\" - Epictetus. The only thing you can control is yourself, and that leads to greatness. Stoicism is not a philosophy of mediocre people, but its a philosophy which tells you its okay if you don't achieve these things. In the end it will never be in your control if you \"make it\" or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"The Stoics argue the reason we should accept that we can\u2019t control anything out there in the world is because if we don\u2019t end up getting our own way, we might feel bad about it. This is the point about externals versus internals in Stoic theory: you can\u2019t control externals, so don\u2019t pursue them, or you might get frustrated, angry or bitter.\"\n\nIts hard to argue about stoicism if the things that are brought up stem from total misinterpretations, and have nothing to do with what stoicism actually tells us to do. We don't abandon externals because we could get angry if we don't get them. We abandon externals because its impossible to determine the outcome. We can only control how we react to them. \"you can\u2019t control externals, so don\u2019t pursue them, or you might get frustrated, angry or bitter.\" has nothing to do with stoicism. We stop focusing on externals, not because we might get frustrated, angry or bitter. We stop focusing on them because we have no control over them. What we have control over are the emotions of frustration, anger etc. We can control if they ever arise (Discipline of assent) and can find out where they come from (wrong interpretation of impressions) and why. We can control how we react if they come up. How you respond to things is up to you. Anger and resentment are not things that have to happen. They only happen through assenting to them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"Surely feeling strong, negative emotions is (perhaps strangely) one of the great experiences in life? Why do we love horror films, sad songs, tragic theater, in-your-face artwork? Isn\u2019t it to evoke precisely these emotions \u2013 hatred, contempt, disgust, fear, anger? Stoicism, it seems to me, takes away from us something that we love to experience, albeit in a somewhat roundabout way.\"\n\nStoics are not robots. Stoicism does NOT tell you to not have emotions, not having emotions is impossible. Stoicism teaches you to think about why certain emotions are evoked (Why am I angry? Should I be? What actually happened?) and if you should change they way you view events. If you go to a movie you want them to evoke emotions, you can enjoy them, you basically paid for these emotions. I just don't get attached to needing these emotions and movies to live a good life. If you like horror movies, why shouldn't you go and watch one?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"\\[About Nietzsches views\\] Emotions like frustration, contempt or anger can be bad, but they can also be helpful.\"\n\nWhen was anger ever useful? When has anger ever helped achieved anything, that would have been impossible without it ? When does anger allow me to do something that I would not be able to do when I am composed and calm? Anger only comes from having wrong value judgements, and assenting to them. Someone cuts me of in traffic and I get angry. How useful, he is in front of me and happy and I am behind and angry. Or maybe I could realize that nothing terrible has happened, I am still on my way to the shop, maybe I get there 5 sec later. I assent to anger because my judgement of the situation is wrong. Change the judgement, and anger is no more. Anger is never helpful. Its only a response to wrong judgements.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"But I take issue with the argument that if someone feels injured by something I have done or said, the problem is actually in their heads, rather than in my actions. If I flip perspectives \u2013 couldn\u2019t I simply say that I am free to do whatever I please and if people feel injured, well that\u2019s on them? So in what sense am I obligated to behave well towards others?\"\n\nI believe this comes from a lack of understanding stoicism. No, you are not free to do whatever. If you are a stoic, virtue stops you from acting like this. Its not virtues to insult or hit others. And they are open to defend themselves if someone does something like this. Yes, if I get insulted its my own decision how to respond. Was I actually harmed? No. Okay so what now? Well I can stop seeing this person if they are only trying to get me down, if they attack me I can call the police or fight back. This is all in my control, and its my decision on what to make of it. Virtue guides us to not harm others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\"You will die. People you love will abandon you. Stoicism confronts all of these realities and says 'just accept.' But when it comes to your feelings of personal injury it says: 'reject.' Reject the sensation of loss. Ignore the financial consequence. Whatever you think this injury has cost you \u2013 it hasn\u2019t.\"\n\nAnd again, this can only come from a wrong understanding of stoicism. We aren't here to just accept everything. If someone steals from you you can do multiple things. You don't just stand there and let everything happen to you, as if you are not there. \"Burn my house down. I can just change how I react to it\". No, you can try to stop them, you can go to police, you can try things to mitigate this. Its only if this still happens, that you use the stoic principals to cope with it. And finally: Yes, I must die. But must I die bawling? I must be exiled; but is there anything to keep me from going with a smile, calm and self-composed?. - Epictetus\n\n\\------------------- **Conclusion** \\-------------------\n\nI come to the conclusion that this article is based on a lack of understanding in stoicism and uses multiple straw-man arguments. It's easy to dismiss stoicism, when you use a dumbed down form of it. The author lacks fundamental knowledge about multiple important aspects of stoicism such as the disciplines of desire, action and assent. He shows no knowledge about impressions and the social duty that stoics view as important.\n\nActually reading the works of Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius would have hugely benefited the author and maybe changed his opinion on a lot of things.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677868147.0},{"title":"How can I focus on the process without fantasizing success and unreal scenarios?","author":"Dr0ne-Str1ke","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11hz3b2\/how_can_i_focus_on_the_process_without\/","text":"I have noticed this about myself.

I thought I'd share this here...\n\n\"An Open Letter To The Next Generation Of Artists \u2013 by Herbie Hancock and Wayne Shorter\nTo the Next Generation of Artists,\n\nWe find ourselves in turbulent and unpredictable times.\n\nFrom the horror at the Bataclan to the upheaval in Syria and the senseless bloodshed in San Bernardino, we live in a time of great confusion and pain. As an artist, creator and dreamer of this world, we ask you not to be discouraged by what you see but to use your own lives, and by extension your art, as vehicles for the construction of peace.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the issues facing the world are complex, the answer to peace is simple; it begins with you. You don\u2019t have to be living in a third world country or working for an NGO to make a difference. Each of us has a unique mission. We are all pieces in a giant, fluid puzzle, where the smallest of actions by one puzzle piece profoundly affects each of the others. You matter, your actions matter, your art matters.\n\nWe\u2019d like to be clear that while this letter is written with an artistic audience in mind, these thoughts transcend professional boundaries and apply to all people, regardless of profession.\n\nFIRST, AWAKEN TO YOUR HUMANITY\n\nWe are not alone. We do not exist alone and we cannot create alone. What this world needs is a humanistic awakening of the desire to raise one\u2019s life condition to a place where our actions are rooted in altruism and compassion. You cannot hide behind a profession or instrument; you have to be human. Focus your energy on becoming the best human you can be. Focus on developing empathy and compassion. Through the process you\u2019ll tap into a wealth of inspiration rooted in the complexity and curiosity of what it means to simply exist on this planet. Music is but a drop in the ocean of life.\n\nEMBRACE AND CONQUER THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED\n\nThe world needs new pathways. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be hijacked by common rhetoric, or false beliefs and illusions about how life should be lived. It\u2019s up to you to be the pioneers. Whether through the exploration of new sounds, rhythms, and harmonies or unexpected collaborations, processes and experiences, we encourage you to dispel repetition in all of its negative forms and consequences. Strive to create new actions both musically and with the pathway of your life. Never conform.\n\nWELCOME THE UNKNOWN\n\nThe unknown necessitates a moment-to-moment improvisation or creative process that is unparalleled in potential and fulfillment. There is no dress rehearsal for life because life, itself, is the real rehearsal. Every relationship, obstacle, interaction, etc. is a rehearsal for the next adventure in life. Everything is connected. Everything builds. Nothing is ever wasted. This type of thinking requires courage. Be courageous and do not lose your sense of exhilaration and reverence for this wonderful world around you.\n\nUNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF OBSTACLES\n\nWe have this idea of failure, but it\u2019s not real; it\u2019s an illusion. There is no such thing as failure. What you perceive as failure is really a new opportunity, a new hand of cards, or a new canvas to create upon. In life there are unlimited opportunities. The words, \u201csuccess\u201d and \u201cfailure\u201d, themselves, are nothing more than labels. Every moment is an opportunity. You, as a human being, have no limits; therefore infinite possibilities exist in any circumstance.\n\nDON\u2019T BE AFRAID TO INTERACT WITH THOSE WHO ARE DIFFERENT FROM YOU\n\nThe world needs more one-on-one interaction among people of diverse origins with a greater emphasis on art, culture and education. Our differences are what we have in common. We can work to create an open and continuous plane where all types of people can exchange ideas, resources, thoughtfulness and kindness. We need to be connecting with one another, learning about one another, and experiencing life with one another. We can never have peace if we cannot understand the pain in each other\u2019s hearts. The more we interact, the more we will come to realize that our humanity transcends all differences.\n\nSTRIVE TO CREATE AGENDA-FREE DIALOGUE\n\nArt in any form is a medium for dialogue, which is a powerful tool. It is time for the music world to produce sound stories that ignite dialogue about the mystery of us. When we say the mystery of us, we\u2019re talking about reflecting and challenging the fears, which prevent us from discovering our unlimited access to the courage inherent in us all. Yes, you are enough. Yes, you matter. Yes, you should keep going.\n\nBE WARY OF EGO\n\nArrogance can develop within artists, either from artists who believe that their status makes them more important, or those whose association with a creative field entitles them to some sort of superiority. Beware of ego; creativity cannot flow when only the ego is served.\n\nWORK TOWARDS A BUSINESS WITHOUT BORDERS\n\nThe medical field has an organization called Doctors Without Borders. This lofty effort can serve as a model for transcending the limitations and strategies of old business formulas which are designed to perpetuate old systems in the guise of new ones. We\u2019re speaking directly to a system that\u2019s in place, a system that conditions consumers to purchase only the products that are dictated to be deemed marketable, a system where money is only the means to an end. The music business is a fraction of the business of life. Living with creative integrity can bring forth benefits never imagined.\n\nAPPRECIATE THE GENERATION THAT WALKED BEFORE YOU\n\nYour elders can help you. They are a source of wealth in the form of wisdom. They have weathered storms and endured the same heartbreaks; let their struggles be the light that shines the way in the darkness. Don\u2019t waste time repeating their mistakes. Instead, take what they\u2019ve done and catapult you towards building a progressively better world for the progeny to come.\n\nLASTLY, WE HOPE THAT YOU LIVE IN A STATE OF CONSTANT WONDER\n\nAs we accumulate years, parts of our imagination tend to dull. Whether from sadness, prolonged struggle, or social conditioning, somewhere along the way people forget how to tap into the inherent magic that exists within our minds. Don\u2019t let that part of your imagination fade away. Look up at the stars and imagine what it would be like to be an astronaut or a pilot. Imagine exploring the pyramids or Machu Picchu. Imagine flying like a bird or crashing through a wall like Superman. Imagine running with dinosaurs or swimming like mer-creatures. All that exists is a product of someone\u2019s imagination; treasure and nurture yours and you\u2019ll always find yourself on the precipice of discovery.\n\nHow does any of this lend to the creation of a peaceful society you ask? It begins with a cause. Your causes create the effects that shape your future and the future of all those around you. Be the leaders in the movie of your life. You are the director, producer, and actor. Be bold and tirelessly compassionate as you dance through the voyage that is this lifetime.\n\n\u2013 Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock (2016)\"","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1677850825.0},{"title":"What are some tips for beginners in stoicism","author":"Mrstoicthestoicman","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11hnmyb\/what_are_some_tips_for_beginners_in_stoicism\/","text":"I\u2019m pretty new to this but so far I\u2019ve really enjoyed it so if there\u2019s any books or stuff I should check out I would love to know","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1677899020.0},{"title":"How can one apply Stoicism in taking an examination -- before, during, and after?","author":"AmbitiousMeringue702","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11h52c2\/how_can_one_apply_stoicism_in_taking_an\/","text":"I am about to take a career-defining examination and I thought of applying the principles of Stoicism.

Spotify for Android TV is shit for finding artists in your library alphabetically so I went to the search tab and pressed search.\n\nUsually, a keyboard comes up with the little microphone and you can just speak the name of the band into your remote. But this time it said \"use the remote on your Android device\" Fuck what happened? Somehow, my Google account  had been signed out.\n\nSo then I went to my Google account sign in. It says:\n\nHi David, enter your email:\n\nI enter my email\n\nHi David, enter your password:\n\nMy password is an extremely long combination of letters numbers and special figures, as it should be. Most of my passwords are actually secure like this. Unfortunately, this makes it nearly impossible to enter a secure password unless I can copy\/paste (I am neurologically disabled, typing is impossible).\n\nFor this, I use a password manager. Password managers are useless on a TV, unless you can copy\/paste that password onto an app that controls the keyboard function of your TV somehow. \n\nSo, I download \"Android TV remote app\" to try this copy\/paste function. Only, there is no copy\/paste function. This \"remote\" doesn't even have a keyboard. There is a \"pay $4.99 for pro\", but it fails to mention whether you can copy\/paste or if there even is a keyboard. Great.\n\nAt this point, I'm trying to decide if this is all worth it. I could just use the Spotify app on my phone and cast it to the TV screen. But I enjoy reading the lyrics on the big screen and when you cast it does not do that. It's been about 10 minutes by now, maybe more. \n\nI could waste more time like I have in the past trying to find the solution for my problem - and I guarantee I will find the solution, I always do. But I'm fucking dying, we all are - why waste time on this trivial stuff?\n\nI try one more thing - I download the Nvidia Shield app. I know this app has a keyboard, but copy\/paste functionality has always been VERY iffy, hence why I deleted it from my phone. I go back to the Google prompt for my password. I press the little keyboard icon on the app. \n\nLo and behold the copy\/paste box appears!! \n\nBut I do nothing. This is what technology has wrought. This same instance has happened many times before and will surely happen again. I decide to document this whole mess instead. This shit just isn't for me.\n\nIt has now been 1 hour.

This helps them develop a sense of inner peace and resilience, even in difficult circumstances.\n* We discuss the importance of living in accordance with our values and principles, rather than being swayed by external pressures or distractions. This helps my children develop a strong sense of identity and purpose.\n* I encourage them to set goals and break them down into manageable steps, focusing on each part of the process in order to achieve the end result. I also emphasize the importance of taking breaks and engaging in self-care to recharge and come back stronger.\n* We talk often about how to handle mistakes and setbacks, and I explain to my children that failure is a natural part of life and an opportunity to learn and grow. We also discuss how to forgive oneself and take responsibility for one's actions and decisions.\n* As a family, we set goals and discuss how to achieve them, encouraging and supporting each other along the way. We also emphasize the importance of not only achieving personal success, but also of helping others and making a positive impact on the community.\n\nIn conclusion, parenting with the principles of stoic philosophy in mind can help instill important values and skills in children that can help them navigate life's challenges and become happy and fulfilled adults.

I am basing this discussion primarily on quotes from the work of Chris Fisher and this document: \n\n[https:\/\/traditionalstoicism.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Providence-or-Atoms-a-very-brief-defense-of-the-Stoic-worldview.pdf](https:\/\/traditionalstoicism.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Providence-or-Atoms-a-very-brief-defense-of-the-Stoic-worldview.pdf)\n\nOfc. an answer from u\/Chris_Fisher-SOF would be great, because I am primarily raising questions about his work. Here we go:\n\n\\------------------------------ **Where I am coming from** \\---------------------------\n\nI am studying stoicism for about 4 years now. I read the works of Marcus, Senca and Epictetus, listend to many podcasts (including stoicism on fire) and read multiple blogs etc. So I would say I have a decent baseline, but I am not too advanced. I am now trying to find out more about the theological aspect of stoicism. I come from an agnostic worldview but not detached from a bit of spirituality (daoism, flow of life etc.). \n\nI came to understand that the traditional side of stoicism is strongly built on a god\/providential cosmos, A reason behind all of it, someone who did the first cause (cause and effect). But I find it hart to grasp **WHY** it is needed for stoicism to work. In my opinion stoicism works just fine without a god that oversees it all, without a grand plan. Let me dive deeper into why I dont think its needed, but I would love to know if I have an error in my thinking and that a theological aspect is needed for it to all make sense and work.\n\n\\------------------------------ **Quotes and Arguments** \\---------------------------\n\n1. \u201eHuman psyches need to be tethered to something lest they risk drifting aimlessly into the dark abyss of meaninglessness.\u201c \n\n(Quote from the document linked above). Why would a cosmos that is purely relying on cause and effect, or even randomness (true randomness of quantum objects) lead to meaninglessness? Life is what we make of it, and for us stoics it is about being virtues. And that stems from pure logic, as virtue is the only thing in our control. No need for a god to make this work. We give our life meaning, and it has the same meaning no matter if believe in a providential cosmos or not. I would love to get an answer on to why a universe without a god would lead to a meaningless life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. \u201eFinally, we must grasp our expanded role as citizens of the cosmos. We are individuals; however, we are also interdependent social beings. Each of us is a part of the whole and virtue cannot be developed in isolation.\u201c \n\n100% agree, but still there is no need for a god\/providence to make this argument work. In the end everyone of us is the whole universe. We are the universe (why should WE (ourselves) end at the last pore of our skin? Why isnt the air molecule next to it? Why isnt the wood molecule we are sitting on us, why isnt every atom in the end us, and thus making us the universe?). And if we realize that we are all connected it would lead us to the fact that we are one with everyone and we should help everyone. Be social, help each other, try to make the best of humanity, because in the end we are it. So if we come from this point of view, a god\/providence is not needed to make that part of stoicism (That which is not good for the bee-hive cannot be good for the bees.) work. Even when you purely accept logic and physics, this argument will stay true. No need for a god to make it work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. \u201eWhile the concept of providence is not difficult to grasp, many moderns attempting to practice Stoicism will find it difficult to assent to. Regrettably, many object to providence without giving it full consideration. This may be due to its religious implications, or because they simply do not realize how essential providence is to Stoic ethical theory and practice.\u201c. \n\n* The Discipline of assent is teaching us to make correct judgements about the external things that happen to us. Well lets try to make a correct judgement about the cosmos. Is there a single proof for a rational universe\/a god? No. So shouldnt we go with the more logical assent of \u201ethere is no god and it all works on simple physic rules\u201c? In my opinion assenting to a feeling\/thinking cosmos would be a wrong, or illogical. And thats not stoic. Or am I missing something? \n* \u201ehow essential providence is to Stoic\u2026 \u201c Is it? I am here to learn why it is. I would love to understand the argument behind it, its a bit hard to grasp tho. Why would stoicism and the ethics behind it stop working when we would stop believing in the providence? I think it all works perfectly without it. But maybe I dont get something? Sure if everything is atoms and cause and effect is there truly a free will? Probably not, but it appears to be, so we should still go with it, as this is the impression that is provided to us. We still can be a stoic even when everything is predetermined. And arent we already believing in this predetermined world. In stoicism its called fate. Armor Fati etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. \u201eTrust in providence allows us to take a step back from our circumstances and view the whole of our life from a distance.\u201c \n\nStill possible without providence. I can take a step back and try to view all the causes and effects happening, leading to all that surrounds us. Realizing the unimportance of small problems, realizing the grand scheme and how small we are in it. (Matter: how tiny your share of it. Time: how brief and fleeting your allotment of it. Fate: how small a role you play in it. - Marcus Aurelius). All this works even when you only believe in atoms. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. \u201e\\[About Providence\\] We refuse to swallow until the bitterness becomes so unpleasant we cannot do otherwise. As a result, we often become discontented and angry about the circumstances of our lives.\u201c \n\nWell no. Why should I be discontented and angry? All the workings of the universe lead up to it. This is what I was given (not my providence but my randomness) and its my hand. And I will make the best of it, I dont get grumpy only because randomness dealt me a bad hand. Its still fine and I still can use stoicism to make the best of it. Why would this stop working without a god?\n\n\\------------------------------ **Conclusio** \\---------------------------\n\nFor everybody still reading: Wow. You almost made it. Some last thoughts: Maybe I am missing something, but I find no logical reason for a need of a god\/providence, or whatever you wanna call it, to make stoicism work. It all works just fine without it. The universe came into existence by pure luck, maybe it was always there, we shouldn't care. We are here, thats a fact (cogito, ergo sum), so we should make the best of it. And stoicism can help us make the best of it. It leads us to a path of helping others, doing good deeds, bettering oneself and living a happy life. And personally I found no reason why this shouldn't work without a god. Please tell me if I am missing something. **Its\u2019 the truth I am after.** \n\n***Cheers***","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677785881.0},{"title":"How do stoics help others and contribute to society?","author":"Expensive_Elk_3306","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11gb5jk\/how_do_stoics_help_others_and_contribute_to\/","text":"Hi\nI\u2019m 16 and fairly new to stoicism.

Why would I manifest something so terrible for my child?\" I would ask myself over and over and over.

In 1965 P\u0101rs\u0101 was appointed Deputy Minister of Education and on 27 August 1968 she became Minister of Education in the cabinet of the Amir-Abbas Hoveyda. It was the first time in the history of Iran that a woman occupied a cabinet position. \n\n>Following the Iranian Revolution, Parsa was arrested and tried by the Islamic Revolutionary Court for allegedly \"plundering the national treasury,\" \"causing corruption and spreading prostitution\" in the Ministry of Education, \"collaborating with SAVAK\" and \"dismissing combatant educators from the Ministry of Education,\" and \"being involved in passing anti-people laws\". Although Parsa was allowed to make statements in her own defense in the second session of her trial, there was no indication that she was allowed to question those who testified against her, and there is no mention of defense witnesses. Parsa was executed by firing squad on 8 May 1980 in Tehran,\n\nThe next part of the article is a quote from a letter she wrote to her family before being executed, and it strikes me as a perfect example of conduct worthy of a Stoic philosopher:\n\n>In her last letter from prison, Farrokhroo Parsa wrote to her children: \"I am a doctor, so I have no fear of death. Death is only a moment and no more. I am prepared to receive death with open arms rather than live in shame by being forced to be veiled. I am not going to bow to those who expect me to express regret for fifty years of my efforts for equality between men and women. I am not prepared to wear the chador and step back in history.\"\n\nCompare this to the quotes from [Discourses of Epictetus Book I chapters 1 and 2](https:\/\/standardebooks.org\/ebooks\/epictetus\/discourses\/george-long\/text\/book-1). In the second chapter Epictetus talks about how we should always keep in mind what is appropriate for us, and to live according to that, even if it costs us our lives:\n\n>Priscus Helvidius also saw this, and acted conformably. For when Vespasian sent and commanded him not to go into the senate, he replied, \u201cIt is in your power not to allow me to be a member of the senate, but so long as I am, I must go in.\u201d \u201cWell, go in then,\u201d says the emperor, \u201cbut say nothing.\u201d \u201cDo not ask my opinion, and I will be silent.\u201d \u201cBut I must ask your opinion.\u201d \u201cAnd I must say what I think right.\u201d \u201cBut if you do, I shall put you to death.\u201d \u201cWhen then did I tell you that I am immortal? You will do your part, and I will do mine: it is your part to kill; it is mine to die, but not in fear: yours to banish me; mine to depart without sorrow.\u201d\n\nChapter 1 reinforces the idea:\n\n>Tell me the secret which you possess. I will not, for this is in my power. But I will put you in chains. Man, what are you talking about? Me in chains? You may fetter my leg, but my will not even Zeus himself can overpower. I will throw you into prison. My poor body, you mean. I will cut your head off. When then have I told you that my head alone cannot be cut off? These are the things which philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily, in which they should exercise themselves.\n\nA similar idea is expressed in John Sellars' \"Stoicism\". He claims it can be seen in terms of self-preservation. If we bow to a tyrant and do his bidding we preserve ourselves as living animals, but we don't preserve ourselves as free, rational beings who choose in accord with Justice. And then we must come back to the idea expressed in the second chapter of the Discourses - which do we consider more appropriate for us? What do we want to preserve?\n\nOf course it's easy to sit in a chair at home writing a reddit post about how it would be appropriate to do such and such. And this is what makes Dr Parsa so impressive to me - she actually faced this choice, and she made the one that I believe a Stoic should aspire to.\n\nCredit to [the original post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/todayilearned\/comments\/11fi471\/til_of_dr_farrokhroo_parsa_physician_womens\/) where I learned about her.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1677748603.0},{"title":"How to handle toxic people","author":"EntertainmentKey5301","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11g51pz\/how_to_handle_toxic_people\/","text":"As a person practicing stoicism, how would you guys handle and treat people in your surroundings, that you cannot fully ignore (like family members at gatherings or family of my boyfriend), that are toxic. \n\nHow do you handle.... criticism, snarky backhanded remarks, fat-shaming, old-school-opinions, sexism, rascism?

I\u2019ve always wanted to be in a relationship and have kids but everyday I feel like it becomes less likely, my S\/O would have to accept to have a person with special needs in their lives and I don\u2019t blame them if it\u2019s a deal breaker. \n\nDuring December 2022 I came across a stoicism video on YouTube from the daily stoic guy. Read more into it and went and bought meditations by Marcus Aurelius and discourses by Epictetus. It didn\u2019t help me turn my life around BUT it did help me control my emotions and the way I receive things that happen to me and differentiate if it\u2019s in my control or not. I\u2019m still learning and still catch myself everyday having negative emotions but it\u2019s different now, I don\u2019t spiral down a hole of self loathing and depression, I analyze it and sit down to read. I\u2019ve gone to the gym now for 3 months and lost about 50 pounds bringing me back to my old healthy weight. \nI let go of my pride and have been looking for a job, to get back on my feet pay off my debt and hopefully try again with another business which I already have in mind. I\u2019ve also really slowed the use of my phone by over 70%. \n\nI don\u2019t feel happy, but I feel at peace, I came to a conclusion that unless I\u2019m dead then I can still keep pushing. I\u2019m still learning about stoicism but I can say that it saved the way I perceived my world and the pain I was going through.\n\nI rambled a lot here but I hope it helps someone. I didn\u2019t include any quotes because I thought it\u2019d make to post too long but I will say, telling myself \u201cMemento Mori\u201d multiple times throughout my day makes things just a little bit better.

Milne (Winnie-the-Pooh)\n\n\nOne of the most common posts are people seeking to get over or forget about bad breakups or people they once loved. This is the incorrect path. To be able to love and care about someone without attachment isn't a negative trait. To love with attachment, desire, and selfishness is a passion. \n\nWe can't replace one passion with another passion. \n\nWhen someone feels the sense of loss, it can feel like an injury. That can then turn to anger. To stop that anger is the goal. IE love your fate and love the experience. \n\n\"Accept the things to which fate binds you, and love the people with whom fate brings you together, but do so with all your heart.\"\n\nMarcus Aurelius Meditations \n\n \nII. 1. 3] There can be no doubt that anger is aroused by the direct impression of an injury; but the question is whether it follows immediately upon the impression and springs up without assistance from the mind, or whether it is aroused only with the assent of the mind. Our opinion is that it ventures nothing by itself, but acts only with the approval of the mind. For to form the impression of having received an injury and to long to avenge it, and then to couple together the two propositions that one ought not to have been wronged and that one ought to be avenged -- this is not a mere impulse of the mind acting without our volition. The one is a single mental process, the other a complex one composed of several elements; the mind has grasped something, has become indignant, has condemned the act, and now tries to avenge it. These processes are impossible unless the mind has given assent to the impressions that moved it.\n\nSeneca on anger","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677521522.0},{"title":"how does one deal with low self esteem and low self confidence in stoicism?","author":"SkySCC","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11edzg1\/how_does_one_deal_with_low_self_esteem_and_low\/","text":"I am *very new to stoicism.* But I found it highly relatable.

I\u2019ve read Enchiridion a few times and listened to the audio book. (This has been my favorite so far.) I\u2019m working my way through Discourses for a second time. (Very dense, I have to take my time but this could be the translation I have too.) About half way through Meditations and about to finish How To Think like Roman Emperor. I have read I few of Senecas letters and listen to them on audiobook frequently. (Senecas style of writing is probably my favorite. He seems to be a combo of Epictetus and Aurelius, combo of teacher and friend.) I have found interest in Buddhism but got a little derailed with that when introduced to some of the spiritual aspects. The spiritual stuff has always been a hurdle for me. I just don\u2019t see the world that way. That\u2019s been one of the appeals of Stoicism to me. \n\nIt never dawned on me that I had this much power over myself. I have seen major improvements since discovering Stoicism in regards to my anger issues, depression, relationship with my wife and kids and work and friends, and just in my normal day to day. I am literally getting out of the bed each day throwing covers off of me telling myself it\u2019s time to start the day, excited to get on with it.

It\u2019s allowed me to focus on what my dad and I did with our time as opposed to getting lost in grief. \n\nThe last week however I have this thought creeping in. Recovery has allowed me the opportunity to be aware so I recognize this as a problem but I\u2019m not seeing a solution. The feeling is that at the end of the day things are just what they are.

The book contains loads of interesting reflections that are relevant to stoicism. It is centrally about man trying to understand the mysteries of the world, the search for truth, and about obsession\/letting go of harmful behaviour.\n\nThe book is written from the viewpoint of a man named Ishmael. Ishmael is interested in understanding the whale from a scientific viewpoint and understanding how the practice of whaling fits in to the world and how it relates to human nature. It teaches an important lesson in what happens when we let ourself be driven by revenge and anger, and how destructive it is for ourselves and those around us.\n\nThis is contrasted with Ahab, the bitter and proud captain. He involves the entire crew in his desperate revenge on the titular Moby Dick, a great white sperm whale who took his leg the last time they met. Ahab sees Moby Dick and other sperm whales as the embodiment of all evil, and he sees himself as locked in a duel to the death with the great white whale. Of course, as the first mate Starbuck pleads for him to understand, the whale is just a whale:\n\n>'Vengeance on a dumb brute!', cried Starbuck, 'that simply smote thee from blind instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing, Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.'  \n>  \n>\\[...\\]  \n>  \n>'That inscrutable thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of blasphemy, man; I\u2019d strike the sun if it insulted me.'\n\nSpoilers for the ending:\n\n>!Ahab is repeatedly warned that he is heading for his death and he seems aware himself that his quest is suicidal. Towards the end of the book, when they close in on Moby Dick, Ahab is repeatedly warned of the danger and death he is heading towards. He realises that his quest has led him to be a bad captain to his crew, an absent husband to his wife and a poor father to his son eagerly awaiting his return. But he is too far gone. He just wishes for Starbuck and the rest to be able to go home and be happy.!<\n\n>!They find Moby Dick and engage the hunt. Two days they lower into their boats and fails to kill it. On the third and final day Starbuck yells to captain Ahab:!<\n\n>>! \"Oh! Ahab,\" cried Starbuck, \"not too late is it, even now, the third day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!\" !<\n\n>!Ahab is too far gone. Moby Dick once again destroys the whaling boats, but percieving the bigger threat, Moby Dick rams the side of the ship itself, causing it to sink, drowning the entire crew. Ahab throws himself at the whale one last time, and is drowned himself. The only ones who survive is the narrator Ishmael by clinging to a lifebuoy, and Moby Dick himself.!<\n\nDon't let yourself be driven by anger and vengeance. In the words of Seneca:\n\n>I don't agree with those who plunge headlong into the middle of the flood and who, accepting a turbulent life, struggle daily in great spirit with difficult circumstances. The wise person will endure that, but won't choose it - choosing to be at peace, rather than at war\n\nSeneca, Moral Letters, 28.7","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1677490402.0},{"title":"How do I focus on myself more","author":"Infusen51","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11djyrn\/how_do_i_focus_on_myself_more\/","text":"I've only been focusing on dating apps, and temporary gratification lately.

I\u2019ve had ups and downs, but most of the time I feel pretty down and somewhat lost. Not going into details because it\u2019s not really relevant but never had I felt like that before. \n\nI\u2019ve come to realise that 90% of my problems come from relationships and my thought process around them. I feel a strong desire to have someone who I can care about and that cares about me back, but things in the last while haven\u2019t worked out that way. Long story short I\u2019ve put a lot more effort into someone else than they have with me, and I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s time to stop pursuing that because it\u2019s only causing me more harm than good. \n\nI can confidently say I have no issues with any other aspect of my life. In all other realms (for lack of better words), nothing really phases me and I find it very easy to apply what I\u2019ve learned as a Stoic. I rarely worry and don\u2019t ever feel anxious about anything. \n\nHowever when it comes to romantic relationships, it\u2019s the exact opposite. I\u2019ve realised I have a very anxious attachment style to people. I\u2019m always worried about them and at times it gets to the point where I feel physically uneasy because of it. \n\nThis isn\u2019t really helped by the fact that this other person doesn\u2019t want the same things I was looking for, however they made that clear from the start so I can\u2019t place any fault on them, but I was hopeful it would change. So the fault is mine for placing value in something I cannot control. \n\nI\u2019m not worried about never being in a relationship again, I know there is plenty of people out there and I don\u2019t have any issues meeting new people, but what I do end up doing is fixating on one person so I find it difficult to look past them. I\u2019ve come to realise my relationship with this specific person is logically not something I want anymore, despite my feelings still telling me otherwise, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction. \n\nRight now I want to go back to focusing on myself. I need to get back my independence and want to stop constantly looking for someone else to fill that hole. I would like to reach the point where I am fully content to be by myself and not constantly searching for someone else.\n\nAs for my practices, I must say they\u2019ve been lacking. I have been reading Discourses, but not nearly as much as I should be and I\u2019ve not read much at all recently. I browse most of the posts here and like reading responses from more experienced Stoics and even give some advice myself when I feel I can, and I\u2019ve definitely learned a lot from that. I feel I\u2019m at a point where I have a relatively good understanding, however I am not putting it into practice as much as I should be. \n\nI\u2019ll be getting back to reading a few chapters every night, but I\u2019m wondering what other words of advice, wisdom or experience others may have to help.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1677528797.0},{"title":"how to be alone when depressed and stop calling people (my family when i am upset and highly depressed)?","author":"Ok_Huckleberry7725","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11dhkdy\/how_to_be_alone_when_depressed_and_stop_calling\/","text":"I know i am alone in this world and i have made my life what it is right now and i don't have friends.

This is my first time posting here. I'm a student and there's something that's really been bugging me for the past few years since my high school times.   \nWhen I was in high school, I lost a very great friend of mine who I've known for a couple years. She was like a mentor to me, she would teach me a lot about science, history, philosophy, and basically life in general. To this day I never really got over her death. I felt I lost not only a great leading figure in life who cared for me, but also as if a part of myself died with her.   \nSince then I really developed a cynical worldview, and felt that everything good around me would turn bad, leaving me in a terrible world. My parents used to be nice, but recently they argue more than they ever did. My buddies from high school no longer have the energy and enthusiasm they had with science and academics like before. The old parks I used to go as a child, the old yugioh card shops I went often, they all disappeared, replaced by some tacky, unattractive buildings.   \nRecently it's gotten worse. I care for my family and my pet dog as they care for me, but I started contemplating: \"What happens after they die? What will happen to me? Do I have no other choice but to carry on with the sense of loss hanging over myself, like with my old mentor?\"   \nThen I stumbled upon a copy of Epictetus' book I received so many years ago from my mentor, and thought what I needed was a way to apply Stoicism to come to terms with my current mentality. My knowledge of Stoicism is quite superficial (I aim to learn more by reading the book) , and I want to ask you guys: How do you deal with this sense of \"inevitability\", how do develop a mindset where I can conquer my fear of loss? People die, things change, but I just don't want to destroy myself ridden with grief.   \n\n\nThanks a lot!","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1677517263.0},{"title":"Stoic guidance : bringing work home","author":"Businessjett","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11d9u82\/stoic_guidance_bringing_work_home\/","text":"Me ( m53 ), wife (f53 ) married 30 years - \n\nI need to love brining work home\n\nMy wife & I work get her, from home, in stressful jobs.\n\nI need to be better at letting my wife talk to me about work whenever she wants. 7pm while watching TV together sure.

On the contrary, they taught that nature pointed out to us certain objects of choice and of rejection, and amongst these some to be *more* chosen and avoided than others; and that virtue consisted in choosing and rejecting objects according to their intrinsic value. They admitted that health was to be preferred to sickness, riches to poverty; the prosperity of our family, of our friends, of our country, to their adversity; and they allowed, nay, they recommended, the most strenuous exertions to accomplish these desirable ends. They only contended these objects should be pursued not as the constituents of our happiness, but because we believe it to be agreeable to nature that we should pursue them; and that, therefore, when we have done our utmost, we should regard the event as indifferent.  -- Dugald Stewart, The Philosophy of the Active and Moral Powers of Man (1829)","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1677322637.0},{"title":"Advice on dealing with the loss of a beloved pet","author":"mychemicalcringe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/11b5a4h\/advice_on_dealing_with_the_loss_of_a_beloved_pet\/","text":"My best friend and beloved cat Mochi suddenly passed away today and I am at a loss as to how to deal with it.

Some people are better than others with the weaker being vicious, full of vice, and seeing power as the ability to satisfy their desires.

It is how we cultivate ourselves and behave towards others that determines the stronger from the weaker.\n\nNow I don\u2019t disagree with most of this but what gets me is whether it is very stoic to use virtue and vice as a way to categorize people as better or worse. It was my understanding that when someone engaged in vice they weren\u2019t a bad person they were just confused as to what was good and evil. A wise person would never think themself superior to the wrong person, rather, they might simply think them self more virtuous and the other individual confused.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m asking here is whether virtue is the determinant of a superior human as compared to an inferior one.

This results in either a sour demeanor towards others or compensating with illusions of being better than everyone else or thinking others are the problem. There are likely more ways this manifests. But it boils down to a fear of being ridiculed for who you are. And these are the ways we cope with this irrationality, by closing ourselves off to others.

I first got into stoicism because my life sucks right now. I was born with mild cerebral palsy, affecting my body's right side, making it significantly weaker. With therapy, I've been able to better my right side where if you took a look at me you wouldn't believe I was born with this condition, but my right arm is like an inch shorter and smaller, where anywhere I go this got me weird looks and jokes like hand jerking motion. Again I get how it looks and how it's funny, and I've never told anyone what I have because why would I, I don't have to be telling my story everywhere I go.\n\nI got into stoicism because I needed to learn how to control my emotions and not worry about what others thought of me. I started working as a cook at this restaurant I left about a year ago, again because I couldn't take the constant jokes about my arm and problems with coworkers. I had to go back because times are tough and this is a high-paying job since I already know what I'm doing. I started learning about Marcus Aurelius' quotes like ***\"You have power over your mind-not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength\".*** The first three days were fine I did hear rude comments and jokes but I didn't let them affect me, but today It felt like everyone was looking at my arm making jokes and when I would get close they would shut up. Today I did feel like it got to me. I felt like everyone was making fun of me with the same joke,  and now I find myself venting on Reddit. \n\nMy arm is a part of me I accept that it helped me become who I am and is still morphing me into the person I am supposed to be. At the moment I can't leave this job because the bills don't wait, and ill probably have to stick around for a  month or two. My family says they don't see it, but I do see it and feel it.

They'd feel seen and understood (they told me so). At the same time, I used to be a relatively unhappy person, maybe that's why it was easy for me to relate and understand, because I had my own fair share of problems...\n\nAnyway, about a year ago I started reading the stoic texts, and as probably many of you experienced as well, my life got a lot better and \"easier\". But I feel like it diminished my ability to empathise a bit, and that's not how it's supposed to be.\n\nIf you applied stoic teachings a thousand times, it's suddenly hard for me to feel empathy with someone throwing a tantrum because the milk is empty. I know the texts say you should be kind and understanding with everyone, and I think that's right, it's what I want to be (again), but often when I listen to people's problems, there's a little voice in the back of my head saying \"how useless, this person could just pull themselves together, think within reason and be done with it!\"\n\nI know of course that it's not that easy, but I just have a hard time with being understanding and kind in these scenarios. Usually I end up just saying nothing and nodding (if you got nothing nice to say, say nothing), but of course some people notice.\n\nE.g. recently a friend whom I haven't seen for a while visited me. They were having a bad time recently and told me about their problems, I reacted how I described above. The next day they told me, the moment they said it out loud they regretted sharing with me, because they felt that I didn't understand them and was a bit annoyed by it (which was true).\n\nI want to be a good friend, and make people feel safe with sharing their thoughts and emotions when they're with me, but I don't wanna pretend I understand them if I don't. \n\nDo you have any advice\/resources for someone in my situation?

Life is just a self-replicating machine. \n\nI sleep, wake up, work, eat junk, sleep and the cycle goes on. I am part of circles where everyone is trying to get one on someone. \n\nI live in a safe German city, but I work in an what in a Spielothek. It's an automat club, gambling machines with virtual games. \n\nA lot of the people come there because it's a place to use the drug, a guest himself told me, brothels and place like this is where drug is sold and consumed. I once found withe lines and attacked the people doing it, I told them clean that up or I will call the police. They did and I was told if I did call the police the boys would probably wait for me after work to stab me and beat me up. \n\nI work many hours dealing with people like that. I have to bend the rules for the firm and not to cause too much chaos, but if I let it go too much it will also not be good. \n\nI have had this God damn account for almost 4 years now. I write the same stuff, nothing is changing, well some things did change, but there is no part of my life I can look back up on and be proud. \n\nI always have some kind of issue be it physical, mental and so on. There is no patch where I can say I was out of the strom, it's just from one storm to another.  \n\nI am getting older and my window for anything is running out, I don't believe there was any, at least for things I used to be. \n\nStoicism was something I tried to cling on to when I had nothing else, I come from a country where saying you are mentally ill is a taboo. Where religion takes precedence, but only when it suits people or they follow it to extremes. Not all, but a lot of double standards are applied. \n\nI have also watched my father trying to receive love from his mother and father, but both were abusive towards him. Social services were once there to pick him up when he was a kid. And in Yugoslavia they would get involved only when you really beat the kid hard, a proper beat down.\n\nI was also beaten by him, I remember once being hit with an extension cable because I ran from school. I still get angry when I remember being hit like that. Sure I did make a mistake, but that does not give you the right to beat me. \n\nAll though I understand him, it's how he was raised too, much worse in fact, they forced him to work and smuggle as a kid.  \n\nI guess we all have our own reasoning and perspectives. \n\nI know I was the reason my father married my mom, who knows how much love there really is, there is something about the fact that you are unwanted or maybe just unplanned. I don't answer to my parents as much, they are back in my home country while I am in Germany, I send them stuff, but I don't know how long this will last. I just don't have the will to live and hopefully I am gonna move somewhere where I can get euthanasia. \n\nThat way I satisfy the condition that I tried what the system has, namely therapy and if it fails, I have a permanent exit. Which I honestly hope to take. \n\nSuicide was normal in ancient Greece and Rome, in Japan it was seen as an honorable way out and it still is. The East has a different view on suicide than the West, although things are changing here too. Looking at Holland and Belgium I think it will come to Germany as well, but Germany is still conservative in some regards and the immigrant population, which I am a part of is overwhelming against such a thing since most of them are bound by Christianity or Islam. \n\nGiven all of that, why fight on, I mean it's always a bad perspective. In Germany the purchasing power is going down, but never have people worked so much. Burn out is rasing in high rates. I am thinking about going to a clinic just to isolate myself from toxic people and my job, which could be seen as an improvement since before I said I would rather die than give myself to mercy of doctors, but what else there is to do?\n\nI just don't have a why, Platonic Forms, Virtue, achieving Nirvana, Logos or something else...\n\nIf you think this is for attention, I don't think it is, I think it's more of a catharsis.

For example,  emotions cause us to react. These emotions come from evolutionary biology, so they shouldn't be ignored.

In fact, many people seem to be downright anti-Stoic in how they deal with their emotions. Worse yet, they seem offended if your emotional affect does not match theirs when they are sad or angry. They want commiseration. I'm not sure how to deal with this. I think it has caused some friction in some of my relationships, and I'm not sure who is the problem - me or them.\n\nI could \"empathize\", but in some situations I'm unsure if that's really a beneficial thing for that person. If someone is frequently upset over something trival or nonexistent, wouldn't it be better for them in the long run to rationally question why they are experiencing those feelings? If a friend of mine is enraged because some other car got in front of them and went 5 mph slower than they wanted to go, wouldn't it be best for that friend to just realize that this costs them an absolutely insignificant amount of time and is not worth screaming over?\n\nI remember a passage from Epictetus (although not the location in the book) about how acting angry may feel like relief but it's actually not; it's just \"throwing fuel on the fire\". It's training you to be an angry person who can't deal with anything except by blowing your temper. How do you empathize and comfort someone without encouraging an unhealthy mindset?\n\nLikewise when someone is depressed. In my pre-Stoic days, I would engage in \"catastrophizing\"; suffering some minor misfortune but adding to it with increasingly negative thoughts until I'm literally weighing the benefits of killing myself. In those cases, it wasn't the misfortune itself that led me to that point - it was my own feedback loop of confabulated negativity. When I learned to cut that process off right at the start and examine the misfortune for what it really was (usually some trivial BS) I became a much more tranquil person (and I can say I haven't had suicidal thoughts in over 6 years). I want others to be free of this harmful process. I want others to be able to rationally examine the problems in their life, solve or accept them, and get back to what brings them joy. When I see people digging themselves into an emotional hole like I used to, I try to tell them to stop adding to it, look at it for what it really is, cool off for a minute and re-examine things, etc. But the most common reaction is offense. They are angry because I'm \"minimizing their feelings\". I'm trying to help them with the process that helped me, but they usually just end up more angry and think I'm an uncaring person.\n\nSo have any of you run into situations like these?

After WW1, the defeated German representatives signed the instrument of armistice in a railway coach in France. The French preserved it as a symbol of their victory and erected a plaque saying:\n\n>'Here on the **eleventh of November 1918** succumbed the criminal pride of the German empire,' the inscription read, 'vanquished by the free peoples which it tried to enslave. ' . The monument depicted a German Imperial Eagle impaled on the point of a sword.\n\nWhen the Germans defeated the French in WW2, they made them sign the armistice, in favour of Germany,  *in* *this exact same Railway coach, on the same memorial site*. Then they took it to Berlin as a trophy.\n\nI have admittedly felt this was an absolutely badass thing to do, and if I ever had to take revenge I would do it in a similar way. I believe in doing it politely and without violence of word or deed, but in a context which should echo the wrong that has been committed against me and highlight how the situation has beenn turned on its head. A sort of last laugh, if you will.\n\nMarcus Aurelius says that the best revenge is not to be like the person. But how would you from a Stoic perspective argue for or against my notion of \"polite revenge\", which is necessarily and deliberately gentler than the initial wrong? Try to explain in detail your position.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677086387.0},{"title":"We suffer more in imagination than in reality, but how I deal with that?","author":"Jezuel24","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/118lzkg\/we_suffer_more_in_imagination_than_in_reality_but\/","text":".","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677031489.0},{"title":"How do I improve my life the stoic way.","author":"Sad_Tooth_4246","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/119i28z\/how_do_i_improve_my_life_the_stoic_way\/","text":"I worry about what other think about me.

Leave them alone.)\n\nNow on to the newsletter:\n\nWe all have reasons we don\u2019t like something. We think a certain comedian isn\u2019t funny or is a hack. We think a certain author is too basic or overhyped. We think that Oscar-winning movie is total garbage. We know what\u2019s stupid and lame, what\u2019s low brow or trash, what\u2019s fake and what\u2019s real, authentic and commercial. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting how certain we are with these opinions about particular people or products. Far less often do we stop and think, \u201cOh maybe I\u2019m just not the audience for that.\u201d\n\nStoicism is often the victim of this by academics. The philosophy is too simple, too self-helpy, too repetitive. Daily Stoic itself is accused of that very thing by fans of Stoicism. I don\u2019t need a coin to remind me of my mortality. Why not just read the original texts instead of some modern book? But again, what if maybe\u2013just maybe\u2013it\u2019s not for you. Maybe it\u2019s for someone else.\n\nSomeone who is struggling.

Someone with different needs than you at this very moment.\n\nThe wiser and smarter we get should not correspond with an increase in snootiness or elitism. On the contrary, we should become more understanding, more accepting. We\u2019ve talked many times about the idea of being strict with yourself and tolerant of others. Nowhere should that idea be applied more than when it comes to taste. Push yourself, have strong or exacting opinions for what you consume, for what you like.\n\nBut why on Earth would you feel the need to have an opinion on what other people like? Why would you want to denigrate what they are getting out of something? Why would you need to step on their joy?\n\nFocus on your own journey. Leave everyone else to their own.

This concept refers to the ability to view oneself as a valuable and deserving being and to act accordingly.\n\nStoic self-respect is based on the assumption that every person is born with reason and moral judgment. It is in our nature to act rationally and virtuously, and these abilities should be used to lead a fulfilling and virtuous life. Self-respect means that we are aware of our responsibility as rational beings to live our lives in accordance with our values and principles.\n\nIn practice, self-respect means that we strive to meet our own standards rather than being determined by the expectations of others. We should make our decisions and actions based on reason and moral judgment, rather than being guided by emotions or external circumstances. Self-respect also requires us to accept and love ourselves, including our flaws and weaknesses. We should focus on our strengths and work to improve ourselves in our lives.\n\nIn everyday life, there are many practical applications of stoic self-respect. For example, we can strive to control our thoughts and emotions to act rationally and sensibly. We can motivate ourselves to achieve our goals and be honest and authentic in order to show our true selves. We can discipline ourselves and control our impulses to act independently and self-determinedly. Furthermore, we can strengthen our self-confidence and self-assurance by acknowledging and utilizing our abilities and strengths to overcome challenges.\n\nOverall, stoic self-respect can contribute to leading a fulfilling and virtuous life. By recognizing ourselves as valuable and deserving beings and using our reason and moral judgment, we can achieve our goals and fulfill our potential. Self-respect is therefore an important aspect of stoic philosophy and can still be relevant to us today.","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1677047178.0},{"title":"What are the examples of things that involve something \"up to us\"?","author":"M00nl19ht","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/118pltv\/what_are_the_examples_of_things_that_involve\/","text":"So I've been reading A.

Let me explain. This will take a while.\n\nI have to deal with boys at class who make fun of my language accent (my native language is not my first language; I'm not fluent in it). I had a private education while they had a public one, so they poke fun at me for that. I'm the Class Prefect, of a sort, so they make fun that who chose ME of all people to be a Prefect.\n\nI've tried staying Stoic. A few days ago, I was sitting quietly in class during break and minding my own business when one of the boys came to me and asked me if I was okay and if he ever said anything that hurt me. Naturally, I thought he wanted to make amends and said it was all good. Not even a minute passed and he started making fun of me in front of the entire class on my English accent. I wanted to pummel him so bad, but I stayed quiet.\n\nThis morning, I got in trouble with the teacher for something the same boy and a few others did that they blamed on me (I won't go into details), and the teacher was convinced I was involved being the Class Prefect. I exposed the boy and said that he was the one who did it, which my teacher didn't believe, and which gave the boys an opportunity to tease and make fun of me even more.\n\nMy parents have said that the only way to deal with this is to show them I'm not bothered, take part in their jokes and fun, and they'll back off. I understand where they're coming from, and this advice would probably work with other boys, but these ones are SPECIAL cases. I'm torn between trying my parents' advice and staying Stoic. The truth is, what else could Stoicism instruct me to do?\n\nI've tried staying quiet, when one of them holds me on the arm or shoulder for too long, I politely tell them to remove it. I've stayed unsmiling, and stayed far away from them as possible. But I still need help, or advice if I'm doing something wrong.

They're all somewhat similar, focussing on the neutrality of the object, virture, moderation, self-awareness ...\n\nDid ChatGPT capture the practical essence of stoicism well?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Coffee**\n\nStoicism is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of rationality, virtue, and self-control in living a good life. While the ancient Stoics did not specifically address coffee, we can use Stoic principles to consider its role in our lives.\n\nFrom a Stoic perspective, coffee itself is neither good nor bad. It is a neutral object that can be used in a virtuous or unvirtuous way. For example, drinking coffee to enhance productivity and focus could be seen as a virtuous use, while using it to stay up late and procrastinate would be seen as an unvirtuous use.\n\nStoicism also emphasizes the importance of self-control and moderation. In the case of coffee, this means that a Stoic would strive to use coffee in moderation, rather than relying on it excessively or becoming addicted to it. A Stoic would also practice self-awareness to determine whether their use of coffee is helping or harming them, and adjust their behavior accordingly.\n\nFinally, Stoicism encourages us to focus on what we can control and to accept what we cannot control. This means that a Stoic would not become overly attached to coffee or upset if they were unable to have it, recognizing that it is not essential to their well-being.\n\nIn summary, Stoicism would suggest that coffee can be a useful tool when used in moderation and for virtuous purposes, but we should be mindful of our use and avoid becoming overly attached to it.\n\n**Sugar**\n\n From a Stoic perspective, sugar itself is neither good nor bad. It is a neutral object that can be used in a virtuous or unvirtuous way.\n\nStoicism emphasizes the importance of self-control and moderation. In the case of sugar, this means that a Stoic would strive to use sugar in moderation, rather than relying on it excessively or becoming addicted to it. A Stoic would also practice self-awareness to determine whether their use of sugar is helping or harming them, and adjust their behavior accordingly.\n\nStoicism also teaches that external things, such as sugar, should not have power over us. Rather, we should focus on our inner character and how we react to external events. Therefore, a Stoic would not allow their desire for sugar to control them or affect their behavior negatively.\n\nAdditionally, Stoicism emphasizes the importance of health and well-being. A Stoic would strive to maintain a healthy diet and avoid excessive consumption of sugar or any other harmful substance. However, if they do consume sugar, they would do so mindfully and with moderation.\n\nIn summary, Stoicism would suggest that sugar can be used in moderation as part of a healthy diet, but we should practice self-control, self-awareness, and focus on our inner character rather than allowing external things to control us.\n\n**Dancing**\n\n Stoicism is a philosophy that emphasizes the importance of rationality, virtue, and self-control in living a good life. While the ancient Stoics did not specifically address dancing, we can use Stoic principles to consider its role in our lives.\n\nFrom a Stoic perspective, dancing itself is neither good nor bad. It is a neutral activity that can be used in a virtuous or unvirtuous way. For example, dancing as a form of exercise or creative expression could be seen as a virtuous use, while using it to indulge in excessive hedonism or vanity would be seen as an unvirtuous use.\n\nStoicism also emphasizes the importance of self-control and moderation. In the case of dancing, this means that a Stoic would strive to engage in dancing in moderation, rather than becoming excessively preoccupied with it or using it to avoid responsibilities. A Stoic would also practice self-awareness to determine whether their engagement in dancing is helping or harming them, and adjust their behavior accordingly.\n\nFinally, Stoicism encourages us to focus on what we can control and to accept what we cannot control. This means that a Stoic would not become overly attached to dancing or upset if they were unable to engage in it, recognizing that it is not essential to their well-being.\n\nIn summary, Stoicism would suggest that dancing can be a virtuous activity when engaged in mindfully and in moderation, but we should be mindful of our use and avoid becoming excessively preoccupied or attached to it.","upvote_ratio":0.3,"created_utc":1677014219.0},{"title":"Impatient, Impulsive, Jealous.","author":"GingerMaestro1984","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/117qjpd\/impatient_impulsive_jealous\/","text":"Just 3 of the things that I recognise in my self that really get to me.

We are guided down one, left alone in another, sabotaged by many, and triumph at the end of the path. We wake in the morning, \"do I get up now, or do I sleep ?\", The first choice to make is upon us as the day starts and it will lead us to known or unknown routes. We sometimes make these decisions without consequence in mind, what will it affect if you choose one or the other, will it be a positive or negative outcome. Ultimately we cannot decide what happens externally but we may take necessary steps toward the intended destination. We must always choose for ourselves with the best intention of self and others in mind as well. Whatever may benefit the good of us collectively is ultimately the goal.\n\nWe must be wise to question all, even if what we are told is with good intentions. Think of all the times we may have been told a certain diet is best for us and it contained harmful products, or that using certain medicines are in our favor but it causes harmful side effects we never wanted, we are all responsible for ourselves. To worry about the right choice isn't the appropriate action either, you need to think clearly, make responsible choices and bear the consequence which follows. Be responsible for the consequence and remain grounded in your choice and defend it or acknowledge the harm and the other options and choose something new. Take the consideration of an option, reflect on it, make a list of pros and cons and take action when necessary.\n\nIn my opinion, we are better off to even take professionals advice into care and give it time and attention to make our own decisions. I would rather think through my choices carefully, make a decision on my behalf and be held responsible if it harms myself or others than to blindly follow the words of someone and take responsibility for what is still my responsibility, though this time without actual thought.\n\nDo not forget, no matter how smart a person may be, or how long they have been in their field of study, that they too are human and can fail any day. If this was not the case, we may have never progressed further in life, and it's thanks to all failures we experience, learn from and grow out of, that we are where we are today.

Like all humans know what they most desire with their life deep down but sometimes they'll unintentionally subconsciously drown out those worrying thoughts to avoid bringing worry and doubt into their lives?\n\nI want to have a much stricter life, knowing that initially i won't be happy inevitably but i'm happy to accept it rather than resent it but i worry being too strict could make someone depressed even if they are achieving a lot every day but being too lenient could make me doubt myself and worry that there's someone out there getting 10x the amount done every day and barely breaking a sweat. \n\nEven with this post i feel i'm seeking comfort or advice that i don't really need, another quote that i don't think is stoicism i remember is \"Change occurs when the fear of staying the same is greater than the fear of change\" which i feel more than ever i just think i'm angry with myself for not pushing myself more and staying on schedule more, I'm more mad at myself knowing that i'm truly envious of those with a more structured life than mine.\n\nIdk, maybe my approach and attitude is what is blocking me, i think maybe i should put all of my focus on improving one area of my life at a time, maybe applying and expecting too much discipline at once is whats troubling me and causing me to struggle? \n\nWhat would any of you do? would you expect and apply discipline to all areas of your life you're not happy with at once? or would you worry about them one problem at a time? Less stressful but will take longer to fix all the problems and bad habits etc, But then again if i'm making close to no progress trying to fix everything at once it makes more sense do go down the route that will guarantee progress.\n\nSorry if this post is confusing, I appreciate any feedback, advice or just others perspective and opinions, It helps me alot hearing how others deal with certain aspects of their life, TIA to anyone who offers their feedback or perspective, it's much appreciated.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1676898416.0},{"title":"Stoics and agression","author":"sunny_taranto","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/1172zp6\/stoics_and_agression\/","text":"Hello everyone, \n\nNew to stoicism here.

I went from a junior to senior position in record speed. My boss suggested around 6 months ago that I should take a role as team lead. My team is very small right now, but the expectation is for it to grow significantly. My boss went sick at the end of the year and the promotion was never solidified.\n\nAt the start of the year as my boss came back a big departmental restructure was announced, and we are now hiring more people into my team. My boss is now pretending my promotion was never agreed and that there are still some issues to iron out because I'm young. Initially we were only hiring juniors in my team but one of the new hires is a senior position, I fear a person with more experience than me will apply and then eventually they will become my boss.\n\nOn one side, the idea of having someone more experienced as my boss is exciting as I already felt that I was incapable of learning a lot from the colleagues in my team and even my boss (he has a lot of business experience, but he switched roles to his new position, so he does not know much about what we do everyday). I really enjoy what I do and the chance of getting smarter at it would be amazing, but I do worry that with another layer of management over me my potential for growth would be stifled. \n\nOn the other hand, I was excited about this new role as team manager.

They seem horribly vague. When I tried to look into further explanations about them, usually they are just described with even more vague terms that are highly open to interpretation. Especially when faced with a difficult decision, I've tried to solve it by thinking about the Stoic virtues (What would be the wise choice here ?). But that never helped me, because often both alternatives would reflect a virtue or could even be justified by the same virtue. I think this \"issue\" becomes most visible, when we try to answer a moral dilemma according to virtues. Like the trolley problem for example. I don't think Stoicism or Virtue Ethics in general has any recommendation in that case. Deontology or Utilitarianism on the other hand has rather clear advice on how to come to a decision. That bothered me. I was hoping to get a clear instruction from Stoicism as well.\n\nBut after reading posts here, and some Seneca, I get more and more the idea that Stoicism and Virtue Ethics describes more an attitude towards life than a solution to one specific problem. In that sense Virtue Ethics, Deontology and Utilitarianism are not necessarily opposites, because they aim at different things. Virtue Ethics is trying to describe how to live your whole life in a good way. Whereas the other two philosophies focus more on the single decision.\n\nFor example living according to the virtue wisdom doesn't mean to always make wise choices, but rather to try to achieve wisdom. That would mean reading a book that increases your knowledge in your free time, instead of going out and drinking. According to my current understanding of Virtue Ethics it then doesn't matter as much how you would attempt to solve a difficult problem as long as you've been trying to achieve wisdom. \n\nIn that sense I would even say that a Stoic could live his life according to the virtues, but when faced with a moral dilemma could take for example utilitarianistic ideas into account, because he knows that Stoicism doesn't really (want to) answer these kind of questions.\n\nWould you agree with my understanding ?","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1676804824.0},{"title":"Easily fall prey to the masses.","author":"ShoffnerN","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Stoicism\/comments\/1160jla\/easily_fall_prey_to_the_masses\/","text":"Though I eventually catch myself from joining the mob and group thought.

Utilizing a dialectic  virtue model, reminisce of Hegelian development, the analysis centers around the ways in which  stoic virtue theory can be applied within anarchist social structure and the consequences of such a  combination. Anarchism provides a particularly flexible framework for implementation; such a  system\u2019s loose structure, with the primary thesis of anti-statism, varies greatly between individuals  and groups. Stoic ethics share in anarchism\u2019s need to reconcile the  individual moral agent with their role in the moral community, and this connection is one in which the individual sovereignty and the  wider community may be brought into a greater degree of flourishing. Stoicism is oft perceived  as mostly conservative, yet not out of necessity, while Anarchism\u2019s progressive libertarian nature  allows for wide interpretation. A Dialectic Virtue Theory can be utilized as a vehicle to connect these  two traditions\u2014Stoicism being it\u2019s exemplar, and Anarchism\u2019s natural freedom of interpretation  and practice. Virtue will then be explored as something which, when pursued in earnest, increases the  flourishing of the individualist as well as the communitarian. Individual Liberty will take  center stage, and as we will see this is echoed in the stoic conceptions of self-discipline; to  discipline one\u2019s own individual attainment of virtue will have ripple effects when given the space to do  so, and since this discipline does not come from a higher authority (ie. the state), this maps  particularly well to anarchist political thought. Hereby the individual is given the utmost freedom to  develop their own ethics of virtue while contributing positively to the generalized virtue of the  larger community, and both grow evermore sophisticated via this dialectical exploration. This  thesis asserts that the system which can be constructed from these traditions is not only preferable,  but logically sound, just, and attainable.
