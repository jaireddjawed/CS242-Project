        "text": "Unpopular opinion: The Whitebeard pirates put up a really bad fight at Marineford.\n\nI absolutely love Whitebeard but his battle against the Marines was a really bad showing.\n\nThe big shots from the other side who emerged almost unscathed are way too many: Mihawk, Doffy, Kuma, Aokiji, Kizaru, Garp, Sengoku, Boa, and even Akainu to an extent as he went on to chase Blackbeard pirates a while later. It goes on to show how far the Marines were from actually losing.\n\nOfcourse it was about freeing Ace and not just destroying the Marines and they almost succeeded at it too but after his death, he and his crew should have put a bigger dent on the Marine fighting forces IMO.\n\nNot to mention Luffy and his team's involvement was massive but that could be said that Whitebeard as a general is so incredible that he was able to utilise unexpected allies to his maximum advantage.\n\nIt's still shocking to see how little damage WB and his gang did to Marines, especially after Ace's death.",

I think I saw somebody here mention that idea before, referring to the SBS sketch of Teach as a child, which has the moon prominently in the background. Blackbeard seems to know a lot, so would he perhaps know about this, but lie about it to Ace and others? \n\nWe \"know\" that Whitebeard's Gura Gura is a Paramecia ability, so if we connect Blackbeard's three-skulls flag to his multiple fruit phenomenon, it suggests that he'll get one ability of each type. Back in the day we assumed that meant that he would get/reveal a Zoan ability at some point in the future, but if the Yami Yami is actually a Zoan, that old theory would require him to steal a Logia ability. And if he does need a sweet Logia fruit, and is the incarnation of a moon god, there's a certain villain who needs to return to the story...",

        "text": "Alright so this might be a little out there, but it has to do with the unique eyes of some characters. \n\nNotably, Mihawk, Zunisha, Imu, Cavendish, and Luffy while in gear 5 (very important) having double pupils. \n\nI believe this is a characteristic of gods. Or at the very least, a long living (if not naturally immortal like elves) species that has godlike qualities and immense power. \n\nLet me go one by one. \n\nCavendish: this one is the outlier, but he‚Äôs unique enough where it could be possible. He could be a god of dreams or cavendish himself could be half god species (same as Imu), with it coming out when he sleeps. We also know Hakuba is incredibly powerful.\n\nZunisha: I still believe that Zunisha is actually related to Imu, either a sibling or his/ her child, that was punished for siding with Joyboy, but too valuable (emotionally or otherwise) to Imu to be killed. So Zunisha was forced to wonder the world, possibly stuck in the zoan transformation of a mythical zoan, world elephant (from Hindu it is an elephant that Carrie‚Äôs the world on its back, Zunisha has zou, it fits quite well). I believe we may see him being liberated by the reincarnation of Joyboy (our main man Luffy) at the end of the story. \n\nImu: self explanatory really. Widely assumed to be have been given the immortality fruit gift (possible red herring), but I don‚Äôt believe this to be true, because then why would Zunisha still be alive as well? They must be a long living species. If not naturally invulnerable to death by aging. \n\nMihawk: I would not be surprised at this point if Mihawk is of the same species as Imu and Zunisha. We know he‚Äôs not that old, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean he isn‚Äôt from their lineage or same species. With Ryuma being declared sword god, and knowing now Zoro is related to him, defeating an actual ‚Äúgod‚Äù that is also the worlds strongest swordsman currently, is a way for Zoro to be the first Sword God since Ryuma. Mihawk is his dragon. More evidence supporting this is what zoro said on egghead. ‚ÄúYou actually seem more human than him‚Äù. Interesting. We know that the Mihawk seraphim has green blood, derived from Mr.1, a human. So having his blood in him, would make him more human if he wasn‚Äôt a human to begin with.\n\n\nFinally, Luffy:\nJoyboy is also from the same species as Imu/ Zunisha. But they aren‚Äôt related. Joyboy is from a different family, the rightful rulers of the ancient kingdom. Imu, wanting to rule himself, created the world government to overthrow the rightful heir, Joyboy, who didn‚Äôt want to rule. He was going to relinquish rule to the people, liberating them. This infuriated Imu to a point where he/ she framed the ancient kingdom using his/ her island destroying power, in order to unite other islands against the ancient kingdom and overthrow them. This is why when Luffy goes into G5. His eyes become, the eyes of a god. \n\nThis is the world governments secret, Imu framed the ancient kingdom, and we all know the victor gets to write history. Unless the losing party writes their side of it on indestructible stones.",

I know that Nami is navigator and in One Piece universe it is important job. \nLike in my mind Zoro is protector of the group and usually we see him only fighting to save others. So I think that it would be interesting see other crew to save him and maybe get see other side of Zoro than stone faces fighter who doesn't do anything else. I want see more Zoro in different situations like before time skip when he was babysitting three babys. And maybe this way we can get Zoro centric arc.",

        "text": "This is not a theory, this is just what I thought would be great to witness in a final saga, if we are touching a topic of death and a sacrifice of Strawhats members. I know there were a lot of theorys/speculations that Usopp will die, and my thoughts are similar to it  \n\n\nBasically what I thought off, is that a final battle of one piece goes on (besides from the final war) to get a King of Pirates status, between Strawhats and Blackbeard pirates. All Blackbeard's pirates are defeated, but the rest of strawhats besides Luffy and Usopp are so exhausted that they can't move an inch. Blackbeard gets an insane powerup, and he defeats Luffy (but doesn't kill him obviously) and Usopp is the last standing strawhat, but he broke his slingshot in a battle with Van Aungur, the only thing he has is a lingshot's string. He can't do nothing against Blackbeard, runs away, but Blackbeard catches him and Usopp loses his arm, and his bone is sticking out. He is screaming, but after some time of getting himself together, uses his bone and the string as a slingshot. Uses his strongest, yet unrevealed, special attack that is as strong as slight nuke, and Usopp goes on a kamikaze suicidal attack blowing up both him and Teach screaming \"Luffy will become the king of pirates!\"  \n\n\nProbably what I wrote looks like some 10yo's fanfic about Usopp finally being a hero of the sea, but I just thought that it would be cool to see in anime where almost no one dies in 1000+ chapters/episodes (i'm prepared to get downvoted as hell for this senseless wall of text i just posted)",

That theory also aligns with the goals of several of the straw hat members\n\nFranky - There is a big chance that Franky has memorized the blueprint of Pluton before he burned.  So he could possibly have already built 1000 sunny with the weapon Pluton inside making the ship he built the ultimate weapon that destroys the redline\n\nNami - She would be the first person to map the new world without the Red Line\n\nRobin - Her translation ponyglyph could ultimately lead to Mary Geoise where the world nobles are located \n\nSanji - He was the main reason I believe the one piece is actually destruction of one piece.   His dream ultimately is to see the All Blue.  I don‚Äôt think all blue as of now is currently possible with red line in the way.  I guess you call the reverse mountain all blue but that‚Äôs the first place they visited so I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs that.  Sanji‚Äôs goal go hand in hand with the destruction of red line\n\nLufy - His dream to become a pirate king is so that he can be the freest person in the world.  Destroying the redline would allow him to travel freely around the world\n\nFishmen Island - It was prophesied that Lufy will lead to the destruction of fishmen island.  I think that makes sense since fishmen island is directly under Mary Geoise and the redline therefore destroying the redline would lead to destruction of fishmen island.   Also the ship Nova is prophesized to be used at the right time by the sea kings.   Wouldn‚Äôt the right time be when the red line gets destroyed?  And the ship like the biblical counterpart would save the people and bring them to the new world.\n\nI mean one piece could be completely something else.  But I think destruction of redline has been heavily implied throughout the show",

        "text": " I feel like One Piece, the series, is lot more surreal than we might understand. It's a post-apocalyptic environment where the current world  is only \\~800 years old. Even before the revelations in Egghead, I've  always felt something was off from this world. We have time travel,  cyborgs, aliens, magic (devil fruits in a way) etc that's beyond real  life comprehension and I can't help wonder how technologically advanced  the ancient kingdom was. I feel like they were space explorers, or at  least reached the moon(s), and had knowledge that we irl don't have today. Like, Devil Fruits are magical items that are born from the  desires of humans, but to recreate them requires tech beyond our understanding of how things work. Turning people into stone or creating  weapons out of your body or whatever tf Kuma does, it's almost reality  warping science, because how does that stuff even work on an atomic  level? Being able to repel intangible concepts such as memories. \n\nThe ancient kingdom was far more advanced than we think if Vegapunk was able  to recreate these things with the science left behind from the AK. But  it also kind makes me think of the real world and how there are  conspiracies about the Illuminati that keep us in the dark about the true nature of our  world. The gorosei and Morgans both write the news in a way to tell a  story, and I can't help but think this happens irl. My focus in One Piece is learning the lore, and I hope it's as deep as I think it is.\n\n*Tl;dr the ancient kingdom had reality warping technology in order for Vegapunk and co to recreate devil fruits*\n\nSide note: I think the One Piece is a time capsule of sorts. Which is why Roger was too early.",

His father was a military man, but let's just say that his mother didnt exactly woo him.\n\nSo a similar thing could have happened to Garp, where he was forced into a marriage with a Celestial dragon. They then made Dragon and Dragon was raised as a celestial dragon.\n\nDragon grew up as a Celestial dragon, but he had a Mjosgard or Homing moment and decided to change the world.\n\nHence why he is called the \"rebellious dragon\". Similar to Doflamingo being called the \"heavenly demon\"\n\nHe likely had Luffy's mom to inspire him to go against his people.\n\nSo Luffy probably gets his more crude moments and funloving personality from his mom since Dragon is more serious barring his nosepicking.",

Both kuma and the ancient robot showed a rushing attempt of selfishness and disturbing their surroudings. \n\nshaka stated egghead island and its technology is replicating technology from the ancient kingdom. \n\nThe ancient kingdom was attacked by the 20 kingdoms, which formed the world government. CP agents and the navy are infiltrating and attacking egghead island. \n\n**speculation**\n\nshaka being a clone of IMU before he recieved the Devil fruit-based surgery for immortality. The gorosei member is targeting shaka. shaka being  a failed cloned of IMU. York turning to stone tempoariliy stops the metabolism of the vegapunks to survive longer without food. Joyboy stranded onto the ancient kingdom by accident and explored it. Perhaps when luffy entered the facility the food dish hologram and its size was offered becuase Luffy and his similiarity to nika the sun god, joyboy, was recognized by something and it was theorized joyboy being a giant due to the large straw hat kept inside marie jois etc. Perhaps if technology if replicating the ancient kingdom's technology, then punk records also has a foundation for its development based on technology from the ancient kingdom. Perhaps Egghead island is the traitor, some sort of AI system is controlling Egghead island. Vegapunk has a collection of failed prototypes, the pink colored dragon devil fruit, the light saber, and therfore doubt about all the vegapunk versions being perfect. It is mysterious a gorosei member and with too many navy ships and an admiral to visit egghead island while Luffy the yonko is there. Perhaps if the fact of luffy being on egghead island, and the aid from the government is too that amount, then the value of something on egghead island is too high and needed to be obtained. \n\nRemarks:\n\nOP: *sorry, and perhaps it was interesting to read this post.*",

I expected Usopp to have more strategic fights since he upgraded his arsenal and has probably upgraded his sniper skills, not to mention he also unlocked his observation haki.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUsopp was the only character who actually used strategy to fight his opponents which I used to enjoy wondering what he would do next but he hasn't had a proper fight in post timeskip. Of course he will get his spotlight in Elbaf but why can't he get it in other arcs. Wano was supposed to be Zoro's arc but he still got great moments in the prior arcs so it desn't make sense why Usopp doesn't get that much relevancy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost of the best Usopp moments I can think of came in pre timeskip. Shooting the flag, his Alabasta moment where he declares that Luffy will become the pirate king, His attachement to Merry, his fight with Luffy, his speech to Luffy, his interaction with Robin. Usopp had so many great moments pre timeskip but the only thing I can think of in post timeskip is his observation haki awakening.",

First off law isn't an idiot he always has a plan on what he's doing next so I find it very weird that when deciding where to go he immediately picked his own direction separate from kid and luffy and laughed at them for choosing the middle route. It's like he knew something we didn't\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zqyrz51e1bma1.png?width=2160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=20042e4c7a46c5a22a730abca9410d59058337f4\n\nSecond is his fight with bb itself and how he seemed confident in himself smiling at BB which is something law doesn't do unless he thinks he has a chance. He's not like luffy and kid who run into dangerous situations smiling sure they can win a fight without anything backing it just their guts. Law is smart and cunning if he‚Äôs confident then he must think he can win this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eacfs3ig1bma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3658d5468c3e657768c470c26ae247a81b014694\n\n Now oda made sure to limit BB here\n\nHe's missing commanders and only brought one ship with him It's BB who went into this and picked a fight This isn't like ace who went in to attack bb on his own while BB was with all of his crew ( at the time ) now it‚Äôs Blackbeard who is over confident and cocky.\n\nThen there's laws crew putting up an actual fight which no one suspected however the one character we should have our eyes on in this fight is law‚Äòs trump card, bepo.\n\nThis is what oda had to say on bepo.\n\n\"Q: Hello Odacchi, judging from the color spread of chapter 1031, Bepo is the No.2 of Heart Pirates?! I was surprised since I thought him, Penguin, and Shachi are all No.2s. So is Bepo (sulong form?) the strongest out of them?\"\n\nOda: \"talking about that color spread huh. Same goes for Zoro, not everyone on there holds the position of vice captain. They are just the No.2s that I picked out. Penguin and Shachi are more reliable in normal circumstances, but those two have seen Bepo's sulong transformation, so they acknowledge that \"combat wise Bepo is superior!\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bo0dzb25gbma1.jpg?width=945&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5e9c3dba8d49c5ef1a68eb79e7dd20f569d1daf1\n\nOda acknowledged bepo is a beast in sulong form not to be messed with and the fact we haven't seen it to me suggest we will see it soon\n\nNow how?\n\nIs it just coincidence that there will be a full moon now ?\n\nWell I think there is a technique that can allow minks to go sulong without the moon but it's incredibly dangerous\n\nAll minks have this ability to go sulong the moon doesn't give them this power it just triggers them, which means this power to go sulong is always in them which means all they need to do is find another trigger There is this ability that's been in our faces all the time but we don't really notice it It's called bio feedback, The ability to controls every aspect of one's body.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqzt5a9pgbma1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=41eb2cacbf2be0eff7f0a4e5170475fb9bb2b640\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wwu4a9pgbma1.jpg?width=360&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4cd538365dc3412f5e65e56e49dce835b205fd8e\n\nLucci used this manoeuvre to make himself smaller which weakened him but made him faster.\n\nif a mink can learn this ability they can go sulong whenever they wish no moon required.\n\nthis can also be forced.  Chopper the worlds best doctor created the rumble ball which I believed allows him to alter his zoan body whatever way he chooses \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u70vxe96hbma1.jpg?width=589&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e78e97e41c5c23d807fdf9e5d1d47bdd21ec20b1\n\nsimilarly law the worlds best surgeon probably knows a way to force it as well. This is why I think law will use his room on bepo triggering a reaction forcing bepo to go sulong which will also hinder the crew  as I don‚Äôt believe bepo can control the form.\n\nThere is also another way. \n\nbig moms crew.\n\nOn BB ship right now is pudding.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/zvk24jw4ibma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a2f93bdd8703354f09d434cc3756c9a4442e3f03)\n\nso it‚Äôs only a matter of time before katakuri comes to save her, how does he find her.\n\n1. Vivi has a vivre card\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jqsu3gvcibma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=21dd95985f51c4535d2e792b5cc613b4abeccd8c\n\nWe see what looks like pieces of paper around her hands If she has a vivre card then katakuri can follow it\n\n2. Is br√ºl√©e\n\nIn the cover we see aokiji froze the entire town\n\nCracker was turned to ice everyone was iced except br√ºl√©e \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ts81xn9pibma1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4aece837267b068a49511f18fb4b48e3dc5372e4\n\nIf she acts quick enough br√ªl√©e could have gotten on the bb ship if they have a mirror on board and she's been hiding in the mirror world contacting katakuri giving him updates on BB activity Katakuri shows up and bb seeing more numbers being added will decide it's not worth it and flees Now this doesn't necessarily save law as katakuri could also be a problem for him but 1 step at the time So I think law can come out of this relevantly fine",

Water 7, Enies Lobby and Marineford had some of the best looking panels in the entire series and Fishman Island just looks so clean. \n\nPunkhazard was also the first arc where i noticed that Oda was starting to adapt the more compressed paneling that is the common standart for the later arcs in the post timeskip era.",

He is a character filled with madness, rage, sadness and roaring hatred toward the society and the world. Every time I heard his psychotic laugh all I feel is underwhelming sorrow and pain he could never got rid of. His childhood fortified his inescapable suffering inside him which is extremely sad. His evilness rooted from his desperation, and that turned him into a residue of fate.

        "text": "Reading Egghead island, we get introduced to the idea of a traitor among Vegapunk and his Stella. But then I started thinking, why? Why would there be a traitor? I doubt it's just for money and if the data bank of Vegapunk get destroyed or something they all die, since it's essentially his brain. \n\nI thought about it, but I can't really think of a reason for why a traitor would need to be introduced, the government already can control the seraphim with the Gorosei, which, would you know? Has just arrived at Egghead, and since Vegapunk apparently never thought of a failsafe on the seraphim, Oda could easily write it with Saturn being the one ordering the Seraphim to rebel against Vegapunk. \n\nIt wouldn't even be a particular shocking twist if it was one of the Vegapunk because we just got introduced to them, unlike the whole traitor plot of Kanjuro which was set much earlier than its reveal. \n\nAnd if it's just to not make every Stella sail on the Sunny, either make them taken out by the Seraphim/CP0/Kizaru&amp;Saturn. Or even don't create the Stella in the first place and just keep Vegapunk. \n\nSo all in all, this whole traitor betraying the other Vegapunk and taking them down seems superflous, considering there were already enough elements to the plot even without it. \n\nI'm not all against the idea but, it does seems pretty superfluous now and really just to make the arc longer.",

Fighting an admiral- I could see this happening but it would have to be Fujitora or Greenbull seeing as Kizaru is going to egghead and Akainu is busy behind a desk. I would assume fujitora since him and Mihawk would likely clash swords.\n\n2. Invading Impel Down- this one in my opinion is the most likely option just because both Buggy and Crocodile have connections there and potentially rescuing Doffy  would be really hype (fits the warlords theme). Also Crocodile might get a scene with Bon Clay. A really cool fight that could also happen would be Mihawk or Crocodile vs Magellan. It would go so hard. \n\n3. A combo of the two but I doubt this would happen\n\nNow seeing how Oda has been teasing us with Shanks vs Kidd and Blackbeard vs Law, I would imagine that we wouldn‚Äôt get the full meat of the encounter which is unfortunate.\n\nWhat do you all think?",

        "text": "I'll go straight to the point. I've noticed that the 4 aces of card games (diamonds‚ô¶Ô∏è, clubs‚ô£Ô∏è, hearts‚ô•Ô∏è, spades‚ô†Ô∏è) all represent some major character that has died in One piece and whose death has been significantly important to the story. The spades obviously represent Ace, because spades are his jolly roger. Ace's death is probably the most important death in One piece, because it has directly affected the main character, more than any other death. Then the clubs represent Clover. The clubs are actually clovers, and we know Clover was killed in the Ohara incident, another big event that we all know what has brought in the story (it has shaped the ideals of Robin, Aokiji, Dragon etc). Now it comes to the remaining 2: hearts and diamonds. The hearts represent either Corazon or Law. I'm not yet calling Law's death because for now we have no news on his battle against Blackbeard. Anyway if he survives I think he will have an important role later in the story. If he survives, my guess is that he will be revealed to be a member of SWORD. What I think the hearts represent is Corazon. His name literally means \"heart\" in Spanish. His death has been so important that has basically made Law's character: everything about Law revolves around Corazon (heart pirates, his fruit etc). Also Corazon is the one that has revealed that the D members are sworn enemies of the celestial dragons. Lastly we have the diamonds, but for that I don't have an answer. It could represent Whitebeard, and the fact that he revealed that the existence of the One piece is real. You could also say like Jozu, but we yet don't know if he's dead, and also I don't see some major repercussions on the endgame story. Any ideas are well accepted.",

But yea mihawks one of my personal favorites he has to be top 5 I feel like he gotta be the best observation haki user with future sight..he told perona I think that's her name she should leave he could see the marines abolishing the warlords and knew it wouldn't be safe for her. I'm not saying he's stronger than shanks overall but swordsmanship wise he is. I feel like shanks may only have better conquerors haki then him maybe. But mihawks gotta be top observation and maybe armament haki to. We never seen him go all out and to be real I don't think we seen him even try he looks like he's always half assing lol just my opinion tho.",

Doffy accept his brother to his group years later cause yeah blood brother until he found out he snitched and betrayed him the whole time so he kill him. Nothing wrong with that. Doflamingo only try to kill someone in his \"family\" that try to snitched on him like violet and corazon.",
