        "text": "Hello! I thought I'd share my experience/\"regimen\" with trying to learn languages while having ADHD. \n\nFor one, that whole \"focus on one language, stick to it, choose a time of day, and study for 30 minutes\" never worked. Instead, it killed my interest in so many languages so quickly- and I never felt as though I made much progress. I'd study for maybe a week before I'd forget one day, decide I didn't actually care that much, and drop it. \n\nSo I came up with something of a chaotic method. For one, I'm studying three languages at once(Spanish, Malay, Mandarin). I have these spiral notebooks, and I'll just list vocabulary that I find useful (how to write it, how it sounds, english translation). One word per line, and I'll stop when it fills the page. \n\nSo, when I get in the mood to study, I surround myself with the notebooks (semicircle style), and jump around with the words I memorize. Bored of a language? That's okay, let's jump to this notebook instead. It might take me a week to memorize the page, when it should take a day, but that interest is retained and I'm drawing connections between the languages. \n\nSo I'm just constantly jumping between the languages, memorizing random words and making up sentences (typically rudimentary). At one point or another, I'll likely end up on a tangent, and do a deep dive into a very niche topic that I have no business in yet üòÇ. But that's good, because even if I'm spending less time learning the language, I'm growing an interest in the language itself rather than the utility of it. \n\nFrom there, I'll typically watch like 5 minutes of Peppa pig in the language to test my listening comprehension(just because notebooks aren't gonna help so much with an accent). \n\nAnd probably the most important part is being on the subreddits. Because I'll typically go on a tangent, before I go to bed I'll try to post a question on the tangent, and then shut off my phone. That way, when I wake up the next day, my interest in the language is renewed, my question answered, and I'll want to study again. \n\nSo it's definitely not efficient. And it's not exactly practical, and it's far more time consuming, and I'm probably more prone to errors. But I've found this to be the best way to study with ADHD - the only way that's been working longer term. Because the biggest obstacle when studying language with ADHD isn't the grammar, or the writing system, or the tones or pronunciation- but interest. So my way of studying is entirely about not only maintaining but strengthening that interest.",

This can also be done with other programs like Evernote, Google Docs, etc.\n\nObviously if you don't use or make your own flashcards then this doesn't apply to you, but I just wanted to share this as I think it may help some people.\n\nHappy learning!",

A lot of the podcasts seem to be super basic (i.e. spending a LOT of time with just konnichiwa and ogenki desu ka) or they jump into 100% Japanese mode. I am looking for something that is moving towards Japanese immersion, but still has English scaffolding to help explain some of the trickier words/ phrases/ nuances/ etc. A good equivalent that I am looking for would be the Coffee Break Language series or Popup Chinese for Mandarin and Cantonese. \n\nI love Momoko to Nihongo, and Japanese Pod has stellar content as well. If there are any other recommendations out there, I‚Äôd appreciate knowing what your other favorite podcasts are!",

        "text": "Learn and comprehend Spanish, French, Korean, Bisaya, Tagalog (any language) with ease using Parallel Text\n\nLearning via sentence mining or parallel text gives you an idea in what context a given word can be used\n\nI developed a language learning tool called Parallel Text\n\nTo temper your expectation on machine translation. Machine translation is still not perfect but it‚Äôs noticeably improving in these past years\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Parallel Text running on Safari](https://preview.redd.it/3w7xn7rclmna1.png?width=1067&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7f6e51f21dfb38a129d0f55adc44f206aac30c00)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Parallel Text running on Chrome](https://preview.redd.it/u3xpj4fflmna1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=44fd3335b942f7390dfa423c2e243a9d3f7368e7)\n\nFirst rule when learning via parallel text, don‚Äôt translate content from your native language to your target language. Instead, read content from your target language, then translate it to your native language; on that setup, as we know our native language well, our mind will have an easier way of rectifying and filling in some gaps and flaws of the machine when it did not accurately translate to your native language. Second rule, there‚Äôs no second rule\n\nOn Parallel Text, to see the native language of the target language, learners need to hover the cursor over the phrase/sentence of the target language, then the matching phrase on the native language will be highlighted in green\n\nParallel Text‚Äôs matching (of target and native language) is bite-sized, it does not highlight the whole paragraph nor the whole sentence; instead, its basic unit of highlighting of the matching contents between the target language and native language is phrase-based. It‚Äôs easier to digest bite-sized information \n\nThere are two flavors of Parallel Text. Why two flavors? It‚Äôs due to what browser the learner is using\n\nFirst flavor, Chrome. I mentioned that Parallel Text‚Äôs basic unit of highlighting is phrase-based. What that means is that, under-the-hood the phrases (of both target and native languages) are boxed in their own tags so that the target and the native languages can be matched when users hover over the phrases of either language. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your perspective/preference), Chrome‚Äôs built-in translation works in the same manner too, that is, it translates language by each box\n\ne.g., On Chrome, this..\n\n**‚Äú¬øSe centralizar√≠a, a√∫n m√°s, el poder?‚Äù**\n\n..is translated as:\n\n**‚ÄúWould it centralize, even more, the power?‚Äù**\n\nIt does not sound natural on your native language (e.g., English), for some, that is a drawback; as you know your native language well, it makes reading the translation a bit jarring. However, for some learners, it‚Äôs a good factor; while you are learning a target language, you can gauge immediately how your target language‚Äôs grammar is structured\n\nCan Chrome‚Äôs translation be more accurate? Yes, by boxing the parallel text by sentence instead of phrase. It will be translated like this:\n\n**‚ÄúWould power be further centralized?‚Äù**\n\nYou might ask, why Parallel Text boxed them by each phrase then? Despite that disadvantage, boxing by phrase makes it easier for the learner to map the target language‚Äôs words to their native language‚Äôs words even without the aid of a dictionary\n\nHmm.. perhaps I should make an option on Parallel Text so the learner can set the boxing either by phrase or by sentence, some learners already have a dictionary extension :)\n\nNow on second flavor, Safari. Parallel Text‚Äôs basic unit of highlighting on Safari is phrase-based too. However, Safari‚Äôs built-in translation can break out of those boxes. When I first discovered this, it stumped me why Safari does seem to highlight only one word on the phrase I‚Äôm hovering on my target language. e.g., \n\nÁé∞ÂºÄÂèë. Áé∞ = first, ÂºÄÂèë = develop. When I hovered on Áé∞ÂºÄÂèë, Safari highlights the **develop** only, it does not highlight the word **first**. It turns out, despite the boxes for each phrase, Safari just ignores them and translate the whole sentence instead. Consequently, the words in a box are split apart! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CWS's Parallel Text running on Safari](https://preview.redd.it/7cjsmsoplmna1.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0a1d58aa59c61a8c2f4be18fb6e907fda50f0596)\n\nTechnically, Áé∞ and ÂºÄÂèë are still in identical boxes, but it is cloned and split apart by Safari. So I need to make Parallel Text identify those clones and highlight them at the same time. See the ‚Äúfix‚Äù for Safari below. Note, the screenshot below (and above) is from Chinese words separator‚Äôs Parallel Text. I extracted CWS‚Äôs Parallel Text so that it can be used on other languages too, not just on Chinese\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CWS's Parallel Text running on Safari](https://preview.redd.it/5yjzc1tvlmna1.png?width=1254&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dba492508678f10eac4a25a50140f21f3a317b4c)\n\nSafari‚Äôs translation mechanism makes the translation to learner‚Äôs native language read more natural and accurate. Some may argue that it‚Äôs not readily apparent how the target language‚Äôs grammar is structured if machine translation render the translation to the structure of the grammar of the learner‚Äôs native language accurately. Learners can figure it out though, as Parallel Text can map (by underlining and highlighting) the target language‚Äôs words to the learner‚Äôs native language words even if those words are split apart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are more examples of Parallel Text running on Safari: [https://www.anicehumble.com/2023/01/improvement-chinese-words-separator-parallel-text-highlighting-safari.html](https://www.anicehumble.com/2023/01/improvement-chinese-words-separator-parallel-text-highlighting-safari.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn contrast to Safari, Chrome can‚Äôt break out of those phrases' box. Following is Chrome‚Äôs result of the same content above. Then again, the result below is the better one to those who prefer too see the structure of the target language as-is\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[CWS's Parallel Text running on Chrome](https://preview.redd.it/1bd5yrwylmna1.png?width=1277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6ceae1b7dd2e836089b3f7b41056eaad2d60d60e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTested on \n\n[https://juejin.cn/post/7025868886914400293](https://juejin.cn/post/7025868886914400293)\n\n[https://elpais.com/planeta-futuro/2023-03-09/la-inteligencia-artificial-puede-contribuir-a-transformar-la-sociedad-hacia-la-sostenibilidad.html](https://elpais.com/planeta-futuro/2023-03-09/la-inteligencia-artificial-puede-contribuir-a-transformar-la-sociedad-hacia-la-sostenibilidad.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo use Parallel Text\n\non Chrome: [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/parallel-text/ccmjdgjljbhkkhhgdabpdkjhnningbdc](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/parallel-text/ccmjdgjljbhkkhhgdabpdkjhnningbdc)\n\non Safari browsers for Mac, iPhone, iPad: [https://apps.apple.com/app/parallel-text/id6446043517](https://apps.apple.com/app/parallel-text/id6446043517)\n\nTo use on Android, install Kiwi browser first: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser).

I've already heard about those open courses taught by colleges, like English or German, but as it pays, I'd like to have some feedback. I'm already on Duolingo (lol that doesn't count) and I read English books quite regularly. Those exams (fce, cae...) are out of the question because they will only be useful to me when I enter the job market and they are valid for 2 years, which is not my case at the moment. Thank you guys!",

I tried searching for some online ways to learn Arabic but were for no use.\nI know just a couple of words of Arabic which are common with my native language and some of the words repeated many times in the Qur'an. \nI want to know if y'all can suggest some books and some online course through which i can learn Arabic?\nThe worst part is Arabic has a very vast grammar and being grammatically correct in Arabic is hard. Is there any way I can learn it from this level?",

I am interested in techniques to improve language switching, i.e. improving language suppression of a non-target language and active production of a target language.\n\nFor context, I am a native English speaker and am working on improving my French (C1) and Spanish (B2). If I am practicing both languages regularly, I find that in French conversation, I sometimes have Spanish words bubbling up in my brain first (but not English) and in Spanish conversation, I sometimes find myself thinking of French vocab first. I occasionally will also verbally mix French and Spanish.\n\nI do not seem to have trouble suppressing English and I also don‚Äôt seem to have trouble switching passive practice of French and Spanish, i.e. turning off a Spanish audiobook and moving to a French podcast. \n\nSo, it seems like my problem is just active language production and suppression of non-native languages. Is that a common experience? Do you know of techniques for more effective language switching? (Or is the answer just to improve my hold on both languages?)",
