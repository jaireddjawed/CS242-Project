Relationships.\n\nThese are what we call \"two-way streets\". It takes two to tango.\n\nThere's always give and take.\n\nSo where should that middle ground be?\n\n------------\n\nThe reason I ask is due to three distinct examples in the games I play, and the subs I frequent.\n\nFeel free to chime in if you've played these games, or if you've got some input in the other games you play.\n\n------------\n\n**Example One - Vermintide 2:**\n\nVermintide 2 released early in March, and within a week or so has sold more copies than the original had in its three-year lifespan. Thousands more gamers played it, but a lot of people also recognized that the game had some bugs.\n\nThe game itself, while it had issues, remained fun with well-polished visuals and atmosphere, engaging and challenging gameplay, and hit all the right notes of what a coop-FPS/FPM (melee) game set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe should be... *all for the measly price of $15 (currency converted to my local one).* And, in spite of these issues, the developers have also released multiple updates and patches tirelessly (around 5 in less than a month).\n\nHowever, a lot of gamers also became very vocal with these issues - the latest of which is the power and capability of heroes to stagger enemies.\n\nBefore, some players complained that the game was becoming too easy, and no longer challenging in the end.\n\nWhen a developer explained that this was due to a missing line of code, one of the most upvoted comments was [paraphrase]: *\"Lol! They screwed up, how simple! So funny!\"*\n\nThat missing line of code apparently *'made your characters stronger than intended'*.\n\nWhen players found out about this, many freaked out - because it meant you'd be weaker, and thus the game would be harder.\n\nSo yes, we had folks who were complaining about needing a challenge; to laughing that a game had a bug; to becoming angered that fixing that bug would make the game more challenging. Whoops!\n\nAnd added into the mix are, of course, the most vocal ones with the oft-repeated justification: *\"we're only this way because we want the game to improve\"* - which everyone literally wants. But then, you'll also have to consider how these reasoning came about.\n\nFor instance, some gems of replies I found:\n\n- *\"They're releasing a game with bugs; they can't afford testers? They're making us their testers instead?\"*\n- *\"You say video games have bugs like it's a fact of life! It shouldn't be! We should be within our rights to complain! These bugs are unacceptable!\"*\n- *\"Look at games like Overwatch and Diablo 3! Now those are good games!\"* (in a discussion about games that launched which had no major issues, -snort-)\n- *\"There are bugs in the game and what we fear is that the developers will just abandon it completely!\"* (in a game that sold more in two weeks than its predecessor did in three years, yep...)\n\nAnd a couple of hilarious comparisons to a \"Video game with bugs\" and \"Game development/programming\":\n\n- *\"It's like if I bought a car with its windows broken.\"*\n- *\"It's like if I got a table and the legs are missing.\"*\n- *\"It's like if I ordered a burger and there was no lettuce, and I specifically asked for lettuce.\"*\n\nSources: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/87jn71/developer_acknowledges_bug_with_hero_power_scaling/); [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/87uttt/update_on_the_upcoming_patch_from_steam_discussion/); [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/85sevx/every_time_a_new_patch_comes_it_fixes_a_bunch_of/); and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermintide/comments/85ptf8/vermintide_2_how_to_provide_constructive/)\n\n----------------\n\n**Example 2 - Destiny 2:**\n\nDestiny 2 has had a litany of issues in the past months, most notably because despite of all the hype, it just was a disappointing sequel. I know, I'm a D1 vet who slogged through three years of the first game, and yet found that the second game made it *'too easy for me to get stuff'* that I had nothing else to do after three weeks.\n\nStill, the Destiny community is one of the most vocal ones - and yet - far too often, it sets a certain goal post that developers need to meet... *or else*.\n\n&gt; (Issue A) One good example would be during the holidays (2017) when people wanted communication but weren't getting much since, well, it was the holidays. People just wanted to know what's in store for the game, and wanted to see the changed that were planned so that it will improve.\n\nOn January 2018, the first communication arrived. And people still remained angry - *(a) because the changes/improvements would take time and not happen instantly; (b) the changes/improvements should have been part of the game from the start; (c) the changes/improvements should not be given praise until we're back to the state of the first game.*\n\nSo yes - we went from wanting communication and answers and a clear plan... to suddenly not being happy that we received those.\n\n&gt; (Issue B) Months ago, players also felt that, in order to make the game more fun, we needed to have faster charging abilities and supers; and we needed to move, glide, and jump faster than before - it was, what was called, the *'power fantasy'* and *'hero moments'* - some arcadey stuff going on that looked spectacular. Last December when a minor event did just that, not a single person complained because everyone was having fun in that mode (barring some exploiters of course). People just wanted faster charging abilities, and faster zooming around.\n\nThen as time went on, people felt there was a 'magic bullet' that would save the game - and this was, well, just making primary weapons kill faster. That was it. It's the great problem solver. This mentality spread throughout a huge portion of the community.\n\nWhen an update arrived that did give 'faster charging and faster zooming' - a lot of people became upset (even without trying it) - because they moved on from wanting that, and instead felt that *'the magic bullet of faster primary weapon kills'* is the new answer.\n\n&gt; (Issue C) And finally, in the past, people were angry that certain activities did not have exclusive item drops like ships or shells or weapons. They wanted them as part of the rewards pool again. When they finally arrived in a recent update - welp - many folks felt that *'nope, not what we wanted, we need more'*.\n\nSo essentially - we had a game that was flawed (fact), and we had a community that wanted it to improve (fact) - but each and everytime a goal is achieved, that goal post is moved again and again; to the point that, well, you have a lot of disgruntled players who forgot what they wanted initially.\n\nSources: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/88137d/on_outrage_part_2_and_how_the_community_tends_to/); [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/89ral2/on_outrage_part_3_a_sense_of_loss_emotional/); and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/889k25/counterpoint_ttk_wont_solve_teamshooting/).\n\n--------------\n\n**Example 3 - Total War: Thrones of Britannia:**\n\nLast week, players found out that Ambushes would be removed from the next Total War game (a 'Saga' title which means it has a smaller scale than other bigger titles in the franchise). The community outrage was palpable because a lot of players felt that a feature was being taken out for a game; they needed answers - but could not wait until a community manager came back to work in a few days' time.\n\nWhen the representative did come back, he mentioned why ambushes were being removed:\n\n- statistically, only 0.05% of battles for a previous game (that Thrones' engine was based on) were ambush battles; this means almost no one bothered with them; *yes that's not even a full percent, that's HALF of a percent*\n- historically, based on the notable battles of the time period, ambush battles were hardly mentioned (ambushes did happen, just that they were not a major factor)\n- and in terms of content, the idea was to focus more on different features of the game (ie. 'make this game a bit different') - which means focusing on character development, progression, unique campaign goals, etc. (*sort of like giving it a more personal and rpg feel*)\n\nBut these explanations did not assuage the anger of some of the playerbase. Some notable replies included these gems:\n\n- *\"Why do they keep removing features, I don't understand? It's a $40 game!\"* (finding the equation of how much a gameplay feature is in relation to its pricing)\n- *\"They keep streamlining these games, what's next? If they keep doing this - in the future we'll only have one soldier and one battle for an entire game!\"* (yes, the slippery slope argument... that was less a slippery slope, and more of a hyperbolic nosedive to Hades)\n- *\"Why did they make this decision? They could have change it - like a change of 1%, or 5%, or something! It would be easy!\"* (a gamer with no experience on game development assuming something would be easy to do)\n- *\"You know which games retain their features every year? FIFA! And Sports games! They retain features and just update the rosters!\"* (praising a genre that has often been criticized for repackaging the same thing each year with very minor changes)\n- There's even a topic where someone asked for a boycott because he felt: *\"These are dangerous times for the franchise\"*\n\nYes - so a portion of the playerbase wanted answers, and did not like those answers because they did not fit to their own gamer's concept of what the game should be, and thus it turned more into pestering the developer.\n\nSources: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/88xncp/thrones_of_britannia_is_being_criticized_for_all/); [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/89q78a/ambushes_and_thrones/); and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/89rsbq/thrones_of_britannia_boycott_thread/)\n\n-------------\n\nThree examples in three different games.\n\nGamers want some things; gamers are not able to accept those things, or want more/something else.\n\nAs a gamer - where do you draw the line? Where is your middle ground?\n\nWhat is something that would lead you to accept what a video game is, and what a developer provides/communicates to you?\n\nAt what point do you go - *\"Ahhh, cool, got what I wanted out of my purchase\"*, versus *\"No, no, I need more; I demand more; this is not enough\"*?\n\nDo you feel that gamers in general need to be educated more about how game development works in order to have effective communication? Do you feel that developers should play a role in this, or should fellow gamers help inform others in the community?\n\n\nThank you for reading and for joining the discussion.\n\n-- EL2",

Skyrim, Watch Dogs (Both), Ghost Recon Wildlands, Horizon Zero Dawn, Any Assassin's Creed, Dying Light, Mafia 3....I could go on and on. \n\nBut I always, always freak out when I look at that big wide map. Add in a full log of quests and icons that I have no idea what they mean yet and it's just sensory overload.\n\nI eventually start to unpack it in bits and pieces until I get a rhythm and I have a great time. I love open world games, in general, and I don't think of it as a problem with the games individually. \n\nI wonder if this feeling of being overwhelmed is a design issue with open worlds or am I just a nervous nelly?",

        "text": "Amidst the memes. perhaps overwhelming character. and silly for-fun gameplay videos of newer titles, I truly do feel that with or without that, Dunkey is still one of the best gaming related content creators out there, making surprisingly thought provoking videos. Even if people know this already, I can't help but feel the want to share my love for his ability to create strong, concise videos.\n\nThe ones I will always come back to are his videos on [Cuphead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCkPhYiKbJU), [Sonic Mania](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwTejwu4oaw), and [Ocarina of Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duPynkGEFGI&amp;t), his review to be specific.\n\nBetween his ability to tell stories accentuating the empirical aspects of the game, like in his Cuphead and Sonic Mania videos, and his ability to meticulously craft a phrase into perfectly describing a game's aesthetic beauty like in Ocarina of Time, it's easy to forget how strong of a writer Dunkey is. \n\nPaired with his editing skills to manipulate clips in a concise, comical, and meaningful way, I feel he really proves a long time tenant of writing that shorter, trimmed down, quality writing is the reigning king. Especially where the diaspora on gaming is occasionally leading towards bloated, hour+ long exposes on why a game is overrated, or what have you. Dunkey proves his watchability thanks to his sub-ten-minutes bursts of genius.\n\nOf course, watch this videos again even if you have seen them already. My words can only do so much to demonstrate.\n\nWhat are some of your favorite Dunkey videos where he gets straight to the point?\n\nEdit: a word",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/89yydb/the_weirdness_of_game_review_scores/",
        "text": "I've been thinking about how strange it is that anything that scores below a 7/10 by a reviewer is really taken to mean it's not worth playing. Reasonably, a 5/10 should be a mediocre, average game, right? So a 6/10 would mean \"above average\". But in the gaming world it does *not* mean that. People will dismiss a 6 outright. A 7 is generally considered a disappointing score too, and fanboys will riot over a score like that.\n\nIt seems game scores are skewed one point above where they should be. 6 really means mediocre, a 7 is \"okay\" and a 5 is \"pretty bad\". Which makes no sense at all. If a game gets *below* a 5 it's implied that it's a genuinely awful game that isn't worth picking up, even in a sale. Scores of 1 - 4 all mean the exact same thing as each other really.\n\nDon't get me started on how a \"AAA\" game is almost guaranteed to get 7's or above unless it's a total failure, and publishers will consider even a 7 to be a failing score. It seems like we have a really unhealthy reviewing system, but I don't know if it can be fixed unless we scrap scores altogether at this point.\n\nIt's been like this for as long as I can remember though, maybe even before I was born. What caused this? and what is your opinion on it?",

Does making a tradeoff between mobility and accuracy improve gameplay or not? Is it possible to use or not use iron sights in a different way that they are usually used?",

Finding your way through immense garbage systems, or double-backing your way through conveyor-style assembly buildings has been a staple, but in JKII I have to say it feels a bit extreme. \n\nIt struck me that given they're replicating real places like docking stations, there would be public signage. The game is completely lacking in any kind of signs, labeling of areas, etc. There is no map, so you are forced to construct this foreign machination in your mind and try and guess where the Empire would put a control room. Oh, on the other side of the compound, through a door that doesn't look like a door? Great, thanks Imperial interior designer. (Imperior Designer?)\n\nBUT, man, I keep loading it back up. I'm feeling the same frustration I felt the first time around, but there is a distantly stored playthrough in my mind which is helping me out somewhat. Also the lightsaber and force mechanics just make it all worthwhile. Walking into a room and pushing 3 stormtroopers to the ground at once, or blocking their shots with your lightsaber while pulling their weapons from their hands, leaving them terrified and surrendering. It's fun every time, and I suppose it's those mechanics which bring me back. ",

        "text": "EDIT: it  seems the general consensus is that quests aren’t for people like me who have already invested hundreds of hours into a game and are rather for new players who haven’t got to grips with everything yet\n\nIn many of the multiplayer games I play that have quests in them tend their quests towards \"Play this type of character\" or \"Use this particular thing\". Examples of which being Hearthstones quest requirements of playing certain classes, or Battlerites requirements of player certain champions.\n\nI feel that all these quests that dictate how I'm supposed to play their game in order to enjoy the rewards simply serve to drive me away from the game. In Hearthstone if I re-roll my quest and get a second one that I dont want to play with, I literally just log off and wait for my next re-roll, rather than playing at all that day.\n\nWhy do quests in games such as these not tend towards simply \"Deal this much damage\" or \"Heal this much\"; Quantitative measurements that are regularly accrued, as opposed to the qualitative \"Did you do this binary thing or not\".\n\nThis allows me to continue playing the game the way I enjoy playing it, and ultimately keeps me playing longer. I personally would rather fulfil a quest in a sub-optimal, yet enjoyable way of my choosing that takes longer, than 'taking my medicine' and dealing with an unenjoyable experience for however long it takes me to complete the quest.\n\nWhat is the reason behind the design choice because I'm not under the illusion that I'm smarter than people who earn six figures designing games for a living, I just can't see it",

        "text": "Over the last couple of decades there have been multiple games that have tried to capture the essence of watching a movie when playing a game. I'd like to shine some light on a game that *I* feel captures that feeling, while at the same time providing engaging game play that goes beyond choose-your-own adventure mechanics and same-story-different-dialogue payoffs. A game where how you play can significantly change your journey. A 21 year-old game called Starfox 64.\n\n* Playing Star Fox 64 from start to finish takes a little bit more than an hour, which is as long or a bit shorter than the average movie. An easily digestible, yet not insignificant amount of content.\n\n* Star Fox 64 has *multiple victory conditions* that allow you to progress in the game. Depending on what conditions you meet your experience will be radically different.\n\n* Star Fox 64 has a fully voice acted story playing out in front of you. Not only is that impressive for the system, but the voices are delivered with such zeal and unironic ham that people find the quotes endearing to this day.\n\nWith some basic points out of the way, I'd like to call attention to the world map of the game, a map I affectionately call [The Casual Filter](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starfox/images/e/e5/Complete_lylat_map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20091025011045). Each stage is completely unique with it's own assets, dialogue, and challenges. Starting from Corneria, the player has two victory conditions. One for skilled players, and one for those good enough to survive, but not good enough to meet the 'hard path' victory condition. This multiple win condition pattern repeats itself through the game, allowing the player to claw their way to the top from the near bottom as late as Sector-X or fall back to the easy path if the hard path is just too much to handle. It is an ingenious piece of game design that rewards skill and offers accessibility, albeit flawed as many would agree that 'easy' stages like Titania are much harder than some of the Medium stages.\n\nThere are so many variables in this game and character interactions that only take place if you visit certain planets or save certain characters that you can play through the game a dozen times and not have the experience be the same. At the same time, it differs from rogue-lites like Faster Than Light and Binding of Isaac by having a more coherent plot and no randomly generated content. It is a perfect storm of digestible, varied yet predictable game play, and I feel it is a shame that we have not seen much like it 20 years after.\n\nThe game may very well have been a product of it's time. The expectations the players have on graphics in this day and age just don't line up with the time it takes to produce such graphics. Star Fox 64 was visually quite simplistic, even for it's time, and I just don't think developers these days have the heart to create 8 unique stages with unique assets that may never get used.\n\nStill. I think it is perhaps *the* game that merges the feeling of a movie-like story with solid game play where skill and decision making matters greatly to the experience. I'd love to hear your thoughts about the systems and other games that may have used similar structures.\n",

Maybe there were little black people around in Bohemia in early 15th Century *(I cannot say much because despite I am a fan of history, medieval history never really appealed to me)* but does it make it historically authentic to not have any people of colour appear in the game?\n\nSame thing that I have with other games which take place in historical settings such as COD WW2 has a female soldiers - it is authentic in some areas because female soldiers did exist in the case of the French resistance, the Polish resistance and the Russians, but there were never any female soldiers fighting in the front lines in the Allies side of the war *(no British or American female soldiers)*\n\nOr another game does not goes in a shady line of authenticity is the Assassin's Creed franchise and the Total War series. \n\nI play those games because they often portray historical settings as accurate as possible but they of course alter historical settings in certain ways such as Pope Alexander VI  was indeed a very controversial pope and fathered many children and Cesare Borgia was ruthless but there is little evidence to show that he had incest with his sister.\n\nHonestly, the whole topic regarding historical authenticity is a very controversial subject where there is a shady and murky where one can define a historical setting as authentic or non-authentic despite the creative liberties that developers have in order to make their games as appealing as possible",

But I assume government had a hand in getting all the companies to the table and negotiating the outcome.  And now all phones charge via USB.  Along with almost all other portable devices.\n\n\nNow that most controllers are USB / Bluetooth anyways (and work on PC), there should be a similar effort to make all the console manufacturers agree to let their controllers be cross-compatible.\n\n\nSure, different controllers have unique features (like the DS4's touchpad, or the Wii U's touchscreen), but there's no reason why the functions that are shared between controllers can't work on every console.  (ABXY, L1-3, R1-3, DPad, Analogue Sticks, Select, Start)\n\n\nTo be even more consumer friendly, the console makers should include a control remapping feature in their console OS's (like the one steam has.)   So you could map the DS4's touchpad to the touchscreen features of the Wii U, or stuff like that.\n\n\nThis is also a big deal for fightsticks, HOTAS, steering wheels, etc which never actually change but often don't work between different consoles (unless you get an adaptor.)\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/89alfu/what_do_you_think_about_autodynamicdifficulty/",
        "text": "- \"Videogames as we know them were built on the idea of challenge. Arcade games were always about (and still are about) getting as far as you can go, mastering the gameplay (or at least the minutiae of the levels) and going until you either ran out of money or you contracted premature arthritis in your wrists.\nAs games got more complicated the management of challenge turned into something of an art. Too much challenge, and players got frustrated and quit. Too little challenge, and players got bored and quit. So the idea of dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) was born.\nDDA is a relatively new concept, and only really emerged in roughly the last decade. Obviously intended to give players a consistently fun experience, DDA increases the difficulty according to a variety of formulas based on how the game's AI regards the player's skill level. DDA also started to be applied to other aspects of gameplay, such as rewards and helpful items, where rewards were modified by the difficulty of the encounter, not unlike decisions a Dungeon Master might make in a game of Pen-and-Paper Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Certain items and powerups were sometimes added if the player spent too much time at low health or given a bit of ammo if they were out.\nMax Payne very slightly adjusted the level of aim assistance you got, and upped enemy health a bit depending on your projected skill level and success. I don't know the specific algorithms, be it your health after fights, ammo usage, or some kind of timer, but for the most part, you never really knew God was giving a little boost.\nHalf-Life 2 also did it, but in an even more subtle and unobtrusive manner. Commentary Mode in Episode 1 and 2 reveals that the game slightly modified the contents of the supply boxes you encountered, depending on Gordon's status at the time you break it. Be at full health when you smash the box, and you were more likely to receive the dinky +5 health vials or random ammo. Be on the verge of death, you might get the nice +20 first-aid kits. Subtle, and almost almost invisible. Bravo, Valve.\" \n\nSource: Destructoid\n\nIt's quite an old essay which originates from 2008,  I asked myself, how much the videogame industry advanced in this regard and the result is rather poorly. But don't misunderstand I'm quite relieved about that.\n\nThere's a thin line between, too hard, to easy and just right.\nBecause every player is different, as mentioned in the article, developers tend to calculate the difficulty for the player via an algorith or an AI which changes its behaviour.\n\nThere are 2 issues I see with that concept:\n\n1. You shouldn't know any about this while playing. If you notice changes of the game while you're playing, you got immediately the impression the game just keeps lowering the bar for you until you finally beat that given obstacle.\nThe obstacle by itself is not longer fixed, you don't feel like you accomplished anything, because it's just the game which tries to make you believe you beat the boss by becoming better, but in reality everything was getting more and more favorable to you. \nIt doesn't matter how subtle the changes are, as long you know that one simple fact, the magic is gone.\n\n2. Some very skill heavy (singleplayer) videogames try to encourage you about learning the mechanics of the game and apply them in an frantic situation, if the game is getting more and more lenient to your mistakes then at some point the purposes of those obstacles is gone, the aftermath is: you never learn the game, you never get any better and in your current playthrough you never get the chance to beat a boss or a certain challenge in the same fashion as the designer have it intended by default.\n\nI think it's pretty naive to think that an algorithm or some smartass AI should be able to read exactly the skillset of the player and its growth. You can't let another player, play with your save file because it could change the overall difficulty of the game, there are enough situations where such a system could have no information about. Even then, it's an ginormus task where the chance of an pay-off would be rather small.\n\nFor me it's much more satisfiyng to see that I was able to overcome my own boundaries, if I'm not able to overcome a fair challenge, I'm the one who has to adapt, not the game.\n\nHonestly I think dynamic difficulty was always a bad idea and fails to set clear borders, unlike simple difficulty options can. \n\nPerhaps you can enlarge my horizon.\n\n",

        "text": "Preface: By \"Side Activity\" I particularly mean systems like Gwent in the Witcher 3 and base building in Fallout 4. I've found personally these can greatly help my motivation for progression in open-world games; I was thinking about it recently and wanted to discuss.\n\nTo start out, I must say that I'm someone who's prone to spending a good chunk of time on little diversion-style activities in games, i.e. fishing in Zelda games. I find they can provide some respite from the core game play loop that I enjoy.\n\nI am also someone pretty strongly susceptible to open-world fatigue. As I get further in games, I will start to recognize the patterns in the game-play loop and it'll start to feel repetitive and tedious. Frequently, I begin games as a bit of a completionist but by the end just have to push myself to finish the main story for the sake of experiencing it.\n\nNow, games have many systems to keep you playing to combat this fatigue--including character progression (levels/loot), narrative advancement, and intrinsic game-play enjoyment. \n\nHowever, the one strange system I've found that often helps keep me playing are extra activities such as Gwent in the Witcher 3 and base-building in Fallout 4. These often feel a little tacked-on in terms of the big picture of the game and yet in these particularly cases, I've found they significantly increased my motivation and purpose for exploring new areas.\n\nIn the Witcher 3, a small town with little going on at least means a new shopkeeper to play and a new card to get. In Fallout 4, even the junk loot can be turned into materials to work on a settlement. \n\nAfterwards, the activities themselves provided an extra something to do that breaks up the routine of the core game-play loop. Even if the activities seem unimpressive in a vacuum, I found this aspect and how they loosely tie into game play progression in the other systems (i.e. exploration, loot, etc.) to be oddly compelling.\n\nTo kick-off discussion:\n\n - Does anyone else share my affinity for these \"side activities\"? What do you think makes you enjoy them?\n - Are there any other significant examples in other games you can think of?\n - Should these activities have a more consistent place in open-world games? Can you think of any other activities or games which could benefit from such an activity?",

        "text": "I don't know if games were as formulaic, as they are now. If you played at least few open world games, you know what to expect: Bandit camps, safe houses, merchants, liberating outposts, tons of icons, \"do A and I will give you B\", every game series has it's own formula that it follows, but they all share a lot of commonalities.\n\nOne thing that most role playing games share is predictable decision making system that magically tells you what will happen or it will be so dumbed-down and obvious that it won't even have to tell you what will happen. You pretty much always know what will happen if you will pick A or B answer. Developers wants you to know so you could \"know what decision to make\" and \"role play\" and get the results you want. \n\nSo what does banner saga do differently?  \n\nFirst of all, often you don't know the outcome of your choices. You find some food, people start feeling sick soon after, will you throw it all out? will you keep it all? will you let some of the people eat it and check if it's truly bad?, etc. You don't know the outcome, maybe majority of food is actually good. In the end of the day, it's your decision to make and because of your decision, your caravan might suffer, people might die or maybe your people are starving and that food is crucial, it's your responsibility. \n\nIn banner saga, there is often no \"good\" or \"bad\" choice. Events come up during your journey and your decisions determine the outcome which may as well be completely different from what you expected it to be, because the game is not bending on it's knees to serve you all the choices and outcomes that you would like and expect to get. \n\nThere is always a sense of mystery, sense of realism. It feels like you are in that world, that world that doesn't allow you to cure cancer because your \"medicine skill is 100\", or that world that hooks you like a good book in which you don't know what will happen. \n\nIn the end of the day our games becomes like junk food. You know what you will get, you know what outcomes your decisions will bring. You know which NPC is a \"good guy\" which one will always help you and which one is your villain. It's not that there are no real consequences for your actions, it's that they are always formulaic and designed to be what you expected them to be. \n\nThat's just my thoughts I wanted to share. If anyone has any of their own, please do share if you agree or disagree, or have your own ideas. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So I beat the complete edition on hard mode, gameplay of about 50hrs. I also completed all cauldrons.\n\nI thought the first 3 hours of tutorial were a boring slogfest. It was just exposition and for setting up aloy as some outcast and giving a lot of time into the nora tribe, its quickly forgotten about once she's set out to meridian. Not even rost is brought up again until the end through some npc dialogue and even then, his story is entirely self contained. I think it would've been better if he knew the secrets of the old people and kept aloy cause he knew she was the key to restore gaia. Cliche but at least it ties nicely. \n\nI also never really felt any connection to any of the characters, except sylens cause he's the only one who seems to wonder what the hell happened with the past people and has sly intentions about it. The rest of them all have brick personalities, and aloy is a rather generic protagonist imo. Overall I thought the story did a good job at holding out answers to make it intriguing, but it was rather generic. \n\nInventory management is also a joke. Early levels I worried a bit about ridge-wood, but once you get the scavenger perk (the perk trees are also uselss, there's no sense of making a dedicated build) you never have to worry about low ammo again. Also hunting animals for potions is a chore. \n\nThe platforming is also rather poor imo, you just mindlessley jump along ridges and rocks. Only decent puzzle was in frozen wilds with twisting the gears to guide connect the light beams. This, combined with the open world/traveling, made me frustrated on how much time was wasted running about. A lot of things felt like chores. \n\nThe game really stands out in the machines. I never bother with the human bandit camps, you can get that experience in just about any open world game, and they're extremely boring in this one. Wtih the machines, they fight in different ways that targeting different components/weak points can disable their abilities/attacks to make satisfying and rewarding gameplay. Nailing a shock arrow shot to a ravager, or blowing up the chest of a longlens really makes a nice big explosion for crowd control.\n\nSome enemies have stupid hitboxes or tracking like behemoths and stormbirds, but they're still fun to fight against. A lot of machines are also redundant or outclassed by something similar to them. We don't need chargers and striders, or grazers and lancehorns. Pick one or the other. Also the sawtooth is completley outclassed by the ravager, which is completley outclassed by the scorcher. \n\nI have to say though that the frozen wilds dlc is better in every way than the base game. The main dlc missions had a good blend of machines to fight against like in the cauldron with the behemoth and scorchers, that was fun. Top that off with the fireclaw end boss. The fireclaw is the only real challenge I think for the game, it makes other boss machines a walk in the park. \n\nSo overall it was good, but not as great as everyone makes it out to be. ",

        "text": "I've played japanese fighting games pretty much exclusively, and my only exposure to sports combat games is a couple of sessions of Fight Night 3 at a friend's house.\n\n\nAs someone interested in martial arts, it was interesting to see a more realistic approach to the game mechanics.  However, as far as I can tell, the genre is too wedded to \"real\" licensed athletes, and character statistics based on their career stats etc.\n\n\nIt doesn't feel like it would encourage a carefully designed, balanced and diverse roster that you might see in a proper competitive fighting game.  Not to mention all the training and microtransaction stuff in more recent days.  It feels like a proper competitively balanced combat sports game shouldn't use real athletes, instead using a fictional roster.\n\n\nI've never heard of any fighting game tournaments with any interest in sports combat games, and a quick google doesnt seem to turn up much esports stuff in their own genre.\n\n\nCan people explain why there hasn't been much of an push towards a good, balanced esport viable game based Boxing, MMA or other combat sports?",

My question is, why aren't there more and how hard is it to create one for the casual gamer?  I am talking Midwest, I moved from the East coast so I am aware the coasts have far more options.  \n\nI think they will become more popular as times goes on (they are already growing exponentially), but I know of at least two people ranked in the top 200 of their favorite shooters and they have never participated in any tournaments mainly because they aren't aware of any nearby them.\n\nThe city I live in is one of about 300k people, with one approaching a million 45 minutes away and neither have any scheduled events coming up.  So how hard is it to set up?  I realize if you wanted to start a business focused on gaming or host a tournament you would need to purchase a multitude of consoles and PCs, have substantial internet, and more, or have people loan them.  Since gaming is becoming more socially acceptable by the \"professional\" world and it is becoming more popular, I think now would be the time to intelligently invest in the process.   \n",

While the number of people who play video games are increasing, I'm noticing that there are still a lot of people who, when thinking about platforms for telling stories, usually push video games off out of that subject. In fact, it tends to be a joke even on the Internet that \"nobody plays games for the story.\" But in my personal opinion, I actually believe that video games are not only a great platform for storytelling, but that it is the most effective one we have at telling rich, engaging stories.\n\nI chose to make a video about this discussing in detail why it is that I feel the way I do, which you can watch here if you so choose (it's a little long, but watching this should give you a good idea of where I'm coming from)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdJPFkD8NgU\n\nHowever, I thought this would be really interesting to discuss and get some feedback on. Do you think video games should be considered a serious platform for storytelling along with books, movies, and shows? If so, why do you think it is that the majority of people out there tend to dissociate games from storytelling?",

        "text": "Whilst reading a review for Farcry 5, a concept for a game occurred to me.\n\n---------------------\n\nThe game starts with the main character, a normal looking man, on the phone to what seems to be some sort of cult.  \n\n\"Let me speak to my daughter!  I just... I need to know if she's alright!\"  \n\n\"She doesn't want to speak to you.  Don't call again.\"\n\n\"I have a court order that... \"\n\n\"You should know how much that means to us...\" *hangs up*.\n\n\nSo it turns out that these cultists are trying to secede from the country, and the main character's six year old daughter is in there with them.  They are armed and passionate about defending their \"homeland.\"\n\n\nThe army is gathering and will launch an attack once the politicians get their act together.  A sympathetic army commander turns a blind eye and lets you into the combat zone to get your daughter before any serious shooting starts.\n\n\nLike a typical FPS, you grab a lot of guns, go in shooting, kill many cultists, and eventually find your daughter.  The game is linear and has no choices.\n\n\nThen the ending of the game plays showing father and daughter reunited, and it turns out that the MC is an abusive father who's only after his daughter because his dead wife's rich parents recently died and left her a massive inheritance.  The cultists, whilst they have an crazy goal of seceding from the nation, are otherwise normal and peaceful folk when left alone.  They promised to protect her from the MC.  His daughter ran away to be with her aunt, who is a cultist, and one of your victims along the way.\n\n---------------------\n\nIn other mediums like film and novels, we see unreliable narrators and antiheros sometimes, and it's usually fine.  But in a videogame, where the player is acting out the actions of the main character, is it an unforgivable betrayal if the game lies to the player about the nature of the character they're controlling, and forces the player to do things that later on turn out to be awful and wrong?\n\n----------------------\n\nThe question reminded me a little bit about Silent Hill 2.  But the difference is, although the MC in SH2 has done something awful in the past, all of his actions in the game roughly align with what the player might want (ie. to overcome obstacles and find out the truth.)",

        "text": "I recently finished playing Nier: Automata. For those who don't know, after finishing the third \"Route\" of the story, a shop unlocks where you can buy any unearned trophies with in-game currency. The prices are still fairly steep (50k for bronze, 100k for silver, 200k for gold), although once a trophy pops, you could reload your save, get the money back and buy the next one. \n\nI'm not really sure if Yoko Taro included this as a commentary on trophy chasing being an inherently meaningless pursuit...which would fit the overall theme of nihilism in this game. More likely it was included for players who may choose to have their save data deleted (which is an option during the true ending), and wouldn't have a chance to come back and finish trophy hunting.\n\nIn either case, I found it to be a very interesting choice, and not one that I've seen done in a game before now (although maybe there are other examples of this). Even more interesting were the divisive opinions among fans and players; some calling it a cheap cheat, others saying it doesn't matter what anyone else does with their own game. \n\nI suppose which side of the fence you land on depends on how you see trophies in general:\n\n* If you only hunt trophies for the personal accomplishment because *you're* a completionist, then does it matter how other people around the world choose to play the game, or how they earn the same trophies?\n\n* If you trophy hunt as a competition, comparing scores/ranks with other players, then it's understandable that you may feel slighted by other people not earning those same trophies the \"right\" way. Although, if it's an in-game mechanic allowing you to buy them, who's to say that it's \"wrong\"?\n\nFull disclosure, I did end up using the shop in Nier: Automata to finish up a couple trophies that otherwise would have taken several more hours to earn. Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing this in other games. I love a nice 100% and Platinum as much as the next guy, and if I really enjoy the game I'll put in extra time to complete as many trophies as I can. But there's often one or two extremely tedious tasks involved, and as I get older I don't have the time or inclination to spend hours on those. \n\nOf course, some will argue that if you don't or can't put in the time/effort, then you don't deserve a platinum. Which is a completely fair argument...but again, what impact does it have on you if another player chooses to go that route?",

        "text": "Recently, in the Overwatch community, Jeff Kaplan (the Game Director) debunked a common practice in the game by revealing that leaving a match immediately upon seeing the 'Victory/Defeat' words at the end of a match does not in fact let you queue into a new match quicker than if you were to simply stay in that match and wait for the next one to begin. Actually, the game doesn't let you enter into the matchmaking queue until your previous match resolves completely, and most people think they are speeding things up by skipping the post-match stats, top four cards, and Play of the Game. Much to my surprise, the Overwatch subreddit was filled with highly upvoted people claiming that they really don't care about the post-match stats anyway, apparently they leave quickly because they just want to keep playing, they don't want or care to see all the high scores and POTG. \"Just let me play!\" is what they shout, echoing the age-old \"is it enjoyable\" question that permeates all entertainment, often pitting critics against audiences.\n\nSo, that got me thinking introspectively. I don't understand this mindset fully. Who *doesn't* enjoy winning? It's natural for humans to enjoy seeing their name up in lights. At this point, we're digging into the bedrock of why we even bother playing video games in the first place, the very nature of the hobby itself, the \"goal\" if you will. Certain games in recent times have challenged traditional game design, like the brilliant 'The Stanley Parable' for PC, but even in that game you inevitably finish an aspect of the game. Perhaps I am more competitive than I give myself credit for! Personally, I love the top four, stats, upvote system, and POTG in Overwatch. It validates the game for me. If I make the top four, get lots of medals, or POTG, I feel like I've done something. Surely that's part of the reason they're there. So when people say they don't care about these things, I become skeptical, I wonder if maybe they just lack the attention span to stick around for these relatively brief highlights.\n\nIn-game stats aren't everything to me though, I'll concede. There are very few games that I've sincerely felt the desire to complete 100%, stats wise, or be the best in. In Overwatch, I typically rank in Gold/Platinum tier and I'm satisfied with that, mostly; I don't want an \"alt\" account so I won't \"ruin my stats\" like so many do. I have never felt compelled in a single-player title to collect literally everything for the \"100% completed\" stat, like in a Ubisoft title. If there's a codex in a game, I will collect only what I stumble upon naturally, I won't go for the whole thing unless I'm very invested in the game world\n\nIf I go for broke and do **everything**, it's usually only because there's an incentive, like in a Bioware RPG where there are lots of different choices and outcomes, or character types. If I feel like I'm missing out on something, I have to get it! If I'm not missing out, it's different. Admittedly, that's why I switched to primarily PC gaming, even though I love my consoles; I felt left out when 'BioShock Infinite' was reviewed with a higher score on PC for its superior graphics, and decided I had to see what the fuss was about, and for me it made all the difference in the world.\n\nFor an example, when Terraria first came out (a retro-styled sandbox building Minecraft-esque game), my brother and I played it for dozens of hours, day after day. It was a blast until we got to what was the hardest boss and dungeon, at the time. When we beat that boss...well, I began losing interest. I felt as though I'd \"completed\" the game in a sense. I stopped playing after that, even while they kept updating it. My brother, on the other hand, never fell out of love with it, but then again I've known him to be obsessed with building-type games. The same thing happened for me with Minecraft, coincidentally. Once we reached The Nether, my interest dropped like a stock market crash, I felt as though I'd essentially conquered the game, save for its Ender Dragon.\n\nSo, I digress, my question is this: how much do you personally care about in-game stats and progress? I've met very few people who legitimately did not care about winning or losing, and frankly I don't know if I buy the whole \"It's all about fun\" philosophy that people like to use. I mean, it is all about having fun, but in a competitive game I find it hard to believe that the \"majority of people\" as they claim really don't care about both the metaphorical and literal \"post-game stuff\". Then there are people who say that completing a game 100% is what they're all about. I understand this and I say if that's how you have fun, then go for it, I just don't share it. How about you?\n\nEDIT: It would be nice if we could honor the Rule's suggestion of not downvoting because you disagree. I would appreciate having at least one gaming sub that isn't straight cancer in my veins where people can have a mature discussion. At least post a respectfully disagreeing comment, don't just be all passive-aggressive and downvote things into obscurity.",

        "text": "Currently I'm playing Ni no Kuni II and The Alliance Alive, both of them are JRPG's but in it's structure, gameplay and battle system, they are very different, regardless they both have on big negative in common.\nBoth of them have complex battle system, which you never are forced to learn or even apply.\n\nAs far as I could play (30 hours in the game) I never had to use an of the special systems which the game offers. \nAt first I thought: \"well, the game will surely begin easy and give players the time to adapt and after a certain while, the difficulty will ramp up, because most games have da difficulty curve right?\" Sadly that wasn't the case. I haven't sensed any rising difficulty edge while playing the main game. \n\nThe game looks beautiful and the character design is superb, but the gameplay gets boring after a while, so far that I only want to see what beautfiful scenerys I see next, I'm not longer interested in the gameplay because it's more than trivial.\nI just slash on the enemies without any second thought, even those who are 20 level over my characters were pretty handful in combat. I'm feeling treated like a braindead child, with no alternative to switch to a higher difficulty.\n\nI don't have a problem with easy games, but in JRPG's where the combat is much more undynamically and where tactics are in foreground over mechanical execution,  a certain level of tactics must be provided, otherwise it turns into \"Press A to win\" you are mostly an observer which decisions don't matter. You could switch on auto-battle and the characters would win the fight nevertheless. \nAre there really people who enjoy this? Then why bother with such complex system which offer a level of extra strategy when you don't need them?\n\nThat's also my problem with The Alliance Alive, which has very poor enemy variety, where you fight in almost every dungeon the same enemies like on every corner of the world map. \nMost of them come alone, yes only a single or a maximum of two enemys per encounter, where the they don't get stronger for longer time... such a bummer.\n\nWell unlike Ni no Kuni II this game can have it's challenging moments, but you have to seek them by searching for difficult special encounters on the world map, where there are very few and I believe most of them were suited to a higher level party, because the main story is pretty much a nobrainer with trivial fights.\n\nThose two games are the most recent examples, but I've encountered much more modern JRPG's in this regard where I had high hopes on because, they seem to do a lot of things great and are very beatiful to look on\n\nAnd yes I know, some of you will probably downvote me because I will mention some famous titles, but none of them force you to use its tactical depth unless you are super underleveled.\n\n- Dragon Quest VII Remake (\"Press A to Win\", when you get your classes you are even more powerful, almost every later boss dies in 7 to 8 hits, that's far away from the spirit of the dragon quest series)\n- The Longest 5 Minutes (This game is even worse, I even don't know where to start...)\n- The Pokemon Series (Most people will know the problems, the game does have it's challenging encounters but you can only find them in the post-game, the games seem to get easier after every new entry)\n- Fire Emblem Awakening (Haven't played the sequels, but this game was pretty bad considered, you could stomp every opposing unit in the game, just with you tactician and its high dodge value. Besides there are many other overpowered units, I did quit the game halfway because it had little to no variety and the battles were boringly easy)\n- Final Fantasy 15 (Not turn based, but it's pretty much impossible to die, phoenix feathers are overpowered because they can revive you right after you died and there is no item cap.\n- 7th Dragon III (Tactial Combat, but very easy to abuse, later encounters and mini-bosses die with only 1 hit.\n- Nier Automata (I wished this game would have no RPG system because it's just annoying. This game has (unbalanced) difficulty levels, but at the same time you can trivialize the game in any regard. So you have unlimited I-Frames by spamming the dodge button, your allies are invincible and you can use them to destroy the boss enemy for you while you just use ranged attacks from far away. (which most bosses can't counter) You can buy 99 amount of every healing item for on the cheap and can use it while you are in combat from the start menu or even with auto-heal, there are overpowered chips and so on... the battles system is some kind of fun if you don't realise all its flaws, but well I don't want to focus to much on this game, because I don't want to consider it as an J-RPG, more like an Hack'n'Slay with (unnecessary) RPG elements\n\nPositive Examples I can think of lately are the Etrian Odyssey Series, Kindgom Hearts 0.2 and The Shin Megami Tensei Series (including Persona) \n\nI'm really disappointed with that fact, because in the past, the battlesystems of JRPG's weren't that much complex, but at least they did have it's difficulty where you have to think for an efficient strategy. Even Final Fantasy X which is no difficult game, have it's difficulty-curve and unique bosses where you have to develop a certain approach. That's something which I see more and more rarely. \nEven Dragon Warrior 1 which is considered as the first JRPG ever has its ressource-management, which is something I only see nowadays in games like Persona 5 and The Etrian Odyssey series.\nI'm pretty sure Dragon Quest 11 will become a easy brainfart as well, where you just battle without any second thought countless boring encounters, with no ressource management, which is the complete opposite from the dragon quest games in the past.\n\nSo yeah well, I get gloomy if I think to much about this stuff but it really annoys me, I just can't have fun because all those games play themself regardless how promising they look...\n",

Well, you got the idea, right? \n\nThere is two overused protagonist archetypes in games, and i think that two latest Tales games are great for demonstrating it - in Zestiria we have nice and cheerfull (but not cute or adorable) Sorey, and in Berseria - glum and violent Velvet. And that's two type of characters that usually end up the main ones in many, many games, while those like Edna or Magilou usually being either partners, or npc's. \n\nOnly games that i can remember fast enough is Deadpoll (he is funny, but not adorable) and Resident Evil 0 (Rebecca is adorable, but not funny). Also maybe Lollipop Chainsaw have both of these combined - can't say for sure because i didn't played the game, but it looks like it. But i can't remember any other games with characters like i described (i am sure that i forgot a few, but still there is too little of them). Even fighting games who don't have \"main\" characters still feature \"strong\" ones as a \"face\" of the game, for example - Chun Li from Street Fighter, when those like Elena not even appearing in all games of the series. The question is - why? \n\nI was thinking that maybe it's hard to write a story about someone who makes  you smile all the time - but as a writer, i don't see any major problems with it personally. Maybe publishers not allowing for someone unusual to become main character? Then they would appear in indie games, but they are not. Then what's wrong? ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/883uja/how_to_avoid_resource_gathering_grind_in_survival/",
        "text": "I made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmqGsWsuXlw&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLCZleGQiTyuB39Ui58e2knVynrEVAkyTN&amp;t=0s) that discusses the resource gathering and base building in modern survival crafting games. I discuss why having purpose and challenge is important for any crafting games and why many games including the biggest titles in a genre get gathering resources wrong. Below there is transcript so **there is absolutely no need to watch anything** if you don't want in order to participate in discussion. \n\nTranscript\n-----------\n\nGrind, grind never changes. It started with Minecraft and it’s mine design, poor people spend hours if not day s staring at the cubical rocks, other games followed with 2D rocks of Terraria or voxels Space Engineers.\n\nDevelopers often confuse things that are time consuming with things that are challenging. It’s not a problem unique to survival and crafting games idea of grind is well know to any World of Warcraft or Diablo player. Let’s be honest wasting players time is not fun. \n\nBut Grind, grind never changes… or does it?\n\nSome developers will argue that there are players who enjoy the grind because so many players choose to do this. This is ultimately false. Player will always choose optimal strategy even if this is the most boring strategy available in the game. Good developers make games where the most optimal strategy is also a fun one. \n\nWe players need to have a sense of accomplishment and that what we do matters.\n\nFortnite from all things has one of the best resource gathering mechanics I have seen I am going to analyse why it feels so good. Apart of mindlessly basing with a picaxe player can chase ever moving weak spot for extra damage more resources and faster mining. With this simple game developers added a challenge to otherwise brain dead mechanic. Listen to how satisfying it sounds to destroy the the car in this game. \n\nIn fortnite you work with a team and are constrained for time this two factors make gathering resources fast important for your overall success, not only that game rewards you badges for your ability to scavenge environment that then in turn give you better schematics and further help in the game. Every feedback fortnite gives you is reinforcing idea that smashing cars with oversized picaxe is lots of fun let's be honest it is and that’s why this is usually the first thing players do the moment they spawn on the map. \n\nThis takes us to other important point in the discussion players don’t want to go mining or tree chopping they want to go on the thrilling expedition and have their skills put to the test. In most games you find resources on the map sit down and suck the patch dry for all it has in relative safety. Not the case in fortnite yes some places are better than others but really good stuff comes with challenge players can even voluntarily increase their mission difficulty to end up with better rewards. \n\nIn fortnite you have usually about 15 min to complete the mission. You must make quick strategic decision do I go after steel to make a base safer and help my team succeed should I chasse additional objectives for extra reword at a cost of potential failure for the team or should I scavenge through crates and look for trap and weapon components to make defense easier that way. Each player will go with what their priorities are at the moment.  \n\nNot only that but you also try to save some resources to take home with you to protect your homebase so now building comes with decisions and compromises. \n\nTo recap players want challenge, danger and meaningful decision making process to feel that they are in control.\n\nLet’s quickly look at few other games that do this feedback loop just right from survival and crafting genre. \n\nEarly Project zomboid all the way up to mid game. Each expedition is potential death sentence. Players really know that when their leave protected base. Do you scavenge nearby buildings so you can return home easily multiple times but risk activating alarm and bringing zombie horde straight to your front yard or do you venture further afield and try but risk being cut off from your home base? \nThis Long Dark is another great game that pushes players to risk a lot. Leaving a relative safety of the house is necessary in order to survive. Player will need to leave in order to find food, water and warmth and each trip comes with high risk reward cost. It never feels like a chore because every time it’s a new expedition. Even retrieving some rabbits you cough in a trap can result in meeting eye to eye with hungry wolf attracted by its prey. \n\nMore game developers need to put gameplay before realism and focus on creating fun challenging experiences.\n\nI would like to hear your opinions on games that game resource gathering just right and how it can be improved from standard punch tree for 30 sec to get some wood.

I beat the dark souls trilogy and after play other genres for a while I felt like playing something similar to dark souls and that was when I came to Nioh.\n\nFor many Nioh is basically dark souls with samurais and I found it to be true, but the main difference lies in the type of difficult each game uses.** Imao I think dark souls has the ‘right’ difficult** because the difficult comes from the level design: \n\n* The layout of the area\n* The area itself (environment damage, holes you can fall in...)\n* The position of enemies\n* Enemies attack patterns\n* Some bullshit moments\n* And so on\n\nWhile Nioh difficulty lies in get one shotted and multiple enemies fights. Once I finished the game in NG++ I went to \\Nioh to discuss what I thought about the difficult, that for me was obviously artificial, but for my surprise a lot of people there think the opposite: Nioh is a ‘true’ hard game while dark souls has the artificial difficult.\n\nI found this to be curious and after see such different points of view I would like to hear what more people think about the subject.

We thought people here might be interested in a partnership we put together with an indie games developer that we're really proud of.\n\nCJFE has partnered with publisher Surprise Attack Games to send 443 license keys for the video game Orwell: Ignorance is Strength to Members of Canada's Parliament and Senate. We are doing this as part of an educational initiative to familiarize Canada’s lawmakers with the ethical implications of new espionage powers that would be created for Canada’s spies following the passage of Bill C-59, An Act respecting national security matters. CJFE is concerned that many of the same fictional powers on display in Orwell: Ignorance is Strength are being made available to Canada’s very real cyber spies through Bill C-59, a deeply troubling update to the widely opposed Anti-Terrorism Act, 2015 (Formerly, Bill C-51).\n\nThe plot of Orwell: Ignorance is Strength puts the player in the role of a digital spy charged with collecting open and closed source information about residents of a country known only as ‘The Nation’. Information is collected in order to tick off goals in a sweeping national security investigation. As information is revealed, the player becomes the arbiter of truth, with the option of allowing lies and fake news to spread unchecked while monitoring their uptake and spread on social media. The impression Orwell: Ignorance is Strength gives is the overwhelming omniscience of the 21st century digital spy. It thematically reinforces many of our most pressing concerns with Bill C-59.\n\nChief among these concerns is the establishment of an offensive cyberwarfare mandate for the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), which would allow the CSE to “degrade, disrupt, influence, respond to or interfere with the capabilities” of non-Canadian entities. An aggressive reading of this statute could permit the CSE to, for example, “disrupt” access to the website of a foreign news organization, “influence” a foreign news organization by forging or altering documents relied upon by its journalists, or “interfere with” key technologies such as encryption tools and anonymity software that journalists and others routinely use in their work. All of these scenarios pose unacceptable risks to journalists and the free press.\n\nWe are also concerned that foreign communications monitoring activities of the CSE could incidentally or intentionally result in the collection, use, and analysis of the communications of Canadian journalists with overseas sources. Considering the breadth of information available online, in combination with the CSE’s powers to collect information from foreign allies by entering into arrangements, and from other branches of government, the CSE could potentially build comprehensive digital dossiers on Canadians without ever running afoul of Bill C-59’s prohibition on directly targeting Canadians.\n\nAs a political statement and an educational product, Orwell, like the eponymous author, gives us a glance into the grim dystopia of total information awareness. Many of the same powers in the game are proposed for Canada’s digital spies in Bill C-59. This partnership is an excellent opportunity to educate parliamentarians about what exactly is at risk in the current wording of this bill.\n\nCheck out this link if you want to learn more.

The writing is good, the universe is complex and interesting, and the game is fun and very re-playable. And fans make their own campaigns that rival or outclass the games themselves. Case in point: The CalFree series. \n\n\nThis all takes place in CalFree, which is part of future magical California. As I said, this universe is complicated and involves cyborgs and dragons. It's best just to jump in, be confused for a while, and not try to understand it all immediately.\n\n\nShadowrun Dragonfall expansion campaign:\n\nAntumbra Saga\n\n\nShadowrun Hong Kong expansion campaigns:\n\nCaldcott Caper\n\nCalFree in Chains\n\n\nThey basically follow the stories of different groups vying for control of future magical California. Xenophobic elves, Imperial Japanese, megacorps, etc. And your character is somehow becomes involved in the schemes of the groups trying to control CalFree. \n\n\nI've been playing them backwards but... Holy shit, guys. These are really good. The creator uses the game mechanics themselves to help tell the story in ways that the original campaigns don't. I would liken it to Bioshock: Infinite where a large part of the reason I cared about Elizabeth was because the combat was far more fun with her than without her. When she wasn't around, I wanted  to rush thru and get my multiverse witch back, so my normally conservative save-every-potion-and-grenade playstyle became one of urgent rampage. One aspect of this is in Shadowrun is that, unlike in the normal campaigns, in these expansions you can actually anger your team to the point where they abandon you. Imagine playing Mass Effect and Mordin just gets sick of your shit and leaves. Yeah. You're going to start paying closer attention to those dialog options now, aren't ya? This is just one example of how the creator has played with the game mechanics to tell his story. \n\n\nNote: I still haven't made it very far in the first of the series and probably won't. The latter two are significantly better (no judgement, everything get's easier the 2nd or 3rd time you do it) and Shadowrun:Hong Kong is also a better basis than Shadowrun: Dragonfall. Both are great games but it's hard to go backwards. It would be like trying to play the original Assassin's Creed again. It's fun but you'll miss all the cool mechanics that came about in future iterations. ",

As people started calling me ‘rookie’ or ‘rook’ and my character said nothing in return, I couldn’t help but compare this model to what was used in Witcher. I prefer the Witcher model. \n\nControlling a Geralt of Rivia or a Snake or a Shepherd or a Nathan Drake is, in my opinion, so much better. I am always much more vested in those characters then, say, my Skyrim character where it is left to me to create him, largely in my mind. \n\nI think the concept is that putting a mute character in surrounded by other characters that walk up and perform soliloquies to you and then walk away is somehow more immersive. It isn’t that way for me. By the end of Far Cry 5, my guess is that my character will have developed just as much as my PUBG avatar, maybe with some more clothes, who knows. \n\nAny thoughts on this, or is this a well worn topic here?",

        "text": "So quite recently I've been playing the Division after snatching it off a sale, and a lot of my time was spent on side missions (basically errands).\n\nDuring these missions, I noticed something strange. Now the discussion on objective markers and \"following a dotted line\" thing has been gone over quite a few times, and I think it's quite agreed upon that these pathfinding features take away elements of exploration. However, in some of these side missions, in which I have to leave the open streets and go indoors, I find myself very lost, and surprisingly enough, longing for the same kind of \"dotted line\" that was supposed to be harmful to the experience.\n\nFor context, in The Division there are markers for missions, as well as a path if you select something on the map, though the latter do not appear indoors. Even though most of these rooms are a linear path from A to B (with some dead ends), I constantly struggle with finding a way through them, bumbling about like a headless fly until one of the doors lead to where I want, which feels really awful.\n\nMy personal take on this is that the indoor environments are poorly designed in that the pathway isn't readily apparent. The doors you need to take are not obvious, and are usually either hidden from plain sight, within darkness, makes little sense as a path, or all of the above. A potential remedy may be to highlight the intended direction to take with the environment itself, like light and painted arrows.\n\nI'd love to hear people's opinion on what other games have this issue or deal with them well, and anything else related.

        "text": "Dear r/truegaming,\n\nMy name is Theo Toresson and I am a student of Science in Psychology at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden - currently writing my master’s thesis. The survey aims to gain understanding of the different aspects of gaming that affects psychological well-being. The moderators of your subreddit have been kind enough to let me post this in your sub. The survey will take about 10 minutes to complete. I hope that as many of you as possible want to help me by doing this survey, because in order to make something out of this I hope to get data from a broad variety of gamers.  Also, you should feel free to post this survey anywhere there might be gamers - to friends or on forums, twitch, twitter facebook etc. So if you have a few minutes to spare in between games, use it for this survey - it's for (actual) science. Thank you for your time!\n\n**LINK TO SURVEY:** https://samgu.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2rvhBqqSVrTycC1\n\nAll the best,\nTheo Toresson,\nMaster of Science in Psychology at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\n**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\n**FAQ:**\n\nI have received a few questions and comments on the survey. I can’t change anything in the survey due to the fact that it would corrupt the data. Please refer to the FAQ below should any confusion occur during or after the survey.\n\n**I live in Ireland, Northern Ireland, Hong Kong, Faroe Islands or United Kingdom – where is my country?**\n\nThe list is lacking a few countries. You can choose any country on the list as long as you make sure to specify the correct country in the very last question of the survey. If you live in England, Scotland or Wales, please select Great Britain.\n\n**What kind of device is Nintendo Switch? And what if I play my most played game on both console and computer?**\n\nChoose the way you play the game the most. Switch can count as either portable device or console, answer according to your most frequent type of usage.\n\n**You ask for streaming, but what about Youtube and other sites for non-streaming video content related to gaming?**\n\nUse the “other”-alternative on the question about gaming related activities and fill in your preferred alternative in the corresponding box. For the content to count as “streaming” in the other questions of the survey however it has to be live (e.g. live on Twitch, Mixer or Youtube *LIVE*).\n\n**Some genres are unrepresented, for example fighting games, what can I do?**\n\nUse the “other”-alternative and fill in your favorite genre in the corresponding box if it’s missing.\n\n**You ask for money spent on games each week, but I only buy one game each month, is my spending 0?**\n\t\nNo. Calculate your weekly expenditure by dividing your monthly by four, for example.\n\n**How can you know that my mental and physical health is related in any way to my gaming?**\n\nI can’t. Your hand injury might be because of an accident you had yesterday. You should still fill in the box, because even if I can’t see the underlying causes of your health (as an individual), I can analyze it on a group level and look for patterns among thousands of replies. If there is no connection between a particular way of gaming and a particular mental or physical state, I won’t find any connection. There is no need to worry that you’re messing up the data! So try to be as honest as possible in the survey, even if you know that your state is not related to your gaming.\n\n**The questions in the end seem focused on the negative side of gaming. What is your motive?**\n\nI am a gamer myself, and have been for all my life. I have had several amazing experiences with games, and also a few bad ones. Gaming has many positive effects, there is research to support that. For a minority of people, gaming can have negative effects (just like alcohol, work, sex, candy, exercise, therapy, TV, horseback riding or really anything that can be enjoyable). This particular study is done to explore correlations (not causality) between different kinds of gaming, social and mental health problems (I myself work as a therapist, therefore my focus). Neither I (the author) nor the institution is biased towards gaming in general in an either positive or negative way.\n\n**Will I get to see the results?**\n\nYes. The thesis will be in Swedish, but I will post a summary of the results in all subreddits that have been participating in the study, most likely sometime in June 2018.\n\n**What is your favorite game?**\n\nNo one has actually asked me this, but for the record it’s Super Smash Bros. Melee!\n\n**I have more questions!**\n\nFeel free to send an email to gustoreth@student.gu.se and I will get back to you as soon as possible.\n",

        "text": "After finally grabbing all the moons in Super Mario Odyssey, I realized that a large number of the power moons I had collected in the dozens of hours I've been playing were mostly just giveaway moons. To start, Super Mario Odyssey is an extremely well-designed games, filled with many of my favorite kingdoms in the whole series, but at a certain point, I started to get that tedious feeling of the game becoming a collect-a-thon. While I know this is what Mario technically is, the game was no longer as fun as those moments where you enter Kingdoms for the first few times.\n\nUntil then, I just felt like this stemmed into a more common issue with how open world games are designed. Even though The Witcher 3 and Metal Gear Solid V were my favorite games of 2015, I think some aspects in their design falll under this issue. They're both still amazing open world games, definitely one of the best, but in my opinion, they feel somewhat \"bloated\".\n\nIn Super Mario Odyssey, the quarter of my playtime were used on remaining moons after those post-game challenges. That quarter unfortunately began to feel like padding, something I never would have expected from a *Mario* game. I felt like it never reached that transcendent level i.e. original Super Mario Galaxy, just because it really became repetitive. It was just too much, even for completionists. Nintendo was smart letting gamers finish with a third of the moons, because they seem to think that padding really needed to fill up all that open space for the kingdoms.\n\nMeanwhile, in The Witcher 3, the quests, particularly the optional ones, are very well-written but some aspects started to grate on me. The investigation mechanism brings down the experience to a halt, for sure. Especially since Witcher sense, is basically a system which involves no player involvement regarding the gameplay aspect. It's an incredibly tiring formula which ultimately constitutes most of the content of both the main and side stories. This was even worse in the main quests, where most of it all boiled down to cutscene --&gt; detective vision --&gt; kill monster --&gt; go back to NPC. It didn't help that the combat and the mechanics were pretty meh on the whole, and even though they had visual variety, fighting different enemy types had no substantial difference. Looking back, I could have searched for which quests were worthwhile since I agree for a fact that most of my favorite side quests in RPGs could be found in this game. It's just a damn shame that I had to stumble through some *okay* ones along with it. Writing this, the writing and character development is what made The Witcher 3 stand out, for sure.\n\nAnother game I mentioned is Metal Gear Solid V. Probably the best stealth game ever made, by a distance. Yes, it might not be finished. Yes, it's light on story. No, it's not the **worst** Metal Gear game. It's in the top 3, definitely. The problem is that, with the original content's length, why was adding that many side ops, though still enjoyable with the game's mechanics, seen as necessary? The enemy outposts had great level design, but why add the long distances of nothing, with the occasional enemy convoy? Why did they decide to add a lot of gameplay content but without the story context that usually comes with it? Metal Gear Solid 4 received backlash for too many cutscenes, but this one just steered in the opposite direction way too much. The main draw of the open world is tactical freedom of approach, yet exploration has essentially no purpose in the *open world*. To make things worse, side ops exist basically just for grinding materials and *maybe* try out new playstyles.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling at this point, what do you guys think of how these games handled the open world and when do you consider open world games too bloated?",

        "text": "Like many, I'm currently playing Far Cry 5. I like it. It's a good game.\n\n\nHowever, I think that the towers from previous games served a purpose beyond just gating progress; the removal of these towers, combined with the amped-up version of the typical 'Far Cry chaos' in Far Cry 5, is making the game less enjoyable for me.\n\n\nI want to stress just how busy Far Cry 5 is. in every sense of the word. There is no time nor room to breathe. If you stand for 30 seconds to admire a mountain or a bird or a distant fire, you can almost guarantee that there will be a truck hurtling down the road towards you when you turn around. I am now completely numb to distant gunfire because it is so constant. I can't walk past a town without UI pop ups telling me about new characters, quests, challenges, vehicles weapons, companions - it's exhausting. \n\n\nA lot of this comes from how new activities are discovered in Far Cry 5. In pursuit of, I guess, immersion, discovery of activities is ambient. If you walk past a sign for a deer trail, you get a pop up telling you that deers have been added to your map. If you overhear someone talking about a silo full of explosives, it's marked on your map. But Far Cry 5 is so packed with these activities that the pop and swoosh of notifications feels relentless.\n\n\nAnd just as I've digested the notifications and additions to my map, a helicopter swoops overhead, a truck full of prisoners skates past and they're all firing at me. Again, there is no room to breathe. Sometimes I just want to wander quietly through a forest that I've never seen before and enjoy the view.\n\n\nWhich brings me to the towers. They were trite and arbitrary but served more of a purpose than simply gating progress. They provided organisation in games that would otherwise, as in Far Cry 5, be too chaotic for their own good. If I was feeling overwhelmed at the number of routes forward in Far Cry 3, I could stop climbing towers and start ticking things off my list. When I was ready to see more options, I could climb a tower and add them to my list. I was in control.\n\n\nIn Far Cry 5, the absence of towers means that, on my way to do activity A, activity X, Y and Z pop off. Perhaps I'm old but it is draining in a way that I've not really experienced before.\n\n\nIn a game where the minute-to-minute action can feel so chaotic, towers brought a level of control to the metagame (is that the right word?) that is sorely missing from Far Cry 5.",
