        "text": "Not many books describe alien psychology and society well. Most commonly, differences from humans are effectively limited to different appearances, architecture, and technology (this is true for almost every space opera setting). In other cases, authors portray aliens as intrinsically incomprehensible (hello, Lem, Vinge, and others). They mostly rely on the scarceness of information about these alien species and use convoluted language to give a sense of their otherness. But when I think about detailed descriptions of alien civilizations that wouldn't be agnostic, so to say, and wouldn't be a poor copy of a description of some Asian or Indian culture, very few books come to mind. It's even harder if one wants to find a book where everything would finish not with mutual annihilation, but with something resembling an optimistic ending. \n\n\"The Gods Themselves\" by Asimov is pretty brilliant and comes to mind first. Tchaikovsky's \"Children of Time\" is great too. Peter Watts' \"Blindsight\" is cool in terms of portraying alien minds, but he's the biggest pessimist of all. Yudkowsky's \"Three Worlds Collide\" is in many ways the most insightful, concentrated on different possible ethical systems, but also pretty pessimistic. What else can you remember?",

        "text": "As I was more a casual viewer of the show only because my parents were more into that stuff, I remember a lot of earlier episodes more than the later ones ironically the ones with Leonard Nimoy.\n\nThe episode I refer to is the 10th one of the first season called \"The Carriers\". It's a ripped from the headlines kind of thing that I do remember reading about where the USSR (fictional in the show) had set up a few Eastern European camps and built fake American towns and cities to train agents how to infiltrate the US and gather real time intel from every facet of American life. Although I never watched it, I believe the more current show, \"The Americans\" focused partly on this concept post camp-training.\n\nWhat I consider where it \"leaks\" (a pun ) into scifi is that without the trainee's knowledge, they are  infected with a deadly embryonic pathogen/plague put in drinking water which spreads on physical contact. The theory is that once the trainees are sent to the US and the last trainee finally dies along with millions of Americans, so goes all evidence of the source, plan and evidence of the plague.\n\nI found the combination of the 2 tropes fascinating. I also have to say, that Barbara Bain is quite the multi faceted actress.\n\n\"Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to destroy this plague and expose the \"villages\" for what they are. This message will self destruct in 5 seconds\"",

The plot goes as follows:  \n\n\nIt's about a group of young persons, that try to make sense of life. They pay in stores with their emotions, crying thank you at the register. When they die, they stay in limbo for a while and can choose whichever body they want afterwards.  \n\n\nThey are so bored with life, that they crash themselves so they can choose a new body. Sometimes as an golden angel, or a big blue blob with a lot of eyes.  \n\n\nThe protagonist starts female, but chooses the body of a sad male poet a few times. He/she goes off to the desert in the end, to live by himself. His friend, that chooses the weirdest, non human bodies usually, only does it to gain attention to his inner self, who loves the protagonist and wants to be seen as a personality, rather than an attractive body.  \n\n\nDoes this ring any bells with you guys? I hope you can help me!",

This one I didn't really pick up on until my latest rewatch, how she gives him a slight smile as she dies, how he goes from respecting the monsters in the beginning to hating them at the end because they killed Carolyn. \n\n2) I can also see that he did kill her. I always thought he did. How she's says she wouldn't die for him, and that him going back for Imam and Jack cost her life at his hands. I always thought he killed her because of this, that there was a trade off for him going back for the others, as she says she would die for them but not him.\n\nI lean more towards he didn't kill her because it makes the redemption of Riddick more well rounded, how he said he died on the planet, meaning his old killer self. But idk how I never noticed this, I've seen the movie many times. Am I the only one who though he kills her?",

The game system has a whole section for randomly generating worlds, but it's designed for a whole sector, a region of the galaxy of something like 10-30 star systems, and I'm doing things differently, having the whole setting just be on single star system.\n\nI've still used the randomizer somewhat, but I thought I'd also turn to you all. I know there are a lot of typical places you'd expect to see in a sci-fi setting. There's the planet with a city that spans the whole world. There's the seedy fringe world with the shady cantinas. There's the resort world for the insanely wealthy. There's the cyberpunk-style world controlled by megacorporations. There's the mining world populated by disgruntled workers.\n\nThere are also locales one might expect to see, that aren't necessarily worlds. The aforementioned cantina, for instance. Or the track of the illegal, but very famous, jetbike races. Or the multiplanetary corporate headquarters. Or the system-wide famous shipyard where the best ships are built. \n\nOr whatever! What I'm looking for here is ideas of what kinds of places, planets, locations, etc., you might expect to see in a sci-fi setting. They won't all go in, of course, so please suggest as many as you can think of! What are some places you would want to see?",

In this case though, the human element is nearly entirely removed, but the origin would still start as human.

Third Sister shook out her frill in an attempt to dislodge the dust and grime that had collected there. She resisted the urge to lick off a particularly clingy bit of dirt in public and tried to focus on how the rest of the crew was coming along. The flight of Winged was circling the dig site taking readings. They were clearly flagging however. Only half of the flight members were maintaining the suggested elevation and the rest were exposing their teeth in a way that suggested they were about to forfeit their natural herbivore natures to start biting chunks out of the humans. The humans too were beginning to lag. Despite sensibly traveling along the ground they had been moving large ammounts of dirt with nothing but the simple levers and wheels that seemed to make up the base tool set of every network of humans no matter what their stated profession was.\n\n‚ÄúThird Sister?‚Äù Seventeen Trills fluttered over to her side and hovered there, not looking directly at her.\n\nThird Sister was well aware that their sensory horns gave them essentially full circle awareness that was more accurate than simple sight but she still couldn‚Äôt help feeling a prickle of annoyance at apparently being ignored even as he requested her attention. She clicked a response in Mother out of irritation. At least the pesky little Hellbats could hear a reasonable range of sound.\n\n‚ÄúI think it might be time to rest our wings,‚Äù Seventeen Trills observed.\n\n‚ÄúI too have noticed that the extended physical labor has effected flight efficiency,‚Äù she noted. ‚ÄúI agree with your judgment.‚Äù\n\nHe snapped his beady black eyes around at her.\n\n‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs not us I‚Äôm concerned about,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the humans.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhy do you think that?‚Äù Third Sister asked, suddenly genuinely curious.\n\nEver since their first interactions the Winged had integrated the humans into their mythos as paragons of physical strength. She could not count the number of problems that arose medically because some Winged commander believed his humans to be near indestructible, and the humans were oddly loath to dissuade this idea. For a commander as inexperienced as Seventeen Trills to recognize human frailty in any form was something worth noting. However he seemed reluctant to speak. Another oddity that. He finally just gestured for her to follow him with his wing hook and led her around the corner of the structure they were erecting.\n\nShe saw what he was observing immediately. One of the larger humans, a Third Brother, if she remembered correctly was stopped dead in his tracks with the single-wheel mass transporter full of dirt and detritus blocking the main path. His head was tilted to the side and he was staring down at the handles of the device with a fascinated expression on his face. More importantly his skin was flushed with the pulsing of vessels trying to expel the excess mammalian heat of his body. His skin was venting copious amounts of water in an effort to evaporate away the energy.\n\n‚ÄúThird Brother?‚Äù She asked carefully as she approached him. ‚ÄúAre you well?‚Äù\n\nTo her growing concern he didn‚Äôt respond.\n\n‚ÄúRanger!‚Äù Seventeen Trills snapped out. ‚ÄúWhat are you looking at?‚Äù\n\nThe human responded to that by raising his eyes to them, however the twin points didn‚Äôt focus on either of them.\n\n‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it amazing?‚Äù he asked in a hushed tone.\n\n‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt what amazing?‚Äù Third Sister asked.\n\n‚ÄúThe material sciences have advanced,‚Äù the Third Brother said with slow words, ‚Äúbut the basic design of the wheelbarrow has not changed in thousand of years!‚Äù\n\nHis gaze drifted over and past her frill before focusing on what the humans called the middle distance.\n\n‚ÄúThousands!‚Äù he whispered, using only his breath to enunciated the sounds in hushed awe.  ‚ÄúThis is the same thing that our ancestors might have used thousands of years ago.‚Äù\n\nHer frill snapped rigid with concern and Third Sister carefully stepped forward to touch the hot skin of the humans arm. Seventeen Trills fluttered around her giving out little distressed chirps of confusion.\n\n‚ÄúDo you need a nap Third Brother?‚Äù Third Sister asked in the softest tone her voice was capable of producing.\n\nHe slowly swiveled his head to face her and blinked.\n\n‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶‚Äù he said carefully. ‚ÄúI think maybe yes?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSeventeen Trills,‚Äù Third Sister said. ‚ÄúCall an end to the work day and please have the least tired of your wing escort the humans home.‚Äù\n\nThe human in front of them lifted the wheelbarrows handles and began pushing towards the transport before stopping and looking back at them with wonder in his eyes.\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúI mean I never experimented much as a kid you know? Is this what it‚Äôs like to be high?‚Äù\n\nThird Sister stared at him in bewilderment until he smiled and started back up the path.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# [Humans are Weird](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk) [‚ÄãBook Series](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n# [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n# [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n# [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/vnbeyqglyhda1.gif",

They will be suited with composite steel armor that can shave off almost any projectile that an opposing force will throw at it! They will be carrying heavy machine guns and other heavy weaponry that's usually reserved for heavy armored vehicles!
