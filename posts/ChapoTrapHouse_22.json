        "text": "&gt;Yes. Socialism doesn’t work in America and it’s provable by looking up the numbers. Chapo Trap House doesn't want to Google the numbers because their ego and small penises can't take being wrong.\n\n.\n\n&gt;Lol you guys literally can't take it! Go ahead ban me and I'll prove my point further. You are just Liberal fascists who want me to pay for your shit. Not happening! White males rule the world. Get over it. Keep voting in women and diversity and watch your little Liberal communist party fall into shambles.\n\n.\n\n&gt;We are playing on my terms. I'm the rich white male and part of the 1% you despise. Why would a miserable poor socialist dictate the rules to me? I'm a colonizer, a ruler of the world. You bow down to my white privilege bitch. You admit in all your ideologies that I rule over you. Now play the part pussy. ORRRRRRR is it possible that maybe something in what you believe is flawed? Wow logic and reason. Oh wait that stuff is bad. Please bring Virgin Texas so I can destroy him. He's a pussy and won't do it. I know it.\n\n.\n\n&gt;Honestly? Defund the government and decrease everyones taxes down to 10%. People working at Mcdonalds would start making about 2400 a month instead of 1200. End Federal taxes eventually altogether and let everyone make more. Mathematically people producing their own wealth should keep it, its the only way. Redistribution won't work because of too many people and not enough wealth. The people you think you are helping would starve to death as they have in all of human history when it's been tried. What I want to tell you to trigger the fuck out of you? Beat them with dildos and put them in concentration camps.\n\n.\n\n&gt;You people want to help the poor and so do I. You are just misguided on how to do it. What you are advocating for doesn't work. I still have just as much compassion as I did before. You can Google all the numbers and it will blast you with the truth right to your face. I'm telling you. I was just like you. You are searching for the truth which is good, but you aren't there yet. I shouldn't be a dick to you people because your intentions are good. People tried to tell me stuff and I didn't believe it either. You have to get to the point where you are capable of admitting you are wrong. And unfortunately you are BIG TIME wrong about socialism. That's the sign of true intelligence, admitting when you are wrong. Also Mcdonalds workers would be making about 200 dollars a month on socialism. They would starve to death. My plan is better.\n\n.\n\n&gt;I hated Donald Trump MORE than you just two years ago trust me. I despised him. I wanted to put a grenade up his ass. The truth is he’s an eccentric guy who had the right opprtunies and he took advantage of every one of them. Cultural Marxism didn't touch him like it did you and I one bit because he's always been rich and based. Watch a phone call of him doing real estate. He’s decisive, has a vision, and doesn’t play games. Stop watching the TV. CNN is not your friend. Half of CNN went to Yale and were in Skull and Bones which is the CIA breeding ground.\n\n.\n\n&gt;Better start working out 💪 pussy. We aren’t going easily. If we catch you oh boy will it be fun. The reality is for you is that more than likely your own people will torture you and kill you. As much as you see me as the enemy, someone else probably right next to you sees you as the enemy. It could be race, money, gender, thoughts, whatever it is someone sees you as oppressing them. In Mao’s China it was brothers and sisters and even parents who killed one another. Don’t worry, your own friends will torture you and kill you far worse than any of the capitalists you hate.\n\n.\n\n&gt;When I was a socialist the whole point of it was NOT to do it the way they did since they fucked it up so badly. I guess that’s just lost on you people and you are clamoring to eat your pets and children just like they did. Another reason it will never work, poor Americans with all the information on their phones are actually dumber than poor Russians with nothing but a hut to live in.\n\n\n\n",

Basically your old optimistic self from school gets farther and farther away, that's why it literally means \"school is farther away\".\n\nThe person who coined this term was the philosopher Nikolas Mullen in 1969, during the radio play \"Kamm-Taun\".

This kid is like the quintessential Peterson mark. He's early 20's, a bit awkward, looking for direction, looking for community, VERY smart and logical. He said he's aware of why many people dislike JBP, but he's been listening to his \"actual lectures\" lately and they're speaking to him.\n\nI gave him a very brief, trying-to-be-objective breakdown of why I think JBP is a proto-fascist. He said, well who would you suggest for \"that kind of in depth analysis of human psychology?\" This kinda caught me off guard, because he wasn't arguing, he was genuinely reaching out for some suggestions of people who have better fundamental ideas. I threw a few names his way from my limited knowledge of such things. David Graeber, William Irwin Thompson, Rick Roderick. I even suggested Alan Watts and Terrance McKenna, because I remember how much they spoke to me in a positive way at that age.\n\nBut I feel pretty unequipped to give him better alternatives, that he is actually genuinely seeking out. What are some other figures I should point his way?\n",
