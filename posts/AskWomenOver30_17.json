        "text": "Mature women's views on relationships change as they get older and more experienced. When we were younger, relationships were probably one of our biggest concerns, but as we get older, we have a deeper understanding and perspective on relationships.\n\nFirst, mature women focus more on true connection and sharing. Unlike young women, they don't see fleeting feelings and romance as the only criteria for love. For them, a successful relationship requires real connection and sharing, based on mutual understanding and respect rather than mere appearance and superficial attraction.\n\nSecond, mature women are more self-aware. They have learned who they are and what they expect and need from themselves. Therefore, they do not easily put their own needs above their feelings, nor do they give up their own values and beliefs in order to meet the expectations and needs of the other person. Instead, they will assert their values and beliefs and seek equality and consensus in the relationship.\n\nAgain, mature women place more importance on emotional intelligence. They have learned how to express their emotions, how to understand each other's emotions, and how to deal with the challenges and difficulties in relationships. They have learned that relationships are not a romantic fantasy, but require honesty, patience, and empathetic effort and dedication.\n\nFinally, mature women are more confident and courageous. They have learned how to maintain their self-esteem and dignity in relationships and have the courage to abandon unhealthy relationships or people who are harmful to them. They believe that they have the ability and wisdom to build a healthy and fulfilling relationship.\n\nIn short, a mature woman's view of relationships is based on an understanding and respect for herself and her relationships, as well as the pursuit of emotional intelligence and confidence.",

Whenever we’re talking and he tells a joke/laughs at something, he’ll grab my shoulder and then quickly run his hand down my back. It doesn’t seem sexual, but I still find it super weird that a dude 30 years older than me would think it was okay to do that to someone he just met four days ago. There’s only one other woman in the office. Should I ask her if he does the same with her? I just started working there, so I don’t want to make the situation any more awkward for myself than it already is. I know the obvious answer is to tell him to stop doing that, I’m just not sure how to go about it. Any advice would be appreciated!",

        "text": "I (34F) am the type of person who's super intentional &amp; genuine about everything. If I'm in, I am in 110%. When I date, I tend to be very selective and go for quality &gt; quantity. I'm not super selective about physical or material things, it's more about energy, values, and personality.\n\nEven when I'm dating a couple guys at the same time, I'm genuinely interested in getting to know all of them and they're each getting my very best without getting prematurely attached to the person or the outcome.\n\nIt's really exciting when I come across men with a similar approach to dating because we can figure out if we could be right for each other pretty fast without wasting each other's time. But I also (and more often) come across guys with the opposite mindset: casting a wide net, dating anybody and everybody to see what sticks. That sort of energy's usually not super compatible with my approach to dating (it doesn't feel great to bring your A-game to a date with a guy who doesn't remember your name) but I can usually spot it early on and know if/when it's best to move on.\n\nBut also on the flip side, even if I'm being 110% myself, I can acknowledge being so \"intentional &amp; genuine\" can come across a bit intense in early dating. For some guys it's exciting &amp; refreshing, for others it's overwhelming &amp; a turn off.\n\nI want to try to be more open-minded and be able to relax and enjoy getting to know men who might be really different from me, even the guys with different approaches to dating. I'd love to meet someone I can be serious with, but I don't want to force anything or settle for something that's not the right match for me.\n\n**So ladies...**\n\n**What's helped you change your approach to dating without compromising your values?**\n\n**Or have you had more success attracting the right person by staying true to yourself?**",

        "text": "This may be a simple answer but I am in a bit of a dilemma, so here it goes. Apologies for the rant: \n\nI've been separated from my STBXW for almost 2 years now. I stayed on the lease for 'her' apartment for this entire time because I wanted to keep things stable for my daughter (9) and step-son (15), and we both weren't sure if she'd make enough to qualify to stay there. I moved in with my parents about an hour away, and we split time with my kids fairly evenly. In addition to this, my kids are still going to their schools zoned by her. \n\nFor a while this wasn't so bad, especially since the company I worked for had work in that area, and so I was more or less going that way anyways. However, the pay wasn't great and I would occasionally be sent to work to other parts of the state, so I managed to get a job in my areas BIG employer for more pay and much better commute. I work 3rd shift, which is sometimes a struggle, but its the best I can do for now.\n\nLast month after I got home from work, I lay down and get a call from (x)SIL who has been giving STBXW a ride to/from work because of car problems. There's a guy in the neighborhood that's been giving them the creeps and been getting weird around them. Long story short-ish, I've been staying the night 2-3 nights a week to keep an eye on things and help around. She doesn't feel safe waiting at the bus stop with/for my daughter, walking the dog, and taking out the trash, so I've been doing that. ALSO came to find out, that she and her BF broke up last new years(2021-2022).\n\nDuring this time, we've all kind of done a few things together sort of like a family again(Movies, restaurant, shopping, and mini-golf). She's also made several comments about how \"We should\" and similar stuff that has me thinking she might want to try us again. My mind/feelings have been all over the place , and I came to the decision that I would ask her if she really was still set on getting a divorce or if she wanted to give everything another try. I also decided to wait on asking anything until after she gets her car fixed/sorted so that I would get an honest answer without any perceived threat or pressure. \n\nNow Back story basically over: I was driving her to random errands yesterday(V-day) and we were talking about random stuff (Me avoiding that it's V-day), and she casually asks if we can stop by Video XXX (Adult store/not actual name). I said \"sure\" and kinda blanked because I was trying to remember what video stores we still had, but it finally clicked. She went on to mention that her last item was run out, and that she guess she needs something more durable for \"Self-Help\" day. I drove her there more out of shock and auto-pilot than anything. \n\nEverything finally sank in **again**: I'm an ATM/handyman/baby-daddy and that's all I ever was and will ever be. Later that night I finished fixing one of her appliances and left with my daughter for the night. When she asked why didn't I just stay the night, I responded along the lines of not wanting to overstay my welcome and so that she can have her privacy. \n\nGuys, I am just tired. I want to help my kids and her, but I'm just feeling used up now. I fell Cucked. I've deluded myself into thinking that I might get that hallmark ending again somehow. I barely have a savings because I keep helping her with rent and random little things. I don't really have a social life because all I ever do is work, drive, and sleep. I can't keep this 4+hour commute each day I take my daughter to/from school. I live in the area where we both work (not same company by still same area). I told her today that I'm gonna transfer our daughter to a good school by me, and didn't even get a reaction.\n\nBottom line is, I'm done. I just want nothing to do with her anymore. I know she can't really afford to live where she is on her wages. Her sister has been insisting that she move in with her, but STBXW is backing out because they don't really get along when under the same roof for long. \n\nWould I be wrong for telling her that I'm not going to be on her next lease come December, and stopping my extra funds for her lifestyle? December is when her lease is up, so it gives her time to find another place; despite the apartment she's in now might be the cheapest place around. And Yes, I do plan on forcing the divorce subject and hopefully get it done this year (hopefully).",

        "text": "I've been in therapy on and off for the past 6 or 7 years. I have a lot of anxiety, which I was recently medicated for, and I've been doing a lot of self-reflection, meditation, and self-helping to try to figure out the roots of some of my issues.\n\nAnyways, I feel like every therapist I've had I've felt \"meh\" about (and I've had 4 so far). Like they've all been nice, they've listened, but it feels like I'm talking to my mom or a friend. They haven't pushed me or challenged me in any meaningful ways.\n\nI know sometimes it is a personality/style mismatch, but I think part of it is definitely that I haven't been clear about what I'm trying to get out of therapy. I've been seeing my current therapist for about 6 months, and I'm thinking about finding a new one because I feel like I haven't been getting much out of our sessions. But I'd like to try to talk to her about what I'd like to start getting out of therapy to see if it can be improved. I feel anxious about this (of course!) because I'm not exactly sure what to say or what *exactly* I want to work on. What I know is that I want to stop going in there, updating her on my life for an hour, and leaving.\n\nAny tips/advice would be much appreciated!",

        "text": "I've (30) been with my partner (34 m) for around 4 years now. He doesn't drive and he lives a nearly 3 hour bus ride away from me. He works evening shifts and wakes up at around 11 every morning because he gets home from work at 2 am. \n\nYesterday I had to go to the hospital to get a colposcopy and  few biopsies taken of my cervix. I told him I was feeling really nervous and worried and scared because I just had my IUD put in a month or so ago and it was low key traumatic (seriously why haven't we figured out a more humane way to place these things? Nobody should be up and awake and feeling all the forceps and pulling and prodding going on ) and he knew that I would be a nervous wreck going there alone. \n\nYou know what this man did? He got home from work at 2 am, went to sleep by three am. Woke his ass up at 7 am and took a 2.5 hour bus ride to meet me at the hospital. He held my hand and stayed by my side the entire time, wiped my tears away and sat with me making conversation while the nurses and doctors did their thing and took their samples. Then we came back to my place, got maybe 2 hours of a nap in and I took him to work. Where he stayed until 2 am again. No complaints or anything. \n\nI'm writing all this out to let you know that if your partner wants to be there for you they will. There was a post here about someone who's partner kept skating around and chilling while his gf was in hospital for an endo flare up and it really stuck with me.\n\nIve had partners in the past who literally watched me turning blue during an asthma attack and couldn't be arsed to get up and take me to the emergency room. Thry called 911 and watched me crawl out of the apartment on my hands and knees to meet the paramedics because i was unable to stand up and breathe at the same time. At the time I was 26 and I made excuses like \"it's a 25 minute walk from our apartment to the hospital and it's cold out\" or \"he works too much and he's tired.\" and \"he does care for me hes just not very good in a crisis\". \n\nI was there for a whole week and this dude never visited me once. in fact when I came home he laughed and made a joke of the whole thing, about how I was turning blue but he qas in the middle of a raid in Destiny and so he couldn't stop. I wasted another year with this asshole pretending I found this funny but my gut was telling me something was wrong the whole time. \n\nMy current partner would NEVER. I can 100% confidently say and know that . The moral of this story that I want to hammer home for all you younger ladies who are wondering \"why does(n't) my partner do this?\" or \"do they really care for me? \" is this: \n\n__If your partner wants to care about/for you and put you first they would. You will know when a partner cares for you and truly loves you. You won't have to ask these questions, and waste time making excuses for them. I'd like to encourage you to really look at these relationships that cause you do much anxiety and stress and confusion and ask yourself honestly whether they are showing you that they care about you. When people show you who they are and what their intentions are please listen to your gut feeling. And stop making excuses for these ain't shit partners. You're worth more.__",

        "text": "So… a few months ago, my bf asked me what I wanted to do for Valentine’s Day and I told my boyfriend that I wanted to go these cabins that are about 2 hours away from us. I requested time off from work and everything because I assumed that’s what we’d be doing. He ends up telling me two weeks ago that all the cabins are booked for Valentine’s Day (which I already knew they would be because it’s the beginning of February). He gave me the option to push the date back or we can go somewhere else which I was fine with. \n\nHe ends up claiming that he’s booked a room for us (a week after Valentine’s Day) and made reservations for a massage and dinner. While I did appreciate the gesture, I was very annoyed that we couldn’t celebrate Valentine’s Day on the actual day and instead will have to push it back. I assumed that he would have made the reservation for the cabin shortly after saying we could go and not waiting a few weeks before Valentine’s Day to book it. He’s notorious for doing things like this which annoyed me even further.\n\nSo a few days before Valentine’s Day, I start to develop a sore throat and fatigue. I just knew that meant that I would be sick on Valentine’s Day as well. \nWhenever the day gets here, my boyfriend surprises me with 3 dozen roses and 6 balloons. I thought it was cute and expressed my appreciation.\nHe then mentions that he got on the wait list for a local restaurant so that we could have dinner. Of course I’m sick so I tell him that I’m still not feeling well and that we won’t be able to go out to eat. That’s when he suggests picking up ingredients to cook later…so I’m like okay cool, I couldn’t go out anyway so that was perfect.\n\nWhenever he goes off to work, I went to several stores to pick up a few little gifts for him, a card and a gift card. He texts me a few hours before he leaves work to ask me what all he needs for the dinner and I tell him what he needs to pick up. Whenever he finally got home, I just flopped down  on the couch and looked at his phone for about 30-45 mins. In my mind, I’m wondering if he is going to start trying to prepare the dinner. He ends up getting in the shower and me, trying to be a good person, decides to start trying to prep everything for dinner. I was going to actually start cooking everything until I remembered that he said he was going to cook so i stopped and waiting for him to get out of the shower. After he finally gets out the shower, he comes in the living room and automatically sits down on the couch and starts looking at his phone. At this point, I’m just wondering if he is going to get up to start maneuvering in the kitchen or even ask me if I had a recipe but nope. After about 30 minutes, I get up and get my thinks to head to bed.. as soon as I get up, he says “did you need me to help with anything?!”. \n\nThis infuriated me because he said several times that he would cook. I certainly expected to help him but the fact that he wanted me to basically tell him what to  do irritated me. He doesn’t cook often but he has made a meal or two before so it’s not like he couldn’t find a recipe and start cooking.. the fact that he asked me if I needed his help really made me so mad.\n\nI won’t lie I am a little resentful about how Valentines Day went but I don’t want to tell him. I also feel so crappy for feeling so unappreciative of his gift as well. He ordered the flowers and ballon online at a local grocery store the day before… no card or anything. To many, it might be very sweet but it came off as very lazy and non-romantic. I mean I went to several stores while sick to pick out things for him and it wasn’t cheap. It’s not like I was expecting a designer bag or anything but for him to only get me roses and balloons, you would think that he would’ve taken the initiative to actually cook dinner especially considering the fact that I am sick.\n\nAfter all of this, I told him I didn’t want the food anymore and just went to bed early. \n\nShould I confront my boyfriend about this or just leave it alone?",

He also said he'd get takeout.\n\nThe only thing I actually wanted from him however was a nicely written card. So I gave him a blank card and envelope I already had and asked him to please just write something nice for me. \n\nCome Valentine's Day, he wishes me in the morning but that's the only acknowledgment I get all day.\n\nAs soon as I come home he asks what's for dinner, I told him I wasn't cooking so he made himself some chicken tenders.\n\nNo card. Which is the one thing I wanted.\n\nHis excuse was that he tried writing a few drafts but didn't get anywhere and then ultimately forgot.\n\nI am upset and frankly feel pathetic and embarrassed. \n\nMy boyfriend couldn't even write a nice message in a card. He didn't have to buy the card, it was already given to him. He didn't have to guess what I wanted because I clearly told him but I still get nothing.",

Maybe I’m with the wrong person? Maybe I just never really had this dream in the first place? I’m curious if marriage/kids/ that sort of life is something you’ve always known you wanted (or not wanted) or, have you just sort of followed the direct path in front of you to end up where you are? Is your life, as it is today, something you thought long and hard about? Or something you just “did”. Is a wedding really something “little girls dream of” and I just never had this dream? Or is that all a bunch of BS that movies push on us? Vague-ish questions I know-I guess I’m just wondering if and how you knew what you want your life to look like.  Any input appreciated.",

Some validation would make my day. \n\nI broke up with someone because they screamed at me, which should be enough reason, but I have suffered previous abuse. What helped was, post-breakup his (my ex's) roommate's gf told me a weird story and several things I was completely in the dark about came out... \n\nTurns out, roughly a week before he screamed at me, I was out of town on a work trip, she (roommate's gf) was staying over with her elderly dog (had been doing this since he - my ex - had moved in, so not uncommon whatsoever). She got up at 3 am one night to let her dog out (very common), and when she went to open the door, my ex charged at her screaming, \"Get the f\\*ck out!\" \n\nTurns out he thought she was their neighbor trying to break into their house...through the front door. Why? Turns out my ex had yelled at their neighbor one night about making too much noise for talking outside and listening to music. Here's the weird part: when I talked to my ex later that day, he didn't tell me about screaming at his roommate's gf. Never mentioned it. Wasn't planning on ever telling me. \n\nAlso, never apologized to her the next day to clear the air (he did apologize in the moment, once he realized). He also never told me about the issue with his neighbor (which, apparently escalated and continued on). And, turns out he had been asking his roommate's gf to help with letting \\*his\\* dog out when we were together, which he also never told me about! And, even though she did, gladly and for free, he would trash talk her to me and he never thanked her. \n\nThis is all weird, right?",

I have lost any goals or aspirations I once had - everything seems super unachievable and beyond reach. I don’t have half as many friends as I thought I would have - and dreading next year when I turn 30 - I have very few people I can invite to a birthday. \n\nI also have this horrible feeling that time is running out. I do want children, but am also totally aware that life pivots dramatically after having them and they become your priority - and worried that I have missed the prime years to really find my individual place  in life. \n\nAny advice or guidance?",

One of my knee jerk habits is saying “no worries!” when someone acknowledges they did something annoying/hurtful etc. when in fact there are “worries.” What are some handy phrases for what I can say instead?\n\nFor example, today at work, one of my coworkers came 5 min late to our meeting after I messaged him and asked if he was coming. When he came in, he said “sorry I always seem to be late to our meetings,” which is true, it’s been this way for months. I didn’t want to say “no worries” because it WAS annoying and felt disrespectful of my time. But I also didn’t want to escalate it. I ended up saying “Thanks, I appreciate that,” but I felt like it came off weird and passive aggressive? Idk \n\nWould love any thoughts!",

It's nothing major but an increase is an increase. I'm extremely lucky to have a place to myself. I currently pay $1,500 and they are proposing an increase to $1,650.\n\nI did some research about what the increase limit would be and from what I've read the maximum increase is 2.5% on buildings that were occupied as residential before November 2018. I checked my building's dates and it was built 11 years ago so I fall in the before November 2018 category. So technically that means they can bump it to $1,537.50 or ($1540 to round up).\n\nAlso worth mentioning that last year in 2022, they tried to increase it to $1540 but backtracked and left it at $1500.\n\nPart of me just wants to say yes to the $1,650 because it's still extremely low for the place and area I'm in. I'm also a bit afraid that they could just decide to list the unit again at a higher price and bump me out.\n\nAny advice? Thanks in advance!",

One cause was being lonely in the relationship with him. Cause of the break up I lost all family of his side.  \nI have some friends, one is my sister by choice and I try to see them regularly but it sometimes is difficult with beeing a grown up and all the things which go with it. I try to check in with them and stay in contact but sometimes I drift away because of my depression. I like spending time with them, with different people and meet new people easily. I even have a boyfriend/ friend with benefits relationship but in the end it seems its never enough. Everybody goes back home and I'm lonely again. I drown my feelings in internet scrolling through webshops or reddit and so on and it hurts me.   \nI always felt kind of different and kind of not likeable. I know its not true but in my deepest core of beeing I feel like I'm not worth beeing loved and people are unable to love me because me beeing me.  I started therapy again with a new therapist and I will work with her on that theme but I want to know if somebody feels similarly and if they found a way to deal with it?   \nPlease don't explain the difference of being lonely and be alone. I'm so deeply lonely thats really that and it hurts me deeply.   \n\n\nSometimes when its really bad I try to cheer up or help strangers in the internet. That helps often but it passes quickly as well.   \nI spend most of my time in auto pilot and try to feel as little as possible by numbing myself with input from media or internet. So there is so much pain and I guess one reason is the loneliness.",

        "text": "I am 31F, and have a friend, Alice 30F, who has been in my life since early 2019. Upon meeting Alice, I also met another male friend, Joe 31F, and they started seeing one another mid 2019 (I did not introduce them - we ran in the same circles). I would see Joe mostly at events, and found him to be nice enough, but clearly (to everyone) he was very self involved. Alice and I grew close almost immediately after meeting, and she is charismatic, talented, beautiful, hard working…she’s got it all.\n\nSince late 2019, she has gone through hell with this guy. I won’t get into it but in the early days I would even call him emotionally abusive / manipulative. They were ‘casual’ but she gave him the girlfriend experience anyway, and he disrespected her more times than I can count. His excuse would always consist of falling back to the argument that they were not exclusive so he could do what he liked. Alice didn’t do herself any favours accepting this behaviour but it was still very hard for her, and I spent many nights in 2019 with her at my house crying over him. \n\nAfter the third or fourth time he’d done something shitty, I politely told Alice that I could not hear her talk about Joe anymore because she would come to me for advice and would not heed it, and ultimately I didn’t think he was good for her and they shouldn’t be together. I made it clear I would always be there for her, but this was a necessary boundary I had to put in place. Alice understood completely and agreed to it. \n\nDuring early 2020, when covid hit and lockdown began, they must have circled back to one another again, as they decided to “give it a proper go” and started dating officially. They dated during 2020/2021 and seemed relatively happy. They moved in together in early 2022 and bought a cat. \n\nIn mid 2022, Alice had dinner with me and advised me that she was having second thoughts about Joe. To list a couple of concerns she was having, Alice said she never felt loved by him, she didn’t feel like he was ‘her person’, he had never taken her on a date(??), he was impulsive with his money, he never contributed to buying furniture for their new house, he didn’t want to work full time so she ended up having to pay for things more… basically she was feeling taken advantage of and that he was just there because they had a nice house and a cat together. I think it must have been really cathartic for Alice to speak so openly about it, because right after dinner, she went to her sisters to talk to her about it, and then she then went home and broke up with Joe. I was shocked to hear that she’s made that decision (given her history I thought it was going to take her a long time) so I supported her through the break up, and helped her move him out of their house. It was all amicable - they just finally realised they weren’t compatible and both felt it was time to move on. \n\nCut to today, I find out through a friend that they’re back on after Joe posted a pic of Alice for Valentine’s Day. I haven’t heard much from Alice lately so it all adds up. \n\nIt’s always hard seeing remarkable women dating low value men, but it’s even more cutting when your friend keeps on making the same mistake over and over. She tried dating and has 100% put herself out there, but she has told me that she’s still ‘always looking for Joe in men.’ I’m deeply saddened that she’s given up and gone back to what she knows and honestly I don’t even want to bring it up, which I know is selfish…but it’s just all so exhausting. \n\nI’m looking for some advice on what I can say / do when Alice inevitably shares this information with me that they’re back on.",

While the conversation has been consistent and engaging, with him really making an effort, I started to become tired of just messaging. I find that you really can't know if you click with someone until you meet in person. To be honest, I was expecting that he would have asked to meet by now and I had been dropping some fairly obvious hints (at least in my mind) about grabbing a coffee.\n\nSo I bit the bullet and said to him that I'd prefer to meet in person rather than keep messaging. He took quite a few hours to respond before saying that he'd really like that too and would have asked me sooner but he randomly is really busy over the next couple of weeks. \n\nHe works a daytime job that isn't hugely time-consuming. As far as I know he doesn't have any kids. I guess I'm just wondering how someone can be so busy for 2 weeks straight that they can't even squeeze in a drink or coffee for an hour after work or on the weekend.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I being too harsh? Or is there potentially something he isn't telling me? I'm not looking for a pen pal so the idea of messaging for another 2 weeks without meeting is putting me off.",

This particular friend group seems to revolve around one person holding court and he's somewhat intolerable to me now. He's always high, he talks over me and ends up dictating the night. Everyone else adores him - he's very funny and personable, but I can't with his lack of consideration at times. Plus, he's in another friend group of mine and he never hangs out with us. He *always* has plans with his new, younger friends. There's some jealousy involved on my part because a part of me wishes I could be so charming to others, but not like this. \n\n I'm done with the routine of this friend group's gatherings, too. We get together at someone's place, we do edibles, watch or listen to stuff on YouTube, maybe play Cards Against Humanity or some similar game. It's so tired and the last time we hung out, I lied about having other plans just to leave. \n\nNow, they want to hang again to celebrate birthdays. I don't want to be a jerk but how can I communicate that I'm not interested in hanging out anymore, really? I can take some people individually but altogether, this group - I don't want to waste my time. So how can I do this, respectfully lol?",

        "text": "The longer I've been single the more I have leaned into becoming totally self sufficient - being able to hold down a job while doing all the chores, cooking all the food, supporting the friends and family, taking the dog out, saving for big things like buying a home or raising a kid on my own etc. Self soothing when there is no one around to do sweet things or help out. Coping with feelings of loneliness. Finding ways to manage my mental health. \n\nI keep feeling like the only thing that I cannot achieve on my own, or with the help of my close friends and family, is the satisfaction of a physically intimate relationship. I feel like it's making my judgment worse when I am dating and I put more weight on the wrong things. I would love to have a partner who is stable, kind, a great person to start a family with - but feel like I focus so much on the physical aspect of things because, well, for better or worse I've managed to figure out everything else. The most pressing need that I feel, honestly, is physical touch. So on dates where someone is very nice, but I do not want there to be any physical contact, I find myself wondering what is the point of being in a relationship with someone who provides the things I can already do for myself, but doesn't provide the one thing I can't do for myself? \n\nWould getting a FWB help so that I'm less focused on thirst when I'm on a date? I'm not sure if that would be counterproductive when trying to date with intention. But it's the only possible solution I can think of. \n\ntl;dr having to meet every single one of my own needs because I'm single, is maybe breaking my picker?",

        "text": "I have a friend who I feel \"bread crumbs\" me. She only communicates sporadically when it suits her, enough to keep up appearances but no real substance or connection.\n\nHer pattern is to initiate a conversation and then ghost. And then 3 months later she might be like, \"Wow it's been months since we talked!\" and then she'll start another conversation that she's not going to reply to. For what purpose? To pretend she's not being rude and neglectful?\n\nIt happens over and over and over to the point where it's a running joke with my boyfriend where I say, \"lol why am I even replying?\" Then sure enough. It's to the point where it's not authentic and I have nothing to say. Also it doesn't feel authentic for someone to repeatedly come back and say \"omg it's been so long!\" or even \"Sorry about the delay! How ARE you?\" after disappearing. My answer at this point is: Um, why are we doing this?\n\nPreviously I had to stop doing things that were unreciprocated like gifts or happy birthdays or being the therapist friend. And I remembered how often she had referred to herself as selfish, and I decided to pay attention to that because I was feeling really bad in the friendship. It turns out the friendship really was all about her, and I grieved that and adjusted my behavior.\n\nNow I'm just left with this bread crumbing where for months I used to answer genuinely and try to keep in touch, because I thought that would be an ok level of friendship to hold. But now I'm not interested in this. Not interested in her at all. I have too much going on and this feels like an unnecessary and insincere game.\n\nShe may not mean any harm but it is really hard on me with my trauma history and will ruin my day or days. And in any case there's no ability for an authentic friendship in this dynamic.\n\nMy feelings are that I don't hate or blame her, I'm just not interested in having this in my life. I don't feel like correcting her or explaining or officially ending the friendship. Do I just stop replying and be the bad guy?\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts and advice on how to handle a \"bread crumber\" or if you've ever been in this situation.",

I've not really dated like this before so I'm brand new to it all. I've been working on myself a lot since the breakup nearly 8 months on, and I am enjoying single life so far. \n\nBasically, I met a guy on tinder in December, I honestly wasn't sure what I was looking for going into it, mostly just to brave a first date to see if I could do it. we went for a date and I slept with him that night. After that, he began drifting etc, and only ever texted me to see me for sex after that. I wonder if sleeping with him on the first date meant he didn't respect me, and placed me in the \"fuck buddy\" box. \n\nI have another date coming up with a man I met on tinder. Because this man lives 30 miles outside my city, I am not sure whether he intends to get a train home after our date in the city or if he expects to stay with me. I don't know how to approach this because what if I decide I really like him and would like to sleep with him? But I also don't want that pressure in case the chemistry isn't great and have to take him home.\n\nLong story short - do men lose respect for you when you sleep with them straight away? \nIs it better to hold off even if the chemistry is good on the first date? \nAny book I have read tells me never have sex on the first date. But a lot of my relationships have started with sex on the first date, so I'm honestly just confused about how to go about any of this. \nAny insight would be appreciated!",

        "text": "\nJust to preface, I’ve (28f) been with my boyfriend (26f) for over 3 years now. We have a sweet, loving relationship. He’s expressed wanting to marry me and I hope to marry him as well but I’m not pressuring him.\n\nSomething I’ve noticed recently is that every time I hang around one of my cousins, she ALWAYS asks me when are we getting married. I didn’t mind the question at first because it seemed innocent but it seems like every single time I am alone with her, she’s asking me when I’m going to get married and I don’t understand why she keeps asking. When I went over her house a few months ago, she starts asking me how long we’ve been together, I told her 3 years and she starts asking me when my boyfriend is planning to propose. She then goes on to say that she doesn’t “believe in shacking up” and that her husband proposed to her within a year of them dating. At this point, I’m extremely annoyed because it’s really none of her business! \n\nI went over her house a few days ago with her and one of her friends and she asks me about married AGAIN. This time I told her “I’m not in a rush and I don’t want to force him to marry me within a certain time frame because I want him to propose when he wants to, not because I forced him to.” She didn’t say much after that. \n\nNow, she recently got married a few months ago to her husband. At the wedding, my boyfriend and I went up to congratulate her after the ceremony and she starts saying that I need to be next and how he needs to hurry up and propose.\n\nI find it ironic that about a month after the wedding, my uncle (her dad) told my mom that he belittles my cousin A LOT. I won’t go into much detail but he calls her out her name and they seem to argue a lot. Of course, I think her husband is an assh*le for treating her this way but it really makes me wonder why she is always badgering me about getting married as if her own marriage is perfect.\n\nShe recently had another kid and whenever my aunt and I visited her in the hospital, she starts asking me when I’m going to have kids! I’m 28 right now so I plan to have kids around 32-33.. I told her this and she made a face and said “don’t wait too late” like oh my God, it just doesn’t stop. Mind you, her parents practically raise the child she has now PLUS I don’t even think she knows who her first kids father is. \n\n\nI’m at the point now where I want to just tell her to mind her business instead of commenting on me and my life. I don’t want to come off as rude but her life isn’t perfect and I wouldn’t dare to tell her how to live her life.\n\nWhat should I say to her to shut her up for good?",

But I was wondering if there are things I can do along the way. I have heard of “fake it till you make it” but it just doesn’t work for me. Whenever I get positive feedback I feel uncomfortable and don’t internalize it. Yes, I am working through this in therapy but am hoping to hear your insight.",

        "text": "As the title says, I finally had the courage to cut off a situationship that had been going on for 9 months. \n\nIt took all my strength to do it and I feel so much grief. I feel shame for allowing it to go so long without commitment. But also grief because I feel I’ve lost a friend.\n\nIt all started off a dating app, he was recently separated from his 2nd marriage and was texting me every day, made it a priority to see me, remembered the small details, we’d always go out and not just “netflix and chill” but I think that was also partly because I set that standard early. Our dates were long - sometimes 8-10 hours long before we even went home.\n\nHe made a move on the 6th date but I wasn’t ready to have sex (needed to get to know him more), and then the next time we saw each other he said he thought we were just “friends”, which threw me as he initiated hooking up the time before. So this whole date I’m processing that he just sees me as a friend. Next minute he’s walking me home, holding my hand, and we slept together.\n\nHe was acting relationship-y for so long. But I had to have the convo to clarify where we were at, at 3 months in - and he said he doesn’t want anything serious. And wasn’t seeing anyone else but still on the apps. We agreed to be friends (not fwb).\n\nI started pulling away and dating other guys - and suddenly he’s coming back and asking me to sunset dinners, which he never did before. I stupidly got my hopes up. Slept with him again. Then he stopped initiating contact for 3 days and it escalated to a week or more.\n\nI think he would test me and play mind games to see if I would chase. He would only “ghost” me when I wasn’t available to see him last minute or if I took too long to respond to a text (even when away at work because he worked away) - basically when he didn’t get his own way.\n\nI do get a lot of attention from other men, and I know I’m attractive physically and fun, kind, smart, my lifestyle is set up (I’m not bragging just trying to set a picture), but this guy never complimented me. We would go on “dates” and other people on 5 different occasions came up to compliment me on how I looked! He would ignore it.\n\nHe would also ogle other women so obviously and actually miss what I’m saying. And I don’t mean to sound rude, but it was basically ANY woman not like drop dead gorgeous women (I know that’s subjective) but I’m trying to paint a picture - basically it seemed like he was trying to get their attention, for validation that HE was desirable if that makes sense? As he would try so hard to catch their eye and smile. As well as being one of “those” guys who adds a lot of women who post thirst traps.\n\nAside from all this, he seemed so different to guys I would usually go for (very narcissistic, macho, gym bro, party types), and had a gentleness about him.\n\nAnyway I realised it was going nowhere so I pulled away for a few months and saw others more seriously. Didn’t reach out to him. Didn’t accept his advances and catch ups. Sometiems didn’t respond to him…\n\nI think he sensed he was losing access to me, so suddenly, he wanted to call me and talk and initiate more contact - but ultimately, nothing changed. He just told me how great his life was doing and I guess he still saw me as an easy target. Though he did seem supportive more recently when I broke down about an assault incident (I didn’t go into details with him), but before that I felt my emotional needs weren’t met.\n\nANYWAY:\nI finally pulled the plug the other day. I sent a text thanking him for his time but that I needed to move on. I blocked him before I could see his response.\n\nI’m feeling regretful and anxious and that maybe I should’ve held on longer, maybe I’m not good enough, all the what ifs are creeping in\n\n\nPlease be kind, I’ve had a lifetime of abuse from childhood into adulthood (all kinds including SA, emotional, physical) and bullying . I’m often told I’m “too nice” I know I’m a people pleaser and the last few years I’ve tried so hard to assert myself and boundaries.\n\nIt doesn’t help when people tell me to have more self worth or respect - I know I need it, and I’m trying and in various forms of therapy (seems you need to see multiple therapists because they all specialise).\n\nSo I know I enable “bad” behaviour or don’t assert myself well - I guess my go to is to feel bad for other people and that they must be going through stuff / see the good / give benefit of the doubt.\n\nSo I guess I’m just asking for encouragement and did I do the right thing? Sending the message and blocking?\n\nI just didn’t want to be triggered by him again. I figured there was nothing I hadn’t already said about exclusivity.",
