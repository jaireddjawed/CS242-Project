It seems to me that in the last, more or less, two decades, historical center-left parties all over the world (with all their differences) have failed the task they've followed since the beginning of their history: they're no longer able to give voice to the social claims of the subordinate class. Often, they even seem to fear more parties or politicians at their left (such as Sanders in the United States, or Podemos in Spain) and in general parties that try to give voice to those claims (often in a populistic way). I'm not a historian, but I've always thought that this drastical change in the way center-left parties act is a consequence of the end of USSR and the so called \"real socialism\", but unfortunately that's how far I can go. Is this true? Can you explain more specifically the historical processes behind this change? Thanks to everyone. P.S. if the answer is not simple, don't fear the \"wall of text\": personally, I prefer a longer but better answer :)",

        "text": "Hey r/asksocialsciences, someone in r/askphilosophy asked me to crosspost this. I've done a lot of work in reading A Thousand Plateaus and trying to connect it with Dorothy Smith's institutional ethnography methodology for explicating the problematic of the everyday world. I think I'm on to something that hasn't been done before with Smith's institutional ethnography but I'd like some help or advice to make sure I'm doing justice to Deleuze and Guattari.\n\nI interpret assemblages as combinations of expressions (which I interpret as ideas about the world, how it is, how it's supposed to be or could be) and content (which I interpret as the physical realities of stuff in the world, like the realities people need to deal with when they set about doing something). I understand assemblages as uneasy combinations because expressions about the world can be quite different than what the content of the world actually is. This, I think, connects with Smith's theory that institutional texts about how people are supposed to do things are quite different than what is actually possible for them to achieve. Those institutional texts form a problematic for the people that need to work with their world to enact or achieve what the texts say. This places people into an assemblage where they have relationships with other people who work with the content of their everyday worlds to achieve what institutional texts express as what should be happening with them.\n\nI understand that assemblages are deterritorialized in three ways: 1) They are deterritorialized to other assemblages so other groups of people who work with different institutional texts as problematics become involved somehow in the first assemblage and these two assemblages will affect one another. 2) Assemblages are detteritorialized to \"eccentric immemorial and yet to come lands\" (which I interpret as basically saying that expressions of plans for how things should work don't always work as planned so unexpected shit happens and that screws up the work of the people in the assemblage especially if the expressions of institutional texts don't account for that unexpected shit). 3) Assemblages are deterrtitorialized to cosmic machines they effectuate (which I interpret as meaning the people in the assemblage affect the people in the cosmic machine, the \"machine\" or another group of people that produce the expressions or institutional texts about how things should be in the content of peoples' everyday worlds).\n\nDo you social scientists think I'm on the right track? My supervisors seem to think I am but I don't know how familiar they are with Deleuze and Guattari and every once in a while I think I'm just bullshitting about how well I understand them.",

The reason for that being cyber is creating a whole new space for human, and State, interactions that no longer are solely confined to that realm. The implications of how cyber relates to social science vary from the academic -- how does this new domain allow for opportunities to better understand the study of [x] -- to the day to day consideration -- is my research safe and/or of interest to another State?\n\nI hope we each walk away from this event with more insight into a rapidly shifting subject!",

When explaining their findings, they characterized the implications of a low score and a high score  on each trait and their descriptions were somewhat surprising to me. They seemed very clearly \"valued\" I guess? For example, \"Low agreeableness is characterized by traits such as being cold, unkind, uncooperative, selfish, distrustful, stingy, and hostile.\" or \"Low openness is characterized by traits such as being unintelligent, unanalytical, unreflective, uninquisitive, unimaginative, uncreative, and unsophisticated. \" Could someone with more experience in personality psychology tell me if these descriptions are fairly common? That is, is it generally accepted that it is \"worse\" to be low openness, etc.? I might just be surprised based on how high or low scores on traits are generally described positively or neutrally in the MBTI (although I know that isn't really used in psychology anymore). ",

        "text": "So when I hear discussions about racism and disagreements between those accused of racism and their accusers, the nature of of disagreement seems to move between disagreements about facts and value judgments without much clarity, so here's my problem:\n\nThe classical definition of racism is roughly the belief in inequality amongst various races. But is this \"equality\" a quantitative or qualitative distinction? Is the racist guilty of holding an incorrect belief? That is, are they mistaken about some set of facts regarding race? (Black people more naturally gifted at manual labor) Or... is the racist simply guilty of possessing socially unacceptable pro-attitudes regarding one or more races? (I prefer white people over black people, whom I generally dislike).\n\nBoth of my examples intuitively sound like racist statements. But if the division on racism is a factual matter, it seems like (in theory) this allows for the possibility of a racist claim being a factually correct claim, assuming empirical evidence leads to such a claim being true.\n\nOn the other hand, if disagreements regarding racism are inherently normative, I would think this would preclude the topic from scientific discussion altogether (other than the scientifically verifiable consequences of holding these normative beliefs). Critical race theory's pop version of the definition (racism=prejudice+power) may complicate this discussion, but I'm assuming it would have to be considered. My interpretation of this definition seems to remove the matter from a strictly scientific matter.\n\nNote: my background is closer to philosophy than social science, as you may have guessed. My attempt here is fleshing out the is/ought distinction as it applies to the approach of social sciences to race.",
