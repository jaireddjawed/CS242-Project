When there is a description of a character, imagining the characters very vividly with detail (also giving them voices for their lines). Imagining the scenary, background, the buildings. Thinking how the sounds would actually hear.\n\nReading detail informations that might not even be important to the plot, and try to understand it all, not trying to miss a thing (MacGuffins).\n\nWhen you can't remember some parts, reading previous parts which where mentioned or were hints.\n\nOn the other hand, there's speed reading. There are so many books, series to enjoy and are waiting to be read. Although wanting to read and enjoy thoroughly, time is limited while so many books. Even though not imagining the characters vividly, even though some information not absorbed nor understood, just bulldoze through and speed read to the end, and get the overall picture / plot. Some details maybe lost, but it's a compromise to read more books that are awaiting.\n\n\\------------------------------------------\n\nHow to compromise between these two.

I was driving to work and saw a yard that had a hill in it covered in daffodils and suddenly remembered being around 7 and going to the library with an older cousin. When I was a teenager in the early 2000s, rather than take away phone privileges for offenses my mother would take away trips to the library. It was devastating to me.. I literally just remembered keeping and renewing a book for so long that the cover fell off. It was an older hardback copy of a late 70s or early 80s novel titled A Kiss for Samantha. I don't remember much about it except the girl on the cover had Tatum O'Neal curls or Karen from A Nightmare on Elm Street. Just curls in a poof and very on brand for the early 80s. It wasn't a full romance novel with the smut but it wasn't a YA novel either. I cannot for life of me remember what it was about nor can I find it at the library where I would get it from (i.e. my hometown library). Searching online leads me to the Kiss novels by Samantha Lind... I need this book. I don't remember why it was so good but if anyone could help me I'd greatly appreciate it. I usually remember everything I've read no matter how vague it may be. Case in point: someone recommended Fifty Shades to me. Bought the first book got through the first chapter and realized I'd read the original fanfiction and that Christian Gray was Edward Cullen and Anastasia Steele was Bella Swan. It was very disappointing bc most of the book literally had name changes and most of the smut cut out. Anyhoo, can anyone help me find A Kiss For Samantha?",

        "text": "Hi there! I want to make a list similar to how Mortimer J. Adler made a list for the Western World, but instead of the western and orthodox civilizations, I want one which is centered around the Islamic civilization. I don't think it is possible right now to make a list as big as his but 50 books will be more than enough. This can help us find a coherent tradition and corpus of academic, non fiction and fictional literature, which will help us non Muslims and outsiders to get a grasp of the Islamic civilization but also help Muslims understand their world, civilization and intellectual tradition. If this is made possible, I hope to ask for several other civilizations such far eastern civilizations, indic civilizations and African civilizations, the list can also be made on national levels as well. But I want them to focus on civilizations for now.\n\nSome books I think are essential to add to the list. Obviously 2 of them would be the Qur'an, and the Hadithic Canon( mostly Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim). These serve as the literal and literary foundation for the Islamic civilization. Other than that I would definitely include Al-Muqaddimah by Ibn khaldun, The Epistle(Al-Risala) by Imam Al Shafi'i and the Meccan Revelations by Ibn Arabi. Obvious some books by Al Ghazali would have to be included such as Revival of the Religious Science, Alchemy of Happiness or Deliverance from Error, haven't read any of his source books mostly read about him so I can't be for sure. Others such as Ibn Sina's Al Shifa or some other of his books. Rumi's Mathmawi and of course some other literary books such as Antarah Ibn Shaddad or the famous 7 hanging odes. Some perhaps by Muhammad Iqbal as well might be useful, though it might stand short of the criteria, since I don't if it effected Islamic civilization as a whole or Muslims from other parts of the world. Some texts from the Shiis and the Ibadis should also be included since they also to am extent had an impact on the whole of the civilization. Far eastern, middle eastern, African, south Asian and the various diasporas of Muslims all around the world, any text deemed worthy should be included.\n\nThe criteria as far as I can think should be that the text is something that deepens your insight and understanding of the world while at the same time had an immense impact on Islamic civilization in general, or at least in some of it's major parts. This of course won't be a perfect list nor am I assuming will it be done by academics or ulema but I think it will be a good start.",

        "text": " The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is a thought-provoking book that encourages readers to think more deeply about what really matters in life and to let go of the things that don't. Another key point in the book is that failure and pain are inevitable  parts of life, and that we should embrace them rather than trying to  avoid them. Manson believes that we can learn and grow from our mistakes  and setbacks, and that they can even help us become better people in  the long run.",

I feel like after increasing the tension between the characters to a point that killing/removing one just seems redundant is superrr frustrating as a reader. Like authors please. If ur going to make that much build up stop offing the character and let them live for gods sake. I understand using angst and trauma for ‘character development’ but after reading about (specifically I feel) the three way relationships falling through every.single.goddamn.time it makes me mald like crazy. \n\nOn that note, does anyone have recs of a successful ‘mutual love triangle’ relationship I feel like I’ve been deprived of it from my most recent read.",

It beats the movie train spotting on utter depressing narrative power.\n\nIts Rabbit Run by John Updike. And I actually really enjoyed the cathartic nature of the book being a father and husband myself… but holy cow I have never read a scene in a book and then had to put it down and gone to bed that shaken. I am not usually shaken by depressing shocking narratives. I feel like sometimes it’s because theres not enough consequence or build up. Or its hinting at a worse possible scenario but never gets there. And for whatever reason Rabbit Run got there for me. And its powerful like reading your worst nightmare you’ve always played over and over and didn’t even know existed until the author slowly draws it out in a shocking build up. I am really undone by this book.",

Specifically, my idea was to have several, maybe 5-8 different sizes to choose from so authors still have some creative liberty but still provide a uniform size. I shared my idea with my dad, and he mentioned he thinks that a books size and exterior appearance greatly contributes to the book's character and charm, and that standardizing this would take away some of the magic. I stand by my belief but I was wondering what other people thought. Do you think making all books the same, even given some variety in the size, would take away from the charm of them?",

K. Rowling, English, 1997, 120 million\n\nAnd Then There Were None - Agatha Christie, English, 1939, 100 million\n\nDream of the Red Chamber (紅樓夢) - Cao Xueqin, Chinese, 1791, 100 million\n\nThe Hobbit - J. R. R. Tolkien, English, 1937, 100 million\n\nTake the time to scroll down the Wikipedia link and maybe see some of your favourites score higher or lower in sales than you might think. And also glance at some now forgotten best-sellers of past years.\n\nThese are my personal feelings about the top seven books:\n\n- Don Quixote is like the first really modern novel ever written, and also the first meta-novel, where the author uses post-modern perspectives. I found it a pretty hard read, but the translation that I used may have been clunky.\n\n- A Tale of Two Cities is my fave Dickens novel. It's also his shortest. I could relate to the sighing romantic protagonist Sydney Carton.\n\n- The Little Prince is awesome. Saint-Exupery also wrote some amazing prose-poetry about early aviation experiments: 'Night Flight' and 'Southern Mail'.\n\n- Potter is a modern classic for many of us, but I feel badly about the author's more recent awkward opinions.\n\n- I haven't read Christie much, but I've watched many of her film adaptations.\n\n-  Dream of the Red Chamber: Regret I'm not so familiar with it, but it's definitely on my reading list now.\n\n- Hobbits are the first step into Middle Earth. I picked it off the shelf when I was young because of the fascinating sleeve design by the author. I was recently thinking about The Nibelungenlied and how it influenced Tolkien.",

That was going around the world's the Engineers came from to find organisms that previously had been unable to adapt to the Ringworld to see if they can survive there now (although I don't understand why they'd be doing that 🤷).\n\nThen, after becoming stranded on the Ringworld they posed as gods.\n\nSo it's seemingly implied that she's one of the builders...but then it says that that the survivors of the fall of society didn't buy into it.\n\nSo that implies that Prill was an Engineer and that there were still engineers there ..but that most people weren't builders.\n\nDo I have that right? So where did all the non builders come from?",

I love the backdrop and setting of the French Revolution for the primary protagonists (which I think to be Lucie Manette and Charles Darnay). Despite not having been to France (according to GK Chesterton's afterword/introduction), Dickens captures the Revolutionary spirit so thoroughly. There is considerable gore in the novel, before and after the revolt. I think he entangles the political climate of both nations to the utmost.\n\nI do prefer Great Expectations because that was all and all Pip's story. I love how Estelle matched the tsundere archetype perfectly.",

Before this the Idiot was my favorite, though all of his books I have loved. After finishing this one, I can say that I have a new favorite. The plot itself I wouldn’t say is necessarily amazing, more so a tool to convey and argue different ideas he has stuck in his own head. The way he conveys these ideas in characters and how they live their lives and beliefs is masterful. The arguments and dialogue between characters at times is the peak of literature for me. I know for many the story telling may be dull and slow and super long but not for me. Totally understand why this book isn’t for everyone, but I will be reading it again. Overall would recommend to anyone who enjoys Dostoevsky or philosophical books - 10/10.",

This is the longest story I have ever read. I found myself genuinely caring about all of the characters - I must admit that as I was reaching the end, I did start to feel that it was dragging on somewhat, and that the infamous scene stopped me in my tracks (I was giggling uncomfortably whilst reading the infamous scene. I still can’t believe that that was published.) I have seen the films before, but the book is (unsurprisingly) far better. I must admit that I wasn’t a huge fan of Adult Bill (if I were to explain why, I suppose that that would be a spoiler.) This is easily one of the strangest stories I’ve ever read, and yet it was such a page turner. A part of me can’t quite believe that I am done with it - I want to read more about the Losers Club and their escapades, to know more somehow about Pennywise. I am happy, because when this school year started (I am a senior in high school) the thought of reading a 500-page book intimidated me. I successfully completed “The Secret History” about four-five months ago, and have now read a novel that was over 1,000 pages. I can certainly see why this story was a bestseller. I was impressed throughout with King’s attention to detail, unique ideas, character development, and understanding of the human mind. I am not the type that is easily frightened, and yet there were certain points wherein I was hanging on the edge of my seat. Brilliant novel (in spite of that one scene.)",

I then sort of \"read\" the book - but never completely or in the order the pagination suggests is proper.   Most often, the books which receive this hybread treatment are non-fiction and are semi-related to my professional interests.   But I did \"consume?\" all of George Eliot this way.   \n\nThe Wealth of Nations was perfect for this format.   Smith is brilliant, dryly funny, and encyclopedic.   Unfortunately for the page-bound reader he's among the few people in history entranced by the year by year fluctuations in corn (wheat) prices and currency exchange rates since coinage appeared lo those many centuries ago.   If you're hamstrung by a conviction that skipping ahead isn't good reading manners, you're thrilled to let those prices roll sonorously by as you empty the dishwasher or take out the recycling.  \n\nThis was also great for Michael Wood's Story of China because I could hear the pronunciation of names that would have been irritatingly unknown to me had I only reading them on pages.   And finally, I am the belated, exasperated, \"reader\" of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century, which would have taken me as much of the century to finish in print as providence will allot me (probably a much smaller chunk than if I hadn't picked up the book and downloaded the audio version.)   He writes as though what he's substantively got to say is in a reception line being exhaustively introduced as it shuffles up to the reader.   But it's a long, long line and it so likes the readers attention that it and, loops back around to be reintroduced again, assuming in error, it won't be remembered.  Again and again.   The publisher may have required that produce something as physically imposing as Marx's Das Kapital.   Otherwise, it's fair to say that if he's being haunted by a specter, it's prolixity.  \n\nFinally, it let's me indulge my favorite, but too rarely accommodated love of reading in streaks - 3 books in a row on the Russian Revolution that came after a couple on the French Revolution and one on the American because the commute means no interruptions and no FONDSMoP (Fear of not doing something more productive.)\n\nBut despite all these advantages, is this according to Hoyle or am I debasing myself?",

She complains about her father, her brothers, her grandparents, her boyfriends, her therapist, her coworkers, even herself. Constant griping doesn't make for an enjoyable read. She does seem to have good relationships with Colton and Miranda but she doesn’t delve into those relationships.\n\nShe doesn't even assign any redeeming qualities to herself! I read the whole thing in hopes that she would transcend the maladies foisted upon her and those she created herself but nope. She's still tolerating abuse from family members, she's still making choices based on the recommendations of others and she's still puking.\n\nI think she should have waited until she gained a bit more perspective to write this book because it’s heavy and vapid at the same time. She’s not her own person. She doesn’t trust herself yet. She’s clearly still in her trauma and I feel like it’s muddling the writing. Ok I'm done complaining, lol.",
