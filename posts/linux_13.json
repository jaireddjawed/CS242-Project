Now, I do understand that this app is great if I learn how to use it, but I don't have time to learn something as how to manage gimp for drawing a simple diagram once in a few months and neither should I or any other linux user be expected to. We should not be expected to spend hours and hours learning how to use GIMP just for the privilege to occasionally scribble something.\n\nPS: Not saying GIMP is bad, but it should be a upgrade for those who need it than the freaking default.",

Very simple and traditional, but easily customizable and can be made to look great.  Panel system is the best.\n* Distro choice - Mint \n   * good defaults OOTB - themes, Redshift, sticky notes, software/update manager, default repos, no snap \n   * Xubuntu good but a bit more \"raw\" - just Ubuntu + Xfce, some swapped apps, harder to setup a good theme\n* Use LVM LUKS \n* **move /home to separate drive** \\- this one was tricky so wrote down the steps, tried to stick to GUI where possible\n   * create partition and filesystem in Disks\n      * create partition, format as ext4 with LUKS \n      * `sudo cryptsetup convert /dev/&lt;device&gt; --type luks2` &lt;-- use LUKS2\n      * create ext4 fs in decrypted device \n   * copy data \n      * `sudo cp -rp /home/* /media/&lt;user&gt;/new-home` &lt;-- move stuff from existing home dir\n      * `sudo cp -rpi /media/&lt;user&gt;/Data/* /media/&lt;user&gt;/new-home` &lt;-- move stuff copied from old OS\n   * recreate /home dir, unmount new partition, mount it to /home, log out \n   * setup auto unlock and mount \n      * Encryption Options, Unlock at system startup, add \"luks,discard\" options, set any passphrase \n      * update passphrase to random: `dd if=/dev/urandom of=/etc/luks-keys/&lt;device&gt;_crypt bs=512 count=4` \n      * `sudo cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/&lt;device&gt; /etc/luks-keys/&lt;device&gt;_crypt` \n      * Mount Options, Mount at system startup, Mount Point /home \n      * **backup fstab, crypttab, LUKS header** \n   * resize if needed with GParted &gt;= 1.3 in live session\n\n# Maintenance \n\n* **Backups - What's closest to Arq Backup on Windows and Mac?  Seems like restic, borg, and kopia are most recommended.  And just use rsync for local backups, or one of the other tools?**\n   * set up Timeshift\n* enable auto updates and maintenance in Update Manager  \n\n# Configuration \n\n* run sensors-detect, add Sensor plugin for something like HWMonitor on Windows\n* Variety nice wallpaper switcher\n* install heif-gdk-pixbuf \n* Add Thunar custom action: `gpg -c --no-symkey-cache %f` to easily encrypt files\n* Add Thunar Open With: `gpg %f` \n\n# Theming \n\n* Pick from variety of default Mint themes \n* Stick with Xfwm4 + Compositing \n* for nice looking panels, try black with some % opacity \n* Some useful PPAs \n   * https://launchpad.net/\\~xubuntu-dev/+archive/ubuntu/experimental/ \n   * https://launchpad.net/\\~xubuntu-dev/+archive/ubuntu/extras \n   * libxfce4ui-nocsd if you hate CSD \n\n# Apps\n\n* mate-calc for more traditional calc \n* Meld for folder diffing\n* GParted\n* gpm for mouse in consoles \n* Mousepad - Xfce text editor\n* gnome-system-monitor \n* for VMs: QEMU-KVM, Virt-Manager \n   * install packages \\^\n   * add yourself to kvm group \n   * restart\n\nI'm not saying any of the above are the best choices or ways to do anything, Linux is all about choice.  But hope this is helpful for anyone new just looking to get started with something a little Windows-like.  And thanks for any backup recommendations, there's a lot of posts on it but they're hard to assess, and I was very happy with Arq previously.",

I wish him the best.\n\nReading through this, and recalling many other similar situations, I'm wondering:\n\nWhy don't more people dual license their code?\n\nI could be having a major lapse in my thought processes here, but that seems like a very viable solution to the current leech problem. A lot of popular projects just throw BSD/MIT/Apache licenses on their projects and call it a day, then corporations will come in and plunder their projects while they gain nothing. \n\nI disagree with the idea that true freedom is allowing anyone to do whatever they want with your creations. Is it truly freedom when we get great software at the expense of the freedom of the people who have brought us that software?\n\nFOSS is a cost saving measure for these corporations, and it always will be. I think that a sane approach would be to AGPL/GPL projects, and then for corporations provide a commercial license.\n\nThis has worked out great for companies like GitLab. While they not using a copyleft license, they do have an open core model along with a commercial license. Other projects that come to mind are BitWarden, MySQL and OnlyOffice.\n\nFOSS is about the community at it's core, why should we treat companies like they are apart of the community when they only exploit it?\n\nCorporations already do this in reverse. They open source some parts of their projects, but lock it down so much in other ways it's basically impractical to build anything for yourself with what they give you (Android, MacOS Darwin kernel, etc).\n\nLet me know if I've got the wrong idea here though. I'm by no means a developer and I'm aware there are things that I may not understand.",

I went to setup fscrypt and discovered the bundled kernel did not support EXT4 native encryption, the option was disable in the kernel's config.  I opened a case for this issue, asking for either a packaging build recipe for rebuilding the bundled kernel with this option enabled.  Both my own efforts, and support informed me that enabling this breaks with the kernel ABI, as such, vendor support won't be helping.  They also said that enabling EXT4 encryption opens a security risk, but did not elaborate.\n\nCan someone tell me how a long included feature of a standard Linux driver module (ext4) breaks compliance with the kABI and what security risk is created by enabling it?\n\nI have a use case for file level encryption with user controls that I was hoping to solve with fscrypt + EXT4 encryption.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "1. Will it finally help bring HW decode/encode on browsers like firefox by default on linux, even on nvidia? As it will be cross-platform and supported by all the players.\n2. More efficient perhaps? \n3. As these extensions expose the video encode/decode engines of the GPU via the Vulkan API, will this replace existing APIs like VA-API, NVDEC, VDPAU, v4l2 once VP9, AV1 support are added? Like one API to rule them all.\n\n**What is Vulkan Video?**\n\n* The open standard Vulkan API from the Khronos Group enables  applications with flexible, low-level GPU acceleration, including  fine-grained control over scheduling, synchronization, and memory  allocation. \n* Vulkan Video seamlessly integrates hardware-accelerated stream  compression and decompression with the full power of Vulkan. This  enables developers to combine GPU rendering and compute acceleration  with video processing within a single efficient run time. \n* Vulkan Video opens new opportunities for applications such as  inferencing and training for machine learning, video editing,  intelligent video analytics, video transcoding, game and movie  streaming, and even virtualized desktop experiences.\n* As an added bonus, Vulkan Video is the industry’s first cross-platform video acceleration API, enabling software portability  across multiple operating systems and hardware vendors.\n\nLinks with more info:\n\n* [GPU-Accelerated Video Processing with NVIDIA In-Depth Support for Vulkan Video](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/gpu-accelerated-video-processing-with-nvidia-in-depth-support-for-vulkan-video/)\n* [An Introduction to Vulkan Video](https://www.khronos.org/blog/an-introduction-to-vulkan-video)\n* [Finalized Vulkan Video Extensions for Accelerated H.264 and H.265 Decode](https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-decode#)",

        "text": "Hello people,\n\nI have absolutely no idea how to compile a project for my\n\nRaspberry Pi (the first one Model B) running I believe 32bit OS\n\nOutside of the actually Pi's environment. I have used so far Make compiler (can't quite remember what my issues was)\n\nbut so far Meson Build has been awesome and easier only thing is the builds I got (both stripped and not) spew\n\nand error on the PI of GLIBC\\_2.33 and GLIBC\\_2.34 for both stripped and not stripped builds when executing.\n\nAnyways tldr, the projects I'm trying to build is the [flashrom.org](https://flashrom.org) project but specifically to \n\ncross compile it for the PI since that will make making builds a lot faster and convenient.\n\nCross text file from:\n\n[https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/tree/master/cross](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/tree/master/cross)\n\nThe build command I'm using (with and without -Dstrip=true)\n\nsudo meson setup -Dstrip=true --cross-file ubuntu-armhf.txt \"/home/amd\\_dev/Downloads/flashrom-4ba6-patched-armhf-build/\" --reconfigure\n\nI'm open to any solution even if its not Meson and something else so I can get my feet wet since I\"m completely new to Linux\n\nSo far I got it running by means of copying the project to the Pi and compiling it that way.\n\nThank you :) \n\n[ GLIBC\\_2.33 and GLIBC\\_2.34 after cross compiling for PI from Ubuntu Jammy](https://preview.redd.it/df8cusc6y7ia1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=647cbf0019e18c93f022e2f5a4c2d9e822b84ed7)\n\n[ \\(Native compile with Boris Baykov 4BA\\/6 patch applied\\)](https://preview.redd.it/fnm5llc6y7ia1.png?width=679&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d33afb786b0f60a561ae4f9cf9e04d4961f24d0d)\n\n[Native compile \\/ Works nicely though](https://preview.redd.it/k99rxlc6y7ia1.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9316fba5de842938b9b79b92cb5acf36e4644081)\n\n[Native compile \\/ Still nice](https://preview.redd.it/m1wcznc6y7ia1.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0e3aa2cd4ac536f1f682ae4e53e6ad01a4a44b7f)",

The author(s) are working  on an update. Meanwhile, scrolling can be restored by reconfiguring XMBC: either disable the Make scroll wheel scroll window under cursor  option in the global settings, or enable the Disable scroll window under  cursor option if using a custom profile for Firefox.*\n* On Windows, third-party modules can now [be blocked from injecting themselves](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/identify-problems-third-party-modules-firefox-windows) into Firefox, which can be helpful if they are causing crashes or other undesirable behavior.\n* *Date*, *time*, and *datetime-local* input fields can now be cleared with Cmd+Backspaceand Cmd+Deleteshortcut on macOS and Ctrl+Backspaceand Ctrl+Deleteon Windows and Linux.\n* GPU-accelerated Canvas2D is enabled by default on macOS and Linux.\n* WebGL performance improvement on Windows, MacOS and Linux.\n* Enables overlay of hardware-decoded video with non-Intel GPUs on  Windows 10/11, improving video playback performance and video scaling quality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Fixed:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Various [security](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2023-05/) fixes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Changed:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Colorways are no longer available in Firefox, at least not in the  same way. You can still access your saved and active Colorways by  selecting Add-ons and themes from the Firefox menu. Additionally, you  can now install Colorways from all of the previous collections by  visiting [Colorways by Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/collections/4757633/colorways/) on the Mozilla Add-ons website.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n## Enterprise:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Various bug fixes and new policies have been implemented in the latest version of Firefox.

Sometimes files are changed multiple times per minute, other times, just one time for a few hours. \n\nOn both servers, csyn2 and lsynd is configured, and everything works flawlessly until one of the hosts goes down. \n\n    settings { \n            logfile = \"/var/log/lsyncd/lsyncd.log\",\n            statusFile = \"/var/log/lsyncd/lsyncd.status\",\n            statusInterval = 1,\n            nodaemon = true,\n            insist = true\n    }\n    initSync = {\n            delay = 1,\n            maxProcesses = 1,\n            action = function(inlet)\n                    local config = inlet.getConfig()\n                    local elist = inlet.getEvents(function(event)\n                            return event.etype ~= \"Init\"\n                    end)\n                    local directory = string.sub(config.source, 1, -2)\n                    local paths = elist.getPaths(function(etype, path)\n                            return \"\\t\" .. config.syncid .. \":\" .. directory .. path\n                    end)\n                    log(\"Normal\", \"Processing syncing list:\\n\", table.concat(paths, \"\\n\"))\n                    spawn(elist, \"/usr/sbin/csync2\", \"-C\", config.syncid, \"-x\")\n            end,\n            collect = function(agent, exitcode)\n                    local config = agent.config\n                    if not agent.isList and agent.etype == \"Init\" then\n                            if exitcode == 0 then\n                                    log(\"Normal\", \"Startup of '\", config.syncid, \"' instance finished.\")\n                            elseif config.exitcodes and config.exitcodes[exitcode] == \"again\" then\n                                    log(\"Normal\", \"Retrying startup of '\", config.syncid, \"' instance.\")\n                                    return \"again\"\n                            else\n                                    log(\"Error\", \"Failure on startup of '\", config.syncid, \"' instance.\")\n                                    terminate(-1)\n                            end\n                            return\n                    end\n                    local rc = config.exitcodes and config.exitcodes[exitcode]\n                    if rc == \"die\" then\n                            return rc\n                    end\n                    if agent.isList then\n                            if rc == \"again\" then\n                                    log(\"Normal\", \"Retrying events list on exitcode = \", exitcode)\n                            else\n                                    log(\"Normal\", \"Finished events list = \", exitcode)\n                            end\n                    else\n                            if rc == \"again\" then\n                                    log(\"Normal\", \"Retrying \", agent.etype, \" on \", agent.sourcePath, \" = \", exitcode)\n                            else\n                                    log(\"Normal\", \"Finished \", agent.etype, \" on \", agent.sourcePath, \" = \", exitcode)\n                            end\n                    end\n                    return rc\n            end,\n            init = function(event)\n                    local inlet = event.inlet;\n                    local config = inlet.getConfig();\n                    log(\"Normal\", \"Recursive startup sync: \", config.syncid, \":\", config.source)\n                    spawn(event, \"/usr/sbin/csync2\", \"-C\", config.syncid, \"-x\")\n            end,\n            prepare = function(config)\n                    if not config.syncid then\n                            error(\"Missing 'syncid' parameter.\", 4)\n                    end\n                    local c = \"csync2_\" .. config.syncid .. \".cfg\"\n                    local f, err = io.open(\"/etc/\" .. c, \"r\")\n                    if not f then\n                            error(\"Invalid 'syncid' parameter: \" .. err, 4)\n                    end\n                    f:close()\n            end\n    }\n    local sources = {\n            [\"/var/opt/mihai/folder1\"] = \"folder1\"\n    }\n    for key, value in pairs(sources) do\n            sync {initSync, source=key, syncid=value}\n    end\n\nand the csync2.cfg look like \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    nossl * *;\n    group folder1\n    {\n            host server1 server2;\n            key /etc/csync2.key;\n            include /var/opt/mihai/folder1;\n            auto younger;\n            backup-directory /home/mihai/folder1_backup/;\n            backup-generations 3;\n    }\n\nwhen server2 is going down I got in lsyncd logs: \n\n ERROR: Connection to remote host \\`server2' failed.\n\n Finished with 1errors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny way to automatically restart the sync process when the server comes back up? The only method is to restart manually the service for lsyncd. \n\nAnd this is the configuration of lsyncd.service:\n\n    [Unit]\n    Description=Live Syncing (Mirror) Daemon\n    After=network.target\n    \n    [Service]\n    Restart=always\n    Type=simple\n    Nice=19\n    EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/lsyncd\n    ExecStart=/usr/bin/lsyncd  -pidfile /run/lsyncd.pic $LSYNCD_OPTIONS\n    ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID\n    PIDFile=/run/lsyncd.pid\n    \n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nThe issue is that I stated in lsyncd configuration insist = true, but is doesn't help. Any suggestion would be appreciated.",
