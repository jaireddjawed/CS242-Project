My professor noted if I had gotten 2-3 more questions correct I could have received an A-. My professor also said essay was very good and I had zero deductions on the essay portion of the exam. \n\nAs a result, I’m looking for ways to improve  before Spring midterms and finals. It appears the best way to start moving my exams from B+’s into A territory would be to figure out how to change my approach to multiple choice questions. So any suggestions are appreciated! \n\nMy school’s curve is at a 2.67 (so low!) and I ended up with a 3.35 for the fall so I over performed on the curve in every class but there’s still room for improvement.

I have planned this out meticulously and carefully visualizing this every single goddamn day I am obsessed with becoming a lawyer I count the days to begin college and then to begin law school. I AM SO CONFUSED ON WHAT I WANNA STUDY FOR UNDERGRAD THOOUGH LIKE… however I am sure I want a major and a minor to really diversify my knowledge. My top choices are political science (I’ve already seen the hatred for it) English for writing and because it’s interesting with its literature imo, Psychology because it’s absolutely vital for a lawyer and everyone tells me that every day. Maybe finance for a minor im not sure I really dislike math but it’s really useful to have that skillset in statistics or finance. I think Psychology is my main for sure and English or philosophy as a minor perhaps or maybe finance.

        "text": "I'm a 1L applying for sumer internships right now.  My politics are squarely left-wing (though it's not something I go around advertising to people).  Long-term, I'd love to do something that combines legal and policy work (I'm also getting a policy-related grad degree), but I haven't figured out what that looks like yet.\n\nI'm applying to a lot of judicial internships right now.  My gut feeling is that I should only apply to intern for judges who are Democrats.  I worry that working for a republican judge could (1) create issues if policy arguments feature in a case, and the relative importance the judge and I ascribe to those arguments profoundly differ, and (2) create issues for me if I apply to work for a more progressive judge or policy organization later on, and they wonder why I worked for a conservative judge previously.\n\nBut obviously, as a 1L, this is all just speculation on my part.  Do I have it right?  Are my worries overblown?  Am I ascribing way to much importance to partisanship in what is supposed to be a non-partisan job?",

I’d love some extra research tips before going into firm work but I feel like the research class may make my last semester a tad too intense. Thoughts?",

        "text": "Hello everyone. This is my first time on this subreddit and I gotta be honest I never considered seeking out a Law School subreddit (no offense). My Company is looking to send me to Law School and I am hoping to gather some advice from all you current Law Students in an effort to come to a good conclusion about if this is worth taking up.\n\nFirst some background:\n\nI am a 25 yr old Male living in Georgia. I work for a small privately held commercial real estate firm (think crunching numbers, creating models, etc.) . I graduated from a small college with a subpar GPA (3.2) with a degree in finance. My work primarily consists of financial underwriting but I also get to dip my hands into a lot of other buckets at work like asset management and property tax litigation. We own many properties throughout the country and get into many lawsuits over issues such as property taxes, tenant bankruptcies, lease defaults, easement agreement issues, etc. While this work is something I have taken on at times, I have never quite understood the \"law\" side of it and usually just do some grunt work for our in house legal team. The work can be pretty dang monotonous at times and its not what I get excited about when I come in. I have never once in my life considered becoming a lawyer.\n\nThe dilemma:\n\nI have been at this company for three years now and the Owner has taken a liking to me and wants to advance me at the company. (Sidenote: He is a well known business man in the state with many connections and a net worth well in excess of $200M.) He has joked before that we need a \"litigator\" on our team that can work on the acquisitions and dispositions of our properties, but also who can go to trial on some of the other cases that we face like the ones I listed above in the last paragraph. He approached me with the offer to attend law school on his dime, with the caveat that I will have to work here for 10 years following to pay off the debt. We have not gotten into specifics yet on the structure of such an agreement and what the compensation would look like, but I am a bit intrigued by the offer. Like I said above I have never truly considered Law as a path that I would follow in the future. My career plan has always been to grind out the Real Estate finance path and eventually go out on my own and build a portfolio for myself.\n\nOn one hand, I think this is not for me because 1) I have never had a passion for law in the past, so maybe that means Im destined to fail in such an endeavor, 2)I have looked at some LSAT prep questions and I am utterly lost in the sauce on the logic stuff - My forte was always math  and 3) what If I go through law school and start working here as an attorney and realize that I hate it? The idea of having to perform depositions or going to trial doesn't really excite me. (which we haven't really had to do because our cases usually settle, but still its a large possibility)\n\nOn the other hand, I think this could be extremely beneficial for me in my \"ultimate career plan\" to build a portfolio on my own. I could go in and do my time, and If I don't like working at this company after 10 years I will leave and start my real estate portfolio then with an even bigger toolbelt because I will have worked in industry for 10 years AND will be an attorney. And who knows maybe I will end up liking the law and have an affinity for it. But really my only concern is whether or not this will help me achieve my wealth building goal more efficiently or not.  I understand if anyone reading this thinks I am a self serving pile of mud, but my life goal and dream is to build generational wealth through real estate and I think this would be helpful for that. Obviously the only draw is the \"free tuition\" plus I would keep my salary while I am at school, but then I am effectively stuck for 10 years. The compensation is pretty good at this company, but would I be worth more somewhere else? What is the opportunity cost?\n\nIn conclusion, I am extremely lost on this dilemma. I am hoping strangers on reddit can give me an indication of \"Hey this might be worth it especially for a free education\" or \"Don't do it you will regret it for the rest of your life\". Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this.",

Then you enter a community where everybody has been/is just as smart as you and you're expected to compete against them. Challenge accepted. \n\nIt's a hit to the ego when you don't make the grades you're used to acquiring. I've wondered about my intelligence, my future in the legal profession, my competency, and even my self worth over a B-, and worse than that honestly. You have to find worth outside of those grades because there is literally nothing you can do about a transcript. Although, law school ensures that said transcript is one of your most important and prized possessions. But what if my transcript isn't that valuable? Does that mean I'm less valuable? The answer is unfortunately yes, and the legal profession forces you to reconcile that. It's all part of the game; weeding people out who shouldn't fit based off that one shot you give them at the end of the semester. \n\nI'm struggling with a grade I got this semester when I finally thought I was getting this law school exam journey down pat. I'm meeting with the professor obviously, but reconciling with whether this is the game I'm going to play for the rest of my life. \n\nNot necessarily looking for advice, just venting.
