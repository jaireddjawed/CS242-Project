So basically I have a weird pain that starts somewhere in my gluteus medius or around upper piriformis, and extends down to my ankle. I have been tested for disc hernia, piriformis syndrome, and other things. So far, depending on the pain and where it is, the tests come out either positive or negative for the things that I mentioned above. The only constant thing is the pain.\n\nThese last weeks I noticed a weird thing: my gluteus medius muscle hurts for no reason at weird times, my gluteus muscle group feels VERY tight upon getting up, and the pain I feel that descends from my butt to my ankle is extremely bad around my knee. I also find it hard to fully extend my leg from the knee down when I walk for around 5-10 minutes but it gets better once I sit or lay down and rest. Due to this, my mid-back muscles have been tensing up and I find it hard to keep my pelvis in the correct position and core engaged. I already had a slight case of lumbar lordosis, but I feel like it\u2019s getting worse. It\u2019s also hard to stay in the correct posture, and my core has weakened so much.\n\nWhat could this be?

So, I ended up just giving up. \n\nRecently, I started back with practicing. This time I decided to listen to my body, usually practicing every other days or every 2 days. \n\nI felt like the most important concept that helped me was to meditate before or be in a calm state of mind. Being able to get your splits is really about mind over matter, and I found that when I was more relaxed and calm I was able to hold my positions for longer (specifically my split position) than ever before. \n\nNow onto my routine. I would usually spend 15-20 minutes every other day or every 2 days or whenever my body felt like it practicing. I would first start in butterfly and hold that for a few minutes or until it felt right. Then I would stretch each leg individually. Then I would stretch in a straddle. After that I would prepare to go into my split by getting into that position and stretching my hip back. Then I would stretch my leg forward and ease into the splits. I would hold this position for as long as I was able to. But again, when I was in a calmer state it was easier to hold it for longer periods of time. Then, I would repeat all of that 2 more times (so 3 in total). It\u2019s one of those things where if you really want it you have to make time to work for it and it will happen :).

Sorry if this is too detailed and thanks for taking the time to read... I'm feeling really down because I can't exercise for several weeks, and I'm worried about this becoming a recurring injury.\n\nI was doing a basic shoulder stretch w\/ hands behind back and interlaced fingers. I tend to also look up to the sky to get a neck stretch in as well, with my fingers still interlaced.\n\nSuddenly, I feel this sharp pain in the lower-left area of my rib cage, right above the left ab muscle extending to my left oblique area. Basically if i poke in that lower left  area between the last two ribs, I feel pain\/soreness, especially on my side.\n\nInitially, it felt like something had shifted or popped. I thought I had a hernia or something.\n\nSitting down hurt, as did deep breathing, coughing, laughing, standing upright. The pain subsided after a warm shower and I ended up getting an x-ray and ultrasound. Doctor said nothing is wrong with me, \"probably micro structure trauma.. maybe the cartridge.. maybe inter-coastal muscles. Rest for 4 weeks then gradually get back to exercising. Go home.\"\n\nI'm worried because weeks ago, I first felt the soreness in that same area as I was doing a raised arm (Hasta Uttanasana) pose. I felt it a couple of weeks later as I was suspending myself for 10 seconds on the pull-up bar in the chin up position. I also felt that soreness after doing some pushups and ball Pilates.. I ignored the pain each time because it seemed minor.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Am I doing too much? Did you guys have a similar injury? What was your experience? \n\nNotes:\n\n\\- This happened during my morning stretching routine which I start almost immediately after waking up.\n\n\\- I'm 40 yrs old. I do body weight exercises 5+ times\/week (push-up, pull-up, squat variations) and I ride my bicycle everywhere.\n\n\\- I upped my workout in the last 6 weeks, and just a few days ago I was able to do 50 pushups in one go, and a total of 200 in one day.\n\n\\- I do yoga\/Pilates 3+ times\/week especially exercises that target lower back.\n\n\\- I'm a side sleeper, both sides. I play guitar with left hand on the fret board and usually raised for an hour or so in the evening. I do cooking\/dishes for the fam (daily) and I noticed that I tend to carry heavy pots and pans with my left arm as I scrub with the right.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1677129727.0},{"title":"Bawi\u0107 stretches for posture?","author":"pinguin_skipper","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/flexibility\/comments\/119eygq\/bawi\u0107_stretches_for_posture\/","text":"Hello.\nTotally freshman 31M here, never stretched before and always been very non-flexible.

For hip flexors I will do a lot of different leg lifts and for hamstring I will do standing hamstring curls for example. \n\nOne of my big issues is my lower back rounding when I try to do pike or pancake. I'm guessing this is a combo of tight hamstrings and weak hip flexors, but if there's anything else it could be please let me know. I can barely sit in pancake with a straight back and even when activating my quads and hip flexors to the max I could only lean forward a little bit. And with pike I feel like once I lower past a certain point, even if I don't feel a stretch in my hamstring my back will still just round and I cant do anything about it, I can't even get my back parallel without it rounding.

My flexibility is still a long way away from some of the bendy people on here, but I'm still super happy with the progress I've made so far and I've been loving the journey - which I think is the most important aspect for me. I started out with really bad mobility and I still consider myself very stiff compared to many people but I'm just happy that my range of motion has at least improved after all this consistent effort.  \n\n\nThe  hamstring-focused portion of my mobility routine usually looks like this:\n\n  \n\\- warm up with sciatic nerve floss x 20 reps each leg or until it feels good ([https:\/\/www.posturedirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/sciatic-nerve-floss-on-floor.jpg](https:\/\/www.posturedirect.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/sciatic-nerve-floss-on-floor.jpg))\n\n\\- elephant walks x 25 reps. I started out by just putting my hands on a yoga block as I could not do them with hands touching the floor. Over time I have gotten to the level where I can finally do elephant walks with hands on the floor ([https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MsUTFi24Iq4&ab\\_channel=Human2.0Fitness](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MsUTFi24Iq4&ab_channel=Human2.0Fitness))\n\n\\- isometric pike push 3 sets x 5 reps. I believe that I gained the biggest gains in terms of range of motion once I started incorporating this exercise into my routine. I started by pushing as hard as I could into 2 yoga blocks. Then I progressed to 1 yoga block. Then I progressed to pushing hands into the floor. Now I'm progressing by standing on a yoga block and trying to press my finger tips into the floor ([https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rjDtn-LttrU&t=254s&ab\\_channel=DominikSky](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rjDtn-LttrU&t=254s&ab_channel=DominikSky))\n\nI have additional exercises that I sometimes throw in and take out as my routine continues to evolve but those 3 are staples in my routine.  \nFor now, I'm currently focused on trying to improve my pike, pancake and middle splits flexibility. I know it will take a long time to get there but I believe that it's all about enjoying the process. I treat flexibility training the same as my strength training and am very intentional with much of my stretching. Similar to how I progressively overload my strength training over the course of weeks and months, I also try to progressively increase my flexibility by keeping track of a few different measures:  \n\n\n* Range of motion - does my ROM improve over time? (the ultimate goal)\n* Intensity - if I do the same range of motion but the stretch doesn't feel as intense as before. I would progress by going into a deeper range of motion so that the intensity is the same as it was before (intensity is rather subject in terms of how I perceive it)\n* Increase strength - taking the pike for example, getting further down into the standing pike is a combination of improved hamstring flexibility (and some calf flexibility) as well as improving the strength of the antagonistic muscle (mainly the hip flexors) to pull myself deeper into the stretch\n\nFor some great sources of content, check out Tom Merrick's channel for easy follow-along videos. Emmet Louis is also a great source of knowledge although I find some of his videos not as digestible due to the audio quality and accent. Dani Winks who I believe is a member on this subreddit has a website with some great articles too.\n\nIn terms of books, I would recommend reading Stretching Scientifically by Thomas Kurz.   \n\n\nHopefully this post was helpful to someone out there!","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676606066.0},{"title":"Fighting for my life in yoga class","author":"Damn_Amazon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/flexibility\/comments\/114cbua\/fighting_for_my_life_in_yoga_class\/","text":"I do several stretch-focused yoga classes a week.

I think its the tibialis anterior, but it could be the posterior, or a mix of both. I don't know. Regardless, is there any way that I can focus on the flexibility and mobility of that area? My current stretches for that is to sit in a deep squat and focus on driving my knees forward, which helps get a good stretch at the back of my foot. Not sure if this also applies to the shin, but its the only stretch I do that might apply to that muscle. Should I focus on working out the tibialis? \n\nRegardless...

This was years ago.\n\nToday, I was stretching randomly just chillin', a quick standing toe touch stretch. I felt really good so I was just slowly going deeper and my hamstrings\/everything felt fine, then all of a sudden something in my right stomach gets stuck and it hurts hell.

If you are overwhelmed by the high volume of information thrown at you, then this is for you.\n\nAs someone who is naturally curious and anxious, I've always ran into the issue of being extremely confused when mobility content creators recommend a bunch of stretches and mobilizations for different parts of the body. I would always have this nagging question of why I was doing certain stretches and whether I was doing enough. Categorizing the different movement planes has simplified the equation and helped reduce my confusion.\n\nThink about it this way--just train flexibility in every plane of movement for every joint.

That includes variations in the shape of your pelvis (hip bones), the shape of your femur (thigh bone), as well as all the soft tissue that connect the two (ligaments, muscles, etc).\n\nThat said, one thing everyone has in common is their femur (thigh bone) has a big club-like bump that sticks out on the top side of it (called the *greater trochanter*):\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/zrmpqvhqtsfa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=72c323080c2440efb72c301424d5afeed457db45\n\nAnd when we open our legs out to the side, depending on the shape of our hips, thigh bone, and how we are orienting the two, **we might accidentally crunch that big club-y part of our thigh bone into our hip bone (which is what leads to feeling \"stuck\")**. For example, here's what that looks like when you try to lift your leg out to the side when standing (and why you need to rotate your knee\/thigh to the ceiling to lift the leg higher):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5zp1cr6busfa1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7ceab2109d48a54a9de770e35e6d03544cb047c4\n\nSo two important points you've learned so far:\n\n* there is a lot of natural variation in hip & thigh bone shape person to person. That means **your hip anatomy is likely a bit different from someone else's**\n* **there are hip positions that can cause our thigh bone to hit our hip bone, causing a blockage**\n\nLinking those two concepts together, we can understand that **there may be hip positions that work great for some people when stretching the middle splits, but** ***because your hip anatomy may be different*****, you may benefit from choosing a different alignment that's a better fit for YOUR anatomy.**\n\n# OK - Now What to Do About It:\n\nThe easiest thing to do is work with a coach, they can help \"troubleshoot\" what positions work best for your hips, and what positions to avoid, to ensure you're getting the most effective stretch. This is something I frequently do with students with students in private lessons and it blows their mind to discover how less-crappy a frog stretch can feel (for example).\n\nBUT not everyone has the time\/money to work with a coach, so you should feel empowered to try different variations of hip alignment yourself, and trial-and-error the best alignment that works for you!\n\n* **Priority #1:** **Bone alignment** \\- meaning finding the best position that allows you to stretch without your bones \"getting in the way\" and crunching into each other\n* **Priority #2: Maximizing the muscle stretch** (in a position that you are actually feeling the stretch, and not just the bone-on-bone pinching feeling).\n\n# Middle Split Alignment Variables:\n\n**Hip-Knee-Ankle Alignment:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/oenawukjwsfa1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c05ee8e2c585ec1c1d3907d1c9632e47bf555b61\n\n**Pelvic Tilt:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/weho661lwsfa1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=79b0c00088f74d8c3f9cd9ba833d5af2e31fa583\n\n**Torso Position:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/7hucim4mwsfa1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=30a1842aa9a2216dd3a1330149e23c672e7fef0d\n\n**Thigh Rotation:**\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sp8mizenwsfa1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bdd5ba1fcf17ee87b371bca55258e47029174806\n\nWhen you experiment with those variations above, you may notice that one version feels like a good, productive, deep stretch even though I say \"usually this is something we want to avoid\" - **listen to your body!** That's the whole point of this post. Understand that there are cues\/defaults that work for many people, but you should be comfortable with exploring things in your body to help choose the version that works best for you.\n\nAnecdotally, from my observations working with lots of students:\n\n* *Most* people feel like they get the deepest, most challenging stretch from:\n   * Torso parallel to the floor\n   * Knees pointing forwards\n   * No pelvic tilt (or a *tiny* amount of posterior pelvic tilt, only if it doesn't feel crunch-y in the hips)\n   * Hips pressing back in line with heels, or even slightly behind heels\n* The second-most-common scenario I see is for students who feel pinching in the outside of their hips to benefit from:\n   * Anterior pelvic tilt (tilting the hips forwards), slightly arching the low back, or even dropping the chest toward the floor\n* That said, some students find the opposite the case! Some get more of a stretch from hips-forwards, etc.\n* *Very few students* have the hip anatomy to benefit from *internal hip rotation* (thighs\/knees facing forwards while the torso is lifting and hips are tilting backwards). This is a common variation in a lot of fancy middle split photos, BUT it is anatomically impossible for most people's hips. The vast majority of students will be more comfortable in a middle split with their thighs facing forwards, or a straddle with their thighs facing the ceiling.\n\n[Middle split with internal hip rotation](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/0vbqwwi5ysfa1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8f864e76015f64748f79043a6a4eff44b4af9342)\n\n[Another middle split with internal hip rotation](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ri0q4xi5ysfa1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0e95d65ac8de6f7842831f1c9214b79178398ba2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if you want to deep dive into this further, I did write an even longer [blog post](https:\/\/www.daniwinksflexibility.com\/bendy-blog\/proper-hip-alignment-for-middle-splits) on my blog that you might find interesting to read!","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675355508.0},{"title":"Form Check Friday! 2023-02-03","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/flexibility\/comments\/10shnih\/form_check_friday_20230203\/","text":"Welcome to Form Check Friday!

I had a set amount I was willing to pay each month for what is a unique combination of flexibility, women's support, nutrition and a group spiritual aspect, and when I found out the cost, it was within that, so I joined. I was member #500, and there are now 700. My hope has been that with more people, and with some questions I've asked Ilana personally, there would be more direction and more sub-groups created within the one Telegram channel (to accommodate people who speak other languages, those who are vegan, etc.) but that hasn't yet happened. There's one Telegram channel for the group to communicate with each other, and one channel where the recordings of the live classes are posted.\n\nThe live classes, which happen 6 days a week, have focuses that you'll see in the picture I uploaded. The schedule itself isn't proprietary, hence why I've included it. The first half hour of each session is a warm up series led by one of Ilana's associates who (I believe) have trained with her for a couple of years now. After the half hour or around then, Ilana herself logs into the Zoom call to provide guidance individually for class participants. This is becoming problematic for the community at large because there are so many people in the class in a Zoom chat, so I only watch the end segments of the recordings anymore. It's a great concept if you have a live class restricted to maybe 10 people, but there are 700 members currently, so I'm not sure how that will evolve.\n\nThe nutrition document is something Ilana has put together, noting she isn't a nutritionist. The main focuses include daily kefir, coffee enemas (your own schedule for your body, not daily), iodine, infrared light, and what most people would recommend for good health such as good sleep, paying attention to what's in your food, toothpaste and what you put on your skin.\n\nThe weekly not recorded, live spiritual group session is what I found especially appealing once I'd joined. The freedom of it being not recorded means anyone can speak freely about pretty much anything. These are hosted by Carla. The unfortunate aspect of it being only ever live means if it doesn't fit your schedule, you'll never be able to be a part of it. My own spirituality is major to me, and I've loved being inspired by Ilana's Method to incorporate some of her stretches as well as to make up my own to push my specific body in the ways I want, all while it being a kinetic prayer. This part is all me, not her method, and it's been my hope that I'd be able to 'shepherd' a group of others who might be on a similar journey that we could meet and talk about what's important to us. A similar subgroup could be created for those who are of particular denominations, or they're dealing with recovery and addiction, another element that is very dear to me. Right now there is only one channel and if the messaging isn't approved, it gets removed.\n\nEarly in my time I asked Ilana herself a slew of specific questions, including what her vision of the group is. Her answer was vague, and so I've been trying to nominate myself to help out with care and maintenance of sub-groups within the one crazy big communication channel. It is ultimately her program, however. My hope continues to be that since she wants to share this experience to a wide audience, there will be some kind of tiered system set up that could include free to the elite or lifetime or whatever. I continue to hope there will be a trend toward more inclusivity, and either to allow for more classes led by approved instructors so the physical positioning feedback can be more manageable or change the format altogether. My honest to goodness feeling is that Ilana herself started this and it's grown quickly and there isn't yet a plan in place for it to seamlessly transition to another level that can handle thousands of participants. It feels like we're outgrowing the space initially set up, and I really do hope Ilana and her small crew will take some time away from growing the community to really getting down to the nuts and bolts of supporting women and creating more structure to be able to provide that environment with more space.\n\nEDIT: I shared these concerns\/my thoughts with Ilana this evening on the phone (feb 15th 2023) and I realized that I've been trying to offer suggestions rather than figuring out how I can get to my own goals. That's a key distinction, so I'm going to try some one on one coaching sessions after  getting real about my own spinal awakening and what that means for me personally.\n\nI'm happy to answer questions- I've not written anything here that I haven't already shared directly with Ilana, and I am choosing to honor the proprietariness of the specifics. I'm interested in contortion myself and wish that more specifics about Ilana's Method were listed publicly and transparently as it would make for ease of people making decisions based on whatever is important to them, be it the cost, the time, the ethos, that it's women only, whatever. I've been watching a lot of contortion stretching videos to be part of my particular flexibility journey (I'm 53, btw, not 22) so if anyone wants to discuss those, I'm happy to!\n\nThis is super long, not endorsed by Ilana's Method, but I am a current, semi-active (I don't do the nutrition part) member who's made a couple of supportive friends in the program.

I took a 4 week split course in January (1 a week from 3rd - 24th) which was really helpful in learning how to engage the glutes and hip flexors properly, how to keep the hips squared, and how to keep an upright torso (these are still a WIP, but you can see between pic 1+2 that I was 'cheating' to get depth before). I also tweaked my leg day workout to have some more split focused exercises. \n\nThe gap difference isn't huge, but I feel like my form is a lot better and I have more endurance, so thought it might be helpful to share what I learnt in class :)\n\nWeekly routine: \n- 1.5 hour split course each Tues, the drills varied but each class had same structure which was: warm up, glute strength, hip flexor strength, hope flexor stretch, calf stretch, hamstring stretch. Stretches were a mix of active and passive\n- 1 leg strength training workout which is kinda tailored towards front and middle splits rather than your typical leg workout, I do 5 mobility\/dynamic stretches, stiff leg deadlifts, wide leg good mornings, hip thrusts, leg raises (pike + straddle), low lunge knee taps, assisted pistol squats, weighted frog splits, and then 5 stretches)\n- 1 split session (around 45 mins), I have a bunch of favourite drills and I vary which ones I use but would say my favourites are low lunge knee taps and low lunge holds, active half split, oversplit leg straighten, half split slides + half split lift, rounded back leg extension, weighted ankle rocks, wall quad + hip flexor stretch (passive + active)\n  \nI also do an aerial hoop class, calisthenics class, a vinyasa class, rocket yoga class, and rollerskate each week so I get some kind of hamstring movement every day, and I have a desk treadmill at home so 3 days a week I'm standing or walking most of the day rather than sitting (the other 2 days I'm in an office so sitting). \n\nWhat helped me the most:\n- Strength training and active flexibility. I was doing these already, but making 90% of what I do active or strength has definitely made a difference, the after picture was taken after strength training with only 2 minutes of hamstring static stretching and 1.5 mins hip flexor stretching\n- Learning how to create a neutral, square hip in 90 degree lunges and replicating that in any split work. I also never felt a stretch with these before and now it's such a good one \n- Focusing on hip flexor strength. Before I really concentrate more on hamstrings, and they are really tight but I think most of this progress has come from my hip flexors \n- Engaging the glutes and quads during a split. I'm still working on quads but the oversplit leg straighten block drill is helping \n- Breathing!!! I tend to hold my breath or breath shallowly in uncomfortable positions, so I've been really focusing on belly threating and taking deep breaths","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675073373.0},{"title":"I Started Yoga Fir Digestion But Its Impacting my flexibility What am I doing Wrong?","author":"Purple_Possibility30","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/CNeNgYH6Qd0","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1675191183.0},{"title":"What is my limiting factor in pancake?","author":"xcdp10","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/flexibility\/comments\/10pdbbn\/what_is_my_limiting_factor_in_pancake\/","text":"Hi all!

I understand that it's not gonna suddenly stop snapping over night but I'm just feeling a bit concerned despite doing these stretching\/exercises.\n\nAt least it's not really hurting other than the fact that I'll feel like I'm \"tiring\" it out whenever I try to perform a motion that'd normally cause the snap. I'm actually feeling like I'm trying to avoid those motions that would cause it to snap in fear that it'd make it worse or more fatigued. I was wondering is it normal when doing such exercises that are said to help improve it cause the same snapping sound? If so, that eases a bit of my concerns.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1674860948.0},{"title":"Some amazing ideas for crow, crane, tittibhasana, headstand and other stuff","author":"ArachNerd","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/flexibility\/comments\/10mlexv\/some_amazing_ideas_for_crow_crane_tittibhasana\/","text":"First of all, I want to say that I'm advertising for noone here.

I feel like all the exercises are way too advanced, except a few ones, even with yoga blocks, it felt really frustrating.\n\nI've read the FAQ and know I should really give it another try, really giving it my time, going slowly etc.  \nIt's just my first impression, I think maybe it would have been easier if there was a more beginner friendly video or if the same video was made but with using chair\/yoga block because the movements are not that easy to visualize. Considering the price of the programs, I was also expecting a bit more content. For example, some programs have additionnal stretches whereas other don't have any.\n\nFinally, during some of the movements that stretch the adductors, I feel the tendon at the back of my knee, on the inner side, in pain. Even holding the position 1-2s while feeling this pain at the tendon is enough to feel pain during the next 2-4 days at the tendon level. It's frustrating because 1-2s is barely enough to realize that it's already too late. Why is my tendon so weak? Is there anything I can do to prevent that? Should I stop doing the movements provoking the pain and try to find an alternative that doesn't trigger the pain while still triggering the nice adductor stretch?\n\nOverall, I really love the upper back\/shoulder and hamstrings routines, these are awesome.

I use a lacrosse ball against the wall for the back and sides of my neck and it helps temporarily and then I try to stretch\/rub the front of my neck also for temporary relief.   \n\n\nIs there an effective way I can completely make my whole neck not so tight anymore?
