A specific term was used to describe each approach/way of thinking of the past and I cannot remember these if my life depended on it! \n\nThe first term describes the way which the social sciences tend to look to the past for the existence of certain factors (or variables) that, when present, tend to produce similar outcomes even in different situations.  For instance, if X, Y, and Z are present in a certain context, the likely outcome will A. This way of thinking of the past tends to be formulaic and used to make predictions. \n\nThe second term was used to describe the way that historians tend to study the past to gain a better understanding of it and of current events but not to make to make predictions based on the existence of certain factors and not in a formulaic way.\n\nI hope this makes sense and  will be forever grateful if someone can tell me the names of these two terms.

        "text": "I've tried Googling for answer but never found a concrete one. I've learned back in secondary school that housing policies and planning should encourage a racially diverse neighbourhood, but I never questioned how it is done. My former teacher mentioned that the lack of promoting a diverse neighbourhood in some countries led to the issue of \"ghettoisation\" of locales dominated by social groups (particularly Muslims) in UK and France. If I remember correctly, some countries enforce arbitrary policies to promote diverse neighbourhoods through quotas (such as Singapore) but here in Ireland there is no such arbitrary policies because much of the accomodations are privately-owned and not state-owned. So how could governments encourage, rather than enforce, a mixed neighbourhood? I speculate that it might have to do with creating income-dependent housing? After all, \"ghettoes\" in the European context typically have the characteristic of being low-income. Is there a link between class and racial/ethnic characteristic of neighbourhoods?",

        "text": "One thing I noticed in America is, despite ubiquitous and homogenized expressions of patriotism, most white Americans are constantly insistent that they are not pure Americans, but some other identity fused with Americanism composed of one or more factoids about their ancestry. This can be something that results from genuine cultural impacts on their upbringing from past immigrant culture on their family, but a significant number of people have nothing much to do with much else as a primary identity other than being American. Yet \"American\" as a defining cultural identity is usually, by my account, not recognized. It's almost as if people are more interested in what makes them different rather than the same.\n\nThe other thing I've noticed is that this is by and large NOT the case for black Americans. While there are people involved in Roots culture, black Americans have, perhaps as a result of arising from a heritage broken by slavery with limited view of any culture before that mess, mostly been interested in identifying with black Americans.\n\nAnd I've noticed that some of the most resonant and uniquely American cultural creations have been products of black culture, such as jazz music and hip-hop. While both of these examples are inextricable from their African history, they are commonly regarded as American art. While jazz is not as popular as it used to be, hip-hop is extremely popular, across race boundaries. Particularly American sports like basketball and football also have high representation of black athletes. In general, it seems by my view that black culture plays a strong role in driving uniquely American cultural identity.\n\nI'm interested if there are observations like this in sociological literature. While general appreciation of the impact of black culture on American culture broadly as a general topic are interesting, I'm mainly interested in the bolder claim that black culture has a special role in determining and understanding American identity.",

Life is plentiful. Life is cheap in the Orient.\"*\n\nGeneral William Westmoreland in the Oscar-winning 1974 Vietnam documentary \"Hearts and Minds.\" \n\nWestmoreland's statement is political incorrect and arguably patently insulting.  But the underlying sentiment appears to have some truth, based on patterns of reporting in the media (eastern vs. western) and comments of political leaders.\n\nVirtually ever death of a U.S. soldier is highly publicized.   Of course, military deaths are a special category:  Reaction is in part political posturing over a perceived inappropriate handling of military affairs (both Bengazi and Niger).   Second, it is a patriotic reminder to all citizens of yet another America who paid *the ultimate sacrifice.*  \n\nBut there seems to be more than this here:  In the U.S. public anguish about unexpected deaths seems to be a collective catharsis, or at least a rite.  It is regularly expressed, sometimes nationwide, for just a few deaths, which could consist of anything from traffic fatalities to natural disaster.\n\n(I exclude mass shootings for two reasons:  1) They are virtually nonexistent in Asian cultures.  2) They are preventable.  Anguish can lead to actions to prevent reoccurrence.  Traffic accidents and natural disaster *[and losing soldiers in combat, IMO]* are less preventable and therefore are logically met with some equanimity).\n\nSome years back a commentator less provocative than Westmoreland observed that the heavily populated Asian nations regularly suffer the deaths of thousands in earthquakes, floods, and other natural disasters.  For this reason, he observed, these nations did not adopt the practice of becoming overemotional about small numbers of humans deaths.  Part of everyday life, if you will.....\n\nAny truth to these comments?  \n\n\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/22/opinion/derrick-z-jackson-the-westmoreland-mindset.html?_r=0\n",

What does a great America look like?\n\n",

None of the things I've read have anything remotely specific to say about what is meant by \"stereotype\", which is an extremely broad term, nor about how the literature gets such impressive results. This seems natural given the activist nature of the articles I've seen discussed, which are geared most of all to pushing what they see as neglected research out into the open against a tide of unfair scepticism, but it's incredibly frustrating, notwithstanding that at least one of the references I've seen to this has been in pseudo-liberal fake science outlet *Quillette*.\n\nWho can help me out? How is \"stereotype\" being used here? What is it that makes such a thing as a stereotype \"accurate\"? Does the literature really back the generality of this claim? For example: lurking in the background of all of this is \"racial\" stereotyping, does the literature *really* demonstrate that racial stereotypes in the workplace are generally accurate (as I've seen implied once, and thankfully only once)? \n\nCheers for your time!",

        "text": "I've been grappling with this thing ever since the \"trigger warning\"-outcries were starting to become a thing a couple years ago. By that I mean not the practice of using TWs per se but its resulting outcry and backlash. For a lot of subject matters, it seems to be a common occurence that someone might say something that *happens* to coincide with some grand public narratives (whether it reflects the \"whiny youngster\"-trope or SJW-craze or, anything really that happens to be \"in vogue\", regardless of viability), and it is picked up by the media and thrown into the great horror show that has become public discourse.\n\nHas anyone written or done research about this kind of thing? What are the factors that determine these processes? I could for sure speculate that the technological complexity of communication leads to such an information glut that any narrative can be supported with rich anecdotal reports. I could also speculate about the market model of mainstream media, which leads to a competitive media environment where conflict-based subject matter results in greater ad revenue and might as well lead to the construction of niche populations. But what determines what sticks? \n\nIs it so that public discourse in effect gets reified in the general population, effectively being \"created\" by the media (or the competitive pressures that they are subordinated to)? An example of this is recent and from my home country, where a prominent politician wore a Native American costume for a party. This lead to a shitstorm in mainstream media, with highly conflict-based material, and a lot of opinion pieces on how we are easily offended and importing an American outrage culture. However, any nuanced debate was completely impossible, and it also served to strengthen that politician's public appeal (it seemed to have been well-planned based on statements from the party). But, since people naturally assume the newspaper to involve debates (and not highly selected material from a news desk), they are almost forced to take sides, and paradoxically, this constructed outrage seems to lead to *actual* outrage, because people can't believe that people are outraged.\n\nSo, does anyone know anything about any work done on what influences public debate/discourse and how it influences us. Any other associations regarding my rambling would also be welcome. I'm not well versed in media studies (got MS in psych).",
