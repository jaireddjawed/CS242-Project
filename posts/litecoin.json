Litecoin was always the underdog in the crypto world, overshadowed by the big and powerful Bitcoin. But Litecoin had a secret weapon - its sense of humor.\n\nOne day, Litecoin was hanging out with Bitcoin and some of the other cryptocurrencies, discussing the future of their world. Bitcoin, as usual, was boasting about how he was the king of the crypto world and how no one could ever take his throne.\n\nBut Litecoin, with a twinkle in its virtual eye, said, \"I may not be the king, but at least I'm not the 'weight' of the crypto world.\"\n\nBitcoin and the others didn't get the joke, but Litecoin just chuckled to itself, knowing that it had made at least one person (itself) laugh.\n\nFrom that day on, Litecoin decided to embrace its sense of humor and use it to its advantage. Whenever the other cryptocurrencies would take themselves too seriously, Litecoin would make a witty comment or a pun, bringing a little levity to the situation.\n\nAnd you know what? It worked! People started to see Litecoin in a different light, and it wasn't long before it had a following of its own.\n\nSo, the moral of the story is, never underestimate the power of a good pun - it might just make you the top dog (or cat) in the crypto world.\n\nThe end.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674424727.0},{"title":"Is it possible to earn free litecoin online?","author":"naugthy-giraffe-52","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/litecoin\/comments\/10iovwd\/is_it_possible_to_earn_free_litecoin_online\/","text":"I don't want to buy a miner or buy it so I was wondering if it was possible to earn free litecoin on internet?

The store can, for example, ask for payment in USDT (ERC20) and at the same time allow the user to pay in Litecoin. If the user wants to pay in the same coin that the store wants to receive, Trocador just displays the store address, so we don't profit from it, but we send the e-mail to the store when the transaction is created.\n\nAnother cool thing is that projects can suddenly start accepting any cryptocurrency, even if they just have a Litecoin wallet. In my honest opinion, the future will be like this: currencies will be competing with each other and it's not up to us to force users or stores to accept one or another currency. All we need to do is allow both buyers and sellers to use their own prefered form of money.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1673312838.0},{"title":"Crypto Token Litecoin Bucks FTX Fallout With 68% Surge","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2023-01-09\/crypto-token-litecoin-bucks-ftx-fallout-with-68-surge-chart","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1673282608.0},{"title":"Litecoin's MWEB - Mimble Wimble Extension Blocks","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/n3giboWvnro","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673288029.0},{"title":"How I sleep when I own litecoin","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/43k69jfzgzaa1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1673237105.0},{"title":"Litecoin: Light on Its Feet and Heavy on Potential","author":"FortniteFiona","url":"https:\/\/plebzy.com\/litecoin-light-on-its-feet-and-heavy-on-potential\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1673219443.0},{"title":"Litecoin Is Digital Money","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/www.lookintolitecoin.com\/post\/litecoin-is-digital-money","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1673199956.0},{"title":"Litecoin Warrior - found on Artstation","author":"losh11","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/nmb8dd9h6taa1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1673178958.0},{"title":"What is Litecoin Halving?

Both Bitcoin and Litecoin are decentralized cryptocurrencies that use blockchain technology to enable secure and fast peer-to-peer transactions. However, there are some differences between the two that may make one more appealing than the other to some users.\n\nOne key difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin is the speed of transactions. Litecoin is designed to generate blocks and confirm transactions more quickly than Bitcoin, which means that Litecoin transactions are typically faster and can be processed more efficiently. This can make Litecoin more appealing to users who value speed and efficiency in their transactions.\n\nAnother difference between the two cryptocurrencies is the mining process. Litecoin uses a different mining algorithm than Bitcoin, which is designed to be more efficient and require less computing power. This can make Litecoin more accessible to individual miners and can help to decentralize the network.\n\nUltimately, whether Litecoin is better than Bitcoin will depend on individual preferences and priorities. Some users may prefer the faster transaction speeds and more accessible mining process of Litecoin, while others may prefer the more established and well-known Bitcoin network.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670538704.0},{"title":"Mimblewimble Progress Update Thread - November","author":"CBDoctor","url":"https:\/\/litecointalk.io\/t\/mweb-progress-update-thread-2\/53072\/16","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670496989.0},{"title":"Litecoin now does 27% of all payments on BitPay. 66% of Bitcoin's share.","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/qu6hgvrj7k4a1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670455281.0},{"title":"What about mweb support so far?","author":"frunf1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/litecoin\/comments\/zfs89u\/what_about_mweb_support_so_far\/","text":"I used the search here but could not get a decent answer so....It has been many months now since the start of the mweb support.\nBut still it is almost nowhere possible to use the mweb transactions or addresses.\nWhat is the current status?

I feel like we should fork or something (If possible) to another algorithm to be ASIC resistant. It seems like Litecoin will be just as clunky as Bitcoin before long if it gathers enough steam, and mining will be so specialized the normal folk will be unable to join. Surely we would be better with CPU only mining (I don't know the technicals). This way literally everyone could be involved and its unlikely it would ever become centralized?   \nOr do you think we are on the right track and ASIC mining is the way to go? I like the idea one day Litecoin would be a main currency (Maybe I'm dreaming) and I know we have side chains to assist with scalability but they always feel half adopted and a bit mystical, maybe they need time.

I would only need to send it to Microsoft.\n\nWell it sounded good to me, but I do love a bashing on the internet so what do you think.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1664948417.0},{"title":"Safer and smarter MWEB usage","author":"qprimed","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/litecoin\/comments\/xvo3bs\/safer_and_smarter_mweb_usage\/","text":"I have been watching MWEB stats on [https:\/\/www.mwebexplorer.com\/](https:\/\/www.mwebexplorer.com\/) (a wonderful site BTW; support it if you are able) and wanted to make a few observations...\n\n1) MWEB transactions are low frequency (but growing - increased tx frequency is important!)\n\n2) There are occasional high value movements in and out of MWEB - awesome, confidence in MWEB is building!\n\nand a few comments...\n\n1) Use Tor whenever possible to help break potential associations between your node's IP address and your transactions - this, IMHO, is the number 1 safety precaution for already seasoned Litecoin users to help maintain privacy while using MWEB.\n\n2) Once your coins are in MWEB, move them around a bit.  Send them to yourself using another MWEB address (or an entirely separate MWEB enabled wallet).  Generate additional, small MWEB to MWEB traffic to help yourself and everyone else using MWEB.  LTC transaction fees are insanely low, so take advantage of it to help strengthen MWEB and the network as a whole while MWEB boostraps.  Miners will also appreciate even a minuscule bump in tx fee revenue.\n\n3) Trickle your coins in and out of MWEB - right now, large value pegin\/pegout transactions stand out - its likely much better to generate many small transactions to more effectively obfuscate interactions between the main chain and MWEB through the pegin\/pegout process.\n\n4) Stay on MWEB as much as possible.  USE IT... FOR EVERYTHING (if you can).  User experience and adoption will improve considerably when mobile wallet MWEB support finally drops but, in the meantime, offer the option of an MWEB address to receive payments at every opportunity.  **We must normalize the use of MWEB**.  I am hoping that 12 months from now the majority of day to day cash-like payments will essentially mean MWEB to MWEB transactions in everyone's minds - lets see if we can get there.\n\nMWEB is amazing tech that helps to set Litecoin apart from every other major coin (near universal LTC acceptance, ultra high liquidity, MWEB fungibility, MWEB privacy, etc, etc, etc).  Lets do smart things with MWEB that protect ourselves and everyone else as we grow it.\n\nWould love to hear everyone's thoughts.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1664911393.0},{"title":"Mcdonald's In Switzerland Could Easily Accept Litecoin As Payment In Addition To Bitcoin","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/www.lookintolitecoin.com\/post\/mcdonald-s-in-switzerland-could-easily-accept-litecoin-as-payment-in-addition-to-bitcoin","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1664885409.0},{"title":"A New Coinbase Documentary Will Be Released On October 7th","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/www.lookintolitecoin.com\/post\/a-new-coinbase-documentary-will-be-released-on-october-7th","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1664909504.0},{"title":"What is Fungibility and Why is it Important for Litecoin?","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/www.lookintolitecoin.com\/post\/what-is-fungibility-and-why-is-it-important-for-litecoin","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1664852009.0},{"title":"Redemption","author":"thecryptos","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/anynpcgbxir91.png","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1664773678.0},{"title":"Litecoin is the perfect complement to Bitcoin Charlie is the perfect complement to Satoshi #Litecoin #Bitcoin #LTC #BTC","author":"litecoin-master","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/3payg2cs0fr91.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1664726409.0},{"title":"MWEB is now live on TxStreet!","author":"txstreet","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/txstreetCom\/status\/1576693955911356416","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1664749036.0},{"title":"Application-based layer 2 services","author":"CryptoLoverLady","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/litecoin\/comments\/xtog82\/applicationbased_layer_2_services\/","text":"Hey there:)\n\nI would love some help please :).. \n\n1. what are the area of services that layer 2 is the best solution for?\n2. what popular projects\/applications exist for layer 2 nowadays?\n3. where can I find more dept knowledge on layer 2 solutions & use cases? \n\nThanks for the help !","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1664716221.0},{"title":"Is Litecoin Scarce If It Wasn't First?

Current [Litecoin Price Prediction](https:\/\/blog.coindcx.com\/price-predictions\/ltc-price-2022-2023-2024-2025\/) estimate that the price will soar in the future. So, understanding the token\u2019s history and benefits becomes essential.\n\n**History**\n\nEven before the 2022 crypto market crash, Litecoin braved various other odds after its inception. Despite failing to half like BTC, the token captured the confidence of the market to rise to $255.79 in 2021. However, currently, the token stands at an 80% lower rate.\n\nNonetheless, the resiliency of crypto is intact and will prove fruitful in the future.\n\n**Operational Benefits**\n\nOn top of being a jumping-off point for other currencies, the basic abilities of Litecoin are more compared to its competitors. The transactions using crypto are four times more quickly processed at a cheaper service fee than BTC. The token is also more secure and transparent with its features of protection from viruses and trojan horses.\n\n**Higher Hard-Cap**\n\nWith 84 million LTC, the supply of Litecoin is significantly more than Bitcoin, making the token one of the most in-demand crypto. To top it off, the block creation with the token is of two and a half minutes duration, while BTC takes ten minutes. Besides, the network outreach of the LTC community across all social media platforms has also made it an excellent 'moat.'\n\n**Technologically Advanced**\n\nDespite being a fork crypto of BTC, Litecoin has incorporated tremendous technological changes in its code. With the Scrypt hash function, it is more adaptable to be used as a day-to-day currency. Instead of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICS), the token employs more memory usage to make the network more accessible.\n\nConsidering all these aspects, Litecoin seems like a decent investment opportunity even during the bear market. However, it'd be best to err on caution by placing it in a portfolio with a long-term strategy.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1660722769.0},{"title":"The Litecoin Foundation presents the 3rd annual Litecoin Summit in Las Vegas, for two days of networking and discussions around industry developments, technical innovations, and public policy.

By then the bear market should be over, most retail in smaller tokens will be shaken and will be looking for stability- an actual limited coin on its own blockchain.

In RTL release 0.10.2 the RTL devs decided to put on their toxic Bitcoin maximalist ass-hats and add a specific check of the LND backend on init.  If the underlying chain was anything other than \"bitcoin\", RTL would throw up a mocking message and basically tell you to screw off -  all of this with no prior warning to users who might find themselves locked out of their LN funds.  Needless to say, LTC is fully supported on Lightning and this just seemed capricious to the point of malice by the RTL devs.  RTL and LND-Admin are two reasonable  LN management consoles and it was a pity to lose one of them.  Hopefully this recent, unfuqd fork will ease some of the pain.\n\nedit: fixed wording","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1658018122.0},{"title":"How do you make litecoin brainwallets in python?","author":"hodleeeee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/litecoin\/comments\/w0udvq\/how_do_you_make_litecoin_brainwallets_in_python\/","text":"I'm working on a project for fun and practice and can't figure out how to make them.
