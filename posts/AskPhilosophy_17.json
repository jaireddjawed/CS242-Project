That is what I am, it is the foundation of my life. \n\nThe question I’m asking is, how sure can I be that the truth is that which seems most obvious (obvious being what I instinctively believe: yes I am me)? How sure can I be that I’m not just a new consciousness who thinks they’re ‘me’ because they’ve got a plethora of memories to give them that illusion. \n\nI think it’s clear we are not our memories. In fact the way I see it, is that memories have no significance assessing the nature of consciousness at all, or at least very little. Memories are only as significant as any other thought. They are a thought about what’s been previously experienced, there’s nothing separating them from any other thought, because a thought is a thought. That could be nonsense but my main point is that memories and consciousness are entirely independent of one another.\n\nIf we assume that’s the truth, that they’re independent entities, then it simply follows that you can interchange them. To use an analogy, your consciousness is like the computer and your memories are like a memory stick. The computer that these memories were in yesterday could have been shut down. \n\nI know that this question is perhaps just asking what consciousness is, and we don’t have a satisfactory answer for that, but It’d be good to know of any philosophy around this topic.",

        "text": "On one hand, we're all part of systems larger than ourselves, and are continuous with the universe, but that's not the precise focus of my question. The specific philosophical questions are bold.\n\nTo premise: does anyone else feel like they are a collection of agents, often with wildly diverging interests, and that there isn't really any \"self\"?\n\n*To clarify two things: The first - I am not describing this condition with the implication that I'm mentally ill. I previously majored in behavioral economics/psychology and am completing my degree in cognitive science, and don't have any symptoms associated with dissociative disorder. The second - I'm politically pro-individualism, partially because I think that individualist societies are actually more collectivist than collectivist societies, given the former rely on emergence and the latter are often controlled, somewhat ironically, by a small group of individuals.*\n\nWith that out of the way, and I'll continue operating under the premise that \"I'm\" not the only one who feels this way. This is conjecture, but an educated guess on the basis of the fact that I've talked to a number of other people who feel more or less the same.\n\nSo what I'm curious about is:\n\n- Why do we pretend to be individuals?\n    - Is it simply property of sociocultural evolution that happens to be adaptive? \n    - Is it a psychological defense mechanism that allows people to feel in control?\n\nSomewhat ironically, I'm articulating this post with the word \"I\", the very concept I am arguing against. This conflict suggests another potential answer - namely that the notion of \"I\" did not exist before language, but because it is a useful concept (and highly adaptive in the context of social group organization) that we collectively adopted the word ~100k years ago for convenience, and over time the use of the word *created* our sense of self; shifting from a convenience to a notion of independence from the universe around us. \n\nOf course, it seems like animals have a sense of self, which, if true, might disprove the linguistic theory, but we can't actually know this for self-evident reasons. It is possible that animals experience a continuous stream of somatosensory qualia, and all but guaranteed they have an internal model of reality, but perhaps - have no notion of \"self\" in the way we do. This wouldn't invalidate non-human suffering of course...\n\nIntuitively I imagine this proposition is false for other hominids, but probably true for animals with less complex nervous systems. This could just be a my own bias as a human.\n\nAnyways, very stream of consciousness. Thoughts?",

        "text": "The concept of family has become increasingly malleable in the past few years. Between the concept of chosen family, an increasing number of younger people cutting off family members, and general skepticism towards the idea of the nuclear family, the idea that one's family is something self-determined is becoming more and more popular. Not to mention much older institutions like marriage, adoption, or disowning that expand or contract what one considers family to beyond genetics. \n\nTo be clear, I think this is pretty unabashedly a good thing. I myself no longer really consider my parents or aunts/uncles/grandparents family, because it is no longer safe for me to be around them. Not to mention the discrimination that e.g. adopted children can face. \n\nMy question is - if family is something chosen, what exactly is defined by? Is \"family\" really a meaningful concept if it's chosen? What separates a familial relationship from other close, supportive bonds?\n\nI'm aware this is a pretty unusual question for philosophy, but I think it could be interesting to examine from a moral/social/political philosophy position.",

Despite this though, there always will exist a disconnect between the audience and the story in any traditional media of this type. You can watch characters struggle against their lack of control and autonomy in a  story, and that's compelling in its own right, but only because we understand this conflict as a personification on some level of our own battles. Video games are an extremely immersive form of media, but are generally not used for serious storytelling. With some notable examples like Pathologic 2 and Disco Elysium, most games don't take an interest in philosophy. I'm a game developer myself, and I think that there is untapped potential within this medium. **Right now, I'm working on an immersive narrative that puts the player in a  personal and visceral scenario based on existentialist philosophy. Where one can confront, explore, and triumph against existential horror and human morality.** I'd like to share it with you all.\n\nThe game is called ***Yuma Will Burn***\\-\n\n***Yuma Will Burn*** *is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*\n\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma\\_Will\\_Burn/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma_Will_Burn/)\n\nAs a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though,  because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and disempowering narrative experience and the unbridled passion this audience for them has.\n\nI encourage you to check out and wishlist the game with the link above.

        "text": "In Dennett's book Consciousness Explained, he explains two possible ways memories can be incorrect. From Wikipedia:\n\n In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's [*Nineteen Eighty-Four*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four), where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin)'s [show trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_trial), where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation. \n\n Both theories require us to cleanly divide a sequence of perceptions and reactions into before and after the instant that they reach the seat of consciousness, but he denies that there is any such moment, as it would lead to infinite regress. Instead, he asserts that there is no privileged place in the brain where consciousness happens. \n\nThis I understand just fine, but it seems like the MDM is still claiming that there's a specific time at which something becomes conscious, which makes it unclear to me how the distinction between the two types of memory revisions is rendered nonsensical on smaller timescales. I also have difficulty understanding how his Fame in the Brain explanation could be accurate, since there's clearly no single instant in time at which someone becomes famous, but it still seems like there must be a particular point at which something becomes conscious. I've always struggled to wrap my head around this topic. Thanks for your time.",

        "text": " Hello, \n\nI’m a young guy trying to figure out how to frame life for myself. I’ve been trying to get acquainted with philosophy. Summaries first, podcasts after that, and I started recently reading Aristotle’s Ethics. \n\nThis my interpretation of the information I’ve found in relation to a follow up question. Aristotle is diametrically opposed to Plato. Plato believed that there was a form of good in a higher realm towards which we have to move. Aristotle however believes that that is bs, that thinking about metaphysics is bs, etc. He jumps straight to principles. My inquiry is that there is a huge void between consciousness and principles that is left unaccounted for. When life gets tough or someone requires of you to give explanations for why you believe what you believe, how do you frame that jump? What is left in the void? What is being skipped and why? How can I draw a diagram of a beliefs system that jumps straight to principles? How are those principles chosen? \n\nThese questions are eating at me, and I haven’t found any good answers for them. A philosopher that gave a talk at my university literally told me “you can believe in God”. I’m a “Verify don’t trust” type of guy so tnx but no tnx. I thought I might find someone here who can refer me to a book or an author or a novel or something that could be useful for creating a sound framework.",

Quite a few faculty members have retired or have stopped teaching and advising students, including the ones I hope to work with, even though the department still lists their names on the website. The courses offered by the department are rather limited in terms of areas, and I barely have the chance to study what I'm interested in.\n2. Discriminatory comments were constantly made in the department, and the classroom experience has been toxic. Inappropriate comments were made by faculty too. Discrimination and unequal treatment torment me mentally.\n\nI've submitted my transfer application to a few schools (very few) this year, but since the decision to transfer was made very late, and I didn't have enough time to prepare for the applications, I don't think I have much chance of succeeding. For those who have experience transferring programs, do you think it's worth it to try again?\n\nI don't think I could tolerate the toxic environment in my current program any longer. If I take one year off and reapply to other programs, would this seem like a red flag?\n\nAnd for those who have quitted phd programs, what are you currently doing, and do you think it's a good choice? I'm curious to hear what are some possible career opportunities.",

What I'm getting is that he's calling for an attunement to something primordial that is of a \"higher\" (or lower, depending on how you look at it) engagement with the human experience than what Confucius outlines by Humanity and Responsibility.

And are there satisfactory answers to the dilemma for for these?\n\nThe original dilemma: is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?\n\nVirtue ethics: are virtues inherently good because they are virtuous, or are they virtuous because they are inherently good?\n\nDeontology: are universal laws inherently good because they are universal, or are they universal laws because they are inherently good?\n\nConsequentialism: are desirable outcomes inherently good because they are desirable, or are they desirable outcomes because they are inherently good?\n\nThus, do these systems of normative ethics not fall into the same trap as Euthyphro? Euthyphro's theory does not give us the very nature of the pious, but at most a quality of the pious. Similarly, these systems seemingly do not give us the very nature of goodness, but at most a quality of goodness.",

But why?  Because the majority of humans have agreed that a ball is round. \nFurther definition of the ball will depend on which ball it is, size, type, color etc.\nThese things will be relative too the person who defines the ball, and what knowledge they have on those things to be defined.  Is a handball small or large? In relation to a golf ball it will be large, while to a soccer ball it will be small.\nFurthermore, does a ball have to be able to bounce?\nDoes it have to have air in it?  Why is a golf ball a ball, while a marble is a cool?  There's probably own aspects of this, but who has decided that these aspects are correct?  This is where I believe the word \"common understanding\" comes from in.  And that this must be separated from \"genuine common understanding\".  For a true shared understanding to occur, it must involve a completely new object, one that no one knows what it is, and at least two people.\nFirst human set to experience what we call a ball,\nwon't make a word for it, because why should he when no one else knows what this is?\nBut then another person comes to see the same unknown object.  He doesn't know what this is either, so they create a word for this object, so that when they talk about it, they both can understand what they mean.  They have a real common understanding of what a ball is.  And further, these can then explain to other people what this object is and so on, so the rest of man can have an common understanding of the ball.\n\nI'm not really trying to make a point here, but this is a subject I find really interesting and I want to learn more about, but I don't know what to \"google\" or what to look for. Who are the people who know a lot about this topic and where can I read more about it?  and of course, if there are any redditors out there who are sitting on a lot of information on this topic, please feel free to pass on the knowledge to me.\n\nIf I can try to spesify more what I am talking about, it's things like \"true meaning of defining something/someone\", the difference between \"to know\" and \"to truely know\", \"how to truely know the meaning of understanding\".\n\nAnd just to be clear, I am not sure of my case in absolutely anything I write, I only write what I think based on my little knowledge of this.\n\nAnd also please help to to pick out the right flair to this theme :)\n\nPlease help a confused, curios girl.",

        "text": "I took a course in critical thinking at my university last year and then two more from YouTube after that, this got me interested in Rationality and how to use it in my life. I proceeded to read and engage with Graham Priest's 'Logic: A Very Short Introduction' to help me along. I'll be moving on to 'Rationality' by Steven Pinker as soon as I'm able to buy the hard copy. All of the above is to say that I have dipped my pinky in most of the normative models of rationality; Logic, Bayes' Theorem and Probability, Decision Theory etc. This has vastly changed the way I think about a lot of things, for the better. From how I evaluate arguments to how I create my own, and to how I interact with the world in general.\n\nWhat I'm having difficulty with is actually internalizing this knowledge. I find myself acting mostly in default throughout my daily life as I've always done. What punctuates this default state is when I need to motivate for something or write down persuasive text - it's only then that I can tap into the models of rationality that I've learnt. I want to incorporate rationality more into my life; into the little tasks that are automated (against by attempts at being mindful) by my brain as well, so that it shows in my behaviour over stretches of time that I've actually learnt something I find valuable. Please advise, and thank you.",

I my opinion when people talk of a \"soul\" what they really do allude to is conciousness. You will hear things like \"watching a sunset is good for the soul\", which in my opinion transfers directly to it is good for your consciousness. Now obviously lots of religions have venerated the soul but has any religion or philosophy done so with conciousness directly?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10v2xhv/morality_as_minimising_interference_between_goals/",
        "text": "**Background:** In debates about agency, free will, and responsibility, I often reason from the perspective that individual moral responsibility is inherently flawed. That is, the results of one's actions cannot rightly or rationally be attributed to, and thus owned by, the individual. The logic is basically:\n\n1) individual genetics, upbringing, and luck are beyond a person's control;\n2) a person cannot be expected to act on experience and understanding not present;\n3) an individual, unlike the group, often does not have the health and resources to correct the situation efficiently or effectively; punishment places the burden of correction on the very member already most lacking in resources and faculties; ironically, those with _more_ resources tend to get _less_ punishment, despite having more resources for self-correction.\n\nThe basic conclusion is that morality _ought,_ in the interest of precision and effectiveness, to focus on fixing or managing root causes, rather than placing praise or blame on the individual. The idea is to forego the notion of independent or free agency, instead investigating the causal phenomena behind the desired or undesired outcome.\n\nAn assertion which seems to come up fairly often is that without recognising individual, _independent_ agency, that there can be no morality, or otherwise that morality would then make no sense. One specific argument is that without a person to do wrong or to be attributed for the action, there can be no wrongdoing.\n\n# Proposal\n\nIn trying to support my position that morality does _not_ require independent agency, I came up with the idea that **morality is about trying to minimise interference between goals within a system, including across time.** The logic is:\n\n1) morality is, in practice, about avoiding actions that cause harm;\n2) harm is interference with will or objective;\n3) objectives can exist as mere tendencies or procedural scripts;\n4) plenty of things, including plants, computers, and social instruments can have tendencies and procedures;\n5) therefore morality can exist _without_ personal responsibility and _without_ free will.\n\n# Argument\n\nAn argument that came up against this stance is that if people or goals are causally connected, then individual or independent goals cannot exist; and therefore there can be no interference between goals. My basic counterargument thus far is:\n\n1) the causal connection, or shared origin, between goals within a system does not preclude the existence of interference;\n2) nor does it preclude the existence of additional aims related to minimising interference;\n3) therefore, the aim of minimising interference can exist simultaneous to goals that might otherwise have interfered more significantly.\n\n# Questions\n\n* Is the above _proposal_ logically valid?\n* Are its premises sound?\n* How about the _argument_ and its counter?\n* Who argues for or against a similar proposal?",

How does the root of the PSR- there is \"no object without a subject\" (and consequently \"no subject without an object\") establish that representations/appearances apart from my own body have a subjective side (like my own body does, as will)?    If there is no object without a subject, then the existence of a tree, a table, a chair, etc. etc., requires a perceiving subject, but how does then entail that representations/appearances like a tree, table, chair, etc. also has an inner, subjective side??\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I have gone through many phases in my life, religiously/philosophically speaking. I started my life without a real choice, being cattle-herded into Catholicism, which actively discouraged and shamed challenging the doctrine. In my youth, I think I was SCARED into believing there was a god, rather than arriving at that conclusion through my own abilities of reason. This led to my angsty teen atheist years, when I swore up and down not only that there wasn’t a god, but all organized religion was farcical and self-contradictory. This slowly transitioned into my agnostic phase, when I posited that the existence of a god is simply unknowable. However, none of these conclusions, deep down, ever sat right with me. I never felt strongly in any of these convictions, and for years I couldn’t put my finger on why. But now, twenty-six years into life, I think I’ve figured it out: all of these methods of thinking purport to KNOW something with certainty. Organized religions assert that the presence of a higher power is KNOWN and is the reason for this earthly toil we call life in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Atheists just KNOW god is an impossibility, despite eternal confinement to this world and it’s physical entrapments. Agnostics, while perhaps superficially ignorant, seem to KNOW that gaining these answers is impossible, that finding evidence for a higher power will forever be beyond our grasp, oblivious to the constraints of our own mortality and the undiscovered universes and worlds that lie light years away. My question is why are we, as humans, so averse to ignorance?  Was it not Socrates who said, “the only true wisdom is knowing you know nothing?”",

Not that this answers anything but  I think that people tend to act as if the two are the same. If a kid lost their toy, their parents would buy the exact toy again. If you lost your water bottle, you buy a new one. Inanimate objects have no agency or consciousness so I feel that they’re too different to the human examples I see about clones.",

        "text": " I am hoping someone can help me think through this problem.\n\n&gt;Assumption: every cause has a logical effect.\n\nLet's suppose you build a supercomputer that is able to predict the future state of the universe 5 minutes from now.\n\nEvery time you run that program, you will receive new information that you did not have before. Now that you are privy to this insight of the future, this is an entirely new input you will react to.\n\nIf the machine depicts you making coffee 5 minutes from now, you now can react to this new knowledge, which may mean you avoid making coffee out of pure spite or curiosity. This invalidates the prediction of the machine. This also seems to suggest you would never be able to prove that the machine is capable of accurately predicting the future.\n\nThe only way to accurately predict the future state of the universe is to know all logical reactions to every insight of the future, in advance. You would need to calculate every effect of calculating the future, before you calculate the future. Worded one more time in a different way, you would need to have knowledge of every possible future before you have knowledge of any future. This creates an infinite regression of predicting the future, and is therefore a total impossibility.\n\nHowever, we know it is possible to predict aspects of the future state of the universe with certainty. Knowledge of minor future events does not invalidate our predictions. This is science as we know it.\n\nCould it be that there is an inherent limit to our knowledge in this way, that at some threshold of our predictive capacity, all predictions start to break down?\n\nThis is where I am perhaps confusing myself, and I'm hoping some more brainpower here can resolve my confusion. Also, is there a term for this apparent paradox?",
