I found out they're nutritious &amp; can be used in a number of ways. \nThere's several blogs that talk about the uses of garlic peels.\n\nMy trick is I put them on a paper plate then microwave them when I'm done peeling. After a minute or two of cooking they should be crispy enough.\nThen I roll up the paper plate to crumble it up &amp; if it's crispy enough you can have it crumble into flakes.\nAnother way is to wrap them in foil then add to the oven when cooking a meal &amp; leave it in for 5-10 minutes to make crispy. \nHopefully I'll find a more efficient way soon.\nI mixed it into thanksgiving stuffing, chili, salsa, &amp; roast so far. Can also make a decent pizza herb.\n\nFor the garlic itself I often will crush them &amp; add them to salsa to make a heart cleansing salsa. The garlic peel flakes can act as a herb &amp; filler for the watery salsa too.",

Sadly, at the end of the video the drops she was suggesting were \"available on her website\" and that immediately put up red flags for me.\n\nWhen I search for mineral drops it's all advertisements, and thebarticles suggest the \"10 best nutrional products\" is also just advertising in my mind.\n\nLastly, the Vitamin/supplement industry is rife with fraud, leading me to believe that most products sold under that label are fake or at the very least \"not as advertised\".  So where can I find credible information regarding nutrients supplements?  Or credible products as well?  I know there are good products out there, but in an age where information has been corrupted/politicized/monetized its extremely hard to know what is authentic and what is phony.\n\nThank you for any help!",
