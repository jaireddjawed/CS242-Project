        "text": "Wrinkled clothing - laundry help please\n\nWe just moved house recently.  Only about 10kms, to the next suburb. \nAt the old house I used my 'custom cycle' button on my washing machine, which uses both cold and hot water,  and the clothing would be slightly warm to the touch after washing. I'd hang out the clothes (under the verandah) and the only things that ever needed ironing were business shirts. Even if I didn't hang the clothes out for a few hours, i.e. washed then at night, hung out next morning - no wrinkle problems at all.   \n\nNew house. Same machine. Both taps turned on to the machine, still using the 'custom' cycle. I open the lid after the cycle finishes and my glasses fog up!! The clothes are steaming HOT. And super wrinkled. Like, clothes that normally don't even wrinkle, are aaaaall wrinkles. And difficult to iron, like I've never bought iron-ease spray before but now I am. I hang them out on line, in direct sunlight at this house - still extremely wrinkled.  \n\nSo I set today's cycle to 'tap cold/cold' wash.  Same thing happened!! Hot!!! Ok so I turned off the hot tap at the wall,  and tried another load. Now, because only one tap is connected, it errors and won't finish the cycle until I turn the tap back on.  So both taps have to be on, and even when I set it to wash in cold, it washes in hot. And I have never EVER had this problem before. I have been washing clothes as a wife/HBIC for 27 years and for the last 10 years I have been washing multiple loads daily. So I'm pretty savvy at this stuff but I feel like I'm missing something. \n\nSo. Is this caused by 'hard water' and if so, what exactly is that and how do I remedy it? Thanks in advance if you can shed any light on the situation.",

People invading your personal space and not respecting boundaries, try this. \n\nSo much of what we think is unchangeable in our life is merely a matter of habit, and what is food if not our biggest \"habit\".\n\nWhat if changing our lives is a matter of changing our food?\n\nI know how cynical we all are here and as I have no \"authority\" to back this up I would like to say, if you are considering arguing with this post about trying something for 1 month to see if life gets better, then maybe this isn't for you.\n\nFor everyone else if you are desperate and looking for the next step in life then please give this a try, there is nothing to lose.\n\nPlease don't run straight to tofu as that has its own stuff going on. Pineapple helps dissolve chicken so that is an option if you already have it in your system.",

Use folders to organize emails: Create folders for different types of emails and move emails into them as needed to keep your inbox clean\n\n2. Set a reminder to follow up on emails using the flag option. You can set a specific date that you need to follow up by. \n\n3. Create rules to automatically categorize emails: Set up rules to automatically categorize emails based on sender, subject, or other criteria, so that you don't have to manually move emails into folders. I even added a specific sound for emails that come from my supervisor so that I don’t miss important items. \n\n4. Use the calendar to schedule your own tasks. For instance on Mondays at 10am I have a 2 hour block where I go over pending tasks. This makes me have a consistent schedule. \n\n5. Use the task feature to keep track of your to-do list and mark items as complete when they are done\n\n6. Use the category option to categorize emails and when you want to find something specific you can search by category \n \n\nHope this can be helpful to someone!",

Did you like the set of new years resolutions you created for yourself? Keep it to yourself! It's yours and yours only, nobody else needs to know about it!\n\nWhen your self-esteem is dictated by how others perceive you and not how you perceive yourself, then you will never actually be happy at your accomplishments- just happy at how others perceive them\n\nExample: \"guys I lost 10 lbs!\" \"Guys I just started going to the gym! Today is the start of my new life and I just wanted to share that with you\" \"guys how do I look? Am I ugly?\" \"Guys I cleaned my room for the first time in months!\"\n\nAll but 1 of these are things you shouldn't need a stranger's validation on. You should be happy enough at your own accomplishments that you don't need some stranger on the internet to pat you on the back- you don't even know these people.\n\n\nYou need to be able to have confidence and self-esteem by your own self, not from strangers on the internet. With this in mind you'll actually be happy at your accomplishments and no longer need random people to make your accomplishments feel valid. If **YOU** think it's an accomplishment, then it's valid!\n\nIf you post them online, then you'll start thinking the ones that don't get as much attention aren't as good of accomplishments, and that's a whole vicious cycle of trying to get the most validation from strangers...

It was going really good, i thought from her side too as she mostly initiated the meet ups. Even the last date we had she said she wish i could've stayed longer. Then, about 4 weeks ago she told me her ex came back unexpectedly and confessed his love for her. She told me lots of details so i don't think she made it up. She said she's really confused and can't continue dating me in this situation and doesn't want to keep me waiting and said i should continue dating too.\n\nThe days after she told me this we both were quite emotional and she called me once crying. We met up 2 more times after that basically being emotional but mostly her comforting me i felt like. I did also make the mistake of sending her 2 long text messages after the breakup, which came across quite needy. I didn't beg or get angry however. At this point she's still not back with her ex and she's taking that decision serious i can tell. The last text she send me was a few days ago when i asked her how things were going. She said she was very busy and that 'she could imagine i was curious about her current situation and thought proces.' So she will give me an update on that, not sure how long that'll take...\n\nI'm super heartbroken i really liked her. I know i shouldn't have any hope. I think the best thing i can do is leave it and work hard on myself? Maybe if i'll ever see her again atleast i'll make a good impression. I regret being too laid back during the dates and not trying harder, even when we were intimate. She for sure didn't see me from my best side which sucks. I could've done more to impress her. We did end on good terms.",
