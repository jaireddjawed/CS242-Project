The gear is driven by a motor and wormdrive gearbox (blue in the images).\n\nMy biggest problem is finding off the shelf keyway shafts with squared ends.\n\nWould a regular keyway on the steel bracket work? I'm mostly concerted about the steel plastically deforming over repeated use, so I thought a square would better distribute torque.\n\nDo you know of a better/more standard way of doing this?",

This is an investor owned utility (IOU), so the focus is on maximizing shareholder value, reducing operation and maintenance and working on capital projects that can pass costs on to the customers.\n\nI'm just so disillusioned by the business model, reducing workers' compensations, bonuses, etc. at the cost of \"being profitable so that we can borrow money for more projects\".  I mean, how is this even feasible.  Like other IOUs, of course this is a monopoly and the squeezing of O&amp;M just feels like IOUs haven't learnt their lesson from the PG&amp;E wildfire event.  I'm just feeling so beat down by the fact that I'm not making people's lives better ... I'm just making more money for the executives and shareholders.  \n\nAlso, like any other large corporations, there's leadership training, continuous improvement training, executive training and bunch of other stuff while actual focus on engineering seems to be at a dead end.  Everyone wants to replace people retiring with world class engineers with critical thinking skills, but you don't just get there without investing in people.  \n\nThe leadership trainings are just us getting in groups and role playing different leadership roles ... no focus on what works and what doesn't.  I just don't understand the continuous improvement training.  During the training, we get to focus on how a pizza shop should improve its business while later on, we need to apply this to multi billion dollar complex projects.  Nobody wants to share lessons learnt anymore.  It's all about shareholders, meeting numbers, and lip service.  People who actually do the engineering are close to retirement and one foot out the door.   \n\nNothing makes sense and I just feel like quitting everything.",

I built my wife some roll out “wardrobes” for our closet to allow for extra storage due to the slanted ceiling.  They work great and accomplished the goal.  \n\nThe issue is, apparently I’m stronger than my wife and she says she can’t pull them out by herself.  I had a track system designed but after testing strictly casters on the carpet I thought it was easy enough.  I could remove the carpet and I’m sure it would roll much easier but that would require re-doing the whole floor and she would likely not go for that.  \n\nMy thought was to mount a 3-4ft full thread steel bar to an electric motor and thread it through some stationary nuts on the wardrobe.  I’m comfortable with hooking it up and what but I want to get away with as little expense as possible while not under powering the motor.  I was thinking either 6V or 12V but didn’t know if using multiple smaller motors attached with worm gears to the nuts instead of the steel bar would allow me to get the same result for less money.  \n\nWould love to know your thoughts.  I would say the pull/push needed is at most 30lbs?",

It works by spinning an inertia disc up to a set speed, with the brake mounted on the end of a shaft (linked by a series of flexible couplings), a clutch is functioned to isolate the brake from the motor before the brake is activated. A torque transducer measures torque and acceleration.\n\n\nWhile I was on holiday, my colleague performed a brake test and one of the couplings failed (one half has rotated about 90 degrees relative to the other). This was the first time the largest inertia disc / fastest speed had been tested. Unfortunately, I don’t have the test data for torque and stop time.\n\n\nThe shafts are pretty small and the available space to mount a DTI instrument is very limited so I’m not confident in the results, but from the measurements I have taken the shaft alignment is near the limit for the coupling (0.2mm lateral, 1 deg angular).\n\n\nI have a feeling it is an alignment issue but want to rule out alternative explanations.. Is there any way the inertia disc could be inducing a peak torque through the coupling before the brake has a chance to slip and relieve the torque? The coupling has a torque rating three times that of the brake. \n\n\nThanks.",

It is going to have to integrate with Cognex Visionpro, robots, ethernet enabled lighting &amp; autofocus lens controllers, and motors. All of these subsystems have or will have a DLL to manipulate and control them, and this will be built within a C# Winforms on .NET Framework\n\nThe biggest challenge of this will be developing a way where you can write a program to run the inspection, as there will have to be a lot of small differences between parts which will require the program to manipulate all the different pieces of hardware in different ways.\n\nMy thought for this was to use scripting, similar to how a CNC runs with G Code. The idea im set on now is using roslyn/c# scripting so that the programs can be written in C#, a known language, and then executed using CSharpScripting. The programs can then be written to directly use all the methods and functions from the DLLs. The problem I anticipate most is managing all the object instances of all the hardware, and moving data back and forth between the c# script and the c# winforms\n\nSo far, I did figure how to execute a basic method against the instance of a class and that works fine.\n\nIs this a reasonable approach to handle this, or is there some other way im missing? Im constrained to using C# .NEt Framework due to the hardware integration. Ive heard of things like lua, but I don't know how id be able to manipulate all the .NET DLLs\n\nThanks in advance.

        "text": "Hello dear community,\n\nI am currently working on a locking bolt which separates two gaps filled with silicone oil from each other or opens to each other to block adjustability.\n\nThe locking bolt can be operated by hand and is pressed out of its guide in the longitudinal axis to a stop in order to release the passage.\n\nNow it is the case that after a longer period of non-actuation of the locking bolt mechanism, the force required to push it out increases sharply.\n\nI would argue that after a while the weight of the locking axle displaces the grease in the guide and the material of the locking bolt and the guide rub against each other. When subsequently pushing out, the grease is distributed evenly again and the mechanism is easier to operate.\n\nMy colleagues talk about a stick slip effect, is that correct?\n\"The stick-slip effect occurs when the static friction is greater than the sliding friction. It describes the unwanted, jerky movement of two solids as they make contact with each other.\"\n\nWhat do you think is the reason for the large increase in release force, can it be described as stick slip effect?\n\nThank you.",

I had always been interested in cars, but I chose Civil because I was undecided about Engineering in general and Civil was the most diverse seeming of the fields. I am a few months away from graduating, now, so a major switch is off the cards. However, my interest in cars is still skyrocketing. I dream about working as an engineer for an automotive company. I just don't know which technical engineering roles to target and how to pivot my experience to fit those roles. \n\nI have tried to highlight my transferrable skills (technical and soft) to recruiters and engineers at a few automotive companies on LinkedIn and haven't had much success. I have nearly 2 years of work experience working in a mechanical/electrical engineering role, working with contractors and AutoCAD extensively. I try to leverage this but often either get ghosted or get told I don't have the relevant degree needed. \n\nMy dream role would be either safety (passive) or the CAE teams, if that helps. I would also be interested in QA! I just want to get involved and don't know how. I always get told to highlight my skills that could easily apply to those fields and I often try to reword my resume to fit that but I can't seem to get any further than rejections from recruiters or ghosting. I've had my resume critiqued by an engineer at an automotive company but I would be open to any resume tips too! \n\nSo, my question is, what are some technical roles I could try to pivot myself into that aren't too particular about the degree I hold?\n\nSorry if this kind of question isn't allowed here. I just really would appreciate any advice.",

She uses a lot of homemade tools to get the job done, but I honestly feel like they’re a waste of materials. One of the pieces that I’d like to help her with is how she polishes her chocolate molds. She has a drill with a bit, which she rubber bands cotton pads, cotton balls and scraps of an old tshirt to. This makes a sort of marshmallow-y attachment on the end which conforms to the shape of the mold. The only thing is she can only use it until it gets too dirty and then she has to swap it out. \n\nI wondered if there was a way to somehow mold some sort of attachable tip for the drill that we could just attach and clean over and over, but I’m not quite sure what it could be made of or what method to make a custom attachment. It would either need to conform to the molds or be the perfect fit into the molds. And she can’t have hard material that might scratch it. I’ve suggested 3D printing for other projects she has, but am unsure how to even approach this one. Would love any ideas you have.",
