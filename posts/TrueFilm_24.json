        "text": "I just rewatched Michael Mann's 1995 classic *Heat* and it seems like I notice something new every time I watch it. This last time something that really stuck out to me is how timeless this movie is. I don't mean it in a cheesy way either. Outside of maybe the boxy television sets, the cars, and the phones/radios, there is really nothing about that movie that dates it to the 1990s. You could have made the same movie today, and you really would not be able to tell. It somehow just makes the 1990s look so much less 90s-ish than most other 90s movies do.\n\nI feel like 90s movies in particular feel very dated. There is just this certain 1990s aesthetic and common tropes that a lot of those movies have (hair curtains, big cell phones and Y2K computers, post Cold War American exceptionalism, early CGI, etc.) Then *Heat* comes on the scene and it's just unlike not only any other movie at its time, but unlike most other movies in general. It's the very essence of noire, and the emphasis on art over just making a heist movie makes it stand out. It somehow makes the 1990s seem a lot more modern than you remember.\n\nI think a lot of what makes it timeless is that the movie spends time on things most other movies do not, especially the other films of its time. The granular attention to detail in the gunfight, the hotel and diner scenes, Michael Mann's very distinctive and exacting style of noire, make the movie so artistic, and really set it apart from the types of movies Hollywood just slaps out there.

Of course, most of my reseaches bring me to Psycho, and, as true as it is the best and most famous shower scene in history, it's surely not the first one. We can see Marlon Brando's character in A Streetcar Named Desire having (or better, being forced to) a shower, although for brief seconds. I can't really remember if It Happened at Night by Capra actually does have a shower scene. I haven't watched more than a couple hundred movies from the 30s/40s/50s, and I was also wondering if the Hays Code or just moral sense of the time prevented this from happening. Finally, I don't remember foreign films from this decades featuring a shower. So, cronologically, which were the first shower scenes in movie history? I'm still stuck believing it's \"Streetcar\" but I have the feeling there are more shower scenes before that. ",

        "text": "Goodfellas has always been one of my favorite movies. I used to watch it repeatedly growing with my friends and family. What I loved about it most was just how fun it is with the stylish filmmaking, humor, and music. But watching it again, I think it is a really fascinating look at immorality. Despite how much fun they are having these characters are truly evil sociopaths. Now this is kind of obvious for a gangster movie but I really think Scorsese does an amazing job of emphasizing the lack of empathy or really any morality in these characters.\n\nFor instance other mob classics like The Godfather, Once Upon a Time in America and The Sopranos portray their characters as monsters in some ways but also people who had some degree of honor and loyalty. Goodfellas is telling it's audience: These are the people that you are looking up to. I think it is really the most realistic mafia movie because it shows these people for what they are without trying to make them more appealing to the viewers.\n\nHowever, it does seem that Pauly and his crew did have some of the noble qualities of the mafia but the new generation with Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy completely burned anything respectable about the to the mob to the ground. On first look it may seem like Henry is not as bad as his counterparts because he wasn't as violent but I actually think he may have been the coldest of them all. He seemed to have the least respect of mob loyalty and deliberately lied and betrayed those who made him who he was. He showed no emotion when his supposed best friend was killed and after ratting out his other friends and father figure all he seemed to care about was that he could no longer live the gangster lifestyle. That is why the ending scene is so brilliant, it shows that's all that ever mattered to Henry.\n\nI think that Goodfellas (as well as the Wolf of Wall Street) shows that this kind of extravagant lifestyle may only come (for people like this) from selling one's soul and letting go of any morality. It's like the line from Citizen Kane \"There's no trick to making a lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money\". Most Scorsese films ultimately focus on feelings of shame or guilt but there is absolutely none of that here.",

        "author": "Alienboy13",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/94gokm/a_counterargument_towards_gr4nd45s_post_on_films/",
        "text": "On a post made by Gr4nd45, he feels that films are no longer being treated as an art to due: Hollywood only caring the business than the art, a lack of originality, an increase of reboots and sequels, adapting comic books, and films playing it safe by not being controversial.  I would like to counterargue his complaints, one by one.\n\nFirst off, I'm noticing a bit of a hypocrisy towards reboots. We'll say that its unnecessary or its ruining our childhood (stupid term by the way), but when its actually good, we'll give it a free pass. The same thing goes with sequels and prequals. If anything, if the reboot sucks, we still have the original, and nothing will change that.  \n\nBusiness- I understand that the art should be more important than the business, but like it or not, there is a business in art. Business is pracially Hollywood's middle name.  Business is what makes the world go around. In the end of the day, Hollywood is a business. No ifs, ands, nor buts about it. \n\nPlaying it safe due to political/social terms- Talking about stuff that won't and will be allow in today's troubled polictical/social times is counterproductive both as filmmakers and film-viewers. One thing that I think Gr4nd45 don't realize is that some filmmakers don't make their films with the sore purpose of creating controversy. If you're are making a film just for that purpose alone, you're doing it wrong. \n\nOriginaity- What was that thing that Jim Jamusrsh said?\n\n  \"Nothing is original. Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic. Authenticity is invaluable; originality is nonexistent. And don’t bother concealing your thievery – celebrate it if you feel like it. In any case, always remember what Jean-Luc Godard said: “It’s not where you take things from – it's where you take them to.\"\n\nThanks Jim. Everything is a copy of something. Its what you do to it that makes it stands out.\n\nI created this post for a few reasons. One- I'm sick and tired of people complaining and whining about the state of film. Whether because of lack of originality or if film lost its meaning. It comes across as whininess and laziness because it shows that the person isn't willing to put in the effort to seek out films outside of the American market or look at the indie film scene. There are filmmakers out there who truly love the art and want to get their voices to be heard. But they're not giving changes from either studio wigs or complainers turning a blind eye to them. And I believe that the latter is the worst. Because like I said, they're turning a blind eye. \n\nSomeone on r/movies who if I could kiss, I would listed great films from the past few years:\n\nThere Will be Blood, Arrival, No Country for Old Men, The Departed, Wolf of Wall Street, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained, The Dark Knight, The Revenant, Gravity, Moonrise Kingdom, The Social Network, Mad Max: Fury Road, The Master, Wind River, Sicario, La La Land, Drive, Birdman, Nightcrawler, Gone Girl, The Grand Budapest Hotel, 12 Years a Slave, Dallas Buyer's Club, Nebraska, Mud, Her, Silver Linings Playbook, Children of Men, A History of Violence, Drive, Interstellar, Whiplash, Coco, Inside Out, Blade Runner 2049, Prisoners..\n\nSecond- I made a post about seeing films as art: [https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7t1sij/seeing\\_films\\_more\\_than\\_just\\_entertainment/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/7t1sij/seeing_films_more_than_just_entertainment/)\n\nIn the post, I said that someone online negatively attack me for seeing film as art by saying: \"Movies are not about ''art'', they're only about entertainment. I'll repeat myself, beyond entertainment movies are of little to no value in real life. Millions and millions of people the world over love watching blockbusters can't be wrong.\"\n\n\"You're just a typical delusional idiot contrarian snob who thinks going against the grain somehow makes you look \"cool\" and ''edgy''. It gives you a sense of purpose, makes you feel better about yourself. People like you are so insecure. Simply pathetic. It must suck to be an annoying depressed condescending asshole like you.\"\n\nI asked folks about seeing film as art and responses I got is something you should check out.\n\nIn conclusion, we as film fans need to better than this. We need to stop being pessimistic about the state of film because last time I check, complaining gets you nowhere in life. Nobody is forcing you watching someone that you consider recycle crap. Instead of complaining it, seek out artfully crated films that remind you on why you love films in the first place.\n\nAnd Gr4nd45, like it or not dude, most folks just see film as entertainment and there's nothing wrong with that. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. If you want to convince someone otherwise, do it a way that's reasonable and sound. Don't condescend, don't look down upon, don't try to make yourself feel like the better man. \n\n Also, this thing about \" WE, as the audience, should be able to change these things.\" \n\nWhat, you want a Fight Club style revolution to happen? No offense, but I think you been watching too many films.  ",

        "text": "What happened? 3 was great, 4 was good, even 5 was still pretty good. But this? This was barely above the absolute dumpster fire that the 2nd one was. There is not one redeeming element of this film that I can think of. The plot was nonsense, the actors seem bored, they couldn’t even get basic technical aspects right as the entire film was drifting in and out of focus and suffering from being severely underexposed with noise artifacts and milky blacks dirtying every frame.\n\nNow about the plot, the writers seem to not understand that adding more plot twists does not make the script more clever. Every other scene the movie says, “Just kidding! That never happened it was something else instead!” Or something will go wrong only to have it revealed that it was the plan the entire time. It’s not interesting; it’s repetitive and boring.\n\nIn previous films, the strength of the IMF has always been how smart they are. Yes, Ethan Hunt is very agile and a skilled fighter, but he wins because he is clever. Not in Fallout. In Fallout he goes straight to the enemy as quickly as he can by car, motorcycle, helicopter or the patented Tom Cruise run and he punches them to save the day. We all know that he’s going to win so there’s never going to be any tension from the question of whether or not he’ll save the day, so in the past the tension has always come from not knowing how he will save the day. When it’s just a fist fight, you know exactly how he’ll win, he’s going to hit harder.\n\nEven with all of those issues it could have at least been mediocre if the actors seemed to care even the smallest amounts. Tom Cruisehas becomes too big for his own good. He needs someone to be able to tell him that he can’t just say every line like a stonewalled badass, he has to emote at least sometimes. Where is the frantic energy he had trying to put together a makeshift defibrillator in 3? Where is the look of genuine fear hanging from the Burj Khalifa? He reacts at most with the same mild concern that you would show when you miss a turn and have to drive an extra block down the road. And Ving Rhames? He recites his abysmal dialogue with the enthusiasm of a high schooler flipping burgers for minimum wage. I could go on but the performances are all so full that even criticizing them is getting boring.\n\nFinally, the film is technically incompetent. The pacing is all over the place. The viewer is jolted from one jumbled action piece to some languid expository dialogue all spattered with inane slow motion shots that I’m assuming are meant to be reflective but are only comically self sincere.\n\nEven the stunts, which were a big selling point of the film, aren’t displayed well. It doesn’t matter if Tom Cruise really did a HALO jump if in post they then poorly rotoscope a low resolution two dimensional image of Paris below him. It doesn’t matter if Tom Cruise learned how to roll a helicopter if it’s framed in such a disorienting manner that the audience can hardly tell. It doesn’t matter if making the film was challenging and dangerous, if it’s a terrible movie.",

        "text": "First post can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/92fu74/the_origins_of_new_french_extremity/?st=JKEKW2NI&amp;sh=d9c157d1)\n\nYou guys enjoyed my introduction to the Origins Of New French Extremity, so I thought I’d share the next instalment, about the 2002 film In My Skin, directed by Marina De Van.\n\nLast week I talked briefly about the genesis and characteristics of films that have been created in the spirit of New French Extremism. The movement is not restricted specifically to the horror genre, however the distinguished attention that Extremist films pay to the broadly defined concept of body often produces material that balances on the verge of body horror or cine du corpse which, as Tim Palmer noted, ‘conveys forcibly its provocative materials, fraught on-screen treatments of the body that evoke new levels of perceptual engagement from the viewer’ (Palmer, 2007:180). De Van’s film invites - or even demands - to explore ‘cinema’s tactility’ and appreciate it ‘as an intimate experience and of our relationship with cinema as a close connection, rather than a distant experience of observation’. (Barker, 2009, 2).\n\nIn My Skin tells the story of a successful young woman, Esther, who becomes obsessed with literally exploring her leg injury. As she fails to notice the pain after what appears to be an inconsequential accident at a party, she starts touching, irritating and eventually digging deeper and deeper into her flesh. The mixture of sadomasochistic pleasure and guilt consequently prevents Esther to carry on with her love and work life. At first glance, the unexceptional heroine appears to be in a rewarding moment of her life with a great job in a company that specialises in the customer surveys. Esther is hard working, professional and striving for the promotion that will bring her financial security as she is just about to move in with her boyfriend. Soon, the other side of Esther comes out, her bodily, therefore animal-like side as she gets caught up in maniacal acts of self-destruction. \n\nThe film undoubtedly seeks to be approached through its body. Yet, there is more than just the cinematic body that needs to be discussed in case of In My Skin. The film can regraded as a national body, with Esther’s - and de Van’s - body resembling France. It emphasises France’s deeply rooted, unconcluded traumas and demons reaching as far back as it’s colonial past. Additionally, she is the body of the everyman at the dawn of the new millennium acting as a catalyst of his anxieties and diseases.\n\nFirst, I’ll elaborate on the body of the film and simultaneously, on the embodied spectatorship it provides. Gilian Deleuze described film as a ‘turning crystal’ which, as he explained, \n\n‘Has two definite sides which are not be confused. For the confusion of the real and the imaginary is a simple error of fact, and does not affect their discernibility: the confusion is produced solely in someone’s head. But indiscernibility constitutes an objective illusion, it does not suppress the distinction between the two sides, but makes it unattributable, each side taking the other’s role in relation which me must describe as reciprocal presupposition or reversability’ (Barker, 2009:7).\n\nI apologise for the length and density of the above quote but I find the notion of crystal-image crucial in order to approach tactility and Deleuze, known for his poetic but complicated style, is especially difficult to paraphrase without losing the essence. The main point the philosopher is calling into question is that quality of cinema that makes us lose ourselves in the film and causes the boundaries between ‘character identification and objective observation’ to collapse. It is important in relation to In My Skin as the experience that film provides is particularly embodied. It constitutes us, the audience, in Esther’s position and forces us to dig a hole into our own flesh.\nThe initial disguise is being replaced by the same uncanny curiosity and pleasure that drives Esther to auto-mutilation. The film leaves us weirdly satisfied as it provokes the body to clear our psyche.   \n\nIn My Skin emphasises its main motif and goal (to uncover what always has been covered) at the very beginning. The film opens with a montage of split-screen still shots of urban landscapes, Ester’s everyday day environment. By juxtaposing Positive and Negative images the film gives away its demand to break the boundaries of ever-worn protection, to take off its skin. It is a forceful invitation that is directed equally towards Esther and the viewer. \n\nIn My Skin doesn’t allow us to look away during most comfortable shots. We are not even able to blink as the film doesn’t cut when Easter cuts off her skin with a knife and eats her own flesh. The camera observes the heroine in continuous, lengthy close ups when she pokes the injury under her bandage and the screen fills up with blood and pus. \n\nIn the most effective and unsettling scene, Esther drinks too much wine which, along with her anxiety, contributes to making her more and more withdrawn from the environment. The numbness manifests itself in her body as the woman hallucinates that her hand literally detaches itself and lies on table disconnected from the rest of her body. The feeling of detachment is embodied by the sound design of the restaurant clutter - laughs, talks, sound of cutlery scratching the plates - intensifies. This scene brings to mind Polanski’s Repulsion (1965), the only other film I can think of that studies the body in such a compelling way, and the close shots of a rotten, skinned rabbit that would accompany the images of Carol’s inner terror. In contrast to Polanski’s heroine, however, the only way for Esther to escape from numbness and detachment is through self-mutilation. The increasing urge to deepen her injury once again is illustrated by the juxtaposition of the vivid close up of food with Esther scratching maniacally her hand. \n\nSubsequently, the act - that sits on the verge of self-cannibalism - that she carries out after the failed business dinner resembles an intimate sexual copulation with herself. It’s the heroine’s way of feeling again, to bring herself back to life. It’s almost as if she has to get into the deepest part of her flesh to come to terms with world and reality around her. Through self-cannibalism and destruction of her body, Esther discovers a special kind of intimate relationship with her own corporeal self and the film shows the poetry and beauty of this unsettling bloody spectacle. As she studies her body, Esther exhibits cannibalistic voyeurism. This is especially emphasised in the final sequence when Esther takes time to observe her body, now transformed with open wounds and tender, naked flesh. The reference to the Deleuzian notion of “flesh” is blatantly clear. Daniela Voss noted that ‘although “meat” and “flesh” are both metaphysical concepts and created under the influence of pictorial art, they are signs of two very different modes of thinking. Deleuze’s metaphysics of becoming calls for resistance toward the intolerable in the present.’ Whereas for Merleau-Ponty, who engaged his work in the investigation of the above concepts, ontology of the flesh presents a comprehensive and conciliatory “Weltanschauung”, a theatre of the visible and the invisible, which puts us at peace with the world and our fellow beings’ (Voss, 2013:1) Both approaches relate to In My Skin with its gripping portrayal of the unstoppable urge to reconnect with the body by detaching from it. To see what we are refused by nature, to see the most deeply hidden secret…the flesh.\n\nAside from observing her body, Esther wants to be observed. The urge of performing her self-cannibalistic spectacle now demands a witness. Hence, her camera fulfils her desire to both look and be looked at as she’s able to analyse, study and admire the pictures later. They preserve her act of mutilation better than formalin would, although, they don’t bring it back to life. It is dead as her cut skin with the exception of their flattened, one dimensional version in her camera. Similarly, the film preserves not reality but the film’s distorted version of it. Esther’s failed attempt to mummify her own skin, therefore, stands as a powerful allegory for the fragile nature of cinema, inevitably connected to the sense of lack.\n\nThe film’s director, Marina De Van took the desire of total cinematic embodiment to the extreme in the very act of preparation for the shoot as she casted herself as her own protagonist. For a year she was conducting acting exercises in order to convincingly portray Esther’s self detachment, such as buying and wearing uncomfortable shoes or clothes that were too small, walking out of her comfort zone by stylising her hair against her personal preferences, growing her fingernails to uncomfortable lengths. The process, therefore, became a peculiar act of bodily self-examination and analysis. De Van graduated from La Fémis, a prestigious French film school known for its innovative approach to teaching the craft and inspires the students to look for new ways of seeing and speaking to the audience. The school gave the young director a chance to meet François Ozon with whom she created a fruitful relationship collaborating on many productions including 8 Women. Ozon described De Van as his female counterpart and the influence of the prolific provocateur is certainly present in In My Skin, where she fully sacrifices herself for the film.\n\nAs I examined briefly the cinematic body of In My Skin, I am going to move into the national. Although the filmmaker herself refuses broader interpretations, it is useful to look through its references to French history and current socio-political landscape of France. Firstly, it is important to consider the events that took place during World War II. The Nazi German defeat of France is still a sensitive topic, evoking a deeply seeded national guilt. If we look at Esther and her body as a personification of France, the maniacal, obsessive need to dig further into the wound may be seen as a manifestation of this unspoken, demonic shame. In My Skin can be regarded as a statement of urgency for national catharsis that can be only fully experienced through the body because the psyche refuses to face it. \n\nSimilarly, when Esther injures herself for the first time, she is shocked and disgusted at the beginning but that is quickly replaced with voyeuristic curiosity. What is striking though, is that she escapes from the uneasiness caused by her numbness to pain, by calmly going out for a can of coke. A motif that comes back during the final scene. While mutilating her own body, Esther quenches her thirst with a coke and other American soft drinks. It opens the possibility to find references to Americanisation of France as the country escapes from its unresolved issues. The problems of American values such as capitalism and consumerism, and the issue of foreign influence on France are brought up again at the dinner that Esther has with her clients. They discuss the superiority of France over Japan and Italy. Similarly, Esther’s special professional interest in the Middle East echoes the inner tension that France experiences with immigration from this region. In this multicultural context it is useful to also bring up the differences in understanding body language across the countries and nations that have been mentioned by Esther’s clients during the dinner. The promotional images, that were perfectly acceptable in Western culture, have been declined by a Japanese company as they apparently would connote offensive messages.\n\nLastly, there is the universal body of everyday man with anxieties that seem to be even more relatable almost two decades later with the advent of digital media. The problems that Esther experiences are caused by the pressure she puts on herself at work and in her relationship. The detachment and alienation that have haunted Western civilisation and became more intense in the era of omnipresent smartphones and constant streams of information. As Oliver du Bruyn remarks:\n\n‘The beauty of Dans ma peau also lies in the way its tale of violence of social relations in the modern working environment is embedded in the film [and it belongs ] to the filiation of those unclassifiedable directors (from Georges Franju to Roman Polansky), for who deviancy is first and foremost poetic and aesthetic experience. The mutilation, the fragmentation that is the topic of the film affects the form of the film itself’ (Beugnet, 2007: 158).\n\nDe Van’s film suggests that the cure may lie in separating body from soul, an approach that civilisation keeps refusing.\n\nThe bodies I uncovered that are hidden in Marina de Van’s unsettling and gripping film let me only begin to grasp the essence of In My Skin. I consider it one of the most important films of French Extremism, one that explores and embodies the main characteristics of the movement. \n\nIf you guys continue to enjoy this, next week I’ll post again, this time about Martyrs (2008)\n\n[As always, this was taken from an article I posted here, on my site called Filmosophy](https://www.filmosophy.co.uk/paulinas_gore_in_my_skin.html) but there’s very little there that I haven’t already written here, because I love the discussion that happens on this sub. However, I’d love it if you could take a look!\n\n​",

        "text": "Movies always were a form of art. Not only because they contain many other forms of art (music, acting, etc.), but also, because they were a way for creators to relay their vision, their imagination, to the audience.\n\nHowever, there is a huge problem with movies nowadays - they are being treated purely as business, and not an art form. Just look at the movies, that hollywood produces these times:\n\nAll of them are \"safe\" (business sense) - nearly all of them already have a fan base of varying sizes, as they are mostly live-action adaptations of comic books, or books in general, cartoons, even games. And, of course, let's not forget all the sequels, prequels, reboots and similar stuff.\n\nAnd they are \"safe\" not only in this way. Another thing, is that movies today cater to whatever political/social/whatever views are prevailing at the moment. You won't see \"daring\" or \"controversial\" movies today. And every one of them is trying to fulfill political/social quotas, even if they make no sense in the movie's setting.\n\nBut it's not just that. There's this trend with today's movies - hype it up to the highest level of ridiculousness, to make as many people as possible get to watch the movie at least once. Essentially, it is fooling people into wasting money.\n\nI mean - where did originality go? Where did movies, as an art form, go? Movie creators today are not making what they actually are passionate about. No, between the demands of business they interact with, and all the politics and stuff, movie creators are essentially forced into making the same bland, boring, unoriginal, \"safe\" garbage.\n\nAnd the worst thing about this is that WE, as the audience, should be able to change these things. And yet, seemingly, most of the audience don't consider movies to be a form of art, either. Rather, just a place to eat popcorn at...",

I just finished watching Grave of the Fireflies and from the way reddit puts it, it is the saddest film you will never want to watch again. When I watched it I felt tons of emotions sure, but I never found myself crying which is something I do more then i liked to admit. So I was just wondering what could of caused me to not feel the way I thought I was supposed to. Im not sure if it was over hyped and I was expecting a gut wrenching journey where every scene is sadder than the last. Or was it I figured out the girl was going to die and I had been bracing myself for it so it had little impact. Or was it that I am spoiled with movies and television now that I am better equipped than most people who watched that movie young. Or am I just a sociopath. I recently watched the film In This Corner of the World which is similar to the Grave of the Fireflies and felt more emotions watching that then fireflies.  Sorry if this isn’t an acceptable post or what not, but I was just curious as to other people’s opinions on the film.",

        "text": "I'm seventeen years old and i am an aspiring movie buff. I love everything about cinema, for me it's not only a form of entertainment, but a hobby. I want to watch, analyze and critizise movies from different eras, countries, genres, waves, and different objective qualities.\n\nBut whenever i come to this subreddit i can't help feeling stupid and ignorant due to lack of knowledge about film compares to yours. I've seen a bit over 500 movies in my life, and i feel absolutely inferior when i come to some of the discussions in this subreddit. \n\nSadly, i don't have much time to watch movies because of school. Currently i'm on a summer break and i watch about 2 films a day and still my family thinks it's a waste of time and urges me to do something else.\n\nSo my question for you is how much time did it take you to notice that you have an above average film knowledge? When and how did you get interested in movies? How do you find balance in watching hollywood blockbusters and independent foreign movies? How many films do you see montly and how many have you seen in your life so far?\n\nEdit: i see many of you saying that analysing and reading about film is just as, if not more, important as the amount of movies you watched, to which i absolutely agree.\n\nUsually, as i am seeing the movie, i try to notice and evaluate different elements of it (e.g. charachter development, cinematography, acting, editing), and to decide which aspects of the movie i liked or didn't like, and only after that i read some critic and audience reviews (because i want to develop critical thinking myself), watch video essays, and if it is (i don't watch only classics and 'true'films) important, read about why is that.\n\nI also quite enjoyed Crash Course Cinema History series, and i watch Cinefix, Every Frame a Painting and Nerdwriter1 videos.\nIf you know any other YT channels, books or movies about cinema and its history, and some good movie critics (i can only name Roger Ebert, the other reviews i read i choose randomly), please do.\n\nI do have a Letterboxd account because it helps me a lot when some of my friends ask me to recommend some movies.\nAlso, it helped me a lot to choose movies to watch.\nFor example, recently i used it to choose crime movies from 60s and 70s from an acclaimed list i found.\n\nI apologize if something i wrote isn't clear to you, english is my second language.\n",

        "text": "I once read that some ideas for sequels to *Jaws* would be to make the first sequel a prequel and about Quint's survival during the sinking of the USS Indianapolis.  Then, there was to be a third sequel called *Jaws 3, People 0* that would've been an *Airplane*-style parody.\n\nI thought this idea was incredible.  You have three films that could standalone on their own, but united under a common theme.  The failure of one wouldn't retroactively change someone's opinion about another, since they're all so different in genre.  The first was a horror/thriller, the second would've been an historical drama/war film, and the third a straight parody.\n\nI've always wondered about having films connected through characters or basic plots, but changing the tone or genre.  I was daydreaming once and though of Alan Ruck's character in *Speed*.  He was a mild-mannered milquetoast guy who, if I remember correctly, was taking his first vacation in years.  And I thought about a movie that focused on this guy.  His feeble hopes and dreams, saving up his money working a deadend job and going to visit Hollywood by himself.  Seemed sad and lonely.  And I thought about what it would do to his psyche to basically venture out into the word just a tiny bit, and to treat himself to a tiny vacation, only for it to almost literally blow up in his face.  That guy is going to need some serious therapy.  There could be a good character drama, all about this minor side character from *Speed.*\n\nI also thought about rapid genre changes *within* a film.  For instance, what if there was a movie that was *Superbad* for the first 45 minutes to an hour, then switches to *Scream* or *Halloween* for the last thirty minutes.  IMHO, the most effective horror movies give you at least a taste of normalcy for the characters, so you can sense when things go wrong and feel empathy.  When you're just immediately dropped into killing and ominous vibes, the mind tends to rationalize it as \"wow, these people live in a crapsack world.\"",

        "text": "***Loro* is a biopic written and directed by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino about the life of Silvio Berlusconi, one of the most important political figures of Italy's recent history. Because of the deep impact he had as a prime minister and the unconventional approach of Sorrentino to what would've otherwise been just another political drama, I'll try to put this two-part movie into perspective for an international audience.**\n\nWhen my parents first met, in 1992, politics was very difficult topic to avoid, especially in Milan. The city had become the epicenter of the biggest political scandal of the century when the unearthing of a minor investigation had led to discovering an immense network of favors and gifts compromising most of the country’s political and economic leadership. You would’ve been hard pressed to  find someone whose employer hadn’t been summoned to court. My parents worked for a gargantuan industrial conglomerate, and unsurprisingly their cubicles were regularly raided by the financial police.\nI grew up hearing the stories of old socialist politicians trying to hide the grease money in the bookshop where I bought most of my childhood’s books, of how the collapse of the old order had happened almost overnight. \n\nFor my generation, there’s something inherently mythological to those years: it was as if every contradiction on which the republic had been founded, from corruption to the mafia, from political clientelism to a deeply flawed economic system, all had resurfaced in a single year. It also makes for great TV: Italy has recently experienced a surge of fiction set during the early 90s and usually focusing either the terror campaign of the Sicilian mafia (*La mafia uccide solo d’estate*, *Il cacciatore*) or the twilight of the old political elite (*1992*, *Il gioiellino*). \n\nHowever, if you were to judge by the settings of Italian series and movies, the country’s political scene stopped being interesting after 1994. That is the year in which Silvio Berlusconi first became prime minister, a short six months tenure that ultimately collapsed because of the government’s attempts to pass laws benefiting the entrepreneur’s companies. He wouldn’t be re-elected until 2001, but his mere presence on the political spectrum had already brought radical changes to Italy’s public life. \nThe great play that has been Berlusconi’s career has always run parallel to the lives of the generation born and raised during his times. My own prehistory, the first time my parents met, coincided with the clean slate on which “il cavaliere” was able to build his tenure. His exploits accompanied our formative years, his scandals dominated the cultural scene. He was an omnipresent figure in anything political, far beyond his role as leader of the biggest center-right party. The total control he had on his image meant that Italian politics could only be defined through his prism: you were either his backer or his opposer, and he was always able to seize the initiative with campaigns that scandalized his adversaries and tantalized his voters.\n Most importantly, he was a performer: whether he insulted prominent German politicians, made misogynist jokes or was persecuted for tax evasion or mafia, he was always able to embody different roles for different audiences. He morphed into different characters over my youth. When I was 10, in my family he represented the apotheosis of corruption, the criminal who had evaded capture and protected his loot by abusing the constitution. Around his last presidency, in the middle of my teen years, he had become a decadent king dragging the country into an economic abyss, captivated by an orgy of sex and power. To tell a story about Berlusconi isn’t hard just because of the intimate and yet heterogeneous knowledge the public has of his life, but also because during his 20 years in power he changed his mask so many times that trying to frame him through a single aspect of his career would not fully capture the cultural fallout he provoked. \n\nBecause of these factors, I believe that only Paolo Sorrentino could’ve been able to write and direct a movie about such a complex figure. To a certain degree, his entire filmography is dedicated to streamline existential struggles: whether he’s exposing the existential dread of Roman jet-set (*The Great Beauty*), or the psychological unraveling of a mafia front man (*The Consequences of Love*), he tends to strip away narrative contraptions and a clear sense of storylines, reducing the structure to a bare minimum. Unexpectedly, this often leaves a sense of pretentiousness or unease: the first scene of *[Loro](https://letterboxd.com/film/loro-1/)* is a grand example of this, as during the first few minutes the audience witnesses the death by heatstroke of a goat who entered Berlusconi’s villa in Sardinia, a lavish estate in which he spends much of the story. At its core, this is nothing more than an event setting the mood for the first part of the movie, which follows the attempts by an ambitious pimp to outsmart his colleagues higher in the food chain.  Moreover, Sorrentino’s passion for parties and intrigue are an especially strong asset.  He can seemingly merge well-choreographed social blow-outs and to transmit the rush of enthusiasm and vitality they provoke, while also employing a merciless camera capturing the deep squalor of the characters populating them. The protagonists of his movies always seem to be escaping from an unavoidable power-that-be casting a long shadow on their lives, be it the mafia or a state-run conspiracy. By highlighting the grotesque, he creates a cast of characters echoing Pirandello’s understanding of humor as putting the absurdity of human condition om display. \nHowever, it was clear that he couldn’t just apply his signature formulas to a character with such an embattled public image. Empathy for the characters’ painful existence is mitigated by the objective damage they caused to Italian public life. \n\nMoreover, there’s the issue of Berlusconi’s heavy personal legacy.  Not only was he the everyday bread of newspapers for decades, but the total control over his public image means that getting acquainted with his persona(s) may be the total opposite from knowing anything about him. This may be a familiar feeling for those masochists interested in Italian politics: their opacity is ever-more confusing because its multifaceted.  On a basic level, there are the kind of secrets on which it’s easy to build a narrative: the mysteries of false-flag attacks, secret encounters, assassinations are the kinds about which Andreotti bursts out in the climax of *Il Divo*, in a masterful interpretation of Toni Servillo: \n\n&gt; “They have no idea about what kind of misdeeds power must perpetrate to ensure the country’s welfare and development. For too many years, the power has been me. The monstrous, unspeakable contradiction: to do harm to guarantee right.”  \n\nBut if Servillo could interpet a Shakesperian villain, as Berlusconi he plays a salesman whose secrets are so banal and public that informed citizens can’t possibly hope on any great revelation. To have a full picture, they needed to engage in a true tour de force, to stay updated on the latest scandal, on a network of partygoers, of ski instructors (previous employment of a former foreign minister), of stable boys that turn out to be employed by the mafia. In Loro, Servillo interprets a man who shares little with Richard III and sees in simplicity and vitality his cardinal virtue:s \n\n&gt; “The left fails to figure me out, it thinks that everything is so complicated. And yet, everything is so elementary”.\n\nTo “understand” Berlusconi, we thus need to peel off the layers of characters he has worn over the course of the years. The audience is first lead through the undergrowth of politics living on his back in the first movie, leaving his political manipulations behind and going ever so back to his early days as a TV entrepreneur. The prism through which we witness this deconstruction is the separation with his second wife, a character who desperately tried to escape her past as cabaret dancer and too, albeit clumsily, wears masks over masks. However, while she’s still able to remove them at the height of their arguments, the tragedy of Berlusconi is that he has become those masks. In one scene, when a young girl refuses his sexual advances during a party, he finds himself unable to respond to her melancholic recriminations: “Cosa c’é dopo? What remains afterwards?”.\n\nLoro is maybe the only movie in recent memory which approaches the heart of politics by touching only briefly upon the political game: where many other try to find the essence of power in the political scheming, in the lust of power, Sorrentino paints the picture of a man who has burned the bridges behind him and can only live the moment. Although sometimes problematic, splitting the story in two movies is especially useful to craft the mirages of seductive women that populate the story: *[Loro 2](https://letterboxd.com/film/loro-2/)* is full of imagery which is not only pornographic in its content, but also structure: girls appear out of thin air and exist only to please. However, the audience had been made well aware of the logistics in the previous installment – leaving the kind of sordid aftertaste that Berlusconi himself perceives in moments of lucidity. Additionally, the movie makes little to no attempt to cross over to a documentary style: characters are altered and renamed, few existing individuals are explicitly mentioned, and even the timeline of the events deviates slightly from real life, with some scandals anteceding his last rise to power. Politics are seen more as an antidote to the dullness of his lavish life, little more than organizing another party. \n\nPeople who go in searching for a summary of those years will be disappointed, but it’s an abstraction that leaves more meaning than any verbalization of reality. This applies to the finale, too; we don’t get to see when the prime minister was ousted for his inability to contain the crisis that hit Italy in 2011, on the contrary, the movie leaves him at the beginning of his last term in office. However, just a year after the election, the government had to deal with the aftermath of the violent earthquake in L’Aquila, which killed 300 and left 80.000 without a home. The sense of powerlessness and the brutal return of reality of 2008 were similar to the final days of Berlusconi’s government, when the bad deeds of the last two decades (but also of his predecessors) came back with a vengeance, crippling Italy’s economy to this day. Even for my family there was no cheering when he left the presidential palace: he now played the role of the one who had brought the country to the brink of disaster. It wasn’t the last time we got to hear from him: in the following seven years, he was still able to play the kingmaker thanks to a highly fragmentized parliamentary system. This year’s elections however have left his party with less than half of the seats it had at its peak, overshadowed by its former junior partner, the League, and excluded from the government that came to be after months of negotiations. Today, if I see him on TV, the first thing that comes to mind is neither the number of criminal proceedings open against him, nor the arrogance or the decadence of his years in office; I just see an old man who truly believes to be the masks he’s wearing.\n\n\n",

        "text": "[Taipei Story 1985](https://i.redd.it/ab7lrlmpacd11.jpg)\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/31/taipei-story/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/31/taipei-story/) link for all the gorgeous visuals throughout the film and score. \n\n**I** have been looking for a new apartment, a task which has consumed a massive amount of my time and distracted me from other pursuits, like watching movies and writing reviews for Criterion Month. After spending a whole day walking around and viewing apartments, I sat down to watch *Taipei Story*. The film begins with Chin (Tsai Chin) and Lung (Hou Hsiao-hsien) walking around and viewing apartments. This is a familiar feeling for a cinephile, something I often experience during film festivals; sometimes, I’m not sure where my life ends and movies begin. And it’s not surprising when it comes to the cinema of Edward Yang, whose novel-like dramas unfold with such steady, hypnotic rhythm that they seem to bleed into my surroundings. After a screening of Yang’s recently restored 1986 film, *The Terrorizers*, I remarked to a friend that I could have sat and spent the rest of my day watching it. Once you’re grooving to a good film, you never want it to end. And once you’re grooving on Yang’s wavelength, you’re just living.\n\n*Taipei Story* is not as expansive in scope as *The Terrorizers*, but they share many aesthetic qualities. More than anything, they demonstrate Yang’s keen sense for how to balance multiple characters and plot threads, how and when to cut from one piece to another. The mood in *Taipei Story* is perfectly modulated from moment to moment, all the more impressive given that it’s only Yang’s sophomore film. The editing expertly captures the ebb and flow of urban life, tracing the characters through winding streets and neon lit buildings, while exploring their emotional and psychological states through their varied interpersonal interactions. It’s a cliché to compare Yang’s films to a novel, perhaps, but he truly earns that description.\n\nThroughout the film, we follow Chin and Lung as their relationship slowly disintegrates. Yang, who co-wrote the script with Hou Hsiao-hsien and Chu T’ien-wen, sends his two principal characters down different paths, holding their fractured relationship up as a mirror to a city rapidly transforming under the force of globalization. Chin and Lung illustrate an urban listlessness that is both specific to Taipei at that point in time and more broadly applicable to the changing economic realities we continue to face in today’s global village.\n\nThe specific politics of Yang’s film are detailed in [**Andrew Chan’s Criterion essay, “*****Taipei Story*****: Modern Planning.”**](https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/4628-taipei-story-modern-planning) The subplot involving Lung lending money to Chin’s father, and subsequently dashing or at least complicating and delaying his own plans for moving to California, is a reaction to Chinese culture and tradition. As per Chan,\n\n&gt;“For all the alienation and cultural rootlessness found in Yang’s vision of modernity, this depiction of a society shackled to age-old habits of filial piety signals the director’s unwillingness to romanticize a Confucian past littered with its own skeletons. \\[…\\] \\[A\\]nd while China is hardly mentioned, Yang’s argument against the presumption of inherent value in old ties could be interpreted as a subliminal refutation of the mainland’s historical claims to sovereignty over Taiwan.”\n\nIt is also a reaction to Taipei’s economic fortunes at the time, or perhaps a warning about the direction in which Taipei found itself moving; Chan notes that Yang was “resigned neither to the reassurances of tradition nor to the enticements of modernity” and that “Yang’s cynical appraisal of a proudly cosmopolitan city must have been hard to stomach for many Taiwanese of the period.” *Taipei Story* is explicitly a movie of its time, placed directly in dialogue with a city undergoing massive change; Yang’s consideration of Taipei in a global economic landscape, however, gives the film an enduring strength with broader appeal.\n\nYang’s analysis of Taipei is philosophical as well as political; by considering the global realities of modernity and situating Taipei within it, Yang adds another dimension to the film by contextualizing the politics of the day with a dose of existentialism. Much of the film’s drama, including the troubled relationship at the center of the story, is driven by the need to belong, and the difficulty of “belonging” to a world that is rapidly evolving, unstable, and in the process of unprecedented upheaval. Lung is often characterized as someone clinging to the past, to the former glory of his baseball career, and while true in a sense, his journey is more about an existential dislocation from the place he calls “home,” i.e. Taipei. The movie begins with him returning from California, where his family now resides. When asked how Los Angeles compares to Taipei, Lung merely replies that they’re similar. He does not fully believe this, as he reveals in a later scene, but it is the first indication that Lung’s concept of “home” has been pulled apart in various directions.\n\nMore obviously, Lung stops in Tokyo on his return trip to visit his ex, Gwan (Ko Su-Yun), a fact he hides from Chin. Gwan eventually appears in the film during a brief visit to Taipei. Lung and Gwan meet and walk through a playground, discussing their history together. Gwan swings on a swing set. Lung is mostly silent. There are memories in this park, of friends and family, of lives lived. Lung and Gwan return here to reconnect to a home they once had, and can no longer have again. They care for each other, or the ideas that they represent for each other, but there is no longer a clear sense of belonging. Gwan lives in Tokyo now, with her husband Kobayashi. Before they leave, she asks Lung when he will visit Tokyo again. He is silent for a brief moment, and the scene simply ends. More than just clinging to former glory, Lung clings to peopled he cares about, or once cared about, family and former flames alike, who have been scattered across the globe; he desperately clings to a concept of home that globalization has ruptured, and that he is aware he can no longer possess.\n\nChin similarly drifts between Lung and a former co-worker, holding on to fragments of relationships, scared to let go. One of the strengths of Yang’s dense layering of character and plot is that each and every part, however small, finds its own way to contribute something meaningful to a larger understanding of the whole. Gwan’s role provides a metaphor for a changing global landscape (her home is now somewhere between Taipei and Tokyo), and Chin’s co-worker, an architect, also gets an important scene illustrating one of the film’s key existential themes. He laments that buildings in Taipei are all beginning to look the same, and that he can no longer tell which ones he designed. “Whether I’m involved or not,” he says, “seems less and less important.” This is the uncomfortable reality of a rapidly evolving global modernity, the diminishing sense of belonging. Chin’s co-worker senses that he could remove himself from the equation and nothing about Taipei would change.\n\nYang also demonstrates these themes through his visuals. As Chin and her co-worker walk and talk about the concept of fate, Yang tracks them in a wide shot, two figures moving through an enormous architectural space, twice disappearing from sight. The massive structures of a modern Taipei seem to diminish, if not consume, the people in them.\n\nYang captures the scale of the city in a series of wide shots that emphasize the urban environment over the people in it, reducing pedestrians and automobiles to anonymous crowds.\n\nMost pointedly, the films ends with an image of a building that distorts the reflections of automobiles and other buildings around it. This image is the culmination of the film’s drama, politics, and aesthetics, the anonymous building of a faceless urban sprawl, twisting and distorting the reality of Taipei, fracturing the people who live there.\n\nWhile I was viewing apartments, everything started bleeding together. Each place started looking like the previous, and the next; my realtor commented that once you’ve seen one unit you’ve seen them all. Standing in a condo, looking out over the Toronto skyline, I felt like Chin’s co-worker. I began to doubt my plans, and my place in the city. I felt small and insignificant. It’s a familiar feeling in a massive urban area. And only hours later, I would watch an Edward Yang film and have those feelings thrown back at me again. That’s the power of Yang’s work; even a brief scene with a minor character can take up residence in your mind and expand in surprising ways. Yang explores the forces of modernity that were shaping Taipei in an increasingly globalized world, and the existential conditions he captures echo through space and time. *Taipei Story* was released in 1985, and reacts to a specific place and time, but over thirty years later, in different parts of the world, it feels no less relevant, vital, and immediate. And that’s the most impressive effect of Yang’s art: the immediacy of the experience, the way it captures the ebb and flow of life in the rhythm of the editing; the frame itself washes away, and all that remains is a feeling of presence, of living and breathing.\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/31/taipei-story/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/31/taipei-story/) link for all the gorgeous visuals throughout the film and score.",

        "text": "Have you ever loved every single quantifiable aspect of a movie(and the movie overall) whilst feeling completely lost and not understanding anything out of it? No? Well, neither have I… until this movie. To give some context, I have watched Eraserhead and later on everything Twin Peaks up until Season 3(that is to say that I haven’t watched the latest season yet). \n\nHaving watched Twin Peaks, I feel like I have it just a little bit easier identifying some aspects of this movie, but overall I’m still left very confused, but in a good, exciting kind of way. Everything about this movie, and I truly mean everything is through the roof. The two main actresses are great in their roles and give a lot of depth to their characters and Angelo Badalamenti’s score not only rivals that of Twin Peaks, but imo surpasses it as one of the best that I’ve ever head. \n\nI don’t know how to describe my feelings about this movie as like I said, I’m very uncertain what it is about. Is it a love story? A story about identity and what makes us who we are? Jealousy? Uncovering Hollywood? Was Naomi Watts playing different characters or was there a literal world within the blue box? Or was it a dream?? Who knows, and honestly, I’m not sure that it matters. What it is for me however is one of the best 2.5 hours that I’ve seen. Every single scene, and I mean pretty much every single scene kept me engaged, because either was funny, intriguing, lovely, cute, scary or all of the above. I know it sounds like a big cliché, especially when it comes Lynch, but it feels like a weird dream, of which you can only remember moments and bits. I don’t know what to say, I almost want to scream in joy, because it’s the only thing that comes to my mind, this movie feels alive, like it’s own living thing. I’m sure a lot of the ideas are scrapped versions of what Lynch had planned for the TV show, but at the same time I can’t help but feel like there’s a purpose behind everything(even if there really isn’t, although we can never know). In this state of confusion and mind-fuckery(sorry hate that word but it feels appropriate here) I would usually want to read and watch about 1000 theories to try to get the hang of it, and maybe I will, but for now I’m just left with this feeling of instantly wanting to re-watch it again. \n\nThis one was a strange one, as I can’t really identify a single theme or two that really holds the film together, unlike Eraserhead and Twin Peaks(both the show and movie) which both have some clear “points”/feelings that they’re trying to get across, and maybe it will come with time and rewatches, but so far I haven’t come up with anything regarding Mulholland Dr. \n",

Thank you for reading, and don't forget the question below for discussion. \n\n[Before and After Twin Peaks](https://i.redd.it/5edz674d28d11.jpg)\n\n **Part 1: Blue Velvet** [**https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/31/blue-velvet/**](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/31/blue-velvet/)\n\n[Blue Velvet](https://i.redd.it/i0afpifn38d11.png)\n\n**“A**ll of a sudden, thousands of robins were set free, and they flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it seemed like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. And it did. So I guess it means there is trouble until the robins come.” – Sandy (Laura Dern)\n\nDavid Lynch’s *Blue Velvet* is a dark but beautiful film about mystery, love, obsession and the darkness underneath everything, just out of view. It’s a work of genius and at times painful filmmaking that is wholly unique to its creator, the work of someone who has created a compelling world that means the world to him.\n\nKyle MacLachlan stars as Jeffrey, a young man back from college who gets caught in a mystery after finding a severed ear on his walk through the woods near his home. He brings it to the detective who lives nearby, whose daughter Sandy (played wonderfully by Dern) begins a friendship with Jeffrey and helps him discover there is more missing than just an ear. This leads to the apartment of Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini), a local nightclub singer, and the nightmare that is Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper).\n\nMacLachlan plays Jeffrey as excessively curious and thoughtful, as though he had been waiting for something like this to come along and sweep him up. He is excited for the opportunity to see the world from a different perspective, even if it’s from the closet of a woman’s apartment. What he sees through the slits of the closet door is terrifying and unleashes him into that world he wished to see. But he keeps going back, despite the danger. Is it the drive of such danger or sheer curiosity that keeps bringing him? It appears to be a little bit of both until that becomes something more lustful and emotionally charged.\n\nThe surrealness of a Lynch project adds a sense of wonder and awe to the affair. The use of people engaging in bizarre behavior at inopportune times is used spectacularly, like a woman dancing on the top of a car while Jeffrey is beaten by Frank. There is always something compelling in its other-worldliness, its objection in your mind to being at that place at that time, leaving you wondering if that really just happened, which, as it is a Lynch film, of course, it did.\n\nThe theme of darkness is important to *Blue Velvet*. Darkness is spoken of in a dream that Sandy describes, Dern giving a short but great monologue of how there was darkness because of the absence of robins, which represented love. The promise that the robins would one day return is played out in the use of bugs. The opening scene of Jeffrey’s father suffering a stroke on the lawn is capped by the sight of dozens, if not hundreds, of bugs, buzzing and clicking and clawing about, a nearly uncomfortable image of debauchery similar to Frank assaulting Dorothy in her apartment. In a previous scene, Jeffrey uses his cover as an exterminator to get into Dorothy’s apartment, acting as though he is ridding her kitchen of bugs to later gain access. And the end scene, with the sight of the robin with the bug in its mouth, is a symbol of the vanquishing of these bugs, that darkness, the light conquering over the dark. It’s connections like these that help give *Blue Velvet* its lasting power.\n\nFamiliar themes and touchstones from Lynch’s other works are at play, also, including emphasis on the red curtains blowing from Dorothy’s window, a bar that many of the characters frequent, a diner with apple pie, almost threatening industrial white noise, and a force of nature villain who is almost larger than life.\n\nHopper gives a performance of the ages in this film as Frank, an unhinged and incredibly dangerous man whose completely cracked emotional state is only combated by his love of huffing off an unknown gas line he carries with him everywhere he goes. His steel eyes holding on to his prey as he breathes deeply from his oxygen mask is a terrifying image, as are his profane and angry words he lobs at anyone in his path.\n\nOne of the most chilling moments of the film involves Frank taking Jeffrey and Dorothy on a ride to his cohort Ben’s house, and while threats of extreme violence and another piece of the puzzle fit into place, Ben lip syncs Roy Orbison’s song “In Dreams”. There are multiple shots of MacLachlan standing almost slack among Frank’s thugs, being held by his collar and in complete fear, while Hopper stares intently at his singing friend, experiencing various emotions of joy, bliss, anger, and devastation. It’s a hint that perhaps all of these emotions are the same for him, an amalgamation of love and pain that are never far apart.\n\nRossellini is put through a gauntlet in her role. It’s a tough performance to watch, not only in how pained and tortured her character is but the damage she is put through. She is violated and abused multiple times, even calling for it when engaged in consensual lovemaking. It is done for a point, though, as uncomfortable as it can be, as a woman who has been through unspeakable horrors and desperate to regain the family taken from her. And for the toughness, it takes to see her put through such things, and the anger it can cause, Rossellini delivers something both powerful and memorable.\n\nThis film is fascinating from the get-go, straining emotions that are almost like raw nerves. It’s equal parts heartbreaking in its masterful direction and beautifully sincere with its dream-like quality and convictions. Nothing ever feels out of place, everything holding meaning in the eye of the beholder and becoming a journey that’s quite unlike anything else outside of the Lynch universe.\n\nJeffrey asks Sandy, “Why are there people like Frank? Why is there so much trouble in this world?” It’s a question this movie feels like it wants to answer, but it doesn’t because there is no real answer for it. There’s going to be darkness, just as there will be light, and eventually, that light will come. But that darkness will try and steal anything it can before it is vanquished. Fortunately, in *Blue Velvet*, that light is enough when the robins come. It’s a film that grips your very being and demands you to see what it has to show, and you come out the other side having experienced one of the very best of the 1980’s, and one of the best mystery films the genre has to offer.\n\n**Part 2: Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me** [**https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/30/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me/**](https://thefilmera.com/2018/07/30/twin-peaks-fire-walk-with-me/)\n\n[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me](https://i.redd.it/gta00p6i38d11.jpg)\n\n **P**requels have a strict formula. They set up the stories we already love and play into what we loved about them. The idea is to capture everything that worked in a capsule and translate its formula into an origin story. *Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me* breaks the formula entirely. It does not offer any particular fan service or feelings of comfort, like how you feel when you’ve returned home after a long stint somewhere else. Instead, it’s steeped in unease and provides an entirely new series of questions about *Twin Peaks*. \n\nIt does not show nostalgic love for the two seasons of *Twin Peaks* that preceded it. In the opening shots, a television goes to static and is promptly cut down with an ax. This is an artist declaring their work dead and saying the process was final. David Lynch created television that broke all of the rules and now he is destroying actual televisions, telling us something of his intent here.\n\n*Fire Walk with Me* is a difficult movie to come to grasps with. It initially opened to sour and confused reviews. Why would you expand this wonderful universe and throw out everything that works? Its first forty minutes don’t even take place in Twin Peaks but another town, Deer Meadows, which is inflicted with the same spiritual evil. It doesn’t even star Twin Peak’s beloved Agent Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan). Critics were confounded by its release: why create such a non-sequitur off on its own tangent, and maybe inside its own nightmare, when working within a version of a popular television show?\n\nThe reason is that this is the show that Lynch wanted to create. It took me many tries to get to the truth or to convince myself that this was an underrated masterpiece. In fact, the movie got better with every repeat viewing, a bold acquired taste – like the best coffee blend – that grows with you and alongside you and reveals its depth and weight as you accept loving it on its own terms.\n\nThe other thing about *Fire Walk with Me* is that, as separate and weird as it can be, it’s an essential component to understanding the universe. I think it has improved dramatically now that it has been connected to the recent *Twin Peaks: The Return*. This has to be cause for reappraisal. It’s now a central motivating part of the universe and made more valuable by new association. Where it was once an odd preface to a disconnected TV show, it’s now a pivotal piece of required viewing to understand where everything comes from.\n\nThis is Laura Palmer’s (Sheryl Lee’s) movie. It’s the manifesto of her troubled life showing how things got to be so bad. Where she was only an ethereal beauty, distanced from time and place before, she is now central, moving toward a death we all know about; we can cringe as we watch her demise. Even if we hadn’t known, her fate is spelled out in plain letters. There is already a spirit of death inhabiting this once sweet high school girl.\n\nSheryl Lee gives an inspired performance. It’s clear at every turn she’s given herself entirely to the production. She brings a brilliant energy to the film. Where she was once only the premise, she is now the movie and it almost certainly benefits, as she turns in several of the finest scenes to come out of *Twin Peaks*.\n\nEven if you’ve gone through it before, it’s time to give *Fire Walk with Me* its reappraisal. Now that it is a central foundation to the new show, it will require a couple hours of your attention anyway if you want anything like a complete understanding of what is going on. And it’s a special prequel, once again breaking every role of form.\n\nOur initial viewing may have been startling. *Fire Walk with Me* is a rejection of what has come before and what we expect from this kind of outing. Try to get on the same wavelength and its genius will slowly seep out. Just like Laura Palmer, we must enter the painting to understand the darkness of our world.\n\n**Thank you guys for reading, What are your thoughts on David Lynch, Twin peaks, and these two films TrueFilm?**",

        "text": "I’ve noticed that when I think about recent movies in genres such as sci fi, horror, and action, that these past couple of years have been giving us a lot of surprisingly fun and entertaining movies that also have been very well received and technically proficient in their filmmaking. \n\nWith Sci-Fi we’ve had hits like Interstellar, The Martian, Arrival. Smaller movies like Arrival, Ex Machina, Her, and The Shape of Water which I consider a fantasy sci fi. And then Blade Runner 2049 which is easily one of my favorite films I’ve seen. \n\nA24 has caused a big revival of arthouse horror with The Witch, It Comes at Night, and Hereditary and also hits like A Quiet Place, It, and Get Out have done incredibly well, with Get Out being one of few horror films to win an Oscar. \n\nI have never been huge on action films but I absolutely loved Baby Driver and Mad Max, and the past 3 Mission Impossible movies have continued to destroy my expectations, with Fallout being one of my favorite action films I’ve ever seen. Upgrade is one from this year that could loosely fall into any of these three categories that I believe was very well put together. \n\nMaybe this is just cause I’ve watched so many movies from these past few years, or maybe you could argue that any year is great for a particular genre if a few good movies come out but I feel like we’re in the middle of an era of amazing science fiction and we’re beginning to see a resurgence in well crafted and masterfully executed horror and action films. It’s really nice to see grander scale movies that actually seem to care and put in the work instead of being thoughtless cash grabs. \n\nWhat do you guys think are the greatest eras of filmmaking for these genres and do you believe they’ve been increasing in quality over the past few years?

I went on a bit of a binge and watched Phantom of the Paradise, Dressed to Kill, Blow Out, and Femme Fatale within a few days. I plan on watching Carrie today.\n\nBlow Out if often considered De Palma's best work and I was in agreeance with that, but upon viewing Femme Fatale last night I might have actually enjoyed it more. However, I'm having difficulty figuring out what exactly made me like it so much.\n\nFemme Fatale's story is ridiculous. Sure, it's coherent but it's still kind of silly. The whole time I was watching it, it didn't really feel like it was going anywhere. Despite this, De Palma still managed to tie it all together with a beautiful bow. The film is just so well made and I guess I'm having a tough time distinguishing why that's the case. De Palma films are always well shot, but this felt like the culmination of all his experience. The score also blew me away because it doesn't sound like it belongs in an erotic thriller and yet it's weaved so elegantly throughout the film. There's also a lot of non-dialogue scenes which I appreciate. It reminded me of the opening to Dressed to Kill expect this time around it felt like De Palma mastered the skill.\n\nI'm hoping we can get a discussion going about the film. I expect a lot of you will be able to articulate your thoughts on the film better than I can. See you in the comments!",

        "text": "It's widely accepted that film is a 2 faced coin, there's the art side and the entertainment side. The Tree of Life vs Mission Impossible. Of course both have their place and they are both great for very different reasons. \n\nAnyway, I asked myself what makes a director stick out and become a sort of cultural icon. How did directors like Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, and Steven Spielberg get to be lauded by both critics and general audiences? What do these directos have that allowed them to become more than just famous directos and become cultural icons? I came to the conclusion that it all comes down to being able to play with the two faces of what a movie is. Their movies tend to have both artistic and entertaining qualities, and they manage to do it in a very organic way. Take Pulp Fiction for example, it is very clear that the film was made with passion, love, and artistry; yet it's not a film that general audiences would find boring or overly artsy. It's incredibly entertaining at face value but still has many layers and artistic merit, while never shoving it in your face; it is simply there for the viewer to appreciate or ignore at will. It's a movie that can be both simply enjoyed and deeply analysed. Same goes for Saving Private Ryan and Goodfellas. I think movies that are made with this approach manage to transcend and become cultural landmarks, and directors that are great at doing it become the most iconic ones. These are the movies that can reach the widest audience and be enjoyed by the most amount of people. \n\nOf course this is not to say that other movies always fall strictly on one category. Most movies have aspects of both, but they can definitely be pinned to one side. These directors are special because they can make movies that fall in the middle or very close to the middle of this spectrum. Take The Wolf Of Wall Street, you could easily make an argument for it being an entertainment-type movie or an art-type movie, it simply is both.\n\nIn a way I feel like these directors are the ones who truly \"get\" movies the most. They are able to appreciate both sides of what a movie is, and are able to excel at making either type of movie. And most importantly, they are able to use both in perfect unison. These directors know that they don't have to \"choose a side\" in art vs entertainment, in fact they go a step further by knowing that these sides can complement each other beautifully when mixed. By making movies with this quality the director is (too a certain extent) giving the viewer the power of choosing which type of movie experience he or she wants to have, and I think that is simply amazing.

How can he state that he can't live by the Seven Deadly Sins being on every street and home, giving him his motivation to commit his actions, but can't see past the fact that he killed an innocent woman, which would bring his work to just being chalked up as being another psycho serial killer? I found that his murdering of Tracy completely deligitimize his points, and while he may have wanted these actions to be remembered as a man standing up to the corruption we place in our daily lives, submissively or actively, he took it away by taking the life of a woman who was not deserving. Same with the man who he forced to fuck the prostitute. He was also impacted similar to Mills, but while you can say this man was indulging in lust, Tracy ultimately was not clearly violating any sins. Maybe you can just say that he used his place of \"envy\" and the killing of her to create him as the final sin, but I don't really believe that, as he was shown earlier while Morgan Freeman's character was reading his journals, showing that he had contempt and perhaps envy to those who were able to live and sustain normal lives. \n\nSo, I guess my final question for the film is, does Doe's killing of Tracy detract from his message and motive that he established while confessing in the car ride? He claimed not to kill innocents to give his murders weight, but he did kill an innocent woman, thus detracting from the murders that he committed. Any thoughts/opinions on the film are welcome, as I'm dying to talk to people about this film, it's imagery, dialogue and cinematography!",

Even Taxi Driver and goodfellas doesn't capture the dread and frustration of the whole narrative like this movie. The kind of set pieces and Lighting he used for this movie are so transcendental in the way that I felt Iike watching a late night show skit by a comedian! Basically, it plays with the audience emotion all the time. It's a clockwork orange of Martin's movies.\n\n  \n\n\nI understand the circumstances behind why this movie failed critically and commercially in its time. The kind like Dark absurdist comedy of a character with psychosis was way ahead of its time.\n\nAt the end It generates lots of question about society and individual's desires and dreams to attain the social heirarchy. Who are we to blame such psychosis for Robert Pumpkin? The culture or his childhood abuse?\n\n And the way it deals with fantasy/dreams is second to the none. David Lynch would appreciate the language Scorsese used here to convey the dreams. Damn! This movie is a postmodern masterpiece which we as a society failed to recognise which in fact reflects the intent of the movie itself!  \n  \n",

        "text": "William Shakespeare’s writings have always been a great source of inspiration for many artists. From poems to stage plays to movie adaptations, the world has seen many worthy (and some unworthy) works influenced by the legend of the Bard. One of those came in the form of Tom Stoppard’s 1966 play “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead”, which took two minor characters of Hamlet and proceeded to tell the story from their point of view. The play was adapted into a Golden Lion winning film in 1990, directed by Stoppard himself and starring Tim Roth and Gary Oldman as the titular characters. The result is a tragicomedy of absurdist depth that tackles one of the greatest literary works in world history.\n\nAs the title suggests (beyond its obvious spoiler), the film focuses on Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two old friends of prince Hamlet (Ian Glen), as they are called upon by the treacherous King Claudius (Donald Sumpter) to check on the young prince, for he’s been acting strange as of late. Like in the classic play, Claudius is responsible for Hamlet’s father’s murder, something that the prince is slowly figuring out. Of course, all of this is unbeknownst to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, two lovable fools who only want to get their assignment done and go back home. The two engage in ruminations about life, death, freedom and destiny throughout, and even meet a troupe of actors lead by the mysterious Player (Richard Dreyfuss), who seem to have some sort of supernatural knowledge of the events yet to unfold. And even if the two main characters are just pawns of larger schemes, there’s nothing that can ultimately save them from their doomed fate.\n\nhttps://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/07/28/rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead-shakespearian-absurdity/",

I did not know what I was getting myself into when I started this. \n\nI’m a huge fan of coming of age films, they’re my favorite genre (if it can be considered one). I’ve seen a lot of the classic coming of age films like Rebel Without a Cause and basically all of John Hughes’ filmography, but there’s something different about this one. \n\nThis one is so raw and heartbreaking. It touches on one of the big themes in pop culture: being young and in love. Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood play their parts of naive teenagers in love so well. All they want to do is be together, but they can’t. On one of the film’s posters it says this:\n“Whether you live in a small town they way they do, or in a city, maybe this is happening to you right now...maybe (if you’re older) you’ll remember...when suddenly the kissing isn’t a kid’s game anymore, suddenly it’s wide-eyed scary and dangerous.”\n\nI think that sums it up perfectly. People always talk about how you’ll never forget your first love, and this really highlights that to the point where it makes you afraid you’ll never get over them. Hell, I’ve never even had a first love, but this film made me miss mine. \n\nI’d like to know what people’s opinions are on it and what they think of it as a coming of age film. Did you resonate with it? What did it make you feel? How would you rank it amongst other coming of age films (recent or old)?\n\nAnd to anyone who hasn’t watched it: please do. ",

Quite frequently I found the scenes to be too dimly lit. \n\nThere’s a huge risk that one runs into by reducing the lighting of a scene. For one thing, you are deliberately reducing the visual information of that scene. Our eyes naturally move to the areas that are well-lit. And if maximum portion of a film is dimly it, it’s quite stressful to watch, IMHO. The viewer is constantly waiting for clarity so that they can visually absorb the world of the film. \n\nAnd while I was mulling over this, a film that was constantly coming to my mind was 2001: A Space Odyssey for its stark visual clarity. I re-visited the film, and this time paid particular attention to the lighting. And found that almost everywhere Kubrick manages to have his subjects in light, by clever positioning of the characters near a source of light. And by avoiding too many exterior night shots. This strategy gives clarity to the visuals and at the same time makes it look natural - it doesn't look like the light is coming from any artificial source.\n\nI complied all my thoughts in the video above. With the help of images it’ll be clear, what I’m trying to communicate. Do let me know what you guys feel about it.\n\nAlso, I understand that the dim lighting scheme of Blade Runner goes very well with the dystopian future world. But somehow I feel that when it comes to film aesthetics, dimly lit visuals just don’t work. And specially when a lot of it feels unmotivated – which is what I felt about Blade Runner. ",

        "text": "As a devoted fan of horror films, I am constantly in search of new material which is able to offer a more compelling kind of thrill than soulless jump-scares. The most fascinating capabilities of horror genre are its therapeutic and cathartic qualities, its power of both individual but also collective psychoanalysis. As such, New French Extremity understandably became a movement that struck my attention. This article will provide a short introduction for further analysis of its signature films. I’ll post more in the coming weeks for you guys, if you like this!\n\nThe phrase New French Extremity or New French Extremism was coined by James Quandt for the art magazine Artforum. The critic developed the phrase as a pejorative in order to describe a unique group of transgressive films that appeared in French theatres in the beginning of 1990’s. Quandt (2004) described them as:\n\n“Cinema suddenly determined to break every taboo, to wade in rivers of viscera and spumes of sperm, to fill each frame with flesh, nubile or gnarled, and subject it to all manner of penetration, mutilation, and defilement.”\n\nIndeed, the work of directors creating in the spirit of New French Extremism is considered dark and taboo, often featuring graphic visual representations of incest, cannibalism, and rape. Despite this, the films are not always classed as horrors: One of the most famous films of New French Extremity is Intimacy (2001) directed by Patrice Chéreau which is an arguably poetic exploration of bodies during intercourse. Nevertheless, critics that excessively focus on the vivid depictions of sex and violence in New French Extremity often omit the historical factors that influence its directors.\n\nThere is ongoing academic debate on the formal classification of this cinematic tendency, however, it seems to be meeting Bordwell and Thomspon’s criteria that define a movement. According to the researchers a film movement ‘consists of two elements: films that are produced within a particular period and/or nation and that share significant traits of style and form; and filmmakers who operate within a common production structure and who share certain assumptions about filmmaking’ (Nicodemo, 2013: 7).\n\nNew French Extremity restores French history as collective memory by using inductive images and unsettling styles that disturb and upset the spectator. It is the country’s way of dealing with past traumas and present shared feelings of uncertainty and lack of security. In my following analysis of the movement-defining films, I am going to draw on their implications to crucial moments in the formation of French national identity. These include events such as the May ’68 protests and strikes, Vichy collaboration with the Nazis, nation-wide riots in 2005 that involved discontent youth of North African heritage, as well as  recent tensions revolving around race and equality that overtook the soul of the French nation under Nicolas Sarkozy’s presidency. \n\nInterestingly, it is easy to find these cinematic parallels in other film movements, including Dogma 95, German Expressionism, and French New Wave that were born from social  anxieties and Freudian ‘repressed demons’ that haunted the shared national consciousness. As well as its cathartic qualities, all these cinematic tendencies share another feature: a desire to break free from old order and establish new rules through total rebellion. \n\nSimultaneously, exploring cinema’s tactility and physical effects on spectators is useful while examining the films of New French Extremism and its controversial approach to human’s body. Therefore, they can be considered as a “cinema of the body”. Following Deleuze:\n\n“Give me a body then”: this is the formula of philosophical reversal. The body is no longer the obstacle that separates thought from itself, that which it has to overcome to reach thinking. (…) It is through the body (and no longer through the intermediary of the body) that cinema forms its alliance with the spirit’. (1989:182)\n\nDeleuze’s account is important as it regards the ability of “body films” to diagnose the unspeakable violence and dehumanisation of civilisations. He describes their directors by the Nietzschean name ‘physicians of civilisation’ (Pisters, 2003: 81).\n\nIf you enjoy this, I love talking about films here and in the next few weeks I can post about a few films in particular, I’m always looking for new perspectives and in the past I’ve really enjoyed hearing from you all. Especially when I posted about A Ghost Story. I’m on mobile and not sure how to link that one unfortunately, sorry!\n\nIf you want, though Reddit is good, you can read it on my website [here](https://www.filmosophy.co.uk/new_french_extremity.html) . I’ve just started writing about films recently, and it’s made me feel so happy that I started that little site so that I can hopefully connect with more people that love films!",

This then led me to my main interpretation of the film that we as humans mirror those who raised us.\n\nLike his father who mirrored his father into going into war and the father wanting Ignat to enter the service.\n\nand like a father has a plan for his son; a son is driven to mirror qualities of their father even if they are rebellious\n\nI looked through two reddit posts after my viewing of the movie and neither of them shared this so I don't know if this is a common interpretation.\n\nMy next thought I do not know if im correct but:\n\nTowards the end Ignat (or young dad) looks at a mirror and you see he has a cold sore from kissing the girl. yet earlier ignat does in fact learn his father was romantically intimate at his age.\nI was thinking that the cold sore WAS Ignat rather than the father and through the mirror saw his Father as him and felt the connection of his presence without him being there.\n\nThis intrepreation also goes with the fact that Andrei became a poet like his father\n\n\n\n",

Well after almost 6 months he has not only accomplished his goal, but wrote about his thoughts before and after. The link above is the original article with all the pictures and scores for each film. Thank you for reading TrueFilm &lt;3.\n\n**I**‘ve kind of procrastinated on this so that I could get some distance between the last Godzilla movie and my thoughts on the series as a whole. Doing this too close to finishing that last film may have skewed things a bit and I really want to look at the whole series from a bit of distance. For those who have not read the original spotlight, [**it is available here**](https://thefilmera.com/2018/01/18/godzilla-showa-era-king-of-the-kaiju/). So how do you sum up many films that range from 1954 original to the final entry in this era from 1975?\n\nA little back story first. Criterion picked up several of the Showa Era Godzilla films and put them in a collection on Filmstruck called Godzilla and Beyond which really means that they have added a few extras that are not part of the Godzilla series. The Showa Era is defined as the period of time that Emperor Hirohito ruled over Japan until his death. These movies were all released during that time frame, hence the name of the series.\n\nI would first say that the series had a lot of surprises in store for me. For instance, you look at the films and say it’s just a dude in a rubber suit smashing up a cardboard town. However, the first film was so much more than that. It was a very socially and politically relevant piece about post-war Japan and overcoming the fear of the nuclear bomb. The first film came out just under ten years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki so those events were still very fresh to the people of Japan. An interview on Filmstruck compares Godzilla in the first movie to Japan in WW2. Basically saying that Japan was the big monster that science had to come along and stop.\n\nSurprisingly, there was no mention of good or evil or who or what unleashed Godzilla. I would think it would be easy to throw blame against the American bomb, but there was no mention of who created Godzilla, simply that he needed to be stopped because of all the devastation he was causing. Sure, nuclear bombs started him, but there just wasn’t any mention of where those came from. It may be that the idea wasn’t something that needed to be spoken in those days. Anyway, the first film offered quite a bit more than anticipated for a so-called guy in a rubber suit flick.\n\n*Godzilla Raids Again* was the second entry to the series in 1955. With the death of Godzilla in the first one, we get a new Godzilla for this movie. So another surprise was that there simply wasn’t just one Godzilla. Before I watched this series, my only Godzilla movie exposure was from the 1998 Roland Emmerich version and maybe one or two of the “actual” entries. Needless to say, I had a very limited view of just what the series was about. I think the only movies I watched had Godzilla tearing things up on his own. I had no clue there were any other Kaiju that he would fight. Yet in just the second entry, we have a sparring partner for the big guy to go up against.\n\nLooking back at my comments about the second film, this one felt a bit long for its ninety minutes run time. There was a lot of fluff about some sort of love story that was tossed in between the big monster fights, which was another surprise. The series spends a lot of time on human elements throughout. Each entry has had some form of a human story that goes alongside the monster bits. In most cases, the human parts far exceed the monster parts with varied results.\n\nThe next film that Filmstruck offers is *Godzilla, King of the Monsters!* which is pretty interesting on its own because this film is the original movie with a lot of edits and an American dub. Raymond Burr got to star in it amidst all the edits that were put in place. I kind of wish this version was played a bit differently. The edits made for a tighter movie, but the whole story was altered a bit to make Burr’s reporter character fit. I’d have preferred that they injected him into the original with maybe some on scene reporting instead of shoehorning him into the story. I think if this was done right, it would have been a nice companion piece to the original by showing some sort of alternate viewpoint.\n\n*Rodan* is up next from 1956. This is not a Godzilla film at all but was a welcome addition because it sets up a future movie where Godzilla and Rodan team up. My review for this entry was pretty glowing. There was less of the human side here, but what they did show was pretty tight without all the needless love story. I especially like the effects in this one. We got some good devastation\n\nUnfortunately, at this point, we skip an entry in the series. *King Kong vs Godzilla* (1962) should be in the collection, but it looks like someone else owns the rights to it. I’d like to see this one someday because these are the original, big monsters going at it. Like an early *Alien vs Predator* or *Freddy vs Jason*.\n\nThe fifth movie in the collection is *Mothra vs Godzilla* (1964) which I really liked a lot. This one had some really nice special effects for the time and a pretty cool story. There were also some weird, tiny people that really never showed up much or ever again. I noted that this entry still maintained the message that Godzilla is the big atomic monster we need to be protected from, but this entry is pretty much where that stops.\n\n1964 also saw *Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster* released. I’m not sure how the cast and crew churned these out so quickly because both of the films released in 1964 were excellent. In this entry, we get Mothra, Rodan, and Godzilla working together for the first time because Ghidorah is this monstrous three-headed beast that takes a lot of teamwork to tackle. The climactic battle is once again, the centerpiece of the movie.\n\n*Invasion of Astro-Monster* continues the line in 1965 and this one reminded me a lot of some of the Bond films from that era. You’ve got an enemy that has this elaborate bunker bent on conquering the world. Only instead of spies and evil geniuses, we get aliens from Planet X “borrowing” our big monsters to take care of the Ghidorah menace on their planet. Turns out, they really control Ghidorah and just wanted to use our monsters against us. This was a good entry to the series, but a little weaker than the last couple.\n\nIn 1966 we get to *Ebirah, Horror of the Deep* which is also missing from the Criterion collection which is unfortunate. Some of the footage from this film is actually pieced into one of the later entries. So if you are going through the Criterion offering, you run across this weird monster you’ve never seen before.\n\nBack in the Criterion collection is *The War of the Gargantuas* from 1966. From my notes, I listed this as the best of the Kaiju movies on Filmstruck and I believe that still stands. The Godzilla films all kind of follow the same template. In this film, director Ishiro Honda, who did numerous of the Godzilla films, got to do something completely different. He explores a science experiment gone wrong and the consequences of it, but the story doesn’t have anything to do with Godzilla or any of the other monsters. This is a very stand-alone entry in this collection that feels really fresh amidst the typical Godzilla formula. Not that there is anything wrong with the formula, but it was very cool to see what else could be done.\n\nI kind of dreaded watching *Son of Godzilla* which was released in 1967. The premise looked insanely stupid. Godzilla has a kid that gets attacked by a spider, but it somehow worked out to be a very charming film overall. We don’t get the big cities to trample here. Instead, were on a tropical island with a few scientists, but what we lack in overall destruction gets made up for in the monsters. There are several giant critters with this mega spider being the big villain. Overall, this was a nice change of pace.\n\n*Destroy All Monsters* stomped onto the big screen in 1968 and from what I have read, this was to be the final Godzilla due to the popularity of the series falling which is apparent from having like eight or nine different monsters appear. It was like the creators decided to go out with every claw on deck. We get the aliens back again, only this time with a mind control device they use to take over the monsters and turn them against Earth. Instead of being the last of its kind, this film kind of revitalized the big monster movies a bit.\n\nWhich lead to *All Monsters Attack* being released in 1969 and I’m not entirely sure this was the best foot forward although it kind of works. The story here is about some kid getting bullied who imagines getting advice from Godzilla’s kid. You’d think this would be complete trash, but it was kind of a fun and a very different entry into the series. The kid has to face school bullies as well as some criminals holed up in a local run-down building. In this case, the monsters are truly human with Kaiju being in the kid’s imagination.\n\nThe timeline says Criterion is missing *Godzilla vs Hedorah* (1971) and *Godzilla vs Gigan* (1972). Quite honestly, these didn’t ever come up in my research of the other films, so I can’t say much about them. I don’t believe any of the monsters Godzilla fights in either show up in any of the other films.\n\n*Godzilla vs Megalon* came out in 1973 and I first caught this on Fandor when I was still subscribed to that streaming service. Randomly, they had this lone entry into the Godzilla series that I watched one day. I did not care for this very much the first time I watched it. Going into this movie without any real experience of the series overall was a complete mistake. Even watching this one a second time, I would, without a doubt, put this at the very bottom of the list although I did like it more the second time. This film is very 70’s from the dune buggy to the clothing that the cast wears, but that isn’t what drags this one down. It’s just a weak entry overall. My initial review called this Power Rangers from the 70’s and I think that is a very accurate description.\n\nThe year 1974 brought *Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla* out into the world. We get some new alien invaders who have constructed a giant mech that rivals Godzilla in size and power. We also get another new monster to fight alongside Godzilla. This would also be the first time blood flows from a monster in any of these movies. I guess some competing franchises were getting gory so some of that was inserted here as well.\n\nFinally, *Terror of Mechagodzilla* from 1975 rounds out the Showa Era. The big mech from the previous film is back with a new monster villain and the pesky aliens are back and once again bent on taking over the world.\n\nIn the time since I started this marathon, I’ve watched a few other films that are in the same realm and I feel are worth mentioning. The first Gamera (1965) was available so I gave that one a shot. It’s a black and white monster flick that copies a lot of the original Godzilla film except it stars a giant turtle. I want to explore more of this series because the gory bits of Godzilla were apparently borrowed a bit from this series.\n\nAnother pair of movies I watched is *Pacific Rim* and it’s recent sequel. Both of those reviews are also available here on FilmEra and you may be surprised to see that I’ve scored them so highly. In the case of *Pacific Rim*, I think director Guillermo del Toro really captured the essence of these old Godzilla films. We have giant saviors going up against equally giant monsters except for the human element in this actually means and controls the giant robot saviors. For *Pacific Rim: Uprising*, it gets bonus points for the big battle in Tokyo which looks incredible with modern effects. I’ve been wanting to see something like that with each new Godzilla entry I’ve watched.\n\nSeeing modern films grow and adapt the Godzilla formula from so many years ago is nice to see. The biggest thing I’ve gotten from this marathon is a deep appreciation for a series I’d had little investment into. Godzilla has definitely made a very big impact on monster movies over the years. I look forward to checking more of these out. Unfortunately, Criterion only has up through 1975. The series took a decade-long break from there which probably means a whole new cast and crew as well as direction. I have watched the recent *Shin Godzilla,* which was incredible, so I know the series is still going strong, but I kind of wonder about the 80’s.\n\nAnyway, I will wrap this long article up by saying that I hope you’ve enjoyed this trip through the Showa Era. It’s been really fun for me to go through these. I love old sci-fi movies from the 50’s and 60’s so it was a treat for me. I also look forward to continuing the reviews of future installments as I get to them.\n\nThank you for reading! -Ken Cikas",

But it led me down a wiki-hole and I found out the existence of a little-seen documentary called *The Sweatbox,* which is supposed to be a good look at why Disney kind of ceded the crown of animation to Pixar.\n\nI'm in my mid-thirties (dear god...) so I remember being a kid during the prime years of the Disney resurgence.  *The Little Mermaid,* *The Lion King,* *Aladdin* and *Beauty and the Beast* were all seen in the theater, and all were well loved both critically and commercially.\n\nI think it was *Pocohontas* that might've been the first film where people just seemed unenthused over the whole thing.  Maybe it was the fact that I was around 13 when it came out and growing out of \"kid's stuff,\" but I just don't remember it capturing that zeitgeist like the others.  I remember hearing good things about *Mulan,* how surprisingly dark *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* was, *Lilo and Stitch* and the aforementioned *New Groove* were also seemingly well liked, but admittedly I fell out of the demographic and didn't catch those movies.\n\nI was wondering if anyone had seen *The Sweatbox* and what they thought of it.  One review seemed to say that it was a case of executives keeping the creative dreamers down, but *New Groove* was kind of well liked, and the original movie, *Kingdom Of The Sun,* well... *did* sound kind of typical and bland, a reworking of The Prince and the Pauper story with music by Sting.  It didn't, from description, sound like we were going to miss the next groundbreaking piece of work.\n\nCurious to hear people's thoughts on the Disney fall from grace from the late-90s until they discovered computer animation and resurged with *Frozen* and *Wreck-It Ralph.*",

I highly recommend you check out his baseball drama.\n\n**K**obayashi Masaki’s *I Will Buy You* is a baseball drama that focuses on talent scouting as a metaphor for the ruthlessness of post-war capitalism. The drama unfolds swiftly, packing a lot of plot into its two hours, hurried almost to a fault. But it also manages to cover a lot of ground, creating a complex and nuanced portrait of the cruelty and greed of this new economic reality. It’s a cynical film, but it maintains a humanist soul. Kobayashi cares deeply for his characters, even as they tear each other apart. In this world, integrity is a prize won through severe hardship.\n\n*I Will Buy You* stars Sada Keiji, an actor who quickly rose to fame during the fifties and was tragically killed in a car accident at the height of his career, at the age of 37. His role in this film garnered him two Best Actor awards. It’s a good performance, but that’s often despite the script, which is uneven in its dramatic development and saddles him with a lot of expository dialogue. Sada plays the talent scout, Kishimoto. Ôki Minoru plays Kurita Gorô, the prize hitter Kishimoto wants to sign, along with every other major team. The film also stars Kishi Keiko (Kobayashi fans will remember her as Yuki in *Kwaidan*) as Fueko, Kurita’s love interest, and Ito Yunosuke as Kyuki, the man who helps raise Kurita and teaches him baseball, and whom the talent scouts must win over if they want to win Kurita.\n\nKishimoto is the heart and soul of the film. His increasing disillusionment with his profession dovetails with the film’s scathing indictments. His journey offsets the film’s cynicism to a degree, as it maintains the possibility for moral integrity and genuine empathy in the face of corrupt and unethical business practices, which one character explicitly compares to human trafficking later in the film. His internal dilemma, however, is often expressed outwardly with some poorly written drama, scenes that are overly melodramatic and saddled with insipid and expository dialogue. These scenes often function to signpost character emotions and explain the film’s themes. The frequent outpouring of emotion also feels naive in the context of the plot’s byzantine ruthlessness, and the fact it is rarely exploited makes the film almost shockingly optimistic.\n\nKobayashi generally directs these scenes well, maintaining a sharp visual sense and good rhythm. But he cannot fix the structural problems inherent in the screenplay. Kishimoto also provides regular voice-over narration, framed as work notes addressed to his boss, in which he describes events as they are happening and explains the character traits of the various people he meets and what he will have to do to win them over to his cause (i.e. advance the plot). It’s nothing more than a cheap storytelling device, ensuring audiences are keeping up with the dense plot and large cast of characters; it never builds to anything, or adds anything meaningful to the story, beyond (often redundant) exposition. It’s no surprise that a film with so much plot feels the need to signpost, but Matsuyama Zenzô’s script overcompensates to the detriment of its drama.\n\nNor does it help that so many plot details are superfluous. A subplot about Kyuki being a former Chinese spy, for example, is basically a red herring; it is quickly forgotten, and does not meaningfully impact our understanding of the character. However, there is a more charitable reading. Given the nature of their work, the fact that Kishimoto and Kyuki spend so much time distrusting each other is a necessary tactic and provides one of the film’s criticisms: in this business, people are forced to assume the worst in each other. Of course, accusations of treason are gravely serious, and the fact that the film introduces such political topics and simply does not have time to explore them any further is mildly frustrating at best. The film simply has too many moving pieces for its own good.\n\nI always say a good ending can go a long way, and that’s true of *I Will Buy You*. Despite the reservations I have with the film, all of its moving pieces are arranged in such a way to execute a searing conclusion. It builds to a knockout ending with a simple but memorable closing shot. The true nature of one particular character is finally revealed, and it’s a slow realization that earns the film’s cynical reputation. It’s the ultimate “I got mine” plot twist. This does, however, make a subplot involving Kurita’s brothers turning on each other and eventually trying to kill each other feel redundant. Greed makes monsters of us all, but this transformation is obvious and cartoonish and lacks the soul-shattering cynicism of the surrounding scenes.\n\nAlso, despite my reservations, *I Will Buy You* is an engaging film. Matsuyama still manages a nuanced exploration of his themes and Kobayashi directs the action with an assured hand. There is a shot near the end with characters individually framed within doorways, or between support columns, that anticipates the rigorously angular, geometric visuals seen in films like *Samurai Rebellion*. The shot employs multiple visual planes and frames within frames, with characters moving through spaces in the foreground and background, emphasizing emotional distance. This style is also evident in the two shots below.\n\nHere, the geometric patterns of the interior space create visual boundaries between each character. Kurita, fittingly, is framed in a doorway, set against the backdrop of the next room on the right; throughout the film, he is physically present in scenes while his mind is elsewhere. Most strikingly, Fueko sits outside of this space, seen through the window on the left, and never crosses over into the room, but stands at the boundary. Fueko has no direct role in this drama; the other characters are locked in a struggle with each other, each hoping to secure their futures, but Fueko is always outside, observing them and judging them, seeing through their duplicitous machinations.\n\nThis style is evident throughout *I Will Buy You,* if not as developed or pronounced as in Kobayashi’s later films. But that’s what makes the film of particular interest for Kobayashi fans. It’s a strong early effort, a notable stepping stone in his dramas and the overall development of his aesthetic, which will soon result in his most celebrated films of the sixties. *I Will Buy You*, which was released in 1956, is not as good as the films that will follow, but it’s worth seeking out.",

It reminded me of Tarkovsky in the manner he approaches these vignettes and moments in time, often in ‘surrealistic’ fashion. Tarkovsky once said, that the only films he was interested in seeing were those of Bergman, Bresson, or Kurosawa, and has confessed his admiration for him many a time. I don’t know if they ever met, but I smile to think of the two old masters chatting about their dreams in life and cinema. \n\nThe peach orchard doll dance is one of the greatest things ever put to celluloid. Very rarely does one come across scenes so mystical, hypnotizing, magical, just overall fantastic. I felt the wonder of a child, like the young Kurosawa in the film marveling at the marriage of sound and image. Truly superb.\n\nAll of the dreams are excellently realized. The way Kurosawa manages to evoke mood through image, is magnificent. Take The Blizzard dream for example. With no words, no music, just the hunched over forms slowly treading through the grey, their gasps and moans all we hear along with the cold wind, Kurosawa perfectly evokes feeling. Words aren’t necessary. \n\nAll in all, just an amazing film, so glad I  finally came around to watching it. It appropriately feels like the final work of one of the greatest cinematic minds ever. I hope I can see it on the big screen one day! \n\n",

The emotional thrill he creates through the hopes and interactions of lonely lives is singular for me. When I consider the consistency with which he's instilled great, redemptive empathy; the amount of times he's renewed my sense of humanity, so that after viewing a film of his, I turn to the world again with an invigorated sense of the value and vitality of every person I see, I must consider him, by some private definition at least, my favorite director.",

        "text": "Nostalgia is defined as a sentimental longing or wistful affection for a period in the past. When it comes to movies, there are countless films from our youth and childhood years that are dear to our hearts. When we remember them it can fill us with feelings of pleasure as we remember memories we associate with the movies, which usually are the movies themselves. \n\nWhen you revisit them, however, it’s not uncommon to be flabbergasted at how at how poor the acting is, how outdated the effects are or how cheesy the whole thing is. Yes, once our nostalgia glasses smash we can see that many of the movies we treasured are nowhere near as good as we thought they were.  \n\nIt’s interesting, isn’t it, how the movies themselves haven’t changed? They never change. It’s us that change. We grow up. We gain new experiences. And our experience in life shape us and can change how we approach a movie. A movie that you loved once, through no change of the movie itself, you might despise revisiting it years later. A character you looked up to, you might now see where his nemesis is coming from. They always say, don’t they, how a sign of growing up is that you stop supporting Jerry and can now see why Tom is so annoyed at him. \n\nSo many different things can affect our enjoyment of a movie, from what mood we were in when we watched it, how old we were, who we watched it with, whether we saw it and gave ourselves time to absorb it or watched it as part of a marathon, so many things. And one of those things that evokes a sentimental memory-trip to a time when we innocent and free, is having watched the movie during our youth. And even if we become more knowledgeable in film later on, the movie still hold a special place in our heart.\n\nI think, also, it works the other way too. I’m noticing more and more movies that I’ve seen years ago that I was either indifferent to, or downright hated. There are many different reasons we can attribute to this. One is that as you go on in life your taste changes and it just happens that this movie resonates with you now, it could be that because you’ve seen it already you adjust your expectations, it could be that your experiences in life allow you to bond with the film so now that annoying cheesy romance subplot is something you now find endearing, or perhaps because you’ve got more experience with movies you appreciate it when things are well crafted.\n\nI started thinking about this after recently seeing Gladiator for the first time in years. When I first saw it, which was yonks ago but not during my childhood years, I thought it was great. I really enjoyed it. Good swords and scandals movie, macho, good music. It was really good.\n\nWhen I saw it recently I was floored by how well made and engaging it was. Everything about it from the effects to the production designs to the blocking and the pacing. It was such a magnificent package, a perfect film. And I thought to myself, why didn’t I give the film this much credit the first time I saw it. Sure I’ve seen a lot of movies since and might now have a more acquired taste but you can flip that argument on its head and say since I’ve seen so much more movies since I could easily have been sanitised and therefore unimpressed by Gladiator’s main feats. \n\nI also saw a couple of other movies after many years, films I was unimpressed with like Predator 2 and Die Hard 2: Die Harder. Predator 2 felt like it was made by someone overdosed on coke and Die Hard 2 was a mediocre forgettable action flick wedged in between two classics in the genre.\n\nBut again, revisiting these films, whilst not necessarily making me love them, has made me appreciate them a lot more. I found myself engrossed in the opening LA shootout of Predator 2, smiling at the charm and likability of Willis in Die Hard 2. Why though? \n\nI think the reason is, when you look at all three movies there is a clear link – they’re all action movies. And my relationship with action cinema is a strained one. I absolutely love many 80s and 90s action films, films like Robocop, Lethal Weapon, Predator, Aliens, Rambo, Police Story, Commando, Escape from New York, 48 Hours, The Matrix, Hard Boiled etc When the likes of Predator 2 and Die Hard 2 are pitted against these films, it’s easy to see why I didn’t think much of them when I first watched them.\n\nBut in modern times, I have to be honest and say I find the vast majority of 21st action films to be trash. There are a few gems here and there, and recently there has been a small wave of terrific ones such as Fury Road, John Wick 2 and The Raid pictures, but overall I’m watching modern action films trying to work out what the heck is going on with all the shakey cam, shaking my head at the CGI blood effects, dozing off because of the protagonists void of charisma and they are just so boring. So I think what it is is that I grew up watching 80s action cinema, being indifferent to the likes of Die Hard 2 because they are no match for movies like The Killer and The Terminator, but now after having watched so many modern day action films and becoming used to them, when I go back and revisit “mediocre” 80s action films, I end up really liking them because the style, which includes clear vivid action, squibs, R rated content etc is something that resonates with me. \n\nAnyway I know I’m rambling here but I think the lesson learned here is this is less to do with nostalgia and more to the fact that I think you can pretty much enjoy, dare I say it, almost ANY movie (unless it personally offends you) providing your circumstances are in such a way that you end up enjoying it. Don’t dismiss movies you once hated, I guess, is the message to myself and all film fans. \n",

I realized that I just don't like The Last Jedi.

I know plenty of black movie fans who didn't like the de-emphasization of Finn and his inconsistent and goofy character.\n\nI just... he's kind of just rubbing me the wrong way lately.  But I still really like a lot of his works, like his column about the late-90s and about Marvel's heroes and the fact that they don't learn anything from their stubbornness and arrogance.  \n\nI like Devin Feraci, but... it's a little problematic at the moment.  \n\nWhat about those of you out there?
