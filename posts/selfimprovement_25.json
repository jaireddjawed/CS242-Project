        "text": "Hello!\n\nI am 23 years old, and I just moved to Atlanta from NJ to live with my boyfriend. Our relationship is great, and we are really happy together. My job is great, I’m allowed to work remotely. So overall I am super grateful. But I can’t help but feel like I’m not established here. Of course, because I’m not yet. I just moved here 2 months ago. But it’s really been taking a toll on me mentally, and I truly like to maintain a positive mindset most of the time.\n\nI don’t know anyone here that I feel close to besides my boyfriend. I love him so much and that wasn’t meant to sound like a complaint. But, at the same time I am not a codependent person, I need my independence, which is why I’ve been struggling so much. I don’t have my car, and I can’t drive his car because of his insurance policy. And he’s very busy at work so I feel bad asking him to drive me places when he can, but throughout the day he definitely can’t because of meetings and such. So, I just feel kind of stuck. I go on walks, I Uber to my workout classes and go to the gym to keep busy aside from work. \n\nMy boyfriends best friend lives down here, so he has his sense of camaraderie. I tried being friends with his girlfriend, but she doesn’t really care for me, which sucks, because I really am so nice to her.. but.. I digress. I do always try hard to make friends with his friends/mutual friends to connect with a larger community, but it’s just not working. They’re all a bit older than me, around 27-35 years old and I guess hanging out with a 23 year old isn’t that enticing. Making friends as an adult isn’t that easy I guess? I don’t know. I’ve never made friends outside of school/work. I’ve also had forever-friends since middle school. But now they’re in another state. So I just feel like I need to branch out more.\n\nIn terms of developing healthier habits to get my mind/body/spirit right: I stopped drinking alcohol. I have been working out and losing weight. My relationship is great. Job is great. So, I think the drastic adjustment to moving to a new city, not having access to go places without my car and not knowing really anyone has been taking its toll on me. I just feel like I have anywhere to go or anything to do. Purpose is really important to me and I feel like I’ve been lacking it maybe?\n\nSo if you read this far, thank you for reading my ramble, and I hope it doesn’t sound like I’m complaining up a storm, because I am excited for this new lifestyle switch-up and growing personally and together with my boyfriend. \n\nIf you have any advice, insight or personal growth/self-improvement strategies on how to work through this mental/emotional rut, and adjusting to a new city please please please help! Genuinely appreciated, and much needed right now.",

I have no clue how to make money, and i have waisted most of my 20s playing video games, eating shit food, smoking weed, staying up till 5 am and regretting my life choices. at this moment in my life im actually in a privileged position that i don't even deserver to be in, i earn enough to live comfortably and i don't have any debt but at the cost of not having time chase any of my passions as work take up all of my day.\n\nI was raised in a very poor house hold by a single mom who abused me as a child so i when i left home to live with my gf i kinda fell in to a spiral of self pity and self sabotage and now I'm afraid its to late to get back on track and one day be a great man and have kids that are proud to have me as a dad. i have dropped the weed and im trying to get the mental fortitude to get my drivers license and also join a gym but i have no clue how to attain some financial freedom, i have about 2.5k euros saved up in my account im not a big spender but i have no clue how to manage and make money, its been years since i went to a doctor appointment and every time i get sick i get scared and think it might be cancer or something that will be the end of me. and i know i should just go to the doctor but i cant find it in me to just do it, i know it sounds stupid but unless i have to go to emergency services i just don't do it.\n\nI'm trying to take steps to better my life but in all honesty i feel lost and empty i have no propose of living everything just feels meaningless and some days i wish a car would not stop at the red light and just run me over. i offer no value to society nor do i feel im needed (my gf is actually very supportive of me but idk how long that will last if i stay this way). I never had masculine figure that could teach me the ways and so i was always behind when it comes to social interactions and dealing with women. even in this post i wrote many times \"i feel\" and that's how i carried my life instead of taking action i sat down and waited till i \"felt\" i was in the mood, spoiler i was never in the mood for anything. I'm terrefraid of confrontations no matter the nature, i always make myself small as to not call attention to myself. I feel emasculated, not worth as man, hell sometimes I'm even ashamed to be a man as i am making our gender a disservice just by existing.\n\nI'm sorry this post is all over the place, i guess what I'm trying to say is i need help as a 27 year old male who doesn't have any kind of goals in life and is just a ghost in the shell who goes to work and gets home to brainless play video games all night. i want to make money and attain financial independence i want to start my own thing and be proud of it and one day have kids and i want them to be proud of me as a dad im tired of living life on autopilot as a npc daydreaming living in my own head. I want to love living again i want to build something so that one day i can have kids and they don't have to go trough the same struggles as me, i want to be inspiring to people, i want to be a man that people are proud to have as a friend, i want to be able provide for my gf and myself.\n\nIf anyone here is able to relate or comprehend where I'm at now please help i keep searching online but im so tired of the \"gurus\" and motivational speakers, i just want something that i can do now to make things better, i want to have mental fortitude to go trough with things, i don't want to be afraid of discomfort anymore and i want to get out of my safe zone without having anxiety attacks.\n\nSo if you reading this and have some life or financial advice for me please help me, I'm turning 28y this year and if i let things go on like these in five years from now ill be more miserable and much older.\n\nps. I'm from europe if that helps with anything",

The path isn't 1 day long, it will take some time\n\nWhy I'm thinking about \"giving up\" on the goal: I have a well-built routine (I have been improving it for 2 years). It includes fitness, daily goals in my \"businesses\", overall self-improvement (learning new things in my fields). Also, it's easier to focus on improving today's day rather than thinking about how long is the road to my goal\n\nIf you achieved your dream life, tell me what do you think about this",

I have been told in the past when I was a kid that I am gifted but why do I feel like it takes sooooo long for me to catch on to even the simple things??? I can’t even be a server… I am too forgetful and I don’t retain information the same way other adults my age do…. I’ve been told that I am a very creative person and that I am a talented at makeup but there’s always someone much better. I want to be one of the best and be able to learn advanced information and skills at a fast pace, because that’s what society requires, and I want nothing more than to be confident in my talents, my accomplishments and the way that I look. I want to be an extremely above average, distinguished, highly creative, eccentric person. It takes a LOT to make me happy and for me, living a luxury life in a big city and getting to high achievement status with little to no help from others is extremely important to me… and I am so desperately afraid that I don’t have the brain capacity to reach an advanced level… am I just being hard on myself? Does anyone else have this problem, if so, how did you reach advancement? Do i have mental retardation?? I don’t know…. Am I actually highly intelligent and just have some kind of learning disability or something??? Or are my expectations for myself so unhealthily high that it’s inhibiting my learning because I give up too quickly?? Does anyone have any advice for me?",

        "author": "FantasticDelivery777",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/118hfdu/breaking_free_from_selfimposed_prisons_a_guide_to/",
        "text": "Breaking free from self-imposed prisons can be a life-changing experience, allowing individuals to live a life that is free from limiting beliefs, negative thoughts and behaviors, or toxic relationships. The journey towards breaking free can be difficult, but the end result is worth it. To help individuals on their journey, the following are several important steps that can be taken towards breaking free from self-imposed prisons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Identifying What is Holding You Back: The first step towards breaking free from self-imposed prisons is to identify what is holding you back. This requires self-reflection and honesty. To begin, ask yourself what beliefs, thoughts, or behaviors are limiting your potential. This can involve exploring past experiences and traumas, examining your thought patterns, and considering any fears or insecurities that hold you back. When you have identified what is holding you back, you can take steps to challenge and overcome these limiting factors.\n2. Setting Clear Goals and Intentions: Once you know what is holding you back, you can set goals that align with your values and purpose. Goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Writing down your goals and visualizing yourself achieving them can help you stay motivated and on track. It is important to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve and why. This will help you stay focused and motivated, even when the journey gets difficult.\n3. Surrounding Yourself with Positive, Supportive People: The people in your life can have a significant impact on your happiness and success. Seek out relationships with individuals who support and encourage you, and limit your time with those who bring negativity and drama into your life. Consider finding a mentor or joining a support group to help you on your journey. Having a supportive network of individuals who believe in you and your goals can provide motivation and encouragement when you need it most.\n4. Taking Action Towards Your Goals: Setting goals is one thing, but taking action and working towards achieving them is another. Start small and build momentum. Don't be afraid of failure - instead, view it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may be. Taking consistent action towards your goals will help you break free from your self-imposed prison and achieve the life you desire.\n5. Practicing Self-Care and Self-Compassion: Taking care of yourself is crucial when breaking out of a self-imposed prison. This includes physical self-care (such as exercise and proper nutrition), emotional self-care (such as journaling and therapy), and mental self-care (such as meditation and mindfulness). It's important to be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion. Forgive yourself for mistakes and don't be too hard on yourself. Taking care of yourself will give you the energy and strength to keep pushing forward and achieve your goals.\n6. Embracing Change and Adapting to New Experiences: Breaking out of a self-imposed prison requires stepping out of your comfort zone and embracing change. This can be scary, but it is essential for growth. Seek out new experiences and be open-minded to new ideas. Take calculated risks and trust yourself. Embracing change can help you break free from limiting beliefs and negative thought patterns, and allow you to grow and evolve as a person.\n7. Celebrating Your Accomplishments and Progress: Celebrating your progress and acknowledging your hard work and achievements is an important step towards breaking free from self-imposed prisons. Recognizing your successes will give you the confidence to keep pushing forward and help you stay motivated on your journey. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may be, as this will help you appreciate your journey and the hard work you have put in.\n\nBreaking free from self-imposed prisons is a process that takes time, patience, and perseverance. It is important to focus on taking small steps and staying committed to your goals. Surround yourself with positive people, take care of yourself, and embrace change. By following these steps, you can break free from your self-imposed prison and live the life you were meant to live. Remember, the journey may be difficult, but the end result is worth it. So, be patient, stay committed, and never give up on yourself.\n\nWhat limiting beliefs, negative thoughts, or toxic relationships are holding you back from achieving your goals and living the life you desire?

        "text": "Post is a question and a vent.\n\nquestion first, vent below:  \nhow to stop being jealous in relationship ?\n\nI don't have insecurities or logical reason to believe my SO would cheat, but the feeling still comes when she's not with me. And since it's not logical, I don't see a logical way to deal with this, so I end up spying to check on her (no I'm not proud of it). How can I stop having these painful feelings, or manage them, in order to stop spying and feel in peace ?  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is the long vent+story, mixed together:\n\n  \nI (M 25) have a past of being cheated on.  Since it was quite displeasing, I think I grew very defensive on the matter. The problem: My now girlfriend (F 27) of 1+ year is pretty. As such, she has a tendency to get approached, sometime VERY openly by guys. When she's out without me (only then), I'm getting jealous beyond any common measure.\n\nI know it's an issue I have, so I'm doing extreme effort to not control her and to prevent it from affecting our relationship. She never complained or said anything about me being jealous, so I think I'm doing fine for that part.\n\n  \nBut to be honest on this anonymous space, I hate this part of me. The feeling is painful, and the action it made me do also. Worst I've done was to follow her into a club without her knowing, that's when I understood I had a big problem. I confess that sometimes I still can't resist the urge to check her phone. The thing is, the jealousy is too strong, and I don't know another way to make it pass.  Checking her phone relieves the pain, and telling myself afterwards \"I'm a stupid paranoid fuck\"+ the guilt of invading her space, is still better than to try to restrict her liberty, which is something I would never do. \n\nOn the other hand, I found so many terrible things, I think it's also feeding the jealousy. I once caught a message from an old friend of her who said he \"wanted to fuck her so bad it'll end In the hospital\"(his words). She reprimanded him for this, but they are still talking. She never told me and acts like it never happened. \n\nI dislike that she doesn't tell me about all the flirting she receives, but I think I'd become mad if she did. I also dislike that she is not so virulent in pushing guys away, but she never did anything with any of them. \n\nStill, the feeling is present, and it's painful. I'm very motivated to get beyond it, but I'm lost on how to go with it. I'm currently on waiting list for therapy, but I don't know if it will help",

short period of time, it takes too long to be back on track.\n\nAnd the more you gave up the more you lose faith at yourself, self-esteem, and gain more doubts which burden your mind functionality efficiently to excel life, and overcome depression.\n\nby experience the whole mind matrix built by you, you will find the supported unreal chaos and the thought supporting it along.\n\nFinally, you need to analyze your actions and reactions then same for parties before you made any decisions get you back to this mind matrix, and if you are surrounded by toxic communities then it’s the best time to leave for good.\n\nYou aren’t alone and life challenges will level you up the more you get matured but it’s vital to learn the lessons and gain the experience beyond to mitigate its occurrence till it fades out.\n\n**Avoid complaining and butting blames and start moving forward**\n\nthe brain structure is sophisticated and every part is essential specially 3 glands which are responsible for body healing, foresight, detection, and mind orders to other organs.\n\nHypothalamus: to detect objects, measures, pictures, smells, other individuals, and places.\n\nCerebrum: for thinking, boost what you experience to other mind structure, and short memory.\n\nCerebellum: in other words, “The Pinal gland” to heal other parts of body, long memory recalls, and creativity.\n\nOnce any one experience any embarrassment along his way he/she will be distracted by irrelevant and not reliable thoughts and will affect the hypothalamus and it’s the first gland functions at the conscious state of mind, and the other glands will be affected like hypothalamus gland hence ruin the mind functionality, and structure.\n\nAnd at this state the brain will be bombarded by un real thoughts and delusions, and it’s the best place for chaos, to un projected blames and complains without a valid base.\n\nPutting blames on people even if they have their part of your story will lead to miss and self-bias, and the parties on your story will start to deliver hard times with a higher dosage even if they didn’t intend to deliver it in the first place.\n\nMost of the major disorders are based on un projected thoughts by the psychotic individual which get bigger by time, increase delusions, and problems along, hence off tracks, instead of finding a reliable resolution.\n\n**Choose your battles or it will choose you**\n\nNot all what is surrounding you should irritate you, as based on the human nature once people notice a change or any breakthrough they will find a way or another to stop it or waste it.\n\nYou might be facing struggles now which isn’t yours, and people won’t stop unless you ignore, and be out numbered from toxic environments, and act in smart way for your own.\n\nToxic people usually are trying to be the smartest ones on the room as they are attention seekers, who are trying to get you delayed on what you are up to regardless the value of it.\n\nToxic communities only gain by delaying or pushing creative people and doers to their negative vortexes and they don’t like to see change taking place.\n\n**It’s better to determine all the below before taking actions:**\n\nWho you are?\n\nWhere you stand?\n\nWhat are your aims?\n\nWhen to react, and whom you react with, and why you are reacting?\n\n**Start to move forward and act instead of seeking validation from fake refries:**\n\nThroughout your path if you are looking for a stop you will have hundreds.\n\nAlways keep your good vibes regardless surrounding environments as its essential to end what you have started, because if you are looking forward to prove any for clumsy aggressors by time you will be lost at worthless confusions and end up to be their puppet who burnout to gain their validation.\n\n**Conclusion: it’s important to know when to accept, reject, and follow the lead:**\n\nLife will get you into many good and bad scenarios, and feeling drained or humiliated is natural feelings but you have the control on the time you experience it.\n\nIf you felt being a victim and looking for drama it will lead to distractions, low self-confidence at handling, and will enrich your soul with sorrow and disappointments, and the thrill will be lost for good things even.\n\nSaying no is quite important like saying yes, so be aware of what you need in the first place and reject what is not leading to your aims, and follow what you want to attract.\n\nIf you are consumed at the wrong place, then you are the one who lose and keep losing unless you move on.",

I’ve made some cards which have prompts, conversation or exercises which I’m using to help me become more confident speaking to strangers. Today’s prompt was **‘Ask a stranger how their day is going’**\n\n**Before:**\n\nI’ve been doing this for a while so it’s a lot less intimidating. At the start of this experiment, the idea of start a conversation from cold was so intimidating but now I’ve done it a few times, it’s almost second nature to be looking for conversations and opportunities to speak with people.\n\n**Experience:**\n\nI was waiting for a train this morning and saw a girl my age. I think before I would have gone into my own world but I swallowed my anxiety (or as much as I could muster) and said ‘Good Morning, How’s your day going’ which opened up a nice conversation.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThe more I do this, the less intimidating it is, the better I get at it and the more satisfying it is. I’m almost looking forward to the harder challenges I’ve set myself in the future which is fascinating given a week ago, the idea of starting a conversation with someone would have made me a nervous wreck.\n\nI'm also really glad I've made it process orientated and slowly driven up the difficulty instead of making it an unsurmountable task, it feels like a steady progression which I can hang on to.\n\n**If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.**",

        "text": "One of the biggest traps I see people fall into is starting and moving down the self-improvement journey for the wrong reasons. Many people think that they need to be doing a version of self-improvement to fit a certain \"image\" that society presents for them. Or they want to impress a group of people or that girl you like.\n\nForget all that. \n\nThis journey is about YOU and YOU only. I see alot of sentiment about how self-improvement is our own personal responsibility. That is true, and at the same time, you're the number one beneficiary of the results you put in.\n\nI recently got inspired to make this post because at the beginning of the year my boss told our team he wanted to know all our personal goals at some point. Well, screw him (my boss is a manipulative prick so no I won't share with him). I'm certainly NOT doing this for him, and he doesn't get to benefit from any moves I make. \n\nWhatever results you gain out of self-improvement benefits everyone else secondarily and collaterally. If your loved ones and family benefit from your progress, that is wonderful, but at the end of the day, you're the one that putting in the heavy lifting and setting the stage to receive the fruits of your labor. That's why it's called SELF improvement, not community improvement. \n\nAt the end of the day, remember you aren't doing this for anyone EXCEPT you. Not your parents. Not your spouse, not society.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1187bp9/the_art_of_self_awareness/",
        "text": " \n\nSelf-awareness seems self-explanatory right? It’s being aware of our emotions so we know how to respond to a situation. While this may be easy to understand, it can be difficult to master if we don’t practice it. It’s a skill we acquire with experience to become better at decision making and be able to build confidence. To be aware is to understand how we are feeling and how to practice power over our emotions. This could be simply daily practices in checking in with ourselves by asking; How does my body feel? What is my current emotion? Does this current emotion serve any purpose?\n\nHow often do we check in with ourselves matters as we tend to feel different emotions daily and we can carry the same emotions day to day from traumatic experiences or situations we refuse to accept. Often, we don’t consider the magnitude of our emotions until we are at a point of emotional duress and we are looking for an out. We should understand our emotions and the impact on our body before they manifest to the point where we feel we have no control. It can take longer to undue the emotional damage from an experience than the experience itself.\n\nSelf-awareness is of course something we should practice every day. Knowing how we feel internally and the impact it has our body will allow us to better handle stressful situations and allow growth within. We can break down self-awareness in two categories, internal and external. Internal self-awareness refers to how we see ourselves, what drives us, our feelings, thoughts, weakness, reactions, values, etc. This is where we try to understand ourselves and the motivation for doing the things we do.\n\nThe simplest way to understand ourselves is to do a self-reflection. Everything around us is a reflection ourselves, our friends, relationship, families, job, hobbies, etc. Everything that we allow in our daily lives and routine is part us because we are making the choice to wake up and surround ourselves with certain individuals and partake in activities that we find pleasurable. When we do a self-reflection, we should be honest with ourselves and understand that everything around us is something we attracted and contributed to. Everything around us is a creation of ourselves. We may believe that some of our friends are completely different from us, but we have something in common with everyone in our lives and that’s usually similar beliefs. You may have the same money habits, same traumatic experiences, same emotional griefs, same values, ect. Once we can understand that we are the marker of our lives, we can have better control to create a life that we really want.\n\nThe amygdala was the first part of the brain to develop in humans. The primary role of the amygdala is the processing of memory, decision making and emotional responses. This part of the brain is skilled at anticipating danger before we know what we feeling. When we anticipate danger our heart races, stomach tightens and our muscle can tense up. We tend to feel a physical response before we can name the emotion. If you can bring awareness to your physical self, you can recognize the current emotion as it is happening.\n\nExternal self-awareness refers to how others view us, do our views fit with what others see? External self-awareness goes beyond appearing to be liked by others to question if we have disproportion views of ourselves. This is breaking the barrier from what we think and how others view us. We can do this by assessing ourselves, and stepping outside ourselves and pretending we are other people. How would the interaction go? How might we feel about ourselves if we were a fly in the wall? This is in essence understanding what we are doing to contribute to people’s belief about us.\n\nIn the route of self-awareness is experience. Learning from our past is critical because this is what shapes us to be the person we are today and what decisions we are likely to make in the future. This mean learning from our mistakes, where we can assess the situation and make factual decisions not quick decisions based on emotions. We don’t what our future will look like if we make a certain decision vs. the other. We can give it our best guess but realistically what we think, doesn’t often happen because our emotions are often being driven by fear and not by facts.\n\nWith experience, this is teaching us to be honest with our selves where we are ruling our false information, where we are not filtering information that only suits us. Think of your brain as a tape recorder, everything you learn is being stored and the tape recorder is consistency being edited. What differs every individual is how use store information we learn and how we interpret it. I often say, that a group of people could be in a room, witness the same thing but everyone is going to have a different experience because our experiences has shaped us to interpret situations a certain way.\n\nSelf-awareness teaches us to that a negative emotion, attitude we have been inviting is only danger to ourselves and we will continue to attract similar scenarios if we don’t shift our focus and thoughts. The more we continue to tide ourselves to a certain belief that favors us, the longer we are stuck in the past because we will continue to attract situations that confirm our beliefs. We don’t often stop and think why we keep attracting the same circumstances, because it easier to blame others than is it to change. Once we have truly master self-awareness, we no longer have a limiting belief, we no longer blame others for our problems, we more are able to work towards personal goals without the emotional blockage and have the power to influence outcomes.",

Learn to laugh your embarrassing moments off and avoid looking nervous/embarrassed.  \n\n\n2) BE PRESENT- Avoid being a silly pooch and try to stay attentive for most of the time spent in public/with people. This habit can also save you from someone bullying/poking fun at you, do not be the laughing stock in those moments and try to find a way out. You'll actually end up impressing everyone.  \n\n\n3) LEARN TO TAKE JOKES AND RETURN THEM TOO- If someone mocks you, you should lightly return some heat back. If you are not very quick with words then you should laugh it off and avoid looking hurt or embarrassed.  \n\n\n4) RIGHT TIME RIGHT ACTIVITIES- Pretty self explanatory. Don't be a goofball at serious moments and serious at joyful moments.  \n\n\n5) SELF DEPENDENCY  \n\n\n6) BE RESPONSIBLE  \n\n\n7) DON'T BE HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY ANYONE- Especially your \"friends\". Do what you actually want and what you think is correct. Ex- Don't try alcohol because it seems cool. Don't go to the bar when you shouldn't be going just because your \"friends\" asked you to come.  \n\n\n8) BE CONFIDENT IN PUBLIC- Boosts your performance, especially sports.  \n\n\n9) CHEER FOR YOUR FRIENDS IN PUBLIC: This habit will absolutely boost your friends confidence and make you a stronger and better team. It also encourages the rest of the audience to cheer  \n\n\n10) PROVE YOUR WORTH- Avoid being easily replaceable   \n\n\n11) AVOID BEING VULNERABLE AGAINST NON- TRUSTWORTHY PEOPLE- It will most definitely backfire\n\n \n\n12) DO NOT ACT BUTTHURT- Even if a statement/joke in public bothers you, do not get butthurt instantly. Be reasonable and assertive while countering if you do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n13) LEARN HOW TO WIN- You absolutely instinctively know how to win.

        "text": "Using throwaway account becouse I am ashamed of myself..\n\nHighschool\nI graduated high school in 2020, we had quarantine, which was the BEST thing ever for me.\nHigh school was kinda defestating for me, I am otherwise super talkative, but always shy when talking to new people. For some reason in elementary school, people liked me, even through I gave absolutely no shit, they came to me and I made alot of friends effortlessly. This didn't came in high school, but eventually everyone makes friends. I decieded that I want some people around me and it worked out, from 9th grade to 11st grade, I made a very good friend group cosisting of 5 people, including myself, I was super happy. This started to decline in 11st grade, when alcohol came in, they became addicted, I didn't like the taste of it, they stopped inviting me to events, they stopped talking to me much, they made friends with the \"popular\" people in the class, whose didn't really like me for some reason, but the last nail in the coffin was a crush of mine. I was in love with her since elementary school (dont do this people, confess fast, dont torment yourselves), and I finally got the nerves, after befriending her best-friends, and they cheered me up, to ask her out on a date. Sadly I did it texting, since she was socially awkward and didn't go anywhere and there was no school, it was start of summer. She didn't even check my messege on messenger, whole fucking summer, I was waiting for her to atleast check on me, but nothing. \nSchool started, I got to her and asked what happened, she was making excuses and I got pretty depressed over the summer, so it continued in the school, since I saw her everyday. Cherry on the top, prom was coming, and my old BEST friends, invited my old crush to dance, she ofc said yes becouse that's how life is. Prom was the living hell for me. My old best friend then asked her on a date but she was an asshole to him as well, so we kinda started talking again, but not for long.\n\nUNIVERSITY\n\nHuge mistake, I started studying something I didn't like. I was quite popular in university, highschool was the hell for me, so I started improving on how to make university the living dream, and for some time it actually worked. I made like 10 friends-like relations, I could always go out with ppl, we went on trips, just having beers, inviting more people, talking late night about dreams. It was the living dream, 2020 and 2021 was the best. \nI also befriended a girl and a guy, who stayed with me all the way to 2023, but I'll get to this. So in 2021 september, I realised I don't like Meteorology, so I left, at the point I left, my friend count decreased from around 9 people I could talk to and get answer right away to THREE. Yes, after leaving uni only three people continued to talk to me. Feels very bad for my self esteem. By the end of 2022, only two stayed with me, a guy who I considered until nowadays my best friend, and the girl I befriended at the start of the first semester on a trip. I started having a crush on this girl when we were at her place in new year. She is SUPER INTO natural science, like it's her life, she loves it so much. I left the university which taught me nature science, so it made me on a disadvantage when talking to her. My \"best friend\" is also good friends with this girl since they are classmates, and he also has a girlfriend, who is yet again one of the girl's best friends.\nWe talked about this crush thing alot with those two in january, and eventually convinced me to confess in february. She said no.\nI wasn't as much devestated as in my highschool love, since she was super polite, but we talked about we are going to cut eachother for a time, until this crush thing fades away. Lost one of my best friends, she was always there when I was in bad mood, she always asked whats up, even through I wasnt studying the same thing for a long time, lost one of my greatest friends, due to an unfortunate crush, which I never had before on her... Fine, I still have my best friend and his gf right? Yeah....We talked about meeting up more often, usually we hang out one or two times/ month, they are super busy with uni, it's super hard what they do, trust me, but we always talked on Teams and messenger. So we meet two weeks ago, it was super refreshing, we were only as 3, we had laughs, talked about things we never did before, etc, we were out the whole afternoon and night, it was great. Ever since then, he stopped answering my messeges, literally not even clicking on them. I don't know what happened. We talked alot on that hang out about talking more often, HE suggested that we can even play sometimes, he will call me on teams, etc... He completly ignores me. He is online but ignores my messeges. I think I lost my best friend? I honestly don't know what happened. He already did this once, and I ofc forgived him, but dunno if it's the right thing now that he does this, in this times of my life.\n\nI am literally having worse time than when I was waiting for my crush's messege on summer. I know I have friends that don't give a heck about me, I know that I lost a great friend due to a stupid crush, I know that I wasted 2 years of my life doing this university, even through I never had hang-out friends back in the days, I always had the \"boyz\", who with I could play on late nights, afternoons videogames. They are no longer there either. I am completly alone, the only people I can talk to is my mother and my brother and his girlfriend.\n\nI start my new university in september, which is still a SUPER LONG TIME. What can I do? I feel so bad, I feel my best friend failed at the friend test, leaving me when I am at my worst, I love him and my crush's friendship more than anything, never enjoyed hanging out more than with them and I miss them so much. I miss my gaming buddies, I miss everyone I grew apart in the years.\n\nI befriended nowadays, since we had the same huge interest in tornadoes, and we talked for 2 days, it was amazing, thought I finally found someone new. It was a week ago, ever since he also stopped answering me and ignores me on messenger. I try not to be too clingy, but I want to share everything with him, when I am researching HOURS on some old ass thunderstorm, which I know he is interested in, also I was, we could talk about it, but he just ignores me, leaves me on read. I don't know what happened again, what did I do wrong.\nThe last cup of tea was my Sister's boyfriend. He and me are literally the same, so we get along super well. So recently we talked as people of three (me, sister and his bf) and me and his bf got into a really good conservation, which lasted for like an hour, my sister then had a tantrum, or how do I call it, and asked his BF to stop talking to me, becouse she doesn't want me to be his best friend. So now I also can't talk to them as well. \n\nIt feels like I am getting constantly slapped by the World for some reason and I get depressed to the way I just leave home at some random times and don't get home till many hours pass. I did this last night, and it made my mom devastated, which also devestated me, so I am not doing this anymore. Lost my suicidal thoughts and this \"going out alone\" shit, becouse I know how much it hurts her, so sometimes I am just laying in my bed, thinking about why did all this happen to me, when I was super kind to everyone, always there when help was needed, never wanted money for the help I did, correpetated people who were bad at maths, english, etc FOR FREE for hours, becosue they were my \"friends\" and all I got was everyone leaving me, and only one of them told me the truth why he doesnt talk to me much anymore. All the other just kept saying excuses when I tried to talk about this seriously. I feel like I am worthless at this point. Feels bad watching my sibling moving forward in life, while I am stuck, feeling bad I am alone at my worst, and when life gives me new people to talk to, they suddenly get away in one way or other (like my sister's bf).\n\nFelt somewhat good writing this down, trying to play alone games, continue the guitar, carving, find a job, but I will still be heartbroken, and not just becouse of my crush, but becouse of all the slaps I got this month, september is still super far away.\n\nThanks for everyone reading all the way down, I know it got super long.",

        "text": "So I started Self-Improvement around September 2022 and it was great for a while. The first few months I was still learning a lot about self help and honestly I don't even remember it that well. January was really good as well. I lost all desire to play video games and jack off. I wasn't perfect at NoFap but I was consistently getting better. I got into journaling and meditating and most of all fitness. However, I feel recently I've gotten into a rut. I feel like I've been resetting all of my progress and no matter what I try it doesn't seem to be going away. I've been slipping on everything. Waking up early, meditating, going on walks, and worst of all (the main reason I feel like \\*\\*\\*\\*) NoFap. I've started playing video games again too and eating junk food which I literally did less of BEFORE starting self improvement. The only things I haven't been slipping on are staying hydrated and journaling, but those are relatively easy. To be honest I think it all stems from me being shit at NoFap. Thankfully I don't live in a place where I can access access p\\*rn without being seen, but my imagination is literally too vivid. I feel like I'm in a cycle of: jerking off --&gt; feeling like shit --&gt; going back to my other bad habits --&gt; feeling like shit --&gt; jerking off. I've tried everything, a hard 7 day dopamine detox to reset my brain but even that I failed to jerking off. Can someone please give me advice?",

I need some advice regarding a sleep routine/daily routine. \n\nA few months ago I decided I would stop going to bed at 7am and instead I wake up at that time, I took a sleeping pill and woke up at a completely different time than usual (bad idea) ended up getting really bad acne and felt really weird from doing it all at once, lesson learnt. I ended up just keep my bad sleep routine until now, now I've been ajusting my sleep routine by actually staying UP later but gradually (I was going to bed really late, like 10am, so I decided to stay up in 30 minute increments, I'm going to bed now in the afternoon and waking up around 10pm, so not there quite yet obviously, got a few more hours to adjust (maybe until 3am) and then I'll be happy.) It's been years since I've had a functioning sleep routine, how can I do this without experiencing anxiety and feeling crappy? I'm not working or in school yet. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you everyone!",

I decided to change this by sleeping at 10pm and getting up at 6am everyday. Also have my own morning routine which includes morning walk, yoga, journaling and affirmations inspired by The Morning Miracle by Hal Eldrod.\n\nJunk food to healthy food everyday. I used to binge eat junk food everyday to destress. It was my favorite hobby to eat junk food and watch my favorite show. But I realized how bad this was for my health and productivity so I decided to get rid of all the junk in my kitchen and replace it with only healthy foods such as vegetables and fruits. Also learned to make some healthy foods on my own at home. Proud to say it’s been 5–6 months since I ate junk and still going strong! Feel energized everyday.\n\nCoach potato to productive person. I used to binge watch all my favorite shows and scroll endlessly through social media ALL DAY. I realized how little fulfillment this brought me and decided to break this habit. I’ve cut out social media, limited screen time and ensure to take daily action towards my goals everyday by setting it on my calendar. I also make sure to focus on my most important tasks (MITs). I feel a sense of accomplishment, presence and peace.\n\nCoach potato to active person. Like I said, sitting around watching TV was my favorite hobby. But I felt moody and sluggish. I decided to exercise and dance as a hobby. I also do morning yoga and take daily walks outside now. I love moving around now more than ever! It makes me feel energized, refreshed, and happier.\n\nTrapped in comfort zone to escaping out of comfort zone and growing everyday. I’m a very shy person and always hated interacting with new people. I decided to tackle this obstacle and fear by making sure to reach out to new people, joining meetup groups, and connecting with past friends to get out of my comfort zone but obviously virtually for now. I even created my first YouTube channel and blog!\n\nI still feel the fear but challenging myself to step out of the comfort zone has helped me grow a lot. I’m still working on this but that’s the beauty of self improvement. It’s that it never ends. We’re always a work in progress! :)\n\nHow did this pandemic change you?

Two months ago, I've made a challenge to myself that I will keep myself from smoking for 60 days straight by making a calendar on this subreddit and editing in the days - every day - until I hit the 60th day. I would post a link to my post from two months ago, but the subreddit rules won't allow me.\n\nI'm glad to say that I'm not a smoker anymore, cigarettes are absolutely disgusting to me now, they actually started smelling awful now that I have a clear nose. The first 15 days of the challenge were the worst, and in this time span is the only time I've broken the challenge by smoking twice (one time on the 9th day, and another time on the 15th; there was one time on the second day, but I'm willing to not count that since it was still a fresh beginning and it was pure hell to stop smoking).\n\nBut after the 15th day, I've started respecting the calendar. It's a strange feeling, I would describe it close to the feeling of guilt if I even consider smoking after looking at the progress I've made on the calendar. So I've kept going and going, and by the time I've reached the 60th day, I haven't even realized it since I've lost count on which day I am of not smoking. It wasn't until the latest comment on the post asking me \"How's it going?\" that I've realized that I completed my goal!\n\nQuite strange how time works, at the start of the challenge I thought it would never end; looking back now, 2 months ago, it was the easiest thing I've ever done for such a hard habit to break. It's so easy to quit when you actually want to quit (the calendar helped a lot).\n\nAnyways, if any smokers that want to quit have any questions, feel free to ask!",

        "text": "**Big habits I'm currently trying to implement: These habits are absolutely essential and need to be performed every day in a consistent manner.**\n\n* To wake up at 8 am every day for 30 days (currently on day 30, successful 30/30 days).\n* To go to the gym 5 times per week for 30 days (currently on day 16, successful 16/16 days).\n* To perform at least 1 hour of deep work every day for 30 days (currently on day 3, successful 3/3 days).\n\n**Mini habits I'm currently trying to implement: These habits are not essential, they simply help with ones listed above. It's not a big deal if I'm inconsistent with these habits.**\n\n* To be in bed at least 8 hours before my wake up time.\n* To get ready for bed half an hour before my sleep time.\n* To take a shower first thing after waking up.\n* To write a daily post on reddit documenting my progress.\n\n**Was my day a success?**\n\nYes! Today was a success. What a month it has been. My first habit has successfully been implemented in my life. Waking up early every day was not always easy, but I'm glad I stuck with it. It has helped me in numerous ways. I woke up for the 30th day in a row at 8 am this morning!\n\nIn terms of the gym, today I worked on my back. I did deadlifts. I'm working hard on getting my form right for exercises. This is crucial for my long term success when it comes to lifting. I always feel great after my workouts. It's like I get a kick of dopamine and I'm super happy. I've been working out with a friend and that's been nice because it allows me to socialize. I'm naturally an extravert so this is good for me. One of the reasons this pandemic has been tough is because of the lack of socializing.\n\nI performed my 1 hour of deep work as well. All 3 of my big habits were successful. I worked on an exam I have coming up.\n\n**How am I feeling?**\n\nI'm feeling great! No where near burnout. I'm going to sleep happy because I know I'm working to make progress in my life, little by little. These habits might not seem huge right now, but they will have a lasting impact and will allow me to get better and better.\n\nMy overall mood was really good except around evening time. For a period of 1 hour or so I felt existential angst. But that is normal, it happens from time to time. Some of the material that I was studying (psychology) probably triggered those emotions. But it didn't last long. All emotions are normal and should not be shunned. I'm happy that my baseline level of happiness and health is quite high. Even if I get down sometimes, overall I usually feel quite good and healthy with my emotions.\n\nI'm also proud of myself because I reached out to an old friends today. We got into a fight in high school and we stopped talking a long time ago. I figured I'd bring peace to the past. I was playing a video game with some friends the other week and he was there as well, and I got the urge to say something to him today. So I messaged him and we had a nice little convo. Sometimes it's nice to go back to the past and reach out to old friends, even if things didn't work out.\n\nOn another note, I got a nice haircut the other day so I'm feeling very confident in my appearance. I usually hate posting on social media because I can get quite shy. I also don't know much about social media because I don't use it much. But I decided to post a picture of myself today and I got several compliments and people reaching out to me. That made me happy as well.\n\n**Things that I have learned throughout this self-improvement process:**\n\n* Bigger Leaner Stronger is the best book I've read on fitness.\n* When trying to fix sleep, it is far better to focus on wake up time rather than sleep time.\n* Research indicates that we should just focus on implementing 1-3 big habits at a time. 1 is best for beginners. Willpower is a limited resource.\n* The One Thing is a great book that explains the importance of just working on a few things at once.\n* Implementing a good habit can take anywhere from 21 days to several months.\n* Deep Work is a great book that explains what deep work is, and the difference between deep work and shallow work.\n* Most people can only perform a maximum of 4 hours of deep work per day. For beginners, 1 hour per day is the best place to start.\n* The Slight Edge is a great book that talks about the importance of consistency. It's hard to imagine the progress that you'll make several years from now by implementing small habits, but it will be huge.\n* Social \"pressure\" is tremendously helpful when it comes to implementing new habits. This is why writing posts on reddit about my progress every day helps with motivation and discipline. I don't want to let myself down, but I also don't want to let you guys down. Another example of this is working out with a friend.\n* Success in one area of life can weirdly result in success in other areas of life. I've noticed that fixing my sleep has oddly resulted in my ocd and tics to improve. Furthermore, I've been told that my face looks better as a result of my new sleep schedule. I look more \"awake\".\n* It's important to track how I am feeling every day because I must always be on the lookout for burnout.\n* It's important to be kind to myself. Some days my process will not be perfect. I will have inconsistencies. As long as I have good intentions, and work on fixing my mistakes, I am happy about my progress.\n* When trying to figure out what habits to work on, think of the 80/20 rule. Which ones, if correctly implemented, will have the greatest benefits in your life and allow you to more easily work on other habits in the future.\n* The 80/20 rule can also be applied to other things. For example, when performing deep work, focus on the work that is most essential.\n* Goals need to be S.M.A.R.T. Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound.\n* You want a goal to be difficult, but not too difficult. Find the sweet spot and adapt.",

        "text": "I hit a point in my life after a few personal tragedies where I let the pain eat away at me. I became severely depressed, finding fleeting salvation in excessive drinking and promiscuity. I continued this cycle for years, not realizing how bad of mental shape I was in. On the surface, I seemed alright to friends and family, but the time alone and in between my negativity and demons would eat away at me; Nothing made me happy, I had become incredibly nihilistic, slept all the time, and found no joy in life.\n\nIt all came to a head when everything came down at once. I lost my job, a girl who I loved left me, I went broke from my loose habits and wound up having to move back home. Laying down in my room one day, a tremendous weight came over me which felt like someone sitting on my head and shoulders. After everything that happened, what I did, and where I currently was in life, I came to the hard realization that I had done all of this. Period. I was the cause of all of this. There was absolutely nobody to blame for what happened, and what circumstance I was in but myself. Past tragedies and life’s servings of inevitable bullshit aside, I was the careless designer of my life which led me to these lowly circumstances.\n\nIt was at that moment that I made the definitive decision that I can't do this anymore, I can't be this person anymore. I cannot let any tragedy from my past dictate my life and future anymore. In ways unseen, I was killing myself by doing this; my spirit, my energy, my love, my passion, my creativity. I decided that I was going to change, no matter what happened or came my way. Since making this decision, I have started my own business, I have launched a mentoring practice, teaching people some of the things you'll see below, and overall helping them become better. I wrote a book; which you can view at mhood design dot com and I am on the continuous path to improvement and things are looking great.\n\nWith all that said, I have recently used my path to begin mentoring people to help them grow and get out of any negative scenarios of the mind they may be in. From life and from this practice, I’ve come to realize that most people have been in similar scenarios, and in a lot of ways, we are all trying to work through the pains in our lives and in our past as to not let them encompass our being.\n\nHere are some of the items I have learned from my journey and also from observing others:\n\n**1. Go Get It Yourself** \\- Nobody is coming to save you. As romantic as the idea sounds, usually it does not happen. You have to be your own hero and go get what you want yourself. Sure, people may help along the way but generally, other people have so much going on within their own lives to pay attention to or help you get your act together. You have to do this task yourself. The strength that will come from you taking the strides forward to better yourself and your position will be immense, and that is the only way out. You have to make the way yourself.\n\n**2. You Are Your Habits** \\- Show me a person who drinks all the time, eats crappy, food, watches 5+ hours of tv a day, and I'll show you someone who isn't going too far. You literally are what you do continuously. You are an amalgam of habits and actions compounded over time that brought you to where you are now. Those little things you do may not seem like much now, but overtime they build up into what makes up your life. Be very mindful about what habits you partake in.\n\n**3. Your Thoughts Can Be Designed** \\- No matter what anyone tells you, your thoughts that inevitably shape you, can be designed. Whether you currently have a more negative or positive outlook, your thoughts, vision and perspective are malleable and can be formed to work for your rather than against you. You can literally train your mind to think better, stronger thoughts, while simultaneously getting rid of negative, debilitating thoughts. By changing the way your internal monologue works, you can change your life and perspective on things toward abundance and strength and toward the positive.\n\n**4. Facing The Pain, Is The Answer to Your Pain** – A new adaptation from Rumi; “The cure for pain, is in the pain”. This is truly a profound statement. What I take away from this through observation and personal experience, is that whatever bothers you, or eats away at you, keeps you up at night when you are alone; your demons, need to be faced. The answers lie in that confrontation. Problem is, most people are terrified of facing this because they don’t know what may happen. We get comfortable being who we are and don’t want to change, even if it is potentially for the better. But facing your demons and your pain are paramount to you living a healthy, fulfilled, clear life. This is the only way.\n\n**5. You Attract What You Are. Period** – Many people want to be this, that and the other thing; rich, successful, retire early, famous. At the same time, they never work, they procrastinate, they complain, and they have pissy attitudes. The disconnect can be clearly recognized when written out. How can someone be successful, rich, make passive income with a lack of work ethic and a pissy, procrastinating, bad attitude? It just doesn’t add up. You attract what you are. Same goes for your partner, we generally attract our equal but opposite in a mate. So, how do you expect to get with an upper echelon person of consciousness or refinement if you are not there yet? Sometimes you can cheat the system and acquire some of these things, but they will not last. If you want to get top tier results, no matter what they be, you have to become a top tier individual of the same substance you want out of life.\n\n**6. Change Can Be Hard** – And that is why most people simply don’t do it. We get stuck in ruts and patterns of life; work – home – tv – dinner – bed and we don’t see any sense in really disrupting this. We want more, but we are unwilling to really change to acquire it; the healthier body, the deeper presence, the passion project, the business to help get you where you want to be. We want more but are seldom willing to put in all of the effort that is required. Maybe we do it for a few days or a week or maybe a month and then we stop, because the change we wanted did not come quick enough. Which leads to the next subject…\n\n**7. True Progress Takes Time** – We live in a society that seemingly wants more and more to happen in less and less time. As great and convenient of a concept as this is, this is not a natural system, yet people expect great things to happen overnight, often forgetting great things take great efforts. The very concept of positive progress or change happens over a significant period of time. Nature teaches us this, one of the best examples being the massive wooden pillars that inhabit a large part of the earth; trees. Those mighty trees take years to grow big and strong, first establishing strong roots as their foundations, allowing their branches to grow larger and larger reaching higher and higher toward the sky. Your life’s progression is more similar to this natural growth than a quick service tech application providing results in seconds. You just need to start with deepening your roots and foundations, just start, soon you’ll be reaching for the sky.\n\n**8. Have a Mission** – Every “successful” person I have ever met or run into, whether they were rich of the mind, body, spirit, financially, or a combination of all of those had a mission; Something bigger than themselves was driving them. Whether that was to run a successful business, be a great parent, help people, to create, to build, or anything in between these items, they were propelled forward by these higher callings. Develop a personal mission statement and path for yourself, whatever that is for you. Ignite that passion in your soul and proceed forward on your mission and your path.\n\n**9. Hate is Love, Just deeply blinded** – The people who demean you, dislike you, harshly criticize with attempts to debilitate you, or even hate you, have a strange admiration for you, they just don’t know how to express it more positively. This is in part due to the pains, misfortunes, and insecurities they have yet to come to grips with or face within their lives. Seeing others with what they desire whether consciously or unconsciously breeds them with hate and contempt. No need to worry, stay on your path and wish them the best. Just understand where this is coming from. It will save a lot of headache and worry over what others think knowing the origin of the negativity.\n\n**10. Its All Work** – At the end of the day, this is exactly what it is. Work. If you want to get better, grow, develop, get stronger, learn a new skill, rid negativity, eat better, live a more fulfilled life, anything you want to do, the work has to back it. That is the only way. You’ll always get nothing for nothing. Once you begin putting in those efforts in your new directions, it will begin to pay you back. Embrace the work, learn to love the work and the process. Keep going.",

        "text": "**The theory goes like this:**\n\nWhen you done something productive, pause for 5-10 seconds and \"take in the moment\". Feel good about that. Mentally celebrate, in a way. It does not have to be something big, it's enough to \"mentally celebrate\" a productive streak of 20 minutes.\n\nDoing that repeatedly will over time \"rewire\" your brain. The brain will start craving those experiences and motivation to do productive things is the default state.\n\nSeveral super-productive friends have apparently been doing this instinctively for years, i.e. mentally celebrating. This is also seemingly supported by research as it utilizes one of the fundamental principles of neuroscience and neuroplasticity – \"neurons that fire together wire together\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Have any of you tried this?**\n2. **How has this worked or not worked for you?**",

        "text": "I would like to develop visualization skill. So I wonder about this. For example, can you visualize text and you read this? Or visualize sound precisely enough to differ C4 from D4? Also, I heard about tulpas and about the thing that some fighter trains using \"shadow boxing\". I don't know how real is this, but because this is a thing, it seems like visualize text or sounds might be possible. Though it would probably require much higher precision.\n\nAbout developing visualization. I was thinking that imagining stories with a lot of details, different paintings. Also, meditating and do your best to direct all your concentration to visualize one object like an apple, circle or maybe something more complex. It seems to me that it would be quite effective way to develop this skill. But maybe there's something good that I miss, or maybe I'm wrong of something? I would like to know it.",

        "text": "My favorite Charles Darwin quote is \"I am very poorly today and very stupid and hate everybody and everything\"\n\nThink Elon Musk does all his crazy stuff effortlessly and gets it right the first time? Nope. He works insane hours, has learned from a ton of mistakes, and has \"terrible lows and unrelenting stress\".\n\nWe think successful people don’t have our problems but they do. We pretend like all of their success is effortless and we’re failures because we can’t achieve the same success on our first try.\n\nI cannot put this any more bluntly:\n\nThey are not better than you. They are not different from you. They feel the same stress as you, the same anxiety, the same fear, the same depression, the same uncertainties.\n\nI once got lunch with an old friend whom I respected very much. We were both doing well in different fields, we were in different romantic situations, and had taken different paths in many other areas of life.\n\nShe seemed successful to me. She seemed confident. Her accomplishments seemed effortless, inevitable, and she seemed so certain about her path in life. In comparison I thought I was absolutely making everything up as I went along, I thought I made a ton of mistakes, and I was nowhere near where I wanted to be in many areas of life.\n\nAfter the initial pleasantries, however, I realized she felt the reverse about me. She thought I was the one who had their life figured out. She thought she her life was a mess and I was the one who knew what they were doing.\n\nWhat was really true? We were both doing fine, we were both too hard on ourselves, and we both had off days now and then (because all human beings do).\n\n&gt;We only see ourselves through a broken mirror, and we only see the highlight reels of the lives of others.\n\nThis is the most ridiculous universal truth I’ve ever heard of and it needs to stop. So many people feel like they’re a screw up and they think that everyone else knows what they are doing.\n\nStop it. Stop right now. For one thing, you’re beating yourself up. For another thing, you’re acting like they have something you don’t. Like there’s something keeping you from having the success you want.\n\nGuess what? If these successful people can feel the same insecurity and stress and uncertainty we feel, then we can apply the same persistence and hard work they did. Those negative emotions did not keep them from succeeding, and they aren’t a reason we can’t get what we want.\n\nThey are human beings just like us. The reason they are on billboards is because of that one last time they got up when they were knocked down. Because of the many hours of sweat and hard work they put in. Because they decided to take each setback as a teacher instead of a death sentence.\n\nI know you feel lost sometimes. I know you doubt yourself and I know you’ve tried a thousand things that haven’t worked. I know other people’s success can seem effortless, and can make you feel like a failure.\n\nI feel like that too. Every human does. Everyone thinks everyone else has it figured out. What if, just for a day, we assumed everyone was fighting demons very similar to ours? What if the feelings we have right now didn't mean we were weak or broken or inadequate? What if having them meant we were human? What if having them meant millions of other humans could hug us as we cried or vented and they would know exactly what we were going through?\n\nYour journey is your own. There's no other one with the exact same details. But the feelings you have, the struggles, and fears, the hopes...that part of it is the human experience.\n\n&gt;Don't be so hard on yourself thinking you're the only one who missed the memo. There was no memo. We're all winging it. We're all learning from our mistakes (hopefully), and that's okay.\n\nHere's the crazy part: If you can take a leap and open up to someone about these feelings, you're BOTH going to feel better. They have the same feelings, and they'll feel relieved to know you're a work in progress just like they are. Connect with someone, listen to their story. We're all in this together and you'll feel better knowing you're not alone on this one, far from it.\n\nFurther reading: If this message resonated with you then I think you would get a lot out of **Mindset: The New Psychology of Success – Carol Dweck, PhD**. She does a fantastic job of outlining how people often use self-defeating measurements of their self worth. Everyone can improve with practice and learning from mistakes and persistence, and her research makes a great case for the outlooks and perspectives that best support long term success and prevent feeling like a failure on the journey.",
