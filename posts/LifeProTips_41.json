I was using a stall in the restroom, and another worker came in the bathroom and made a remark out loud about how ‚Äúsomeone is blowing it up in here‚Äù and then he continued on to saying stuff like ‚Äúeww‚Äù etc. Just childish, kid-like behavior. Behavior you don‚Äôt expect from an adult.\n\nAnyways, upon hearing his indirect remarks about me going #2 like a normal human. I didn‚Äôt immediately react to his comments. At first I was going to laugh, but my brain stopped me from even doing that. **I didn‚Äôt react to his comments at all.** I remained silent and let him talk to his self. \n\nWe need to always remember, you absolutely do not have to react to all human stimulus. ESPECIALLY, if someone is trying to push your buttons, OR NEGATIVELY engage with you (given the context, some negative interactions may be necessary to engage in). \n\nWhen I didn‚Äôt have any reaction to the guys comments on me ‚Äústinking the bathroom‚Äù I witnessed how powerless it made him.. I witnessed first hand how when you choose to NOT react, it leaves the other person essentially talking to themselves. And it gives them a moment to actually realize they are fighting a battle with *nobody*. It didn‚Äôt take much silence for him to stop making remarks‚Ä¶ \n\nAlways remember, you DO NOT have to react to everything. When people try to test you or get a negative out of you, just sit back, collect your thoughts. Let the individual make comments to nobody. Because without you reacting, you leave them to talk to their self.\n\nUse your energy wisely. Good day everybody ‚ù§Ô∏è Peace Love Happiness to you all üôèüèæ",

I was reminded recently about this but Vic‚Äôs rubbed on the feet and toes during an athletes foot breakout will make it go away better and faster than almost any OTC stuff. \n  Years ago my news paper ran a column from dr gott and he swore by this. I rarely had athletes foot but my wife at the time was in the military and wore boots often. She would get athletes foot every couple of months. So I showed her the articles about Vic‚Äôs and she reluctantly tried even though she tried all the brand name otc things. \n  She applied in the morning and put fresh socks on then again before bed and slept with sock on. After 3 days it was gone. At the first sign of itching a few months later it only took a day or two to make it go away. After a few months and maybe four rounds of very minor athletes foot and Vic‚Äôs application she went from having it every couple months to maybe once a year if that. \n  It works on other skin issues as well had a coworker that I noticed wore a bandage on his finger every month or so for a few days. I asked and he said the dermatologist had tried multiple different treatments but noting worked. I told him about Vic‚Äôs. Like a year later he told me after several applications the skin irritation never came back. \n  Take that as you will but I‚Äôve seen it work and it‚Äôs pretty cheap and easy thing to try.",

I have talked to a lot of people who are considering buying a car and it seems like one of the main goals is always to spend as much as they can afford (sometimes more). This is totally fine and to each their own. If you can afford it and want to spend 50k on a brand new car, go for it! However, there is an ungodly amount of stress associated with a purchase that expensive, especially given the conditions that you drive in. I drive a Honda Accord that I got for $500 and it has been an amazing car‚Ä¶ just wanted to point out a few of the benefits to not caring about what you drive:\n1) no car payments/interest. Every month I drive it is a car payment in my pocket. \n2) if it breaks down, oh well it was 500 bucks. \n3) hailstorm? Don‚Äôt care about cosmetics. File a claim with insurance, collect a check for the ‚Äútotaled‚Äù car and keep driving it. \n4) Door dings, who cares!\n5) if it does break down, it‚Äôs usually much cheaper to repair than the newest cars are.\n\nThe list goes on and on but just a reminder that you are more than what you drive and you don‚Äôt have to have the nicest vehicle to be happy. I‚Äôve found that having a cheap car has removed a massive amount of stress from my life and been one less thing to worry about! Hope this helps someone out there. \n\nWhat are some benefits I missed?",

Hope this is okay to post here- I'm working on a choices-matter narrative video game where the player must try to survive as a weak and old doctor after an exile to an underground cave. I think this community will find it evocative as I've made it an explicit goal of the game for players to be able to resolve conflict through reasoning, logic, and understanding/manipulation of psychology instead of violence. Please take a look!\n\n*Yuma  Will Burn is an experimental narrative survival game where choices have  long-lasting story and mechanical consequences. Harsh survival mechanics exist alongside a dynamically changing narrative in an uncaring and sadistic world of triage, poverty, and fear.*\n\n[https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma\\_Will\\_Burn/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1961330/Yuma_Will_Burn/)\n\nAs a developer, I've taken a risk by dedicating so much time to a game of this type. The genre is VERY obscure and niche. I still did it though,  because I believe in both the artistic value of a deep and complex moral/narrative experience and the unbridled passion this audience for them has.\n\nI encourage you to check out and wishlist the game with the link above. I'm a biased party, but I think it's worth your time.",

        "text": "If somebody tells you they recently said goodbye to their foster dog and they are very sad about it:\n\nIf you are too busy for the conversation/don't have an interest in talking further, just say: \"I'm sorry to hear it's been hard. I have never fostered before but I imagine that you did a very good thing for your foster dog and their adoptive family.\"\n\nIf you want to talk further, say: \"I'm sorry to hear it's been hard. Do you want to talk about this?\"\n\n\nDo NOT say \"oh that's why I never foster dogs.\" That's not helpful for the foster families to hear. It makes them feel like you are saying they made a bad life choice or something. Fostering helps not only the dogs but the human communities, because it means dogs are taken care of, and it decreases the risk of stray, sick dogs running wild and potentially passing diseases to other pets/animals/humans.\n\nAlso do NOT say \"oh I know somebody who fostered a child. Giving up a dog is one thing, but giving up a child. I can't imagine that.\" I'm sure giving up a foster child is very painful too, but it doesn't diminish the pain of giving up a foster dog.\n\nContext: this LPT comes from my personal experience of fostering and hearing things that are not helpful from co workers/families/acquaintances. \n\nTL;DR: if somebody tells you they just said goodbye to their foster dogs and very sad about it, be sympathetic and don't minimize their pain.",

I know a significant source is the fact that my parents never gave me their approval so I never learned how to approve of myself, but I need to be responsible for making changes in my approach to myself.\n\nWhat are things I can do to create a permanent change in myself to stop needing other people to like me?",

They exist to provide a map and scope of objective reality. \n\nWhen reality is forsaken for immediate gratification or comfort, we begin to sink into delusion where anything and everything is possible. While on a surface level this may sound wonderful and empowering, in reality, it is a rabbit hole into chaos and disorder. \n\nIn a state of delusion, there is a tendency to ignore or deny the consequences of actions. In such a state, individuals tend to hold expectations without feeling they should meet any standards or criteria. Individuals may also hold a belief that a certain person or groups of people are out to harm them in some way. \n\nWhen delusion conflicts with reality, internal dissonance is created. This dissonance can manifest as anxiety, depression, dysphoria, and other mental and emotional disorders. While mental disorders or not solely symptoms of delusion, it is true that delusion can play a role. \n\nWhen people ground their thoughts and beliefs in objective reality, it may not be all butterflies and rainbows or a clear cut enemy to defeat, but it does provide solid ground to walk on. This is where stability and order can be established. From there individuals can develop and grow in healthy, sustainable ways.\n\nTruth doesn't exist to make you feel better about yourself but when you walk in truth you can become a better, more authentic version of yourself.",
