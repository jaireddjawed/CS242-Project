        "text": "Hey everyone. I live in Petaluma, California, around 50 minutes north of San Francisco, and like probably everyone here I feel impotent and disgusted and furious at the way the world is.\n\nWe live in a world where men rape women while laughing, where the white kills and enslaves the black, where the rich crushes the poor. We live in a world without justice, without ethics, without morals, and without restraint. We live in a gluttonous world, with societies that are rotting to the gangrene of fascism and greed.\n\nI've had enough. I've spent my whole life lamenting how shitty it is that we are pulled from the womb of nothingness into a conscious body that is made slave to wage labor and viciousness and struggle and death.\n\nI've had enough. I am not an optimist, but you all make me an optimist because you're just as pessimistic as I am. And that means we are all mad enough to try to fix this. Even if it grinds us into dust and our bones are scattered to the cosmos from a burning, red world engulfed in death, we can at least say we tried.\n\nI've started going to the SF and East Bay DSAs. If you want to join me, if you want to pledge to radicalize your friends and enemies and families and strangers, let's do it. Let's work together to protest, to shout, to vote, to disrupt. To fight, not to \"resist.\" \n\nPosting is praxis, but we can do so much more. I want to help you, and I want you to help me. I want to make this world less of a shit show. I know we can at least try, so let's do it. Let's join local organizations and  devote as much time as we can to stemming the tide of brutality that is rushing over our shores.\n\nPlease take a pledge with me to do something, and let's collectivize like all those stuffy old socialists said we should.\n\nFor our fucking humanity.",

        "text": "i couldn’t help but notice while watching the freak show that was the kavanaugh hearing , and the aftershock of public reaction that followed , certain vulgar reactionary responses being levied against my dear friend alcohol. i believe this to be an affront to not only myself, but also my fellow dirtbags. so please allow me to quickly retort to these vile accusations against our most blessed of vices\n\ni watched idly while robert mueller became a woke hero to the resistance crowd , a man whose testimony before congress served as a catalyst for an illegal war in iraq that has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths (a testimony in which he also called cuba a state sponsor of terrorism , in 2003 no less) , all because he was now investigating some supposed crime that could somehow validate hillary clinton. okay\n\noh well , i thought. libs gonna lib that’s just what they do \n\ni also saw , as amazing and unbelievable to my eyes as it was , james comey, the dude who reopened the email investigation less than two weeks before the 2016 election and incontrovertibly had more to do with hillary’s loss than any ‘bernie bro’ ever could , then become some kind of hero to these fools all bc he got canned and then said trump was stupid. okay \n\nlibs gonna lib , i thought , nothing u can do about it. \n \ni’ve watched as these same logically inconsistent cultural piranhas set their fangs against my poor ailing grand daddy bernard , calling him a shusher and a racist , belligerent accusation after deranged talking point levied against my sweet old beautiful geriatric prophet. and why ? all bc they were too cowardly to fight the real enemy. okay\n\nwhatever , i told myself , don’t let them drag you down to their impetuous level.  \n\nand then the bush clan. they tried to whitewash the whole bush family’s war criminal history just to set up a false dichotomy between ‘the good old republicans’ and whatever kind of indescribable mutant creature trump admittedly is. okay\n\nbut now they have gone too far. i can no longer remain silent. \n \nin their never ending bloodlust to avenge their dear queen , and the subliminal dialectic that they have collectively adopted as a defense against all things ‘other’ , they have now set their sights on our sweet holy nectar.... kavanaugh is no doubt a cretinous pasty hog spawned from the greedy womb of everything capitalism has hitherto represented. but in their fear of this heinous beast , and in their cowardice to face it head on , they have reverted to that same dialectic, that same false juxtaposition that they hide behind to blame all the harmless correlations instead of facing the actual causations\n\nwell...,,,... , no.\n\nstop\n\ndrinking is cool and good and holy and we will not sit here and let you make it the new enemy while the real enemies get away , u fuckin cowards.....\n\nalso this is the official friday night drinking thread who up \n\n",
