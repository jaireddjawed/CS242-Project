        "text": "I work at a local restaurant and I’m paid on a weekly basis. It’s minimum wage and the job isn’t amazing, but a paycheck’s a paycheck.\n\nWe usually get paid on Friday night (technically Saturday at 12:00 AM). On bank holidays, we should get paid 24 hours in advance, so my paycheck should’ve come in on Thursday night.\n\nWell, it’s Monday afternoon and my paycheck hasn’t come in yet.\n\nBut wait, there’s more! My general manager is out sick, the entire restaurant is being run by a floor supervisor, and no one knows why my paycheck hasn’t come in or how to get in touch with the payroll department. Might get in touch with HR, but HR is a pain in the ass and I’d rather not deal with them if I don’t have to.\n\nBut wait, there’s even more! A few coworkers have said the same thing has been happening to them. One coworker speculated that because it’s a bank holiday (Presidents Day), my paycheck might not come in until Tuesday—even though it should’ve come in on Thursday.\n\nSo I’ve decided that because my job apparently doesn’t want to pay me for my labor, then I’m going to simply not do my job and remain on the clock for the next 5 hours. I’ll gladly do my job if/when my paycheck comes through, but until then, I’m pulling up a chair and waiting for my shift to end.\n\nHappy Presidents Day!",

I got into a big argument defending my coworkers and myself from being overworked as well as caddiness from certain teachers and the VP. The VP pulled me in and gas lit me saying that everything is my fault for riling up all the other staff and then said that we are all replaceable. Oh I'm  replaceable during an education shortage? After that I decided to quit and be a substitute teacher in a few districts, including the one I left. Ever since I left it has been a shit show for them as 3 other people left after me and the couple people they got to replace arent even showing up to work. Best part is, I get to show up almost everyday to sub and make more money while being good at what I do and happy.",

        "text": "So many many years ago, I worked for a contract company in Ohio,  doing 1st level support for when at&amp;t had cable internet service. Not a fancy job, but paid really well at the time. \n\nSo, up on high they decided they didn't like how we were doing our job, and not following their script for every call. Normally some of the steps didn't need to be done, like we didn't need to power cycle your cable modem to make a payment, etc. \n\nSo then management, in their infinite wisdom decided it would be good to give us a new script for connection trouble shooting and told us to follow it exactly and not add, subtract, or change any steps otherwise we'd get in trouble. \n\nSo... we began following it. Example for the connection issue. \n\n1. Unplug cable modem\n2. Unplug network cables\n3. Wait 30 seconds\n4. Plug network cables back in\n5. Check network settings\nIf no resolution to connection, transfer to t2 support level. \n\nNow all of us on the evening shift, being nerds and tech geeks, noticed a glaring flaw with their steps. We attempted to point it out to them, but we were told not to question it and follow it exactly. \n\nSo that is what we did. After 4-5 days of hundreds of customers being sent to t2 support just to plug in their modem and get back online, we ended up getting a memo, telling us to go back to doing things the way we were before and just help the customer. \n\nIt was a hilarious for a few days, made our job fairly easy for trouble shooting.  Have other stories from that place, but more workplace hijinks than mc",

        "text": "In 2000 I was hired by a company in the construction industry. In 2002 they asked me to help start a new division of the company. ‘They’ are the owners and the general manager. The general manager made it known he had a bug up his butt for me after my first year. Intermittent little digs, flippant attitude, demeaning, etc. Cut to after we get the new division up and running and I request being able to start a web presence, ownership is all over the endeavor while the general manager brushes me off and says, “It’s your division, do what you want.”\n\nMy division functioned with a separate business name. As I’m purchasing the domain name, my thoughts turned to the mothership and how it has zero web presence. Checked out and lined up the actual two business names and several close permutations so they would be somewhat secure in knowing their business names couldn’t be taken out from under them. I go to the general manager and ask for a check from the main company to pay for the domain names and he, again, brushes me off, saying, “It’s your division (his favorite line), do what you want. You’ve got a credit card! Expense it like anything else!!” I did start to ask, 'Are you sure you want me to put it on my personal...' and was curtly cut off.\n\nBy 2004 my division was running at a %44 profit margin which netted $750,000.00 USD a year. In the first six months of its existence, I’d already paid back the build out, training, machines, equipment, all the startup/setup… that is how successful this division was. The general manager became jealous of my achievements and tried to seize control over operations citing he was the general manager of the entire company whereas prior, it was my division to do what I wanted. Each horn in by him, I'd deflect and defend my division. By 2005 I’d had enough and ended up quitting as I heard he was preparing to fire me to fully seize the shiny penny as his own and take all the credit. I planned ahead, saved money, quit, and took six months off; it was a spring to fall extravaganza of doing whatever the heck I chose. Good times. Good fricken times.\n\nAbout a year later, I can’t remember exactly how long, a charge appeared on my credit card for my former company’s domain names; being for several, the amount stood out like a sore thumb. I called and verified the charge and who/what it was for and in my conversation with a very nice person, they said, “Yes, Mister X, all of these names are registered to you.\"\n\nAbout three years after I’d left the old company, my phone rings and guess what number pops up on the screen? Oh, yeah, I let that go to voice mail. The message was from the bookkeeper asking if I could return their call. Next day, here they try again but straight to voice mail they go. After a week of messages that were now pleading me to call them back, I return the bookkeepers call.\n\nWell, the cat came out of the bag and the main company finally decided to build out a web presence and had shelled out a ton of money to do so. Think, online catalog, interactive webpage, all the things we expect now, but were ‘high tech’ then and were just coming into functional reality. Lo and behold, when they went to get their beautiful dot com up and functioning, their exact name was taken as well as a string of similar ones they could have used had I not snatched them up.\n\nThe bookkeeper asked me to release the names to them. I indicated that would be very easy to do. It’s a simple matter of signing them off, no? They agreed as their anxious web builder had prepped them for the chat with me. I said I’d be happy to turn the keys to the kingdom over to them, but I wanted a few things…\n\n\\-Reimbursed for all expenses up until that point for owning the domain names.\n\n\\-A finder's fee… that pissed them off, but what can I say, I was yelled at to put their domain names on my personal credit card.\n\n\\-And the general manager himself would have to hand deliver the check.\n\nThat third line item was a sticking point, but dear mister manager was forced to bend the knee. I mean, I certainly wasn't going to budge.\n\nGeneral manager shows up at the appointed place, hands me the check, and barks at me about returning THEIR DOMAIN NAMES TO THEM TODAY. He did this so loudly people in the coffee shop we met at turned and stared. I laughed and said, “After the check clears, sure, yeah.”\n\nHe balked and insisted I immediately transfer the names to them as I was holding up, “…the entire show.”\n\nAs I left, I smiled and said, “You’re to blame here. You yelled at me to put the domain names on my credit card.” He was absolutely fuming at this point. “Besides, I love taking your advice to ‘do what I want,’ remember? And I am.",

        "text": "I work for a family business with 30+ employees. This is a company that has friends and family members as top-tiered Management and often made up rules whenever they felt like it. \n\nWhen new employees join the company, they sign a basic employment contract stating the compensation, benefits and work hours. The company does not have a written code of conduct. \n\nOne particular manager is a friend of the President. Let’s call her Sally. Sally manages a team of 8 employees, including myself. We aren’t allowed to make small talk WHILE working and we are required to let her know when we start taking our breaks, and when we return from breaks. Sally interjects whenever a team member is asking another team member questions because Sally is a micromanager. \n\nSally also makes us come to work early once a week for 30 minutes (unpaid) so that she can recap the previous week and often uses this time to tell us what we’re doing wrong. She made it clear that that this weekly meeting is mandatory. \n\nDuring one meeting,she brought up expectations for continued employment at the workplace - no swearing, no talking bad about customers amongst ourselves, no personal phones on desks, no music during work hours, no talking to other departments unless it’s work related etc.\n\nThen she brought up dress code. It’s important to note that we’ve never heard of a dress code at work and our jobs do not require face to face interactions with customers. Most of our dealings are via phones or e-mails. We may see a customer drop by once or twice a year. Most of the team members wear hoodies/ long-sleeved t-shirts with jeans or leggings. I usually wear a simple top with pants with my hair neatly blow-dried. Apparently, that’s not appropriate. \n\nSally said we should try to dress better and more professionally to keep up with the company’s image. Her sell was “Dress not for the job you have, but the job you want”. She made us all sign a document citing the topic of discussion at the meeting. \n\nYou want us to dress for the job we want? Okay. A few of my colleagues and I decided to maliciously comply the following day. I put my hair in a messy bun, wore my Costco leggings and my husband’s old t-shirt. That was my everyday look when I was unemployed. \n\nSally saw me when I walked through the door and asked why I was underdressed. I said “you asked us to dress for the job I want. I want to go back to being a stay-at-home-mom. I loved staying at home.”\n\nShe said “That’s not what I meant. I meant bigger aspirations and goals” as she looked at me with exasperation. \n\nShortly after, my other colleagues showed up one after the other -two wearing full workout gear and one wore her Anime costume. One guy wore a t-shirt with expletives. \n\nThe President noticed and asked us if Halloween came early and we told him what Sally said. I don’t know what happened but safe to say, there was no mention of any dress code since. \n\nTLDR: Manager asked us to dress for the job we want, not for the job we have so I dressed as a stay-at-home mom.",

The first weeks was okay, I was getting the hang of things yet I saw that the employees were sneakily excluding me from things. For example, they brought lunch and they offer everyone else in my face. They don’t offer me. Or when it was Valentine’s Day and they made a whole feast and offered everyone (even other students) except me. They don’t call me by my name much, they call me “the student”.  I have to set things up, clean the rooms, wash instruments, Assist, and keep everything stocked up (they have me working in the back) I’m pregnant so I don’t force myself too much and I try to be creative when I get tired. I grabbed a chair the other day to sit down while washing the instruments used in procedures. Then I was needed to assist…..when I came back the chair was gone. I didn’t pay much attention until another employee who is very nice to me told me the manager herself removed the chair because she didn’t want to see me sitting down. I am allowed ten minute breaks, yet I feel like I cannot take them comfortably because I’m always the one that must do it. I have about three ish weeks left and I have been having breakdowns at home at least once a week +weekends. I know I am halfway, yet the weeks feel so so long. I am probably exaggerating because I’m pregnant so I’ve gotten sensitive but I try my best to be quick. I have the rooms set up before they even ask. I am quiet and don’t talk bad about everyone. I am not a malicious human, I’m actually really nice and sweet and a good team player. I can do so many things already, I know how to take vitals, draw blood, call back patients…yet they don’t ask.. even when they get busy. I’ve honestly tried to show I can but it’s like they don’t let me. I’ve looked for another site to transfer to, I’m waiting and hoping I can finish at another place. I’m tired of crying and dreading going…. Feeling like I’m being excluded to the max. It hurts. Did I mention I am a patient there and go for my OB check ups?\nI’m so exhausted and I don’t want my baby to keep feeling this. I just don’t understand how people can be that sneakily mean to someone who tries to be nothing but nice to them all.",

The budget was based on your position and I got myself a nice, fully equipped diesel car since I drove 200+  kilometers a day. All was good for a couple of years and the end of the lease was coming up. I was planning to get the same car again and found out that due to inflation the rates went up but our budget didn't.  This forced me to drive a model with a smaller engine and less options.\nSo I talked to management because the difference was only 50 euro's a month. The answer was no. I tried a few other things but they kept refusing. After reviewing my contract, I found out that I was also allowed to drive a gasoline car. Although the company encourages the employees that drive more than 100 kilometers a day to drive a more fuel economic diesel car. \nCue malicious compliance! \nI went to my dealership and after a few testdrives and some tax discounts they were able to get me a car loaded with options for a rate that was the same as a model with a smaller engine.\nTo my surprise, the leasing form I submitted was approved and one month later I picked it up and liked it from day one.\nComing from a diesel car with a consumption of 1 liter per 20 kilometers , I went back to 1 liter per 11 kilometers .\nAdd to this that gasoline was about 30 cents per liter more expensive than diesel. Fast forward one month, fuel statements coming in and suddenly I'm the one who uses the most fuel in the company. Got called in the office to explain.... So I did and pointed out that the regulations stated that people were encouraged but not required to drive fuel economic diesel cars. And since they did want to do anything on my budget, I got myself a nice gasoline car. So saving 50 euros a month ended up paying 300 euros a month extra.\nShortly after that they closed this loophole.",

        "text": "So this was like 20 years ago or a little less. I applied to a tv/radio reporter position and we have to take a written test that passed with flying colours (there dozens to hundreds that apply for like two positions) so I got called back.\n\nI had some limited experience appearing on tv and radio so then 10 or so that showed up for the second round were told to wait in a room that I immediately recognized as \"the green room\".  I  said this out loud and the other folks in the second round, abut 7 girls and 3 guys, all started asking me what that was.\n\nI told them flat out that this wasn't an interview, we were about to be called into the studio one by one. I chuckled and said maybe we would have to sit in the anchor seat, which is a huge thing every person in my country has seen on tv since childhood.\n\nAt this point several of the (young) girls start hyperventilating and the guys just walk around in circles swearing and kicking the floor. Like \"SHIT! \\*kick\\* SHIT! \\*kick\\* SHIIIIT! \\*hard kick\\*\n\nSo I was like: \"You guys just prepared to recite your CVs, huh?\" to which I got mumbles of yes from many.\n\nThree girls and one dude went ahead of me, all came out crying or sobbing when they came out and the tension in the \"green room\" started to rise. At this point I didn't expect the job but knew this job place is all about throwing people in the deep end - because were expected to keep our cool on LIVE radio and tv after all.\n\nSo when it was my turn, I just kept repeating this mantra in my head about keeping it cool. A producer leads me into the main news studio, which as I said all people in my country were familiar with (it's like suddenly being in the BBC news studio for your Brits, it's national broadcaster).\n\nI remember thinking to myself: \"OK, they are testing if I will shit my pants, just get through this.\" Just then I was ordered to sit in the anchor's chair as they attached microphones to me. Out of the darkness comes a familiar voice of a news reporter I was familiar with, but with a hint of the puppet from \"Saw\".\n\nThe voice said: \"In 30 seconds you might as well be live to hundreds of thousands of people. The teleprompter is running on the camera on your left, but will switch half way through. Whatever happens, DO NOT STOP READING. Good luck.\" - and then the news theme just starts ticking like it's a real broadcast. Now I understand the tears from those that went before me. At this point I decide to just read whatever came on the prompter, malicious or otherwise.\n\nSo the teleprompter starts, and this is not verbatim, but it was a story from Sri Lanka that mixed my native language (very very different) with long and difficult names from an essentially alien culture, I just wet into a trance and read: \"Good evening, I am Morrison. We lead to tonight with the story that the **Bandaranaike–Chelvanayakam** pact in Sri Lanka is in danger. Lieutenant colonel  **Nandasena Gotabaya Rajapaksa** has cited a constitutional crisis and  **Ranil Wickremesinghe** , leader of a major political faction in the country, is calling for an investigation.\"\n\nThis went on for like 5 minutes with progressively more difficult names until \"the voice\" told md to just stop. Apparently I pronounced the names OK, but in reality he didn't care. He hired me and told me it was because I showed no signs of panic, read twice as long as anyone else did, was the only one that didn't stop and recompose myself and just did as I was told. Never stopping, just kept reading, no matter the stress level.",

        "text": "Background info, I close often, and previously, management wanted us to go home when we were finished at the end of the night. They mainly did this to save money. The federal minimum wage increased, but our budget didn't. After they changed it to only leave if both employees wanted to leave. (Two people have to be in the building at all times.) This wasn't an issue, and there is only one employee who ever wants to leave early.\n\nThis situation started when another member of management in the same grade as me started beef with me. I read the schedule wrong and left work after 8 and a half hours instead of staying and doing overtime like they wanted. After that, she started scheduling me for 6 or 7 days straight. She also marked leave incorrectly for employees who attended my wedding. (This is a whole other HR situation right now) Among other things she's done that aren't fair in regards to scheduling. \n\nNow to the malicious compliance. The manager started asking employees when I leave and snooping, talking shit etc. She doesn't know my exact hours because i dont have to clock in or out. She finally told my boss after weeks of snooping. He pulled me into his office yesterday and told me to use leave every time I leave work early. He tried to explain that I am salaried, but that only means I'm exempt from getting overtime pay. They want me to use leave so that they can take money out of my pay. He also wants me to force the one employee who wants to leave when we are done to stay the whole time.\n\nI don't often leave early, so I've decided to fill out leave slips every single time I leave 1-5 minutes early. I'm also considering doing this for coming in late and long lunches. We have a 5 minute grace period, so they won't take the money out of my check. It doesn't cause me any harm, but it is creating even more work for manager and my boss.\n\nBoss won't be at work until Tuesday, so I'll have to wait and see his reaction.\nI'm also taking this to HR once she is back in the office as well.",

This took place on a Friday as we have daily sales and for Friday the wings are on sale. Bucket of wings is $9.99 for 2.5lb the normal price is $17.99 for a bucket, we also sell it by the pound for $8.99 but next to nobody getting wings get anything but the bucket. I have worked at this store for almost a year and a half now, this took place a couple of months ago. \n\nI show up to work (closing shift) and my manager and store director (aka boss man) are in a bad mood just got a feeling that later turned out to be true, why I don’t know. I do my normal things serving people making food. Everything was fine till about an hour into my shift boss man comes up to me to telling me to make wings and “don’t stop frying till 7”. This is something he tells me but only once and normally when he’s leaving but today he felt telling me what felt like every 15 minutes. After awhile of him telling me this my patience was running thinner and thinner and at the same time it got slower and slower. When boss man was leaving he told me “don’t stop frying till 7”, 4 times within 20 minutes. Once he left I decided why not do what he says, over the course of the next hour I worked extra fast to make as many wing buckets as I can (please note that at this time it was basically dead in the store). By the time 7 came I had finished making all the wings I had available to me at the time, which ended up being 37 buckets. This filled up 2 1/2 shopping carts far more than the normal 0-3 that are left at the end of the night. The next day I walk into work get to my department and within 5 minutes boss man comes over to talk to me and asks that I don’t make so much next time, to which I respond with a head nod and an “Ok”. Since then he has not once’s asked me to keep frying till 7.",

As snide and petty as I can get, I don’t funk around with a kid’s food. I’m nice to kids because they have an excuse for acting a fool. \n\n#foreshadowing\n\nShe came to the window livid…..

It was SO great I was jealous. But in that moment it took all I had not to burst out laughing as they drove off into the sunset.

        "text": "Starting off, sorry for not updating on Friday (10th) like I said I would, life got in the way plus several events have happened. This will be a decent-size update. Friday rolled around after I was coming back from the small vacation I had. (the location had no service) I greeted some of the servers I'm cool with and they all gave me an oh crap look since apparently, my boss had been trying to call me to come, open and close on Wednesday, and Thursday. \n\nobviously, I didn’t know this since I had no service where I had been at the time. I make my way to the boss expecting to get a freak out from him which surprisingly he didn’t have. he welcomed me back and asked a couple common questions about my trip. After 5 minutes of talking he springs on me “since you didn’t come in on Wednesday and Thursday, you need to come in Monday and Tuesday of next week” to which I replied, “did you schedule me for those days?”And he immediately replies with “no but I know you have nothing to do since your just a teen” at this point my face just looked like I had seen a bear, riding a bicycle while juggling bowling pins(O-O). I was absolutely amazed at how those words came out of his mouth with such ease like he really believed he had any sort of power over me. I paused for a moment and said “ no, I don’t think I will be doing that since I'm not currently scheduled on those days. I will not show up on those days” he then tried to argue that he had to come in, on his days off to cover my shifts(i learned from the servers that he never showed up). The last thing I said to him before I started working was “this isn’t my problem, hire more people.” And walked off.\n\nSaturdays (11th). Today was looking like it was going to be pretty mundane, busy floor, a lot of food needing to be run, tables that need to be put back together, Pretty usual tasks of the job until my boss showed up and started barking orders even though the restaurant was very packed and we needed all hands on deck but obviously, that’s not what he wanted, he could care less if the restaurant went to the toilet all he cared about was being in control. The boss tells me and a server to go clean the storage closet and if we don’t we can just be cut. We both reluctantly go and do it since he had 4 tables to attend to and I wanted to help him so he wouldn’t get bad tips just because a man-child wants to give tasks that can be done later and lay it out on the table for us to see.\n\nSuper Bowl Sunday (12th) was supposed to be a really slow day since we don’t have any TVs on the walls and we don’t serve bar food, But as soon as church got out we were super slammed to the point you couldn’t see the front door it stayed like that until 3 pm and I was just ready to leave, so I did I clocked out on time as you would at any other job and my boss saw that and said “you are not being a team player right now. You are just going abandon ship just like that?” To which I reply “well yeah, you only have me for the time scheduled, not for when it's convenient for you.” I have no problem working over the time I'm scheduled for but I just can’t with his snarky remarks and annoying temper tantrums he has on the daily. I'm just very done with him so why would I go above and beyond for him, plus it was the Super Bowl, and of course, I had plans I wanted to hang out with my friends and not work.\n\nThursday (16th). I received an email from the new place I'm going to be working at and I got the job, the new job will be paying me   $16/hr double of what I’ve been making, I also start Monday!  I had gone to work the same day and told my boss “I will not be able to put my 2 weeks in. However I will work through this Sunday and that will be my last day working for you I hope that is enough time for you, so you can find my replacement and if this doesn’t work for you, I can always make my last day be today. (since Texas doesn’t require employees and employers to submit a 2-week resignation)\nHe starts to freak out since mon-Thursday of next week, the restaurant has a bunch of large reservations. He replies with “if you stay with us, I can give you a big raise for all your hard work” my eyebrows raise since there is no way that his raise will match my new employer's rate. Intrigued I ask “how much were you thinking of giving me” (drumroll, clears throat) “ I can give you a .25c raise which will make your paychecks a little bit heavier” I am dumbfounded, my brain packed up and jumped off my head, this was the best deal I could’ve gotten ever!!!! screw the new job who can say no to an extra 20 dollars to their paycheck….. kidding :/\nI politely declined and told him I had already made up my mind and for the rest of my shift, he was in the office scrambling around posting job listings and looking for applications. It’s really crazy how someone goes from being a complete dictator to a servant when they lose their power, these last two days he’s been nothing but cupcakes and sunshine because he knows I can leave whenever I like. \n\nThank y’all for reading, I will try to post an update this Sunday on my last day working here if there is a big enough event.",

Company policy states that if we did work overtime it had to be submitted within 30 days or it would be denied. He loved being the bearer of bad news if someone missed that deadline. And all overtime had to be approved prior by management. \n\nAnyway, at my yearly review he mentioned it wouldn't hurt if I took home a document or two to read over weekends. Confirming just \"an hour a night of light reading\" would be quite beneficial. He even noted this as a \"development opportunity\" in my review.\n\nSo I followed his recommendation and would read for an hour each night before bed. He took pleasure in reminding me about it in front of co-workers and smugly praising me for \"finally listening to him\". \n\nThen just before the 30 day deadline I submitted my overtime of 1 hour each night (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) for the last 4 weeks. He was furious but knew there was nothing he could do as it was documented in my review. I was directed to do my reading during business hours. after that.\n\nThe kicker? Company policy also states overtime not merged with my normal work hours is paid at a minimum of 4 hours pay at overtime rates. Meaning I got 7 hours pay for every hour I read each night. Quite lucrative in the end.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago, but I never got to share it.\n\nI used to rent an apartment in a big complex of ~200 apartments, as well as an outdoor parking space. The rules by the real estate agency, who was administering the apartment complex, were that you had to display your renter's card in your car when parked. The agency provided you this card when your parking lease would begin.\n\nTo enforce this rule, a private company would frequently patrol the area and issue \"fines\" to any parked vehicle without a card. The police had no juristiction there, as these were private parking spaces. Technically, these were \"inconvenience fees,\" because only the police could issue a fine. But for all terms and purposes, they were equivalent to fines, as if you didn't pay within 14 days, they could send them to collections.\n\nSome people have their card permanently attached to their windshield to avoid the risk of forgetting to display it. I don't feel comfortable to do so, as the card displays my address. Therefore, I just prefer to manually take it out off the glove box and display it when parked.\n\nCue a 2-week vacation with my wife, and we both forget to take the card out. We had the car serviced the morning before the trip, so we left in a hurry. You know where this is going now, we return back and find not one, but three (3) fines, each of ~US$60 (equivalent). The other 2 were duplicates, issued on different days; the private company had patrolled the area thrice during our absence. On top of that, the initial fine had expired, so I was most likely expecting a \"reminder\" slapped with a \"reminder fee\" or ~$20.\n\nFine, I forgot to display the card, I'll pay the fine... but not all 3 of them. Had I not been on vacations, I'd had just placed the card in the car after the first fine.\n\nI wrote a polite letter to the company, explaining the situation and providing the flight tickets to prove our absence. I assume the responsibility of paying the initial fine, but before I do, I kindly request to have the duplicate ones annulled.\n\nThe security company wouldn't budge. \"_You know the rules of the real estate agency. Have the card on display, or else pay the fine. You have to pay all three of them._\"\n\nWell, since these were the rules, I decided to forward the entire situation to the real estate agency, asking to have the duplicates annulled. An administrative assistant emails me the next day:\n\n\"_Hi, we talked today with the security company. We've annulled all fines, including the initial one, you can safely toss them away. However, please make sure to clearly display your card next time to avoid such issues._\"\n\nA few days later I saw a notice in another building that read: \"_If you have forgotten your card and received a fine, please call the real estate agency to resolve this._\" This notice probably predated my incident, but it then became clear that the security company was employing predatory  tactics to collect fees that were mparginally legal.\n\nCorporate greed deprived them of $60 that day; they could had just agreed to annul the duplicate fines, but instead opted to collect $180.",

        "text": "Once I worked for this \"lady\"  who owned a Home Health Agency, and I was running it for her.   At first it was not that bad. Margaret liked me and had me doing a lot of things that, maybe went above my pay grade,  but I didn't mind so much because I was learning a lot and it didn't involve any direct patient care.  In 2014, when I first started, she had an LVN named  Nnenna (way too many N's, I know, but she was cool.) Sometimes patients would go to her office and she would shut the door. IDK why she bothered to do that when it was obvious that she was admitting them. I wasn't exactly comfortable with that, because you are supposed to be an RN,  but at least she was a nurse. After it turned into 2015, though, Boss M decided to put Nn out in the field, so I was the only one in the office.  Shortly after that happened, M caught me on my break and said,\" Hey, I need you to do me a favor. There's a patient in your office, and I need you to take his vitals and write down all his meds and put him in the system.\"  I said,  \"Margaret, are you actually trying to get me to admit this guy?? That is so far out of my scope of practice that i would lose my massage license and maybe go to jail!\"  \"Oh, com'on you know you can do it, you have the knowledge and experience\". I said you can try to flatter me all you want, but I'm not doing it, you're an RN, why don't you do it so nobody gets in trouble with the State?! She said, okay, I will give you a $50 bonus for every one of those you do.\"  I said really, $50? Wow, ok then, I'm in!   I asked her how exactly I w.as to come up with diagnoses, though with no MD report? She said to just Google the meds and see what they are prescribed for and get the diagnosis from that. That is so illegal I almost called my mom to ask her to put money in my commissary, lol.  So anyway, I did end up doing it that one time.  But I had to outsmart her for ethic's sake, or I would have been stuck doing those for the rest of eternity and probably end up with legal problems for $50 a pop  and I decided to deliberately make an error. The patient said he was on Gabapentin. I know what that is, and I also know  why it is prescribed, it could be for multiple reasons. Ususlly pain or anxiety. So I put down Seizure Disorder, the rarest problem it's prescribed for. When M saw what I had put in, she started yelling at me \"^you know that's for neuropathy!!! \" (nerve pain).  I said \"well , I don't know that actually, there are a bunch of uses for Gabapentin and seizure codes pay more than Neuropathy ones, don't they? According to the coding guide they do  I know how important it is for you to make you more money, right.?  And guess what?  Ya know,  I noticed that more than half of our patients are taking that, so I went back and changed all their diagnoses to say Seizure Disorder, and exported all the corrected assessments to the state already. aren't you proud of me?!  (of course I did nothing of the sort, lol)  She literally lost her wig, and screamed \"Do you have any idea how many ADRs I'm going to get?? It will take forever, I will have to have someone scan every last one of those records and submit them to Medicare! Meanwhile, they won't pay me!! Aaarrrrggghhh! \"   I shrugged and said \" Well I would probably estimate around 50, if the numbers add up,\" .Ok, she screamed, \"  that's it! I'll never ask you to do that ever again!\"  And give me back that $50!:  \"Really?  Oh no! Are you sure?  Oof wow, I'm SO SORRY I messed up! My bad!\" I know she saw me laughing at her as I walked away,  there were cameras everywhere, after all.",

My mom worked nights so we spent most evenings with my dad. He liked order. He wasn’t real strict or mean. He never really spanked us or anything like that it… It was more along the lines of the idea of a spanking. The thought of getting the swat across the bottom was enough.\n\nI had never really pushed his buttons. I was a pretty good kid (until the divorce, but that’s another story). But I considered myself too old for that nonsense anymore. This was my first try at a little pushback.\n\nSo .. the sun is going down. Dinner is over with, dishes are done and we are all stretched out among the various pieces of furniture and as I said, I was on the floor with a big pillow and we were watching whatever was on the tube that night. My dad liked to have the room dimmed while watching tv when it was dark out and the sunset was approaching.\n\nHe said “OP flip off the light”\n\nI didn’t think. It wasn’t premeditated. I didn’t even know I had this level of smart-assery in me — but I did as I was told.\n\nI rolled over, extending my arm up towards the light fixture and as serious as I could — I flipped off the light. I made sure to hold the pose as I presented my dad with my first ever full blown middle finger (in his presence).\n\nHe paused and looked at me. His eyes went just a little wider as he realized I was doing just as he had asked.\n\nHe started to laugh, and I am not ashamed to admit that I was relieved. While he was still chuckling, I jumped up and ran over to the light switch and flipped the light switch off. \n\nI know it’s not a big deal but it still makes me smile..",

        "text": "From 97 - 07 I worked for a music magazine.  Besides my regular duties I also did some writing.  I had a monthly column,  wrote the occasional editorial and sometimes did CD reviews.  We did between 3 to 5 reviews per monthly issue but received over 20 CDs per week from indie artists.  With so much to choose from we had an unwritten policy to not trash an independent band (major label releases were fair game).  They weren't puff pieces, we would still be critical and point out areas that could be improved, but with so little space for reviews we wanted to focus on the positive rather than wasting it punching down on a local band.  \n\nMany artists would call or email the Editor to check on their submission and if a review was forthcoming.  She was always diplomatic, saying we get a lot of CDs and can only do so many reviews a month.  Most artists accepted that and moved on.  Some were more persistent, but one band in particular just would not leave it alone.  They called and emailed her constantly and her replies got less diplomatic.  She listened to the CD and flat out told them they did not want us to print a review.  Finally she couldn't take it anymore and gave it to me to review.  To her credit she did not try to sway me one way or the other, just told me to be honest.\n\nHere's the thing about independent bands, most of them are ok.  They're not great, they're not terrible.  They can sing, they can play their instruments, they can stay in tune, they can stay in time.  But they're not very memorable.  Songwriting is hard.  For most artists, 2 seconds after I'm done listening I couldn't tell you anything about what I've just heard.   That's for most bands.\n\nThese guys, on the other hand, were flat out awful.  Performance, lyrics, melody, production value, there was not one redeeming quality that I could spin into a positive review.  Musicians can be arrogant and not always realistic when judging their own music but these guys were beyond the pale.\n\nI don't remember exactly what I wrote as it was almost 20 years ago but it was definitely the most critical review of an indie band we'd ever done.  I was honest and straightforward and tried to make suggestions for improvements.  My Editor let it run in the next issue.  The only feedback she got was a short email from them saying thank you when they learned the review was coming out and nothing since.  Thankfully no other artist ever pushed like them so that was the only time.\n\nIf someone doesn't want yo review you, there might be a reason.",

Keep in mind I am pretty shaken up about the death, haven't had a lot of time to process, stressed trying to ensure I have everything and still have to go and grab my grandmother so we can convoy out in the AM, repack etc, and also very very hungry. You get the picture. We finish ordering our subs and get up to pay. The total and I shit you not is $20.01, I have 1 twenty dollar bill and a few hundreds and thats it.

I stare at him for another five seconds. Look down at his tip jar, which has 1 single penny and nothing else. Calmly take it out of the jar, and very gently put it on the counter while grabbing my subs and walking away slowly with the craziest feeling of satisfaction I have yet to feel again.",

Working environment was the definition of malicious complaince.\n\nThen, one day, corporate demands that we start selling products. We, who have to deal with irrate, stupid customers, now have to sell those same products that are actively failing.\n\nOne man, the legend, starts rising by selling like a madman. We called him \"the golden budda\", \"la chuleta\", among other names. Our target was 3% of calls must be sales. Motherfucker was at 50%. He was part of our team, and because of him, we enjoyed great benefits.\n\nThe general manager was a walking stereotype of how the world views americans: a caucasian blonde, fat, loud idiot who had no trouble insulting others when he saw fit. He attacked the top seller, calling him a fraud. However, he was so goddamn stupid that he failed to prove his claims. He had to apologize.\n\nThe golden man was famous and was living like a rockstar. Went to work drunk. Sometimes left early. The manager was thinking of promoting him to supervisor. He gave secret coaching to others to achieve his golden secret. Suddenly, other stars rose.\n\nThen, complaints start coming in. Tons of customers have had equipment installed they didn't order. A huge backlash came back, for which the inept manager was looking like the fool we was. Turns out those \"sales\" were made up and forced on unsuspecting victims.\n\nThe manager punishes our boss by sending him to training, like a new hire, humiliating him. This makes him quit. The golden man is fired, and so are his followers. However, the damage has already been done.\n\nCompany had to close several months later. They had to change their legal name and were closing the operation. Their customer, the cable company, had cut ties with them. During those closing months, people stayed until the last day to enjoy their severance packages, but instead of working, they would play phone games and tell customer's to stick their cable boxes up their asses. Even supervisors would participate in this.\nI thank the Lord i don't have to see this kind of work ever again. \n\nTldr: corporate gets so hungry with sales that they let their top salesman ruin everything",

Normally it’s an inconvenience but not so drastic we have to move rooms. Yesterday, it was the worst I’ve ever experienced since I started teaching at this school. \n\nTeachers immediately tried to move their classrooms, get out of the hallway, etc etc. One class moved into the principals conference room, and from the gist of it - our principal was livid that her space was invaded. \n\nWe received an email stating that we are not to move our classes without notifying our supervisor, now that seems logical. However, the email went on to say that we are not allowed to leave our room to stroll, visit another classroom, etc etc without speaking to our supervisor or the front office. \n\nI was absolutely fired up when I read this email. I wanted to make her regret sending it as quickly as possible. I notified everyone in my hallway that they should be calling the office every time they needed to use the bathroom. I encouraged as many teachers as possible to constantly be calling to notify of their movement around campus. \n\nWithin two hours I had called the front office four times, once even just to let them know I was walking down to the front office. Most the teachers in my building called a couple times. Once, when the main receptionist was on lunch and another support staff was covering for her, I called to let them know I was going to the bathroom and the woman on the other end sounded so confused. “Do you need something…?” She awkwardly asked. I explained it was that per the email it was expected for us to notify the office of our bathroom breaks. She chuckled and told me to have a good time. \n\nWithin three hours we received another staff wide email explaining “okay, some clarification” and that we should NOT call the office if we need to go to the bathroom, have a stroll on campus, or visit another teachers classroom. \n\nI walked down to the office later that day with the biggest grin on my face and every support staff knew exactly why I was so happy. We all had a good laugh. One of the support staff said to me that the principal said “I didn’t mean it LITERALLY!” …if you are going to put something in writing to a group of professional educators, and be aggressive and rude about it, you better know exactly what you are saying. \n\n🤪",

        "text": "So this story is from my IT teacher, we’ll call him Joe. Before he was an IT teacher, he served a few years in the Marine Corps (I don’t know how many in total). He tells us a lot of stories about his times in the Marines, some of them are really fun, and others are pretty somber (he’s told us about his PTSD). It’s entertaining nonetheless. Anyways, one of the stories he told us today I knew was perfect material for this sub. I did ask him permission to post it.\n\nSo when he was in the Marines he was a Sergeant (Sgt). However, at the time of this, a new person joined the Marines and was about 17-18, much younger than him, Joe was probably like mid 20s at the time. The new guy, we’ll call him Noob, was a higher rank than Joe, but still younger, and a bit cocky. So Joe and the rest of his platoon were going over Mount Fuji on an amphibious vehicle, basically a big military van. So considering it’s a massive mountain, they came to a part of the mountain that had a really steep tilt to it. Now keep in mind there’s two types of radio communication; intercom and radio. Intercom means what’s being said will be told to everyone who has a radio, but radio will only go between 2 people. So Joe was driving the vehicle and they got to the steep part. Noob decided that he thought the vehicle could survive it and make it over fine. Joe knew that it most definitely wouldn’t, he was in the Marines for much longer than Noob. Noob, over the intercom, argued with Joe. He was telling him to go forward and that the vehicle would make it, but Joe argued back with him saying it wouldn’t. Eventually, Noob said;\n\n“I’m ordering you to drive this vehicle forward now!”\n\nNow, given that this was a direct order, Joe obviously had no choice but to comply. So, over the intercom, Joe told the rest of his platoon to buckle up and hold on tight. He closed the latch above his seat and buckled up too. Noob was confused by this, but didn’t buckle up or close the latch above him. Joe started to pull forward, and once they got onto the steep part they were going decently good. Noob seemed pretty confident, however almost immediately the vehicle started to tip slowly, one of those where you can feel it for a little before it flips. So Joe held on tight, and then they fell. They tumbled around and around like 5 times. During their falling Noob flew out of the hatch (or jumped out, he wasn’t sure) but wasn’t really hurt, he only got a concussion from the door to the hatch hitting his head as he went out. Joe was fine due to being buckled up, but some of the other passengers weren’t buckled so they flew around. Most of them broke a bone or two and/or got a concussion. Once they stopped, Joe got up and left the vehicle. Their gunnery sgt (we’ll call him red) immediately ran over. Now Red was your textbook tough-guy marine sgt. He was almost 7 feet tall, extremely built, broad shouldered, everything you’d expect. Joe immediately started explaining that it was an order and that he had to listen. Red said he heard everything due to the argument being on the coms. Noob ran over a minute or so later and started yelling.\n\n“What did you teach them? They don’t even know how to drive!” \n\nBasically, sicking the blame on Joe. Red, having heard everything, stomped over to Noob and grabbed him by the front of his shirt, yanking him forward and yelling at him. He then pushed Noob forward and socked him right in the face, knocking him out and dropping him. \n\nJoe did say to the class that if Noob hadn’t said everything on coms, he could’ve gotten in trouble, but most likely he would’ve straight-up said no to going forward, but it was just too perfect. He’s a great teacher, everyone loves him.",

        "text": "A few years ago I was employed by a relatively small but publicly traded company.  I virtually guarantee you wouldn't recognize the name if you weren't in their specific little corner of industry.\n\nWell, this place went public and decided to use some of the money to purchase an even smaller company, and suddenly we were in the DoD contracting business.\n\nAs you may or may not know, the US department of defense places restrictions on private sector contractors about how much profit they're allowed to make, among other cost-control mechanisms.  One such mechanism is that anyone working on DoD contracts has to charge their time to specific project codes so that they can compare your actual costs to the costs you estimated when you were awarded the contract.\n\nWell, our genius company decided that instead of only having the personnel working on these projects (which was no more than 50 people out of over 1000), that they would make every single salary person sign a time card every week.  For 95%+ of us, we charged 100% of our labor to the commercial side of the business, which was one project code.  \"Non Defense Overhead\" or something like that.  Most people just charged 8 hours per day regardless of how many hours they actually worked, because no one tracks their time down to the minute.\n\nShortly after this happened, new state legislation went into effect requiring that all employers provide 1 hour of sick leave per hour worked.  Nobody paid much attention to it.  But I did, because I was in a fairly specialized engineering role, with only 2 of us at the whole company, and I trained the other guy, who also happened to live overseas to support another site.  This is important later.\n\nI started charging my actual hours.  I noticed that despite how many hours I charged, the amount of PTO I was accruing stayed the same.  This happened 3 or 4 paychecks in a row, and then I approached HR.  They looked at me like I had two heads when I informed them they were not adjusting my PTO accruals based on hours worked.  \"But you're salary.  You're paid for 40 hours regardless of how many hours you work,\" they told me.  I explained how that didn't really apply to the situation due to the new legislation.  They again looked at me like I was completely crazy.  They said they'd get back to me with an answer in a week or two.\n\nFast forward two months.  I'm still diligently filling out my time cards like a good little drone, and I've spoken with several of my work buddies who start doing the same.  The thing about this particular group of folks was that we all traveled, internationally, oftentimes last minute, on a regular basis for work.  Well wouldn't you know it, it turns out that travel time (per our state labor laws) is considered working time.  Sixteen hours worth of flights to Germany?  All working time.  (I believe the language is \"place of rest to place of rest\"). And while you're there, you're not exactly relaxing.  It's long days, handling customer concerns, multiple days in a row.  A perfect storm of circumstances happened that fall, where we were all travelling around the same time, and we all booked 120+ hour weeks of work.\n\nWe all eagerly awaited our paystubs to see all that extra PTO accrued and... nope.  We approached HR again.  They told us they would escalate the issue to their attorney.  We went back to work.\n\nWell, not surprisingly, things started going downhill for all of us, we started bitching about things a bit, and we all end up quietly looking for jobs. Within a 5 week period, all of us put in our notices... and I lost my patience.  I wrote an email to HR detailing our contacts with them and informed them that I would be escalating to the labor board without a full accounting of all back-owed PTO that would need to be paid.  I got a panicked phone call within about 5 minutes.\n\nHR Drone: \"Why are you even recording your hours that way? You're salary!\"\n\nMe: \"Because we have to fill out timecards.\"\n\nHR Drone: \"Why don't you just put 8 hours per day like everyone else?\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, but it sounds like you're asking me to falsify my timecard.  When I sign it, the timecard specifically asks me whether I've reported my time accurately, under threat of prosecution.\"\n\nHR Drone: \"...no, I'm just... why haven't you brought up this issue previously?\"\n\nMe: \"I have.  Twice.  With you.  I detailed those encounters in the email I just sent.  I'm sure the company's attorney has informed you of your requirements by now.\"\n\nHR Drone: \"They... haven't gotten back to me.\"\n\nMe, grin now wide across my face: \"Well, funny enough, I went ahead and emailed our general counsel.  It turns out my email was the first they've heard the concern.  I've put in my notice.  I expect to be paid in full for all back-owed PTO, or I'll be filing a report with L&amp;I, who take accusations of wage theft fairly seriously.  I believe they give you a week to remit payment or pay up to triple what's owed?\"\n\nHR Drone: \"...\"\n\nMe: \"Please contact me via email *only* when you have decided on a path forward.\" *click*\n\nIt turns out that not only did I get paid the full PTO I thought I was owed, there was a bit extra on there as well.  And one of my buddies went ahead and reported the company to the labor board anyway, which apparently caused quite the stir.  Last I heard, the HR department (with the exception of a couple of recruiters) got completely turned over, all the way up to the VP.\n\n**TL;DR** Make a salary employee fill out a timecard?  That's gonna cost ya.",

        "text": "I've worked union construction for a dozen years. First 5 were for commercial/industrial jobs, went residential in 2016.\n Got used to accurate timekeeping, where your clock in/out times are kept to the minute. Plenty of paychecks with random times, like 39.92 hours because I clocked out 5 minutes early one day... Of course the ot at 1.5x pay gets denied if you work 5 minutes over. So I kept a notebook and never got taken for a minute of my time without pay.\nWell who would've thought, but the shop worried about an extra 5 minutes were focused on the wrong ways to make money, so I switched shops in 2020 (a couple months ago the first shop closed doors, another story).\nNew shop has us self reporting time instead of clocking in. Due to the last shop, I kept my time to the nearest 5 minutes, all logged. Most guys at the new shop take complete advantage of the self reporting system... Taking 2 hour breaks, sleeping in vans, clocking in for their whole commute, leaving early while 'working'... You get the idea. Getting a union wage, I've never felt like I had any reason to take advantage, figured a fair days work for a fair wage is fair. \nOne day I get a call from hr at my new shop, asking why I put in for 39.99 hours that week. Said my 3 jobs ended in 20 minute increments, forgot to round one of them up to end in .34\nApparently this was a shit show for hr, and after a few minutes of awkwardly asking if they want me to apologize for keeping accurate time, and getting scolded for being too accurate(\"NO ONE ELSE DOES THIS\") got told to just use 15 minutes rule...\nLiterally asked 'if I show up at 6:53, my time is the same as if I start at 7:07?' \nYUUUUP!\nSo show up time is now 7:07, cut out time is 3:23. 1st (\"15\" minute paid) break is 9:23 to 9:52. Lunch (\"30\" minute unpaid) is 11:53 to 12:37.  2nd(\"15\" minute paid) break is 1:53 to 2:22\n1 hour of breaks in an 8 hour day has turned into 1:42 of breaks in a 7:46 hour day\nBeen doing this for a year, and I'd honestly feel bad if I didn't know how much money my labor is making them. The last time they let me see numbers on the job site I'm running, we're at 29.5% profit after labor and material... One of the most profitable sites in the company",

        "text": "My friend started a new company and I was interested in a position there. I already had a full time job so this would be a side job on times I was free. They were just starting out and had steep start up costs (building rental, equipment, etc).  They asked if me and another person could work for free until they could build a stable customer base. I considered it an internship in a way, but not really. I was learning some new things, it was worth trying out, and I was helping out my friend. There were 2 other owners of the company aside of my friend. One owner, I didn't get along with, let's call him G. G was a rich guy who knew nothing about about running a business and thought just having an idea, hiring people, and spending money was all it took. He talked real big, bragged about stuff I don't think were true, and whined about doing too much for the business. He was inconsiderate of others people time. He always asked people to do things for him, but when it was the other way around, he was too busy. He went on vacation once a month for a week or 2 and refused to do any work then, but will pester us on our days off. I didn't have to deal with him often and he mostly handled the marketing and what he considered \"fun stuff\" at the business. I decided it was best to avoid G and was able to for 2 months. Even though it was a volunteer job, I took it seriously and did the best I could by dependable and having a good attitude. Clients liked me and gave my friend compliments on my work. I worked well with everyone and as long as I limited my time talking to G, it was fine.   \nWithout discussing it with anyone, G decided to change the locks at the business. We didn't get a warning. Just hey guys I changed the lock, I'll give you keys 3 days later.  A client ended up scheduling an appointment for the next day and I needed the new key to get in. It took me 30 minutes to drive to the business and G wanted me to go out of my way to his home to pick it up, instead of meeting me at the business. He lived like a 7 minute drive from the business and that would add 15 minutes on top of my commute. He wouldn't answer his phone, even though I tried calling him several times, and only communicated by text. I wasn't happy with his unwillingness to meet me because he was making my job harder and using resources he didn't pay for (gas and time). He was also the one that caused the inconvenience. I tried calling him again, but he wouldn't answer. So I just text him I wasn't happy with the situation.   \nApparently this complaint rubbed him the wrong way and he text back blaming me for not notifying him earlier about the client. The time he notified us that he changed the locks and the client making an appointment was a 2 hour difference. I was getting tired of this and told him to talk to my friend. He got even more upset with my response and finally called me.   \nThe call started out with him saying my name then yelling at me, repeating things several times and barely even letting me talk. He called me disrespectful and emphasized how he was the owner. How I was the employee and I was rude to talk to him that way.   \nI called him inconsiderate and said I volunteered my time to.. for him to cut me off with \"if you don't like it, then quit.\" He just kept yelling that over and over. Anytime I tried to say anything he just yelled louder. I finally got fed up and said I'm not grabbing the key and he accused me of making it worse. His yelling turned into screaming at me and I just said f\\*\\*\\* this and hung up on him. I notified the client I couldn't meet her and instructed her how to reschedule.   \nI told my friend what happened, whom tried to salvage the situation. He explained go me this isnt uncommon behavior of G and he had done it to both owners. He never apologizes and pretends nothing happens. G reported back to my friend.. saying I blew up, it was a small squabble, and he doesn't remember what he said. He said some manipulative crap like how I was family to him.   \nI wasn't going to feed his stupid undeserving ego and be verbally abused. He made it very clear how he saw me as a lowly employee and how \"grateful\" he was.  Whatever respect I had for him was gone and all I saw was an idiotic man-child with anger issues. I took his advice, \"if you don't like it, then quit.\" I quit.   \nThey had to find another person to take my shifts since they were already operating on a skeleton crew. My friend and I are still on good terms. Unfortunately it was a loss for my friend too, even though it wasn't his fault, so I didn't inquire too much about what happened after I left.   \nTL;DR: I'm a volunteer worker. Owner yelled/screamed at me and told me to quit if I didn't like it. So I did.",

        "text": "I don’t know if this would better in r/PettyRevenge or here. I’ll let y’all decide.\n\nSeveral years ago, I briefly worked at Bdubs, a popular wing restaurant. It’s on campus so it’s utterly hell during football season. I was a hostess, so a big part of my job was inputting &amp; handing out online orders to customers &amp; delivery drivers.\n\nPart of our online order procedure was we needed the customer/delivery driver to sign the receipt for their order to confirm it was picked up. A lot of the drivers would sign &amp; write something like “pls review :)” or “5 stars :)” next to their signature. We had an ability in our system to go back through orders and review the driver, but we were usually too busy to do so.\n\nWe saw a lot of the same guys pretty regularly because it’s a large campus right near the city. Most of them understood that if the order was *just* put in, it could take anywhere from 15-30 minutes for it to be ready (wings need 12 minutes to cook + if there was anything put on them + how busy we were). But this one dude, despite being here a lot, was just an absolute dick.\n\nWe hostesses are not cooks &amp; have no control over how fast things get done. He knew this. We told him as much every single time he was in. But he would still stand right at the counter, pace back &amp; forth, huff &amp; puff and make snide comments at us while waiting for his order. Eventually it would come up &amp; he’d snatch it out of our hands &amp; storm out.\n\nThe last straw was when he snapped at the new girl &amp; made her cry. I was livid, but there was nothing I could do. After he left, it got slow for a while. I was organizing delivery receipts when I realized how I could get back at him:\n\n\nLike I said, he was a regular, and was also one of those guys that would always write “pls review :)” on their receipts. The receipts list the driver’s name on them. After finding his name on the receipt, I went through our online order tablet and found every single order as far back as it went &amp; gave this fucker a 1 star review on every single order he ever picked up from us. You want a review? I’ll give you a fucking review.\n\nFor those that haven’t done delivery: your driver rating is based on an average from all customers who rate you. A single 1 star rating could take you from a 4.9 (my average) to a 4.7-4.8 if you didn’t have a lot of runs under your belt. Idk about other apps, but I know the one I worked for required you to have your rating at a certain average to be allowed to continue driving, like no lower than 4.3 or something. Several 1 star ratings could absolutely *devastate* someone’s rating. Also, review bombing the driver has no impact on the customer.\n\nA couple days later, he’s back to pick up an order. Suddenly, he is now the kindest, politest, most patient delivery driver we’ve ever had. Strange, wonder what gave him a change of heart?\n\nThis time when when signed his receipt, he wrote “5 stars pls :)”.",

        "author": "flitzbitz",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/113ahze/datacenter_manager_forbids_systems/",
        "text": "This is an old story that happened to me. It's at an insurance company that had given me a few opportunities for MC. Other than medical folks and IT their employees wee either clerks or management so they really liked rules(not always well thought out ones) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was back in the dark ages of mainframe computers that were located in a central data-center, so remember no desktops, or smart(or even dumb) cell phones to make contact easier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had been a Systems programmer ( kind of like a mainframe SysAdmin) who had moved up from operations (physically run the datacenter) so was very comfortable there and got along great with the staff and supervisors. But the manager (one more level up. Lets cal them Manager X ) was a straight management paper pusher and didn't really understand the work flow of the room and for some reason didn't like seeing me in his computer room. (My job did officially take me in there sometimes, and so we did have access). While there I'd do  my official tasks and talk to the staff to try and identify any upcoming issues as they came up but before they became serious and impacted the production work flow. Between us we would improve their work flow and make life simpler for us all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow if there was a big issue that stopped the running of the production jobs or impacted the online terminals, Systems Programming would be contacted and someone (Usually me) would come down to resolve the problem so they could get things running again and the 20K clerks could get back to processing people's medical insurance claims. So obviously time was of the essence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day at an inter-departmental meeting with all department heads (and the head of IT) present, the data-center manager handed out a memo stating that from this point forward NO ONE (including Systems Programming, looking straight at me) could enter his data-center without being signed in by the shift supervisor. Each new entry required a new sign-in signature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was going to a bit inconvenient on a normal day, but oh well, it is his datacenter. So I'll live with it. Of course knowing that not all days are normal, I asked if there was going to be any exceptions for when there is an outage and we need to get in quickly and fix things so the rest of the company can get back to processing their medical insurance claims.  His response was that rule was in place at ALL times and there will be NO EXCEPTIONS and that includes YOU (again making a point of looking straight at me). A supervisor will will come out to the security desk and sign you in. No sign-in, no entrance !!  (NOT a bright move since this will be the time the supervisor is running around like crazy and not want to deal with signing someone in)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverthing is fine for a while. A little slower getting some projects done, but workable. Then the not unexpected data-center outage happens. (You don't know when, but you know it will happen at some point). Cue Malicious Compliance\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI go to the data-center's security desk to get signed in. (They are the entire floor and you can't get in without going thru a revolving metal turnstile). The security officer make the announcement that someone from Systems Programming needs to  be signed in over the PA(Public Address system, remember no cell phones yet). We wait a few minutes but no one shows up. I ask hime to repeat the announcement in case the supervisor didn't hear or got distracted. I also suggest that he put entries for each of attempts to reach the supervisor in his log book since I don't want them being used as a convenient scape goat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWait a few more minutes and ask the security officer to try again. No response.\n\nWait a few more minutes and ask the security officer to try again. No response.\n\nWait a few more minutes and ask the security officer to try again. No response.\n\nWait a few more minutes and ask the security officer to try again. No response.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter maybe 25-30 minutes the supervisor walks by (by chance) and sees me. He of course asks me where I've been, and why I didn't just come in. I remind him that Manager X had made a point of there being NO EXCEPTIONS and that I was only allowed in if signed in by a supervisor. He thought a second and his shoulders slumped, oh yeah I remember Manager X saying that now. I'll sign you in, and work on getting that changed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext interdepartmental meeting a new memo is given out giving Systems Programming access again without having to be signed in each time. To try and save face he also made some comments about using restraint as to frequency while doing his best not to look in my direction. \n\nGlad I asked the security officer to log all their announcements in their log book since Manager X did try and claim that they probably didn't make enough attempts. When the security supervisor came to give them a \"Talking to\" they just showed them the logbook. Security supervisor made a photocopy and shut down Manager X\n\nI have no idea how much money it cost the company to have al the customer service and data entry people sitting around for an extra half hour due to his rule",

He can just be a pain in the ass when he thinks he’s right about something!\n\nSo we recently moved into a new house.

It’s not as powerful, so no matter what setting you use, the clothes come out damp and need an extra 30 minutes in the dry-only cycle. I’ve always done all the laundry (we split the housework), but for some reason my husband got it into his head that I was “over-drying” the clothes. I explained that I was in fact normal-drying them, but he knew better. We had several increasingly heated discussions in which this guy who could count the number of washing loads he’s done in his life on one hand attempted to mansplain laundry to me, culminating in an incident where he unplugged the machine mid-cycle and said, “I’m putting my foot down about this; one cycle only”. \n\nCue the malicious compliance. I did a load of just his clothes. I used one wash and dry cycle on the drying-est setting. Of course, they were still damp by the end. But dutifully I hung them in my husband’s closet. The next day, he wanted to know why his favourite shirt hadn’t been dried properly.\nI shrugged. “You put your foot down. One cycle only.”\n\nFunny, he’s let me do the laundry in peace since then.",

        "text": "To reduce recognizability i'll avoid details as much as possible. tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nI work as 3rd level support for a company that develops and provides software for a business area, that's quite heavily regulated, a lot of our development efforts go to just keeping up with new and changing laws. Also the software, while being mainly used for one purpose, usually in one way or the other gets used throughout the whole company using it, so with bigger companies, they sometimes have multiple departments, each only supporting parts of the software in-house, basically each department of the company having their own in-house tech-support for our software.\n\nSo with this one customer. They have one main-support-team (containing, but not led by the CTO of the company) for our software and each department has their own sub-team who answer to the head of the main-team. As always, new years had brought new laws and regulations. Especially in one department, an up to now optional feature became mandatory by law starting 01.01.23. Mind you, the information about the new law was public in February 22 and our software supports this feature since the middle of 21. So enough time to configure, test and move to production with it, right? Unfortunately, as it's an extremely technical topic, i'm currently the only person in our company's support-team with in-depth knowledge. We're working on changing that, but not everyone who works in support has a background deeply rooted in software development, so it takes time.\n\nWell, starting January this one sub-department, basically a one man show, as it's a rather small department at the customer started sending support tickets \"this isn't working with the new feature\", \"that isn't working with the new feature\" and so on, 7 Tickets total, all highest priority, because \"it's an error message and we're legally required to use it\". Each and every one of the tickets I answered them the exact passage of the manual where they could read up that exact error message, explaining how it's a missing configuration on their end and exactly (with screenshots!) what to configure. These configurations are not part of any kind of support plan we offer, so work on these tickets is a \"pay by hour\" thing for the company. Never got any reply to them so considered them done with that.\n\nWell, i guessed wrong. I got another highest priority support-ticket today stating it's not working. Obviously i asked, if the configurations i sent over in the other tickets have been done, to which i get the reply, how should they know, they're just back from a multi-week vacation. I politely replied, that he should check those configurations and to not cost them unnecessary money, i would hold off working on that ticket until he checked them.\n\nThe reply i received to that basically stated, that he found it very audacious that there are now 8 open highest priority requests about that topic and the company i worked at haven't moved a finger in the month since they were submitted and that he demands i hand over those tickets to someone else in our support-team, who actually wants to do our job or he will escalate the issue to the main team.\n\nNow, you should know that this customer is one of our biggest clients, so their requests inherently get slightly higher priority on our side and also we know that they generally (with a few black sheep obviously) have a very good in-house team, so the team is pretty liberal at rooting their technical requests through to me. Because of that i get to work a lot with their main-team who handles those technical issues and the bigger the installation, the more troublesome. They enjoy working with me so much, that for the past half year or so we've been on a first name basis when communicating (including the CTO). An information, that obviously hadn't reached this poor soul yet.\n\nSo, to spare him the work of escalating the issue, according to process i wrote a formal escalation mail (using first names, petty, i know) to the lead of their main team, as well as my team-lead cc-ing the guy from the sub-team, informing them about all the highest priority tickets, including detailed information since when the feature is available, when the information about it becoming mandatory by law was publizised and when it became mandatory, compiling the answers from all the tickets into one and also sending an official, detailed by ticket, offer with which they could purchase service from us to do those configurations for them. I also included a letter from our legal team that every customer had received about half a year ago, that we are not liable for any damages they incur by not testing the feature before the legal date.\n\nAbout an hour later i got a formal answer from one of their main-team that the configurations i sent have been implemented and every issue has been resolved, the feature works as intended, thanking me for bringing to their attention that they were behind on that topic, followed half a minute later by an informal mail informing me that i don't need to worry, the next person to submit tickets on behalf of that one-person department should be much more professional.\n\nAnd the moral of the story: Don't try to threaten with authority you don't have.\n\ntl;dr: Customer-Employee threatened to report me not doing his job while he went on vacation, got fired for it.",

        "text": "Not a 100% this qualifies as malicious compliance, but here goes:\n\n8 or 9 years ago, I was baker at a popular fast food chain in my country. I always been a model employee, so one day I was surprised the manager asked me into her office. She reprimended me because I had taken a 45 minutes (instead of 30) break one day the previous week. I remembered that day, and indeed I had taken more than 30 minutes, 31 minutes to be exact, and that was because on my way back, someone had a concern that I took the time to resolve. I explained that to her but she was adamant that the system rounded to the nearest 15 minutes and that if it said 45 minutes, than there was no way I could have only been 1 min late. She made it clear that it was my fault and that the punch system is law since it can't lie.\n\nOn my next shift, I looked into it. On the punch system, there is a way to see at what time you punched. I realized that the system was not rounding the amount of time you worked/were on break, but rather the time at which you punched. What happened that day was that I punched out at 10h22, rounding to 10h15, and got back 31 minutes later at 10h53, rounding to 11h, hence the 45 minutes break.\n\nNow in my position, I had the luxury of choosing when to go on break as long as they didn't run out of anything during that time. From that day till the day I switched job a few months later, I made sure to go on break just after the cut-off, and back just before the next one. For instance, punching out at 10h08, rounding to 10h15, and back-in at 10h52, rounding to 10h45. I thus ended up with 44 minutes break, that according to the system were only 30 minutes long. One time, a supervisor told me that it seemed like I was gone for a bit longer than usual, I replied that she saw me punching in and out, and that she could go confirm in the system if she wanted to. Never heard from it after that.\n\ntldr: was chewed on because of a weird quirk of the punch system, learned how to use it to my advantage and had 14 minutes extra on all my breaks.",

        "text": "I'm a U.S. Probation Office (USPO) that specializes in preparing presentence investigations for the Federal District Court where I work.  One of the most contentious areas of preparing the presentence investigation is the guideline calculation; this is where the severity of the offense of conviction is scored according the United States Sentencing Guidelines.    \n\n\nIn a recent case there was a drug dealer (the details have been changed a bit to protect their identity) who was trafficking large quantities of heroin.  A search of his storage locker recovered about 7,000 bags (very small flat bags or \"tickets\" that hold 20-25mg) of heroin and about $350,000 in cash.  To estimate the entire drug quantity I started with the 7,000 bags and added in the estimated amount of bags that the $350,000 represented.  To do that I used the highest price that bags of heroin go for locally, $10 each, resulting in 35,000 additional bags of heroin.  For a total of 42,000 bags.    \n\n\nWhen my draft report goes out to the defense attorney and the prosecutor the defense attorney immediately starts sending me angry emails and phone calls regarding my estimate.  He's claiming that his client didn't sell individual bags of heroin, but would sell bulk amounts in 100 to 500 increments.  He'd sell 100 bag \"packages\" for $800 ($8/bag) and 500 \"bricks\" for $3,000 ($6/bag).  The defense attorney insisted, despite my attempts to talk him out of it, that I use the $3,000/500bag figure.  The prosecutor wisely stayed out of that mess.   \n\n\nSo I complied.  $350,000 at the $3,000/500bag ratio 58,333 bags, which resulted in a total of over 65,000 bags of heroin.  Well 42,000 bags results in about 840g of heroin, but 65,000 bags is 1.3kg, which sends the guy into a whole different level of drug quantity.  In the end, the guy got almost two years (21 months) more time on his guideline range because his attorney can't do math.   \n\n\nTl;dr - Just because you have a law degree doesn't mean you can do math.  Attorney nets his client 21 more months due to inability to do fractions.",

        "text": "Hi all, I posted this in r/prorevenge and r/pettyrevenge but users suggested it would probably fit better in this subreddit. There’s a bit of background here so apologies for the long read. \n\n(English is my first language I’m just terrible at writing stories, so I hope this isn’t too confusing of a read. Happy to clarify any confusion in the comments) \n\nSam - Me (26F)\nVince - my boyfriend (26M)\nWill - my boyfriends ex best friend (23M)\nBeth - my boyfriends ex best friends girlfriend (27F) \n\nBackground: I live with my bf Vince and his parents at their home. Not too long after we met, I moved in after college (I know super fast right but hey we love each other). Vince’s best friend, Will, had been living there for a few years already due to family issues. I became pretty good friends with Will during the first couple of years with all 3 of us living together. During the Covid restrictions in 2020, Will met a girl online who later became his girlfriend, Beth. This story has to do with mainly Beth.  \n\nBackground on Beth: Before even meeting her, I learned from a close friend (who called me at the time this was happening) that Beth worked with some of my friends mutual friends, and had been going around at work that day telling her co workers how my friends boyfriend picked Beth up last night and did the thang. My friends (ex) boyfriend had dated Beth for a few years in the past. My friend and her now ex boyfriend had been dating for about 2 years at the time, and this situation obviously broke off their relationship. And yes, Beth did this while in the talking/dating stage of her new relationship with Will. So already starting off with a sour taste in my mouth with Beth before even meeting her. But hey, our bf’s were best friends, and while I fucking hate cheaters, I was willing to try and make things cordial for the sake of our bf’s friendship. \n\nThroughout the time of Will living at Vince’s house with us and dating Beth, she would come over every. single. weekend. for the WHOLE weekend. Truly was treating Vince’s parents house like a weekend bed and breakfast. Will was not allowed to stay the night at her house because her parents wouldn’t let him (Beth lives with her parents as well). When she would come for her weekend get aways, she would never once acknowledge Vince’s parents. Not a hi, hello, how are you, nothing. Ever. Beth would complain about there not being food in the house for her to eat and how Vince’s mom “never cooks” so she was constantly complaining about having to order DoorDash or UberEats when she was there. Vince, Will, and I shared one bathroom and when Beth was over, she would unpack all her shit and place it all over our bathroom as if she lived there or something. Then she would use my skincare and hair products in the shower without asking. It got to a point where she was using so much of my stuff that I had to get a fucking shower caddy like I was back living in a dorm and tote it from my and Vince’s room to the bathroom. Beth and Will also would get into VERY loud arguments every weekend. It was like clock work. Beth and Will would fight so loudly the entire house could hear, and Vince’s mom had to step in a few times. One time, she threw all of Will’s dirty laundry and trash out into our hallway during a fight and refused to clean it up. Beth also seemed to have a thing for my boyfriend. When Will and Beth would fight, he would tell Vince afterwards how Beth would say things to him like “Why can’t you be more like Vince?” Or Will would tell us how Beth would frequently compare mine and Vince’s relationship with Will and Beth’s. She would also make passing comments to me like “I would totally date Vince” or “I wish Will was more like Vince”. She would even do this with our other close friends relationships. \n\nThere are many, MANY more instances like this with Beth, but to save you the boredom of the whole back story, I’ll get to the point. \n\nMy final hell fucking no with her came when I overheard her talking about me to a friend she had on speaker phone while she had Will’s door propped open. I heard this bitch gossiping with her friend about an abortion I had to have months prior. Beth only knew about this because this was an extremely difficult decision for Vince and i to make, and he trusted Will with this information because he needed someone to talk to other than me about it (I was fine and with this and aware of it, Vince asked for my permission before sharing). I over heard Beth calling me everything from a fucking bitch, to saying the most horrible and vile things I’ve ever heard about myself and abortion. She was straight up gossiping to her friend about a traumatic event in our lives that was still very fresh. \n\nPetty Revenge: so months pass and Will ends up moving out due to another incident that I actually had caused. Just to give you a quick run down, I got super drunk one night out and when I saw Beth on the ring doorbell camera I went on the audio and called her a cunt. So…. Yeah. Wish I would’ve said it to her face honestly, but yeah. Anyways…. Will moves out and me and my best friend get word from another of our friends that THEIR friend had been actively hooking up with Will. This was just maybe 2 months ago at this point. This friend of a friend Will was hooking up with lives a few doors down from him. But this isn’t the first time we’ve heard about Will cheating in the relationship. About 6 or so months prior, one of Vince’s friends let us know that Will and Vince’s friends little sister had been sending nudies and sexting back and forth via snap chat. When I found out about this, I tried having a talk with Beth to let her know. Because even tho I think she’s a cunt I follow girl code. She wouldn’t have the talk with me, saying there was no need for her and i to speak, and then a few days later is when the abortion gossip happened. So I said to heck with you then. So now, even after learning about this new hookup Will is involved with, I’m still not saying shit. Beth can continue to stay in a relationship with a cheater and not know a damn thing about it, while all of Will’s mutuals who know everything just watch. Karma did my revenge for me.",

It was a normal night when I was cleaning the dining area, we were getting ready to close at 10pm and it was about 9:30. I was out sweeping up all the peanut shells and crumbs on the floor when this family walks in, not trying to be mean or anything but this guy looked like a full on gang member wannabe, he had chain necklaces on, black beany, sagging his pants, just trying to look like he could kill you by the look on his face. Me being the guy designated to the register didn’t realize they were there because I was focusing on the dining area being clean, so when they walked in I didn’t come serve them right away. My manager looked at them and asked “y’all thinking about getting burgers tonight?” The guy looked at him and said “uh yea that’s why we came here d*ckface!” My manager looked shocked but asked “how many Pattie’s y’all thinking of gettin?” And mr gang boss looked at him and freaked out saying “LET US LOOK AT THE MENU DUMB*SS!” And everyone went silent for a few mins. Once I realized they were there I went back to help him and help my team cook up their meal. They ended up getting like 4 burgers so it was pretty easy. Once he completed the payment he said “you guys better take your time I don’t want a patty as black as him” and pointed at my black co worker. As you can probably tell that pissed off my co worker!\nCue malicious compliance \nSo when we started the order, my co worker came to me while I was putting on the condiments and told me “take your sweet time” and winked. Me knowing exactly what he wanted me to do took my sweet time getting this order done. I triple checked each ingredient to make sure it was to complete perfection. We are usually supposed to get an order done in 7 mins or less, per the “fast food” part of the job. But this guy really ticked us all off so we took “our own sweet time” and a 7 min order that night took us 26 mins to do. Yes it was a dick move on our part but we didn’t care. Once he got his food, he freaked the f*CK out at us and wanted to fight us. He looked at me as I laughed a little bit and yelled at me to fight him. Granted I’m a white boy and probably look punchable so he targeted me. My manager yelled at him to get out while reaching for his butterfly knife just in case, (all my 4 other co workers including me all had knives for this kind of situation) We kicked them out even though we all wanted to go jump the guy because of all this. Let’s just say we didn’t see the guy ever again at the restaurant…weird, we were so nice:)",

We did just that , 3 members of our team including me, worked double shifts back to back for a whole week (we didn’t get paid extra for this) and finished his work and sent him the report and thought we did something good and saved the day.\n\nA month or so later we have our review and we have to share our analytical statistics with each team member, like how many samples analysed , from which customer, the kind of tests and so on and the sales guys use this data and correlate it with how much sales happened, how we lost / got / retained a customer as part of their review. \n\nI was called to Mr X’s cabin after I shared the statistics and we were to sit together to prepare the presentation based on the data. He calls me up and opens his email and filters to mail sent by me , and I see that all mails shared by either me or my team are unread except maybe one or two here and there , and one among the unopened mails was the report he made us send after we slogged and lost one week of peace. \n\nPuzzled by this , I casually asked him - whatever happened to that customer problem, did our report help in solving it ? He said what problem, oh yeah that got resolved, it was a pricing issue. Confused , I probed on to figure out how our lab report solved a pricing issue. \nHe smirked and said, you know our big boss right of there is a problem he rattles our cages, so we have to show urgency and show him that we are doing something to solve it, so just to cool him down we send more samples or do something technical to keep him happy , when we go ahead and solve the problem without any interference.\n\nNeedless to say, I was dumbfounded and felt worthless and used. I could not wrap my head around how someone would willingly put a burden on someone else just to keep someone else happy. Forget the resources and utilities that it’s going to cost the company to do all these additional tests , if you can see someone going the extra mile for you and continue to do so thinking that it’s helping the company, the least you can do is to be honest with them in the first place.\n\nCue MC, from that point on every time we got a similar request that the heavens are on fire , the customer is raining down upon us and so on we didn’t stop everything else, we did our work normally, didn’t work more than we had to( we still worked 10 hour shifts) , but quietly when they said they wanted a report, they usually got a report. A blank document or usually some gibberish in a font our systems didn’t have. \n\nWe figured if they opened the reports and saw a blank/junk file they would call us and tell us something was wrong. \n\nGuess what, they never did. \nThe actual reports would be saved on the lan, once we finished it and if needed they could always access it later.\n\nThey just wanted us to mail in the reports as part of their power trip, we complied without getting screwed even more.",

        "text": "This story takes place in the spring of 2008 while I was a senior at my Catholic high school.  My AP English teacher periodically asked her students to write a review of the class, what we liked/disliked, what we would change, etc.  Now, if you've ever had to do something similar, you'll know that the reviews aren't really meant to be honest, but rather ego-stroking exercises for the vast majority of teachers.  My teacher was no exception to this norm.\n\nI cannot remember why I was in a bad mood that particular morning, all I recall is my pissy attitude persisted throughout the day until I got into said classroom.  Before class officially started, a friend of mine was being made fun of for having highlighter all over his khakis (one had exploded in his pocket, basically covering everything on his left side).  Our teacher then began to make fun of him as well, even dispensing with commentary throughout the rest of the class.  Needless to say, this only pissed me off more.\n\nCut to the end of class where the teacher began passing out the class review sheets.  Being in the horrible mood that I was in, I decided to write a truly honest review of the class.  I specifically mentioned how I thought it was childish for seniors to make fun of someone for something so benign, and how it was foolish and unprofessional for a teacher to pile on.  It will be important later on to mention that I did not curse, nor did I use any language that I would deem inappropriate within the review.\n\nPredictably, I was called into the vice principal's office the next morning to answer for what I had written.  The VP started off by saying that my teacher had read my review and began to cry because I had \"insulted\" her, and that she wanted me kicked out of class for the remainder of the school year (we had roughly 3 weeks left).  Calmly, I asked the VP if my review contained any profanities or any inappropriate language.  When the VP admitted the letter did not contain anything inappropriate, I simply said, \"Then what am I doing here?  You cannot hold me responsible for completing an assignment as prescribed by the teacher.\"\n\nSince I had done nothing wrong, the VP and my teacher could not kick me out for the remainder of the semester, and every afternoon until the end of the year I walked into that classroom with the largest shit-eating grin!",

        "text": "So this happened a good 15 years ago, and another story just reminded me of it.  As always I am a native English speaker sitting at a keyboard, so any typos are my own damned fault.\n\nTo keep it short, 15 years ago and some change I worked for a local computer programming company that made automation software.  Our company got bought out by a bigger national company, and after the dust settled corporate decided they were going to send \"a liaison\" down to our local office.  To \"learn how you do things to be a better bridge between offices\".\n\nAka, \"Hey new hires, teach our guy how to do your job so we can let 3/4's of you go before next quarter.\"\n\nNone of us were happy about that, but our new corporate overlords had spoken.  A month or so later, here's our \"liaison\" fellow all ready to go.\n\n\"So, show me the interface!\" he said.\n\nOh thats when we all stopped, looked at each other, and grinned.  For you see, the reason it took us so long to bring new people up to speed is that we didn't \"configure\" new projects.  \"Configure\" in this corporate speak meant \"Go check off the boxes in an interface until it does what you want.\"  Noooo my good friends, we coded everything.  Our main program accepted straight up VB files.  Not even scripts, full on files, and our new friend here was NOT a programmer.  At all.  The guy didn't know a for loop from a bubble sort.\n\nSo, as we were instructed, we started walking him through our code.  \"Here's our X policy, its the most common one we use and is about 1,500 lines of code in it's base form...\"\n\n\"Didn't you guys say you had some default policies you worked from?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, but they end up being more trouble trying to customize than it is to just write the entire thing from scratch.  So up here is where we're declaring our global variables...\"\n\nTo our friend's credit, he tried.  Oh he tried for DAYS.  And every time we thought he was about to figure something out, we intentionally switched him up to and even worse one.\n\nWe hired requiring a computer science degree, 6 months of on site gearing up, and another 6 months of shadowing before we would let ANYONE handle a project on their own.  This poor guy got the full year's worth of training in a week.\n\nTo his credit, on his last day he flat out told us he was sent down to learn how to replace us, but that he was going to tell them that we were doing a great job and if anything our timeframes were surprisingly short given what we were doing.\n\nWe ran that department for a good 5 years before the inevitable revolving door of upper management decided to bring in a new \"easier to use\" suite.\n\nPeople are STILL kvetching about \"Man I miss X, it could have done this in half the time...\" and instead of a 5 man team upkeeping everything we have multiple departments that still can't manage to fix a broken image link in the new stuff 10 years later.",

        "text": "Long context, sorry: I live in an apartment building that neighbors an antique shop and then a gym. The gym owner has 3 dogs - two are Great Danes. Last summer, the owner had hip replacement surgery, so a woman (his mom? his wife? idk) was walking both Great Danes on his behalf. \n\nI have two dogs - chihuahua and a miniature pinscher. Last summer, my dogs and I (on leashes) walked outside (in front of the antique shop) and the Great Danes saw my dogs (standing in front of the gym) and BOLTED in our direction. Before I could even react, they reached us and put 3 holes in my MinPin. Luckily, my chihuahua was unscathed. \n\nWe rushed to the vet and ultimately were fine, but we called animal control to file a case. Afterwards, the AC officer shared the gym owner's number (with his permission) and we met to speak. He was apologetic but didn't say \"this has never happened\" but assured me the dogs were headed \"back\" to doggy training. He asked that I share the vet bill when I had it and in exchange for his paying the bill, I would drop the court case. \n\nSo I did - the bill included my dog's annual vaccinations as they wouldn't move forward without having these. Despite this and 3 days stay, the bill totaled less than $1,300. IMO, it was extremely fair. \n\nI shared this with the gym owner and he said he would have the check by end of day. Well, a week later I text HIM to ask about meeting before I left town. We met and the first words out of his mouth were, \"I don't appreciate paying for your dog's annuals.\"\n\nWOW. I responded with a swift, \"YOU haven't paid anything yet - I paid. And if you disagree with the charges, we can keep the court date and you can argue your case. Perhaps the judge would agree.\" He responds with, \"No, no. That's why I made the check out in full.\" In my mind, I thought, then why would you bring this up? Did you think I would give you sympathy?\n\nRegardless, I cashed the check and dropped the case as promised. There were no follow up bills and IMO, I was extremely chill throughout this experience despite his dog's traumatizing me and my dog. My dog is now on anti-anxiety medication and I have a permanent scar on my knee from where I fought his dogs (they didn't bite me, I fell on the sidewalk). I also now carry a blade in case of emergencies. So, considering everything, he got off easy. \n\nFAST FORWARD TO NOW. The parking lot in front of the gym is owned by the gym owner, but my apartment has assigned parking in the lot - just one spot. \n\nMy brother recently came to live with me while he goes to college waiting for a dorm to open up. He has a car and he's parked in the lot - not reserved parking. I considered texting the owner, but I put it off as customers for the antique store park there frequently and the lot is RARELY full, so it wouldn't impact his clients. \n\nYesterday, my brother came home and said the gym owner approached him and told him he couldn't park there and to park in the reserved spots. Due to us only having one, he temporarily took my neighbor's spot - not an issue. \n\nI then text the owner, nicely, and explained that he's living here temporarily, leaves most days by 10 AM and would his parking there be an issue? I got a snarky response that YES it's an issue, most of his clients come early in the morning, and that the antique shop pays him for their patron's parking. He offered no compromise. As it's his lot, it's his right to deny parking to my brother passage.  \n\nBut I'm petty. \n\nThere's also street parking in front of the gym and in the past few months, the city gave apartment residents a \"pass\" to park where ever while they renovated the lot, which is still incomplete. \n\nI gave my brother my parking spot and I drove around to the front and parked dead-ass in front of his gym. I work from home so my need to use my car is purely by choice and I don't plan to drive anywhere anytime soon.",

We got most of the work done and were Chilling outside with him alongside the rest of my friends. We Were talking to him about what was he going to do when he moved in and when he was going to visit us. Then we see a lady in a Blue Flower Dress with Her dog. We don't think much of it and keep talking.\n\n(Then the Karen Sees the Moving Truck and Walks over to our parents).\n\nThis is how I remember the conversation went\n\nKaren: Um Excuse me, You are causing a lot of noise Can you please keep it down People are trying to sleep.\n\nMy Dad: Maam it's 9:30 but we are trying to be quiet, The other dads agreed with him.\n\n(Karen Got really mad when Our parents said that and started to lie)\n\nKaren: Well I'm With the State Council (Which was not true) And I can remove you from this Apartment.\n\nAt this point, I knew what was going on and what this Karan was trying to do and I decided to step in.\n\nMe: Maam look I know if this is disturbing you or anyone else, But we are trying to be quiet as we can. Could you please leave us alone?\n\nKaren: How dare you! I'm a woman and this is not how you talk to me like that.\n\n(At this point The Karan was Running out of excuses to use against my parents)\n\nKaren: Ugh Next time you see me you all will be in a lot of trouble.\n\nThen She Storms off with her dog with a Defeated look.\n\nDo you think this is the end of that, Hell no it wasn't.\n\nAfter that argument. Me and my friends decided to go inside then right out the door outside next to the stair Is Karan, She was on the phone with someone. She was saying things like... (Oh They Were ganging up on me) (They have no respect for a woman). I was kind of worried that she could be talking with the LAPD but I didn't think it was since she said Honey. But as we pass by she gave us a glinting look as we walked by. We avoided Eye contact with her while we were walking. After a few minutes, I and my friends went back down because we heading out to our friends house where all our moms were there for dinner. On the way back down We see a man heading out from the swimming pool through the gate, he walked next to us We don't think much of it and headed outside and got in the car. we were all waiting for my friend's mom and his sister. Outside we see the Karan talking to what seems like her son (Around 16 -17), Then we see the man that we saw walking out of the pool gate talking to her. Then she pointed at our van and the man walked toward us.\n\nAt this point, I Realised That this was Karans plan B of getting revenge on us.\n\n(The Man Walks up to our Van and knocks on the passenger window (Where I was sitting)\n\nMy Dad Rolls down the window and asked if something was wrong, There was.\n\nKaran's Husband: Hi Sir My wife said that you and your friends ganged up on her and Cursed at her.\n\nWhat The Fuck? Now She making up more lies to tell her husband to get us in trouble? I wanted to call the cops on her so bad. But didn't think it was a good idea.\n\nMy Dad: Your Wife Came up to us and try to start an argument with us!\n\nKaren's Husband: Well can I talk to your Boys for a minute Please.\n\nMy Dad: Look man we didn't do anything to your wife at all.\n\nKaren's Husband: She's a woman, she deserves respect!\n\nMe: Sir I'm sorry to say this But your wife is a liar.\n\nMy Dad: Can I talk to you outside sir.\n\nHer Husband agrees and they both chatted after a while. then I see both of them walk up to his wife and he asked her if he cursed at her, This is how it went.\n\nKaren: What do you mean honey he never cursed at me at all.\n\nHer Husband and My Dad Was Shocked at what she said\n\nKarens's Husband: Is that so. Then why did you say that this Man and his friends cursed at you?\n\nKaren Starts Panicking about what to say.\n\nKaren: i...uh..i....uh i errr...\n\nYep At this point karma was going to hit her real hard \n\nHer husband turn back at my dad and apologized to him for not believing him and me. after that I see my dad walk back to the car. I see Karan's Husband looking at her angry. Then he went back inside after what just happened. Then as we leave I waved at the Karan. She Was beyond angry as she sees us leave and merge onto the main street. I did hear that the both of them got divorced and moved out a couple months later.\n\nTbh I do kinda feel sorry for the guy going through that. But his Mom really deserved that.\n\nTLDR: Next time when you try to move someone, don’t let the karma get to you because it could lead to a divorce.",

        "text": "My story is simple but I thought it can still fit in this sub:  \n\n\nI never thought I'd encounter this type of person in the wild given that masks are not as politicized from where I am and that culturally we tend to be more collectivist than individualistic (I'm from Asia).  \nThat's probably why even though we're no longer mandated to wear masks, many still choose to do so and it's not that unusual to see people wearing them. I think about 50-60% of people you see outside still do. This also makes it extra annoying that this person for some reason, chose me and this moment to blurt out his unwanted advice.\n\nIn the apartment complex where I live, they've stopped allowing deliveries straight to our door so our packages have to be claimed from the lobby. I just came from getting our packages and was waiting for the elevator when this man who I don't know at all, so I can't say he's a neighbor, came up to me, looked at my mask, and said \"you know it's a beautiful day, why deprive yourself of good oxygen?\" or something like that. I didn't answer as it was this moment that the elevator arrived so we both went inside.\n\nSo the other reason that I've been wearing a mask was that I have a cold and have been coughing since that morning. My husband has also been in bed for the past 2 days with flu symptoms - fever, cough, chills. So far we're negative in the covid antigen test but we're still trying to be careful since it might still be a contagious virus. The package I claimed from the lobby was the meds I ordered for us both.\n\nI was feeling petty and I know the right thing to do was to keep it on, but I was already tired from being sick and taking care of my husband.  So I maliciously complied. Once the doors closed, I took it off and smiled at him, and said \"You're right. I have a really a bad cold and the fresh air feels good.\" It was so satisfying to see him uncomfortable so I continued \"and my husband also has the flu and has been in bed.. I hope it's not a contagious virus or something.\" at this point he wasn't looking at me anymore and just stared at the door lol. \n\nAnyway I wish it wasn't a long elevator ride so I didn't get to say anything else anymore, he had to get out first at the 4th floor (I was headed for the 6th). I'm having mixed feelings - satisfaction and guilt. I hope nobody else gets sick - that's what I'm feeling very guilty about.",

They are switching over from parking hangtags to parking stickers. Apparently an email and paper flyer went out telling us to come get the new stickers. Never received either form of notice. Since so many of us apparently weren’t in compliance with this unannounced new system, we all got these nasty stickers on our cars. Seems very punitive and excessive to me. When I confronted the property manager he tells me it’s my fault and if I don’t like the rules I can move out. Any advice to stick it to the man without being evicted?",

        "text": "So, first post excuse everything blah blah blah.\n\nMy local Michigan based large grocery store and I are now locked in a fight of malicious compliance. This local grocery store has alarms on all of their electric carts. So when you take one out of the store the alarm goes off. Being 42, and looking like I am in good health I try to avoid using these cards whenever possible. However, I am a left leg below the knee amputee. I have two herniated discs in my spine. I suffer from brain damage. I suffer from PTSD. So as I may look in good health to other people, moving quite literally hurts an ungodly amount. So doing things like walking and shopping are very difficult at times. All of this from a motorcycle accident almost 7 years ago.\n\nSo I don't like using these carts unless I have to because people look at me like I don't really need them. Well, leaving the store in the cart after paying for all of my merchandise the alarm goes off. I was the one going through so everyone around looked at me the guy in the automatic cart. It is extremely embarrassing. I call the store, talk to the manager. I am told the reason the carts have an alarm on them is to try to deter them from being stolen. I attempt to explain to the manager how embarrassing it is, but he doesn't care. So the solution that I was given, was whenever I shop I can have someone from the store take my groceries to my car. Now mind you I have called the store on three separate occasions, and have been given the exact same answer each time. \n\nWelcome malicious compliance.\n\nI was at said grocery store today with my mother doing grocery shopping. She was using a cart, I was shuffling along. My mother has fibromyalgia, and has a hard time walking at times. There was only one cart available, there's no way in hell my mother is walking. So we do our grocery shopping. While shopping I end up speaking with one of the store managers about a positive experience. So later on after checking out, we leave the store. The alarm goes off. At this point I have had it. I have my mother come back into the store. Walk to the nearest person working, and let them know I need to speak with the store manager. I point out to them that I wish to speak to the highest manager in the store. She disappears, her coworker starts giving me dirty looks. She comes back a few minutes later with a generic employee. Obviously not a manager. I inform her that is not who I asked for, I wanted to speak with whoever was the highest manager currently in the building. She disappears again, and then I see the guy I spoke with earlier that I gave the praise to. So he comes over to talk to me. I explained the situation in regards to the carts, the alarm, the phone calls, and what I have been told by the managers that I have spoken with. I then let him know that he could take my groceries to my truck. And from now on every time I come to the store, a manager will bring my groceries out to my truck. Just like I was told. Tomorrow, I'm buying a Snickers bar.",

(I've always been a snacker)\n\nI was crying a lot because of the events of transphobia that transpired so I transiently window shopped for the best trans-fats (on the drive I saw some transients) to transfer my sorrow into happiness. (LOL!)\n\nI decided to go to the nail salon/frozen yogurt combo restaurant because I honestly love Asian people and like their whole vibe you know.\n\nI came in sobbing and all these old bitties getting their fat toes painted stared at me in disgust I walked to the back counter where the fro yo is and asked for one scoop (mind you I was still whaling tears at this moment but I was doing my best). The nice lady asked me to leave as I was making a scene but I said, \"no the customer always write\". She didn't say anything but nodded and squinted her eyes at me so I thought a scoop of pumpkin pie fro yo was coming my way. Alas it was not and I got directed out by her husband who was sitting in the back initially out of my sight.\n\nThe next day at therapy I told my therapist and he told me that I should get frozen yogurt now that I'm in a better mindset. I did just that, walking in (doing my confident boy walk) and asked for pumpkin pie fro yo (one scoop). The lady took the money and got me a dollop and as I took it I winked at her and smirked and simply uttered, \"remember me?\" in a cool person tone like in the anime. She said no and then I told her about the day prior and her face turned white. I simply felt like an awesome person and shuffled out of there making sure to flip off a random grandma getting her hair washed on the way out (she didn't see me so we're all good in the morality department).\n\nTake taht! The customer ***is*** always right ;)",

        "text": "Not something I did, but something that happened to me. \n\nA buddy of mine and I went up to a casino with his grandparents. The type of place that only has 1000 different types of slot machines. My buddy and I loaded up $20 onto the card, grabbed a beer and had a good time losing it all. The grandparents lost a lot more which factors into the later events. \n\nAfterwords, the buddy, his grandparents, and I went to a local tex-mex shop to get some food. My buddy and I both like spicy food and both like sizzling fajitas. Due to the fact that they tend to be expensive and the grandparents were paying we decided to split a dish. Though with a twist, we asked the waitress if they could make it spicy. The waitress protested but didn't speak the best English. However we insisted and took our order to the back. \n\nI don't know who the cook was that day, I just have to say that I love and hate them. We all ordered a drink and were sitting around just having a good time shooting the sh\\*t. Then we heard the sizzle coming out of the kitchen doors. We knew our order was on its way and my buddy and I were excited to see what they were bringing us. I tell you what, the cook did not disappoint.\n\nThey brought out our food, put the grandparents dish down first. Then put our plate the cast iron dish of our fajita meat down and it had smoke(not steam) coming off of it. It wasn't so bad at first but before too long it was burning our eyes and it felt like we were inhaling pepper spray. The grandparents couldn't even finish their food/drinks before having to excuse themselves out. Soon, the smoke started spread out to the entire (1 room) dinning area and you could hear people coughing and sniffling. That one dish slowly cleared out an entire restaurant except for my buddy and I. It was incredibly spicy, I think the cook(chef?) used their own marinade for the steak. All we could taste was pain(both of us have a decent spice tolerance), but neither of us like to waste food so we muscled through it and finished the whole dish. It WAS what we asked for after all. \n\nWhen we finished and cleared the bill(for our table anyhow, we also left a $20 tip each) we got berated by his grandfather. He yelled and cussed at us the entire ride home but we were in too much pain to care. It's still one of our favorite memories to talk about from time to time\n\nTL;DR: My buddy and I cleared out an entire restaurant by ordering spicy sizzling fajitas  that flooded the entire room with tear gas and have no regrets.",

        "text": "Hey everybody, I have a hell of a story for you all. And for my plan to work, I will need your help!\n\nMy family and I have been with out a kitchen for an entire year. We paid a company $14,100 for kitchen cabinets, but the cabinets were delivered in horrific condition. I tried to work with the company, and at first it seemed though they were taking care of it. \n\nI was given a date for delivery of the replacement cabinets, but the company wanted to take my other cabinets away (at first I was told to dispose of the cabinets but they changed their game plan on me)\n\nAs soon as the old cabinets were taken away, they sent me an email saying I would not get any cabinets and they told us that they will not refund our money $13,800 ($300 was delivery) unless we signed an NDA.\n\nThe NDA basically said we will not sue, tell the news media, or go on line leave reviews, tell our story, etc. We also had to promise to never purchase from them or their other companies. Now mind you, they’re HUGE, and they own a lot of companies and sell a lot of known products. \n\nIn exchange, all they were going to do was give me back my money. That’s it.\n\nIf we broke the terms, we would have to pay them back damages of, you guessed it, $13,800.\n\nSo here’s where the malicious compliance comes in:\n\nI am going to release my story to the world. I already started. Check my history. I started a YouTube as well, check my comment history.\n\nMy plan is to tell the world my story and release my documents little by little as I build attention. Once I have amassed a following, I will send a letter to the cabinet company and tell them that I am willing to sign the NDA, under one circumstance.\n\nIf I sign, they MUST tell everybody on r/maliciouscompliance who they are and why they have a policy like this in place!\n\nIf they don’t, I will tell everybody the truth. I have a documentary that I will release. \n\nI have already found reviews of others with similar or just as messed up situations because of this same company. I have contacted these people. I am trying to work with all of them to have them join us in asking this company WTF!\n\nI have found countless employee reviews about poor work conditions, only a number not a person, expendable employment. The employees mention the poor quality is due to over worked conditions. And unrealistic goals. They can’t go home until they smash every cabinet together first.\n\nI have major concerns about the waste. Every time a cabinet or door is replaced, they tell the consumer to throw the other item away. They replace these things 2, 3, 5 times! Each time, you dispose, they give another crappy replacement.\n\nThere is a story to tell and a lot to expose. Help me amass the attention I need to get my story told so that we can pull off the most epic malicious compliance in history!",

So cold, that at some point, the adhesive on my parking permit fell from the windscreen into the foot well. When i finally return to the world, I go to my van, and see a parking ticket for the previous night. My van hadn't moved in two weeks, and the same parking attendant everyday, just following the rules, hits me with a £75 fine.\n\nI call the company up and get them to check their payment record, my £25/month permit was in date, and they have my vehicle details. They told me the rules on the signs are clear, and if you don't display a ticket, you will receive said fine. No ifs or buts.\n\nI tried to fight it further and further, going nowhere. With my stubbornness, it ended up costing me nearly £200.\n\nThen it dawned on me. If they're not checking a system and just looking for a permit, why am I still paying for it?\n\nI called up and cancelled my monthly renewal, and kept hold of the permit. That was about 21 months ago. It's so bleached from the sun you can hardly make it out. But it's valid in every way that matters to the parking attendant, and I keep saving an extra £25/month.",

The second required some sort of ID though, driver's license, employee badge, something like that. Or your inviter would have to meet you out here and confirm to us in writing. Note that we didn't keep your document, we just needed to put down your name and make a real quick glance of your face and photo.\n\nMost of our visitors had no problem with the protocol. Some would voice their frustration but still comply. Well not this special guy. He got aggressive and demanded an explanation about the need for an ID when he was standing right here. Couldn't seem to grasp it however we tried, and he got increasingly louder. He didn't want his inviter to meet him outside because \"this is wrong.\" Security was ready to see him out when he screamed at us to call the cops, because we needed to be arrested and taught a lesson on civil rights.\n\nCalls were made, cops came quickly, and he went out in cuffs. Turned out they already had a warrant, just weren't in a hurry to get him. Icing on the cake was that he was here for a job interview.",
