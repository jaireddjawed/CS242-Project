We offer a platform and tool for people to track the trash they pick up using their smartphones. \n\nOur product focuses on tracking the individual litter pieces and composition as people clean up by taking a photo of each piece. However, we've gathered a lot of feedback from our users on how disruptive it is for the clean-up community. \n\nIn light of that, I'm trying to gather some insights into how we could better fit your community's needs.\n\nIf you're open to me asking you a few questions and having a bit of a chat, please shoot me a DM or chat message! \n\nSome topics we'd like to learn more about are: what motivates you to clean up, what tools you use, how you determine where to go, etc. Also, no worries if you haven't used our product, we're looking to better understand the DeTrashed community. \n\nLastly, I just wanted to shoot a general thank you all for doing what you do!\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "sorry for not having a picture, i’m in the habit of trash picking once a week around my oldest child’s school when my younger children and i are waiting for his dismissal. i have the little ones listen to a story podcast from my phone in the car while i put on my gloves and mill about nearby plucking debris from the area. we’re americans temporarily located in a beautiful coastal city in southwest sweden. strong winds come off the sound and blow litter that is caught by the dense hedges that grow here. we in the states could learn a lot from sweden’s recycling program but i am shocked at how much folks litter here. i sense there’s a general feeling that the city hires trash cleaners and it’s their job to do or something? anyway, people even tuck their trash into these dense hedges that i mentioned: whole bags of takeout refuse, bottles, cans, cig packets, diapers, dip rounds, etc disappear into the bushes until fall/winter comes and with the thinning leaves one can see all the trash accumulated in the undergrowth. this is what i cleared today - one side of a block. being an adult in the world is complicated but seeing a messy side of the street, spending a fast 40 minutes showing it love, and seeing the clean result is so purely satisfying in a way that most of my life is not. glad to recently find this community. happy thanksgiving, all-",

So then I got [This Grabber that doesn't Fold](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Ettore-36-in-Grip-n-Grab-Reaching-Tool/3390598) which I thought would be good, because the 'folding' part is what broke on my original.  But this Grabber is like a huge step down compared to the grabby cups on the Gopher.   So, I went and bought another Gopher. But again the 'folding' part of it continues to be my biggest problem.  \n\nI've spent more than an hour looking at grabbers now, and feel really silly about it.  I'd just like  a non-folding good grabber that doesn't cost $60... because I pick up really gross stuff sometimes. And I'm totally over thinking this...  \n\nSo, what kind of picker do YOU have, and how did YOU decide on it?  Would you recommend it?  Is it less than $60?  TIA!",
