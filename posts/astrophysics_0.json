        "text": "It'd be a massive undertaking. Huge systems that utilize the natural draft / syphoning effect, boring tunnels through areas of stagnant lithography to syphon cold air at high points of the space facing side of the planet to low points on the star facing side.\n\nIgnore the limits of laziness, assume a species with a go-getter attitude, some elbow grease, and Von Neumann systems set up to make things a little easier. Whatever it takes.\n\nAnd the same in the opposite direction, except you'd start at low points on the hot side and use up-draft to expell the hot air into the cool side at higher points.\n\nIn this way, you could harvest secondary solar energy in the form of wind turbines in the draft and syphon tunnels .\n\nYou could potentially do direct transfers, skipping a power grid, to do work such as a rail system for constant recirculating transportation.\n\nYou might need a super computer the size of the planet itself to simulate the fluid dynamic models to get an idea of what kind of weather systems this might brew but....hopefully the right organization of entries and outries, some tunnels large, some of capillary scale, whatever it takes to end up with roughly temperature glove.\n\nWhile we're at it, this species has some serious geoengineering capabilities, throwing up a synthetic magnetosphere strong enough to deflect the intense radiation on the star facing side of the planet.\n\nAnd uhhhh, the tunnels are vacuum insulated. Hopefully I covered the most pressing bases with my disclaimers.",

So, everything I’m going to say I -believe- is correct but I could be wrong. \n\nSo in my understanding, stars are some of the heaviest objects out there excluding black holes. And the more mass, the bigger the star. And with that logic , I -think- other celestial bodies could turn into stars if they were to gain the appropriate mass. \n\nSo I guess this question is like a 1.5 question. So, as we know we are the only planet out there that has life. And we happen to have a lot of it. And we all have mass, and are on the earth. So half question is, do we contribute to the earths overall mass?\n\nLet’s say for this question it’s both. So I’ll phrase the question, and answer it with a “if life contributes to earths overall mass” or “life does not contribute to earths overall mass”.\n\nThe actual question:\n\nHow many living organisms would have to exist on the earth for it to turn into a star?\n\n\nEven if it’s not real, theorize on how it could maybe? Cause I have zero clue if this is something we could have the answer to.",

        "text": "While describing the concept of the big bang and universe expansion to my son and the difficulties with the observations from the James webb telescope of fully formed galaxies at the limits of observation, it dawned on me that there may be an explanation for the conundrum. \n\nMy hypothesis is that at the time of the big bang the gravitational singularity that existed at its genesis  occurred from both a matter and an anti-matter state simultaneously.  Given the repulsion associated with antimatter/matter as described in the link provided, the two subsequent expansion loci were thrust apart while in the process of individually expanding such that the antimatter universe was always at the extreme outer periphery of our expanding universe.  \n\nNow, looking outward from the milky way, we see further back in time, as confined by the speed of light but at some point our expanding universe ends and we begin to see the outer fringes of the antimatter universe.  Gravitational lensing and gravitational space curvature produces the illusion that the antimatter universe surrounds us, rather than being unidirectional in alignment with its initial trajectory at the time of nascent expansion.\n\nIf this theory is correct, then the James webb telescope should discover other well formed galaxies even further removed from its current extreme observation data sets.  The other supporting observation would be detection of matter antimatter energy bursts where the two universes collide at their extreme periphery.\n\nDisclaimer:  I am a Ph.D. biochemist, not an astrophysicist.  I am simply intrigued by the science.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[antimatter gravity and rapid universe expansion](https://phys.org/news/2011-04-antimatter-gravity-universe-expansion.html#:~:text=As%20Villata%20explains%2C%20the%20current,antimatter%20mutually%20repel%20each%20other)",

        "text": "**TL;DR: Is there any scenario - however unlikely - in which a very large object can stably orbit a planet really rather slowly?**\n\nHello. Sorry if I'm in the wrong place, or doing a thing that this place doesn't like, but I don't know who to ask.\n\nI'm a living cliché writing a fantasy novel. I've worked out this whole cult thing where a group of people who worship a moon. What I **want** to have as a situation is something that appears **roughly** the size of our moon from the planet's surface, but have it orbit the planet either once per year, or once per very-slightly-more-or-less-than-one day. The goal is to have the most committed of the cult be nomads that strive to always be beneath the moon, so are constantly travelling around the planet to do so.  \nOnce per year is preferable, so that it's always there. The latter is fine as a fallback option, because they can say they only need to keep up with it enough to be beneath it at midnight or whatever.\n\nIf it would only work by being something that would appear much smaller than the moon, that's Ok, but it needs to be something that people would notice with the naked eye. I would really like it to be visually distinct from stars, but Polaris was a pretty big deal for wayfaring in the real world so if needs must...\n\n(Follow up question: if it IS a larger object, assuming a vaguely Earth-like atmosphere, would it be visibile during the day, too?)  \n\n\nThe size and distance from the planet do not matter - it just needs to be a thing they can look up at and think is a god or something. The planet can also be a different size to earth. I'm not looking for precise numbers or exact scenarios, or even whether it's likely. I only need it to be theoretically possible. It's a FANTASY story, but I much prefer hard magic systems. Bending rules and possibilities is par for the course, but I wouldn't want to include something that is so far from possible that it's just funny to people who know about these things.\n\nSuspension of disbelief etc...\n\nAnyway - thanks very much for anyone who can provide insight!",

And yes, I know the asteroid belt was almost certainly not a shattered planet.)\n\nQuestion is this: hypothetically, if Earth was near the edge of the conservative inhabitable zone, and Venus was closer to the middle (where Earth actually is), could a small planet (size of the moon) fit between Venus and Mercury near the inner edge of the zone?\n\nIf so, if this hypothetical planet ended up in orbit around Earth, could that push Earth and Venus closer to the Sun?\n\nAdditional questions:\n\nAssuming the greater habitable zone, what kind of conditions would be necessary to have a habitable planet where the asteroid belt is? I’m leaning toward small, but very dense with a thick atmosphere. Does that make sense?\n\nWhat kind of atmosphere would Mars need to have to be habitable? \n\nWhat kind of conditions would be needed for a small planet (moon) to be habitable near the inner edge of the zone?\n\nIf there was a planet where the asteroid belt is, and the moon suddenly appeared close to it, then used it as a sling shot to head back toward the sun, could that cause that planet to shatter? \n\n\nCould having a moon sized object travel past it ignite a planet’s atmosphere? Or otherwise damage it?\n\nCould a moon sized planet lose its atmosphere on such a trip?\n\n\nCould suddenly having a moon cause Pangea to break into today’s continents?\n\n\nThank you so much!

With that said, we are obviously moving at incredible speeds and not truly at rest. Would we experience time differently compared to people on earth if we were truly at rest?",

For example, there's large metal object in orbit traveling at 18,000 km/h or whatever, and then a \"space cleaning\" net or similar type of device travels near it and collects it. If they're are both traveling at similar speeds, is it possible that it would work? Obviously the kinetic impact of a slow moving object could be destroyed by a tiny metal object traveling fast, but if they were at similar speeds I think it would be possible. If enough of it were to be collected, it would become massive and fall into low orbit and then burn up in the atmosphere.\n\nCan this be done?",

Let’s say if multiverse theory is true? there must be an existence where something can come from nothing. In other words, I think we are not the main universe and we’re created by “another universe or dimension” we look at the universe as if everything revolves around us but on a much more massive scale. We were made from it, and “it”must be something completely different from our very own existence. That place we can’t “fathom”\n\nI imagine that the creator is absolutely nothing! A dimension or alternate universe that doesn’t exist because it’s absolutely nothing and it’s cosmic influence allows it to create everything but itself, that’s why there can be so many multiverses. It can create everything but itself, it has to stay the existence of absolutely nothing. If there are dimensions of  us and everything existing, there has to be one where an absolute nothing exists. If that works in negatives then we can’t be the main universe because everything doesn’t exist in our universe, And absolute nothingness doesn’t exist in our universe either (for all we know)\n\nYin and Yang or anything that has to deal with balance, like positive and negative. One reality where nothing exists and one where everything exists. our creation starts when one of those (the absolute nothing) made another reality (the absolute something).\n\n I wonder if it’s creation of absolutely everything created itself a universal consciousness, then it “woke up” and made every fabric of our existence in every multiverse? \n\nI don’t know man it sounds bonkers but it would be insane if that’s where it “began”",
