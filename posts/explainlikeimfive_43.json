Most of my friends I grew up with have several children by age 23 often 3-5. This is with no life experience and no income other than government support. I’m pretty sure it’s intentional or at worst indifference, as access to reproductive care is easily accessible in my country.\n\nNow, me and my partner are mid 20s and have a combined income that puts us in the top 3%. We’re sort of want kids but are probably going to put it off until we’re mid-late 30s. All of our friends in a similar income situation are the same, and think children in your 20s is unthinkable.\n\nWhy is this? It would make sense that people with less money would be more worried about having kids, not the other way around.",

This got me thinking about food and water consumption in an emergency/famine situation where any given amount of food/water you have on you may be the only sustinance you might have access to for a prolonged period of time.\n\nWhat would be the best way to go about ingesting this? All at once or spread out? I understand that when considering food, surpluss calories are stored as fat for later use so is there any benefit to just eating all the food you have on you at once for \"later use\" or spacing said calories out? This is with the understanding that your body will ultimately go into ketosis and begin burning body fat eventually regardless of how you ingested the calories initially. A benefit i could see for eating it all at once would be to avoid insulin spikes/troughs and subsequent hunger pangs between small meals but i could be well off.\n\nHow would the approach differ depending on the amount of food available and the body fat % of the individual?\n\nThanks.",
