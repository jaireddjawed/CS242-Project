        "text": "The Expanding Vibrational Web Theory\r  \n\r  \nIn the Expanding Vibrational Web Theory, the universe is born from a singularity, a single point of infinite density and energy. This singularity contains the potential for all the matter and energy in the cosmos, and as it expands, it releases energy in all directions and dimensions, creating a vibrant and interconnected web of existence.\r  \n\r  \nAs the energy flows outwards from the singularity, it begins to condense and manifest as matter through a process known as spontaneous symmetry breaking. This matter, in turn, generates energy in various forms, such as electromagnetic radiation, gravity, and weak and strong nuclear forces. As the universe expands, this matter-energy interplay continues, creating an intricate and interconnected dance between the two.\r  \n\r  \nAt the quantum level, particles in this universe are not discrete entities but rather exist as probability waves, which can manifest as particles when observed. These probability waves are connected through a vast and complex network of vibrating energy, forming the fabric of spacetime itself. This energy web is reminiscent of a multi-dimensional spider's web, where each strand represents a flow of energy that vibrates at different frequencies and connects to other strands, ultimately weaving the entire tapestry of the cosmos.\r  \n\r  \nQuantum entanglement, a phenomenon in which the states of two or more particles become interdependent regardless of the distance between them, supports the idea of a connected vibrational web. The instantaneous exchange of information between entangled particles suggests that the energy web is not limited by the conventional constraints of spacetime.\r  \n\r  \nAs the universe continues to expand, the vibrational web stretches and adapts, maintaining its interconnected nature. This ever-evolving network of energy and matter forms the basis for the emergence of more complex structures, such as galaxies, stars, and ultimately, life.\r  \n\r  \nThe Expanding Vibrational Web Theory proposes that the universe is not only expanding in size but also in complexity, as the interactions between energy and matter give rise to new and more intricate patterns. This idea is consistent with the concept of an \"emergent universe,\" where higher levels of order arise from the interactions between simpler components.\r  \n\r  \nIn conclusion, the Expanding Vibrational Web Theory offers a new perspective on the origins and nature of the universe, focusing on the interplay between energy and matter, and the interconnectedness of all things at the quantum level. This theory emphasizes the importance of the energy web that permeates the cosmos, highlighting the fundamental role of vibrational connections in shaping the fabric of reality.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\nwe could explore the possibility that the vibrating energy web not only connects particles through quantum entanglement but also carries the force of gravity across spacetime. \n\nwe could explore the possibility that gravitons could be considered as unique vibrations or frequencies within the energy web that interact with matter. \n\nwe could explore the emergence of spacetime from the interconnected energy web. It could propose that the fabric of spacetime arises from the collective behavior of the vibrations within the web, with each strand representing a unique combination of energy and matter interactions. \n\nwe could explore that the vacuum energy density is regulated by the continuous exchange and interplay between energy and matter within the vibrational web, preventing it from reaching the extremely high values predicted by quantum field theory. \n\nwe could explore if dark matter and dark energy could be associated with specific types of vibrations or patterns within the energy web, which could account for their elusive properties and dominant role in the universe's expansion.",

        "text": "Hello, I am a premed (physics BA) student. I have been on the ropes between being a physics/engineering student or premed recently and I am asking for advice. First a bit of a backstory: My interest between physics and medical professions sprung from my third year of high school. I always enjoyed hearing something new that occurred in science and had a strong science background. So I decided to become a physics major while doing my medical school prereqs. I enjoyed the anticipation of learning both subjects, but as I grew I found myself wanting to change my trajectory. I think I watched medical shows and purged youtube and other media of medical professions and etc because I was interested in medicine but now it feels as if I watch and interact with such material because I am trying to convince myself this is the field for me. Now that I am about to transfer schools for a BA in physics, I find myself a bit lost. I mean when I wanted to become a doctor I thought of the prestige, the title, and the money that would change the lives of me and my family as we grew up relatively poor. However, when I look at physics and engineering I think of the amazing content I can go over, and the areas of science I can revolve myself around, it would even give me time to pursue a double major in philosophy(personal interest) since I would not have to worry about doing prerequisites, the MCAT. clinical volunteering, and whatever else Medical school requires. I lean more toward applications in physics. With a medical profession, I was already set on what my role would be in the field, but now I feel as if I hit a position in my life where it feels like I am inclining toward where I want to go but don't know where I will be going, and I don't even know what I will tell my parents when I do go. So, any advice? From field to switching, to life advice. \n\nP.S. I support any constructive criticism, the harsher the better.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/11r4sjb/natural_units_defined_using_einsteins/",
        "text": "For Einstein's 144th birthday and in accordance with the Einsteinian principle that \"nature is the realization of the simplest that is mathematically conceivable\", are there any insights to be gained from defining Planck units using Einstein's gravitational constant *κ* instead of Newton's gravitational constant *G*?\n\nBriefly, Planck units are a system of natural units proposed by Max Planck, defined by arranging four fundamental universal physical constants to give expressions for the base quantities length (dimension L), mass (M), time (T), and temperature (Θ). These four universal constants are:\n\n*c*, the speed of light in vacuum (maximum speed of information/causality),\n\n*ħ*, the quantum of angular momentum, originally Planck's constant *h* (*ħ* = *h*/*τ*^([1]), the quantum of action,\n\n*G*, the Newtonian gravitational constant, and\n\n*k*(subscript)B, the Boltzmann constant (written here as ^(*k*)B due to formatting limitations), which can be thought of as a proportionality factor between energy and temperature, or as the 'quantum of entropy' (^(*k*)B × log(*x*)).\n\nTheir respective dimensions are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Constant|Dimension|\n|:-|:-|\n|*c*|L T^(-1)|\n|*ħ*|L^(2) M T^(-1)|\n|*G*|L^(3) M^(-1) T^(-2)|\n|^(*k*)B|L^(2) M T^(-2) Θ^(-1)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nValues for length, mass, time, and temperature units^([2]) are determined by arranging combinations of the above constants to isolate the respective relevant dimensions and setting the numerical values of all four to 1 when expressed in terms of those units.\n\nA common alternative convention in particle physics and cosmology is to use 'reduced' Planck units which set 8*πG* = 1, as this simplifies the Einstein field equations, the Poisson and Friedman equations, and the Einstein-Hilbert action, along with reducing or eliminating many other ubiquitous factors of 4*π* throughout theoretical physics arising from the fact that 4*π* is the surface area of a unit sphere.\n\nInterestingly, if we choose to normalize Einstein's gravitational constant (*κ* = 8*πG*/*c*^(4), dimensions of L^(-1) M^(-1) T^(2))^([3]) instead of *G*, the expressions for the resulting base units (which I'll refer to here as Planck-Einstein units) turn out to be extraordinarily elegant:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Dimension|conventional Planck units|reduced Planck units|'Planck-Einstein' units|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|length (L)|√(*ħG*/*c*^(3))|√(8*πħG*/*c*^(3))|√(*ħκc*)|\n|mass (M)|√(*ħc*/*G*)|√(*ħc*/8*πG*)|√(*ħ*/*κc*^(3))|\n|time (T)|√(*ħG*/*c*^(5))|√(8*πħG*/*c*^(5))|√(*ħκ*/*c*)|\n|temperature (Θ)|√(*ħc*^(5)/*G*)/^(*k*)B|√(*ħc*^(5)/8*πG*)/^(*k*)B|√(*ħc*/*κ*)/^(*k*)B|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMathematically, the values of these units differ from conventional Planck units by a factor of √(8*π*) (≈ 5.01) and are identical to those of reduced Planck units, the sole difference being between the choice of gravitational constants normalized (8*πG* = 1 vs *κ* [= 8*πG*/*c*^(4)] = 1) and the resulting elegance of defining expressions for the latter. This elegance continues to hold for derived units as well:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Dimension|conventional Planck units|reduced Planck units|'Planck-Einstein' units|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|area (L^(2))|*ħG*/*c*^(3)|8*πħG*/*c*^(3)|*ħκc*|\n|volume (L^(3))|√(*ħ*^(3)*G*^(3)/*c*^(9))|16√(2*π*^(3)*ħ*^(3)*G*^(3)/*c*^(9))|√(*ħκc*)^(3)|\n|density (L^(-3) M)|*c*^(5)/*ħG*^(2)|*c*^(5)/64*π*^(2)*ħG*^(2)|1/*ħκ*^(2)*c*^(3)|\n|pressure (L^(-1) M T^(-2))|*c*^(7)/*ħG*^(2)|*c*^(7)/64*π*^(2)*ħG*^(2)|1/*ħκ*^(2)*c*|\n|force (L M T^(-2))|*c*^(4)/*G*|*c*^(4)/8*πG*|1/*κ*|\n|power (L^(2) M T^(-3))|*c*^(5)/*G*|*c*^(5)/8*πG*|*c*/*κ*|\n|energy (L^(2) M T^(-2))|√(*ħc*^(5)/*G*)|√(*ħc*^(5)/8*πG*)|√(*ħc*/*κ*)|\n|momentum (L M T^(-1))|√(*ħc*^(3)/*G*)|√(*ħc*^(3)/8*πG*)|√(*ħ*/*κc*)|\n|frequency (T^(-1))|√(*c*^(5)/*ħG*)|√(*c*^(5)/8*πħG*)|√(*c*/*ħκ*)|\n|acceleration (L T^(-2))|√(*c*^(7)/*ħG*)|√(*c*^(7)/8*πħG*)|√(*c*^(3)/*ħκ*)|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf the four base and ten derived 'Planck-Einstein' units above, only five have expressions with exponents of magnitude &gt; 1 (and none &gt; 3), as compared to almost every single one of the 14 corresponding conventional Planck unit expressions. The pure beauty of the Planck-Einstein force simply being the inverse of the Einsteinian gravitational constant is especially impressive, as well as the elegance of the Planck-Einstein area as the simple product of the three fundamental constants, along with expressions for Planck-Einstein time, length, energy, momentum, and frequency all being mere transformations of each other.\n\nNote that these units, being identical in value to the reduced Planck units already in use throughout much of the literature, effectively also set 8*πG* = 1 and thus simplify the same equations as well (Einstein field equations, Einstein-Hilbert action etc.).\n\nAs for theoretical significance, if any; it's generally accepted that a viable theory of quantum gravity is likely to become relevant at distances on the same order as that of the Planck scale, but that the actual numerical factor of this order of magnitude is trivial. The paradigmatic example of the scale at which relativity and quantum phyics overlap is that of the mass at which a body's Schwarzschild radius (*r*ₛ = 2*Gm*/*c*) is equal to its Compton wavelength (*λ* = *h*/*mc*): this mass is √(*hc*/2*G*), which differs from the conventional Planck mass and our Planck-Einstein mass by factors of only √*π* and 2*π*√2 respectively.\n\nThat said, the simplicity of expressions for our Planck-Einstein units may hint more closely at some underlying truth than the conventional unreduced units do, given that it's unclear whether the present choice of normalization factors are necessarily optimal. It may be that, in much the same way that *ħ* is now thought of as more 'fundamental' than Planck's original unreduced constant *h*, Einstein's gravitational constant *κ* should perhaps be understood as the more fundamental constant and Newton's gravitational constant *G* thought of as its special nonrelativistic case, instead of the other way around as is currently done in pedagogical contexts.\n\nAs Einstein said^([4]):\n&gt; \"It can scarcely be denied that the supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.\"\n\nOr, as often paraphrased: \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\"\n\n**TL;DR**\nif we define natural units using *κ* instead of *G*, the resulting expressions are incredibly elegant. Does this mean anything for what constants should be considered fundamental, or does the actual numerical factor of the Planck scale not matter?\n***\n1. [Embrace](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto) [the](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/pdf/Mathhorizons/apr12_aftermath.pdf) [tau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG7vhMMXagQ) ☯️! I've used *π* throughout in honour of Einstein's birthday happening to fall on Half-Tau Day (aka Pi Day for the less enlightened :&gt; ), but in keeping with our theme of simple mathematical beauty it should be noted that the ratio of a circle's circumference to its radius is the clear logical choice of circle constant, given that this is literally how a circle is defined. The brilliant (and aptly named) [Terence Tao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao) has made the intriguing observation that, as the generator of log(1) (as in Euler's elegantly sublime identity *e*^(*iτ*) = 1), [2*πi* may well be *the* fundamental circle constant](https://qchu.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/pi-is-still-wrong), though the magnitude itself of |2*πi*| (i.e., *τ*) is most relevant in real number contexts.\n[1]: https://redd.it/11r2kcg \"Embrace the tau ☯\"\n2. Electromagnetic units were not included in Planck's original proposal. Some later authors have chosen to normalize either the electric constant *ε*₀ or Coulomb constant *k*ₑ for this purpose as neither is based on a particular prototype object or particle but on the properties of free space itself, but it may be more likely to be just common sense across the universe to choose to normalize the electron charge -*e*, given that it's the fundamental quantum of particle charge. (I specify the *electron* charge as opposed to the *elementary* charge as this would address [a certain unfortunate accident of history](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/567:_Urgent_Mission).) One objection sometimes given to normalizing *e* is that *e*^(2)/*ħc* ≈ 1/137, hence all three of *e*, *ħ*, and *c* cannot be simultaneously set equal to 1, but this understanding is based on the relation that the fine-structure constant *α* = *k*ₑ × *e*^(2)/*ħc* ≈ 1/137, meaning that [the value of the *k*ₑ coefficient itself can be understood as equal to the fine-structure constant *α*](https://web.archive.org/web/20220106202118/http://old.ihst.ru/personal/tomilin/papers/tomil.pdf) if *e* is normalized instead.\n[2]: https://redd.it/11r2kcg \"Electromagnetic units were not included in Planck's original proposal\"\n3. [Depending on one's choice of dimensions for the stress-energy-momentum and/or metric tensors](https://dx.doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/jmqnu), *κ* may be given as 8*πG*/*c*^(4), 8*πG*/*c*^(2), or even 8*πG*, but the prevailing convention (and most useful for our purposes) is the first.\n[3]: https://redd.it/11r2kcg \"Depending on one's choice of dimensions for the stress-energy-momentum and/or metric tensors\"\n4. He also once said that \"matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor\". Ironically, in spite of the exceptional mathematical beauty of Einstein's theory of general relativity, [Einstein was initially dismissive of the idea that, all else being equal, elegance and mathematical simplicity should help guide theoretical considerations](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Einstein_simplicity.pdf). This was a misstep which cost him valuable time in the final formulation of his theory and could have lost him priority to then-rival, mathematician David Hilbert. It was only after revisiting the Riemann curvature (a promising path which he had discarded three years before, prioritizing excessively restrictive physical considerations over mathematical ones) that he was able to consummate his work. The experience gave him [a lifelong appreciation for mathematical simplicity as a heuristic for theory choice](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/einstein-philscience/#SimTheCho) which culminated in his monumental 1933 Herbert Spencer philosophy of science lecture, a hard-earned understanding alluded to in the semi-autobiographical nature of his quote: \"Our experience hitherto justifies us in trusting that nature is the realization of the simplest that is mathematically conceivable.\"\n[4]: https://redd.it/11r2kcg \"He also once said that \"matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor\"\"",

The thing is, I didn't know I'd like physics so much until I took the conceptual physics class my school offers. I'm going to be taking AP Physics 1 next year but I'm worried that I'm never going to be quick enough at learning or that I'm too behind. I have an A- in my class right now and I've already started studying for AP 1. I'm scared that I won't succeed because I'm not a great test taker although I study a lot and take good notes. I'm also not the best at math. I can do basic algebra, geometry, and trigonometry, but I've never gotten higher than a B in a math class. I really want to succeed though. There are others my age that know far more than me and I feel so stupid just getting started. I'd like to know if I even have a chance at being able to minor in this field.",

        "text": "I am desperately seeking career advice to help me find the right path for my future! I'm already 21, and sometimes I worry that I'm falling behind. After two grueling years pursuing a major in agriculture at university, I dropped out feeling lost and unsure of my true passions.\n\nSince then, I've been on an exhilarating journey of self-discovery, and it's been a rollercoaster ride of excitement and worry. I've discovered a love for various types of arts, music, biology, aerospace, and building things! It's been a wild ride, and while having many interests is great, it's also a source of concern for me. I'm not sure if it's a strength or a weakness to have so many passions, and it's making me anxious.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've tentatively decided to pursue mechanical engineering because it is a sort of general field and you can specialize later on, but my heart is also drawn to the fascinating world of physics. It all started when I realized the necessity of physics in the creation of things, and I've been hooked ever since. The more I delve into it, the more I find everything related to it absolutely mesmerizing - from the existence of everything to objects falling, time, space, light, and more.\n\nNow, I'm in a panic because I can't decide between pursuing a Bachelor's degree in physics or mechanical engineering. Both fields excite me, and I feel like I'm at a crossroads. I don't want to make the wrong decision and end up regretting it later.\n\nI'm really hoping that you can help me out and provide some much-needed guidance. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story!",

        "text": "I'm coding a 2d physics engine for the game I'm working on. I have bouncing all coded, such that when an object hits another, its velocity in one axis or the other is reversed and it bounces off. However, I also want it to affect the other object by giving it a velocity related to the angle of incidence.\n\nAssume (temporarily) that both bodies (Body A and Body B) are perfectly rigid and will transfer 100% of the energy they have, like spheres on a newton's cradle. Suppose Body A has kinetic energy and is moving toward Body B, which is perfectly still. How does the angle of the travelling vector affect the energy transferred? Should I simply impart Body A's travel vector onto Body B without consideration for the angle?\n\nCase two is one in which Body A and Body B are travelling in the same direction, but Body A is travelling faster than Body B and is on course to collide with it. Assuming that I treat the objects as equals in the interaction without an \"instigator\", in the case above, B would impart its own movement onto A despite how this should not happen. I could add some extra code to figure out which object is \"pushing\" the other, but reality doesn't have \"extra code\". Collisions simply work the way they do, and if I can reflect that in my simulation, that would be ideal.\n\nI saw an episode of mythbusters a long time ago that kind of throws a wrench into my idea of how these collisions work, anyway. In the episode, they conclude that a collision between two cars going 100mph each toward each other does not result in the same collision as if one car was going 200mph toward a static object. This is unexpected, and I don't really know how to reflect this in my simulation.\n\nThank you for reading and considering my questions. Any answers would be helpful, as this game is going to be highly physics-based and it needs to feel realistic to players so they aren't blindsided by unpredictable behavior.",

This is not true. If the velocity is positive it means its moving away and that its red shift. If the velocity is negative then it is moving towards and is blue shift. In the example it says the answer is positive and the light is being blue-shifted. Is this right? How the hell are they getting this answer?\n\nI emailed them to see if my brain was truly fried or not here is their reply...\n\n  Thanks for getting back to us.\n\nWe’ve looked into this and you’re absolutely right that Doppler shift is usually defined so that velocity is positive if the light source is moving away from the observer.  However, the AQA specification defines Doppler shift as z = -v/c, and z &gt; 0 for red-shift.  This means that velocity will be positive for a source that is moving towards the observer.  Because our books need to cover exactly what students need to know for their exams, we’ve matched the AQA specification.  If you would like to query why Doppler shift has been defined this way by AQA, please contact the exam board and we’re sure they’ll be happy to help.\n\nIf there’s anything more we can help you with, please let us know\n\nIf I'm wrong can someone please explain to me why I'm wrong and how to get a positive or negative velocity.

        "text": "So, recently I have been looking for universities and professors, mainly in Germany, which best suit my research interests, so that I can plan what to do after my masters and possibly establish contacts that can help me in my orientation. I study mathemtics and physics and am specifically interessted in the abstract structures of physic(s). From the mathematical side I am interested in grouptheory, representation theory, algebraic geometry (noncommutative and other), differential geometry and similar ones. While on the phyiscs side I of course enjoy BSM physics. That being string theory, SuSy, and quantum gravity theories in general. I would not consider myself as phenomenologically orientated. For me the interest lays withing the study of the abstract structure fo physics for the structures sake not to necessariely make any predictions (of course validation is interesting but not key for me). I have been looking at a few universities such as Würzburg, Berlin, Leipzig, Heidelberg, Hanover (Prof. Dr. Lechtenfeld). I have not looked into them in depth yet and am mostly still collecting before looking deeper. Do you know any other universities (preferably in germany or closeby) or professors which I could look into? Do you have any opinons on the unis I have already mentioned?",

However, it seems like anything that had a beginning, could not be, unless we are saying it is ever expanding \"towards\" infinity. Is my doubt reasonable or flawed?\n\nI've also heard that time was \"created\" along with space. If it didnt exist before space, then are we sure it will go on into infinity so long as space itself remains existant?\n\nOn a more philosophical tone, I was dreaming about the concept that if time were infinite, then eventually my cell would reformulate into myself (and every other human, as they would also) since time never ceased. However, i think that is clearly false since the universe is spreading and is doomed to die in expanse and planet formation will cease (but also there is no expected re-unification of matter for which a new conglomeration to occur.\n\nThought I'd come to this subreddit and learn from those who understand these matters a bit, if anyone is willing to help me understand a bit better.\n\nThanks!",
