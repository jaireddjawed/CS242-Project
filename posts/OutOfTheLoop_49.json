People would criticize the fact he shot 9 times and others would respond “yes, you shoot until you’re sure the threat is gone” and replies would disagree.\n\nI have never ever heard of the idea that you DON’T shoot to kill. I had gun safety courses in scouts and if I learned anything things it’s don’t put your finger on the trigger unless you intend to fire it, don’t point your gun in any direction you don’t intend to fire, and don’t fire at anything you don’t intend to destroy (destroy being equivalent to kill if we weren’t aiming at targets).\n\nIMO you cannot guarantee any bullet you fire will not kill the target. So you must treat every bullet you fire as lethal.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/106j979/good_guy_with_gun_stops_bad_guy_with_gun/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

I checked it out and fell into a bit of a rabbithole of people who seemed really paranoid about big dogs, but specifically pitbulls or breeds that looked like them. There's a gigantic community of people who want every pit-looking dog to be euthanized and share videos calling them \"beasts\" and things of that nature, even when they're just minding their own business.\n\nI'm really confused, is this a new thing? Why is this getting more common?",

Ethan and Hila Klein seem to be in a never ending spiral of drama and close shaves with being cancelled. Is their marriage falling apart? I don’t have time to watch all the YouTube documentaries and podcasts. All I know is, I used to watch their funny videos, stopped watching them after they shifted to exclusively podcast content, and heard they had a kid and were doing well.",

I'd like to see politically neutral answers.\n\nI keep reading about the 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 times the House votes for Speaker, and keeps failing to elect McCarthy.\n\n- How does the Speaker of the House voting system work?\n\n- Is someone running against him?\n\n- Who is “next most likely\" after McCarthy?\n\n- Why does he keep trying? Why does he keep thinking the next vote will be a win?\n\n- What don't Republicans like about him? Is he THAT bad?\n\n- Do the Democrats vote too?\n\n- If Republicans won't elect him, why won't they rally behind someone else?\n\n- I heard the the Speaker of the House doesn't actually have to be a member of Congress. How does that work? Has that ever happened? Could it ever happen?\n\nI keep reading that he lost, but I can't find a good source to explain HOW and WHY.\n\n—————\n\n**Update:**  It look like he’ll win now.  What the heck?\n\nPolitically unbiased answers appreciated.\n\n————-\n\nLinks/Sources to News:\n\n- [CNN Link to Story](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/house-speaker-leadership-vote-01-06-23/index.html)\n\n- [Fox News Link to Story](https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/house-speaker-vote)\n\n- [CBS News Link to Story](https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/house-speaker-race-vote-kevin-mccarthy-watch-live-stream-today-2023-01-06/)\n\n——-\n\nEdits: Formatting",
