Most things are quieter, and if I was having my normal anxiety, I’d probably be totally freaking out. \n\nBut, I know if I were up and doing something, I think I would feel better. I just get so worked up and my arms and legs feel like jello because I’ve been so tensed up. \n\nIs this normal? I read that anxiety is normal during the first few weeks of taking it. I’m assuming sitting still doesn’t help? Can anyone tell me if this is normal and what else I should expect within the first few weeks of taking it? Also, when should I take it? Before or after a meal? When I have stuff I need to do? \n\nThanks.",

I digress. Since discovering ChatGPT I’ve found that I have been able to publish my blog posts that have been almost done for years. After finishing one project I felt good and started 5 more. I’m further in these projects right now than I could’ve imagined being, even at the height of my productivity.\n\nHere are the pros and cons that I’ve found using ChatGPT as someone who struggles to finish projects.\n\n__Pros__\n\n1. Memory: ChatGPT logs your conversation for access later. As a rapid task switcher this is great. I can jump right back into where I was at in a task and scroll up if I need a refresher \n\n2. Depth of technical detail: if you ask the right detailed questions, ChatGPT can help you create working code in just about any software. It _can_ help you install the right software, figure out the best lines of code to use, and create an app, with painstakingly small steps. On more than one occasion, I have thought of apps I want to create, but I get lost in the sauce when I try to make them.\n\n__Cons__\n\n1. Distraction: it’s possible to go off on unproductive tangents.\n\n2. Dependence: I find it even __more__ mundane to do trivial tasks like making event invitations, or formatting a cover letter without ChatGPT. If the free version goes away, I will certainly be paying for Plus.",

Supposed to be dying from CKD stage 3b, but doc now says that’s not the case. I started to do a few healthy things and brought my BS’s under control, lost some weight which made doc actually take me off type 2 insulin that I’d been using for 25 years 2 to 4 times a day every day. \n\nNow, given all that I’ve had time for some hard introspection. I was never diagnosed until my adult years with ADHD and dyslexia which made for a very difficult and unstable life. Blatant symptoms first appeared in 2nd grade long before anyone knew they existed. Teachers thought I was stupid and wanted to put me in “special classes”. Mom knew better and successfully fought against it. I picked up a few more letters along the way like body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and social anxiety disorder (SOC). This introspection made me realize I’ve fucked up literally every opportunity ever handed to me in my entire life. Education, dating, marriage employment, money management, health and every interpersonal relationship from family to friends I’ve fucked up. And of course, I’m the family’s black sheep. I've done stuff I should have gone to jail for (SOL long since past).\n\nSo, now I’m old and alone licking my wounds and whining to y’all. Can’t remember the last time I got laid or been with a woman. Last real relationship dissolved badly a lifetime ago. I am so very lonely. Preparing for the inevitable, I’ve left instructions to be burned and flushed once I’ve passed. I’ve managed to keep myself alive, but still trying to figure out why. If I hadn’t inherited this house with no mortgage I’d be homeless. I live here alone in an empty 4 bedroom house. I only pay taxes which allows me to remain in this decent house in this great neighborhood packed with kids. Something I was never blessed with.\n\nI’ve personally saved four lives, witnessed “the dance of the Loons”,  seen sunsets in the mountains powerful enough to make me weep and helplessly watched a parent pass away at home in front of me begging me to help her.\n\nI do not present as an angry old man but quite the opposite. I have never been nor ever will be PC. I asked my only friend why they hung around and was told this story of him observing me helping some indigent person. Later my friend asked why I did that? He says I answered “because I could”. So I guess I’m not a bad person, just one that’s growing up much too late thus only now discovering all the things in life I’ve never had. Simple things like the touch of a loving woman or being passionate about something important. Of making a difference.\n\nTL;DR Lonely old guy lives an extraordinary life filled with regret.",

I dont know at all iff this adhd connected btw. \n\nOn the off chance that anything like this is connected to 'people pleasing' (not a term am comfortable with meself), and then occasionally going to far the other way and upsetting someone with not good words, iff that makes sense.",

Sometimes I sleep when I get home, then I wake up at midnight, stay scrolling on social media for hours, then I CANT wake up early. I put the alarm, but I can’t wake up doesn’t matter how many times I set the alarm. Then I wake up tired, go straight to work (12PM), get home exhausted and all over again…\n\nEven when I don’t sleep when I get home, I still will stay awake until super late, scrolling on my phone. I just can’t stop. I should just stop but I can’t. So still I can’t wake up early, wake up late and still exhausted…\n\nPeople, and even I at this point, think I’m lazy. My mom wakes up everyday 6AM to work no matter what. But I’m stuck. What pisses me even more is that at school times I didn’t have this problem, I would just wake up, but maybe again that is because I had extern support.",

This is not an ad, and hopefully isn't against the sub's rules... I genuinely just had to go check the brush's brand.  the brand is \"quip\" ([https://www.getquip.com/store/products/electric-toothbrush-set-copper](https://www.getquip.com/store/products/electric-toothbrush-set-copper)).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a bit more expensive than I realized, but I'll definitely buy it again.  Brushing with it is very pleasant, and it feels like I'm massaging my teeth - I definitely spend more time and very regularly brush with it.  It cuts off for a second every thirtyish seconds to give you a sense of time, and so that you can ideally brush all four \"quadrants\" of your mouth for thirty seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this helps, and I'm sure it won't work for everybody - but it has changed my brushing habits immensely.",

        "text": "**TL;DR: To medicate a 6 yr old or not.  I appreciate your helpful wisdom.**\n\nAttention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects millions of children worldwide. Children with ADHD have difficulty focusing, staying organized, and controlling their behavior. If left untreated, ADHD can lead to poor academic and social outcomes, which can persist into adulthood. Therefore, medication can be a highly effective treatment option for children with ADHD.\n\nFirstly, medication has been shown to significantly reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children. Studies have found that medications such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and dextroamphetamine (Adderall) can improve attention, reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity, and increase academic performance. By improving these core symptoms of ADHD, medication can help children with ADHD better manage their daily activities and improve their overall quality of life.\n\nSecondly, medication for ADHD has been found to be safe and effective for children as young as six years old. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry both endorse the use of medication for children with ADHD, as long as it is prescribed and monitored by a qualified healthcare professional. These medications have been used for many years and have a well-established safety profile.\n\nFinally, medication for ADHD can also benefit the child's family and peers. ADHD can be very challenging for families, as children with ADHD may struggle with completing tasks, following routines, and getting along with others. By improving a child's ADHD symptoms, medication can reduce stress on the child's family and improve relationships with peers, leading to a more positive family and social environment for the child.\n\nIn conclusion, medication can be a highly effective and safe treatment option for children with ADHD, and can improve not only the child's symptoms but also their academic and social outcomes. If a six-year-old child has been diagnosed with ADHD, medication may be a reasonable option to consider, especially if the child's symptoms are significantly affecting their daily functioning. However, any decision regarding medication should be made in consultation with a qualified healthcare professional who can evaluate the child's individual needs and monitor the medication's effectiveness and safety.",

        "text": "Friendly disclaimer! I'm not looking for medical advice! :P so please don't respond to this saying. \"Talk to your psychiatrist\".  Obviously who else am I going to talk to. 😀\n\nAlright. Now that I got that little part out of the way.\n\nI am currently prescribed and taking Adderall XR 15MG (Sandoz) once daily. I went up from 5mg then to 10mg to 15mg.\n\nFelt absolutely nothing on 5mg so moved to 10mg felt something on 10mg slightly anxious though. But wasn't giving me the needed benefits so jumped up to 15mg.\n\nNow that I'm on 15mg it feels like I can focus a bit better than on 10mg. Paradoxically on 15mg I feel less anxious than I did on the 10mg. But I will certainly say that it feels kinda speedy ish. I also feel slightly anxious during the comeup period shortly after taking my daily dose. Nothing debilitating though. This dose has felt more effective in treating my ADHD. \n\nI am wondering as it feels \"speedy\",/ \"jittery\" (speedys a better word for it). Should I keep titrating the dose of my Adderall or should I start to consider trying a different medication?. I know the L-amp in Adderall can feel a little speedy. Hence my increase in heart rate, assuming blood pressure, general speedyness. (Im not saying I'm tweaking by no means) if you know you know I guess.\n\nI am 15 years old and I've been on Ritalin when I was 7 it made me more hyper. Switched to Vyvanse and it made me depressed. So I stopped the process of effort in getting medicated for ADHD.\n\nFast-forward a few years later I'm trying again. I was originally prescribed Straterra this year and it made me insanely angry and nauseous and had horrible vertigo. Now I'm on Adderall after that and it's going good besides a few negatives.\n\nTL:DR: I'm wondering if I should keep trying with Adderall or switch medications. Though I don't know because I've been through some common meds and Adderall so far has been most effective.\n\nLooking for some input on your similar situations!\n\nThanks!!",

Unfortunately the day I’ve been dreading has arrived, as today I went and saw a new primary care for my medications. I explained the situation, why I’m seeking a new prescriber, how long I’ve been on the medication, etc. I felt like I was being interrogated. I have a not so great memory, so when she asks what I tried before Adderall/Klonopin and why we settled on the medication, I don’t know what to say!! I’ve been on the medicine for 8-10 years, I was a child I don’t know why I didn’t mesh well with alternative options! She suggested SSRIs as a replacement for the medications. She referred me to a psychiatrist for the prescriptions and diagnosis (as if I haven’t ADHD, PTSD, anxiety, &amp; depression for 10 years…). \nAs I’m DRIVING out of the parking lot, she ran out and waved me down to ask why my story didn’t line up. What? What story? Some of my medicines haven’t been filled for months. I explained that there’s been a prevalent Adderall shortage (which is true, the pharmacy has my prescription but there’s no medicine to fill it), and my primary care hasn’t been prescribing the Klonopin because she doesn’t feel “safe” giving it to me anymore. Actually, their hospital is avoiding Benzo prescriptions altogether despite the severity of your condition (which is fucked up because I was previously on Xanax and Ativan which worked 900x better but ya know…). \nI know I’m ranting about an issue most people have had. I just feel so awful. I’m trying so hard to get the medicine I’ve been on for 10 years. I swear I’m not an addict, or someone abusing my medication. I’m just trying so hard to function. I’m in weekly therapy, I’ve tried a lot of alternatives. I’m not a bad person, I’m just a person trying to live as if each day isn’t a really difficult insurmountable task. My life has been so hard recently without medication and I feel like a criminal for asking for it. I’m probably not explaining the situation well, I’m in a state of anger and anxiety right now. I am so hurt and feel hopeless. I feel like the rest of my life is ruined. I feel like the healthcare system has set an insane amount of people up for failure. I’m devastated.",

I am willing to drive 30 minutes out of my way if needed. I'm okay with telehealth, I just need the provider to be local.\n\nI'm honestly at my wits end. I've been struggling for months trying to just find somebody. All the providers my therapist recommended are booked or not accepting new patients. I'm running out of options. I feel like my ADHD is getting worse and I'm getting more and more stressed out. My marriage is falling apart. I'm honestly just considering admitting myself to the local psych ward. I can't keep living like this. ADHD is a curse and if I could, I would be anyone else. This is a horrific disorder to have.\n\nTL;DR I live in Buffalo, NY and need LOCAL psychiatric provider recommendations so I can receive medication and an official ADHD diagnosis.",

        "text": "It all started about a year ago. My sister got prescribed Vyvanse to help with her ADHD and was complaining about side effects, how this drug doesn’t help her and yada yada... Me being the asshole that I am, I decided to take it upon myself to prove that she is just being a crybaby.\nI since learned that the side effects are in fact real, but worse, I learned that the drug actually works (who could have thought?).\nWhen I took it, I felt a boost of hope and motivation, became hyper productive, ambitious, positive like never before, and started enjoying what I was doing—for about 14 hours after which I lost my superpowers and returned to being a plain old muggle. \nI since started taking her Vyvanse whenever I have an exam or a project and it just makes me so much more … better. I wouldn’t say that I am at the point where I take it recreationally, but I am definitely relying on it in some parts of my routine.\nI am worried that this drug is becoming a major source of my productivity diminishing other activities that used to source my productivity and will hurt me in the long run.\nI don’t know if I should seek some sort of help quitting Vyvanse or actually get a diagnosis and potentially a prescription for myself. I am worried that if I don’t get diagnosed with ADHD I will lose my excuse to grab her Vyvanse. Is there a way to become the Vyvanse-me without the Vyvanse?\n\nFor context, I am currently in college, I was never diagnosed with ADHD though I do show some minor symptoms (doesn’t mean that I actually have ADHD). I am considering getting a diagnosis tho I do suspect that I won’t be diagnosed (unless I purposefully exaggerate my condition).",

I appreciate all responses, even from those that have not used drugs or do not have a diagnosis of ADHD. \n\nAll responses are anonymous and cannot be traced back to you. This is all outlined in the information sheet.  I believe this research may help to change the way that young people (especially those with ADHD) can be safeguarded against drugs by furthering the understanding of a lack of diagnosis may impact behaviour. \n\n\n\n[link to study](https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1BrvcAhPqgU1yOq)",

        "text": "So i am the eldest in our family, and our youngest has been diagnosed with ADHD for the past 7 years already. He is 15 and weighs about 90kg. Our family caught his weird behavior very late and because of this we havent heavily disciplined him. Everytime he ask something about something impossible and we respond with a \"no\" or its not possible he gets very angry easily and will try to harm us in any way possible such as throwing anything than can be thrown. There was this one time also that he got very angry because of something so small that my mother forgot to gave him sleeping meds because he couldnt sleep well but actually as we see it he was snoring and was sleeping very well, he was so angry that he choked my mother with his hands and even thrown a glass bottle of ketchup and my mother was hit in the head and she was injured. Luckily it wasnt that critical. But still was very dangerous if repeated.\n\nThis has happened a lot of times in the past years. Just recently this was occuring almost everyday, just the smallest thing can irritate him and become angry to the point that he doesn't even know what he is doing if its bad or good, he just want to harm as. As of now we cannot enter the house since he is blocking all entrances and if we go closer to him he will just smack as with a bat. \n\nHe is prescribed Respiridon half in the morning and half in the evening but even with the medicine he is still very aggressive and violent. We can no longer control him, he just do what he always wants. \n\nHe has a past of sometimes occuring seizures but for the past 2 years there hasnt been any seizures occuring unlike the other years where he seizures once every 2 months and because of this he takes 2 meds Respiridon which was prescribe from the doctor and the other for his seizures and sometimes sleeping meds when he feels like he cant sleep. And i do think that all this meds affected his weight, and because of this its very hard to calm him down when he is on his rage mode as to we cannot physically control or calm him down because he is too big.\n\nSo back to what i said about his behavior is getting worse, for the past week his aggression and violent actions has becoming non stop. My aunts and uncles who helped us everytime he rages and starts hurting anyone around has also had enoughed and my family also had enough. My mother is also a single mother since my father died very early.\n\nMy brother was also enrolled in a very special school that specializes in special kids, he was also in therapy for atleast 5 years until the center shut down due to the lack of funds.\n\nCurrently me and my family and I discussed and agreed to put him in a social rehabilitation center to help him and us because it is heavily affecting our family situation in all corners. Of course in order to do this we need a doctors order which the doctor said its an option if we want to. It is really hard for the past few weeks, i couldnt focus on school and my mother had to take a lot of work leaves.\n\nI am 18 yrs old and im the eldest, sorry for my bad english. I dont know what to do anymore it pains me to see my mother crying and it pains me more thinking about the future. So can you please help me if we made the right decision?",
