A little back story before I get to my main question.\n\nGrowing up I was a smart kid, grew up in the country, spend every night staring up into the stars. We had minimal light pollution so it was amazing. Was always at the top of my class until we moved and I made new friends. It was 8th grade when my grades began to slip, I stopped caring and only wanted to cause trouble with my new friends. We go into drugs and I lost interest at the time in the sky. I jumped around and went to different high schools, nothing seemed to get me on track so I took my GED and went on with life. I was still pretty bright just seemed uneducated. Had excellent problem solving skills but lacked a fundamental base. Now that I was not going to school I had to find a job. I started into the IT field as computers came second nature. What a boring field. I didn't enjoy it but continued on as I needed a steady paycheck to pay for my life. About 10 years ago I attended a new years eve party and partook in some Ecstasy. The night began fine but as it progressed I was fed and partook in more and more. By the end of the evening I had taken 8 tabs. Way to much. I made it home and suffered through the hangover. Instantly I could tell my photographic memory was gone. I could tell I seemed slower. Broken. I was still pretty sharp but not like before. Something changed. Now that I felt broken, lost confidence and slugged through a tech support job that a monkey could perform I got depressed. Basically my life up until a couple years ago. I visited the Houston Museum of Natural Science and attended a show in the planetarium. Reignited my desire. Living in the big city for so long you lose sight of the stars. I had almost forgotten what it was like to see them again. Consumed by a desire to learn brings me to here and now. My brain has been improving as the years go by. It is no where near what it was but it is an improvement.\n\n I would like to go back to school. I plan on taking some brush up high school algebra classes and bring myself back up to the community college level. I plan to work on getting my associates in physical science and proceed into my BS and beyond in astrophysics. My question to you all. With so much school looming in front of my, a poor high school record and age never slowing down will I still be taken seriously? I know there is lots of school that I need to take. I understand the math I will need to learn and relearn. \n\n In your professional and or amateur opinions do I still have a chance in this field? I am optimistic that I could succeed if I put forth the effort and show that I am not the immature teen age kid who ruined his future with sex, drugs, and rock and roll! \n\nWould you give a middle aged man who just  graduated a chance? It would all be moot if I spend all this money on college only to get passed up for the younger individual.\n\nI apologize for the wall of text. ",

I also have a M.S. in Computer Graphics.  So, I'm no stranger to math... I took four calculus classes as an undergrad, and graphics/game development is all about the linear algebra.  I also took two and a half years of physics in high school and another two courses in college.  I was even planning on minoring/majoring in physics, but my school's one and only physics professor was less than fantastic.\n\nI've been doing professional video game development as a software engineer for seven years now, and even though I love it, it's not as fresh and challenging as it was seven years ago.  About a year ago, I began toying with going back to school to get a master's in astrophysics.  I love physics, I can cope with math, and astronomy has been a life long fascination.  Oh, and my programming skills might come in handy too.\n\nThe range of careers for astrophysics seem quite narrow, to say the least.  So, I don't really foresee myself leaving my career as a game developer for a career in astrophysics, but, I would still like to study it for the challenge, to satisfy my curiosity, and to, generally speaking, be a better rounded individual.\n\nWith that said, spending $25,000-$50,000 on a master's degree seemed a bit superfluous.  Then, one day not too long ago, I realized, \"hey, I teach game development to others (I'm a part-time professor), why can't I just teach myself astrophysics?\"  With that thought lodged securely in my brain, learning astrophysics on a budget of $200 per textbook instead of $2500 per class suddenly seemed much more reasonable.\n\nThe question now, and the one I pose to you, is, \"where do I start?\"\n\nMy physics and math are a bit rusty, and a refresher wouldn't hurt, but probably isn't incredibly necessary. \n\nI recently watched the entire series of Khan Academy videos on astrophysics and greatly enjoyed them.  Now, I'm looking for something a bit heavier, and in book/textbook form.\n\nI bought \"Astrophysics is Easy!\" by Mark Inglis on my Kindle but had to return it b/c all of the diagrams were missing, which, is too bad b/c it seemed like it would have been a good intermediary book.  Now, I'm looking at \"Astrophysics in a Nutshell\" by Dan Maoz, but, I'm worried it may be a bit too technical.\n\nSo, any suggestions?  And, for good measure, here's a twist... I'm physical disabled and have a hard time handling physical books, so, books that I can get digitally are much preferred.",

However, while writing it, it occurred to me that I can't just have Jupiter disappear... surely there have to be some gravitational perturbation effects caused by the explosion as well?\nI was wondering if anyone with any expertise could give me a general picture as to what would happen if Jupiter were to disappear tomorrow. I have the following ideas in mind, and any appendages to them, or corrections (or new ideas altogether) would be greatly appreciated!\n\na) Jupiter's gravity pulls the inner planets a bit outward away from the sun. In the absence of Jupiter, the inner planets would 'sink in' towards the sun, causing Mercury to crash into the sun, Venus to get closer, Earth to get closer (and get hotter, causing most life to go extinct), and Mars to get closer. \n\nb) The outer planets would probably experience orbital disturbances.\n\nc) Jupiter's inner satellites would probably be destroyed in the same explosion, whereas the outer ones would go flying off, careening either into the other gas giants and their satellites, or the asteroid belt\n\nd) The asteroid belt itself would coalesce into a planet, in the absence of Jupiter's tidal forces ripping it apart.\n\ne) Conversely,  entropy might prevent the asteroid belt to coalesce; the only disturbances the asteroid belt would experience would be from the incoming satellites (or fragments of satellites) that once belonged to Jupiter.\n\nPlease forward your ideas, if you have any! All help would be greatly appreciated! :) \nCheers",

I'm very thrilled to be in this program and love film with all my heart. Unfortunately the program itself does not properly start until next year, so this year I am filling my schedule with classes that interest me for 12 credits. One of them is an introductory Astronomy course. I have always had an interest in the cosmos, but never pursued it. This class, however, has thrilled me more than I thought possible.\n\nIn taking it, I've spent a lot of time reading and watching lectures (I particularly love listening to Neil deGrasse Tyson, but that's not at all surprising) and just learning all that I can about it. I'm loving it tremendously, and was saddened to learn recently that following this Astronomy class, I have reached the end of astrophysics options for non-majors. While I do not want to switch my major, I similarly do not wish to simply accept that this is the end of my astrophysics growth.\n\nSo now I turn to the internet, and specifically to you, reddit. I am looking to find ways to continue pursuing astrophysical learning in my own time, at my own pace. I am no stranger to basic physics, but when it comes to more advanced topics (relativity, for instance; my physics knowledge is limited to Newtonian) I am woefully ignorant. What sources should I turn to? I've considered purchasing the Feynman Lectures on Physics and working my way through them gradually, and am currently reading a few astrophysics specific books - Carl Sagan's Cosmos is sitting on my desk and I recently ordered one of NdGT's books on the origin of the universe.\n\nI've also considered investing in a telescope. I assume a decent reflector telescope is what I should be looking for, but otherwise I am clueless as far as what I should look into. I've been reading r/Astronomy for more info here, but if any of you have advice I'd appreciate it.\n\nFurther, while there are no astrophysics-specific courses available, I will have the option of taking General Physics 1 and Calculus 1. While I already have credit for the latter after having taken AP Calculus in high school, I think that taking a general Physics class could help on some level. Is this an accurate assumption, or am I way off?\n\n**TL;DR: How should I, in my own time, pursue and cultivate an interest in astrophysics? What books should I read, what magazines should I look into, and should I invest in a telescope?**\n\n**EDIT:** I'd like to add that, although the class is labeled as an astronomy class, the professor is a particle physicist who has thus far treated it from a very astrophysical standpoint. No constellations or astrology garbage. So far we've really only covered things like spectroscopy and gravitation, but it's definitely a more physics-oriented course than the name implies.",

A time to reflect and think about all that has happened around me and to piece thoughts together from different experiences.\n\nToday’s thought was about fire, well, not so much fire but heat. But it came from a picture of fire. I started to think about how maybe there is no such thing as gravity. All the pictures of lensing are usually done by a star, heat. The heat bends space around the star thus creating the lens. Usually when something is large (mass) then it can lens stuff as well. But usually the bigger the object is the hotter it is.\n\nThe second piece of the puzzle came the other day when they talked about phase changing from the big bang. Where everything was hot and as it cooled the structure of the universe started to come together. So, from that prospective, heating and cooling played another part in the construction of the universe. \n\nThen I started to think a little of relativity and how those grid lines around objects. Usually, the hotter the object the more it warped space around it. I always, have had a hard time imaging how a super nova could cause a black hole. How could something ejecting so much matter then collapse on its self to form a black hole – heat. The heat that is ejected warps space and makes space collapse back on itself.\n\nGoing off in a crazy direction, I have always thought it was weird to hear something was hot / cold when they mean good or bad. Where did this get imprinted onto our molecules? Heat = good, cool = bad?  Usually the \"hotter\" something (someone) is the more we are pulled towards it. \n\nTL;DR - I usually think of things from my surroundings and I’m sorry if I wasted your time for my thought. I think heat maybe what we describe gravity.\n",

They start spread out, but then over time become clumped together.\n\nThen I began thinking of the milk as the fabric of spacetime. Imagine we are a Cheerio floating atop the milk. All we will ever be able to see and experience is floating on top of the milk with us. But if you add more and more mass to the Cheerio, it won't float anymore and will merge past the \"membrane\" of the surface of the milk to under the surface of the milk (it will sink). Then that got me thinking about black holes. I was thinking how a black hole could be similar to the massive Cheerio sinking past the membrane of the surface of the milk, perhaps leading to another dimension or something (the abyss of milk below the surface).\nIn other words, a black hole could break the surface tension of spacetime (surface of milk where all matter [or cereal] floats) and lead to something similar like floating aimlessly in an abyss of milk (another dimension or something).\nDo any of you have any thoughts on this? I just found it interesting to think about.",

        "text": "Formation of the moon has been puzzling scientists for decades. the leading theory that a mars sized body struck earth at exactly the right angle to fragment pieces that formed the moon while the original impacting body did NOT mix with earth has been harmed by new evidence from moon rocks showing the moon is EXACTLY the same composition as earth (unlikely if a mars sized body hit earth and mixed ANY dirt.)\n\nAn interesting alternative theory is proposed by this guy who says that the earth was spinning faster only 65 million yrs ago while dinosaurs were alive and earth was still cooling and therefore shrinking and increasing density and thus rotation speed and more dense stuff sank increasing spin rate and less dense stuff rose to the equator formed a bulge held only by it's \"stickiness\". Then when earth spin rate had increased to about  7hrs a day it simply peeled off forming the moon.\n\nNow you can debate it and read all about the evolutionary biology and age of the seafloor(65 million years) supporting this theory if you want (but NOT HERE here because this post is about testing the physics NOT his dinosaur extinction theory) but testing the physics would be good first.\n\nWe want to know if planets can indeed sling off moons as they spin up from cooling shrinkage and redistribution of the masses in their interiors.\n\nHow to test:\nYour task -should you accept it- is to model varying density particles in proportions equal to combined earth moon elements in a primitive rotating body the size of earth plus moon and see if the less dense particles bulge to equator and then if they spin off and reform a moon with orbit around earth changing orbit and rotation speeds to the current earth moon parameters.\n\nYou should model some adhesion between particles (important for the peeling away and relative non destructive retention of surface as the moon with a varying density of heavier side toward earth.)\n\nyou must model gravity of the system DYNAMICALLY as individual gravity particles of varying density attracted together first as one then two bodies not two bodies with generalized gravity (that won't work).\n\nYou must model conservation of angular momentum of those same individual particles as the heavier ones sink to the center of the earth and the lighter ones head toward the equator which will change the speed of rotation of the earth system.\n\nYou also have to model shrinking of all the particles as they cool because this on one of the primary forces causing earth to spin more rapidly as it cools. and earth was still cooling and therefore increased density per radius \n\nTo test if the theory is correct you should start with a earth/moon combo mass spinning faster in about 7 hrs for the length of a day bulging then slinging off pieces that reach net zero g at equator (gravity minus centripetal acceleration at equator results in net zero g at equator) and ending up with a moon and earth and an earth which slows down after slinging off the pieces that become the moon (and carrying away some angular momentum)\n\nObviously the moon pieces will at first be non round but if you model the particles individually they should coalesce to form a round moon with heavier particles near earth side just as real moon has (because earth's gravity causes the heavy side of the moon to be pulled and stabilized toward earth..\n\nfrom Marshall Smith's original theory backed up on another page since the url is now defunt and the url squatter robots.txt precludes web archiving (annoying!) http://loveforlife.com.au/content/08/08/25/what-really-killed-dinosaurs-marshall-douglas-smith\n\n\"If the earth spins at 24 hours per day, as it does today, then the force of gravity at the equator is about the same as the force of gravity at the north and south poles. If the earth spins faster, in about a 12 hour revolution day, then the force of gravity at the equator is around half of what it would be at the poles. And if the earth spins around in about 7 hours, then the force of gravity becomes rather close to zero at the equator, while the force at the poles remains the same. \" Also: \"A little further calculation can show that almost all of the moons in our solar system were ejected from their parent planet by this very same process. It is a natural part of the aging and evolution of planetary systems. As a rotating planet cools, it spins faster and faster, becoming oblate and unstable. It releases a moon from the oblate surface, just like Tara Lipinski ( an ice skater ) putting out her arms to slow down her spin, decreasing the planet's rotation rate and it becomes stable again. This may be repeated with the larger planets. After a long time, the larger planets continue to cool and shrink and release another moon. The larger the planet the more moons it produces to become stable.\"\n\n\ncurrent nvidia cuda programming should allow immense numbers of particles to be modeled on your desktop if you have a decent modern nvidia graphics card.\n\neven without cuda programming a decent multibody simulation might allow enough particles of varying density for a reasonable simulation.\n\nSome of you MUST be doing multibody simulations now and could probably simply plug in 5,000 particles of varying density rotating in a mass about the size of earth/moon proto mass at around 7 hrs per day and see what happens.\n\nhow about running it and uploading the graphical animation?",

I just graduated from high school and am going to community college this coming semester. \nAny tips/thoughts for some one who isn't gifted in math but really wants to study in school? Or should I just keep it a hobby because it's not worth it?",

        "text": "Undergrad astronomy student here. I know that Hubble's constant H_0 is approximately 73 km/s/Mpc. I know that h is a parameter related to H_0, and I have seen someone on another site state that h=H_0/100. The problem I am encountering is expressing h^-1 * Mpc as a unit of distance. I have seen this several places, but it seems like the units don't work out. If h has the same units as H_0 (1/second) then h^-1 * Mpc would have units of distance*time rather than distance.  My first instinct is converting H_0 to h involves a cancellation to make it unitless, but I would love any help people can offer.",
