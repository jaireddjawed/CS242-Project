Is there the possibility that on other planets there are civilizations rising and falling in the span of a short time on earth but a long time in that area of space? (Theoretically if there were other civs out there) if black holes hold galaxies together, would the systems closer to the black hole experience time faster and planets go hundreds of years through time as we sit on earth? Could that be a reason we havent found life? In what seems a day on earth a planet closer to the center of the galaxy (presumably spinning around the galaxy at a faster rate) may have had life at what seems a short period of time on earth (maybe a time in which we were unable to observe this planet with its shirt time window to observe) but felt normal to the beings on the planet?
