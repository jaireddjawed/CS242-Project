        "text": "For [best health and nutrition](http://www.smschospital.com/centre-for-digestive-and-liver-diseases.php), it is important to eat a variety of foods from the five food groups, which include:\n\n1. Fruits and vegetables.\n\n2. Grains.\n\n3. Dairy.\n\n4. Protein foods, and\n\n5. Oils.\n\nThere is a lot of nutrition information available to help people choose foods that provide the needed nutrition for a healthy lifestyle. Most nutritionists agree that good nutrition can be affordable if you know how and where to shop, and how to prepare foods in a way that keeps them nutritious.\n\nFirst, several laboratories have developed accurate and specific tests that can be performed on various samples of the food. Many of the tests are done at one time and the information is grouped into the format used on labels. That means, they not only calculate the vitamin content but the percent of the USDA per serving or per 100 grams.\n\nSuch tests are not inexpensive, so companies may do this analysis whenever they have made a recipe change or are ready to re-print the labels.\n\nThe second approach is to use standard food analysis tables. Reputable tables have used an average of multiple samples to obtain a value for any single nutrient. This is critical, given differences in soil nutrients, transportation losses, and losses from handling the food.\n\nThis method is far less expensive and may be used when a new product is introduced in a limited area (test market) or for a limited time.\n\nThe nutritional value of food is a concept used to describe the number of nutrients found in the foods in your diet. There are several different factors that have a direct impact on the nutritional value of our food. These factors include the type of food, the way it is prepared, the brand you purchase, and the serving size.",

So is it a good taste enhancer and what should be my limit. Any literature on this will be great help!",
