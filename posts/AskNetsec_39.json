See device and port names for your S-Series model: S200, S400, S500.\" should I only change the port names in the first lines (SETUP) or go in every single class etc and search for port names? Are there any? The problem is that having seen the back up configuration of one of the packetshapers we will upgrade, the amount of lines are way too many and I'm afraid replacing \"inside\" with \"slot2_in\" randomly in the whole backup text, as it might ruin something!\n\nAnother question is, in the backup file I have been given, I do not see any IP configuration or anything like it says here: \"If the S-Series will use different IP addresses than the legacy appliance, modify the appliance IP address, gateway settings, and/or DNS server.\", I mean, modify it where in the backup? There is no IP or any network settings in the SETUP section or anywhere I can see.\n\nIf anyone has done this before, help will be appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance guys!",

Yesterday I checked stats and saw that a website called [reedpen.us](http://reedpen.us) was being accessed by all the devices on my wi-fi (a PC, iPad and iPhone). The website shows a string of text varying in length, when I reload the page. I had never before visited that website. \n\nI asked on /r/pihole and they said it was highly suspicious. I blocked the domain and contacted its owner (who own 800+ domains with similar, vague names) by e-mail. I don't expect him to be real or answer it. The next day another unkown domain, called [clothingsets.us](http://clothingsets.us), reached the top list of visited domains. It contains the same as the previous website.\n\nI also blocked that domain and its IP address and I tried to follow the advice I got from /r/pihole - installing a network traffic analyzer to find out more. I downloaded Wireshark and did not get any closer to an answer. The iPad and PC ping try to ping the domain with every few minutes day and night. The iPhone doesn't do it as often. \n\nI am very inexperienced with networks and know only the basic terms. I find this to be quite unsetteling and would greatly appreciate any help. Thank you!\n\n**EDIT:** I am pretty sure this is just my VPN on my iPad. The different domains are different virtual locations. I was just stupid and forgot, that I visited the domains manually with my PC and phone... I contacted my VPN provider and asked, if this is right. I will edit here, if it is not them.",

I assume openssl instead does not have a fallback and so fails.\n\nI have been trying to find out if there's anything anywhere that defines the \"correct\" behavior here. Does anybody have any pointers? RFC-4158 seems to imply in 3.5.12 that a mismatch in AKID/SKID is not grounds for eliminating certificates, RFC-3280 does discuss the extension not being mandatory, but I am wondering given the difference in behavior between golang and openssl.\n",

I was managing a team of people who perform the security testing of applications, network and various type of hosts. I recently quit the job and currently in the process of setting up shop on my own and perform some security certifications to boost the credibility and to appeal to the business. Though I cannot compete with the bigger players, there are some small jobs which I am currently doing to support myself and sustain the days. I was preparing the costing for Penetration testing and VA of networked devices and have got some idea about the various charges. The planned cost starts around 5000 USD and go up depending upon the number of hosts and the network setup. I have also teaming up with friends in the info sec community to help me in the assignments and eventually to be part of the team. Now, I have received a proposal to evaluate a network monitoring product to see how it fits and fares against the competition in terms of security, scalability, performance and features. I am currently facing the wall since I could not arrive at a costing model / hourly rates etc., and now have turned my hands towards the community. Could you please help me in guiding to arrive at a costing model for the same? Basically, the model which I've envisioned is a full fledged technical evaluation testing of the product. Thanks for all your help.",

I phoned my ISP and we did a factory reset and we still were unable to login so he said our internet may be compromised and we should get a new router with a different brand (cisco to hitron) and things would be okay. \n\nSince swapping the routers I've been able to login to the account however I've still been noticing weird instances on my computer. \nThey've been subtle but worrying. \nThings like my internet disconnecting at very convenient times, once I reload the page its suddenly fine. \nYoutube videos appearing watched. \nMy bluetooth being turned on after I go to sleep during the night. \nMy wifi being changed from my slower one to the faster one without me doing so. \nWhen I click the wifi button at the top of the screen suddenly it will disconnect, then reconnect very quickly. \nSometimes my computer will suddenly ramp up and the fans will kick on when i'm doing activities but other times it won't when i'm doing the exact same thing. Like watching youtube. \n\nedit: i just noticed a PC on my icloud that i never allowed either\n\nI'm not sure where to go from here. Any advice would be appreciated.  ",

I feel like I am focusing too much on developer skills and I don't know what would be right.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1.a. How important are the developer skills in this industry?\n\n1.b. If they are important at all what would be the right type programming language to master?\n\n2.a. Does the experience as a web-developer (full-stack for example) help you better understand the context of web security?\n\n2.c. If it is, would you recommend starting as a web-developer for some time before venturing in the cyber-sec field?\n\n3 How important are studies in this field (is it worth pursuing a masters degree)?\n\n4 How important are certifications in this field?\n\n5 How hard is it to get a job without any prior experience (after graduating)?\n\n6 What are the 3 skills that are valued the most in this field (personal qualities and professional skills)?\n\n\nNow moving a bit off topic:\n\n7. With minimum explanation (I don't want to start a war), what do you think would be more useful thing to learn, ASP.NET Core or Node.js for back-end development? Just to mention I'm not looking for easy, I'm looking for something that could lead me to a job or part-time freelancing and they are both appealing. I am decent with C++ so the transition to C# won't hurt; oooor should I start leaning Javascript(which i don't mind)?\n\n\n\nIn the end,if you have any advise on what should I learn or any tips I would appreciate if you leave them here, like anything you find useful or you wish you have known it before starting your career.\n\nOh yea and if you have neat cybersecurity news sources, like sites or subreddits(I'm new around here), I would be more than happy to check them out.\n\n",

I'm not sure where to start once we are connected to the network and have scanned it.\n\nNote, I have set up my Kali linux. It's dist-upgraded and ready to go.\n\nThese are my basic assumptions. \nScan network with nmap, to find all available devices.\nWe have been told they are 'hidden' somehow?\nI think this means scan the network with nmap at like T4?\nBut what are the best options that I should be looking at?\n\nOnce we find all the devices. Nmap should help with OS detection etc. As well as open ports and versions.\n\nThis is where I get confused. They told us that the computers are like Windows 7 and full of holes.\n\nHow do I know what program/port to use so that I can apply metasploit exploits to it? \n\nClearly from reading this you can probably see my gaps in knowledge. \n\nIf you would kindly point out some tips and tricks, we would appreciate having a fighting chance. :)",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\nMe and my partner had a security issue we can't find an explanation to and are just curious to solve.\nBoth myself and her had our bank accounts hacked over a period of two days. \n\nWe are customers of the same bank in Canada, but we have separate accounts. We also never use the same devices (each logins only with his own PC that has antivirus installed or phone app) and we only login using our home WIFI (WPA2 encrypted, never through any public network) or mobile network (we have different providers).\n\nThe bank website is SSL of course, and the two hacks had the same pattern - e-transfers of the same amount were sent from each account and each account's email was changed (to the same address as before, but in a different domain - some disposable mail server).\nMoreover, my partner's account was hacked a day after she changed her password! \n\nDo you have any ideas where this breach could have come from?",

It sounds like this is how they've always done it and is just their typical business way of doing it, but should I worry? \n\nIs there any way to make an email 'safer' or encrypted or something?

I am interested in security recommendations for specific frameworks (secure coding) but I am especially interested in the general handling of such frameworks in development. E.g., how can a company keep up with all this ever changing/always new frameworks, are there framework Vuln. Scanners (I noticed that burp and acunetix are completely useless when developing e.g., in meteor), what frameworks to use when building applications that will be used for at least 5 years, how are you making sure that web-apps are developed securely. \n\nI am currently thinking about this topic at work and finding new resources is not that easy. \n\nThx and Cheers",
