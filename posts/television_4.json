        "text": "Hi.\n\nHope you‚Äôre all doing well.\n\nSometimes the lead character just isn‚Äôt interesting enough, or badly written, or badly acted, maybe the actor has too much control behind the scenes over the show and their character and has bad instincts (perhaps a Producer or EP), perhaps the lead has a specific role and it gets stale quickly, or maybe, the supporting cast is just so consistently awesome that it often overshadows the main character and it‚Äôs not really the fault of the main character/actor.\n\nWhatever the case, some shows have fantastic supporting casts and occasionally I don‚Äôt really care all that much for the main character.\n\nIt‚Äôs not like I dislike any of these characters, but more getting less inspired from them over time and it‚Äôs more that I prefer the supporting cast rather than actively dislike the main character.\n\nOne such show is 24.\n\nJack Bauer was incredibly interesting for a while and for about 3-4 seasons or so I was still very invested in his story, but at a certain point, especially after certain important characters left the main cast (I won‚Äôt spoil it for anyone), I just felt like his brand of torture and threatening innocent people with death in the name of national security started becoming a little stale and felt like more of a crutch. Plus, it felt like gradually they were starting to make him seem too much like a superhero who can withstand anything you throw at him and brush it off.\n\nI personally preferred the stories and dynamics of the likes of Tony Almeida, Nina Meyers, Chloe O‚ÄôBrian, Bill Buchanan, Audrey Raines and George Mason.\n\nTo a far lesser extent, I kind of had similar feelings in regards to Frasier as Niles and Daphne, Roz and Martin after a while seemed a little more interesting than Frasier Crane. He was great and all, but the growth and likability of these other characters was really great to watch over the seasons.\n\nWhat about you? Are there any shows where you prefer the supporting cast even more than the main character?",

The first time I watched the show, I really hated him, especially after he killed Lem. I couldn't believe he would do something so heinous to his own friend and then try to cover it up.\n\nHowever, upon watching it again, I still think Shane is a POS, but I can understand why he did what he did. Lem's death was a result of the Strike Team's illegal activities, and they were all at risk of getting caught. In Shane's mind, killing Lem was a way to protect himself, his team, and their families. It was a terrible decision, but I can understand the fear and desperation that drove him to it.\n\nOf course, that doesn't excuse his actions, and he still deserves to face the consequences. But I think it's interesting how a second viewing of the show can completely change your perspective on a character.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Have you ever had a similar experience where you completely changed your opinion on a character or storyline upon re-watching a show?",

Some of the chuck, jimmy, or Kim scenes were Oscar level performances. \n\nIt was way better shot. The cinematography was amazing. I couldn‚Äôt believe how many damn cool shots there were, and how you can tell what the cinematographer was trying to convey with that shot.\n\nWhat‚Äôs better about breaking bad:\n\nThe highs are more high, in my opinion. Ozymondias is still my favorite tv episode ever. (On the contrary, the lows are more low.)\n\nThe overall plot had higher stakes and I found it more interesting. The show kept feeling bigger and bigger stakes with each season. \n\nOverall, I‚Äôm sad that the breaking bad/bcs universe is over. But wow what incredible shows.",

I don't get that.\n\nWell maybe in itself, I dunno, but you can get something that's called Apple One. It costs around 10 dollars and with that I get: Apple TV+, Apple Music (which really isn't worse than Spotify), Apple Arcade (a bunch of cool mobile games), and 200 GB of iCloud. And all that except the drive you can share with up to 5 other people.\n\nIt's a fantastic deal. Granted to make the most of it you need to be in the Apple ecosystem, but is that really the problem here? Plus even if you aren't and don't want to be, you can still get it for Apple TV+ to use through the website or TV/console Apps and Apple Music app is available for Android too. \n\nMaybe people don't know about it, so here I am, maybe it will help someone.

        "text": "From the UK.\n\nStars Simon Bird, of Inbetweeners fame, playing the role of a narcissistic religious dad.\n\nThe general premise is that the entire family is in some sort of Christian cult (although, it isn't explicitly stated which cult they are part of, with parts mimicking JW, Mormon, etc.)\n\nIt's a comedy (although, it goes in more heavy on the emotional moments) with the family dealing with the conflicts of the cult, and their desire to 'lead' their lives how they want. Touches on sex, exclusions from the cult, alcohol, homosexuality, etc. Simon Bird's character trying to strike the perfect balance between caring for his family and the responsibilities to his religion.\n\nConsidering there is only 6 episodes, there is a surprising amount of character growth in the 3 hours run time.\n\nI had a quick look through Reddit before I posted this. I couldn't find any search results in /r/television (although, there likely is), but I did find a TON of results in ex-JW communities on this site. Some say that it is fantastic television, but may also be 'triggering' for those who are ex-cult members and subject to exclusion. So, if you are an ex-cult member, then perhaps watch it with somebody that isn't? That way, they can keep an eye out for you, I guess.\n\nFor the religious folk that aren't part of one of these 'cults', then there isn't anything really offensive in there. It isn't really an attack on religion. The religious rules just provide the background to the family's dynamic. So, no blasphemy or whatever here.\n\nI hadn't heard of the show until it randomly appeared on my Facebook feed from Channel 4. Binged in one sitting.",

But nothing could have prepared me for that.\n\nI went into it only told that he runs simulations to help people with anxieties. Other than that I went in completely blind.\n\nWe watched all 6 episodes back to back while coming up on an edible that was a lot stronger than I had expected.\n\nA few episodes in it became a bit challenging to tell who was an actor, who was not an actor, who was an actor but was not acting‚Ä¶\n\nThe final two episodes caught me COMPLETELY off guard. So fucking hard to watch but an incredible picture into Hollywood, into the psychology of fatherless young boys. Incredibly sad, like watching a trauma be born. Fuck that was insane.\n\nTo start the series with Kor the ‚Äúeducational fraud‚Äù, then going into the antisemitism, and then to end it on a legitimate trauma on camera.\n\nMy biggest takeaway is this: thank fucking god for my mom.",
