I found something interesting Law learnt something from his battle against the Yonko which is that strong haki can nullify devil fruit ability (pic1) which is the reason why he couldn’t move Big mom or Kaido during the rooftop battle(pic2)\n\nHowever for some reason this doesn’t make sense as in this scene(pic3) Captain Kid clearly uses his DF ability on big mom which is he’s Awakening which assigns magnetic properties to whatever he touches but isn’t big mom passive haki so strong that even law couldn’t move her this made me come to the conclusion that Haki cannot nullify awakened DF abilities why is that important.\n\nKid is fighting the Haki master Shanks everyone assumes shanks is gonna walk through however I don’t think so.\nWhat would happen if kid assigned a magnetic field to Shanks and the ground he could slam shanks into the ground constraining him like Fujitora’s ability. What if kid assigned the same magnetic field to himself and shanks like like poles in a magnet  shanks wouldn’t be able to get close to him without the repulsive force taking place allowing kid to use long range attacks.\n\nAnother question can Kid assign a magnetic property to water like the ocean and another object an throw the object at the enemy creating tsunami. I feel like there are lots of possibilities Oda can take with Kid and his ability.\n\nThis Reddit thread explains the potential of Kid’s awakening way better than me and it’s where I got the idea from.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/sdyvtk/kidds_potential_is_so_much_he_can_even_turn_into/",

        "text": "I just wanted to point out that I find it weird how much people disregard how individual matchups would play out and just apply Dragonball Z logic. And I'm not even referring to matchups such as Ice vs Fire and such but rather to things like personality and strategy.\n\nThis is for instance a big reason as to why people absolutely hated the fact that Luffy was struggling against Foxy. Although it absolutely makes sense.\n\nIn Thriller Bark, Zoro mentioned that Luffy's biggest weakness is Trickery. It was helpful of him to remind the Strawhats of that because they were fighting Oars who had Luffy's personality. In addition to this, Moria had an easy time messing with Luffy when he was chasing him around, tricking him constantly because of how clueless Luffy was. Luffy vs Foxy was pretty much all trickery. Luffy was so easily fooled that he accumulated immense amounts of damage. Granted it wasn't always Foxy himself who applied that damage but him being somebody who can pull those tricks still has to be considered as part of his fighting repertoire. Another example would be Luffy's fight against Ussop who is also all about trickery. The problem with all of these fights however was always that it was never enough to get Luffy down because his willpower was simply too strong. Up to the point where Luffy deals the finishing blow, Luffy was always losing.\n\nNow since Blackbeard is likely to be Luffy's final (or one if his final) opponents, it would only be fitting that the guy who tricked his way to the top and is a natural counter to Luffy will end up fighting him at the end. Luffy is a straightforward guy who bulldozes his way to the top, fighting whatever obstacles gets in his way head on while Blackbeard is the most calculating person in the series who only fights when he knows that he has the advantage. Even if Luffy turns out to be stronger from a strength standpoint during that battle, Blackbeard's strategical approach always needs to be considered, too.\n\n(One final thing that I noticed while writing this is that I feel like Zoro and Sanji have purposefully been made strong in those aspects in which Luffy is the weakest. Zoro is good against Swordsmen to which Luffy is weak against and Sanji is good against Trickey. Pretty much all of Sanji's fights involve him fighting against such an opponent)",

Put his plan into action when he got yami yami nomi , But after teech ate yami yami nomi , he was able to become one with xebec, and the current bb is a mixture of both teech and xebec , who is strong-minded and coward at same time. Moreover , BB has a very vast knowledge about DFs and knows how to own one's DF after killing , Oda even said in a SBS that BB's fav hobby is archeology. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[In this the one who gives speech is xebec and the one who was in bar was teech that's why it's a foreshadowing that zoro said IT'S THEY](https://preview.redd.it/0hewmsqhldka1.png?width=800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8852b32125779f2f4ee08c4933fd6e6eaaa2ecc5)\n\n**A POSSIBLE FUTURE**  \n\n1.

It's clear that Shanks and Teach would win, it's 25y we know they will join the final saga.\nKid &amp; Law have become part of Luffy's trip and I don't think Oda would definitely eliminate them. On the other side, Kid already lost an arm versus Shanks' crew and apparently Blackbeard does not take prisoners, expecially when he'd like to steal his/her fruit.. I think Law fruit and poyenegrif would be a super plus for him.\nShanks' crew have no problem to kill people (see Lucky Roo VS bandits) and that open a bit the worst scenario for Kid. \n\nAssuming Oda won't kill Kid and Law (as ever) and that he is using them just to keep our mind away from Egg Heads real info.. I think we have several options:\n- Kid will loose, but he will survive since now he is stronger than when he lost his arm. The lost will be too much so he will be out of screen for many time. \n- Law will loose, but something will save his life.. I cannot think at anything right now, cause I don't think Oda will use again an expédient like Rayleigh.\n- Someone/Something will interrupt both matchs btw Teach and Shanks will take poenyegrifs\n- Law would be helped before death by Garp\n- Kid will be saved by Luffy's arrival\n\nHave you any better (Oda-plausible) idea?",

        "text": "For this theory, I was inspired by other interesting theories on this subject. But I think Chapter 1076 is the one that puts all the pieces of the puzzle together.\n\nIn chapter 957, Sengoku told us about the most powerful members of the Rocks' crew. Kaido, Big mom and Newgate are the most famous and their names were mentioned first...\n\nBut 4 other pirates were also mentioned: \"Shiki the golden lion\", \"Ochoku\", \"Captain John\" and also \"Silver axe\".\n\nWe know Shiki really well. We've seen Captain John in the past and know that Baggy is looking for his treasure.\nOchoku was defeated by Blackbeard after the Rocky Port incident.\n\nAs you can see, the only one to remain an enigma is \"Silver axe\".\n\nIf Oda mentioned his name, it's because he'll also have an importance for the rest of the story, that's why it is quite obvious that many theories have been made about him !\n\n\nSo I think there was a parallelism between Blackbeard vs Ochoku &amp; Shanks vs Silver axe.\n\nBut who is Silver axe ?\n\nI think he was a giant. But not just any : the most powerful giant. And here's why :\n\nWe know that the giants love Shanks, they respect him as a warrior because it's likely that he has defeated all the strongest Elbaf warriors ! \n\nThe law of the strongest being important, this would not be at all surprising. \n\nWe also know that Shanks isn't the king of elbaf, we've only heard of Prince Loki, but maybe Thor and Odin also exist. So I think Silver Axe was respected as Elbaf's most powerful warrior, but not necessarily the king  (which would explain why he wasn't mentioned as an emperor). At least, Elbaf wasn't his territory, unlike Shanks. It was his natal country. \n\nSince giants age very slowly, it's possible that Silver Axe still has the same level of power as God Valley. \n\nIn Egghead Island, sentomaru told Luffy to stop calling him by his weapon (an Axe), which could be a wink to this character. Also, what's better than an Elbaf warrior to be called by his weapon! \"Silver Axe\" is cool af !\n\n\nNow, here's the most interesting part : why Big Mom never owned Elbaf as a territory ? \n\nThe answer is because she couldn't control this land.\nSilver Axe was probably really strong, the army is the most powerful in the world and finally : Giants hate her. Even if she (like Shanks) tried to defeat every single Warrior, they won't like her and won't ever see her as their leader.\n\nThat means that even if she send some of her sweet commanders, they would get their a** mopped. So impossible.\n\n\nIf 6 years ago, Shanks became a yonko, it's because he managed to defeat the most powerful giant and because they all respect him. Now, he has the world's strongest army under his hand, and also the strongest country. Without counting every captains that are allied with the Red hair pirates and every little territory he owns in the new world. He also knows what is the One Piece, maybe is the strongest pirate alive and finally : don't search to disturb the world's ballance.\n\n\nIn conclusion : his actual bounty and his Yonko title are TOTALLY deserved.\n\n\nNote : if Shanks managed to beat Silver axe 6 years ago, I also think that Mihawk defeated someone in the past.",

        "text": "I just recently read the entire series over about 3 weeks and, like many people, have browsed social media for theories, explanations, and summaries. One recurring discussion that seems to take place is that of Buggy's future and Shanks plans. To me, it's rather obvious.\n\nWhen the Roger pirates came back after visiting Laugh Tale it was  traumatic for several reasons for Shanks and Buggy. First, the imminent disbanding of the pirates meant these two were unlikely to get to Laugh Tale soon. Secondly, they were about to lose their father figure, a man that seemed invincible and became king of the pirates. As the only children of the Roger Pirates I think Roger made a very big request for the boys that each responded to very differently: He asked them to guide and support Joyboy. Roger was obviously not going to live to see the prophetic child born and the rest of the pirates would all be quite old in the next era.\n\nShanks being the self-sacrificing type took that request as his life's mission. He recovered the Nika fruit and knowingly or unknowingly gave it to the prophetic child, Luffy. He then lost his arm saving the boy, saved him again at Marineford, and is now protecting his allies as seen by his intervention between Wano's defenders and Greenbull. Additionally, the reason he maintains distance from Luffy is that he believes that his constant involvement in Luffy's struggles would impede his growth and beliefs. Children with huge expectations placed on them by others is genuine problem not only in fiction, but also in the real world. It may be hard for the fandom to have Shanks teased so much, but I think this is a man so dedicated to Roger, Luffy, and his mission that he will sacrifice his own happiness to see Luffy's potential reached.\n\nI think Buggy, on the other hand, took Roger's request and death a lot harder. He became jaded and embittered with Roger's request and thus became a colder and manipulative pirate. You can still see remnants of his good guy persona battling with who he's become. I think eventually we are going to see Buggy have an identity crisis upon realizing that Luffy is Joyboy's reincarnation. I also believe that Buggy might be a \"D\" or at least an artificial one. The will of \"D\" has been described as \"the uncanny ability to attract friends, allies, and even befriend former enemies or unexpected people\". If we look at his character arc, he's constantly bringing groups of people together even when it's unintentional.\n\nIt's quite clear that this series will end with a giant conflict between Blackbeard and/or Imu and Luffy is going to need a giant allied fleet. He's already going to have his Grand Fleet, but Shanks and Buggy, as his stewards, will have assembled their own grand fleets to help him free the world. Thanks for reading!",

Pre Timeskip, Scratchman Apoo tried and failed to use his devil fruit abilities on Kizaru.\n\nBut, in the Marineford arc, we can see Akainu being hurt by Whitebeard’s devil fruit attacks. I don’t know for sure if he imbued haki on his body or his devil fruit ability itself because Busoshoku Haki wasn’t visible to us back then. Plus, I don’t think Whitebeard managed to hurt Akainu because his fruit(Quake-Quake) is a natural weakness to Akainu’s(Magma-Magma), like Luffy and Eneru.",

Because the crew includes Luffy(captain), Zoro, ussop, nami, sanji, chopper, Robin, brook, Franky, and jinbei. Now, if we exclude luffy as a crewmate as he is the capitain, we get 9 crewmates. Whereas if we add him, then it's 10people. I know there is no hierarchy in luffy's crew but HE IS the captain. So maybe we'll see another member?",

If this is so then we have already seen that cloud thingy on luffy - in his gear 4th. We had a straight up dialogue in wano arc about how luffy's gear 4th looks like a storm god or something and I would love for that to be a hint into gear 4. I know this is probably not true and Im just connecting 3 disconnected things but I thought it sounds like an interesting idea unless someone already has made this connection in which case, I also think this is interesting!

This just seems crazy, so I was thinking maybe he used haki and didn’t realize it. If it wasn’t armament haki then is was observation because there’s no possible way a human could sense the vibrations like that. What do yall think?",

        "text": "I believe kid vs shanks won’t be so one sided as many people think it will be this is where kid will prove himself to be an emperor.\n\nkid has the potential of recruiting 3 people.\n\nfirst off in sbs 102 oda revealed kids crew names and designs kid has 30 members in his crew the problem here is this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ftklm7g3cka1.jpg?width=1205&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a9cf293d7becd60aa06b6f42b92c2f0cbc0dc254\n\noda clearly left out 9 people. He drew 22 here.\n\nThe only reason oda must have left out 9 people is because he’s likely saving them for a bigger reveal or they haven’t been recruited yet but kid endgame will have 30 members.\n\nnow we have seen 2 guys in kids crew who are absent here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4m9ybzi3cka1.jpg?width=480&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e89a957809237dd2c8a7ef6e38210b6ebebb1187\n\nthose 2 guys in the back\n\nI believe killer heat wire and the other 9 will be kid’s top commanders the rest of them are just members likely on the same level as the grandfleet captains.\n\nThe same applies to shanks.\n\nshanks has 30-40 something members on his crew but there are clearly like 10 people who stand out more there are well designed and named members and generic members who fill up space.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bi6w6jyj3cka1.jpg?width=736&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=773a83a546a89ce77d9e7f3cadb57436f37f8394\n\nSo if it’s the later and we haven't seen the remaining 9 because they haven’t joined yet then here are my candidates for 4 of those positions.\n\nfirst off. A giant\n\nKid alongside law are credited for taking down big mom and I can see kid being viewed as a sort of hero by the giants who still hold a grudge against her.\n\nHajrudin Holds a grudge against big mom due to her killing chief beardfall\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/snh984lm3cka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d63d741d71f1377fdc0cde6fafad0ded843677aa\n\nso could Hajrudin leave the grandfleet and join kid out of respect for taking down his true enemy and knowing kid is in danger in his homeland ?\n\ncould Hajrudin leave the grandfleet and join kid knowing kid is in danger in his own homeland where kid and law should be held as heroes ? I mean it’s not the first time Hajrudin left a pirate crew on a whim\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yledg8vo3cka1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0f261a1db7a325e1928501e145a8ff14df02e96b\n\nIt could be loki who was scorned by big mom and was insulted by her disrespect\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2ejtx7ls3cka1.jpg?width=271&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=78ea22f899267755161a792551cff69642fccce8\n\neither way I don’t expect all the giants to be on shanks side and some will join kid out of respect others might join luffy and law but that’s not the discussion today. but could kid recruit a chief of a giant clan on his side ?\n\n2nd rockstar\n\nThis is a harder sell as he is a shanks pirate\n\nBut he has kid vibes I mean he even looks like him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g45klrrt3cka1.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=92b466488869d9b4663e6c9613542bd6424a09b0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l4t0hsrt3cka1.png?width=200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e616c7aaa880eaa40e8f36b37aa56e6e775e1018\n\naccording to rockstar he’s a rookie so he’s probably to young to join the absent father club with yassop but maybe he’s like an older brother ?\n\nin another theory I have i put the blame on rockstar for killing kid’s childhood friend Victoria which explains kids grudge with shanks, so if that’s true then here I just say kid kills him.but if it’s not then what if rockstar fights kid and is beaten to a pulp so badly that rockstar in a moment of fear for shakes his loyalty to shanks and bends the knee to kid.\n\nkids crew are all named after punk rock references so a guy named rockstar could fit the vibe.\n\n3. The hardest sell I have…….Bartolommeo\n\nyes the number 1. Fanboy to luffy.\n\nthis is a hard one to sell I will admit I won’t blame you if you ignore me from this point on and dismiss this theory but give me a chance!\n\nso not just 1 but 2 grandfleet captains I see as candidates?\n\nbarto if he didn’t witness luffy first might have been drawn to kid. They are very similar.\n\nfirst Off both are punks with bad reputations.  Barto attire is a typical punk attire\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ru0zzxrd2cka1.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8c5775c6581a00b10c1334aa084b6a645b1bff28\n\nhe is also extremely rude to other people and seems to enjoy doing it \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlike when he starting peeing in front of thousands of on lookers just to get a rise out of them or how his crossing fingers is also a reference to a rude Japanese gesture.\n\nHe’s also prone to violence over the smallest of insults like when he heard someone insult luffy and then slammed them into a wall and threatened to cut off their tongue \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jf927nw2cka1.jpg?width=320&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1d7883f8563b57029f96ec85602d7d139072597c\n\nby all means he is a punk.\n\nhe was also the leader of a small yakuza gang.\n\nbefore he was a pirate he ran a gang in Loughtown but was inspired by luffy to become a pirate. Before kid became a pirate he was also a yakuza leader on his home island according to sbs 104,now how can this even happen?\n\nwell you see barto also has beef with shanks.\n\nbarto attacked shanks territory \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/efc2o5b44cka1.jpg?width=605&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c4ce2ed186c164a4228d6c29840efaaae742934a\n\nand shanks said he has to retaliate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95pik5ze4cka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eb28f650f806e83e0c0619442387f076da2bbc0a\n\nso I can see a scene happening where kid is being attacked and it’s revealed barto is on one of the ships tied up and beaten to a pulp himself and we are told his crew were killed by shanks crew after all shanks can be ruthless \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wovqu5rw4cka1.png?width=2160&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=71e14bd62bc3cf85e3bb5731a03aae7346455e5d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zx1tk5rw4cka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5efcb1e09e6d71bc24b558e7ff71fcb13a2dfa87\n\nin the fight maybe kid uses his power and accidentally frees Bartolommeo maybe kid comes across him and has pity on him Seeing him as another punk like him who lost to shanks and takes him in.\n\nI also don’t know what the trigger will be for him to betray luffy but maybe Bartolommeo escapes sees kid and remembers the news and thinks kid is a friend of luffy and jumps aboard to fight the common enemy and at some point in the future he meets luffy again and gets exited but when luffy hears About what’s been going on maybe luffy will just casually say something like “ you attacked shanks territory and put my flag up there ? That’s not cool you idiot i hope shanks doesn’t blame me for that you know he is my friend after all he’s the one that gave me my hat “\n\nbarto after losing his crew hearing how luffy kind of sided with shanks will be heart broken and in return leaves and joins kid full time.\n\nIn a way this reminds me of squard who lost his crew to rogers and joined whitebeard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vodyo3u6cka1.jpg?width=711&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fcf5c5b783382670848645d92a41493b2dea0940\n\nalso how much if a troll moment would that be from oda,  it would beat Yamato saying she will join the crew for a year only to say no at the last second.\n\n4th now this one is more for the sake of throwing it out there but what about gin ?\n\nim not sure how he comes into the story but since oda seems to be bringing back all these characters from the past like wapol and the giants of little garden I think gin return is soon.\n\nwhen shanks returned in wano he was drinking a bottle which spelled out 67  5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8yja1ysi7cka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ab25eaf02429c4aa7881dfea908b016f9a498286\n\nchapter 67 page 5 is where gin said he was going to choose his own path and not just blindly follow someone just because he feels obligated to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit’s the same chapter where he tells them he will see them in the grandline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0myohmv18cka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ddfd730df2f6384a26353e9eec02d7e9af2e3b31\n\nI am not sure how this works out like I said but in kids crew it would fit another dynamic.\n\nkid is rivalled with luffy and killer is rivalled with zoro I don’t see hear or wire being compared to sanji but sanji did fight gin and gin won.\n\ngin could be the sanji of the kid pirates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gw4jtcl19cka1.jpg?width=735&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8ccb049a845ea2973a431a542c0da4aea77661da\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u487ppc39cka1.png?width=1620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=11e57491effb7cc91b359c99af23ead3259f5859\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rhs99wa9cka1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=08f0b68a6e58cc4cdfa3df334dd89a6089b9f90e",

There, it is also stated that a 1-years-old Shank was found in a chest by Roger (while in?) after the God Valley incident. Pretty specific information I guess, I think it eludes to Shanks having some connections to Celestial Dragons which in turn might explain why he was permitted a meeting with the Gorosei at the Reverie. I don't believe Shanks to be a Celestial since it's too similar a case with Doflamingo's and i also hope he is not related to them in any way. Maybe something to do with Xebec?

        "text": "I only started reading the manga from wano so I don't know if this was mentioned before but I don't understand why Shanks wants kid's poneglyphs??\nI always assumed Shanks had all 4 already ( since he already knew their location from his trip with Roger).\nThe last chapter kind of implied that he doesn't which I found very confusing, I mean the guy even has access to the 5 elders.\n\nSo why do you think he waited this long to go for the 4 poneglyphs ? I can only think of 2 possibilities for why he wants kid's poneglyphs: \n\n1. He knew he needed to wait for Joy boy and didn't bother collecting the poneglyphs. But this would imply that the reason he decided to go now is because he realized that Joy boy is back? Which could imply that he knows Luffy is Joy boy ( This could be possible if he knew all along the nature of Luffy's fruit. So seeing his wanted poster made him realize \"Joy boy has returned\". )\nBut even if that is the case, it still doesn't make sense that he waited so long to collect the poneglyphs because there was always the risk of someone finding them before him. \n\n2. He already has all 4 poneglyphs and he just wants Kid's poneglyphs to keep Kid away from Laugh Tale.",

        "text": "I think we may know how the poneglifs and the realms in which they have appeared (Arabasta, Skypiea-Shandora, Gyojin Island, Zou, Wano...etc) are connected.\n\nFirst of all, all the above mentioned realms have a similar geographical shape. The most obvious similarities are those of Wano (A elefant tree) and Zou\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ysd6mzfr5bka1.png?width=662&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3a4f3a3a52a2a78b4469481df07948ef9f7f3341\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eke5x5lu5bka1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=107b09f24ca86b8c6ee2d1b2b0cb5825ae27a6b3\n\nSecondly, there are other elements that connect them and help to explain the presence of poneglifs, such as the fact that they are islands of volcanic character. In the arch of Skypiea it was explained to us that this type of islands produce gases that result in cloud-islands, the place where the birkans and shandians stayed some time later. Skypiea and Wano are, in fact, volcanic islands, such as Rusukaina for example. The shared history between the islands does not end there. An example of this is that in Arabasta there is a river called \"Sandora\", curiously the same name by which the ancient golden city located in Jaya was known. Coincidence? I don't think so\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dz2h3lyl8bka1.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9e4c57446b4d34fad1118392e626ba22e5c52929\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThirdly, these islands share a sun-worshipping culture. In Skypiea 4 gods are mentioned; the sun god, the rain god, the forest god and the earth god. The national symbol of Arabasta is a sun, and that of Zou, Gyojin Island, like that of the country of Wano, and maybe Rusukaina (Women Island) bears a strong resemblance to the sun. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p8aj70f27bka1.png?width=180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7cc6535cfcb4fd734ce5622b05633b8ea903d7fd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ft0mseq37bka1.jpg?width=191&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e1bc59ba8a659890d9347c0ce120975c73b898d4\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o6bvuqo47bka1.jpg?width=328&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e5512a14cc8966e383c56eb86f6e664ac6dc98a5\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqtdflr57bka1.jpg?width=266&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cb55d1ff266a19031f97b09bdec510043a62bf1f\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, my particular theory is that 900 years ago the D civilization, which was defeated by the WG, extended into a supercontinent, something like the primordial Pangaea. This place encompassed Jaya, Arabasta, Wano, Gyojin Island and other realms visited by the Mugiwaras that have two things special; the presence of poneglifs and ancestral weapons. The latter were mentioned in Arabasta (Pluto) and Skypiea (Poseidon). Thus, if the supercontinent ever existed it would explain:\n\nA) The shape of the islands (they fit together).\n\nB) The means of transportation of the poneglifs, since being in the same physical space the effort of moving such stones would not be so heavy.\n\nFinally, after the battle and being the D defeated by the use of some ancestral weapon (I lean towards Uranus) the result was the dismemberment of that great kingdom in small islands, caused by the direct impact of the ancestral weapon or the subsequent cataclysm (that would explain the existence of the Red Line as a barrier that protects from the rise of the sea level).",
