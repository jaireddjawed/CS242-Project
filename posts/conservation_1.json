The first one went super well and I expect the same for the second one. The thing is that I have no experience doing any conservation work. I'm worried that the people I am leading will have more experience than me and I won't be able to lead them effectively. The primary reason that I wanted this job was to gain and improve leadership skills while being outside and doing all the fun stuff that a conservation corps does.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I want to take the leap but I don't want to end up in a \"my crew leader was so bad\" situation and make my group's experience not as great as it could be with someone else. Should I step aside and just work as a crew member this year or should I go for it?",

        "text": "The Census of Environment is a new program that aims to provide foundational data on Canada’s ecosystems to help monitor environmental trends. Cataloguing all the ecosystems in Canada is an important step in helping Canadians make evidence-based decisions to protect, rehabilitate, enhance and sustain the environment. While policy makers currently have access to a wealth of economic and socioeconomic information when making critical decisions, it is much more difficult to get the full picture on Canada’s ecosystems and their benefits. The Census of Environment will provide that missing piece.\n\nThe overarching objective of the Census of Environment is to deliver a full picture of the complex relationship between ecosystems and the economy, society and human well-being in one easily accessible location.\n\nThis will in turn\n\n* allow all levels of government to develop policies and legislation that support healthy ecosystems and preserve natural capital\n* serve to inform planning by cities and municipalities\n* support decision makers in key economic sectors, including industry and agriculture\n* assist individual Canadians in their understanding and decision making.\n\n[Learn more about this project here.](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects-start/environment/census?utm_source=rddt&amp;utm_medium=smo&amp;utm_campaign=statcan-coe-rde-22-23)\n\n*\\[We are Canada’s national statistical agency.

L’établissement d’un inventaire de tous les écosystèmes au Canada est une étape importante pour aider la population canadienne à prendre des décisions fondées sur des données probantes afin de protéger, de restaurer, d’enrichir et de préserver l’environnement. Bien que les décideurs aient actuellement accès à une mine de renseignements économiques et socioéconomiques lorsqu’ils prennent des décisions cruciales, il est beaucoup plus difficile de dresser un portrait complet des écosystèmes du Canada et de leurs avantages.\n\nL’objectif général du Recensement de l’environnement est de fournir un portrait complet de la relation complexe entre les écosystèmes et l’économie, la société et le bien-être humain en un seul endroit facilement accessible.\n\nCes résultats contribueront à :\n\n* permettre à tous les ordres de gouvernement d’élaborer des politiques et des lois qui favorisent la santé des écosystèmes et préservent le capital naturel;\n* éclairer la planification des villes et des municipalités;\n* soutenir les décideurs dans les principaux secteurs économiques, dont l’industrie et l’agriculture;\n* aider les personnes au Canada à mieux comprendre la situation et à prendre des décisions.\n\n[Pour en apprendre plus sur ce projet, cliquez ici.](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/fr/sujets-debut/environnement/recensement?utm_source=rddt&amp;utm_medium=smo&amp;utm_campaign=statcan-coe-rde-22-23)\n\n*\\[Nous sommes l’organisme national de statistique du Canada.

        "text": "Hi everyone! I’m looking to pursue a master’s degree in wildlife conservation. I’ve been focusing my search on programs that are online as I’m unable to attend in-person classes at this point in my life due to costs and work. I recently got accepted into UF’s Wildlife Ecology and Conservation program and I’m still waiting on a couple of more decisions. It’s a good start and I’m excited to get my graduate studies rolling soon.\n\nHowever, today I discovered a group on Facebook called “Wildlife Career Science Network” and after spending some time reading through their posts, I couldn’t help but notice that a lot of people on there seemed to be very “anti” online degree. One guy even claimed that employers (probably him tbh) will not consider an applicant for a position if they see that they obtained their master’s degree online. \n\nI know I should take everything I read on the internet with a grain of salt, but I can’t help but feel unsure about going for an online graduate degree after reading all of that. Are employers really that judgmental and weary of online programs even if they’re from reputable/respected schools? I understand that the lack of hands-on work is a downside when it comes to taking classes online, but field experience can still be gained through internships, volunteering, and through independent/supervised labs and research. It just doesn’t make sense to me.\n\nWill I be shooting myself in the foot in terms of career advancement if I pursue an online degree? Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",
