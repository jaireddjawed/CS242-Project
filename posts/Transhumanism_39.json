        "text": "Background: finished first year of a bachelor in software engineering where I learned C# programming and software development/modelling, finished most of the first year courses of a bachelor in biomedical sciences (lot of biology, some genetics), finished a bachelor in psychology &amp; neuroscience, and am on my way to finishing my master degree in health care psychology (psychotherapy).\n\nI'm interested in a lot of stuff and find it hard to figure out how to proceed after I finish my degree. I actually enjoy the profession of the psychotherapist. I think it's fascinating to work with people to help them understand themselves better and tackle some roadblocks. However, I'm afraid I might get bored doing this each day. Plus I would like to do something that contributes to the progress of technology and science. Considering my background and the fact that I'm broadly interested, do you think a PhD might be a good idea? What would you suggest (either as PhD subject, or as other pursuit)? I do know I would probably enjoy a lot of the elements of a PhD. Contributing something new and fresh, coming up with ideas, testing them, analysing data - all stuff I'd enjoy. Some subjects I was thinking about are brain computer interaction, BCI and/or VR, neurofeedback, but also things like AI and deep learning, although I'm not sure I presently have the knowledge for that. It probably requires more coding skills than the one year of C# I did a few years back... I was thinking about possibilities for a more broad-scope PhD since that seems to be more fitting for me, but I'm not even sure such a thing is possible. Like a PhD connecting many different sciences, integrating fields and knowledge.",

Unfortunately I haven't gotten around to seeing it yet, so please, no spoilers.  \n\nBut I'm really here because I'm looking for an introduction into this realm. I've done a bit of research and there's a ton of books that look interesting to me, but I'm not sure where to start. I recently came upon an audiobook version of How to Create a Mind by Kurzweil, but I've heard mixed things about it. I've listened to nearly an hour of it, and it's rettibly dry and uninteresting to me. I realize it hasn't really gotten to any of the real meat yet, but all the same. I'm curious if there's a better starting place.  \n\nI'd prefer to stay away from fiction right now, although I've noticed a lot of recommendations made in the past have been novels. Is that the best option, or are there some non-fiction options that would be a bit more interesting or easier to digest?",

(or if you want to bring germline engineering out of the equation as well just make enough embryos in the lab and take the best one which is even more unethical) ",

I've seen it mainly mixed between the two in the photo (thought it'd be easier to show you). If I get it directly on the tip I'll be able to feel more because of the higher density of nerves but it could get in the way in day to day life and if I put it in the side I'm concerned that I won't feel different fields as that is mainly what I want the implant for. \n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/zC95s\n\nThanks guys",

        "text": "I'm convinced that the tools for safe, effective, and not overly expensive (about the price of a new car by my estimation, at least at first) genetic enhancement in adults exists and can be used.  I think the myostatin gene would be a good place to start.  I have a good idea of how it will work:\n\nWe use [enhanced specificity cas9](https://www.addgene.org/71814/) to knock out the myostatin gene with the [HVJ vector](http://www.cosmobio.co.jp/export_e/products/detail/products_isk_20070531.asp?entry_id=1752) because it can transfect muscle cells.  The real problems come with funding, production, and distribution.\n\nFunding is easily the biggest hurdle.  While I have no doubt that there is a huge market for this, I have no idea how to get money and how much I'll need.  Kickstarter or gofundme are possibilities, perhaps but I have no idea how reliable those would be.  Getting a venture capitalist to invest could work, but I doubt they would invest in someone with no business experience.  Any ideas would be welcome, especially a dollar amount to ask for.\n\nProduction would require a lab space and lab equipment to produce the RNA's for the espCas9 and the gRNA by having bacteria transcribe them and then isolating the RNA so we would need incubators and other equipment for that.  The vector would be another matter because the quantity needed to transfect a grown human is likely greater than what is sold on their site so maybe they have a bulk discount or we could figure out how to make it ourselves.  The rest would just be a simple clinical setup for injections, some office space, etc.\n\nDistribution runs into legal problems with the FDA and bioethicists so I don't know if it can be done in the US or Europe.  Maybe its legal if people give informed consent?  I need a lawyer to advise me on this.\n\nI would appreciate any thoughts and input from the r/transhumanism community.",
