        "text": "I was reading a few posts on AI. Particularly about children's books using AI artwork. This one post really caught my eye. It was a post about a children's book called Niko and Kai by Ahmet Khalil. A commenter wrote, \"stop promoting AI.\" I thought what's the big deal about this AI artwork? It seems to rattle a few nerves when brought up. I have a 5 and 7-year-old so I bought the book from Barnes and Noble (unfortunately the only store for the paperback in America. Amazon and Google have the ebooks.). First, this book isn't just a children's book. It seems to use a children's story with pandas to educate children on AI. \n\nAI is their future. It's not ours. Most parents will be retired before AI becomes a threat to jobs. I believe books like this will inspire kids toward science and engineering in a field that will dominate their future. I think of it like in Asian and Indian culture, they teach science and engineering at an early age. I think this book does an excellent job of doing that with AI in a fun and exciting way, as well as teaching kids how to be friends with someone who doesn't look like them. That's the theme of the book, a young red panda and a black and white panda realize they can be friends despite looking different from one another. (we are all human, we just look different.) With that said, I stand with AI.",

Our current civilization is defined by a combination of extreme interconnectedness, serious demographic problems, unhappiness, and a lack of culture and ideologies able to address our problems. A disturbing thought that I think many of us have considered is the similarities of the current world state to historical world-states that preceded chaotic eras.\n\nI am confident that humanity will continue advancing, but this may not be a straight line. The next pinnacle of human civilization may be preceded by hard times as our current society collapses and restructures itself. One way I think we might be able to avoid this is through the sheer brute force of technological advancements. For example, working fusion reactors could increase the overall quality of life and robustness of economies in developed nations by an order of magnitude and thus cushion the strain caused by other problems.",

We see it in the predictive abilities of Facebook and Amazon, and the spectator chants at sports events.\n\nOur social network bubbles reinforce this constantly, creating a sympathetic harmonizing of individuals into a larger single commonality of quasi community. \n\nA singularity, where the majority of the masses comfortably reside, and where it becomes increasingly difficult to find original thought or expression of ideas.\n\nThis merging is an existential threat to the creative arts if fewer people are interested or willing to invest in the effort required to think outside of the walls that they reside within.

        "text": "I know it’s from 1977 but science-fiction is usually a few centuries ahead in some areas. This question would seem very obvious but if you dig enough deep into the lore; you see that most of the obvious things are not true.\n\n•Computers: The computers used in the trilogy are analog; crude and clunky. However according to the book the Physics of Star Wars, almost all computers in Star Wars utilize some type of quantum computing because the midichlorian data would be too large for a regular computer to hold as data. Also I’ve read articles that analog computers may make a comeback as they are better for A.I. My headcanon is that the engineers have known this for centuries and that’s why analog is used.\n\n•Hypersonics: Some might argue that we have ships and missiles that can move at hypersonic speeds and Star Wars does not but the top speed of Padme’s yacht is within hypersonic range and once they get to orbit; it doesn’t matter anymore.\n\n•Ranged weapon: You can argue that the fighters in Star Wars cannot operate at long range while ours can. That is partially true. In Episode 8, one of the main ways to survive was range. That is because turbolasers must have a range. Then I read in one of the Legends books that they developed long-range turbolasers in the years after the Galactic Civil War\n\n•Holograms: They can make better ones like us. Look at that one of Snoke in The Force Awakens.\n\n•Smartphones: A datapad can fufill that function and I don’t see how it can be made to function as a comlink as well\n\nTouchscreens: Sabine Wren’s vambrances have this feature as did the chair in the Trade Federation control ship in Episode 1\n\nSo what is there that we developed in recent years that they don’t have?",

Some people may find the idea of interacting with a simulation of a deceased loved one comforting, while others may find it creepy or disrespectful.",

        "text": " Again, an idea I read in a fictional book: **The mental illnesses we all know today are basically not changed from Freud's time, for approximately a century**. The BIG 3 group of psychotic disorders, **schizophrenia**, **paranoia**, and **manic-depressive psychosis** existed back in those early days of the psychoanalysis movement and persisted to this very day. Yes, there were some new contenders added to the list in the past 100 years, like ADHD, Borderline Syndrome, or PTSP, but I am not talking about \"small stuff\". And I am also not talking about things like the alienation of millennials and Gen Z or their addiction to mobile phones and technology either.\n\nWhat I am talking about is the new \"major player\" that has been added to the \"big three\" list. This player is already among us and is much more sinister or dangerous than its \"big three\" siblings. Schizophrenia, for instance, distorts reality, allowing the person to cope with it and find some hope and comfort. Paranoia does the same, as the person feels they are being followed by the entire world, which can be comforting in a way. This new \"player\" is the complete opposite; it leaves the person out in the cold providing no methods of living that could give them any solace.\n\nClassifying this new mental illness and its importance will be the next big breakthrough in Psychology as a science. And it is coming sooner than you think.\n\nAgain, I want to be fair to the book and the author and not spoil the plot or reveal anything crucial, so, that was everything I could reveal. The book is a fine-grained psychological horror, '*Piaget's Last Fear*', but it's not for everybody, that's for sure. Anyway, it's an interesting idea to wrap your head around, isn't it?",

This video covers some cutting-edge biocircuit research using machine learning and speculates a little on the future of biocircuits - so I think it should appeal to people interested in our scientific future! But if this is the wrong place to post this kind of link, let me know and if possible please point me to somewhere you think would be more appropriate for people to engage with it :)\n\nHey everyone! First time posting here - I’m running a (very early days!) channel with myself and a few friends focussing on educational content creation in the biotech sector. The aim is to take cutting edge research and present it in a more accessible way than specialist papers; thereby helping to spread the message and spread the interest in the work done. The eventual goal is to try and build up a community where specialists and the general enthusiastic public alike can talk about some of the really awesome stuff that biotech can offer - and we'd like to kick this all off with biological circuits and synthetic biology!\n\nWhether you're a student, researcher, or simply curious about biotechnology, we'd love to get your feedback, so let us know what you all think :)",
