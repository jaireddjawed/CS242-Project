        "text": "About 10 years ago I worked in a call centre for a mail order company in Australia that also serviced customers from New Zealand. Some of the minor details have been modified for anonymity and because it's been years since this happened. Sorry it's so long!\n\nOne of the primary tasks that we had to perform was taking payments for orders. This could be done either over the phone by credit card, by faxing through a slip with credit card details, or by mailing a cheque. We strongly advised our customers not to send cash or credit card details through the post but it did happen from time to time.\n\nOn this particular day I had the pleasure to speak to an older lady (OL) from a small town in New Zealand who was trying to pay for a order using an installment plan that we offered on some of our higher priced products. Now, without trying to be offensive, it was the general consensus of our team that customers from NZ were usually harder to deal with because they tended to become irate far more quickly than our customers in Australia. Not sure why this is but after working there for 6 years that did seem to be the case.\n\nThe below is a summary of how the interaction went to the best of my recollection after so many years. I've removed the parts about confirming account details, etc.\n\nMe: Welcome to &lt;BUSINESS NAME&gt;. How can I help you?\n\nOL: You people keep sending me bills for my order but I sent you my money last week. Why do you keep sending me bills? It's causing me so much stress!\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, ma'am. Can you tell me how you made payment?\n\nOL: I told you I sent it last week. Are you not listening to me?\n\nMe: Ok, ma'am. I'm sorry that this has happened. I just need some details from you so I can try and sort it out. Would that be ok?\n\nOL: Don't talk down to me! I wouldn't be calling you if I didn't want you to fix your mistake.\n\nAt this point I realised that this was not going to be an easy one. She was irate from the outset and wasn't going to give up any info easily.\n\nMe: I realise you're frustrated by this and I'm going to do everything I can to get this fixed but I just need to know how you made the payment. Did you call up and pay by credit card, did you send a fax or did you post us a cheque?\n\nOL: *sigh* Can't you find this out yourself? You should know this already!\n\nMe: I'm sorry, ma'am but I've got no record of receiving a payment from you last week which is why we sent you a reminder bill. If you could just tell me how you made the paym...\n\nOL: ...I sent a fax. You should be able to see that or don't you know how to do your job? You've caused me so much stress. I've never had a reminder bill in my life!\n\nFinally! Some progress.\n\nMe: Thank you for that, ma'am. I'm sorry to ask but do you happen to recall on what day you sent the fax?\n\nOL: *sigh* Tuesday. I faxed it on Tuesday.\n\nMe: Excellent. Ma'am, would you mind if I place you on hold while I check our fax records for that day?\n\nOL: Don't keep me waiting. I'm paying for this call and I don't have a lot of money because I'm a pensioner.\n\nAfter putting her on hold (the calls were actually free for NZ customers regardless of how long they took but I wasn't about to contradict her) I went and checked our fax folder from the previous Tuesday and flicked through each fax. There were plenty of CC payment slips amongst the other enquiries but nothing that had her name on it. I took the folder back to my desk so I could resume the call with her, with a sinking feeling that this was going to get worse before it got better.\n\nMe: Ma'am, thank you for waiting. I've checked our faxes from last Tuesday and I can't seem to find any that have come from you. Are you sure it was Tuesday?\n\nOL: Of course I'm sure! I told you not to talk down to me! I have a fax confirmation right here that says I faxed it on Tuesday so you had better do your job properly and find that fax.\n\nMe: (internal sigh) I'm very sorry about this. I will check the faxed again while I've got you on the phone. *starts flicking through the pile* Can you tell me how much the payment was for?\n\nOL: I paid my monthly installment.\n\nMe: I understand, ma'am but if you could just tell me a figure it might make it easier for me to find the fax.\n\nOL: *sigh* It was $20. Do you even know what you're doing? You should know these things. You're supposed to be helping me.\n\nMe: *continuing to check the faxes* I am doing my best, ma'am. I understand your frustration and I will hopefully be able to...\n\nAs I'm flipping through the pages starting to feel like this wasn't going to end well, towards the bottom of pile for Tuesday was a single page that was completely blank apart from an image of a NZ $20 bill.\n\nMe: Uhhh, excuse me, ma'am. I just want to double check with you which type of credit card you used on the payment form that you faxed on Tuesday.\n\nOL: No, no, no. I told you I sent you money. Weren't you listening?!\n\nMe: I... see... So, when you faxed the money, was it a $20 bill?\n\nOL: That's what I just told you!\n\nMe: Ok. I think I can see it here.\n\nOL: Finally! You had better fix this up now and I want a written apology from you for the stress you've put me through.\n\nMe: Ma'am, I just need to ask you something. When you put the $20 bill in the fax machine, did it come back out the other side?\n\nOL: What on earth do you mean? Of course it did!\n\nMe: Ok, ma'am. I need you to understand that you can't fax actual money because all we get is a picture of the money. You still have the $20 bill.\n\nOL: Wha... ....  ........oh.\n\nOnce she had realised what a fool she had been she hung up. I kind of felt a bit bad for shattering her dreams of discovering a magical way to pay bills without actually losing any cash but she had been a total bitch for the whole call so I didn't hesitate to laugh and share the story with my team mates after the call ended.",

My dad did it when he was in college and he said it was extremely easy. It seems like a pretty good gig, there are 6 shifts a week(4 hours each) and you make your own schedule. You can also cancel a shift if you let them know by noon the day you need to cancel. You are supposed to work 3 shifts a week on average. Also, there are no shifts Friday or  That flexibility is really good as a student. Saturday. \n\nI have thick skin and don't mind when people talk shit to me at all so I don't think I will have a problem with that.\n\nI really have no idea what to expect, but I certainly hope I like it more than my current restaurant job!",

        "text": "Hi guys, I'll try to keep it short and sweet as I have a lot on my mind regarding my job. This is a throwaway account for various reasons. \n\nSo I currently work for a large Japanese call centre in one of their UK based call centres. We have many different service desks in the building who provide IT and Hardware support for various well known franchises, I happen to be on the desk for a certain well known fried chicken fast food joint. \n\nNow at first the job was fine as it was full time work but after 6 weeks to sit back and review my experience, I can say I've never wanted to leave a job faster. Here are my reasons simplified but descriptive:\n\n. Unsociable hours: I hate this so much, I don't mind that we have to do 2 weekends out of every 4 but the fact that I've already done two and they've put me on another 5 weekends in a row infuriates me. I don't mind doing the extra hours but I prefer having a life as well as a job.\n\n. Weekly/poor pay: Now bear in mind that this job is 40 hours per week standard with £8.25ph pay, yet in my previous job which was tablet sales and only on weekends in one month I was earning £10.50 ph including bonus for consistent sales which could be an extra £80 per month. For what we have to do in the job including solving various computer issues, removing viruses, swapping out hardware and putting up with absolute fucking morons we do not get paid anywhere near enough in my humble opinion. \n\n. Piss poor management: I don't know about you guys but considering I'm only 21 it's disheartening when even I can spot shitty management from a mile away. We have a main team leader and two supervisors who roam the desk in case anyone needs help. The manager is a lazy bastard, I booked holiday for a week ago about 3 weeks in advance, he didn't bother even looking at it despite me chasing him up about it and when he did eventually look at it just because my agency chased him up about it, he booked me in for the wrong fucking week!!! \n\nOne of our desk supervisors who we'll call Jack(not his real name) is an absolute wanker, the guy has zero management skills. He openly makes fun of people including myself, gets angry and throws tantrums like a giant man child when something goes wrong for him and actually had the nerve to raise his voice at me completely unprovoked the other day because I apparently did something wrong.\n\n. Training being far too short: Seriously this is pretty self explanatory. We were meant to have 4 weeks training minimum, we got thrown on the phones in less than a week. Then apparently it's our fault when we can't perform miracles on the phone.\n\n. Better treatment for certain employees: This one really does my nut in. Now in our team it's mainly young women, absolutely nothing wrong with that of course, when I say young they're hovering around 18-19 years old. But these women are some of the most toxic, bitchy people I've ever had the displeasure of working with. \n\nThey get away with so much and the managers don't even bat an eyelid, in fact I would go as far to say that they actually defend these women over the rookies for whatever reason. 95% of the time me and the two other new guys who started with me will be getting bombarded with calls and we'll look over to see this bunch of lazy fuck wits watching netflix, on facebook or just having a general natter, seem to always be on a permanent lunch break. Jack is guilty of letting them get away with it too, and then they have the nerve to try and tell myself off or the other rookies whenever we take 5 minutes to breath and have a laugh.\n\n. And finally, the stupid/rude/lazy customers: This goes without saying, customers can be some of the rudest bunch of cunty idiots in the world. Not gonna lie I do not wanna stereotype fast food workers but 95% of the staff I speak to on a daily basis from this certain finger licking good restaurant are some of the worst people to work with. \n\nThey lie about how long they've been on hold, complain when something needs replaced and worst of all when they do the exact opposite of what you tell them to do. I legit had a guy who was complaining because his orders weren't coming off his scree in the front of the place. I told him to go into his back office and reboot the computer, he tells me two minutes later that there's been no change when I know full well if he had rebooted it then the issue would be fixed. \n\nI asked him if he was in the back office and he said no he was in the kitchen like I apparently said....*FACEPALM*\n\nAnyways guys sorry for the rambling but that's pretty much everything I hate about working in a call centre. \n\n  ",

Often times there are situations that would be much more simple if I could disclose everything to a customer. \n\nIt's a daily situation that customers that have a phone that's under warranty and they want it replaced. Sounds like it should be simple and the phone will be replaced without any questions. Right? No wrong. \n\nI'm expected to take a minimum of 460 calls in a month, and of those calls I'm only allowed to have 2 warranty phones which don't test successfully for whatever issue its supposed to have. \n\nEven if you troubleshoot a phone thoroughly it's still possible to have it come back negative. Sometimes the warehouse does not test phones fully, customers describe the problem poorly (wrong codes are just as bad as if the phone had no issues) and certain issues are difficult to duplicate (overheating and short battery life). This leads to agents not wanting to mail warranty phones to customers. \n\nFrom a customer perspective a warranty means the phone is replaced no questions asked. From my perspective I want to mail out as few phones as possible because I'm going to be out of target if more than 2 phones test back without any issues. Customers see them as free whether it's needed or not, I see them as being $85 if it isn't needed and I'm penalized if it isn't. ",

What does this much call volume cost versus giving customers a little more notice? I know you couldn't care less about your TW customers because where are they going to go with their history, but I know you care about money. What would it save, you or even make  you to invent some kind of alternative arrangement?",

        "text": "I’ve been working for a major clothing company’s call center since Oct ’15. I work in a smaller dept for one of their sister companies and for the most part, it’s ok. There’s some issues, but that’s a text post for another time. However, today has been one of the worst shifts I’ve ever had, even beating out Tote Lady and Gift Card Guy.\n\nSo I got an email from a customer (we’ll name her Sarah) who was upset that her order was cancelled because the item sold out before we could fulfill it. The previous associate who answered her email profusely apologized (great), offered an alternative item (double great) and generally was really awesome and understanding. He offered to place a new order over email as long as she confirms her billing/shipping info. Like, if I were that customer, I’d totally be happy with the outcome.\n\nWell I log into my email server this morning and get this gem (I copy-pasted so many times for order notes I have it near verbatim):\n\n“You WILL overnight this new top to me with 30% off and my student discount and it better arrive on my doorstep by Monday. You WILL notify immediately when the other top comes back into stock and you WILL honor what I paid. I demand to be refunded the difference for both shirts and a credit for my next purchase with [brand name]. I cannot believe I had to wait 5 days just to be told my order cancelled, this is a joke and your customer service is a joke. If I don’t get what I want from you guys, you’ll be sorry that you messed up.“\n\nI was shocked and needed help phrasing this because a) this is Sunday and there’s no way in ice hell we could get a package delivered by Monday and b) this woman is clearly unhappy (or delusional) and I am not trained to handle escalated customers on my own. Naturally, none of my department’s leadership are here - they never are. So I call a sup from another dept for help and get this lackluster response of “uh well, I’m not really trained for emails so just call her and say you’re sorry”. Jeez, I could have done that.\n\nI decide to take action and left a short but detailed voice message for Sarah. I apologized deeply and really believe my tone showed how much I cared and wanted to make things right. I tell her that any charges will drop off in 3-5 business days. Because only charge once an item ships, I explained that I cannot credit her back because the order cancelled, so there’s nothing to refund. I say, “I’d be happy to honor the discounts you requested on a order for the new top, please call me back at this number so we can set up the overnight order to ensure delivery on Tuesday.”\n\nI even emailed her again with the same info. This was at 10am our time. I wait and wait, do other tasks and take other calls. Deep in my gut, I know shit’s gonna happen before the end of my shift because that’s how it always works?? 30 minutes before my shift ends, I check the company email and of course I get a new email from Sarah and it says this:\n\n“Well that’s a lie because my credit card shows you charged me [x dollars] for this order, so you DID charge me for this item and I want my money back. Why should I have to do all this work to contact YOU when YOUR company messed up? My billing and shipping are the same, so place the order. You are low on the totem pole and if I don’t receive my top at my house by Tuesday with the discounts AND my credit I will ask for your supervisor because you can’t even get this done. This is abysmal service and I want to be compensated for my awful experience with [brand name].”\n\nLike, this is probably the worst email I’ve ever received. I was so upset and there’s been very few times this job has made me so emotionally drained. \n\n So of course I set up the new order and even threw in a free $30 gift card because I want this lady to not have a reason to complain at all. I reiterate in the email that any charges will drop off per her bank’s processing schedule and apologize again for the poor experience. Since I clocked out, I haven’t heard back and I don’t really goddamn care at this point. \n\nThe real kicker of this story is that the shirt that was cancelled - no more than $30. It’s one of the cheapest shirts our company offers. I’d understand if this was one of our $400 leather jackets but a fucking overpriced t-shirt? Get a life.\n\n\n**tl;dr**: crazy woman emails me after her order cancelled. Wants x y z. I give her pretty much what she asks but she continues to be a complaining bitch. I'm drinking bourbon tonight.\n\n**Update**: I checked her account yesterday and so far, so good. No one else has had to deal with her crazy BS. Moral of the story is just give the bitchy lady free shit and she'll leave you alone (hopefully).",

I laugh now,  I'm not as cranky and I can breathe again. No more pit in my stomach every day.\n\n*Fair warning: This will only be worthwhile (used loosely) if you hate call centers as much as I do.*\n\nNow onto the real reason for my post; the shit I see on job boards about call center work. Some pay as low as $9 an hour and go up to $22- but most float around 9, 10 or 11. Having been in a call center....the shit you deal with is so far from $9-11 an hour. I am a firm believer that call centers offer crazy benefits because they *know* how shite the work is. I am in no way, shape or form ever going back to a call center but after this unemployment stint and being short on money...I can see where someone gets excited about a CC posting. \"$10,000 bonus! Make up to $2,500 in commission + base pay! Team lunch every Thursday!\" It's all just fluffy bullshit. If you are currently job hunting, I am sure you will have an idea of what this rant is about.\n\nOn top of that- even the way that titles are worded on job boards are so deceiving. Having worked in a call center, I can smell it from miles away but some of these titles are very misleading. I will open a \"Product Specialist Admin.\" posting and there it is...\"Receive inbound phone calls and make outbound calls\"...like fuck, really?!? Granted- some people love call centers and thrive in the competitive environment and more power to you. I wish I could have the thick skin--but the majority of people will probably not mesh well in that environment. It's almost like they are suckering people into it. \n\nAnyway...that's my rant as I sit here looking for jobs 9-5. Keep on keepin' on. x",

        "text": "Long time reader, first time poster.\n\nSo I have been working at customer care in a mobile phone company for almost a year now. I have pretty much accidentally found myself in a \"POC\" position. This means that my stats are not monitored too much, I have a good relationship with my superiors and collegues and I do a variety of tasks.\nI deal with billing, esculations, porting, technical, floor walking, training new agents, sales, offline work.\nIts a nice place to have gotten myself as the variety keeps me from losing my sanity.\n\nI could probably share one story a day but here is one from today.\n\nAnyone ever get those customers who you really want to just annoy becasue they are being rude and obnoxious?\n\nMe: Good morning, this is rach-2912 at mobile phone company, how may I help?\nAngry man: My fucking phone won't work\nMe: Ok, can you explain what is happening?\nAngry man: Your shitty company sold me a useless fucking phone.\nMe: Ok I really do need you to elaborate on the issue and I have to advise that this is a professional conversation and that swearing will not be tolerated.\nAngry man: I can't call anyone.\n\nOk so here I do dpa, customer is calling from a landline so I do some brief troubleshooting and I come to the conclusion that Angry Mans phone has just dropped its connectivity. Not very difficult at all.\n\nMe: Ok so have you tried to do a manual network search on your phone?\nAngry Man: Yes (he's getting a bit annoyed) why can't you fix my phone?\nMe: Sir, we have to troubleshoot this so we know whats going on. What happened when you did the search?\nAngry Man: Nothing, it fucking nothing. (At this point I just want to fix this issue and get rid of the guy so I don't mention the swearing)\nMe: Did any errors come up? was it searching and finding nothing? can you elaborate please?\nAngry man: No I can't remember. This is ridiculos, if you don't fix this in the next 2 minutes I want to be transferred to someone who knows how to do their job.\nMe: (ignoring what he just said) Ok so can you do another network search and tell me what it says.\nAngry man: Fine (pause) How do I do that?\n\nAnyway phone connects, baba bing baba boom problem solved.\n\nMe: Ok is there anything else I can help you with today?\nAngry man: You haven't helped me at all.\nMe: Sorry?\nAngry man: You don't know what you are doing\nMe: Sir, just to summarise here, was your phone working when you called today?\nAngry man: No\nMe: Is it working now?\nAngry man: Ah go fuck yourself you stupid ---------\nMe: *Drops call*\n\n\n\nSometimes I feel a bit mean when I try to wind people up like this. But the way I see it, if someone is going to be abusive towards me I am going to be just as hepful as I need to be. If a nice customer comes through I will bend over backwards to get them what they want/deserve but when people are abusive I will do only what I have to do.\n\nOn a side note, my employers have a policy that for abusive customers we have to give them a warning and if they continue to abuse us we can hang up at our own discretion. Dropped calls show in our stats and the call gets listened to. If it is deemed that they were being abusive its ok and a note goes into the customers account to warn future agents who get the customer.\nIf it is deemed we were in the wrong in hanging up, we get an official warning and are suppossed to call the customer back and apologise (I have only heard of this happening once)\n",

This support center, for whatever reason, metrics are not displayed. I dont know the call volume from day to day, other than the number of holding calls. So this summer, and every summer, its really busy. But this year, they upgraded their que software and I now have access to the number of inbound and outbound calls I get. On a typical day, Im getting around 70 + calls a day. The busiest day ive had in the last 6 months included 120 calls and on the slowest, im averaging 40 calls a day. Now our call center feels like a sinking ship this year. So many people are leaving and we are on mandatory overtime. This is week 4 of mandatory overtime and I fell like utter CRAP. My head is swimming half way through my shift and I really feel spread thin. So, given the 10 hour shifts, number of calls and the wage (11/hr) Am i being taken advantage of? My job includes billing support, modem, router, iptv, voip TS. I also call carriers for circuit issues, monitor enterprise grade routers / switches, also including loop-back testing and checking mail / radius logs via a terminal emulator. Its also been two years without a dime of a raise. Is this typical for a call center, or am I stuck in call center hell, and need to find another home?",

Before this role I was a compliance admin at the ISP (I went over contracts people signed for Internet/Cable), but I was bored. So bored I hated my life and was extremely depressed. \n\nThen my friend in the Business TSR said they were hiring. The team only hired once every few years because their schedule was 9 to 5 and you talk to IT staff/professionals. \n\nThe reason I took the job is, well, nobody buys cable anymore. Layoffs will happen. So I hopped to the business side after passing their Networking 101 test (What's DHCP, DNS, TCP/IP, etc. Explain how it works)\n\nNow it's just busy. Hour waits as we launched data products that take 2-3 hrs to troubleshoot, which drives up the queues. I applied to a Network Analyst job (tech support for Enterprise customers/Metro Ethernet), but I'll only find out if I got the job in Sept/Oct.\n\nDid I make a mistake going back on the phones? It's starting to feel very grindy, and while customers are nice for the most part, they can be dicks when service is down. Coax doesn't have an SLA, and every department is understaffed atm, so they often have to wait a few days for service to be resumed. To make things worse, when I have an escalation (because they're losing money), my supervisor has to spend all day talking to them. \n\nThe worst thing is residential TSrs don't respect me. We used to be respected, but the call centre moved to a different building, and we sit with operations. Res Tier 2/3 talk down to us, even though within the corporate structure we're their peers. We just got a Biz Tier 2 guy, which means the Res Tier 2 guys think they're peers with him, even though we all are paid far more than Res TSRs. It's humiliation to be talked down to just because they see me as a \"front line rep.\" \n\nSure we have a retentions department (6-8 people iirc), but all they really can do is say \"You're on a contract\" or \"here's a discount\". \n\nI'm just feeling burned out. My primary reason for taking this job was money. It was a 4K raise for me, and now I'm earning 40K in an extremely low cost of living area. I get 3-5 weeks of vacation a year (I take bank time instead of OT), work a 9 to 5, get a pension, and stock options. \n\nMy parents tell me to be grateful as many of my uni friends are unemployed, and I have a mortgage. However, I just don't know anymore. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "News of Transamerica’s plan to relocate the majority of staff from the Edgewood location to C St had the bar top roaring last night with Aegon Stories.\n\nThe Dutch based insurance giant is a major employer in Cedar Rapids. Chances are you know someone that works there. Ask them to tell you the story of their worst customer call or better yet….ask them about their worst supervisor.\n\nThe cubicles at Transamerica are flooded with these troll-like middle managers, with no actual role, other than making sure you’re answering the phone quickly. Some (not all) of em are real manipulative ego-maniacs.\n\nAs we were talking Aegon over a few beers, an unnamed employee dropped this gem about her latest team meeting.\n\nApparently there are members of this “team” that are quite sophomoric and say unflattering things about this supervisor in their IM’s. You know that’s an internal network right? They can check that shit.\n\nProving our theory that Transamerica middle-management plays no actual part in production, the supervisor spent time spying on the IM’s and compiling a list of Greatest Hit’s.\n\nShe’d just have to wait for the perfect opportunity to shoot down the attempted coup d’état. That came at the next team meeting, with the supportive “big boss” listening in from Florida.\n\nOur insider tells us the supervisor entered the room and quietly closed the door behind her. Without saying a word, she began circling the table with sticky notes, calmly placing them in front of each team member.\n\nOn the sticky notes, of course, was the hand written copy of specific offensive remarks.\n\nThe room fell silent in devastating awkwardness.\n\nNow that’s some first class sociopathic leadership right there! Way to go Aegon! It really is a family around here!\n\nThe Transamerica move to C St should lessen 5:00 PM traffic on Edgewood &amp; 42nd . The Gazette’s coverage of the Transamerica-hibu deal was shaky at best.\n\nOur source at hibu indicated this was a mutually agreed swap, while the Gazette’s use of a quote from Greg Tucker, the senior vice president at Transamerica, made it seem like “Aegon just came in and took our building, when we spent a lot of time working out a mutual agreement.”\n\nMaybe grab a second source next time George….tip from the pro’s 😉\n\nAEGON VP Greg Tucker has a resume longer than the entire staff at the CR Defender combined. He has all the degrees you could imagine. He should be a virtual master of communication based on his experience.\n\nBut as long-time Aegon employees will attest, his choice to call recent layoffs a “restructuring” is so funny it’s sick. Hey Greg, go back and look at the corporate bull crap TLIC was spewing in 2008. You’re saying the same shit.\n\nPick a new word!\n\nRestructuring is Aegon for:\n\n“We’ve found a new way to further stick it to our employees, so we can keep getting rich! We’re giving out chap stick this year at EA Days by the way! Food day is this Friday!”\n\nOne other disturbing trend emerging at the sweatshop located at 6400 C St SW.\n\nThe workers are so stressed out, so over worked, so underpaid, so sedentary…they’re collapsing at work.\n\nThese people are falling out of chairs with chest pains at a rate of at least one per month. Somebody gets wheeled out of Transamerica on a gurney so frequently, certain pockets of twisted employees gamble on the when and where.\n\nLet these folks get out and walk around Greg!\n\nTransamerica dramatically underpays a majority of their staff while subjecting them to days like this:\n\n(Directly from a TLIC employee….off the record of course….that’s how you tell the truth.)\n\n8:03 AM: Daily phone call from women in PA suffering from dementia, with no one to help. Her daughter seems to have emptied her account. She calls and writes hand written letters to us….every single day….with no memory of previous interaction. Somebody should help that women.\n\n9:37 AM: Phone call from middle manager, asking where I went from 9:00-9:02. How do you write “I was taking a piss” politely?\n\n9:38 AM: Daughter called to cash in Dad’s life insurance policy. The following is the correspondence….verbatim.\n\n“I’m sorry for your loss, may I ask when he passed away?”\n\n“Oh he’s not dead yet, but they’ve got him on life support. Can’t we just start the paperwork anyways?”\n\n“Sir, I apologize, but a person must be deceased before we can process a claim.”\n\n10:05 AM: Man just screamed “You can take that policy and shove it up your ass!” at me over the phone.\n\n11:29 AM: Just before lunch, slick salesman calls to show off for his client on speaker phone, questioning why I personally, hadn’t processed his loan for $125,000.\n\n11:48 AM: Logged out 18 minutes late for lunch because of 11:29 phone call that was out of my control. Will be penalized in my stats for this and thus, lose money.\n\n12:00 PM: Return on time from lunch to avoid further penalty. Scarfed down turkey sandwich I shopped lifted from the cafeteria, because I can’t afford food until pay day. The 12 minutes off the phone was nice.\n\n1:11 PM: EVAC alert comes over the intercom. Lady from Distribution getting carted out.\n\n2:00 PM: Weekly hour long with the sup to talk about nothing. Look over some numbers I already know about.\n\n3:01 PM: Another call from AM dementia lady. She had no idea who I was and told me her story again from the beginning. Not allowed to hang up on them.\n\n3:57 PM: Phone call from daughter of son who just died in a motorcycle accident. Cashing in that funeral policy.\n\n4:47 PM: Intentionally hanging on to a caller that didn’t fully hang up. Killing my stats, but I need a break. Just want to coast home until 5:00 PM.\n\n4:59 PM: Last minute call from 91 year old needing help logging into website.\n\n5:43 PM: Finally heading home! Thank God for those extra 43 minutes! I need overtime at $400/week for this shit.",

        "text": "This is a story from my time with Big Video Game Company where I provided in game support through chat for their big title at the time. The usual tasks were restoring deleted items and characters, investigating harassment reports, hunting down bots, and changing names that broke the rules. It's been several years so I've edited and paraphrased a bit for coherency.\n\nIn this tale it is important to know that at the time we only changed names that broke the rules. So if you picked a stupid, but not otherwise offensive name such as Stabit, you were stuck with it.  \n\nOn to the story!  \n\nA ticket comes in saying *\"My name breaks the rules so I need it changed\"*. The ticket was sent from a character named Stabit and a quick look at the account doesn't show any rule breaking names for any of the other characters.  \n\n\n&gt;**Me:** This is CSR WingAndTail. I understand you wanted to report a name?  \n&gt;**Stabit:** Yea, this character's name is offensive.  \n&gt;**Me:** Fortunately you name doesn't violate any of our rules so you'll be able to keep it. Was there anything else I could assist you with?  \n&gt;**Stab:** Well I really need this name changed. See it's the name of a skateboarding trick and my brother died in a skateboarding accident so it really bothers me to see my character with this name.  \n&gt;**Me:** That is unfortunate, but since the name doesn't break any rules we are not able to change it.  \n&gt;**Stab:** Okay. That was all then.  \n\n\nThis wasn't my first rodeo. I kept the account up a couple minutes and sure enough another ticket shows up so I grab it. This one says *\"Need to report a name to be changed\"* so maybe he just coincidentally saw a reportable name right after our chat.  \n\n\n&gt;**Me:** This is CSR WingAndTail again, I understand you have a name to report?  \n&gt;**Stab:** Yea, see my brother was named Stabi T Fakename and he was killed recently so I'd like my name changed. I cry every time I play now.  \n&gt;**Me:** The last name on your account is Lastname, not Fakename.  \n&gt;**Stab:** He was adopted!  \n&gt;**Me:** Regardless, the name doesn't violate our naming policies so we are unable to change it. Anything else I could assist you with Stabit?  \n&gt;**Stab:** No.  \n\n\nBy this point most people would give up, but if that had happened I wouldn't remember this story years later. Another ticket comes up for the account saying *\"Reporting a name\"* and I grab it.  \n\n\n&gt;**Me:** Hi Stabit, this is CSR WingAndTail. I understand you want to report a name?  \n&gt;**Stab:** Yea I found out my name is actually a curse word, you can check it on urban dictionary. I need it changed.  \n&gt;**Me:** Your name isn't a curse word, Stabit. Stabbing is a common attack and \"it\" is a pronoun.  \n&gt;**Stab:** It is a curse word in Italian! It's on urban dictionary!  \n&gt;**Me:** Stabit, your name doesn't break any rules and we will not be changing it. Is there anything else I can help you with?  \n&gt;**Stab:** Go away!  \n\n\nAs fun as this isn't, there are people with actual issues that we can do something for. So when another ticket comes down I grab it and have a quick chat with my supervisor.  \n\n\n&gt;**Me:** Hey Supervisor, this guy keeps making tickets asking for a name change for his character named Stabit.  \n&gt;**Supervisor:** How many tickets has he made?  \n&gt;**Me:** This is the fourth so far.  \n&gt;**Sup:** *sigh* Tell him we'll suspend him for staff harassment if he keeps it up.  \n&gt;**Me:** Can we do that?  \n&gt;**Sup:** Eh, yea. See if he makes a ticket after this one and we'll deal with it then.  \n\n\nHooray!  \n\n\n&gt;**Me:** Hey Stabit, it's CSR WingAndTail again. You have a name to report?  \n&gt;**Stab:** There is a pornstar in Russia named Stabit so my name is clearly pornographic and violates the rules.  \n&gt;**Me:** Stabit, your name does not violate any naming policy we have and will not be changed. We've told you this several times and if you continue to create tickets for this we will give your account a suspension for harassing our staff.  \n&gt;**Stab:** You're harassing me by not changing my name!  \n&gt;**Me:** Do you have any other issues to address, Stabit?  \n&gt;*He doesn't reply but I can see him running around in the game killing critters. After a few minutes of being ignored I close the ticket.*  \n\n\nHe didn't make any more tickets that I was aware of and a year later the ability to pay to change your name was implemented.",

I'm fairly new at the job, and the programs we use are a little wonky so I'm still getting used to the lay of the land as far as navigation and typing notes as I process calls. \n\nWell, I cried today. My last phone call of the day, I knew from the get-go it was gonna be a doozy.  Verification script must include the phone number we should have for them...it all went down hill from there. ...call goes:\n\nMe: okay what's a good phone number we should have on file for you? \n\nLady: ohhhhh my god the same one you've been calling. You have it. Blah blah\n\nMe: right well it just a part of the verification protocol that I ask you to make sure we're all on the same page and I'm speaking with the correct person...\n\n**Moving on....**\n\nMe: okay looks like you have x amount in your suspense account and you're current. How can I help you today? \n\nLady: UM I SHOULD NOT HAVE x IN MY SUSPENSE ACCT FIRST OF ALL, I SHOULD HAVE y. AND I WANTED IT APPLIED TO PRINCIPLE BALANCE ANYWAY. WHERE IS MY MONEY AND WHY WASNT IT APPLIED CORRECTLY?\n\nMe: *me clicking buttons and finding numbers and navigating pages to find the answer*\n\nLady: This was NOT a rhetorical question I am expecting an answer. \n\nMe: yes of course! well whoever processed your last payment did misapply the funds, however-\n\nLady:***interruption** well you don't have very bright people working there do you? Can YOU fix this or do I need to get ahold of someone who knows how to do their job right? Blah blah blah. You're new aren't you??? Do you know how to do your job? Blah blah \n\n***i am new, and I do know how to do my job. However, each new call has a new problem and a new solution. They are snowflakes.***\n\nWhatever, I ended up transferring the call to my super awesome supe because ended up putting Lady on hold and immediately started sobbing like a 2 year old who lost her ice cream cone. I could have finished the call if it weren't for me not being able to physically and coherently speak words. It was bad. I nearly threw myself into a panic attack over it. \n\nIt just got under my skin so badly that she was so rude to me. Excuse me, but when I have you on the line I am making you my #1 priority, don't make me regret it please. ",

I had an elderly woman call me sobbing that her doctor ignored her calls. She told me that she needed her medication or else she would start having her seizures. She kept sobbing that she would be suicidal if she didn't get her medication. The thing was.......her doctor had left for the weekend. All I could do was take a message. She told me that was Ok and thanked me for all that I could do. She just kept.......sobbing. \n\nCall me what you want; pussy, weak-ass, bitch.

        "text": "So, I've worked in various call centers for 7 years. I've tried to just stick to one place, hold my ground, kick ass, and move up, but my mental health status tends to screw me over. It just keeps hitting the same pattern. I burn out, my performance suffers, I'm not at risk of getting fired *yet* but I know that if I stick around for even a few more months, I will be. So I look for other jobs, can only find another damn call center, I move to that call center, and the cycle continues. It's OK for a while, because classroom training is SO much better than actually being on the phones. But the burnout just keeps coming faster. \n\nI left a medical call center where I dealt with trauma situations fairly frequently, because the pay was so low that, even with two roommates, I wasn't making ends meet and I was taking on debt. The new call center is lower stress, for the most part, but the schedule adherence standard is about 96 percent! I can't see myself making that. \n\nThe shit part is, it's a sales job and I'm actually doing pretty damn well. I'm at about 200 percent of the sales goal for someone at my tenure level. Last month I did even better, hitting 129 percent of *seasoned sales rep* goal for the month.\n\n EVERY stat except for schedule adherence is at the top of my training class. I took on the sales role to hopefully parlay that into an account manager position, either here or at a different company. I guess it's gonna be a different company.\n\nI'm still technically in training. We got out of the classroom about 2 and a half months ago. I've been here almost 5 months total. At the 6 month mark, if my schedule adherence isn't 96, I immediately will go into a \"performance improvement plan.\"\n\nFortunately, this time, instead of getting depressed, I've mostly gotten just angry that I'm still stuck here. With anger comes some actual energy. So I'm channeling that into applying for something like 20 jobs a day, even if it means I get a lot less sleep. I work second shift, so I can interview in the mornings. I have a meeting with a headhunter on Monday who is trying to match me with either account management, (which I've pretty amply demonstrated that I can do) or a non-clinical medical office assistant gig. If I go the medical route, I think I might plan to work toward a CMA cert, and if that goes well, physician assistant eventually. \n\nI originally majored in PR/marketing with intent to go into PR for a nonprofit, but then the recession happened. Call center in '08 was a stopgap to get some money flowing in until I could find something better. It then became a trap. I'll let ya know how the exit strategy goes. ",

I assess the power of the 'scope and tell him that he will be getting a map of the northern hemishphere with her particular star highlighted on it.  Then we go around and around with him asking me if her telescope is strong enough and if she will be able to find the star with it.  I tell Tex repeatedly that if his wife follows the instructions she should be able to find her star.  This goes on for far too long and he seems rather confused,  Finally; \"But are you sure we will get the right map?\" He asks.  \"Yes, You will be getting an accurate map of the northern hemisphere with your actual star's area circled on it sir.\"   To which he returned:\n\"But Ma'am, you don't understand.

I've called multiple times (As a supervisor I have access to our call records checked. This is the first time she has ever called our line) and no-one will help me.\n\nME: Okay, what seems to be the trouble? \n\nSA: I ordered a 3,000$ watch from your company and I never received it. I't taking too long and I don't want it anymore. Cancel the order and refund my money. \n\n*I pause for a moment thinking \"No-one was able to help you with this?\" Cancellations are the easiest things one of our agents can deal with. When we hire Newbies, this is the first thing we teach them since it's so easy to do, but since she say's it's 3,000 dollars It's entirely possible that it was sent to a supervisor to process.* \n\nME: I do apologize for that m'am. Please give me your order number and we'll get that cancelled and refunded right away. \n\n*I open the order in my system and I see that the order was shipped about two weeks ago via courier with a signature on the parcel. It was delivered a few days prior to the call and signed for with SA's signature. I explain that we have a signature and send the delivery confirmation to her email to confirm that it is her signature while on the phone.* \n\nSA: No, That's not my signature. \n\n*This is where the scam detector in my head begins to go off and I wave over my buddy in Fraud to come have a look.  My buddy advises me that this customer was flagged at the time of purchase and we have a copy of her driver's licence on file.\n\nI keep the customer busy while my buddy sends me a copy of the licence. Sure enough, when I get it, the signature is the same as the UPS signature on file.  I ask the customer to hold while I do a little more digging.\n\nWhen I find what I am looking for I pick up the call again. *\n\nMe: Hello SA? Thank you for holding. I'm afraid there is nothing I can do. Unfortunately there is a signature on this parcel so I am unable to file a claim since the product was delivered to the address specified at the time of purchase. \n\n*At this point SA loses her shit.*\n\nSA: I can't beleive what a load of shit your company is. You're all a bunch of scam artists. (Projection much?) I must have called 5 times (actually 1 counting today's call) I am going to call my credit card company and file a chargeback and I'm calling my lawyer (which is my favorite line).\n\nMe: Please feel free. Be sure to send them my contact information so I can send them these screenshots of your FaceBook profile. \n\nSA: (calming down and confused slightly) what?\n\nMe: I'm sure they'd love to see the photos you posted showing off the new 3,000$ watch that you say you never received, and never signed for.  I'm going to go ahead and close your account and flag your card for fraud, so you can't use it on our site again. Is there anything else I can help you with today? \n\nSA: no...\n\nME:Thank you calling Anonymous E-Store and have a great day!",

It sounds bleak but it's actually pretty nice.  \n\nOur story starts with a burglary alarm for Happy Park. It has the standard procedure for burglar alarms: call the location, then the police, then the contact list. If we talk to a person they have to have the codeword or we keep going down the list. We shall pretend the codeword is \"moose\".  \n\nStep One: call the location...  \n&gt;**Ranger Lady:** Happy Park Ranger Station.  \n&gt;**Me:** Hi, this is Alarm Company. We're showing a burglar alarm for storage shed alpha, do you know if everything is alright there?  \n&gt;**RL:** Yea, it's fine. It was the maintenance guy and we sent someone out to shut the alarm off already.  \n&gt;**Me:** Ok, could I get your name and codeword please?  \n&gt;**RL:** My name is Ranger Lady and the codeword is alpaca.  \n&gt;**Me:** That's not the codeword I have.  \n&gt;**RL:** Oh... is it lama? The number we punch in is 1234.  \n&gt;**Me:** It isn't those either. Is there anyone else there who might know it?  \n&gt;*Pause for chatter in the background.*  \n&gt;**RL:** It should be alpaca. We don't have any other codeword.  \n&gt;**Me:** Alrighty, thank you for your time then.  \n\nAt this point I believe Ranger Lady, but she didn't have the codeword so I carry on with the instructions. Called the police, we swap info, and then take a look at the contact list. There is one person on the contact list and we shall call him George.  \n\n&gt;**George:** This is Ranger George.  \n&gt;**Me:** This is Alarm Company, we're calling you as a contact for Happy Park.  \n&gt;**RG:** Yea, I was just at the shed helping the maintenance guy and I got a radio from the police to head back.  \n&gt;**Me:** That'd be why we are calling. Do you know the codeword so we can cancel that dispatch?  \n&gt;**RG:** It should be alpaca but I think someone changed it and didn't tell us the new one.  \n&gt;**Me:** It isn't alpaca and I can't give any hints I'm afraid.  \n&gt;**RG:** Alright well I'll make some calls after this and see if we can get it figured out.  \n\nAnd with no more contacts on the list my job is done. It was either the craftiest criminal enterprise for stealing from some shed in some park or a fine example of bureaucratic gear grinding.  ",

I'm doing well, the jobs easy if not for some customers. I've picked up some of sup Ken's demeanor but since im just an agent i cant really let it out very often.\n\nThis next guy was one of the exceptions and the epitome of telephone tough guy (TTG), Loud, crude, ignorant and racist.....and according to the discount on his line he was in the navy (not knocking the military but this is kinda pertinent).\n\nI dont remember the entirety of the conversation but this the gist of it. Im not sure this subs take on racial slurs or if you need a trigger warning for it but take this as your warning.\n\n.\n\nMe: The reason you bill is high and you were sent to collections is that there were additional charges for 411 as well as some other 3rd party calls (think phone sex lines/hook up lines before online dating i.e. #sex) totaling $450 and we havent received a payment in the past 6 months\n\nTTG: Well i didnt make no 411 or 3rd party calls, im not paying those, i was on deployment for the past 6 months.\n\nMe: Well that would explain the non-payment, if you had called prior we could have placed your line on military suspension. Do you have your deployment papers? We can try and apply it retroactively for the monthly charges since i see no usage but the 411 and #sex were prior to that and definitely came from your device.\n\nTTG: Bitch, my black ass has been in Iraq keeping your bitch ass safe for the past 6 months. Imma come back and your going to tell me your charging me $850? What kind of fucking american are you? \n\nMe: North (im not from/in the USA)\n\nTTG: What?\n\nMe: Well Im a North American\n\nTTG: You a fucking spic?\n\nMe: Sorry, what? (that alone should give away where i am)\n\nTTG: Just fucking great, im gone for 6 months and the fucking mexicans take over\n\nMe: I'm not mexican, sir\n\nTTG: Mexican, Cuban, what ever type of fucking illegal you are\n\nMe *(ignoring the racism because its just not worth the fight yet)*: No sir, think hockey and igloos not soccer and haciendas\n\nTTG: What? Whatever man, im not paying this bill now cut my phone on.\n\nMe: Well sir at this point the only thing that can \"cut your phone on\" is a payment of $850 for the full past due since you are well past the 6 month dispute time frame for those calls and we do not have record of your deployment.\n\nTTG: Listen hear you little cocksucker, im a navy seal you hear me. Imma come find you, you wont ever hear me coming and then im gonna slit your fucking thoat ear to fuckin ear you hear me. Now where the fuck are you located?\n\nMe: Sir at this point im going to have to ask.....Wait....Did you just threaten my life **then** ask me where i am located? \n\nTTG: ....what?\n\nMe: Ya.....and thinking on that, you just threatened my life over not just state lines but international ones.....thats a felony isnt it? Doesn't that mean the the FBI gets involved? *(completely bullshitting but it sounds good)* \n\nTTG: ...\n\nMe: And since you're active duty military doesn't that mean Leavenworth for you or something?\n\nTTG: **click**",

        "text": "I've read almost every story here and decided to start sharing! (Sorry if formatting is wrong)\n\nSo I started at this call center July last year, I'm still there just in a different (and less stressful) department. I originally started out doing roadside assistance. We are an independent center, contracted by a large US auto insurance carrier, who happens to also service an automotive manufacturer for their roadside. We work as the middle person in setting up tows/lockouts/etc. Anyways onto the story.\n\nThe call came in, and my the whisper in my headset stated it was a 2nd-time call in (or recall as we called it) meaning, service was setup but either the tow guy didn't show, or they don't need service, or need an update. So I answer as normal and verify the information, and the customer states she has been stuck on the highway for quiet some time and really needs help (forget exactly what was wrong but she needed a tow to a dealership about 30~ miles away which also happen to be across state lines).\n\nThe thing about our contract with the tow companies, we accept up to 60 min ETAs, and 90 in desperate times. We have an escalation team that can get better times and can pay more if needed. She was given a 60 min ETA, but if you are stuck on the interstate 60 minutes can seem like forever. Luckily most providers make it there quicker.\n\nI call the SP (service provider) and they said sorry their driver was busy/not answering/can't come help with that job find another company. Again this happens all the time, but is really shitty since she may wait another hour. I rely the information and it goes something like this:\n\n&gt;Cust: I told the girl before you I am elderly and handicapped so I am literally stuck in my car\n\n&gt;Me: I understand this situation is terrible and I am working on finding another provider to pick you up\n\n&gt;Cust: And I also told that girl before that I really needed to use the restroom, and I've gone in my pants.\n\nMy heart sunk at that point. I put her on hold to find another SP, but instead of started dialing I went to a team nearby (who I really didn't care for, she was a hard-ass and rarely was helpful but no others were available) and explain the situation:\n\n&gt;Me: So this older lady, who is handicapped as well, is stuck on the highway, SP cancelled, she been waiting an hour already, she is panicking and went to the restroom in her pants. Can I escalate this and hope they can get a decent ETA?\n\n&gt;TL: No we will handle this, escalations is busy right now, but we will get less then 60min ETA. Offer more cash if you need too\n\nI was surprised but the TL sat next to me and I started dialing, and generally our script to SP is \"This is donkstin from X roadside, we have a Y customer in need of a row, what is your best ETA?\", if they say 60min I can accept, but my TL gave me orders to ask for 30min or less, for extra money.\n\nNone of the providers took the extra, they were too \"busy\" to get someone out there in that time frame, or they didn't cover that area, or didn't want to cross state lines. I'm starting to freak out, I've been on this call for a while, meaning the customer has been waiting even longer. My TL instructs me to out of our contracted providers to just google towing near her location. When we do this (escalations typically does this), they charge whatever they want, and it's job to find a fair price. \n\nI go out of network, find someone with 60minutes, they cant do it any sooner, and I have literally no other companies nearby to call. We end up paying them $175 to tow the vehicle for that 60. \n\nThe customer disconnected during the process, to be fair I had her on hold longer I should have. I called her back after finalizing the payment with the SP, got her voicemail, left a message detailing who and when they would be there and apologizing. Then as I wrap up to term out of the call another agent walked up looking for me:\n\n&gt;Agent: Are you donkstin?\n\n&gt;Me: Yes, what's up?\n\n&gt;Agent: I have that lady who was stuck on the highway, she called back in, what's going on with the call I didn't see any notes\n\n&gt;Me: Oh I just termed out, I got Z Company for 60 min ETA. I left her a voicemail\n\n&gt;Agent: Oh I have to tell her it's going to be another hour? She went to the bathroom in her pants!\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah she told me too, me and TL tried to get a decent time but we couldn't\n\n&gt;Agent: I am far too pregnant for this. I guess I'll break the bad news.\n\nAnd I hadn't heard anything else about it. I really hope she made it to the dealership to get her car fixed and I hope everything worked out for her. I will never forget that call.",

        "text": "So, i have a story to this, but before that i would like you to read the following example and think about your own answer first, as i don't want you to be affected by my opinion.\n\nExample:\n\nCustomer did not receive her parcel, it came back to us and we refunded it already. But the customer wants to know why it came back. You confirm that the shipping address was correct. It's also possible to track the parcel, so you look if you can find an information there, but it does not help. The reason is really general. So what do you do? Do you call the delivery company or do you tell the customer to call?\n\n\n\nNow to my own story:\n\nI told the customer to call, which might have been wrong, but there were also other things that annoyed me about this call.\n\nLet's start:\n\nCustomer calls. I say my first name. She asks for my full name. This is always the first red flag for me. \nSo she asks about her parcel. It happened as in the example above. Came back and already refunded.\nBut, another thing, she was told a wrong price. Funnily enough, we confirm price and points you get for an order. The price she was told was around the amount of the points.\n\nSo i told her my collegaue might mixed it up. She maybe meant the points. Customer goes yeah she said something about points.\nAnd this is where i thought: My collegaue probably confirmed it right, but she did not listen properly and confuse it herself.\n\nAlso she asks if i can send it to a packing station. I say yes and she provides the address. But, there is a misunderstaning. She thought i could just take her address and send it to any \npacking station around there. I tell her that i need a number. And i could not just search for a packing station there. \n\nShe is saying you guys make this really complicated. And also customer called the delivery company in the end. But she thought we would have to do this. Also asked for the phone number of the delivery company. Which i took from the homepage, as i don't know their number.\n\nSo why did i think, she should call? Well, we were not really trained to make calls to other companies. I am sure we would have been if we had to.\n\nIn terms of resends and refunds, we are a pretty generous company. I offered her to resend as well. But she wanted to know why she did not receive it. How would i know? We confirmed the address after all and it was correct. The parcel was not lost either, it just came back. So all i can see is the information on the tracking. I can't say more, after all i was not the one who delivered it and decided it can't be delivered. This decision was made by the delivery company, so of course they would know.\n\nBut maybe i am wrong about this, shortly before the end of my shift, i did not want to be stuck on a long call, though this is not the reason why i made the decision as above\n",

        "text": "So.. I've been back 4 days so far (MWF schedule so far) and already this place is reasserting itself as the clownfiesta I once knew. Before I went off again in September last year, I applied for flexible working, for a 20 hours schedule based around my uni work. I never got word back on it, but resource and planning scheduled me for it in the interim while it was officially negotiated since they left it so late that my university course actually started while they delayed. So.. when I was negotiating my phased return, and told I could only come back on 50%/75%/100% weeks 1/2/3+, I initially thought \"Okay, 10/15/20 hours isn't bad anyway\", only to be told that HR and management had \"no record\" of my schedule change. Or rather, \"We have no record of the scheduling or 20 hour contract, other than resource and planning having you on a 20 hour schedule for 2 weeks\". And with that, I was rather backed into a corner to accept a return to 37.5 hours, at least temporarily..\n\nNow, having checked my accrued holidays, it appears from September onwards, I accrued holidays as though on a 20 hour contract, and when scheduling my shifts for this week at 75%, resource and planning have given me 15 hours (which management immediately said they'd \"fix\" on Monday, they still haven't...), but HR and management are still adamant that I'm on a 37.5 hour contract. I'm seriously tempted at this point to get that in writing, and accept it officially, purely to turn around on them and inquire when I'll be paid my extra 120 hours of holiday that I should have accrued in the meantime.\n\nOh, and to cap it all off, on multiple internal systems I'm still \"sick\".\n\nTLDR: When negotiating a phased return, ensure that HR doesn't plan on the MMO definition of phasing, or 5 people will be talking to 5 versions of you.",

I put my resume on the states unemployment website and I got a call within one day from a a bank asked me about applying to work at a call center.\n\nBeen to a few job fairs and been applying left and right. All I have gotten back are shady scam sales jobs (to include commission based sales) and now trying temp agencies/staffing firms. Not too hopeful but I need to get back to work. Applied for a 911 job with the city, wasn't picked up for that. Hopefully a light at the end of the tunnel.",

Never posted here before, but here we go.  \n\nAbout a six months into my career as a call center agent, I started to have a real appreciation for people who took Spanish in college.  I had years of semi-forgotten French under my belt, and had never once been able to help a foreign customer muddle through their claim.  Imagine my delight after months of working calls from Texas and having to explain that while yes, I did have a hispanic last name (through marriage), no habla espanol, I FINALLY got a call from a French speaking woman.  \n\nMe: (still in English because she was doing pretty well) I'd be happy to review your loss, ma'am, it'll be just one moment!\n\nHer, in a mixture of French and English: I need to know what to do with my car title.  I'm  so upset!\n\nMe: I certainly understand!  It'll be one moment while I review\n\nAnd then she started speaking French in the background.  And I listened, poised to answer her in French.  \n\nHer: (in French) This little idiot doesn't know what she's doing either.  I keep having to call back!  Stupid bitch.  \n\nOh no you didn't, long awaited French caller.  \n\nSo I put on my sweetest, most over-the-top south Georgia accent, and said, \"Ah'm so sorry, ma'am, but ah don't speak SPANISH.\"\n\nCue sound of incoherent rage and a disconnected call.  My cackle of laughter could probably be heard on the next floor. ",

She says this over and over again like 10 times in the most desperate tone of voice lol\n\nMe: Okay! *Puts on hold for 10 secs to initiate transfer and she hangs up right before I could select transfer*\n\n---\n\nIt's bad enough having constant horrible customers, but it makes it so much worst when management could give a shit less about your equipment or providing you tools to do your job.",

        "text": "I used to work in a call centre for a mobile phone repair centre and we were one of the official repair centres for several manufacturers and high street chains. We worked for (technically below) minimum wage Mon-Sun, working unsocialble hours, far from the city centre where we boiled in the summer, and often sat shivering on a Sunday morning in winter. So after finding this sub, I thought I would share some of my memories.\n\n\n**How to make enemies and alienate people:**\n\nAs said in the introduction, we also worked weekends. Every weekend, unless you booked the whole weekend off about 2 months in advance. After an event that left a lot of our jobs uncertain, 9 people walked out on the same day to head for another start-up company, so we were quite understaffed. We were then hauled into a meeting in groups where we were given a speech by one of the higher up managers, the sort you have heard of but never see. After giving us an overview of the staff situation, and saying that he knows we were already working most weekends, and it was appreciated, we would be having to work more double weekends as that was our busiest time, don't let management down, etc. He then concluded by saying \"you know that I am serious as I do not give up my Saturdays lightly to come into work when I should be with my family.\" Thanks, Mr Manager, we will think of your sacrifice this one week on every double weekend we work.\n\n\n** The time one of our clients left and how we found out **\n\nOne of my colleagues took a call on one of our more long standing and reliable channels. It was another European centre who were calling for an update on the repair because the customer was on the line with them and were unable to transfer them to us. Turns out they called the European call centre instead of us because the channel was leaving us and switching to them. And that is how we (and management) found out we had lost the contract.\n\n\n**Sigh, customers..**\n\nA customer sent their phone into us, which was the flagship at the time, so usually cost over £400 and at least £45 a month on contract. As the screen was was damaged, she was charged over £100 to fix it as it was outside the warranty. She then called up 9 MONTHS LATER to tell us that she had received it back with the screen still damaged. This was the first call she had made to us about this. After double checking this was the only repair she had had and I was definately looking at the right job, she flew off the handle when I advised that if she sent in it again we would have to charge her. Apparently our 30 day rule for letting us know about repairs gone wrong was \"unacceptable\" (and I hadn't even told her it was 14 days for transit damage). Her mother came on the phone and started shouting at me too, and how her daughter wasn't a liar, they had just been very, very busy for 9 months and hadn't had time to call. As we were \"refusing to do the work that has been paid for\" they were going to report us to trading standards.\n\nYep, 1 month to report a still broken, very expensive phone after an expensive repair was not long enough.",

Please fix this\n\n*oh boy, this is going to go down badly, this business has provided us with literally 0 information on how to access WiFi. I'll have go Google-Fu this one*\n\n**Me**: Sir, can you please confirm what happens exactly when you connect?\n\n**Idiot**: No the WiFi isn't working. Come and fix it!\n\n*huh okay, guess I won't need to try and help you after all asshole*\n\n**Me**: Sir, I'm based completely off location, this is the out of hours desk. There's nobody on site that can come and help you right now, it's late on a Friday night. If you could explain the problem I should be able to help?\n\n*I open up Google and expect to hear some fairly basic issue*\n\n**Idiot**: I'm not explaining anything and you better get someone down here to get us access to the internet. We've been here for 5 days now and have had NO ACCESS since we got here. This is absolutely URGENT and CRITICAL!\n\n**Me**: Sir, have you contacted the actual service desk during business hours over the last few days?\n\n**Idiot**: NO\n\n**Me**: ....\n\n**Idiot**: HELLO! ARE YOU SENDING SOMEONE?\n\n**Me**: Sir, please give me xyz and I will log a ticket with the main desk to handle during business hours. I apologise for the frustration but we have nobody on site at the moment and I'm unsure why nobody has raised a call over the last 4 days if this is urgent?\n\n**Idiot**: WE ARE BUSY PEOPLE. We need WiFi for our project. We need someone here RIGHT NOW, OKAY? RIGHT NOW!\n\n*For those reading, we do have escalation contacts for emergencies, I check our process and this definitely does NOT qualify*\n\n**Me**: Sir, I will raise a call with the desk to handle during business hours. I apologise, however I have checked our process and we have no prior communication that this is an urgent project and as I mentioned before, no calls have been raised for 4 days so far so it's hard to justify an escalation to the on call engineer.\n\n**Idiot**: YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM MANAGEMENT ABOUT THIS!\n\nI check the ticket a few days later - their \"project\" was essentially them trying to connect a single iPad to the WiFi to access unrelated work websites and circumvent blocks on the main PC's.\n\nSo much for \"Critical\" and \"Urgent\"!\n\n",

        "text": "Hi, fellow Redditors! This is my first post so bear with me!\nI worked 9 months in a call center and praying not to go back. Currently testing video games &amp; starting college.. It gets better, guys!\n\n\nAnyways, a few months after I was hired at a call center for a wireless service provider, I've had this marvelous call that ruined my day initially. Keep in mind i was working technical support.\nConversation is a little fuzzy in my mind but it went something like so.. \n\n\nThis guy had an issue with his internet on his smartphone, it never worked. I was being polite &amp; nice as always, but in a relaxed way, not robotic call center voice-type. Turns out he activated his internet service at a retail location but the rep there didn't punch in the settings required for it to work (access point name &amp; all that jazz).\n\n\nSo i tell him where to go so we can fix it. Now keep in mind that I was saying \"Ok so for APN (access point name) you need to put in xxx.yyy.zzz\" and went like that for all settings. He interrupted me continuously saying he can't understand. I tried to explain him what they mean but the guy was just a complete tool &amp; had not technical knowledge, but didn't want to follow my directions either. So what did he decide to do?\n\n*Berate me, obviously.*\n\nHe started saying that my English is bad &amp; I can't speak it. Kept insisting that he needs to speak to a Canadian. (call center was, conveniently, located in Canada). Now, mind you, I have a little bit of accent. I'm from Eastern Europe &amp; speak my native language, German, English &amp; lately struggle with French - so my accent was a scramble, but my English was fine (passed Academic level IELTS - English International test).\nSo naturally, I was very irritated &amp; insulted because he wasn't right. I told him \"well, Sir... uh.. I'm speaking in English with you &amp; I'm doing it very clearly\" in a slightly sarcastic tone. He started saying \"don't get all sassy with me\" &amp; demanded a supervisor. I was happy to transfer him, really.\n\n\nFast forward 30 minutes, went to my (really nice) supervisor (British, so exceptional English) to ask what happened &amp; he had to re-explain the customer exactly what I just said, the guy was simply a jackass, not our fault.\nEven if that made me feel better 'cause it wasn't my fault, that guy ruined my day.\n\n\nFast forward 3-4 hours.. I get a call. I recognize the voice. And the name. Shit, I was thinking, not this guy again. My heart was pounding already. Well, he recognized me too.. And to my utmost surprise, he APOLOGIZED. I was blown away. He said it wasn't my fault, he just had a bad day at work, blah blah..\nSo i solve his billing issue &amp; the call ends.\n\n\nFast forward another hour, I get a call.. Same guy. It was getting freaky already. We ended up chatting about some city he wanted to visit, the weather.. (I was just being polite, you can't really turn them away)\n\n\nHe then dropped the bomb: \"Hey, I know this is weird, but.. can you tell me where you live? I wanna visit you. Also, are you married? Will you marry me?\"\n\n\nI was *petrified*. I told him I'm married, which lead to a dead awkward silence for a few seconds. He apologized &amp; ended the call quickly.\n",

Another time went home on her lunch perfectly fine and instead of returning, phoned in saying she had come down with something IN 45 MINUTES!) so she would not likely get through the application process. \n\nShe was also told she might not enjoy working here as everyone hated how she treated them during her last week.

        "text": "So ive worked in call centers from the early 00s till a few years ago in almost every lower level position from agent, sup, QA, WFM, help desk and ops manager and over 8 different clients. I'm now out of the field entirely and into public service (oddly i found its really the same thing) I've seen every level of stupidity imaginable from every level of the corporate world and sometimes even government. I dont know how much ill post but i figure i can at least add a little in return from all my time lurking here.\n\n.\n\nI was working for a US mobile telcomm in the early 00s which had the best cs rating in the US when they merged with a much larger telcomm which coincidentally had the worst customer service ranking in the US. This is my first month and Guy calls in because of high bill\n\nGuy: My bill is too high you need to fix it\n\nMe: ok let me have a look at whats the cause\n\n*pull up bill, do a double take, guy has over $8000 in text messaging charges from 2 months and he has no texting plan*\n\nMe: ok well you have quite a lot of texting being used in the last 2 months, increasing every month and without a plan, we really need to get you on a unlimited plan and ill look at adjusting these charges.\n\nGuy: Ya Thats my daughters phone im not adding a plan, you just need to get rid of the charges.\n\nMe: Well we can't just remove the charges, the services were used but i can definitely work with you if we make sure it doesnt keep happening.\n\nGuy: Nope just remove them now\n\nMe: Unfortunately thats not going to be an opt-\n\nGuy: remove then charges\n\nMe: i dont thi-\n\nGuy: just remove the charges, just remove the charges, just remove then charges, ...\n\nMe: ok well i'll have to check with my support as my limit is no where near $8000, please hold.\n\n*looking in account, guy did this same song and dance 3 months ago, they credited the guy $12000 for the previous 6 months and told him no more credits because he refused to add a plan and was EXCEEDINGLY abusive about it, threats against the agents life were documented.*\n\nMe: Thank you for holding, i reviewed your account and i see you were advised 3 months ago we would not -\n\nGuy: just remove the charges\n\nMe: Sorry thats not going to be an option\n\nGuy: just remove the charges, remove the charges, remove the charges, remove the charges, remove the charges, remove the charges........\n\nMe: Please hold *go get supervisor Ken*\n\nSUP Ken is awesome, extremely professional, never gets flustered, will do everything to help a customer but takes no shit and will cancel your account, charge cancellation fees and fuck up your credit, legitimately i might add, if you're an absolute ass. Im listening in on the call as this is a \"teachable moment\" about de-escalation\n\nKen: Hi this is supervisor ken how -\n\nGuy: just remove the charges\n\nKen: Yes i understand you are calling abou-\n\nGuy: just remove the charges\n\nKen: Well sir we are not going to be removing any charges unless we can actually discuss the texting issue\n\nGuy: Just. Remove. The. Charges\n\nKen: That is not an option we are exploring you used the service and knew from the last time this happened we wouldnt credit the charges\n\nGuy: Well you can go fuck yourself, fuck your mother, your dog and fuck that agent as well right up the ass as im not paying shit.\n\nKen: Well that is your option sir but as of right now your service will be cut off in 2 days for non-payment and after (i forget how long) the account will be cancelled and sent to collections which will effect your credit.\n\nGuy: Well you can still go fuck yourself you ignorant cunt and im going to come find your ass and shoot your fucking face.\n\nKen: Ok sir just to remind you this call is recorded and i expec-\n\nGuy: I dont fucking care what the fuck you going to do you little bitch, I know you're located in *my city*, imma come put a fucking slug in your brain and fuck the hole.\n\nKen: well with that sir i am letting you know that as of 15min from now your 5 lines with us are now cut off, $250 per line is being charged for termination fees as they are all under contract, a block is being placed on reactivation pending investigation and we are referring you to your local PD for threats against me and my employee.\n\nGuy: You motherfu-\n\nKen: goodbye sir *click*\n\nI got to spend the rest of shift filling out paperwork and signing a statement, apparently the teachable moment was the customer is not always right and there are repercussions for them being extreme assholes.",

        "text": "So late last year, I was let go from my previous CC employer of 10 years (security company)(and yeah I know, needed to get out MUCH SOONER, but lacked the motivation and confidence).  I couldn't take it anymore.  It changed me for the negative, and still am working on getting my life motivation and confidence back. When I was with them, I had to adhere to a 97% compliance rating in my metrics or face corrective action.  Couldn't use personal time to go to the bathroom outside of my scheduled breaks or face corrective action.  Multiple Large LED TV's within view from my desk flashing CODE RED: ALL HANDS ON DECK (which ironically excluded management) became something I saw on a daily basis.  No breather in between calls, it was back to back to back to back to back to back to BACK until break arrived (if you could even take it on time due to prolonged calls).  Management went from \"We want to get you up to make more money\" to not even acknowledging my presence as a human being.  I was told many times they wanted to promote me, but because my metrics were down by literally .05% than someone else at the time, I was denied.  I went for a mentoring role which helped me get off the phones, but turns out they wanted more of a watchdog to make sure people were staying in Auto'd In status rather than someone knowledgeable to help my coworkers out with technical issues.  I was asked to help out with an upcoming training class because of my expertise, which turned into me actually BEING THE TRAINER while she was off on vacation for 2 weeks.  I received rave reviews from both the class and upper management, out-shined the person who was the actual trainer, but was never given a similar opportunity and was instead directed back to the phones.\n\nOnce the breaking point hit a few years later, I called management out on the inefficiency and utter insanity of the organization, and for that I was let go.  I freaked out and broke down at first, because I was living on my own and had bills to pay, and ABSO-LUTELY would not even consider moving back with my psychotic parents (my brother and his kid were already there so there was literally no room for me).  Then I was able to score another job within a month, another CC, and with $2/hr lower pay.  I took it as I needed something immediately to avoid getting evicted. Things were going well through training, but once we hit the floor and saw and learned about how things REALLY work at the place, de ja vu was running rampant around my brain, and I already know how its going to go here.  Myself and 1 other previous classmate are the only ones on my current managers team that have not been given an opportunity for uptraining like everyone else, and my metrics are not the reason for this as I am meeting expectations.  I've asked about uptraining opportunities, but all I have been told so far is \"We'll let you know when the next uptraining class is.\" I'm sitting here twiddling my thumbsticks with 15-25 minutes of downtime between each call. For the sake of my well being, my mental sanity, and my future, I HAVE TO GET OUT!\n\nHow I was able to survive the CC environment that long?  Guess you could say I have a stronger mind than most, that and the money to live on my own, but I'm still on the verge of a breaking point again.  I NEED to get out, but with a lack of current belief in myself and my abilities from being abused at the previous place, I really don't know how to get something better with the very limited skill set I have acquired for the past 11 years.\n\nThose of you that found the light at the end of the tunnel, how do I do it?",

        "text": "I need to rant to someone about this, and I figured if anyone would understand, it'd be you guys. \n\nI moved to a different state about a year and a half ago, and in that time it's only been my SO working. We get by, but I wanted more money so we can start saving up money and live more comfortably. \n\nSO works for a major cell phone company CC in their retention department. I've worked for CCs for about 5 years (off and on) so I figured why not try there. It pays the best in my area, starting out just shy of $14/hr plus bonuses, SO makes $16/hr plus bonuses. (And pretty great benefits too, actually.) I got hired and I start training on Monday. \n\nI still have a week to go before I start, but I'm already having anxiety about working the phones again. They wanted to put me in Retention (their Tier 2, at higher pay) because I did well on my interview and assessments, but I know I would quit that job after a week on the phones, so I asked to be placed in the general CSR department. \n\nMy SO says that this company is the best CC he's ever worked for, and he's worked for a lot of them, but I'm still a bit panicky about it. His boss is a nightmare! Her BF got fired because he was purposefully editing SO's metrics so he wouldn't bonus, and got busted and fired, and now she's gunning for him to get fired. She listens to every single call he takes every day and will coach him on anything she can possibly think of, just to change her mind later that day to try and trip him up. His teammates haven't had a coaching or even heard from her in over a week. He got transferred out of her team after complaining to HR, but his boss' boss moved him back there because she's BFFs with NightmareBoss. Yeah, I'm getting worried. He's constantly saying he wishes he never got promoted to his department, mostly because of his boss, but he also gets yelled at all day every day because he's in retention... but he says I won't have to deal with any of that because I'll be in CSR1. He loved his job and bosses back when he was CSR1, but I'm still worried.\n\nThis company's call center has a good rep for being the most fun you can have while still being at a call center, and I'm just praying it's not just hype. I am great on the phones, and I have never had an issue meeting my metrics and making goal. It's just that every single call center I've worked at the management's been awful, and they treat you like garbage. I'm hoping that the reason for that is because I worked in a Right-To-Work state, which I don't anymore. My SO keeps assuring me that everyone is really nice, he's just unlucky that he got put on NightmareBoss's team because of the circumstances. But he loved all of his other bosses and teammates. \n\nI don't know, I'm just dreading it already, and my old anxiety is setting in. Do you guys have any tips that you could pass on to me? I don't want to sabotage myself before I even get in there, but I'm having a hard time not fussing over it. \n\n**Edited to add:** \n\nI've worked as a CSR for DerpTV and Crapcast and for CenturyCrap, but never a pink cell phone company. If someone's worked both, I'd love a comparison. I'm hoping nothing can be worse than working for DerpTV, right?\n",

Give me the number verbally with your voice please.\n\n-sorry there's no listing for that\n\nthen she just spells me the name, and when I confirm that is the spelling I used, she interrupts me and starts spelling again, only louder.

Verbally please?\n\n-Well I only have initials, no full name. I have A Gotlieb, C Gotlieb, H Gotlieb, etc.\n\n-What do you have under A? Verbally please, on what street?\n\nAt this point I'm just forcing myself to stay calm with all her \"Verbally\", I fucking get it, please stop saying that\n\n-A Gotlieb is on [street], do you want this number?\n\n-Yes please give it to me verbally. Verbally with your voice, verbally!\n\n-[*This is my chance*] Thank you, hold the line for the number, have a nice day!\n\nAnd I press the button sending her to the automated system she so hates.\n\nI got her once more after that, she was even more insistent on the \"verbally\" which I obviously didn't comply to. \n\nToo bad I didn't get her again, I had a plan to actually give her the number verbally, but saying \"verbally\" between each digit just to show her how annoying she is.

        "text": "I just started work at an outsourced call centre; I handle service and billing issues on behalf of a UK telecommunication provider.\n\nA gentleman called today who had recently had issues with his direct debit. There had been some sort of kerfluffle with his bank, and apparently he had somehow managed to get two direct debits to our client. After talking to four of our agents, he managed to go into the bank and supposedly get it sorted. The bank said they cancelled one of those direct debits and allegedly now had just one DD for our client.\n\nSo he calls me up to make sure this is all sorted. He gives me the complete spiel about talking to four agents and spending hours in the bank, and makes sure to tell me the reference number the bank gave him (which is meaningless to us, since we have no access to that kind of thing). After verification, I fire up the billing programme and see there is no DD set up. I explain this to him, and in the middle, he interrupts me, tells me I'm wrong and there is a DD, and gives me his complete story again.\n\nI apologise, saying it's a glitch on our part, but I will fix it now. He gives me his story again, getting progressively angrier and more frustrated, and insisting I use the reference number from the bank. I apologise again, and try to talk this down, saying there is a slight issue owing to his recent bank problems, but I can fix it right there and then.\n\n(Note: Yes, fixing it means setting up a DD, since there is none, but I have been careful not to say I'll be setting up anything new. I've just been telling him I can fix the issue he's having).\n\nYer man is having none of it. He orders me to get this right, reels off his story yet again, and orders me to fix it. I explain that's what I'm trying to do, and he yells his story yet another time, complete with emphasis on the reference number from the bank. By now he has added another sentence, saying he will not give me his account because the (useless) reference number is all I need. (I have not yet asked for his account number). Can you guess why he had to talk to so many people?\n\nHe now declares that I don't know what I'm doing and demands to be sent to the department that can help me. I explain that I am that department and this is one of my responsibilities (since I have done precisely this many times). I can solve the problem here and now, in just a couple of minutes, if he will let me help him. Out comes the story once again. At this point I am literally begging him to let me help him, so much so that one of my team leaders pats me on the back and asks me if I'm OK. (This isn't as impressive as it sounds, since my team leaders are sound fellas who care about our well-being, but it's still not something I've ever seen him do).\n\nThis goes on for a few more minutes, and I'm sure my AHT for the day is shot. I keep begging him to let me fix this minor error for him, but he refuses, repeating his story literally literally every time I ask any sort of question, and at one point telling me to call the bank and quote the reference number if I can't use it myself. (Yeah, I'm sure we can do that kind of double DPA violation). Yes, I raised my voice a few times, mostly after he told me his story and interrupted me as soon as I started to speak again to repeat it yet another tiem. After some back and forth of this nature, he gets fed up at my inability to help him without his permission and decides he wants to cancel the account.\n\nI apologise for failing to provide the level of service that $telecommunications_company strives for, and I can close his account if that's what he really wants. Lo and behold, out comes the story yet again. I ask again does he want to cancel his account or fix his DD issue. The story is repeated. I ask again, saying I can do either, but he has to choose one. He repeats his story, exasperated. I ask once again - does he want to cancel his account, or does he want to continue and fix the DD issue. \n\nNo answer. \n\nI ask three times if there is anyone on the other end, and get only silence. In accordance with dropped call protocol, I terminate the call.\n\nOur call centre has a personal break mode. This is used if we need to take a few minutes to calm down. We are allocated 10 minutes of this every day, and some of my teammates make sure to always use it, but I never did until today (well, technically yesterday now). I just had to step outside and scream \"FUCK THAT FUCKING FUCKER\". Then I used some more time to fill in the notes before going back into ready mode.\n\nOne other thing which will add clarity, but I'm saving it for the end so as not to colour perceptions. This gentleman was Pakistani, and he actually spoke fine English, but it clearly wasn't his first language. I suspect that he sat down and worked out a speech to give to agents which would get across all the information he thought would be necessary, and when things didn't go as he expected, he simply repeated the speech in case I had missed something. I feel bad for him because his situation sucks and he's just trying to get by, but seriously dude, let people fix problems.",

You phone people and offer them a product to buy. Or you offer them some magazine subscription, better banking account, internet contract, etc.  \nYou know what I mean?  \nDoes anyone work like this?  \nI'm pretty shy person. Lately I've been depressed, meds help me a little.  \nAnd since most job offers in my area are those call centers, I think about trying to work there.  \nDo you think it will make me less shy and I will have easier to talk to people (including those I already know).  \nOr it'll make it worse and I will be more shy to talk to people?  \nEh...  \nI've worked a few jobs before, but all of them were \"dirty\" jobs.

        "text": "So I'm new here, and I just want to say thank god for this thread. It's weirdly comforting to know I'm not the only one that has to endure all this stupid shit, day in day out.\n\nI'm 6 months into my job at a credit card call centre. Mostly dealing with fees, interest, refunds, issuing and stopping of cards etc...\n\nTraining was great; mostly classroom based, which was nice. But now I'm on the phones, I regret ever taking this job (which I only really did cause it was way better money than what I was earning previously). First, the customers are insane. I've been yelled at, sworn at and threatened countless times. They don't seem to realise that despite the fact they can't see me, I'm an actual person.\n\nSecond, my company has a massive emphasis on the \"team\" environment. They expect you to be best friends with everyone on your team, and actively participate in group discussions and team activities, even if they're scheduled outside of work. I'll be honest, social environments are not my strong suit and never have been and this focus on forced interaction is making it worse (to the point where I now have to see a therapist for the first time in years). In my last performance review I was made to promise to eat lunch with my \"teammates\" at least 2 times a week in order to demonstrate my effort ... Still haven't done it though. I just don't get how this is indicative of job performance... I can do my job without being social.\n\nMy manager is like Jekyll and Hyde; fine one minute, insane and hypercritical the next. We have weekly sessions where we meet with the manager individually and assess the last weeks performance... And no matter how good my stats are, there's only ever negative feedback, mostly about how I don't make a \"connection\" with the client (I.e small talk etc...). I'm always polite and do what I can to help them, and I just don't see how small talk is necessary.  I've heard and seen some of my teammates meetings, and theirs are largely positive.  The constant criticism is grating and is seriously wreaking havoc on my nerves and mind.\n\nIn all honesty, I know this job is bad for my health (especially mental), but I can't leave because I need the money and there are next to no jobs in the town I live in (I have a bachelors and masters degree but still can't find a suitable job... Ah, post grad life). It's gotten to the point now where I have to actively focus on not crying on the way to work of a morning, before having to spend 10 minutes before each shift trying to come down from a panic attack (which are now daily occurrences).\n\n\ntldr: hate this job, boss is overly critical with nothing nice or encouraging to say, weird and uncomfortable emphasis on teamwork = worsening anxiety and daily panic attacks.\n\nAny suggestions for coping? Or should I just bail?\n",

        "text": "I've done more than my fair share of phone-jockeying, and despite become a jaded, husk of a man, there were still days when the utter stupidity of the general public shook me to my core. \n\nI worked for an energy provider in the UK, taking inbound calls with issues pertaining to their bills and services. The hours were long, the KPIs harsh, but the coffee was free. I was deep into a 10 hour shift when my next call blipped through.\n\n\"I've just received this bill dated the 18th that tells me my balance is £xx.\"\n\nI checked the account and confirmed that on the 18th his balance was that amount.\n\n\"However on the 20th I made a payment so surely my balance should be £yy\"\n\nI confirmed that his addition was all correct.\n\n\"So this statement is incorrect?\"\n\nI confirmed that with the addition of his payment, it was now an outdated figure.\n\n\"So why are you sending me incorrect statements?\"\n\nI went to answer and found I didn't know where to start. I spent a couple of seconds shaping an answer. In this silence, the customer ploughed forward. \n\n\"Surely if I make a payment, you should declare on the statement.. Why doesn't this piece of paper have my payment on it.\"\n\nI decided to try for the straight-forward approach, a technique that actually fails more often than it should.\n\n\"Because the payment was made once the bill had been printed and posted to you.\n\n\"So?\"\n\nAt this point I was lost. My biggest flaw in dealing with the public is assuming that their level of understanding was on the same level as mine. 9/10 times this is a fair criticism as I have had training and experience in the industry and it is my day to day life. Others who only deal with this for 10 minutes every 3 months would not be as understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, there is that 1/10 who just seemed to utilising a different operating system in life.\n\n\"Quite frankly I'm disgusted that such a prestigious company would allow such blatant misinformation to be sent out. Are you trying to get me to pay again?\"\n\nI amassed my arsenal and started to rally a counter-offensive.\n\n\"But we didn't know you were going to make a payment when that was sent\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\nThat was starting to bug me. He didn't seem to be listening, just waiting for me to finish talking so he could continue the rant.\n\n\"I'm not impressed with this service and the excuses you are making for it, and I can see this leading to me changing supplier\"\n\nExcuses?\n\nI reached that point that all in retail are familiar with. Fuck this. No jury in the world would convict me.\n\n\"I just want to summarise your issue sir.\"\n\n\"Go ahead\"\n\n\"Letter on the 18th?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"Payment on the 20th?\"\n\n\"Thats right\"\n\n\"Letter in hand now\"\n\n\"Yep\"\n\n\"I ask sir, how would you have wanted this to play out.\"\n\n\"Well the statement would have my payment declared on it.\"\n\n\"But we don't have the technology to amend letters once they are in transit to you. No-one does.\"\n\n\"Well, then it should have been cancelled once I made that payment.\"\n\n\"Nor do we have the capability to remote detonate statements whilst in the mail, sir.\"\n\nI think at this point something magical happen and the customer started to realise that not only was he wrong, he was stupidly wrong. The customer started to trip and stutter, trying to reiterate his previous complaints, but realiseg that they held little water.\n\nAt this point I utilised the greatest arrow in my quiver.\n\nSilence.\n\nNothing unnerves customers who are arguing more than silence. They feel a need to fill the void and will keep going even when common sense is screaming to shut up.\n\n\"I think I see where I made a mistake in my calculations\"\n\n\"Excellent sir. May I preemptively apologise for any statements that may be incorrect *by the time they reach you*\"\n\nThat last statement was dancing close to the line, but I couldn't resist.\n\nThe customer left the conversation a broken man. \n\nI used to get along well with my manager, and he used to offer that if we had any calls that we were uncertain of we could pass them along to him and he would listen to them off record and provide feedback and advice. I offered this call and sat back for ten minutes watching him stare into the middle distance, lightly shaking his head.",

Eventually they hung up and called back 20 minutes later. I'm sorry I'm not sorry but I hope something does happen to this lady that then causes this guy to drink himself to death. The world would be a better place without them. They showed zero compassion toward how they are being toward another human or how their actions could affect the world around them. I know I sound heartless but fuck man who honestly wants to be around people like that?  Bye Felicia. \nThis ca",

If you haven't heard any updates or such from the customers, you call them to check they're okay?\nMoving swiftly along, we have a short conversation (10 minutes) about how my life is going, how I keep track of economy, my future plans with education and such, and basicly that I don't really have anything I need help with.

        "text": "And hello to you all! I have posted a few times on this subreddit, but this is the first time I post a story of my own. \n\nTo provide a bit of context: I work at a call centre that handles (outsourced) calls from the United States for cable, internet and phone technical issues and billing issues. Most of the customers we handle are either Puerto Ricans, Snowbirds, or Old people, and it provides services to upscale markets from what I can recall. Most of the calls are actually pleasant, and irate customers are few and far in between, with most supervisor calls mostly are this because the tech failed to arrive or the credit that they are requesting is higher than what frontline agents can provide.\n\nI got on a fight with a really shitty customer, who wanted to escalate the call for a petty reason: a letter telling him about a $2.50 increase on the bill that only applied to cable customers (which he was not since 2 months ago), so I calmly explained that he could disregard that letter, as the information thereby included did not apply to him. Instead of understanding, he went berserk, accused me of lying, and started to talk smack. The last few minutes of that conversation went like this:\n\n&gt;me: \"Sir, regardless of what that letter says, the information does no longer apply to you.\"\n\n&gt;cust: \"No, it does, because you and your company are liars. I want that amount credited, plus my three last bills credited too.\"\n\n&gt;me: \"I do apologize, but per policy we can only credit up until the previous month if there are notes indicating about outages or promised credits, which are not in here.\"\n\n&gt;cust: \"You are saying a load of bullshit. Get me someone who actually speaks English.\"\n\n&gt;my jimmies are getting rustled: I speak Spanish, English, Portuguese and a bit of Japanese...\n\n&gt; me: \"We are speaking in English. And I am trying to help you, so...\"\n\n&gt;he cuts my conversation:\n\n&gt;cust: \"Get me your supervisor! This is an order! Obey it! I don't want to talk with you, because you are incompetent.\"\n\n&gt;I try to reply, but he keeps on cutting on my comments.\n\n&gt;Cust: \"Get me your supervisor! I'm giving you a direct order and you must obey me!\"\n\n&gt;me: \"I'm sorry, but your issue is non-escalable. This was a misunderstanding, and your account no longer has cable, so you are free to throw away that letter.\n\n&gt;Cust: \"No! You're lying, and you are fucking retarded and incompetent! Now, get me your supervisor right now!\"\n\n&gt;me: \"Sir, I will advice you that if you continue to throw insults at us, I will be forced to terminate this call.\"\n\n&gt;Cust: \"Oh! So you are threatening me! You're threatening me, you piece of shit? Now, get me your fucking supervisor, or cancel my services!\"\n\n&gt;I remain silent.\n\n&gt;Cust: \"Get me your supervisor! Get me your supervisor! Get me your supervisor! Get me your supervisor! Get me your supervisor! Get me your supervisor! Get me your supervisor! Get me your supervisor! ...\"\n\n&gt;I lost count after the tenth or twelfth time.\n\n&gt;me: \"As I was saying, this is still a non-escalable issue. You are not being given this charge. And my supervisor will say exactly the same thing.\"\n\n&gt;Cust: \"Fuck you! I will give you two options: Either you send me to disconnect this account, or you will get me to your supervisor so that I can file a complaint about how incompetent you are.\"\n\n&gt;at this point, I had it.\n\n&gt;Me: \"In this case, due to quality assurance purposes, I will hang up on your call. Have a nice day.\"\n\n&gt;Before hitting the release button, I hear a string of incoherent phrases and a lot of F-words. I threw my headset in disgust at the keyboard.\n\nAfter this incident, I reported the call to my supervisor, and left some warning notes on the account. This was perhaps the only customer that I actually have hanged upon on this campaign in eight months that I have worked here.\n",

        "text": "Hey, TFCC! I'm back again with another story.\n\nI (obviously) work @ a call center. We sell insurance products for a few different companies. I specifically sell policies for children that parents and grandparents usually purchase. Our company pushes us to sell as much as possible, since we are a \"sales center\".\n\nYesterday, I was on the call with a client from Massachusetts (\"MM\" for Massachusetts man), and I was trying to go into the application when he hits me with this zinger:\n\n&gt;MM: I'm a very visual person, and I don't do things over the phone, so I really need you to send me all this information so I can read over it for myself.\n\nI hear this so often, I have a cookie-cutter reply for it (don't we all at some point?):\n\n&gt;Me: I understand, sir; unfortunately, I do everything here over the phone, and I do not personally send marketing material from the enrollment center--  \n&gt;MM: (interrupting) Well I have a learning disability so I can't do this over the phone. I have to *see* what I'm doing.  \n&gt;Me: Okay, since you requested the information today, I'm sure you will receive the brochure soon. I conduct my business over the phone, so unfortunately, I cannot assist you further. Feel free to contact me once you receive the information in the mail.  \n&gt;MM: Fine, I'll just do everything through the mail then.  \n&gt;Me: That's fine; if you have any questions later or choose to proceed with the application over the phone, give me a call! Have a good day, MM!\n\nI normally put the phone on mute so I can do my call wrap-up while the recording is on (saves some ACW time). Secretly, I sometimes like to see if people will say stupid stuff when they think I'm not listening (which has happened before).\n\n&gt;MM: (thinking I've disconnected) I'm definitely not calling you again.  \n&gt;Me: (unmuting the phone) That's fine, MM. Have a good day!\n\nHe later called in and spoke with another agent, no doubt complaining about me. The other agent fortunately sits next to me, so I asked her and she rolled her eyes and said, \"Don't worry about it, he was being so rude.\"\n\nMy only regret is that I didn't come up with a sassier response to the client.\n\n*edit: I feel like I should mention that we do not, in fact, send anything from the CC I work at. I guess we're better described as an insurance agency? Anyways, I didn't want to come off as a jerk or something. I literally cannot assist someone who doesn't want to proceed over the phone.*",
