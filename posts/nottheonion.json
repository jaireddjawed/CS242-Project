Critics also say LGBT people and those with mental health issues are targeted for deliverance in the belief that their sexuality or psychiatric problems are the result of demonic possession.\n\nThe Vatican training course, which will be held at the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum in Rome between 16-21 April, will focus on exorcism and the prayer of liberation, a prayer commonly used for deliverance from possession.\n\n\u201cThe fight against the evil one started at the origin of the world, and is destined to last until the end of the world,\u201d Fr Cesare Truqui, one of the speakers, told Vatican News.\n\n\u201cBut today we are at a stage crucial in history: many Christians no longer believe in [the devil\u2019s] existence, few exorcists are appointed and there are no more young priests willing to learn the doctrine and practice of liberation of souls.\u201d\n\nFr Benigno Palilla, an exorcist from Sicily who reported a tripling of demonic possession cases on the island, acknowledged the issue was controversial, but added: \u201cThe demoniacs \u2026 suffer a lot.\u201d\n\nTraining in deliverance was essential, he told Vatican Radio. \u201cA self-taught exorcist certainly makes errors. I will say more: it would also take a period of apprenticeship, as happens for many professionals.\u201d\n\nIn Ireland, Fr Pat Collins said he had been inundated, almost daily, with people seeking help to deal with what they believed to be demonic possession and other evil, and called for more training in exorcism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only in recent years that the demand has risen exponentially,\u201d he told the Irish Catholic. \u201cWhat I\u2019m finding out desperately, is people who in their own minds believe \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 that they\u2019re afflicted by an evil spirit.\n\u201cI think in many cases they wrongly think it, but when they turn to the church, the church doesn\u2019t know what to do with them.\u201d\n\nPope Francis has said if a priest becomes aware of \u201cgenuine spiritual disturbances \u2026 he must not hesitate to refer the issue to those who, in the diocese, are charged with this delicate and necessary ministry, namely, exorcists\u201d.\n\nThe Church of England offers guidelines on deliverance which say that for some people \u201cgoing through times of suffering and anxiety, or when distressed by what seem to be continuing experiences of evil within or around them \u2026 it may be right to ask for God\u2019s saving help through the church\u2019s deliverance ministry\u201d.\n\nThe guidelines, which were updated in 2012, say caution must be exercised and \u201cthe ministry of exorcism and deliverance may only be exercised by a priest authorised by the diocesan bishop\u201d.\n\nSuch priests should be trained in deliverance and should not minister alone. They should be covered by adequate insurance, the document says.\n\n\u201cLanguage, body language and touch should be courteous and considerate \u2026 No one should receive ministry against their will.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines say doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists should be consulted where appropriate, and that deliverance should be followed up with continuing pastoral care and \u201cshould be done with a minimum of publicity\u201d.\nAccording to Anne Richards, the C of E\u2019s national adviser on such issues: \u201cExorcism in a technical sense is incredibly rare. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever come across a case that\u2019s been authorised.\u201d\n\nEach of the C of E\u2019s 42 dioceses has at least one person experienced and trained in deliverance, she said.\n\nThe church was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d that deliverance and healing should be undertaken in collaboration with professionals, such as doctors, and in the context of good safeguarding practice, she said.\n\nBut, she added, \u201cI accept in some cases people get together and do something ad hoc. It shouldn\u2019t happen \u2013 it needs to be a proper process.\u201d\n\nAccording to Christianity and Mental Health, a report by Theos, demand in the UK is being partly \u201cdriven by immigrant communities and Pentecostal churches which are very open about their exorcism services\u201d.\n\nBen Ryan, its author, said charismatic and Pentecostal churches, particularly in areas with large west African communities, were advertising \u201chealings\u201d and exorcism outside their premises.\n\nBut, he said, \u201csome Christians are sometimes treating mental health issues as if everything is spiritual. So if someone tells a church leader they are suffering from depression, sometimes the response is that everything can be treated with prayer. The extreme end of that is exorcism.\u201d\n\nThe report quoted one chaplain, who said he had \u201cnever seen anything I would say that looked like demonic possession, but I\u2019ve seen plenty of people who have been told that\u2019s what they\u2019re experiencing by other Christians\u201d.\nPriests in the US have also reported a growing demand for exorcisms in recent years. \n\nThe shortage of clergy trained in exorcism has led to a growing number of independent operators in Europe, who will rid people and properties of demons for up to \u20ac500 a time, according to the Economist.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677528145.0},{"title":"Majority of drivers say aggressive cyclists threaten their safety \u2013
