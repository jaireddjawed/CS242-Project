        "text": "To clarify, I'm looking for research on how individuals think and act under different political regimes. For example, imagine an anarchist, a liberal, a communist, and a fascist are all living in the contemporary United States. How would each person behave within such a political context and what factors influence their behavior (community with like-minded individuals, employment status, education, etc...)? Now imagine those same individuals living in China, Saudi Arabia, and Norway. Do their personal behaviors change with the context or remain constant? When the regime and their personal ideology contradict, does their performance conform to the political environment or do they adhere to their own beliefs in their actions (and, if so, what form do these actions take)?\n\nI realize this is a very large topic, so any recommendations for literature and authors to gain a better understanding of the foundations of this sort of issue would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: As a quick note, I have found a number of articles regarding how environment can influence attitudes, but at this moment I'm particularly interested in how pre-existing attitudes manifest in behavior under a given political regime, especially when they contradict. Maybe something like [*Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behavior: An Introduction to Theory and Research* by Fishbein and Azjen](https://books.google.co.kr/books/about/Belief_attitude_intention_and_behavior.html?id=8o0QAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y) but applied to political science.

It's usually always church, synagogue, or simple house of worship/praise.\"\n\nMy question is, does the chapel term hold some other significance other than a religious meaning? Also, is this naming pattern found country wide or is it limited to the southeast region of the United States?\n\nThanks.",

Thomas Sowell, in [one of his columns](http://www.daily-journal.com/opinion/columnists/national/thomas-sowell-the-left-and-the-masses/article_a988154b-e4c4-566e-87c5-8cfad9feab5c.html), says that: \n\n&gt;\"One of the most recent efforts of the left is the spread of laws and policies that forbid employers from asking job applicants whether they have been arrested or imprisoned. This is said to be to help ex-cons get a job after they have served their time, and ex-cons are often either poor or black, or both.\n\n\n&gt;First of all, many of the left's policies to help blacks are disproportionately aimed at helping those blacks who have done the wrong thing — and whose victims are disproportionately those blacks who have been trying to do the right thing. In the case of this ban on asking job applicants whether they have criminal backgrounds, the only criterion seems to be whether it sounds good or makes the left feel good about themselves....An empirical study some years ago examined the hiring practices of companies that did a background check on all the employees they hired. It found that such companies hired more blacks than companies which did not follow that unusual practice.\" \n\nMy problem with his commentary on this subject, among other complaints I have, is that he 1) conflates eliminating the \"check-off\" box with background checks in general (i.e. the \"check-off\" box might have gone away, but background checks are in place) and 2) because he references one (unnamed) study, and seems to conclude that this is the general trend among employers. \n\nMy question is whether or not concerns 1) and 2) are legitimate, and that if there is empirical evidence of a trend for employers to reject minority applicants due to the elimination of the \"check-off\" box for felons.

They believed that the forces of supply and demand are driven by the invisible hand of market and any government intervention will lead to the disturbance of this equilibrium.\n\n2. John Maynard Keynes, a much later Economist, believed that money played a great role in the economy and at least one use of money (as a hoarded asset) might lead to a depression over time, and Government spending might be required to restore that equilibrium again.\n\n3. Come the Great Depression in 1930s, and seems like Keynes was right. He insists on Government spend a lot on various projects, which results in an increase in employment and ultimately the end of the Great Depression.\n\nI'd basically like to know that what is the current opinion of most modern, seasoned economists regarding this matter? Does perfect competition (Classical) or Government Intervention (Keynesian) is the correct way?",
