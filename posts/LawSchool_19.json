        "text": "I’m a 1L and single mother. I have no family or close friends in my city. 100% custody. A very tight budget. \n\nEverything was fine until I had to put my daughter in daycare in October. Before that, she had only ever been around me and her nanny (plus one other child). Unfortunately the nanny moved to a new state, and I couldn’t find anyone to replace her for the same rate. My only option was daycare. \n\nDaycare is actually a little cheaper by the hour, so I thought it would be a good thing. Unfortunately, my daughter has been sick almost constantly since she started there. I thought maybe just the first six weeks would be bad, so I struggled through last semester. My professors accepted my daughter’s doctors notes and let me watch class recordings. I did really well in my legal research and writing class, but below median in my doctrinal courses. \n\nThis semester, I’ve probably missed more class than I’ve attended, and I have no hope things will get better. My daughter’s pediatrician says it’s the worst year for childhood illness she’s ever witnessed (and my fellow parents confirm this). She said to expect her to be sick three out of four weeks for the first year. If she has a fever, she can’t go to school for 24 hours after it’s gone. I still have to pay for her spot though, and I can’t afford a babysitter on top of that. I believe I could study on my own and still pass, but the ABA attendance policies don’t allow it. \n\nSo I’m admitting defeat. Thankfully I have a career as a teacher to fall back on, and if I want to return to law school when my daughter is older, I’ll still have a full tuition scholarship waiting for me. \n\nHonestly, the hardest part is feeling embarrassed to tell everyone in my life. I don’t want to feel like a failure or like I couldn’t do it. I loved my classes, and it wasn’t even that stressful or hard for me. But I know how it looks from the outside, and that sucks. Maybe I shouldn’t care so much about what other people think, but I do. Any advice?\n\nI’m also considering not going back, which would be even harder to admit to everyone. I love law school, but the more I learn about being a lawyer, the less I feel like I’ll enjoy it. Plus, I actually miss being a teacher. I miss reading and writing for fun, and I know I’ll miss the schedule.",

I have the option to count it as an LLM or to just have it as part of my home university. \nFirst question: is there any downside to having it counted as LLM if I wanted to be hired in the US in the future?\n\nIn 2-3 years I plan to apply to a JD in the US. Are there things I should consider and what are my chances at getting into a good law school and/or biglaw? Will the c-k LLM even help?\n\nGot some internships and work experience in law firms, and I am 26. \n\nAll opinions appreciated.",

I love working there and I am certain that they are going to hire me.\n\nNow, I just don’t give the slightest shit about school. Why the fuck am I leaning nuanced law subjects in areas that will never be relevant to me when I handle 3-5 hearings a week by myself? Nobody in the world needs to hear my half-assed first amendment analysis of a fake hypo. Literally, no one is benefiting from that shit. The professor doesn’t give a shit, my boss doesn’t give a shit, and the community doesn’t give a shit. My office is understaffed and half of our attorneys are gone for different reasons. I could be shouldering more of the stress in my office and serving the community but instead I have to read 50 pages about the Inter-American Human rights system. GTFO.\n\nThat’s all.",

They’re not giving you an interview just to meet a quota or because they’re bored. They like your resume, your stats, and your application materials. They think you could have what it takes to work there. Own that!\n\n2. They already like paper you. The interview is designed to see if they like YOU. Like, as a person. You don’t need to talk endlessly about your grades or accomplishments. They have your resume. They know all that stuff already. They want to know if they would enjoy spending 55 hours a week working side by side with you. Be friendly. Be personable. Don’t be afraid to talk about things not related to the firm or profession. The best interviews I had (and ones that led to offers) involved less talk about the actual work and more talk about hobbies, bourbon, sports, and travel.\n\n\nBest of luck out there!",

        "text": "I’m just over 6 months into a 2-year state Supreme Court clerkship and I’m finding it a pretty miserable experience. For one, I’ve come to realize the work doesn’t suit my working style (working on one opinion for multiple months, editing and re-editing and re-editing; I’m much more a shorter task-oriented person). Second and more importantly, the dynamic between my judge, my co-clerk and me sucks. Co-clerk is career clerk with 10+ years of experience and is phenomenal at the job. Judge looks to them for advice on everything, never takes my input, and gives them the more interesting and challenging opinions. \n\nThe one saving grace is that compared to most of my friends from law school, my work-life balance is pretty stellar. I’m able to spend quality time with my family which is important, work from home often (which has its pros and cons) and the pay is fine (but 1/3 of a big law job).\n\nRecently I started toying with the idea of ending the clerkship early and getting another job. I’m not worried about being able to get the other job (though I’m not positive whether it would be big law, policy work or something else), and I bet that my judge would see the benefit of getting a new (and likely better) clerk in for next year. I guess I’m wondering if anyone has ever done this, heard of someone who has done it, or otherwise has advice. I don’t think there would be any problem with gaps on the resume since it would just look like a one-year clerkship. I appreciate any advice you all have.",

My parents both came to the US in the late nineties before I was born and tried to apply for asylum but essentially got withholding of removal. They both lived in the US for about 25 years now and then my parents got a divorce. When I turned 21 (I am 24 now) we started the process of trying to obtain a green card for both my parents but unfortunately after the divorce my father allegedly broke the law for the first time and forged a signature on a construction document (stupid) and was issued to leave the US. He voluntarily left in hopes of keeping his social security when he comes back. My question is.. what is the best way to bring my father back? My 14 year old brother is mentally suffering without him and it seems the lawyers my mom and I hired are too busy to even answer our questions. \n\nAnything helps. Thank you.",

I'm 5'11\" but that was a good amount of extra weight, and I felt like absolute crap by the end of my summer internship. \n\nIn August, I was still hovering around 240, feeling depressed, and I decided I needed to make a change. I have a stationary bike, and I decided I would try to do 15 minutes a day, every day, and just see how long I could go. \n\nFast forward to today, and I just finished an hour plus workout, hit the scale, and broke 220 for the first time in 5 years. Folks, I'm over 40 and I've got 3 kids. If I can get off my butt and make healthy changes, anyone can. And it's not just my health, my grades improved dramatically first semester, and while I know that's normal for a lot of 2Ls as we figure things out, I believe at least some of it is due to my improved mental and physical health. \n\nPlease know that if you are depressed about your weight or health, you're not alone, and I believe that you can make positive change (really!). And if you are depressed right now, today, and want someone to talk to, drop me a line and I'm happy to try and help.

Just background nvm)*\n\nI've been seriously slacking in my academic life all this time. It was an odd novelty for me. I'd always been a great student. But right after I got accepted I was horribly burnt out and there was COVID, so uni started remotely right away and stayed so for a year and a half. I found myself depressed, having serious issues with concentrating, memorizing information and so many more problems. I've had to retake almost every exam throughout my entire uni experience. In fact I'm avoiding studying for now as I'm writing this. Every aspect of uni and student life is a bigger problem to me than it should be lol. I've gone through rounds of therapy for all that and anxiety and depression, but the fact that university has become 100% intolerable for me is final.\n\nSo I gave up on \"recovering\" and decided to do stuff outside of university. I've done lots of pretty great programs so far, volunteering, remote internships for a bunch of firms, government internships here, started doing lots of courses raging from languages to leadership, even have a job offer now. All this excites me so much and fills me with hope for the future, when university sucks the life out of me every day. And generally, no employer up until now has given a damn about my academics.  I know many professionals in the field that admitted to being sucky as a student and catching up after graduating and doing pretty great. They say it's true for the most part that practice makes up for everything here.\n\nHonestly? I don't know what I'm asking with this post. Maybe whether all I'm doing is compensating for my crappy student records? Is it truly possible to land further educational and career opportunities in such a case? \n\nIdk I just feel like so outcasted with this weird experience. Thank you for reading this much.",

What makes it even worse is all the arguments are recorded and anyone within my class could see it if they want to. \n\nToday is also my birthday, and now I’m unfortunately in a sour mood and questioning if I’ll be a good lawyer. If anyone could give me some advice on what to do to lessen nerves so that this doesn’t happen again that would be great.",

Maybe it will benefit some people but I've known what I wanted to do with my degree since before enrolling.\n\nHas anyone else had something like this?  Am I crazy for being mad that they're calling this mandatory?  I'm leaning towards not going.",

        "text": "This is my first year of law school. I had a really tough year. I suffer from Crohn’s disease and ADHD. The school refuses to give me accommodations although I have diagnoses proving my conditions. I got a full ride scholarship at a not very reputable school (bottom 25% of the country). I didn’t want to come here because it’s far from home and I honestly was not proud to be here. I got accepted to better schools but chose to come here because it was completely free since I don’t have much money. \n\nI was academically dismissed my first semester. I was a .01 away from avoiding dismissal. Although I was reinstated, they took away my scholarship. The person in charge of my scholarship keeps on telling me to review the handbook. I did and it says anything below a 2.00 GPA is a dismissal but my GPA was 2.19. They are now saying I need a 2.20 GPA because they recently changed the rules. \n\nI heard that the school is suffering financially from a teacher. I think they are doing this because they want the money back. My brother who is an attorney sent the school a demand letter type thing and now I’m being harassed. I’m cold called all the time in class now and the Deans keep on wanting to meet with me. I’m so stressed due to this situation on top of my school work. \n\nI emailed and applied some other schools wanting to apply as a 1L. Some of them are online and said they could give me a similar scholarship which would be great. Should I leave my current school in the middle of the semester? I would transfer as a 2L but I don’t think my grades are good enough because I didn’t receive accommodations. Also, the school is in trouble because students are apparently using AI to answer essay questions some how. I imagine this hurt me in the curve. \n\nMy brother says I should sue the school because they are violating the contract but I honestly just want to cut my losses and go home. What would you all do?",
