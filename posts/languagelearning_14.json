        "text": "So, this is rather complicated as Russian isn’t even my native tongue nor is English but my parents decided to raise me in Russian and then introduced me to English at age 7-8. I lived in countries that commonly use Russian or English as second language (Uzbekistan and UAE respectively) but never entirely. I know bits of Arabic and Uzbek but not enough to speak and currently moved to Georgia (country) where both English and Russian is used but once again as second languages. \n\nSo, it’s rather complicated and getting affordable educational resources can be a pain in the ass. Overall, i can express myself better in English at most fields of the language, especially academic jargon, the only exception is some random household words. However Russian, it’s complicated as i have no idea where to even start. My level is about B1-B2 i’d say but there are most random words i just dont know that can be classified as A2-B1, since i started reading literature i just know most random C1-C2 words ever. I enjoy reading and i thought literature could help but it just drives me crazy as i have to translate at least one or two words per sentence, so i miss out on my usual reading pleasure or even comprehending what am i reading. Most Russian grammar books are straight up confusing and overwhelming, the only thing they improve is my grammatical writing but i want more than that. \n\nThough i’m not sure if i can call this language attrition since there are words i just dont know at all, not that i necessarily forgot them, but sometimes that too. I’m 17 btw if that helps. \n\nCould anyone advise anything?",

I kept telling myself at the beginning that I would do x lessons a day, or x minutes every day for x months. One thing to note is that I’m also a procrastinator. The first week or two would always end well, and I’d be able to get my daily lessons in. Not long after, I’d start to skip my lessons each day, and gradually stop doing them altogether.

I can speculate on why this might be the case, but I'll try to keep this post short.\n\n\\* Actually happened to me today. Went to the zoo (I live in China) and saw 蠵龜 written on the sign for a loggerhead sea turtle. First character is apparently so uncommon, seemingly pretty much only used for this one word, that it had pinyin next to it. Was the only animal in that part of the zoo that had it IIRC.\n\nThat might actually be another reason I like doing this for Chinese specifically: often get to encounter rare characters this way. Most of the characters you encounter this way are very obvious and simple phono-semantic compounds, but still.",

But how to find that input?\n\nSo I decided to try to build something to solve it and wanted to share.\n\nThat is [Umi](https://www.umiapp.co/). I scraped a ton of TV shows and movies, cut them into clips, and organized vocabulary by frequency of use.\n\nRight now each language has about 4500 words and 10,000+ clips (\\~2-3 per word).  Spanish, Japanese, and English are ready, with French and German coming soon. There's built in SRS. It’s free with ads.\n\nThe ultimate goal is a fully comprehensible step ladder built into immersion. This may take a while, so for now I’ve been focused on building in tools to help understand the clips.\n\nHope you all find this useful! I’d really appreciate any feedback.",

        "text": "(Based on a comment i made in some other sub)\n\nNews channels! Some channels like France24, DW, BBC and the NHK publish there content (audio and sometimes videos) in multi language formats. I'll post specific links via comments to this comment, for the major sites: [BBC learn spanish](https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/spanish/index.shtml); [DW learn German](https://learngerman.dw.com/en/learn-german/s-9528); [TVMONDE learn French](https://www.tv5monde.com/cms/USA/Teach-Learn-French/p-13402-s5-z413-lg3-Teach-Learn-French.htm); [SBS's educational language resources](https://www.sbs.com.au/learn/resources?section=Languages)\n\nIf you have an android phone (or android emulator/android virtual machine) you can use google's TTS service, which has actually improved quite a bit in recent years. You can choose from various voices through various languages, atm what I do is on my computer or phone I copy the text from news sites and paste them into a txt file that I can then have TTS read through an app on my phone called moonreader (there are also open source free alternatives via fdroid). This allows me to control how fast the narration is while learning new vocab on actual ongoing events. Not to be relied on for pronunciation but its constantly improving and is way cheaper than buying audiobooks!\n\nLast bit of advice I can think of right now is VIDEO GAMES! Lately I've been having a blast playing through a buncha games with my language switched to one of the languages I'm learning. With cheap monthly trials (that can be abused wink wink) such as Microsoft's game pass you can access tons of games in most if not all the major languages.

I've been working with the same Spanish teacher for four years now and he has been outstanding. Today for the first time, we did a practice DELE C2 level listening comprehension test. I just wanted to get some idea of what C2 is like and what I can expect. \n\nThe examples I listened to featured different accents although apart from Spain, I couldn't tell you where the others were from. One of the examples had to do with labor laws and women and the other was a roundtable of psychologists discussing how children's natural strengths and talents are recognized and cultivated in school (or not, in the case of this particular discussion). \n\nNow, I don't know much about labor laws or child psychology in ENGLISH so I was pleasantly surprised to be able to understand the entirety of the conversations. The questions though, were not as concrete. Instead, they were purposefully vague and very much focused on the minutiae of the presentation. That surprised me about the test. It wasn't enough just to understand what was being said but also be able to determine who had which point of view and how what they said meshed with that perspective. \n\nStill, for my first time listening at that level, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish and I had to share it with people who would understand.

That's how it seems like from what I've read/watch so far:\n\n1. As a baby, you gotta start simple. Simple subjects, short sentences, lots of visual cues. Best content would be content aimed for kids, but of course, the more personally compelling to you,  the better.\n2. Start with listening in order to know the sounds of the words when you read them. Listening with subtitles/transcripts is ok too.\n3. Once you acquire a considerable amount of words by listening, you can start reading, so you won't need to look up every single word in any text. Of course, start with the easiest content possible.\n4. Now just ramp up the difficulty level of your immersion content as you progress.\n\nIs that it? Any tips on how to bring this to a classroom would be great too.",

        "text": "Ibn Khaldun on language learning:\n\n&gt;Likewise, we find many people who have a good (linguistic) habit and a good (ability to express themselves in) both prose and poetry, but cannot distinguish between the vowel endings of subject and object, or nominative and genitive, and know nothing about the rules of Arabic philology. This shows that the (linguistic) habit is different from Arabic philology and can completely dispense with it.\n&gt;\n&gt;We find that some scholars who are skilled in the vowel endings have a good knowledge of how it is with the (linguistic) habit. This, however, is rare and a matter of chance. It happens mostly to those (students) who have close contact with the Book of Sibawayh. For Sibawayh did not restrict himself to the rules governing the vowel endings, but filled his work with Arab proverbs and evidential Arab verses and expressions. Thus, his work contains a good deal of (the things that go with) teaching the (linguistic habit). Therefore, we find that the (students) who apply themselves diligently to (Sibawayh's Book) and come to know it, learn a good deal of Arab speech (from it).\n&gt;\n&gt;[…]\n&gt;\n&gt;Students who have close contact with the books of recent scholars that have nothing of the sort but deal only with grammatical rules and contain no Arab poems or (documents of) Arab speech, for this very reason are rarely conscious of (linguistic) habit or aware of its importance. One finds that they think they have gotten somewhere in knowledge of the Arabic language. In fact, they are farther from it than anyone else.\n&gt;\n&gt;[…]\n&gt;\n&gt;With them, Arabic philology thus came to be, in a way, one of the intellectual norms of logic and dialectics and (thereby) remote from the ways and habit of language.\n&gt;\n&gt;Arabic philologists in these cities and their adjacent regions thus became totally estranged from the (linguistic) habit, and it was as if they had not studied the Arabic language (at all). The only reason was their aversion to investigating the evidential verses and word combinations and to making a discerning study of the methods of the (Arabic) language, as well as their disregard for the (necessity of) constant practice of those things by the student. In fact, (to investigate these things) is the best way to teach the habit of the (Arabic) language. The (grammatical) rules are merely means for purposes of instruction. However, (scholars) employed them as they were not intended to be employed, and caused them to become a purely scholarly discipline. (Thus,) they were deprived of their (real) fruit.\n&gt;\n&gt;Our remarks in this chapter show that the habit of the Arabic language can be obtained only through expert knowledge of the (documents of) Arab speech. Thereby, the imagination of (the student) will eventually have a picture of the loom on which the Arabs wove their word combinations, so that he can use it himself. Thus, he achieves the position of one who grew up with them and had close personal contact with the ways they expressed themselves in their speech and who, thus, eventually obtains the firm habit of expressing what he wants to express in the manner in which they would have said it. \n&gt;\n&gt;[…]\n&gt;\n&gt;[When one obtains a good linguistic habit,] (The use of proper) word combinations becomes a simple matter for him. In this respect he hardly ever swerves from the way of Arab eloquence. If he hears a word combination that is not along those lines, he spits it out, and his ear recoils from it upon the slightest reflection. Indeed, no reflection whatever (is needed, for his reaction is) the consequence of the (linguistic) habit he has obtained.\n&gt;\n&gt;Habits that are firmly established and rooted in their proper places appear to be natural and innate in those places.",

        "text": "Man, reading literature (specifically classics of the respective language) in a language you thought you handled well really humbles you down\n\nI've read a lot in English, while I can admit that certain books like Uncle Tom's Cabin or To Kill A Mockingbird are a bit more difficult to read I can still manage them. Same goes for Swedish. Spanish however, even tho it is my mother tongue, I haven't lived in a Hispanic country for a long time. While reading 'general fiction' (any books really, Hunger Games, or detective books etc) is no bigger issue, when it comes to the classics like Huasipungo, Don Quixote, and so on it's a struggle. \n\nThe language is so profound, there a bunch of references to the history of the country (or continent), there's so much to interpret and usually a lot metaphors/saying that maybe aren't used as much anymore. I get confused at times reading, whether to take a sentence literally or if it is some type of saying I haven't read/heard before. \n\nAny advice on how to go about when reading classics in their native language? Not specifically to Spanish, but in general. Is it better to just not get hooked up on every detail and just push through it or better to stop and google all the references? Or literally any advice at all",

I sadly barely used it, but noticed most of the Plus features were useless so decided I won't buy next Premium. The best thing about it was no ads. \n\nI usually create smaller sets with 20-30 words because for me that's good amount, anything more than 30-35 would be hard to learn. But recently I realized they made is so I can't study Flashcard set more than once. And I can't test more than once. You need Premium for unlimited features. I'm pretty sure it was not like that in 2021 and before when I didn't have Premium yet...",

She says my pronunciation is pretty good.\n\nCan't beat the in-person stuff, but what resources would you recommend to supplement the things that we learn? Is there a good book out there?\n\nMy struggle is sounding things out; in English it's easy, even if the word is complex, so having to go back to sound out new letters has proven to be tough. So any resource that helps me do that would be invaluable.",

Just \"picking up\" languages sounds like something for the streets, not something serious people do. They might hear about Krashen, but as \"the input guy\" who attracted a lot of controversy, and besides \"we've moved on since the 70s.\"\n\nSo the public thinks the debate is:\n\nSkill-building/memorization/exercises \nvs. \nInput/exposure/immersion\n\nBut in fact, researchers in second language acquisition, even the ones who hate Krashen's guts, all agree that comprehensible/communicative/meaning-focused input is fundamental. Their problem is with Krashen's idea that input _alone_ drives acquisition. \n\nNobody is proposing interaction, output, or noticing _instead of_ input. They are proposing that these are necessary _as well as_ input. \n\nSo in actual fact the debate is:\n\nInput only \nvs. \nInput plus\n\nBut people get confused and think skill-building (whether or not they call it that) is still in play as a viable theory. The SLA field moved on a long time ago, but people are still being sold a dud. \n\nPeople are bashing their heads against a brick wall and paying for the privilege, when there's a door two steps to the left called \"input\" which will get them _at least most_ of the way there.\n\nWhat am I missing?
