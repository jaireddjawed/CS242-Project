        "text": "\n\nLiving up to its title, Trey Edward Shult’s third feature crashes through the screen and leaves you gasping for air as you experience its relentless swirl of raw emotions. It is a sincere exploration of the complementary nature of humankind, and how inconceivable pain can lead to extreme beauty.\n\n\nMore than that, it is a truly ambitious feat of visual storytelling that expertly blends blazing colours, innovative camera movement, genuine performances, and a star-studded soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross into a mesmerizing two-acts fever dream. The strange alchemy sometimes makes for an almost synesthetic experience.\n\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the Florida coast, “Waves” revolves around the trials and tribulations of a middle-class African American family. Handsome, happy, and full of success, high school senior Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr) seems on top of the world. He embodies the popular kid, with a loving girlfriend and family and on his way to a wrestling scholarship. His younger sister on the other hand, brought to life with delicate sincerity by Taylor Russel, has a much more subdued presence and attitude. She lives in the shadow of her brother, as their overbearing father dedicates most of his energy and love towards his son’s achievements.\n“We are not afforded the luxury of being average.” He has first-hand experience growing up as a black man in the South and cannot allow his son lose focus of what it must take to prosper. That pressure will be instrumental in Tyler’s impending descent.\n\n\nGood intentions can go a long way, but often time the outcome is unpredictable. A series of unfortunate events enabled by a crucial lack of communication, and a lifelong philosophy of being alone against the world are the making of this regrettable tragedy.\n\n\nShults tackles a lot of current issues, mainly toxic masculinity, and the isolation of youth in the ever-connected world of today. How invisible barriers of communication are harder to break through than ever before. Social media is inherent to Tyler’s world, his image more important than his true self. And the stalking of his girlfriend on Instagram is what precedes the mid-point’s regrettable climax.\n\n\nHis damaged ego in this crucial moment is aptly mirrored by Kanye’s music, as “I am a God” blasts through his car radio and carries on over the scene. Music is inherently integral to the narrative throughout the film, in the same way it heavily influences our teenage years. More than a mere accompaniment, it acts as an immersive and significant story device. Shults does not just borrow from these artists he loves and grew up with, he aspires to emulate their themes and struggles. Be it Kanye West’s stormy angst, or Frank Ocean’s heartfelt vulnerability.\n\n\nTame Impala’s “Be Above it” is another good example of the symbiotic nature of the music and story beats. Tyler blissfully cruises to the tune at the beginning of the film on his way to school, seemingly at peace with the world and untormented. But a much more stripped-down version of the song is heard later-on. Erol Arkan’s rework is an amalgam of incessant drums, aggressive sounds clashing against each other and no lyrics besides a recurring whispering of the chorus, “Gotta be above it”. A psychedelic turmoil of raging emotions that encapsulates the evolution of Tyler’s psyche as he breaks down more and more.\n\n\nHis character is a composite of the actor and writer-director’s personal experiences, which makes him feel authentic and often relatable. Harrison Jr was asked about his background of growing up a black male in the south and gave advice to Shults so that his language and character seem accurate.\n\n\nAnother innovative artistic choice is the use of the aspect ratio as a narrative device. The camera moves with purpose, often as an extension of the character’s headspace. This is most apparent in the car scenes that feature a full 360 rotation of the camera from the inside, creating a dizzying and lasting effect. It is very telling of the nature of young love, beautiful and free but also dangerous and scary. The lens becomes narrower as the climax approaches, building on the anxiety and creating a claustrophobic effect, as if informing the viewer than whatever is about to happen cannot be avoided. As we recover from it, and leave Tyler’s turbulent anxiety for Emily’s introspective vulnerability, the lens starts widening again. It leads to a truly liberating feeling as we finally return to the original 1.85:1 ratio achieved with the anamorphic lens at the very end.\n\n\nMuch like the sun that emerges from the moon and shines through after a solar eclipse, Emily’s luminous presence takes over from her brother’s anxiety-filled journey and carries the contemplative second half of the story. This chasm is the very essence of the film, and why it works so effectively.\n\n\nSuch intricate storytelling relies heavily on the actors themselves, and Russel’s breakthrough performance effectively conveys all of Emily’s grief, subdued anger, and sensitivity.\n\n\nSame with Lucas Hedges (Luke), whose late appearance into the story feels anything but anecdotical. His relationship with Emily is at the heart of the 2nd half of the film, as they both try to reconcile with the cost and legitimacy of forgiveness and must let go of their demons. It is a healing journey, much needed after the frenzied nature of Tyler’s downfall. Never does it feel melodramatic, as every character seems fully-realized no matter how little screen-time they get.\n\n\nMistakes and tragedies are a part of life, but how we choose to deal with the aftermath makes all the difference.\n\n\nWaves can be defined as bursts of emotions, and their ripple effects are still felt long after the film is over. But no matter how hard they hit the shore; let us remember that they will always subside into the sea.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/z19v0c/thoughts_on_grandmas_boy_and_the_character_jp/",
        "text": "This is going to be a weird topic, and it does come from a personal space. Maybe a conversation can help me out understand something. \n\nIn the movie Grandmas Boy, some love it and most don't give a damn or think it's stupid, the way I perceive it is I feel sorry for the character JP. The movie leans very hard on making fun of this character and treating him like crap, despite his quirks, underlying exclusion issues, and an inflated ego. \n\nIn the movie JP acts arrogant and hates the testers who work under him, because he thinks they are \"jerks\". For a movie all about weird people, banter, and accepting the differences of others and how they live their life. The writers toward the end had a whole redemption opportunity for JP towards the end, when he finally opens up to Alex and offers to help him with the game he has been working on on his own. Alex reassures JP that everyone at work \"totally respects\" him and offers for JP to hang out with them. But, thinking they are clever, decided at the last minute to not be \"predictable\" and made JP turn into a real piece of shit and backstab Alex by stealing his game. Then they just leaned hard on how weird he is, petty and devious with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I guess they thought it was a good punchline. Kind of odd behavior for someone who from beginning to end just wanted to be accepted, dealing with jealousy, and learning to open up honestly with someone. There could have been a better feel good ending, where I think JP would take notes and offer to help Alex get it produced since he was having a hard time finishing the new game he was working on. \n\nThis type of humor seems to resonate a lot in my own life and the people around me. It's a type of sense of humor at the expense of others that kind of bothers me, and this movie just seems to justify it. I've seen people who were JPs in life, and others who were the other characters. \n\nIn my personal life, with family especially, I've actually been made fun of and compared to JP. It's due to a lot of misunderstanding, and issues on their part, them thinking I think I'm better than them or being a little different. So they rag on me and even knowing how I feel about it, it's justified to them no matter how much I have a private moment with one of them and try to understand. I really just want to be accepted, but any chance they got for the sake of a joke, they would rather use that than leave it be. \n\nI've seen similar things happen to others, a person just becomes a scapegoat so others can feel better about themselves, and these people go one of two ways. They leave and find others or become reclusive, or they become really angry and insecure individuals who never find peace creating a self fulfilling prophecy. It's the latter I feel bad about, because it can be so easily avoided, yet they become toxic themselves. Once said person becomes toxic, it's the others who can justify their treatment of that person by basically claiming \"SEE! He's a weirdo who won't learn and is unlikeable\". Then the shit hits the fan, and that person moves to start over somewhere else with a clean slate, or puts up with gossip and bullying acting like it doesn't bother him or just leading a sad life. \n\nThe way I look at it, this type of treatment is rampant, everyone picks someone who is different and justifies making them a bitch for their own amusement. Then that person becomes JP and tries very hard to show others they are better than them, not getting that they will find any excuse to treat you like crap. Sad thing is, in real life, people aren't as understanding as Alex and love the feeling of tormenting.   \n\n\nI think in a lot of Adam Sandler movies he promotes this weird bullying, humor at the expense of others type of mentality. A lot of people love his movies, including this one. And, I get banter is normal, and people need an ego check, but how does one avoid getting themselves into that position. What if a person isn't as clever or witty to defend themself, do they just sit down and take it?\n\nI oddly empathize with JP, and can see the reason he turned out like he did, but I don't think in real life he would've just opened up like he did only to become a real piece of shit. It just didn't seem like that was in his character.",

        "text": "Most people are taking Tar to be about a horrible person who abuses their power sexually, however I believe there is a defense to be made of Lydia.\n\nTo me Lydia THOUGHT she was in control of everyone, but really so many people were also using her. Early in the movie we see Mark Strong's character being a weasley \"pretty please let me look at your notes\" type of guy trying to leech on her talent. Then take the example of Olga. There is no sign in the movie she is actually into Lydia or a lesbian, in fact later she is dissing her in text messages. It's as likely that Olga is intentionally charming Lydia to move up as the latter being in control, and loses interest as soon as Lydia starts to become radioactive. There's Francesca, who the split with Lydia comes primarily for career reasons when she doesn't get the assistant conductor spot she thought she was owed. Much like Olga, we see her talking some shit on text messages earlier in the move. How do we know that Francesca wasn't trying to play Lydia or her breakdown state after Krista's death wasn't an attempt to get in with her sexually to guarantee her spot? Then the biggest gut punch to Lydia is Sharon. It's revealed at the end she barely even cares about the cheating really, she just didn't want the other ramifications that would come out of this scandal, and she points out to Lydia that their relationship is in fact \"transactional\". Sharon still being with her, might have had more to do with giving her the primo spot in the orchestra than Lydia thought. In regards to Krista she seemed most pissed at Lydia not helping her career wise anymore. Lydia telling everyone that she's unstable was probably true.\n\nThe whole orchestra world seems to be a complete shark tank. Everyone is obsessed with rising their status, most don't have the talent of Lydia so they have to be to get ahead. Lydia went around just thinking wow another girl in class made eye contact with me, it must be cause I'm so awesome, without realizing it was actually really transactional and hollow. The masseuse moment at the end makes her sick cause she has another one of those eye contact moments but is now aware of it now that it could all be bullshit and turn out the masseuse is just a musician who knows exactly who she is. Now she can't really trust anyone like that again. In reality Lydia is emotionally unavailable making it difficult for anyone to really love her, except for her daughter, and she ran away from the place where she could be Linda instead of Lydia and people might actually understand her. \n\nThe \"humiliating\" ending is actually healthy for Lydia by checking her ego for once, and by having to wear the headphones and having less control than she usually does. She got away from the sharks in the US and can now rebuild something new.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/z0kf5f/uncovering_the_musical_references_in_tár/",
        "text": "This post came about when I was trying to compile a list of all of the tiny details I noticed and appreciated as a musician watching Tár. Two pieces play central roles in the film: Mahler’s Symphony No. 5 and Elgar’s Cello Concerto. In addition, there is a reference to the Rite of Spring early on. The Rite is an easy piece to reference because of its place in the popular imagination, but as the film progresses, it turns out the Rite foreshadows everything to come. I hope this will be meaningful for those who have seen the film and might be wondering about some of the musical references. Spoilers from here on out, as well as mention of suicide.\n\nAt the beginning, during the New Yorker interview event, Tar talks about the 11 “gunshots” in The Rite of Spring. (You can hear them at 24:16 in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP42C-4zL3w&amp;ab\\_channel=Cmaj7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rP42C-4zL3w&amp;ab_channel=Cmaj7)). She says these are the notes that made her realize anyone is capable of murder. So let’s talk about the piece.\n\nThe Rite of Spring is a ballet by Igor Stravinsky, written in 1913. It is one of the three major ballets he wrote for the Ballet Russes in Paris, the others being Firebird and Petrushka. It was choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky, one of the principal male dancers of the Ballet Russes, who had performed the title role in Petrushka. As an aside, Nijinsky was at one point the lover of Sergei Diaghilev, the impresario who founded the Ballet Russes. The Rite of Spring depicts an imaginary pagan ritual involving the sacrifice of a young maiden. Nijinsky’s choreography famously eschewed the conventions of classical dance. Stravinsky was famously very frustrated by Nijinsky’s seeming disregard for the music. Likewise, the conductor at the premiere, Pierre Monteux, despised the music and conducted the piece reluctantly. The Joffrey Ballet reconstructed something close to the original choreography, referencing Nijinsky’s notes from the original production. I’ll direct you to just watch it instead of trying to describe it in words: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF1OQkHybEQ&amp;ab\\_channel=FatovaMingus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jF1OQkHybEQ&amp;ab_channel=FatovaMingus)\n\nI’ll reference this synopsis of the Rite from wikipedia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Rite\\_of\\_Spring#Synopsis\\_and\\_structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_of_Spring#Synopsis_and_structure)\n\nThe moment in question is the 11/4 bar that comes at the end of “Mystic Circles of the Young Girls,” just before “The Glorification of the Chosen One.” It happens here: (at 8:42 in part 2: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1t0pCchxM&amp;t=0s&amp;ab\\_channel=FatovaMingus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH1t0pCchxM&amp;t=0s&amp;ab_channel=FatovaMingus)). It’s the moment that one of the girls is chosen to be sacrificed. Following this, “the young girls invoke the ancestors,” then “the chosen one is entrusted to the care of the the old wise men.” The ballet ends with the chosen one dancing herself to death before the old men.\n\nWe can start to see parallels between this synopsis and some of the themes of the film. There are many instances in which Tár is involved in “choosing,” whether it’s for her Accordion initiative or for her orchestra. We also find out that earlier, Tár must have gone through the same process to earn her position at the Berlin Philharmonic. What is unclear is the specific roles which each character plays in the sacrificial process. We might think that Krista Scott is the sacrifice, since she commits suicide, but this does not quite work. She commits suicide because she is *not chosen*. Instead, I believe the chosen one is meant to be Tár herself, the lone girl to be recognized, placed before the pantheon of old men (conductors, composers, orchestra musicians) and left to dance herself to death. Only her death isn’t literal; it’s an ego death. Recall her words to the Juilliard student: “you must sublimate yourself.”\n\nTo me, the film intentionally plays with gender. Blanchett and Field have spoken about how Tár being a woman changes and nuances the story. It is not maleness that is the cause of her manipulative behavior, but power. All the same, she is fitting into a very gendered role- at the beginning she acknowledges that musicians are “aggressively typecast.” As the film progress, the allegorical roles in the Rite change. While Tár might herself be the chosen one, she herself also evolves into the old men that do the choosing and preside over the ritual. The ritual of power is thus cyclical, not ending with her but continuing even in her absence.\n\nThis first scene makes other important references; first, to Jean-Baptiste Lully. While the story she tells is apocryphal, if we take it at face value, it’s about a tyrannical conductor who stabs himself in the foot, killing himself. Next, Alma Mahler- the wife of Gustav Mahler who had a series of affairs and re-marriages. She’s a controversial figure, as hinted at in the film, because of varying viewpoints on her relationship to Mahler and the claims she made about his music. Cyclical betrayal becomes a theme as well, as Tár gives in to her paranoia about various people betraying her and she, in turn, betrays others. Tár talks about Alma Mahler in the context of interpretation; while the only programmatic (music telling a story) material in the Mahler 5 manuscript is Gustav’s love for Alma, Tár says it is up to the conductor to decide the appropriate expression of that love.\n\nThere’s more: Tár is inspired by Olga’s Elgar Cello Concerto. Olga was inspired to play the piece by Jacqueline du Pré, one of the most iconic young women of classical music in the past century. Her interpretation of the piece remains the gold standard by which all other cellists play it, and her legacy is surrounded by tragedy. She and Daniel Barenboim made up a classical music power couple that commanded a Beatles-like fandom, but it was short lived. Du Pré suffered from Multiple Sclerosis and gave her last concerto performance (playing the Elgar) at 28; she died 14 years later. Barenboim, controversially, was present until her death but also had an affair with the woman who would later be his second wife. Perhaps it is reading too deeply into it, but this once again reinforces the theme of a young woman being betrayed. This comes in the film as Tár’s wife is increasingly suspicious of her motivations and extramarital activities.\n\nWell hopefully some of this is meaningful to someone out there! There’s a lot more folklore and I’m sure there are references that I missed. It should be noted that not everything in the film was totally accurate (a Juilliard student who doesn’t know Bach? Come on.) but overall I was incredibly impressed with the film and especially with the writing, which somehow captured so well so much of the classical music world that is invisible to the public eye.",

If you would like to see the illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/wakanda-for-sale/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/wakanda-for-sale/)\n\n*Wakanda Forever* is now in theaters. It’s the much anticipated sequel to Disney/Marvel’s 2018 blockbuster ***Black Panther***, which grossed 1.3 billion dollars. \n\nA film, or any endeavor, is fundamentally changed when it involves enough money to fund a major city’s school system. Disney isn’t going to put the potential for billion-dollar profits in the hands of some director and just ask him to do his best. Making giant scale blockbusters is a carefully controlled process designed to maximize a return on the corporation’s investment. \n\nBefore *Wakanda Forever* was even released, it was already put to work pulling in capital. It was used to sell Sprite*,* Lexuses*,* plastic dolls, silk ties, a new line of makeup, watches, Lego, hoodies, sneakers, posters, costumes, backpacks, key chains, fanny packs, jewelry, T-shirts, there were even Wakanda apps for sale. *Wakanda Forever* was featured in commercials for Mastercard and Target, and no one had seen the movie yet. It was an unknown entity, but its fame was already marketable. When Taylor Swift puts her name on a perfume bottle, it boosts sales, because her fans admire her and want a product associated with her. The unreleased *Wakanda Forever* was a blank place-holder for a movie that was yet to be seen, but it was already salable. It’s as if the specifics of the movie and the story it told were less important than the brand it symbolized. In semiotic terms, the film is secondary to the sign it generates. The signifier is the film itself, but it has been severed from what it signifies. Stranger still, the sign is not an image, but a reference to a narrative. Any part of the narrative can be clipped out of its context and used to sell anything. Eventually, signifier and signified float independently like incomplete molecules waiting to bond with whatever is receptive. Shown below is a sweater that brings together several signifiers. There is the “*Wakanda Forever*” text, which is split in two by the the Wu-tang Clan’s logo, both of which have been pixelated to look like a handmade Christmas sweater. \n\nThe sweater becomes a sign that conflates a movie about superheroes in an African utopia, an old-school rap group from Staten Island, and a symbol of Christmas and family. Trying to bring all these symbols together only compromises their integrity. Each time each symbol is paired with a non-sequitur, the link behind signifier and signified is weakened.\n\nBy the time you get to the theater and sit down with your *Wakanda Forever* branded popcorn and your *Wakanda Forever* jumbo-sized soft drink, the meaning of the narrative you are prepared to watch has already been hijacked a dozen times over. \n\nFilm is an art form, and as such it occupies a unique position in our culture. The art world generates the most valuable objects in the world. Leonardo da Vinci’s painting of Salvator Mundi sold for 497.8 million dollars. Willem de Kooning’s painting *Interchange* sold for 343 million. There are no other objects in the world that cost as much. There is no car, house, jewel, or airplane that even costs half that. Only art can generate such astronomically priced objects. \n\nOnce a painting is valued at almost half a billion dollars, it ceases to be a painting. It can no longer be seen as such. Its value nullifies its purpose. When some oligarch spends hundreds of millions of dollars on a painting, it isn’t going to hang over his couch. It will be sealed in a light-tight, climate-controlled vault where it will never be seen again, until it is time to resell it. Even if said oligarch deigned to display his pricey piece of merchandise, it would still be hard to see it through the fog of capitalist celebrity that has been attached to it.\n\n*Wakanda Forever* only costs 20 dollars to see, but its billion dollar value has already transformed it. The entire process from conception to finished product is permeated by the need to create monetary value, which leaves little room for anything other than mass appeal. *Wakanda Forever* is not the only film that undergoes this process and transformation. It is true for all large-scale films. *Wakanda Forever* is just an extreme example. The more money that is put into a movie, the less likely it is to be anything other than a means to recoup that money.\n\n*Waknada Forever* is a sea of associations around black history, race and identity. There is an effort made to promote diversity and to provide African-American role models. Both *Black Panther* films manage to provide some measure of this, but once these messages are attached to a *McDonald's* Happy Meal and handed to a consumer by an underpaid African-American worker in McDonald's uniform, the message is muddied. Add to the mix that the “free” toy inside was made by an underpaid worker in Vietnam, and everything gets muddier still.  \n\nThe little free doll may be one unit in an endless line of units that the factory spits out, but it can also become a vehicle for developing a child’s identity. It can be another step in the effort to raise up the image of black people, it can provide a role model, but most likely it will be a toy that provides a short-lived thrill for a child who will play with it for a few minutes, and then relegate it to a pile of similar objects gathering dust under the couch. A year or two later, it will end up in a landfill or clogging the digestive track of a whale. The few that avoid the trash heap will eventually be auctioned off on Ebay as valuable totems from the past. The dolls, like the film they are from, are positioned and repositioned as salable products, while their meaning is clipped off and left behind.\n\nThe more money is attached to something, the more difficult it is for that thing to maintain an identity. We would never ask how much a human being is worth because we instinctively know that once a price is attached to something, it is changed. The same is true for film and for the arts in general.\n\nThe night before I wrote this article, I went to see a movie in the theaters. Before the trailers, there were 5 or 6 ads. One was for the new model of Rolex watch called “*The Cinema*.” The ad was one minute long, but managed to summarize the history of cinema with millisecond clips culled from classic films. Interspersed between the clips were glamour shots of the watch. The last clip was from *Amelie*. The close-up shot of her in a movie theater watching a film. Then they cut to the watch and the narrator says, “This is cinema.”\n\nThe montage jumps back and forth between film clips and images of the watch, as if they were trying to hypnotically link the two. Then, once the link has been established, we see a quick shot of Amelie, who represents us the audience, staring at the screen, and then all the film clips disappear and are replaced with the watch and the logo, while we are told that the watch is cinema.  We are coaxed into confusing the two unrelated things; a watch and the history of a medium. The watch is transformed from a means of telling time into a whole world of images and meaning. Once transformed, the consumer is no longer paying $100,000 for a machine worth a small fraction of the price, they are buying a cultural symbol of romance, history and affluence. \n\nThis transformation is reminiscent of the myth of King Midas. Whatever he touched lost its identity. It was no longer what it was. Once an object or person is gold, its only function is to be a stand-in for currency. Before *Wakanda Forever* ever hit the screen, Midas was already working his magic.",

Not too long, not too short. Possibly ideal for any film?\n\n\\-Use of deep focus whenever possible. He didn't seem to like to have the background blurred outside of close-ups.\n\n\\-Use of master shots/two-shots. He tended to cut to a close-up in an important part of a dialogue scene, do shot-reverse-shot for a while, and then cut back to a wider two-shot.\n\n\\-Paying a lot of attention to the composition of each shot. Was any director better than him at this?\n\n\\-Editing his own films, for all intents and purposes. He didn't let editors much freedom, if any.\n\n\\-Relative avoidance of long takes. There are some examples of him using long takes, like Danny's tricycle sequence on The Shining, but in general, Kubrick stayed away from long takes.\n\nFeel free to add your own observation on Kubrick's visual style.",

        "text": " I was scrolling on the subreddit when a post caught my attention. It said “Cinema is dead, convince me otherwise”. My response to the post was “Nope”. But the post intrigued many thoughts which compelled me to revisit the film today. Hence, to write about it.\n\nSometimes we take things for granted about cinema. As a matter of fact it changes gradually with intermediate intervention of technology. One thing about Cinema has changed due to technology is the social aspect of it. Cinema used to be communal, today most of the cinema viewing experience has become personal on highly personalised and so called smart devices. We are waiting for more disruption and eruptions to see.\n\nSo, Nope is an important film in this context. It starts with the mention of a gift in the hands of the chimp. We share our DNA with the chimps. Have we turned our eyes towards violence with the gift of technology we have? Will we ever depart from the animalistic instincts we look down upon?\n\nJordan Peele has this amazing style of storytelling. His story stands strong with unusual incidents with unusual coincidences. There is a shoe standing straight right in the middle of the frame, while human nature at the left interacts with the animalistic nature on the right. Who is standing in who’s shoes? And what is worth the applause? What do we collectively put value into? Are the big questions presented further. Interestingly, the right side of our brain is the creative brain and the left is logical. The occurrence of Jordan’s craft taunts the social fabric and the balance between civilisation and beautification of our society. Parity or Inclusiveness? Chimpanzee dresses like an urban man, and human lying still like a hunted animal. Surrealismo.\n\nThis beginning of the film sets the premise for the audience. In many ways Jordan Peele is a master of establishing his own grammar and rules for his stories. He brings the audience a journey to bite into the content until barebones of the subject are visible. Which denotes the references from Eadweard Muybridge’s moving images as the inception of Cinema. We have come a long way to seek answers in intangible and finding meanings between the lines. Roads we have built on the pathways of the past.",

        "text": "If you didn't know, a brand new 'Saw' film is releasing next October, which will be bringing back 'Jigsaw' aka actor Tobin Bell. Apparently it's supposed to take place around the time of the first 'Saw' film in 2004, and should be more simplistic and psychological, instead of the torture-laden sequels that favored gore over story and the psychological elements of the first 2 films!\n\nThis all sounds like a great approach, and I'm excited/curious, but my only concern is the writing team. Quick side-story; in 2017 we had our first reboot of the franchise, called 'Jigsaw' and it was written by Josh Stolberg and Pete Goldfinger... two writers I had never heard of.  \n\nA quick iMDB search shows they wrote films like 'Piranha' and 'Sorority Row', and not much else.\n\nI went into 'Jigsaw' with an open mind and excitement, only to be let down by such a poorly written, stale movie. It was very average, paint-by-numbers. The movie failed critically and did not receive any sequel; the last thing you want for a film that was supposed to jumpstart the franchise again after being dormant for SEVEN years! \n\nA few years passed, and in 2021 we received yet ANOTHER reboot, this time called 'Spiral' starring Chris Rock and featuring Sam Jackson! \n\nYet to my surprise, Stolberg and Goldfinger were brought back AGAIN as writers... why would the studios do that? Why take a chance on the same writers who failed to prove themselves? \n\nNonetheless, I was still curiously excited. The trailers looked great, and the plot synopsis was intriguing!... yet this was another dud, even worse than 'Jigsaw'. \n\nThis film, like 'Jigsaw', also did not receive any sequel to do being critically unsuccessful with the general audience and fans of the franchise alike. \n\nSo now, here we are in 2022, and a new Saw film is back, Jigsaw the character is back for the first time since 2017, and yet the studios decided to bring back the SAME writers as the last TWO FAILED REBOOTS....??? I'm completely dumbfounded why they would do this.   \n\nAs much as I'm going to be curious and excited about this movie, history shows it's only going to be a very poorly written movie. \n\nAnyone else care to chime in? I'd love to hear your thoughts.  [Saw 10 - Tobin Bell Will Return in Brand New 2023 Sequel Movie!

        "text": "Before Asghar Farhadi became recognized as the auteur of Iranian cinema, Mohammed Reza Aslani wrote and directed The Chess of the Wind, which was a layered critique of Iranian society. The film was released during the final years of the Pahlavi monarchy, which was reflective of the widespread corruption beneath a veneer of progress. \n\nIt has been considered by many critics to be the Holy Grail of Iranian cinema, as while it was unpopular during its release, critics who have seen it have recognized its cinematic excellence. It has been considered a lost masterpiece until a few years back when a copy was discovered in a thrift shop.\n\nMartin Scorsese, as one of the founding members of the World Cinema Project, initiated a painstaking restoration of the film. Two years ago, it was selected as an Official Cannes Classics film and shown during the festival. \n\nThe director, Aslani, has been recognized more for his documentaries and excursions in experimental cinema. I myself only stumbled upon this film, when after looking for classic films to watch, this was suggested in a list. As a fan of chess, and especially with the history surrounding this film's resurrection, I simply had to watch it. \n\nThe movie begins silently, even laconically. It seems that the family matriarch had just passed without properly designating inheritors, and there is rankling animosity among those surviving. The stepfather has assumed the reins of the house, even though the inheritance was left to the matriarch's crippled daughter. What follows is a complex period drama of people competing for the inheritance.\n \nThe set pieces are excellent: even without speech, the film shows that they are clearly affluent, with the crippled lady of the house having a beautifully designed wheelchair. \n\nThe film's restoration was splendid: the distinct colors emphasize the complex interplay of light and shadows in the film. It is so intricately filmed, with Azlani paying much attention to details. The color scheme was also well-implemented. \n\nThis film was indeed clairvoyant, tackling the same feminist themes that Iranian women are fighting for today. It is actually surprising how upfront Azlani addresses sexual themes without being overly explicit. In a patriarchy like Iran, the film is indeed ahead of its time, putting a spotlight on those marginalized by Iranian society then and now. \n\nThe women in this film are embattled by the more powerful men out to get the daughter's inheritance. The dynamic between the lady and the maidservant reminds me of the dynamic in Park Chan-wook's Handmaiden, with how they try to protect each other (and, subsequently, outwit each other, as well). \n\nI must admit, there are dull moments in the film, but the climax was executed beautifully, tying all the threads together and at the same time revealing that avarice ultimately leaves no victors. It's a beautifully shot film that takes patience, but is rewarding with its sharp critique on society.\n\nI'd have rated it 3/5, but I admire the way the film culminated. Everyone is complicit, but no one escapes unscathed. \n\n8.5/10",

Then go to the post office and send a telegram.”\n\nHowever, I am having a hard time actually finding the source of this comment. The only relevant sources I found were an article written in 2000 where director Abbas Kiarostami quotes it(https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/you-want-to-send-a-message-go-to-the-post-office-701728.html?amp ) and a 1997 article where a journalist quotes the same comment(https://www.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/1997/07/23/1997072370511.html?outputType=amp).\n\nI know that Bernardo Bertolucci said “I don't film messages. I let the post office take care of those.” in a 2004 interview with msnbc, but I guess this is also a paraphrased version of Truffaut’s comment…?\n\nDoes anyone know the actual source of this comment? Did Truffaut even say anything that remotely resembles this comment?\n\nThank you for reading.",

The Coen's \"Barton Fink\" seems to really draw on this style, especially near the end. I know there was a big shift in cinema in the 60's with the rise of the method acting but if I could pin it down to one thing, it is a big change in the time and style of delivering their lines. Actors started actually speaking like real people, taking pauses and listening to what the other person was saying before delivering their line.",

This is the face that he puts on when they’re first dating and is whom she falls in love with. The movie that they’re starring in together represents the illusion of love and happiness.

She never sees this side until the very end when he tries to kill her. However, he showed this side to other women. When he traveled through Europe, he raped and murdered multiple prostitutes. Those prostitutes are who Laura interacts with in the house. Laura herself is not actually a prostitute, but he treats her like one. She is no better than them in his mind. Also, the women in scenes from other countries are his previous victims.\n\nEventually, Laura dies and joins countless other victims. She never was an actress. She only dreamed of being one.

The fact that the movie starts and ends in the film set (\"*In and out*\") refers, in my opinion, to the fact that the spectator chose to believe that what is watching is simultaniously fiction and reality. He knows that is fiction, but he pretend that what he see is real, not just some actors that recite a script inside some costumes in an expensive cinepatograhic set.  \n\n\nLib, the protagonist, is a woman that lost his daughter, but pretends that she is the mother of Nan, who in turn is Anna that pretends to be a new girl after her \"death\". Both of the women *are* what they think, in their minds.   \nAlso, the nun told Lib about an angel in a horse that run away with Anna, but she knows that is someone who took her away from his family, and we understand this when she ask to Lib if Anna will be fine (or in a safe place, I don't remember). Or for example the medic, that deeply knows that Anna is starving, but wants to believe that is a miracle beyond science, like Anna's mother that wants to believe in the miracle also if he know that is a cheat (that herslef is perpetrating). She pretend it so much that continues to believe also after she has been exposed.  \nA lot say that this is a movie about religious faith and its fanatism, but in my opinion is reductive. For me this is a film about the faith in a broader sense, with the meaning of deeply believe in something despite facts that also the believer know.  \n\n\nWhat do you think about that? Did you have the same feelings and thought after watching the movie?",

        "text": "The director does a great job of making the viewer tense from the start, but the entire first hour literally is a day in the life of a conductor. It sets up the theme of \"what's going on in an artists life when they're creating a great work\" (love or loss, or did they do bad things in the past, or who knows?), but it also feels mundane.\n\nAlright, any conductor knows a professional string player wouldn't take their million dollar instrument down into an extremely wet, dripping basement. That's a major flaw in the script. Is our lead character going mad? Is she being stalked? Is the dog Linda Tarr, past SA victims, or is a dog just a dog? We never find out. We never even find out if Lydia *is* a Kevin Spacey. Maybe that's the point. Then the whole imposter syndrome \"Linda\" thing... are we supposed to ask ourselves if we feel sympathy for an accused (but never confirmed) predator if they overcame great odds to get where they are (another Kevin Spacey similarity)? What if she really is innocent and is just a casualty of the #metoo movement after rising up from the depths of Linda Tarr.\n\nIn the penultimate big scene, we do learn our lead strongly draws the line at child rape (with the sex workers ham-fistedly set up in a \"*fish* bowl\" to resemble an orchestra, beating the viewer over the head with the obvious symbolism) because our lead runs out to puke. Then she conducts **Monster** Hunter to an audience dressed in fur suits, clearly an embarrassing gig for such an elite artist and an epic fall from grace.\n\nIn total, as a piece of art, TÁR is one. It also features stunning visuals. The story and the lack of full resolution at the end was annoying, but if that's what the director was going for, hey. What if sometimes in life we never know the answer to something. The film is so tense for so long, then by the end you've got Petra behind the curtain and you know it can't be a haunted child picture, then Lydia goes berserk at the concert but she doesn't end up going full on mad, then the imposter syndrome thing, then you're looking at your watch and see you've got 5 minutes left and where is this thing going? Then brothel, concert, and you're left with a lot of unanswered questions... much like, from Act I, what was Mahler's 5th really about? Earlier we see that Lydia has chosen to name her composition after the dead Krista and then she's interrupted, and in Act I we learn that Mahler's wife's name was the only insight into the composition and meaning of his 5th, which Lydia was supposed to famously conduct. Did the music drive her mad?\n\nAnother aspect of this film is having the viewer see images in mirrors (symbolism: we're seeing what's going on but not really), and having them read emails and websites on computer screens ( symbolism: like how musicians read music that others wrote in the past). In one sequence we see that Lydia was warned by several people to not accept Krista into her program because of her unstable behavior. So why does she? Why would Krista be so obsessed with Lydia if there was no affair? So much is left to the viewer to decide, and the individual must rely on their interpretation of what they saw to decide what meaning the piece has. TÁR is really a bit of an adult choose your own adventure Lynchian nightmare. So Linda Tarr became overachiever Lydia Tár and hiding from her former self caused her to be more comfortable with the secret and the hidden: hence the inappropriate relationships and manipulating others through sex? Who knows?",

        "text": "This article has a lot of colorful film stills. For a fully illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/wenzel-storchs-bizarre-journey-into-bliss/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/wenzel-storchs-bizarre-journey-into-bliss/)\n\n In 2004, German artist Wenzel Storch wrote, directed, filmed, and produced *A Journey Into Bliss* or *Die Reise ins Glück*. For some critics, this raises suspicion that the film was a “vanity project”, and it may well have been. However, there is an upside to such endeavors. A film made by a singular vision is uniquely able to explore all the idiosyncratic nooks and crannies of one author’s mind. It becomes a vehicle for a particularly personal expression.  \n\nA  *Journey into Bliss* is most certainly idiosyncratic. It’s pathologically idiosyncratic. It’s an absurd, delusional fairytale costume drama set in what I would term a “steamjunk” universe. Steamjunk being the ragged and rusty stepchild of steampunk. The steamjunk aesthetic is mostly seen in the elaborate sets, which are the best part of the film. They are cramped constructions littered with decaying refuse and brightly colored cloth that jut out, wrap around, and tangle around everyone on screen. The whole film is shot through an extremely wide angle lens, adding to the nightmarish warp.\n\nThe plot is as jumbled as the sets. I think I may have sensed some references to Shakespeare’s *The Tempest*, and maybe *Alice in Wonderland*, but overall, *Journey Into Bliss* is just a loosely built chronology that provides a wobbly association between scenes. It is certainly influenced by Guy Madden, but Madden wouldn’t include Nazis and rape and giant bursts of semen into his films, whereas Storch does.\n\nDue to the random nature of the film, it’s easier to simply describe a few scenes than summarize the plot or provide meaningful context. \n\nOrdered by Gustav (the captain of the giant snail ship), a grizzly bear (played by a real grizzly bear) gets out of his bubble bath and defends the ship by shooting starfish shuriken at the king’s henchman, who is attacking the ship while dressed as a giraffe.\n\nIn another scene, a giant cyborg bunny rabbit with light-up eyes has sex with a birdcage, which turns the bunny into a time machine.\n\nThe “climax” of the film comes when the snail ship is brought to life by a stew of fermented strawberries. The concoction drives the ship mad with lust, causing it to rape a church. The building is flooded with semen, producing a second time machine which takes Captain Gustav back to the beginning of the movie, where the film ends.\n\n That sounds like fun doesn’t it? To some degree it is, but there are also some troubling scenes that play around with things like blackface, swastikas, and urine, lots of urine. If you are going to juggle dangerous imagery, you need to know what you are doing. Such imagery can be a potent way to interrogate difficult issues, or it can be an unfortunately misguided attempt at throwing stuff around for simple shock value. *A Journey Into Bliss* does a little of both. \n\n It  is visually rich, and the production crew must have had a great time, unless that was all done by Storch too. There are some interesting clusters of absurdity and humor, but as a whole, the film is weak. There is a lot of vague satire that doesn’t hit any particular target, and so loses its purpose. It’s an aggressively transgressive film, but some of its defiance isn’t backed up with enough substance. It’s definitely creative and unpredictable, but in the end, it’s more strange than truly interesting .",

        "text": "Munich begins with the murder of eleven Israeli athletes and coaches at the 1972 Munich Olympics.  The Israeli government responds by assembling a group to track and kill eleven Palestinian terrorists who are considered responsible for the attack.  Avner Kaufman, a sensitive Mossad agent played by Eric Bana, leads this group of five, which includes a driver, bomb maker, document forger, and cleaner.  \n\nThis could be the setup for an uncomplicated movie depicting a globetrotting, Ocean’s Eleven-esque crew eliminating terrorists with pinache, but the director, Steven Spielberg, does not take that route.  The Israelis did not seek justice for the murder of the olympic athletes, but rather revenge, and the price for that is stated by Robert, the bombmaker, after successfully killing several terrorists: \n\nWe’re Jews, Avner.  Jews don’t do wrong because our enemies do wrong…  We’re supposed to be righteous.  That’s a beautiful thing.  That’s Jewish.  That’s what I knew.  That’s what I was taught.  And now I’m losing it, Avner.  I lose that, I lose everything.  That’s my soul. \n\nSpielberg reveals the appalling nature of the reprisal killings, which he argues are antithethical to Jewish identity, by depicting the targeted Palestinian terrorists as people and not just caricatures, not just targets to be knocked down.  \n\nThe group’s first target is Wael Zwaiter.  He is a poet living in Rome, translating One Thousand and One Nights into Italian.  He gives a talk to a small, appreciative group at a cafe and tells self-deprecating jokes about how little money his book will make.  He wears suspenders, a paisley tie, and a toothy grin.  We see him stop for groceries at a little Italian bodega where he’s on a first name basis with the lady behind the counter.  He gets shot repeatedly by Avner and Robert, the bomb maker, when he enters the foyer of his apartment building.  Bullets and his falling body shatter a bottle of milk that he had just bought, mixing with the wine he was also carrying.  Perhaps the corruption of the milk signifies the corruption of Avner’s soul.\n\nMahmoud Hamshari is the second target.  Pretending to be a reporter, Robert goes to Hamshari’s home office in Paris and sizes his phone for a bomb.  What we know about Hamshari is that he is a doting father.  His daughter, wearing a Matilda-style school uniform, returns home unexpectedly and is almost blown up by Avner’s group.  Hamshari gives her a peck on the cheek, says something endearing to her in French--possibly the last thing he ever says to her--and she runs off.      \n\nHussein Al Bashir is the third target.  Robert plants a bomb in the bed of his hotel room, and Avner waits in the room next door to signal when Al Bashir is in position.  Before this happens, Al Bashir comes out to the balcony and hilariously commiserates with Avner on their shared fate of having in the next room an exhibitionist, newlywed couple who will be having very loud sex throughout the night.  He even charitably offers Avner a sleeping pill.\n\n\nNext, three Palestinian terrorists are killed in a raid by Israeli commandos with Avner’s group tagging along.  There’s an exciting bit of cross dressing and lots of shooting.  These scenes serve as a contrast to the other killings because these terrorists are portrayed as nothing but combatants, and there is no intimacy in these killings.\n\nZaid Muchassi is the final Palestinian terrorist the group successfully kills.  Avner’s group is double booked in an Athens safehouse with PLO members.  Just like in Barbarians, they are wary of each other at first, but after a Mexican standoff is defused and the two rival groups have a cute fight over the radio that ends with them choosing an Al Green love song as common ground, I am ready to ship them.  Avner and Ali, a leader of the group, smoke cigarettes in the stairwell and debate the Israeli/Palestinian conflict long into the night like the most obnoxious college students.  Ali is both optimistic about the fate of Palestine and fatalistically prepared to stand first in the line of generations of Palestinians who will sacrifice their lives for the cause.  (“We have a lot of children. They’ll have children.  So we can wait forever.”)  We don’t know much about Zaid Muchassi, but Ali is his emotional proxy.  Avner’s group shoots him because he was with Muchassi at the time of his assassination.\n\nThe only one who doesn’t get this humanizing treatment is Ali Hassan Salameh, the organizer of the Munich Massacre.  He is portrayed only as a terrorist.  He is wealthy, well-dressed, and surrounded by henchmen.  He is also the one who gets away, at least in the timeframe of the movie.  We are told that he is eventually killed later on.  He is presented as the mastermind behind the Munich Massacres, and, as such, Spielberg reframes from highlighting any humanity he may possess.  \n\nUltimately, what Avner and his group experience is meant to apply to Israel itself.  Seeking revenge for the murder of Israeli athletes was unjust:  the murder of the terrorists (the poet, the father, the fellow traveler, and the freedom fighter) is little different from the murder of the Olympic athletes.  The killing of such men, regardless of their own crimes or the Jewish lives that may have ultimately been saved, extracts a heavy toll on the murderers and the country that empowered them.  With the killings, Israel lost its righteousness, an important aspect of Jewish identity.  And for what?  As Avner states, the terrorists were quickly replaced by other men, and Israel was made no safer.",

        "text": "I have been subscribed to MUBI for several years now. Long before I knew about the Criterion Channel, or most of the dozens of boutique blu-ray companies that now saturate the market, it was my source of films that were off the beaten track, that you would not find on more commercial streaming services like Netflix. Thankfully, even after many years, and many more subscriptions to niche streaming services, MUBI still finds away to surprise by presenting me not only with a film I had never heard of before, but with a filmmaker. Step right up, Monsieur Guy Gilles. \n\nFrom the limited information I can find on Guy Gilles we can place him in the midst of the French New Wave, but ostensibly outside of the established camps of the Cahiers crew, and those pesky Left Bankers. He was not an outsider from the movement in the same way more commercial (by comparison) filmmakers like Henri-Georges Clouzot and Jean-Pierre Melville were, however. It is simply a case where nobody at the time took notice of his films, and they have become somewhat lost to time. This is where MUBI comes in, as they have luckily made three of Gilles’ films available to stream: *Love at Sea* (1964), *Wall Engravings* (1968), and *Earth Light* (1970). Each film uniquely presents the viewer with a glimpse into the life of the ordinary told through fragmented quick cuts, mixed-format photography, and a deep sense of melancholy. \n\nIn *Love at Sea*, we follow a romance troubled by distance and disconnection. The film does not star Romy Schneider and Jean-Pierre Léaud as some sources state, they did however have cameos, but instead Daniel Moosmann and Geneviève Thénier as a marine and secretary respectively. The film takes place over the course of a year, beginning in the summer when the couple can be together, and then the following months where their separation causes them to question their relationship. Daniel contemplates his commitment to Geneviève, while she longingly remembers moments from their past, of happier times. This theme of distanced love and memory is continued in *Wall Engravings*, which follows Macha Méril as Jeanne who spends the film reminiscing about her beau, Jean, played by Patrick Jouané - possibly Gilles’ muse, who with his scarred nose and vulnerability looks like a French James Dean. For Jeanne, the film is an exercise in keeping the memory of one’s love alive and burning until they are together again, for the audience though it is a much more wistful experience as we learn early in the film that Jean has passed away. \n\nBoth *Love at Sea*, and *Wall Engravings* embrace a creative decision surrounding the contrasting use of black-and-white and colour photography. In these films, Gilles sees the world of the present tense as incredibly serious, like Antonioni he uses black-and-white photography to exaggerate the striking lines and walls of the modern world, everything in these scenes is clearly defined. The world of memories however is more magical, and he presents these scenes in beautiful colour. The two films do not use this idea identically however. In *Love at Sea*, what is a memory and what is a dream, or a hope, is less clearly defined, whereas in *Wall Engravings*, moments representing memories are much more succinct. *Wall Engravings* is perhaps the more grounded of the two films bound by longing and sadness. To more clearly define the differences between the two pictures that sound similar in theory I would describe *Love at Sea* as a more Malickian experience, whereas *Wall Engravings* would be more reminiscent of the works of Wong Kar-wai. \n\nThematically, *Earth Light* is quite different from *Love at Sea*, and *Wall Engravings*. We follow Pierre (Patrick Jouané once again), a “man of nowhere”, as he becomes restless with his life in Paris and decides to travel to his birthplace in Tunisia in order to feel closer to his mother who died when he was a child. The film is not romantic in the conventional sense in that there is no central love story, but it does hold that dreamy, lovelorn atmosphere. Unlike the other two films, this one is shot fully in colour, and has an editing style that is arguably even more frantic. \n\nThe editing of the films is not incredibly unlike the work of his contemporaries, in particular Jean-Luc Godard, and Agnes Varda, but rather than being chaotic as a vulgar display of power over the cinematic form in the case of Godard, Gilles seems to use this in a much more natural way. The jumps and fragments of scenes that pop up in near constant waves is symbolic of how our own consciousness perceives time and space. When we remember something the real world doesn’t dissolve and a perfect scene doesn’t suddenly play out, it merges with what we are doing and moments start and restart at random. In fact, Gilles may have made films that are as close to a stream-of-consciousness one could achieve in the cinematic form. \n\nIt is so strange to me after ruminating on these films for a few days now, how can a filmmaker so forgotten as Gilles be so close to other, more successful filmmakers in terms of style? His pictures are just as stylistically revolutionary as Alain Resnais and Francois Truffaut, but perhaps they were simply too sentimental and melancholic to gain the audience? I can’t really be sure. It also slightly baffles me how I can watch one of his films and not help but think it could have influenced aforementioned filmmakers like Kar-wai and Malick, despite the seeming lack of distribution for these films. It is a cinematic mystery, and I for one hope that MUBI’s distribution of the films now can lead to a wider appreciation of a forgotten master.",

        "text": "After hearing a lot of praise for this film for a while now, I finally got to see Triangle of Sadness. I swear y'all I'm not just some incel who only likes comic book movies but I thought this film was simply okay. I feel like I'm constantly a contrarian when it comes to critically praised films like this. I really wanted to love it but this movie constantly got in it's own way anytime it started to approach true brilliance. The one thing that hampered this film the most was the editing and the pacing. There are so many scenes that funny or meaningful but then quickly wear out their welcome because they just keep going. For instance, when the rich Russian lady wanted all of the crew to take a swim while I found the way they dragged out the scene with her actual request to resonate, the scene following that seemed to take forever. They have to inform the captain which results in a scene that is way too long. Then they need to inform the crew themselves which results in a scene that is way too long. Then we actually have to show them taking a swim which shockingly short. I'm not complaining about that scene in particular being short but we could have condensed this entire sequence from her making the request to them doing it to a brisk five minutes. The scene with the rich tech guy was largely pointless and didn't seem to tie into much of anything. If it has to be there you can trim it by a lot, but personally I checked out.\n\nThere are moments where the editing or the lack of it actually does work. My favorite scene is when the white European crew members are building up to a chant. Then we cut to the Filipino crew workers quietly bracing for the day hearing a thumping from above. We cut back to the white crew members freaking the fuck out in a Wolf of Wall Street style scene over the possibility of a big tip at the end. I thought that moment was fantastic as someone who worked in the cruise line industry for years. I thought the entire poop/vomit dinner scene and everything following that was perfect. Woody Harrelson, who gave the best performance in the film, as the wannabe every man socialist captain trading quotes with the Russian capitalist oligarch was the best part of the movie tied only with their next scene of them locked in the captain's cabin being drunk and debating philosophy. The opening scene was actually pretty great in my opinion as well although it's hard to get my gay ass to hate an opening scene with a bunch of hot young shirtless mostly white twinks. Hell if The Northman would've opened up with a bunch of shirtless young Swedish twinks I would've personally sent Robert Eggers a bouquet of roses. I also loved the scene where the two old British people get blown up by their own grenades. Was it incredibly on the nose? Yes but so was everything else about there characters and honestly the film itself by and large.\n\nOn that note, I did not mind the humor in this film in terms of style nor did I think the very blunt and in your face messaging was off-putting. This movie wears it's message on it's sleeves and if you're not jiving with it in the first ten minutes, I'd say you're in for a bad time. I would say though that there are times where we get the point the director is making but he doesn't do a whole lot with it besides repeating the same point we already just figured out, but again I'll get to act three soon. I can understand if you felt it was heavy handed because it was very heavy handed. There weren't a lot of subtle things in this film. When the director has a point to make, he very clearly tells you. I think you have even the slightest amount of political awareness you can decipher what he's getting at for most of this film. A good chunk of the time he is very creative with it. The centerpiece of the film, the vomit/poop extravaganza that brought to mind American Vandal to be honest, is the direct result of a rich privileged person having a 'great idea' and throwing off the order and flow of things because they essentially wanted to virtue signal for the benefit of no one in actuality. Because she was insistent the crew all swim, they left the food out in the open, people got sick and you get a bunch of European aristocrats tossing their cookies everywhere. You could even argue that because security was preoccupied with VomitGate that they weren't able to be on the alert for the pirates who eventually sink the ship. I loved that the only prominent American in the cast was the captain who tried to style himself as a man of the people but still had a private chef and benefitted directly from the capitalism he was so ardently vocal against. I liked the scene at the fashion show of Carl getting booted to the back of the audience so some rich people could sit up front while a screen was emblazoned with the words 'Everyone is Equal'. I liked how the Russian oligarch who was a self identified capitalist adopted socialist principles when it benefitted him. None of this stuff is particularly subtle, it's about as direct as a swift kick to the gonads. I enjoyed the inclusion of the disabled character and the commentary being made on how her wealth allowed her to live comfortable in polite society but you remove that wealth and suddenly she is at the mercy of people's kindness despite her not being able to contribute anything.\n\nI also thought there were some A+ performances in this film mostly coming from Woody Harrelson and the Russian shit seller. The casting of the rich people was on point and most of them gave some pretty great performances. It spoke so true to life for me because I worked in that exact setting for years. The scene where Carl gets petty and tattles on the one guy who was shirtless while working was very realistic to me. I've seen shit like that go down. When ole boy was getting on the mini boat to go back home, oddly enough I got choked up because I've had to say goodbye to friends in that exact same way because of something they did that while not egregious violated the sensibilites of the wealthy clientle who both expected us to be perfect customer service androids but also human enough so that they didn't feel guilty that they held so much wealth and power over us. Again the scene with the rich Russian woman and the crew member resonated so much with me because that kind of shit does happen. Maybe not to the extreme it does in the film but I've had many guests who were loaded beyond my wildest dreams try to appear egilatarian. They try to chum it up with you and make it seem like we're on the same level. I never had a guest ask me to swim but I have had some who tried to get me to drink with them while on the job or something else that would've gotten me fired pretty damn quickly as well. It always rang as funny to me because I'm making just enough to pay my rent and keep my family feed and here's this old chick who basically lives on cruise ships, some people actually do live on them year round, trying to act like we're cut from the same cloth. I didn't know a lot about this film going into it but when I saw that there was going to be some focus on the crew and how ship life is, I got excited. Having worked for Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Lines for a combination of about three years I can tell you first hand that there is A LOT of commentary you can make not only on classism but on xenophobia and racism as well.\n\nHowever this where I was also disappointed with the film because while it does go there at times I felt like the obvious commentary on race and nationality as they intersect with class wasn't made clearly enough. It's there but funnily enough that's the one area the director chose to be more subtle about. To breakdown basically what I'm talking about, on most cruise ships I've worked on those in customer facing positions like guest services, recreational director, hotel management and other 'plush' jobs tended to be from Western countries, usually European with a few Americans, Canadians and Australians tossed in every once in a while. Entertainment, which this film didn't show but is usually on most ships, are almost entirely people from Western countries as well. Security in my experience tended to be either Israeli or Indian. You needed to A) speak English in this position and B) have some kind of experience in the military, law enforcement or security for about five to ten years. Most of your cooks, maids, waiters, bellhops etc usually went to Filipinos, Indians, Indonesians, Eastern Europeans and Latin Americans. None of this is written in any book nor is it a hard and fast rule but HR does have perferences and it can vary from ship to ship. I met plenty of Black, Asian and Latino people who were in positions like guest services, finance, IT etc but they were usually American, Canadian, British and a fair amount of people from the Caribbean. There is a very strong upstairs downstairs vibe when working in this industry. I'm American and I largely worked dockside because I couldn't be away from my mom but a lot of my time was also spent on the ship as well. Because I spoke English, wore a more 'fancy' outfit and my position title sounded bougie a lot of guests treated me as if I was an equal. But the Filipino kid pushing grandma onto the gangway or the Indonesian girl who cleaned their rooms and brought them chocolate pudding at 3 o clock in the morning was very much not treated that way. Even within the crew, that hierarchy exists and it affects how people interact with each other. But you will be reminded quickly by the right customer on the wrong day that you still a rung lower than them.\n\nAll said, I thought the choice to place a large chunk of this movie on a cruise was a brilliant move. I thought the casting of Paula was truly inspired. When I tell you that I know this woman, not like the actress herself, but like the character she's playing--bro I had flashbacks. You will find a Paula on every single ship. There's always that one person who just is the job and even when shit is breaking down they keep a relatively level head about it. They are also usually always Western or Northern European although I met one who was Honduran and a couple Brazilian ones. But as great as this move was I thought that Act Two should've been the start of the film and I like a lot of the stuff that happens in Act 1. But if you start watching the movie from when they're on the ship, most of what you needed to know from Act 1 is set up and reiterated in Act 2. There should have been a lot more time fleshing out the relationships between the various sects of the crew and also the guests. Also this a slight nitpick, but I kinda wish it was on a bigger ship because the hierarchy of guests is interesting too. You'll have a Black forklift driver from Atlanta who saved up the whole damn year for this trip smoking cigars and sipping champagne with a wealthy trust fund baby from London with the former thinking they're equals despite him having a lot more in common with the Ukranian bus boy he just cussed out. The film does have shades of that with how Carl although in a position of power over the crew isn't too far removed from them because his lifestyle is largely dependent on his looks and his girlfriend. Having Act 2 be your Act 1 gives you more time to spend on the ship so when we get to Act 2, which is Act 3 in the actual film, we also have more time to spend on how the hierarchy is now flipped but in a meaningful way. I also personally would've kept more characters alive so we could have more characters to play off of. It was such a missed opportunity not to have Woody Harrelson's character survive for Act 3. They were already playing with the Russian capitalist embracing socialism when he needed it himself so I felt as if they could have really done something interesting with the captain on the island. Maybe the director felt as if the captain calling himself out as a bad socialist was enough but I would've loved to have him in Act 3.\n\nAnother reason we could've used more characters to play off of is that because outside of Paula and the Russian none of the other characters are all that interesting, to me at least. This is the part where I get downvoted into oblivion because I am just not as big of a fan of Dolly de Leon's performance as everyone else apparently is. The main thing I even heard about this film was how much of a 'revelation' she was in the third act and I was really expecting some mind-blowing shit once they got on that island. Maybe it's my fault for expecting a Viola Davis style powerhouse performance but y'all were really hyping this shit up so I went into this thinking I was gonna get something on the level of Bette Davis in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice or Angela Bassett in What's Love Got to Do With It. She was not bad by any means but I just thought she was serviceable. It's actually a rather subdued performance and I'm somewhat surprised people are reacting the way they are to it. I did like her scene where she calls out how her labor entitles her to receive the most of the profit and makes everyone recognize her as the captain. That was a great scene. Nothing else she does in the film from that point on rises above that. This is not really the fault of the actress but the script is not doing anyone any favors at this point. We spend so much time on shit that does not matter that when the movie finally reaches the finish mark we don't get an actual ending, it just stops. There was so much shit you could have cut in this last third here. The scene with the donkey? Cut it. The scene with German Groot and the Not Pirate? Cut it. Yaya and Carl's fight because of him making eyes at Abigail? Trim that shit down. The Not Pirate shaving the Russian? Cut it. The Russian being racist towards Not Pirate? You could either cut or trim it down. You'd think I'd like that scene because we are finally getting some racial commentary thrown into the film. Except this scene leads nowhere. Most of these scenes go absoultely nowhere because there is no ending that ties all of the third act and everything else in the movie together. It just ends with Carl running in the jungle looking...concerned? Excited? Scared? 'But Isaiah it's supposed to be open ended! That's what makes it so deep and layered!' Nigga we just spent two hours in 'Baby's Guide to Class Consciousness' and now you think this is the time where we should get some kind of nuance?\n\nI actually like that this film is largely as in it's face as it is outside of when it decides to be maddeningly coy. I don't mind things that are ambiguous and not spelled all the way out. But you've gotta give me something that's satisfies me in some way. I love the ending to The Sopranos and that's basically the blueprint for the ending we got here. But that ending works because if Tony died he's getting what he's been running from for years but even if he just had another peaceful dinner with his family he'll be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life. The film's ending tries to achieve something like this but it just doesn't work. Within the logic of the movie, if Abigail really doesn't want to go back to the life she had before then her killing Yaya will not accomplish that. The other survivors or hell whatever law enforcement that exists on this island will eventually find Yaya's body and that's a wrap. If she doesn't kill Yaya she could easily just stay on the island. She doesn't have any kids and she  \napparently doesn't have anything she's in a hurry to get back to. The ending falters because it doesn't finish telling the story they've be showing us. There is no resolution either of the plot or of the themes being explored here. It just stops and expects us to fill in the holes. I can do that but that doesn't mean I'm gonna be particularly enamored with your film. There's a lot of set up for a pay off never really comes. I was left with the cinematic version of blue balls.\n\nAll in all, I thought this movie had a lot of potential and there times where it lived up to this potential entirely. But the piss poor pacing undercut a lot of what it is going for. I will say that there were a few moments where the jokes/scenes went from funny to meh to please end this and looped around to absurdism which made me laugh. Vomit Fest and most scenes with Woody Harrelson and the Russian worked in this way for me. I don't think this movie is a masterpiece like many are saying but I don't think it's a bad film by any means. I do think it needed another go in the editing bay and maybe some work on the script. I give a 6/10. Now for some assorted thoughts I couldn't work into the rest of this post:\n\n\\-If we're gonna talk Oscars, and a lot of people have for this film, I think the only thing it really deserves is Woody Harrelson for Best Supporting Actor. He honestly made the movie for me and even in scenes that went on for too long he carried the film. If I'm being realistic about what it could/will get I would say that Best Original Screenplay and if Neon really campaigns their asses off then Dolly de Leon might get in for Best Supporting Actress. I'm not saying I want this but I wouldn't be upset with her nomination. Although if I'm being honest, I'd rather Angela Bassett, Stephanie Hsu or even Anya Taylor Joy for The Northman get in instead. If she gets nominated she stands a chance of winning. There is a lot of passion for this performance and her narrative would be compelling. Again I don't want this but I wouldn't be too mad because there are PLENTY of white woman who got nominated and/or won for very meh performances. I'm looking at you Laura Dern!\n\n\\-This movie felt like three different movies and I honestly wouldn't have minded full films just based on the first two acts. Like I said, I didn't know a lot about this film going into it. I didn't watch the trailers or anything outside of seeing a few seconds during a YouTube ad I pressed 'skip' on. So I really did think at first this film was gonna be about a struggling male model trying to unpack his feelings about how having a girlfriend who is much more successful than him in and industry that flips the gender hierarchy that exists in nearly every other aspect of daily life. I did not get that. Then when they are on the ship, I thought oh so we're gonna get a film about the class and racial divisions on cruise ships? I didn't get that either. Apparently all of this was leading up to the most oddest extended episode of Gilligan's Island ever.\n\n\\-There has been some backlash to how prominent the vomit/pomp fiesta was in the marketing for this film and I get it. But personally I think it makes sense because A) it's the culmination of a lot of the commentary on class they were making in it film up until that point and B) there is nothing else you could feasibly make a trailer out of that wouldn't have tricked people into thinking this was a different type of film. Too much focus on Act 1 makes you think this is going to be a romantic comedy. Too much focus on Act 3 makes you think it was some Survivor type of thing. On that note, a lot of people have also complained about how grotesque and over the top the whole scene was. Firstly, I actually think it could have been a lot more obscene. Once I got where we were going with it, I was expecting everyone's asses and mouths and to be rocketing excrement all in unison. But I also thought there was some pretty good commentary that despite how wealthy and how much these people can gloss up their appreances, at the end of the day they're still messy, burpy, shitty human beings like the rest of us. Illness is like the great equalizer in this regard and I enjoyed that aspect of the film a lot.\n\n\\-Charbli Dean's passing is absolutely tragic. Outside of the loss of a very young life we also lost a very talented woman who was just on the edge of truly breaking out. We will never get to see the magnificent performances. She was wonderful in this film and radiated charisma every step of the way. It's truly a tragedy, Rest in Power",

Are his acts accidental, is he in tune with a supposed flow of things and can turn situations around for him? \"Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?\"\n\nI truly admire the way he lives and acts to be honest. I reckon he's got his finger on the pulse somehow, and that's what draws so many to these films.\n\n*  **The Dude in \"The big Lebowski\":**\n\nIt's pretty obvious how strong this character is, I mean it's a cliche at this point! A whole religion was born out of him, and his philosophy/ way of being is pretty fleshed out in the film so I don't think I have to go into detail really\n\n*  **Buster in \"Ballad of Busters scruggs\"(westerns in general have this type of character, cf: Bear Claw in J.J)**\n\nAll his songs and quotes point towards this enlightened man that is captain of his ship, up until the very end (and after!). He's also got this j*e ne sais quoi* about him that I highly admire\n\n* **Paterson in \"Paterson\":**\n\nJust another perfect exemplification of what I mean. (Unrelated, but that ending scene is my absolute favourite in any film, ever. Exquisite. Aha!)\n\n*  Wit in \"The Thin Red Line\"\n\nWhat a man. Truly. Again, fits into that archetype of the sage amongst us mere mortals haha\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this doesn't come off as a low effort post, but I know there's a term for this type of archetype/ way of being and it's on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't for the life of me describe what I mean!!\n\nOtherwise, I would love to hear about the characters that anyone else loves/respects/would emulate if possible-in that young child phase of copying everyone!\n\nBest to you all",

        "text": "Music videos are an essential aspect of the music scene, and they seem to have their own cinematic language. These bite-sized movies have the potential to be highly experimental, cinematic experiences, but I find that many music videos deliver the same thing--flashy visuals without much cinematic substance. This is just fine; I understand most music videos are fluff. However, I'd love to find more music videos that play with the language of film, that take interesting risks, or that have significant artistic value.\n\nOne filmmaker that comes to mind is Michel Gondry, whose music videos often feature how-did-they-do-that stunts such as long takes. Not exactly Tarkovsky, but his music videos are often *doing* something with the medium. I also remember having a lengthy conversation about Childish Gambino's \"This is America\" in a college course, because the images in the video create a distinct artistic statement. \n\nOne of my favorite music videos is for the song \"Wings\" by Haerts directed by Emily Kai Bock. The video consists of silent \"home footage,\" presumably filmed by a young man. The video packs so much life and story into its runtime that I feel I know a lot about the family on screen, and the footage feels incredibly authentic, partially because it looks exactly like the kind of stuff a 12-year-old would choose to focus on: weird bugs, pretty sunsets, awkward family encounters. Partway through, the movie takes a thrilling, magical turn that gives me goosebumps every time. The video absolutely deconstructs the typical music video format in a really satisfying way, and the audience isn't spoonfed the slice-of-life story. \n\n(This question is partially in response to the fact that I recently read that Taylor Swift's 15-minute \"All Too Well\" music video is being submitted to the Oscars, and I found that film to be an uninspired, surprisingly literal interpretation of the lyrics.)\n\nWhat other music videos go beyond interesting visuals and use film in an exciting way? Which ones use symbolism to create greater meaning?",

        "text": "**Maybe its a difference between the audiences and the Culture which have developed.**\n\n**Film Reviews(Interpretive Model?)**\n\nI  noticed that when I started to write reviews both on Youtube as well as  submitted then online on Reddit. Most people gave it a \"thumbs up\" or  encourage me to keep writing. Film Reviews seem to work from the  approach of, **\"If you give evidence for your claims then they are a fair claim.**\"  Even if I say I believe the character has this motivation for Doing  such action. As long as it is supported by Evidence people will say,  \"Fair enough.\"\n\nIt also seems a more **\"pro-intellectual\" culture where you are encourage to keep coming up with new ideas and readings of the text.** Getting things right or wrong seems to be less of a priority.\n\n**Song** **Lyric Interpretation(Authoritative Model)**\n\nMeanwhile, I am not sure if you guys are familiar with the **Website Genius** where you can submit lyric interpretations. However, it seems people there and **the Culture that has developed is very different.**  Even if you support your claims with the text people their will  \"downvote\" you. For instance, punk band Screeching Weasel, you could  write, \"We'll I believe Ben Weasel wanted to say, \"X\" because of the  text. Many people will \"Downvote\" you and say, \"**No, because I used to live in his hometown and he meant Y.**\"  Likewise, with other bands like the Artic Monkeys every use of \"slang\"  has to be traced back to its original hometown and how people there use  the language and time used the language.\n\n**It  seems that there's Only One Reading possible of the Lyrics. And Only  the closest reading is the one that's deemed as right. To the point that  the Artists themselves sometimes comes and says what he meants.  I  think this is \"Anti-Intellectual\" since you are encourage to \"Not  comment.\" If you don't give an Authoritative Account of the lyric**s.  Far from being a \"interpretative\" this website and the people there  seem to want a \"Authoritative Reading\" of the text. I could compare it  if you are a Anthropologist and visit  Stockton, California and try to  figure out how College Students in the early 90s talk and based myself  on that to Interpret the Lyrics from the band Pavement since all of them  lived there.\n\n**Ironically,**  Directors, Screenwriters and Auteurs are much more \"Intellectual\"  people and make their films with an Aim to Communicate ideas. Meanwhile,  many Musicians like Stephen Malkmus, Kurt Cobain, Joe King have said  they prioritize the Music in their work and while the Lyrics are  important but an Afterthought. Yet their fans then to be \"aggressive\"  and want to have a more \"Authoritative Account\" of what the Lyrics mean.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "text": "It's a debate as olr as the first crime dramas: is depicting someone who doesn't suffer for their crimes morally wrong and does it endorse their crimes to the audience?\n\nIt's mostly brought up when it comes to the works of Martin Scorsese, though the crime drama genre as a whole and especially gangster films have been constantly hit with it. I've always thought the answer to be a no-brainer, in much the same way the notion that video-games promote violence is easy to disprove, yet I still see this opinion being stated whenever the topic comes into discussion.\n\nThe main point proponents of this opinion seem to have is that if you depict crime as cool, enjoyable and lucrative, then you're promoting it and inviting the viewers to imitate the criminals. But I find this to be an extremely naive and moralist way to look at it. It's almost an Hays Code kind of mentality. \n\nFirst of all, genuinely believing crime doesn't pay or thinking it's best to make people think it doesn't is straight up stupid. Millions of people all around the world commit varying degrees of crime because it does pay, that's the whole point. As long as you don't get caught, crime will almost always net you much more money than an honest living; it's also pretty equal-opportunity (in the sense that anyone can commit crimes) and requires much, much less of an effort put into it in terms of time spent.\n\nIt is also undoubtedly enjoyable. From the rebel teen doing drugs to the most brutal mafia enforcer, most criminals have fun either benefitting from the money they get from committing crimes or even just committing them. Henry Hill repeatedly stated that he loved being a gangster and had no regrets, Jordan Belfort went right back to hustling people out of their money after getting out of prison, and I don't believe Al Capone, Pablo Escobar and what have you shed any tear over the countless wrongs they did.\n\nDemonizing criminals and pretending that what they do is both fruitless and miserable is arguably more dangerous than depicting crime as it is, as it creates what I like to call the \"Dogma\" effect. Basically, admonishing people against something by only showing its negative aspects will shatter said admonishing as soon as they discover its positives, whereas giving a clearer, more objective look at it allows them to value their pros and cons and make decisions for themselves. It's part of why systems like DARE were ultimately useless in getting young people off of drugs.\n\nScorsese has talked plenty about taking objective looks at criminals and understanding their motivation and point of view, which is perfectly normal because at the end of the day they're people, they're not some boogeyman of pure evil, they always have their reason. By pretending they don't, you dehumanize them and trick the average person into thinking they couldn't be criminals themselves.\n\nWatching GoodFellas, it's always been perfectly obvious why Henry, Jimmy, Tommy and the others were terrible people not to be respected or imitated: when a men has been shot and the restaurant owner complains about the towels wasted on stopping his bleeding; when the mob buys a restaurant because the owner asks for protection from one of their own members, and then drives the owner into bankruptcy and burns down the restaurant; when Billy Batts is beaten up for a simple insult, then stuck into a trunk and murdered; when Jimmy starts to have his own friends murdered to have a bigger share of the profit; when Henry drives Karen crazy by constantly cheating on her.\n\nIf committing a crime doesn't hurt yourself, it hurts other people, and organized crime especially is entirely based around using violence to get what you want. It takes really basic human empathy and decency to understand why this is wrong, and if someone genuinely can't understand that a criminal is being depicted as bad unless they suffer personally, then not only does this tell me more about them as a person than the movie itself, but it speaks to me of a general mentality that's too focused on the individual.",

He was offered a lot of role, American Gigolo, Body Heat, The World According To Garp, The Bounty, Splash, Fatal Attraction, Romancing The Stone, Lethal Weapon, Pretty Woman, The Running Man, Total Recall, And Philadelphia.  Reeve realized Hollywood producers wanted him to be an action star. He later said, \"I found most of the scripts of the genre poorly constructed, and I felt the starring roles could easily be played by anyone with a strong physique.\" In addition, he did not feel he was right for the other films he was offered .

He doesn't know what's going on with her. Yet he will ignore what he learned in Chinatown and will continue to act on his misunderstanding of what he thinks she's up to, with disastrous consequences.\n\nEvelyn deflects his reference to her and asks him why it was bad luck for him in Chinatown. His answer is a beautiful form of dramatic irony. *I was trying to keep someone from being hurt. I ended up making sure that she was hurt.*\n\nThis dialogue is preparing the audience for understanding the series of events that issue in the tragic ending of the film.\n\nHis misunderstanding of her actions will set in motion the series of events that will issue in the tragic ending.

The solution: do as little as possible...We understand that the world of Chinatown is difficult to comprehend because we grew up with the ethnic stereotype which underlies Jake's experience: **the Inscrutable Oriental**. It was simply a fact of life for the dominant Anglo population of LA in the 30's and 40's that the Orientals--Chinese, Japanese, Korean, et al--were inscrutable because their language and customs were alien to the dominant white population... \n\nNotice Jake's sudden shift from explaining his Chinatown experience to making the same point about Evelyn. *You can't always tell what's going on.* *Like with you.* Ironically, Jake is right. He doesn't know what's going on with her. Yet he will ignore what he learned in Chinatown and will continue to act on his misunderstanding of what he thinks she's up to, with disastrous consequences.\n\nEvelyn deflects his reference to her and asks him why it was bad luck for him in Chinatown. His answer is a beautiful form of dramatic irony. *I was trying to keep someone from being hurt. I ended up making sure that she was hurt.*\n\nThis dialogue is preparing the audience for understanding the series of events that issue in the tragic ending of the film. \n\nHis misunderstanding of her actions will set in motion the series of events that will issue in the tragic ending. When he does finally find out the truth, he then tries to help her escape the police he had called on her. His desperate actions issue in a replay of the story he tells her here in bed.\n\nJake's tragedy is that he ignored what he learned in Chinatown: Do as little as possible because *You can't always tell what's going on.\"*\\]\n\n[https://hartzog.org/j/chinatownscenes.html](https://hartzog.org/j/chinatownscenes.html)\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "For those who are unfamiliar with the above phrase, in political terminologies \"Only Nixon can go to China\" refers to an instance where a politician with a well known reputation of upholding certain political positions can have the credibility to take actions that are in defiance of those positions and not be destroyed politically. Richard Nixon who was an anti communist his whole life was the only one who could soften relations with Communist China in 1972 without his credibility being destroyed. \n\nWhat are some instances of that for filmmakers/ actors in regards to creating or starting in a film. One example I can think of is Steven Spielberg directing Munich. Only the biggest Jewish artist in the world who has already created a seminal work in regards to Jewish suffering (Schindler's List) could have possibly made a film about the cycle of violence between the Israelis and Palestinians that condemns both sides in 2005 and not have his reputation hurt.",

But i cant tolerate arthouse films. \n\nEven tough i have not seen many arthouse films but here some i remember. \n\nI watched Stalker few months ago and even tough i admire it's themes and technical aspects i still can't bear the film because it is so slow and uninteresting. It's not like i hate slow movies i love movies like Godfather etc. But i cant tolerate arthouse slowness. \n\nThen comes the eraser head which I tried to watch few weeks ago as i was excited about it because of its plot and i have to say it was a huge disappointment! Now i wanted to see David Lynch 's mullohland drive but now i am avoiding that film because I was not able to complete eraser head. \n\nThe first 10-20 mins\n was such a big disappointment for me with no dialogues i expected it to start like psycho(1960) rapid and fast. It's not like i hate silence in films there will be blood had no dialogues in its first 10-15 mins but it was engaging for me. \n\nThen today I tried the seventh seal as it was considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and again i was disappointed. I expected the movie to be completely a chess game played between the knight and the death but it went somewhere which was not expected so dud imo. \n\nOverall my complaints regarding these films are same. They have intersting plot deep themes amazing technical aspects but i just can't complete these films. \nMaybe i am not a tarkovsky,Bergmann guy rather than i am more of Scorsese, Tarantino,Nolan,Fincher, Kubrick,PTA,Coen brothers,Sergio Leone etc. \nWhat are your thoughts regarding arthouse films and the post would love to know your opinion.",

The acting was impressive - all of the characters felt like real people. I found myself disliking Sarah Jane. Her self hatred made sense, particularly when taking the time period into consideration, but I hated how she looked down on her mother, Annie. The scene where her boyfriend beats her up in the alleyway was so shocking. The ending made me so, so sad. I just found myself wishing that Annie could have lived a better life, and not died of a broken heart. The film made me think a lot about segregation, and the one thing that did bother me about it was how the actress who played Sarah Jane didn’t really look black at all - I know that she was supposed to be white passing, but I had always thought that a white passing black person would still look at least a tad bit black and not just fully, fully white like that (I mean, her hair is never curly or anything, it’s especially confusing as I’ve read that she wasn’t actually supposed to be biracial)",

It doesn’t really progress the story much and Florya is barely built as a character and it lessens the terror quite a bit because it’s hard to become emotionally invested in him. \n\nSame thing with threads, the first half was really good and I could feel the anxiety of the situation but after the bombs strike, the plot basically stops moving and honestly, If they shortened the aftermath to 20 minutes instead of an hour and still have the same effect. Would’ve worked more maybe as a fictional documentary. \n\nI feel like a (short) film that does a great job of portraying something absolutely terrifying(humanities conflict and eventually defeat by machines) in that it’s a combination of a documentary and short vignettes of events occurring through a period of about fifty years or so. It doesn’t feel like it has justify why these scenes are shown, they just are. \n\nPost is a ramble but felt a lot more disturbed by movies like Schindler’s list or In this corner of the movie compared to movies like Threads(more problems with this one) and Come and See, which feel like a bunch of disturbing war scenes strung together by a bare-bone storyline.",

        "text": "Stop me if you have hear this one before: a Hollywood movie decided to include a scene set in China in the movie in order to appeal to the Chinese market, this is somehow a terrible thing and a cynical decision by a greedy studio to make more money.\n\nAnd yet during this entire argument nobody ask the question: Why was the rest of the movie set in the US?\n\nThe attempts by Hollywood films to pander to foreign audiences are seen by US critics often with very negative eyes, and yet from an outsider perspective it looks like a quite myopic perspective ([here is the top box office for Indonesia, the fourth most populated country on Earth](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2022/?area=ID&amp;grossesOption=totalGrosses&amp;sort=openingWeekendGross)). The nature of Hollywood as an industry means that it has become a global cultural behemoth, it exist not only in a dominant position but often as the only real entity in said field as far as the normal person is concerned. And yet whiting the domestic US audience it remains an expectation for it to be a US industry that exist only for the US sake ([here is the top box office for Germany](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2022/?area=DE&amp;grossesOption=calendarGrosses&amp;sort=rank&amp;sortDir=asc)).\n\nThe US is as right now, and at least for a few more years, the biggest economy on Earth, the most powerful military by far, and the most dedicated cultural exporter. Whatever the US produces the world consumes, and this is strangely something that US audience and critics seem to not truly grasp when it comes to cinema.\n\nLet’s take for example the eternal byzantine preaching about diversity, this is a discussion that everyone here must be more than familiar with, but what I find fascinating is how said discussion is always without failure framed in a context centered entirely around the USA. The people to be represented are the “minorities” (as understood by the US) the “POC”, the idea that an entire different society could be represented is not something that is even worth considering ([here is the top box office for Brazil](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2022/?area=BR&amp;grossesOption=calendarGrosses)).\n\nCynical me is convinced that this is simply a result of the true intentions of the diversity discussion, regardless of its pretenses as some kind of moral mandate. The reason to push for movies to include more Yank black urbanites is the same reason to push for the movie to include a random scene set in China, to sell to that specific demographic. It’s a purely economic move disguised as some kind of heroic push for social justice, the idea that the people watching the movie should feel represented by it is not the real concern.\n\nTo illustrate this point I propose an exercise to any of you: **Name one Indonesian character**. Earlier I linked to the Indonesian box office, absolutely dominated by Hollywood films, this is the fourth most populated country on Earth. If there was truly any kind of moral concern for making the people who watch the movie see themselves reflected in the screen then this should be a trivial exercise. So go ahead, **name one Indonesian character**.\n\nIt doesn’t help that even if a Hollywood movie is theoretically set in another country with foreign characters, it’s rather obvious that there was little to no concern about the audience from said country. When Hollywood wants an Indian perspective for example, their solution is to get Betsy Ross Gupta from Connecticut, who can totally talk about her Indianx lived experiences because her great-grandpa was a Punjabi aristocrat who collaborated with the British. In that sense a foreign setting almost always exist for the sake of the US audience. The entire continent of Africa as far as Hollywood is concerned is a setting meant to appeal to black Muricans with enough disposable income.\n\nSo if you are a Yank, next time you see a random scene set in China, take comfort knowing the Chinese pandering will end in a few minutes and your pandering will resume for the next hour and a half of the movie.",

For a fully illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/elsie-jane-wilsons-the-dream-lady/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/elsie-jane-wilsons-the-dream-lady/)\n\nThe struggle for gender equality has no start date. There are events that can be marked and movements that can be traced, but the fight against patriarchal power goes all the way back to the beginning.\n\nIt is tempting to create a linear narrative where women’s rights have gradually improved over time, but it is far more complicated than that. *The Dream Lady* is an example of such complications. *The Dream Lady* is a silent film from 1918 directed by Elsie Jane Wilson. The film craft is unremarkable. The cinematography is utilitarian and the dialogue is ordinary, but the content is surprising. It’s the story of a young woman who refuses to settle for anything less than the fulfillment of her dreams. She doesn’t worry about gender inequality, or the future of society. She is simply determined to live her life on her own terms. \n\nHer dream becomes a reality when her uncle dies, leaving her a large inheritance. This detail is somewhat glossed over, but her ability to fulfill her dreams and disregard patriarchal norms is almost entirely due to her newfound wealth. As an inspirational story about a woman who lives life on her own terms, its message is somewhat undermined by not fully engaging in how economics intersects with patriarchy.\n\nIt would not be inaccurate to describe *The Dream Lady* as a story about a privileged white woman getting what she wants, but it would be an oversimplification and disservice to the valuable message the film is conveying. Rosamond, the uncompromising heroine, can be seen as one of many aspirational role models. Many early Twentieth century women might not have the money to make their dreams come true, but seeing a movie where a woman refuses to compromise or follow the avenues society provides for her can be encouraging or inspirational. If men can dream of being Tarzan or superman, why can’t young women dream of being bold, self-actualized heiresses? \n\nRosamond has a list of four things she wants: a home in the countryside, a Japanese dressing gown, a bloodhound, and a gentleman husband. She also wants to become a “gypsy” fortune teller, so she can spread joy and happiness to everyone she meets. \n\nOne such person she meets is Sydney Brown. Brown is a young woman, perhaps in her twenties. She has managed to secure a few days of carefree vacation by telling her mother that she is at a friend's house. She seeks Rosamond’s advice, and together they decide to cut Brown’s hair and dress her as a man, in order to provide Brown with some much-needed freedom. Brown exclaims, “What a joy to be free, to move about without being controlled.” She goes on to explain that, like Rosamond, she wants to take this opportunity to fulfill her “whims and fantasies.”\n\nThe film is based on a story written by Margaret Widdemer entitled *Why Not?* The title is an interesting choice of words. The film doesn’t actually address this question. It provides an example of what could be done, and then leaves the audience to ponder why it could or could not be possible. Even if what Rosamond accomplishes is out of reach for most women, it can be useful to enumerate the reasons why it is out of reach. *The Dream Lady* may not be intersectional in its depiction of women’s struggle, but it can provide a place for such discussions to begin.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article you might also enjoy - https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/bride-of-the-beast-a-primer-on-sex-and-gender/",

        "text": "I watched a screening of Tsai's Goodbye, Dragon Inn recently, a remastered showing in 4K on the big screen. The film left a hollow, ghostly feeling within me, amplified in one of the last few scenes, when like a mirror, we the audience watched the heroine tidy the empty cinema after its last showing, while the theatre on my end was packed to the brim. \n\nThough it's been almost 18 years since this film was released, I don't believe we've seen the death of the theatre just yet, even with streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney plus. \n\nIn fact, just this week, the theatres in my country were showing a screening of Black Panther almost once every 30 minutes, from the theatres opening to closing. This weekend, most of the seats were sold out. I have never before seen a film be screened this many times in a day, it's almost a monopoly in the theatre. \n\nIn some ways, I detest the Marvel takeover in cinemas. I'm sure there were many new films theatres could have brought in for viewers that were undoubtedly denied a showing to make way for the these mega blockbusters. However, for more casual movie goers who enjoy a good blockbuster every now and then, Marvel has been a great help in maintaining a steady stream of movie theatre goers. I definitely understand from an economic POV, where there is demand, there are profits. What do you think about the Marvel (or blockbuster franchise) theatre takeover? Do you think it's right that movie theatres should continue to flush out their \"less popular\" films to make way for these films, at least to carry on the culture of cinema-going? \n\nTLDR: Tsai's Goodbye, Dragon Inn predicted a future where cinemas go out of business, which I still do not think is the case today. However, what I do see is a takeover of the cinema by large mega blockbuster franchises, especially Marvel films, drowning out many other films from being screened in theatres. What do you think about this phenomenon that's occurring?",

The film in my opinion has an interesting enough story for it to have been edited in the traditional format but the reverse-chronology of it all really drives home the point of what Noé is trying to do here.

        "text": "Major spoilers, I'm diving right in. \n\nI've seen this movie many times and it's in my top 3 favorites of all time. Generally I have accepted the theory that Diane is Betty in the dream, Camilla is a more vulnerable version of herself as Rita in the dream, and the latter bit is all reality.\n\nI noticed one thing today that threw all of it off: the couple walking down the sidewalk laughing right after Rita's car accident. They say almost the exact same words as real life Adam and Camilla at the party. Rita looks horrified, then falls asleep in some bushes, dreams more; sneaks into the house, dreams more; etc. \n\nSo then I thought, ho shit, what if real life Rita is BETTY in the dream, and real life Diane is RITA in the dream, and that relationship dynamic, and most (if not all) of what occurs in the dream is what actually happened? It's seen through different actors - the characters are jumping from body to body, but it's all there. \n\nCoco and her husband could be the elderly people in the beginning and end. They suck up to real Camilla, a rising star, and look down on real Diane, who really did get into a crash, lose her memory, and wander into their party. She really had a bag full of cash... to kill the real blond girl who got her part (this is the girl)?? This creates new questions... \n\nThe murder of the long haired guy could be exactly how real life Camilla dies - apparent suicide. Before his death, he and the assassin were laughing about a car crash... Real Diane's car crash that I always thought was real Camilla's car crash. Long haired guy is Camilla. Vacuum cleaner guy is LOUISE and Camilla is the person who won't get out of her room... (Temporary digs)\n\nI can't find anything to disprove it yet... but I'm slowly watching the movie throughout the day and am thinking about quitting while I'm ahead. I'm trying not to think too hard about it, just watching closely from this new perspective.\n\nFascinating.",

        "text": "So when Sam is walking back home with the groceries and notices someone following him, I’m beginning to realize that he was seeing a, so to say, reflection of himself, hence being so frightened; because he’s scared of himself. The dog killer is never found nor is the mysterious figure we see following him. And the director clearly wanted us to assum that Sam was the killer bc there are so many clues or red herrings idk. But if that WERE the case and he has killed all the dogs then i rlly think he was so delirious that he saw an image of himself and got spooped.",
