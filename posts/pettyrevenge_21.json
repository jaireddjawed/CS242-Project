        "text": "This memory came to mind after a brief discussion with a friend.\n\nIt was only revenge in the fact that I was able to use his own words against him, but.. here we go.\n\n\nA couple of years ago, my then boyfriend had planned a guys fishing day with a rented boat, long drive, and a bunch of rented fishing equipment. This was completely fine with me, as the majority of his ‘friends’ accompanying him were coworkers who I disliked.\nI disliked said coworkers because I heard and observed on a regular basis their demeaning gab about women, witnessed their leering gazes towards others in front of their partners (my partner included), and the just absolute disrespect they had for their significant others in all aspects. To me, it wasn’t respectful, but I don’t know a lot of men socially so I just chose to stay away from gatherings rather than be offended/upset at each one.\nMy then boyfriend kept bringing up the trip to me, saying how badly he wished I could come (even though he was the organizer.)\nI reiterated again and again that I didn’t care to go anyway. Honestly, I think he just wished me there so I could bait his hook for him. I wasn’t interested. I’d seen how previous parties and get togethers had gone. I told him multiple times that I had no cares or issues with him going without me.\nFinally, the day before, he brought it up AGAIN.\nHe said how badly he wished I could join in their fun. I again said I was fine without. He pushed the issue. I almost feel like he wanted me to be upset that I wasn’t invited.\nI flat out told him that I was happy not to come and make an obligated appearance. I explained that I was still upset over previous parties where the men just acted like pigs and I would rather not be put in that situation yet again.\nHe was fuming after that.\nHe said “Want me to act like a pig? I’ll be a fucking pig tomorrow. Just wait, because I can’t. Oink oink.”\nI won’t lie, that hurt. But I decided to let it go.\nLater that day, he was texting and calling me. I ignored all communications. It ranged from flat discussion to anger, to pleads of not fighting. He told me he was with his coworkers and didn’t want to fight any longer.\nI should also state that we were planning our two year anniversary trip (Covid limited us to somewhat local getaways) at the time.\nHe ended up calling me in front of his coworkers. My guess is to keep me from lashing out at him.\nHe called and I answered.\nHe asked “Camping, or hotel?” in reference to our anniversary getaway.\nI paused, and then answered “Farm. Oink oink.”",

        "text": "Many years ago, my family, two young boys and wife took off for the holiday of a lifetime, 9 months of camping and driving right around Australia.\n\nBecause of where we wanted to go we were set up to be completely self sufficient, we could comfortably be on our own, no contact with the outside world for more than two weeks, it also meant we got pretty good at setting up and breaking camp. \n\nAfter nearly 9 months and 42000 Km we were getting pretty homesick and excited to be getting close to home so were doing some pretty long driving days, second last day comes and goes and we are still 500Km from home in a fairly major town with just too much of a drive to get home that day. We could have continued a bit and camped out but decided to treat ourselves to a camp site in a tourist park, easy hot showers without needing to light a fire and boil water.\n\nWe book in and it was bloody expensive, the most expensive tourist park anywhere we had come across, they also demanded $20 as a security deposit for the toilet block key. Back then, (1994,) $20 was a considerable amount of money. I was a bit put out and a bit wary of this bloke so I asked him. \"Do we get this money back?\" Him. \"Yes, it's a deposit\" I replied. \"We are leaving early in the morning about 7:00\" Him. \"No problem we will be up\"\n\nWell we have a good sleep but are all excited to be nearly home so we were up and packed up by 7:00. I go to the office to return the key and get our $20 back but it's all locked tight and shut up with curtains drawn. Bastard, I knew he had no intention of returning the deposit. \n\nNow a little word picture of the office setup, it's a two story wood framed structure, with planks on the walls, Office on the ground floor, living space above. A locked drop box to drop the keys in so they get the keys back and get to keep the deposit. A push button beside the door to summon someone to the office if they are down the back cleaning the toilets or whatever. The push button has a heavy welded steel cover locked in place with a padlock over the button so they could ignore patrons if they wanted to. They had bell wire from the covered push button running up the wall to a huge bell, this bell was meant to be heard if they were down the back mowing. \n\nI always carry a pocket knife when I'm camping, I'm also a technician so quite familiar with how these bells work, I grab the pocket knife and just gently push the blade through the insulation of the wire until it shorts the wires out, the bell rings loud enough to wake the dead, it was rattling the wooden walls. Thirty seconds of that and the park bloke and all his family came down all in their pyjamas and very grump about being woken so early. They had no idea how I had got the bell to ring they checked the padlock and the metal cover, grumping and mumbling the whole time. I smiled and handed him the key and he went back in and got my $20. 5 hours later we were home.\n\nI am a technician, I knew the bell was a 12 volt bell, no danger to anyone shorting it out, that's what the button does. Bell wire is like speaker cable, two thin wires insulated from each other side by side, by pushing my knife in I contacted the wires and completed the circuit. I had no qualms doing it, this bastard probably does this all the time and makes quite a bit by not being there when people need to check out.",

        "text": "I just told this story at a gathering over the holidays when a family member asked if I (a female) experienced sexism while serving in the military. \n\nOn the whole, I had a great experience serving and most of my coworkers were really amazing. Except for “Brad” (fake name). Brad was the living worst. He was a lazy, know-it-all (but really only a know-enough-to-get-by-and-keep-up-appearances), misogynist. During our first in-office interaction, he leaned back and said, totally unprompted and completely out of context, “…Yeah I’ve never met a woman who was smarter than me”, to which I immediately replied “That’s weird? Because I’ve met A LOT of women smarter than you”. Thus began our cold war.\n\nPart of our job was to maintain a certain level of knowledge and proficiency among an array of different topics and specialties. We had a whole book that we were more or less supposed to know front to back. Because this was part of my JOB, I made sure to stay proficient. Not everyone thought this was important. Now Brad, the smartest person in the room, was in the training shop and was in charge of creating and proctoring our weekly proficiency and knowledge tests. A test which I aced every week, scoring higher than the males (who did not care that I scored higher), and even catching errors that Brad would make. \n\nBrad’s fragile ego could not allow him to admit that me, a *gasp* WOMAN, knew even more than the other men and sometimes even more than Brad himself. So he would find arbitrary reasons to fail me every week. Didn’t like the specific color of blue ink I was using? Fail. Didn’t like that I abbreviated my rank when signing the test? Fail. Didn’t think I put enough thought into choosing the (multiple choice) answer? Fail. Walked into the testing room before him, thus invalidating my test results (yes literally)? Fail. \n\nWe all laughed off this behavior because he was only making himself look insane, and my unit commander saw that I was getting all of my test questions correct (again it was my job to know that stuff), so he was unfazed by my 0% scores. Not to mention, this was all internal testing, so no one outside our org ever got the results. Not really a big deal.\n\nUNTIL, Brad decides that he needs to nitpick a non-issue. He decides that instead of doing his weekly test, he was going to spend the hour lecturing us on how to properly classify presentations. Evidently a female in the office had misspelled a classification on a slide (think “unclasified” versus “unclassified”), thus creating a “major security breach” (she didn’t). Now don’t get me wrong, using proper classifications is incredibly important and is top priority in creating a presentation, but the difference between “secret” and “secrett” is not going to bring down the establishment. Most people, except for Brad evidently, can use common sense and know that a slide marked “secrett” should still be treated as secret. Because duh.\n\nOn to the petty revenge. Brad made a ponderous presentation, including slides that actually included an array of different classified material. This presentation was supposed to take all hour. By the fifth or sixth slide however, we get to some REALLY sensitive information. And what has been missing from every. single. one. of Brad’s slides? You guessed it! A classification on the top and bottom of the slide! Brad had just spent fifteen minutes teaching (to a room full of adult professionals) how IMPORTANT slide classifications were and how ESSENTIAL it was to have them on the top and the bottom.\n\nNow, should I have made a note and approached him after the presentation? Maybe. But did I? F***********ck no! I got my petty revenge. So I waited until he took a pause between slides and said (loudly, from the back of the room) “Hey Brad, maybe next time you want to teach us how important it is to classify a slide, you might want to actually classify your own work. You’ve got some sensitive information on there that isn’t classified, which you just explained to us is a major security breach and should be reported to the commander. None of your slides have had classifications up to now. Unless… this presentation is an example of what you DONT want us to do?” Shocked pikachu face.\n\nBrad looked like a trout gasping for life as he glanced at his computer, to me, then back to the screen. Everyone started laughing and two of our superiors actually got up to leave saying they had things that were actually important to get to.\n\nSometimes the best revenge is just knowing how to do your job and do it well, despite the Brads of the world.",

I needed money for Christmas gifts and got a job at the Gap at the local mall. \nAfter a good interview with a woman about 10 years older than me. She asked the normal questions, told me the job was only for the holidays and when I would be going back to school. I told her when and that I knew it was temporary that I needed money for Christmas gifts. I asked about the pay and frequency. It was minimum wage and paid bi-weekly.\nI take the job and quickly learn that all the jeans on the shelf had to be folded a certain way or the Mgr would throw a hissy fit. Customers were a nightmare never putting anything back on the shelf and just dropping jeans on the floor. We’d constantly be picking up, sorting by size and folding them the “Gap” way.\nAll goes well and I’m looking forward to my first paycheck as in just the first two weeks I had worked 50+ hours.\nShe hands out paychecks but skips me. Afterwards I ask her about my paycheck, and she tells me that the Corp office in CA holds the first check and I’ll be paid at the next pay period in two weeks.\nI looked at her in disbelief, as I realize that the next pay period will be AFTER Christmas!\nI said you knew I took this job to get money for Christmas gifts, why didn’t you tell me about the paycheck hold, knowing I actually won’t be paid until AFTER Christmas?\nShe told me she needed the help and thought I wouldn’t take the job if I knew this!\nI got in her face and screamed at her for lying to me, that I quit, and to have payroll mail my check to me, and as I walked out I told my coworkers what just happened. They couldn’t believe it as they were told about the pay hold at the time they were hired. \nCue petty revenge. \nSince I didn’t really have anywhere to go at 3:00 in the afternoon, I hung out for a little while at the mall. Later on, I saw the Mgr and heading to the food court for her dinner break and I knew it was my opportunity…\nI went back to the store and started swiping all the jeans into piles. I apologized to my former coworkers, but they understood.\nI left the store in chaos.\n3 coworkers clocked out and left sick. This left the Mgr and only 2 others to clean up. But screw them too. I was super pissed. :/",

        "text": "I live in the most popular skiing resort in Sweden and being close to the Norwegian border we, naturally, get a lot of Norwegians. Some of them own houses, apartments, cabins, whatever, but most of them come here because alcohol and ware high in sugar (mostly soda) is a lot cheaper here than in Norway. Now this wouldn't be a problem if they could just learn how to drive, park their car properly, and in general just behave like people. They don't. At all.\n\nSo one Saturday during a particularly nasty Norwegian invasion I had bought a large coffee and some pastry in the bakery nearby Systembolaget (the state alcohol monopoly). As I was driving home i passed the parking lot serving Systembolaget and realised that a spot was about to open up in an almost impossibly rare moment where there were noone looking for a spot. I took it. I payed for 90 minutes and had my \"fika\" (Swedish word for coffee break with pastry or something similar) while watching Rick and Morty. I did not visit Systembolaget. Then I payed for an extra 30 min and watched more Rick and Morty, but this time I mostly enjoyed looking att increasingly frustrated people looking for a parking spot. \n\nIt was a good day.",

My sweet mother has an obsession with stuffed gnome Christmas decorations and other similar creatures. She gives each of them names, and she jokingly includes them as part of the family. \n\nAt the beginning of this Christmas season, she purchased a “family” of Christmas gnomes: a mom, dad, and two kids. After purchasing them, she called my nana. I’m the oldest grandchild and the only grandchild who is married. So I will likely be the one to make Nana a great grandma. My mom told Nana that she has some big news and that she should sit down. My mom told her that she was going to be a grandma, and then she showed her the family of gnomes, AKA her grandchildren. \n\nMy husband and I knew we had to get her back, so we made a plan. I ordered a Christmas gnome as her Christmas present. And I put it in a gift bag with a tag that says “to grandma”. When I gave it to her, I made sure she read the tag before opening the gift. She gave me a look of shock and excitement when she saw what it said. And then I told her to just open the present. As soon as she pulled out the gnome, she knew exactly what I had done and why.",

We put them in the back of the office area so everyone in the waiting room was comfortable, and they waited their turn like everyone else.\n\nWell, an inmate came in one day, and an older man watched him being taken straight in. He piped up and demanded to know why they were going in before him, and I told him exactly why. Everyone else in the waiting room got it, but this dude just sat down and steamed until he finally stood up and started yelling about how he served his country in Korea and we all fucking owed him and he was a law-abiding citizen and how DARE a \"law breaker\" get taken back before him. And then he honestly, seriously started trying to foment a fucking waiting room rebellion over it, which the other patients were getting pretty pissed at.\n\nHe got me on the wrong day, because after asking him very nicely to stop several times and restating that the inmate was NOT jumping the line, I finally yelled back at him to STFU and I'd take him back.\n\nSo I did. Took him back to the back of the office and sat him next to the two officers. One of them looked at him and said \"I'm guessing you're the one who's been screaming in the waiting room? Yeah, I'm going to assume you'll be nice and quiet now.\" I shot the officer an \"I love you so much right now\" look, he winked back, and the loud asshat didn't make another peep.",

        "text": "\nI work in a busy eye clinic. I saw that a patient named “tyler” was marked as waiting so I marked the chart as taken, saw what he was here for, and checked that he was the only Tyler in the waiting room. My usual routine. It’s a long walk to the waiting room so I don’t even bother trying to memorize the last names anymore - I usually forget or butcher them by the time I get to the front. The patients have a sheet that are very specific to the doctor they are seeing - has their name, DOB, MRN, doctors name &amp; the appointment time. I’ve never taken the wrong patient back even when there were several patients with the same name I called. \n\nWell anyways I get to the waiting room, call for “Tyler” while standing at the door about 30 feet from the waiting chairs. No movement from anyone. The waiting room is packed with at least 30 people. I call again 2 times, and finally a guy on the phone says “what’s the last name?”. I ask if his names tyler and the dude again asks “what’s the last name”. I honestly don’t know, but like I said he’s the only Tyler there. I tell him to just come on back and he asks again what’s the last name. Remaining seated, not giving me his paper. I tell him it’s a hipaa violation for me to announce full names, which honestly I’m not sure if it is, but I know that I’m supposed to limit PHI as much as possible and there was no reason to announce his full name to 30 people - and again, I don’t know the last name because I’ve never needed to know it before opening the chart again. I tell him that it looks like you’re the only Tyler here, come on back and I’ll check your paper. Nope, he wasn’t having it. (As an aside- I would totally understand not wanting to get up for no reason if he was elderly, but the man was in his 30’s)\n\nFinally i just cross the extra 30 feet and I literally have to take the paper out of his hand, he didn’t hand it to me, and make sure I recognize the full name, appointment time, doc, etc. It’s literally not possible that it’s the wrong Tyler. I say “yep, you’re Tyler”. All the way back to the exam room this guy is absolutely fuming. I explain to him that he was the only Tyler in the waiting room, but if he wasn’t all he had to do was promptly hand me his sheet so I could confirm he was the right guy. I tell him it’s never been a problem before - surely he’s seen that everyone else just gets up and walks to the door to the back, hands their sheet over, and we continue to a room. I try to make small talk to shift the mood on the way to the exam room. He’s not taking it, not calming down a bit. Just absolutely fuming for.. what? \n\nSo we get to an exam room finally after this guys been huffing and making comments under his breath the whole walk. I tell him to sit in the black chair, he sits in one of the guest chairs that are RED. I repeat myself and he huffily moves. Like, toddler huffing and puffing when they’re mad. I ask him how his vision is doing and he says it’s the same as last time. I ask him if he has x symptoms and he huffs and says everything is the same as last time. I ask him again because it will take 5-6 min to look through his chart to open the right encounter, then the note,  then the detailed report, scroll through 6 pages to the bottom, etc,  versus the 10 seconds for him to just answer me. At the point it’s taken twice as long to get this guy in the right chair and to get through the first 4 questions that I usually get answered before i even log into the computer. I tell him we would be halfway done already if he just cooperated. Guy gets huffed and puffed again and asks to see someone else - *the magic words*. \n\nI tell him that’s a great idea with a huge smile (under my mask haha). Leave the room and waste about 20 minutes deleting all my input from his chart. Then I ask the SLOWEST coworker possible - literally struggles to pry her eyes from her phone to look at the schedule - to take him. She always takes patients and sits on her phone forever so that she ends up taking less patients throughout the day. She won’t take shit from anybody - the biggest bitch in the office tbh. I couldn’t have found a meaner, set in her ways stubborn, quick to anger person to set on him lol. I tell her there’s no rush, doc is behind anyways. &amp; by the time she goes in it’s been 50 minutes since I left him in the room. She literally had to ask the exact same questions I did, so not sure why he thought it’d be different. I took a different patient, who was a compliant sweetheart, and was done before coworker went in with “Tyler”. \n\nGuy checked in at 1:00 pm and didn’t leave till 4. Hopefully the extra 50 minutes in time out gave him time to calm down from his hissy fit so he wasn’t an ass to everyone else in the office. If he would’ve just stuck it out with me and played nice + answered my questions - I average about 9 minutes for a full work up.",

They had several grown children and were in their 70s roughly retired. \n\nWe, on the other hand, have 5 kids, maybe don't mow the grass the right away, toys left out from time to time, big backyard smokers.  We aren't trashy or out of place for the neighborhood. We just don't place as much value on those things as they did.\n\nOne day, we decided to have a fire, in a regulation fire pit, well enough away from the house that it wasn't an issue.  We wanted to roast marshmallows with the kids, and I had just lost my job from the pandemic (food industry), so we were deciding on the next move.  As we were sitting there, suddenly we heard sirens and we went to the front yard where the fire department was parking.   Our neighbors had called them on us.  The fire department left without issue, and we were pissed but let it go.\n\nA few weeks later, I fire up my charcoal grill without giving it much thought, and as I'm flipping the steaks, I see 2 firemen walk around to my backyard.   Once again, the popes had called, claiming we were burning trash. It also became clear that they had called the city code enforcement on us who of course gave us a hard time even 1 week over  3 inches, as well as the police knocking on my door at 1am (when we had a newborn) because the popes said my truck was parked too close to a fire hydrant, it wasn't of course. \n\nBy this time, I was beginning to formulate my plan, It was going to start with a new smoker.  I was going to build a bbq food truck and keep the smokers going in my backyard every night.  So that's what I did.  Started with a 20 dollar smoker, moved to a giant drum smoker that I burned down yard wood and put under the meat and each time the fire department came put, besides being embarrassed for coming out, they couldn't stop me using wood to cook food.\n\nEventually, we got a food truck, and the community supported us on our first night, where we parked right in front of our house.  Everyone but the popes, as my wife was actively having a miscarriage (what would be our last child), but still out front greeting people, the husband drove bye flicking my wife off while I was serving people in the truck.  \n\nAnother night he came outside while I was cooking cursing at me, saying I married a bitch (furthest thing from the truth, my wife befriends everyone), trying to get me to fight him so he could call the cops.  I just smiled and offered him meat from my smoker...FUCK OFF, is all I got in return.\n\nHe also decided to give a bad review on Yelp using a face facebook account.  After reverse image searching the name, I contacted the 21 year old POC that he had stolen identity from, and the post was removed .\n\nEventually, they decided to move, but even the day before they moved, I could see her on the phone in her kitchen from where I was smoking, in agony talking to someone.  Eventually, the fire department came put and left as they always did, and that sad, pathetic couple left as well.  \n\nEssentially, I started an entire business out of spite, which has left me with a great business that, within a few weeks, we will be opening a restaurant and a greater sense of how to deal with unreasonable people.",

Worked for a well known building supply, after numerous different positions got my happy place, outside garden cashier. When they did the change over for more self checks, they also built a hut with register inside so we would be more comfortable. AC and heater and have some feeling of safety. Keep in mind I could go 2+ hours without seeing another employee and was at the far end of the store away from the main check outs. Oh in south Tex so weather is an issue. Then the district manager (manager backed him up) said we could no longer use the hut and had to use a wide open register. Raining in, tough luck, extreme temp drop, deal with it, oh, lightening, yea you can come in. Hundreds in cash money came thru arms length from customers. Right on a major highway across from the county jail. Convenience store not 50 yds away was robbed. LEOs would ask me what the hell are they thinking, this is dangerous for you ladies. Yes, I brought my concerns on numerous occasions up to management, was told in essence, oh well, deal with it. So, I walked in  2 hours early for my shift, so they would have time to get coverage, and handed in my resignation with a big smile. Didn't realize how stressed out I was being constantly on guard, because as I walked out, did a little hop/happy step. Went straight home, called the complaint line and filed a formal complaint of unsafe working conditions. It came down, the use of the hut was reinstated and it was not long after that the manager was \"no longer\" with the company and I think another was transferred, oh well. The company tag line is something to the effect of \"the health and safety of our employees and customers is our top priority\". Yea, right, not there. The other employees thanked me, because they couldn't/wouldn't go that far and endanger their jobs. It felt great actually, going up against the big guy and making a difference for the folks I left behind.

They bullied us all, and knew they could get away with it as we all needed the money and it was only for a few months a year. I felt I got part of my revenge by walking out and forcing a closure, however my petty revenge is in regards to the uniform. They were always very tight and never wanted to spend money and so always tried to reuse uniform or kit. I had returned most of it, but I found a few new shirts, that would have been perfect for new starters as they hadn’t been worn. I knew the owners address, and so packaged them up. I made sure to include some rather large, heavy rocks wrapped into the uniform. I then posted it with their name and address but no stamp. Knowing full well, that Royal Mail (UK) would retain the package at our local store, and put a slip in their address to say they had a package. I still chuckle at the thought of them having to go all the way to the post office to retrieve a mysterious parcel, and would then have to foot the bill of said parcel due to the lack of stamp. I chuckle even more knowing that the 2 shirts would have weighed around 8kg due to the large rocks costing them even more for an overweight parcel.",

        "text": "This story takes place 4 years ago,\n\nAfter working in Hospitality in Australia, I had a rude awakening when returning home to the UK and trying to be a bartender. Going from working as a supervisor in a topless bar near Sydney (still my best job to date) to working in TGIFs. Even though I was able to get 6, 5-star reviews on TripAdvisor in one night, for my banter with the customers. The managers still treat you like you're a child that doesn't know their vodka from their red wine.\n\nI decided to leave TGIFs and look for another supervisor bartending job (As I thought If I managed myself It will be better) and I found a job extremely quickly which should have been my first red flag.\n\nI attended an informal interview with the landlord (Peter) where I explained how I was able to receive great reviews on Tripadvisor and was able to improve the current 3 out of 5 stars of this pub by using the same techniques I used at TGIF.\n\nThe second red flag should have been the fact that Peter offers the job within 10 minutes of the interview, Super happy, I took the job and let him know I would give 2 weeks' notice to TGIF as I always find 2 weeks' a professional courtesy. He explains very abruptly that legally I only have to give one week's notice as I didn't work there for a year yet. I explained how the rota was out and that it would be nicer if I would give it 2 weeks. He scoffed but agreed to see me in 2 weeks.\n\n2 weeks later I started my new job as a bar supervisor. The red flags didn't stop.\n\nPeter was a master micro-manager with bad customer service and a bad temper. Just the sort of person you want as your manager. Here are a few of my favourite things that he did...\n\nThe Cellar alarm was going off (carbon monoxide detector) Gas leak somewhere in the cellar, which was from one of the bartenders not being able to change the keg. The manager sees me and tells me to go in and open the door, which I do straight away. Then I go to fix the problem, and he then tells me to f off and go back to the bar. which I do, 5 minutes later he comes to the bar and shouts at me in front of the customer that I was currently serving, \"why didn't you close the F-ing door\". then storms off. The customer asks me what was that about. I say, \"I have no clue\".\n\nAnother time, He decides that the family that is enjoying their meal, that the kids have dropped a few peas on the floor so he brings the table a dustpan and brush to clean up. The table had their mouths full and thought he was just doing a check back to make sure the food was ok. you can see them doing the awkward smile and nod. This was until Peter told them to clean the floor, I'm not paid to clean up after your kids. The family thought he was joking. When they worked out he wasn't joking they stopped eating and cleaned the floor. They left so quickly after they finished.\n\nThe supervisor before me had quit because Peter was saying he was going to get them done for stealing, he bragged about the fact if they stayed he would have pressed charges. The more he said this and the more I thought it could be Peter just setting up this person for theft but I had no proof.\n\nOne time he accepted 2 £50 notes (which are not only rare but are very known for being fake) the 2 notes he accepted looked like bad photocopies of monopoly money, you could see they were fake from the next city over. Strange enough he told me to do my 1st and only banking that day. The Bank didn't accept these notes as they were not real. I made sure to take pictures of them before I left to cover myself in case he was trying to stitch me up.\n\nThis one night everything was falling apart, the kitchen had a 2-hour wait. Due to some weird policy that Peter decided to make that night. Not 100% sure what the policy was, but it was something like completing the first check before starting the next. but the best thing was Peter was sitting at tables telling them it was a 20-minute wait. At one point I was standing in the middle of the dining room apologizing to 4 tables at the same time as they were all complaining about the 2-hour wait. On top of this, I was due to go home about 2 hours ago. it was a shit show, this was the night I decided to quit.\n\nhere is a review from that night;\n\nAte there today with my wife and 2 children. Waited an hour and 15 mins for the first course. When I approached the bar to find out where our dinner was, I was met by a nice chap who said he would find out. Within 10 mins of being sat down, a lady approached us with our receipt and asked what the problem was. I explained we were still waiting for our food but she snubbed us and said “would you like me to tell the kitchens your ready for it” Can’t think of a time when I’ve ever been to a restaurant, ordered food, paid in full and then had to tell staff when we wanted it delivered?? Whilst continuing to wait it was interesting overhearing the conversations this waitress was having with other staff about all the complaints they’d had and how they will continue to get bad reviews if they don’t change things. Approached the bar again asking for our food and could hear lots of swearing by a chap in a pink polo shirt from the kitchens and so decided to ask for a refund. The nice chap who originally chased the food order up didn’t hesitate in refunding me in full whilst explaining how he should have been home hours ago. The only saving grace to this god-awful place is the nice guy on the bar. First and last visit for us.\n\nI was the nice chap, Peter is pink shirt. There are many other great reviews, I couldn't help the reviews of this place because the landlord was mentioned in nearly every one for his bad customer service.\n\nSo here is the Pretty Revenge.\n\nI know I was going to quit and I had another job lined up I told them I wanted to give this place 2 and a half weeks' notice, which would make me leave, the day before Father's day. The busiest day on the books due to the day and the fact there was a promotion running.\n\nBut instead of giving in my notice, and letting them have 2 and a half weeks, I decided to finally listen to Peter and give them the legal requirement of 1 week. I waited a week and a half to give them my notice, making sure he was understaffed for the busiest day of the year.\n\nApparently, it was a complete mess on fathers day! Looking at the reviews he was sacked within the next 6 months. 4 years on The pub has now changed its name, and looks like it's doing ok.\n\nI still chuckle when thinking back to him saying I can't leave, YES Legally I can.",

In particular, I spent a lot of my money on my nine year old daughter and she deserves in 100%. She has been pushing herself in school, helping around in the house without being asked, and always being the kindest soul you'll ever meet.\n\nHowever, when my mother in law came early in the morning and saw how the gifts under our tree were much more than usual she asked why. I told her I bought everyone a bunch of gifts, including her. She then preceded to ask how much gifts I got my daughter and I told her about 3 big gifts and 3 mini ones. Apparently, this outraged her because she started saying that a nine year old did not deserve that many gifts and she would be taking away the gift she bought my daughter so that my daughter wouldn't be too spoiled. I told her that was unfair especially since my mother in law promised my daughter a doll for Christmas and my daughter was looking forward for it. My mother in law said let it be a lesson to my daughter that in life she cant get all things she asks for.\n\nLook I understand that, but its not like I shower my daughter in gifts everyday. And if anything Christmas is the day you are supposed to spoil your children. But my wife told me to let it go and it was her mothers gift and therefore she could do anything she wanted with it and her mother agreed saying it was her right.\n\nAnd if we were going to play with that ideology then so be it. I decided to remove the 600$ designer bag I got my MIL, the thing I knew she wanted the most, and gave her a 40$ robe instead.\n\nOnce my MIL opened her present she was disappointed asking if that was all from me, because everyone else got increasingly more expensive gifts from me. And I said yes and apologized if I disappointed her but we cant always get the gifts we hoped for.\n\nThis left both her and my wife extremely furious, but hey the MIL got enough gifts I wouldn't want to spoil her!",

I also asked if there's any counseling service and there is so thanks for the nugget of advice.\n\nFor all the people concerned about me being dependent on her financially, don't be. I have about 150k that I collected around the years from odd jobs and competitions. My friend has also assured me that they're going to find me a job. \n\nMoving on to the update:\n\nI went through with it. I hit the send button the moment I was out of the immediate area and I have been getting bombarded by emails and texts and phone calls since. After a while, I blocked most people. \n\nApparently, from what our neighbors kid is telling me, my mother is losing it. Thank goodness that she doesn't know where exactly my friend lives or I guarantee you she would be here. From what I heard, she's being bombarded with calls from family and friends. Our neighbors are pissed (for now. They're wet blankets that I have no doubt will bend in a few weeks.)\n\nThe kid says they heard yelling and things crashing. They went to check it out and apparently she broke the glass living room table. Understandable. I don't care since I'm not there and I don't have younger siblings who will be affected. \n\nI'm glad I did this because it's relieving to finally let it all out. I have lived under this roof for 19 years, and it is almost surreal to let people know what was going on under there. I don't expect to believed, because after all, they only saw the good mum act. You don't go from that to believing she's awful easily, no matter what you hear. But I needed to do it, for me if nothing else.\n\nIt was surprising to find out that some people believed me?? I went into this mostly for catharsis and chaos. But some relatives and one of my brothers actually support me! My brother even said I can crash at his whenever I need it and honestly I'm grateful.\n\nAs for the people who told me I'm just like my mother, I will repeat what I said before: I hope you stub your toe and then right before it stops hurting, you stub it again for the rest of forever. I hope every restaurant you go to serves cold food that tastes like dirt. Have a nice day.\n\nAs For releasing the videos/audios online, I will be do so once I'm settled and feeling comfortable enough to do so. I ask you to understand that it's a highly person matter and you only know glimses from what I said. Putting onto the internet, outside of the little bubble of people that I can just block and won't have to hear from again, guarantees that they will follow me wherever I go, even years from now. I already had this reddit story come up on my fyp on TikTok mere hours after posting it. I need time to come to peace with the fact that if I do make the records public, they will be there forever. \n\nSo, give me time. That's all I ask for now.",

I was bored so I kicked a pillow. Not hard, not at him, i just kicked it on the ground. He did not say or do anything that suggested me to stop. Then I kicked again. This time, he got up and grabbed the pillow. He walked to the stairs and I followed him. He then threw the pillow up but it came back down. Then he hit me in the face with it, hard. Out of nowhere, he didn’t even say anything. I was pretty surprised and a tiny bit scared because he has acted like this before. So tonight, while everyone is asleep, I’m gonna take the pillows. And I’m going to hide them somewhere he will literally never find them.",

One of my really close friends happened to be trans and after a while she decided she wanted to be out publicly so she told alot of people like her teachers and some less close friends who didnt know one of these people being our manager. now our manager was around 60ish not the nicest person as she was stuck in old ways and attitudes. after my friend told our manager she was trans and that she will be going by *perfered name* now and is no longer *deadname* and asked if it could be changed in the system because she didnt want to see her deadname on the order screens. our manager just kinda laughed and said it was out of her control to change the names (it wasnt). our manager also refused to use her prefered name when talking to her and kept misgendering her.\n\nNow the revenge. our manager went by her middle  name and not her legal first name as she hated her first name. after 6 months of working there I got sick of all her drama and transphobia so I put in my 2 weeks by leaving a formally written letter on her desk adressed to her first name. also for added revenge I quit when she was really short staffed because half of her staff quit or got fired around the same time because of her.\n\ntldr: transphobic manager who was deadnaming my friend got called a name she hates.",

I unfortunately ended up spending a lot of time with her for various reasons, until I finally went very low contact with that side of the family once I got older. She was super spoiled, my grandma's favorite and the Golden Grandchild, while I got to be the scapegoat/black sheep. Not a fun part of my childhood.\n\nAnyway, my cousin was obsessed with Barbie. This was back in the days when Barbies were not light and soft. They were solid, hard plastic *weapons*. My cousin would constantly crack me in the head with Barbies. Between my grandma and her parents, she had a million of the fucking things, and I always had to play Barbies with her even though I fucking hated Barbies, or else she would launch into a massive tantrum. I figured I was going to get nailed in the head with Barbies anyway, so I just went along with it and was as boring as humanly possible. Naturally, I got the worst Barbies and the worst clothes. It wasn't the only nasty thing she did to me by far, but it is the one that's directly relevant to this story.\n\nI don't remember what the last straw was. I don't remember why I snapped. I'd gotten past the point of crying or reacting to anything she did because my aunt and grandma would just punish me for lashing out at her after I put up with too much of her abuse. So I had been keeping it bottled up for a while. What I do remember is what I did as revenge. I think I was about 8 years old.\n\nOne night that I had to sleep over, I waited until she fell asleep and then snuck into the play room. Then I went through all of the Barbie shoes and carefully tossed out one shoe from a few matching pairs. I didn't do the whole lot of them because I thought that would be too obvious. But I did enough of them that it was going to be a problem, and I made sure I got at least one or two of her favorite pairs.\n\nI left the next morning and forgot about it, until the next time I visited and overheard my aunt telling my grandma over the phone that she was sick of Barbie shoes and all of Barbie's tiny accessories because they always get lost, and she'd gone through the entire vacuum cleaner bag but hadn't found a single shoe. \n\nI never told a soul.",

I was upset that she was constantly yelling at me and she was upset that I often stayed up past 1 am (my most productive hours for programming). She came up to yell at me and I told her I didn't want that and it was stressing me out\n\nanyway, argument aside\n\nshe started packing a massive suitcase and said she was leaving, so of course I had to calm her down and all that stuff, which did work and she did stay. Later, we worked out the issues also so we're both happy now. With other people. No, no, that part's just a joke. I proposed to her a bit ago and we're planning a wedding\n\nanyway, the petty revenge part. The suitcase was insanely heavy because she has a tonne of clothes. Thing was probably \\~50 lbs / 23kg on its own. As part of her threat she had brought her massive suitcase upstairs. After I calmed her down I figured she'd probably pull that stunt again pretty soon (it was super effective). After I brought it back down, I put an extra 30 lb / 13kg dumbbell in there and hid it between neatly folded clothes\n\nShe never made the threat again, but she did eventually have to move her suitcase and she wondered why it was so much heavier than she remembered. She thought I had messed with it somehow and opened it, but didn't search around long enough to find the dumbbell. So this 100 lb 5'2 woman had to drag an immensely heavy suitcase back upstairs to her room and only when she started taking the clothes out did she find the dumbbell\n\nShe laughed about it when she told me so it was wins all around",

Originally we weren’t, but my husband made a deal with me that if he could find out we would keep up the guise we didn’t know. I agreed and now we both know we’re going to have a girl. My husband is the 5th first born son to have his name so everyone on his side and most of my side is convinced that baby is a boy (which makes sense). For the most part my husband and I just giggle about it but when it comes to his dad I get an unhealthy sense of pleasure knowing I’ll “ruin” the streak of first born sons. I doubt having a granddaughter will make him less of a sexist but I am quite sure he’ll be devastated that the “line” ends with my husband. Now every time he makes these remarks I have to bite my tongue not to throw it in his face. I’m really trying to be less petty in general but with this I just can’t seem to help myself and wanted to get this petty pleasure off my chest.",

        "text": "English isn't my first language, so feel free to correct any bad grammar. \n\nI work in the small hotel at a front desk. Most of the time, we do not have many customers who want a a meal, so we don't have a full time waiter. When we expect more than 20 people per meal, we call a waiter. When waiter isn't around here, we also tend the bar, wash and polish the glassware, serve food etc. Restaurant area is cleaned by anyone who does not have another work to do at that moment. In our working area behind the bar we have a printed list of all the waiter's duties, including (but not limited to) washing and polishing *all* the glassware, cleaning and mopping the restaurant, cleaning the bar, taking out trash etc. \n\nIt's worth noting that waiters are paid per meal, not per hour, and when all the guests finish their meals, the waiter just have to finish his duties and he is free to go. Their wage per meal is bigger than my wage per whole eight hour shift. \n\nOur regular waiter (let's call him Jim) isn't in town for a month, so two of his friends are coming instead of him. Those people are a couple, let's call them Mike and Mia. They both came to work with Jim on a few occasions, when we had a large groups, so they are familiar with the bar and dining area, and, of course their duties.\n\nJim has never complained about the work, he would always wash all the glasses and cups, and he always leaves the restaurant and the bar impeccably clean. But Mia and Mike obviously do mind doing their job properly.\n  \nLast week, I found a dozen dirty glasses and ashtrays when I arrived in my afternoon shift. Mia worked that morning, and refused to wash those dishes because \"she didn't serve the dinner last evening, so it's not her job\". I told my colleague about that, and she told me that Mike refused to clean the floor couple of days ago, and that she already told our manager about that. Our manager probably spoke with them, because we saw them both cleaning the floor after their shifts, but they didn't seem too happy about that.\n\nThis Tuesday we had a group for dinner, they told us to expect them around 8 pm. Mia came at 7 to set the tables. There was some delay, and when people didn't show up in 8.30, she tried to pick an argument with my colleagues - \"why are they late? Where are they? It's late, can't you call them? Who is responsible for this? I'm told that dinner will be served at 8pm, it's 8.30, I have other things to do, **whose fault is this**???\"\n\nA colleague of mine calmly explained that this is a hotel, not a jail, and that we can't call the guests to order them to show up immediately or else. But all of us were fed up with them at that point. \n\nThe next day, Mike was doing the lunch, and Mia the dinner. Mike warned us that he has some appointment at 4 pm, and told us that Mia will finish the dishes and the cleaning before the dinner. OK, we don't care. Luckily, these guests arrived a little early, so he managed to finish almost everything, leaving only a few dirty glasses in the sink. He came to front desk to take his money, and then gave me a bill and told me: \"I sold a beer to some moron\". I looked up and saw one of our regular guests sitting in the restaurant and drinking a beer. I mean WTF, this guest is really great guy, I can't imagine him doing anything that would provoke such a reaction. I almost lost my shit, but there were another guests in the reception area, so I just said \"OK, see you tomorrow.\"\n\nLater that afternoon I took a tray and picked up every single dirty glass, cup, pitcher and ashtray I could find in the rooms and all around the hotel, and put them in and around sink in the bar (there wasn't enough room in the sink). The look on her face when she saw all the dirty glassware was priceless, but she still had to wash and polish *everything*. We haven't seen them since then, I really hope that they will refuse to work when our manager call them again. ",

I had moments like the ones mentioned above and lots more of her talking shit about neighbors/ friends/ her own eldest child behind their back.\nTonight, I'm packing for uni. \nBy morning, the whole folder will reach multiple people, including my half siblings, aunts uncles, neighbors, her \"besties\" etc. \nBad luck, and worse day mother. You always said Justice is better served cold.",

They were 100% okay with that and even offered to be my reference for the new job.\n\n\n\nSo here comes the new job, my old job refused to be my reference because they were being petty that I was leaving. I ended up quitting and getting the new job without their help. My old job didnt invite me to their xmas party even though they said they would and theu have been bad-mouthing me to everyone.\n\n\n\nSo i did what I do best....i made multiple fake accounts and wrote bad reveiws under their company. I know its petty, but I almost didnt get my new job because of them. They'd rather I struggle. So now they can too.",
