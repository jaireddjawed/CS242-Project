Lots of two month old accounts stealing answers from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5v7ip3/what_do_people_think_is_good_only_because_of/). I think it is probably to later sell the accounts with a lot of karma to be shill accounts for some companies or political parties.\n\nWhat do you think they do it for? I've tagged them on RES as possible shill accounts to be sold, would be great if some others could do the same and after some time we might see them post as shills. Then we could be certain that such thing exists on Reddit, as the best way to make sure is to see it with your own eyes.\n\nEdit: Here's an example of one: http://i.imgur.com/UHkZ11g.png",

        "text": "You might have seen /u/goodbot_badbot collecting data about bots and how popular they are. The bot saves data about bots and the amount of \"good bot\" and \"bad bot\" replies they have gotten, and then[ranking](https://goodbot-badbot.herokuapp.com/) the bots.\n\nHowever, this bot was only useful for a couple of days, before it got abused and the rankings got severly skewed.\n\nI will go over:\n\n1. How the bot ranks other bots,\n2. How the bot/ranking got skewed,\n3. What went wrong and\n4. What could have been done better\n\n***\n**1. How the bot ranks other bots**\n\n/u/goodbot_badbot checks for comments with either \"good bot\" and \"bad bot\", then checks for the parent comment and sets the counter for the parent comment author plus one.\n\nThe actual ranking is done with *Lower bound of Wilson score confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter*, which is [this](http://www.evanmiller.org/images/average-rating/equation.png) equation.\n\n***\n**2. How the ranking got skewed/how the bot got abused**\n\nThe first couple of days after the bot went online, there was little to no abuse going on; the rankings were organic.\n\nSoon after however, several subreddits started to inflate the rankings for their bots, by creating threads with the single purpose of calling the bot and making votes.\n\nExamples:\n\n- [Marvin is currently second place for best not in the good bot/bad bot contest! Let's get him to #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/6nm7jp/marvin_is_currently_second_place_for_best_not_in/)\n\n- [Good Bot RedditSilverRobot](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditSilverRobot/comments/6o9wlc/good_bot_redditsilverrobot/)\n\n- [BAD BOT](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittydarksouls/comments/6oemid/bad_bot/)\n\n- [Remember to vote for u/roboragi in the Good bot competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightNovels/comments/6ofg9u/remember_to_vote_for_uroboragi_in_the_good_bot/)\n\n- ... and many more\n\nWith some of these vote manipulation posts having more than 500 comments, being about `500 / 2 = 250` votes.\n\nIf we take a look at the [current rankings](https://i.imgur.com/aPmLk4b.png), we can see that [Roboragi](https://reddit.com/u/roboragi), [DeepFryBot](https://reddit.com/u/DeepFryBot) and [The-Paranoid-Android](https://reddit.com/u/The-Paranoid-Android) are the Top 3 bots.\n\nFrom the top 3 bots, [The-Paranoid-Android](https://reddit.com/u/The-Paranoid-Android) is the 3rd place. [The-Paranoid-Android](https://reddit.com/u/The-Paranoid-Android) is also (how I saw it) the most vote-gamed bot. That being said, 1st and 2nd place are most likely also skewed, however no threads have been created for vote skewing, most people replied with \"good bot\" no matter what the bot did.\n\n***\n**3. What went wrong**\n\nThe fact that /u/goodbot_badbot replied to every comment saying \"good bot\" / \"bad bot\" did not only spam many subreddits, but also opened the gates for users to abuse the voting system.\n\nAs far as I know, the bot also allows an infinite amount of votes per user / per bot. This would be *a major* flaw. Also the bot doesn't check for \"vote party\"-threads, which could be identified by the title, if the goodbot_badbot is mentioned in the submission text etc.\n\n***\n**4. What  could have been done better**\n\nBasically fix everything in **3.**, but the system could have been set up a different way.\n\nThe /u/goodbot_badbot could have counted voted on reddit for e.g 180 days, and then posting the results; **without** announcing that it is counting votes.\n\nThat way, people wouldn't abuse the voting system, didn't know their comments mattered, and the results would have been much more organic, and in return more accurate.\n\n***\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe /u/goodbot_badbot [ranking](https://goodbot-badbot.herokuapp.com/) started out with good intentions, ended up spamming subreddits and being vote-gamed by not implementing anti-vote-spam measures. Subreddits and bot owners called users to vote on their bots.\n\nWhile the current [rankings](https://goodbot-badbot.herokuapp.com/) may give a rough overview of the bots' popularity on reddit, the 1st to 3rd place are severly skewed.\n\nA better alternative to the whole ordeal would be to count votes in the background, and after e.g 180 days posting the results.\n\nThe fact that the bot announced every single vote as counted, it opened the floodgates to \"vote-parties\".\n\n***\n**Further work**\n\n- I want to test if the use of the terms \"good bot\" and \"bad bot\" went up after /u/goodbot_badbot went online.",

        "text": "I hang out a lot on various suggestion boards, mainly /r/gamingsuggestions and /r/animesuggest. I mostly give suggestions myself, but sometimes I ask for stuff there as well. The latter I do very rarely, though. Why? Because I noticed that, generally, people on reddit suck at giving recommendations. \n\nWhenever I enter a thread, where someone asks for media recommendations under specific criteria, or make such a thread myself, there's 95% chance none of the suggestions will fit what the OP is (or I am) looking for even remotely, or fit, but only on a superficial level.\n\nAnother problem I'm encountering is lack of creativity. On every suggestion board, there's always a few popular suggestions that get mentioned constantly, and people go out of their way to somehow fit them into the OP's request, instead of suggesting something that could fit better. Very rarely you see people actually suggest something different than those 5-6 titles that are popular on the subreddit, on repeat. On top of that there's also the everpresent problem of the \"hivemind\", which in case of suggestion subs sucks especially, since actually good suggestions often don't get upvoted at all, while yet another Witcher 3 recommendation gets a billion upvotes, even though it doesn't even fit the request because the OP was looking for a space 4X strategy game...\n\nAnother very annoying thing about the suggestion-based communities is that they don't respect others' taste. People will downvote OP's comments for simply stating that the suggestion he's been given isn't what he's looking for, or entire threads just because they didn't like what the author was asking for. There are times where the suggestor gets pretty aggressive, too, defending their suggestion as if their life depended on it, trying to convince the OP that his taste is wrong and he should try the suggestion anyway. \n\nAnd you know what's the funniest thing about it? I'm pretty much only encountering those problems on reddit. Whenever I ask for game/anime/movie/whatever recommendations on other sites, it's smooth sailing in 99% of cases, whereas on reddit I pretty much have to go through this shit on a daily basis. \n\nWhy is it that people on reddit are so bad at giving recommendations and refuse to get any better at it? You'd expect forum boards dedicated solely to suggesting and asking for suggestions to have some sort of level to them and actually provide sound help, but in reality it's the exact opposite.",

        "text": "Hey ToR! I don't know if any of you are aware of the LSE Impact of Social Sciences blog, but it's basically a site which tries to take academic work and make it relevant and accessible to wider audiences.\n\nI recently did some work developing some digital methods for analysing various aspects of Reddit communities, specifically the genealogy and spread of words. I used it to track how \"cuck\" spread across Reddit and how it picked up particular connotations, but the techniques I used are probably more generally applicable for anyone interested in drilling down into different communities here.\n\nThere's a piece up on the Impact blog here, in case you're interested: http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/02/new-digital-methods-can-be-used-to-analyse-linguistic-terms-and-better-understand-reddit-communities/\n\nIf you read the [FiveThirtyEight article about The_Donald](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dissecting-trumps-most-rabid-online-following/) a while back, you might be familiar with the \"subreddit algebra\" technique that lets you track the overlaps between different subreddits in terms of commenters and language. I used that to try and understand whether there are different \"constituencies\" in T_D, but there are a couple of other techniques I developed using the Reddit comments dataset in /r/bigquery and tinkering with scripts that others posted for using with Google's BigQuery platform (which is amazing, btw - lets you interrogate *massive* datasets for free or very little money, incredibly quickly).\n\nI thought ToR might find this interesting. I'd really like to see more social science and data-driven research into Reddit, given how little of it there is around (there's, I think, [one book - by Adrienne Massanari](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Participatory-Culture-Community-Play-Formations/dp/1433126788), which is very good). This site is the 4th biggest in the US now, and it's creating communities that are spilling out and having effects on the wider world. We should probably try to understand it better.\n\nLooking forward to chatting about this in the comments :)",

This is more of a relaxed look at bots on political subs bc they are a good example, so... pls no ban. I've linked everything via non-participation as well, so don't be rude and brigade.\n\n[Heres the post](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6qjaz7/hahahahaha_the_mother_of_the_disabled_child_that/)\n\nIt currently has 10,755 upvotes by about 6 hours after posting, which is a lot but nothing strange. However, the post is only 50% upvoted, meaning that the 10,755 total upvotes are a mere fraction of the total votes. For context, a post with 10k upvotes and 51% upvoted would mean the 10k upvotes reflect only (51%-49%=2%) of the total vote count. This puts the total number of votes for such a post at 500k votes. \n\nIf we presume the TD post is 50.5% upvoted, thats 1.08 million votes. 50.25% upvoted -&gt; 2.16 million votes, etc. \n\n[This website](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit-stats/) puts the average number of daily reddit votes at 25 million site wide. Is a single TD post really pulling 10% of daily site traffic in only 6 hours?\n\nIt also helps to consider bot behavior. A simple upvote bot that continuously increases votes is obvious and suspicious. Instead, bots downvotes as well as upvote to cause a net positive vote total while being much harder to detect. A shitty bot like this would put in tons of votes where just barely more than half of the them were positive. \n\nSee where I'm going with this?\n\nCompare the TD post to the other top ranking posts at this time and decide for yourself.\n\n[This top post](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/6qk3re/primitive_technology_sandals_primitive_technology/) with 22.8k net positive with 90% upvotes\n\n[Or this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6qjmuw/norway_close_to_midnight_no_lights_needed/) with 39.1k net positive with 91% upvotes",

Unsurprisingly, many of their posts are either directly or indirectly channeling traffic through to their website, which is soft paywalled.\n\nThe general reception of these posts has been very positive, with many of their comments receiving gilding and responses thanking them for their service in the name of free speech and hard journalism.\n\nI find this to be interesting given how negatively reddit generally responds to the presence of corporate shilling and self promotion. There are obvious exceptions to this rule, such as the Katie Pornhub user account, and celebrity AMA accounts. However historically most attempts at obvious marketing are quickly downvoted to oblivion on reddit.\n\nAlso important to note are the reddit native ads that WaPo has been leasing during the same timeframe, as well as a proliferation of posts from the site all over the major news subs and the promotion of the official Washington Post subreddit.\n\nIs this an example of a changing trend on the site with regards to the reception of corporate representation, or is it specific to WaPo, either as a reaction to recent events or due to an insider relationship between the publication and reddit?",

        "text": "**Update:** Turns out this probably has to do with the new onboarding process for the Reddit app. You can see similar increase in subscriber counts for formerly stagnated subreddits like /r/atheism as well. Thanks to /u/jippiejee for the info.\n\nI noticed that /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu recently started gaining subscribers at a rapid pace despite four whole years of losing subscribers slowly as seen [here](http://redditmetrics.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu). At first I thought maybe this could be explained by students being off school for the past two months, but I doubt that's the case because summer didn't affect the subscriber counts in any past years. I'm not aware of any algorithm change in the past few months that could cause this, but please correct me if there were.\n\nHowever, even if that were the case, I feel the increase of about 100,000 subscribers in two months would be reflected by an increase in activity, but it's not. The front page still has a post, not even a particularly popular one, from 27 days ago. If you check back to when the growth started two months ago, you'll find only 39 posts have been made in that time, meaning less than one per day. The craziest thing is that total number of upvotes on those posts is less than one third of the subscribers gained in that time (I'm not actually sure if this is normal but I don't think it is since Reddit stopped vote shaving as much). Because of this I think the growth in subscribers is possibly artificial.\n\nI find it especially suspect because there is a period of from the 21st to the 24th where no posts were made, yet in that time the subreddit gained at least 5,000 subscribers. The only thing I can see causing this is popular thread linking to the subreddit, but the growth is in line with what it has been for two months so I doubt it.\n\nAnyway this is just something I noticed which seemed weird and wanted to see what someone else thought about it.

        "text": "[538’s subreddit analyser tool](https://trevor.shinyapps.io/subalgebra/) allows you to see what other subreddits people from a certain sub also browse. It compares the number with the number of total subs to produce a subreddit similarity score. The scores are weighted on how big the subreddits are, meaning you get a really good picture of what demographic or ideological crossover there is between subs. This is a seriously powerful and insightful little tool to understand and answer questions about what’s going on across reddit. For instance: Is uncensorednews all about providing news the reddit admins don’t want us to see or is it just a den of NeoNazis? The big data suggests it is the latter.\n\n\nI used the tool to see what the 100 closest subreddits to /r/TheRedpill were.\n\nAmid the obvious subs you’d expect, (MGTOW, AskTRP, mensrights, etc.) there are some very interesting subs which strongly suggest something about the psyche of your average Redpiller. \n\n#9 Steroids, #15bodybuilding, #16 PEDs, #17 Gainit, #21 supplements, #24 testosterone #33 steroidsourcetalk\n\nClearly this suggests redpillers are profoundly insecure about their appearance and many are ingesting questionable substances in order to look more muscular. Boys and young men in particular are under increasing pressure to appear muscular, and this is clearly hitting this demographic hard.\n\n#10 FatPeopleHate, #85FatLogic\n\nInteresting but perhaps unsurprising crossover between the Red Pill and people who hate fat people. The energy, dialect and feel of the place is very similar even if the content is different.\n\n#20 The_Donald, #57 Anarcho_Capitalism, #92Libertarian\n\nA clear and overwhelming trend towards right and far-right politics in the red pill, with no left-wing political subs at all to be seen. The opposite was true of /r/thebluepill, where progressive and far left subs like /r/socialism (#81) and /r/anarchism (#79) featured prominently.\n\n#30 AltRight, #46 European, #52 CoonTown, #68 WhiteRights, #77UncensoredNews\n\nThere was also a great number of overtly racist subs in the top 100 with a lot of crossover between NeoNazi-linked subs like those above and TRP. Needless to say, there were no anti-racist subs on there.\n\n#23 DeadBedrooms, #28 ForeverAlone, #35Incels (involuntarily celibate) #84ForeverUnwanted, #101 AmIUgly, #18 Tinder, #43OkCupid\n\nThis one was the most interesting theme to me. It is clear from the propensity of these sorts of subs that TRPs are profoundly lonely and very few are in relationships, still fewer in positive ones. It’s almost as if there could be something wrong with their views and actions that could be driving people away. Seriously though, it appears that many TRPs are deeply depressed and have serious appearance issues and have given up hope of love. It also suggests the tactics and behaviors TRP advocate do not work.\n\n#59 Sociopath,\n\nThis shouldn’t have been a surprise, given that the way TRP advocates treating women is basically the definition of sociopathic behavior.\n\n\n**TLDR**: Redpillers are sad, lonely, angry young men who have fallen down a racist, sexist, far-right rabbit hole and who would and do deserve pity if their actions were not so harmful to others, particularly women.\n\n\n",

But I have seen countless posts being downvoted for no reasons at all.\n\nFor each downvote that is given for a good reason, there are hundred downvotes given for a bad or no reasons. The abuse is far bigger than the use, and has itself become a major problem on reddit. I don't care much about voting systems at all, but if it is required, then at least remove the downvoting. No trolls on other boards have ever pissed me off more than the anonymous downvoting cowards on reddit. For me the whole purpose of making a post is to share thoughts and discuss, not getting upvotes. If nobody replies or nobody gives an upvote, that's something I can easily live with. But brats of all ages downvoting it gives me violent ideas.\n\nThere is a report function, and there are moderators who are actually doing their job. This is more than enough to take care of trolls and hater. Downvoting was originally meant as a tool against these people, but it has instead become a tool for the people it was meant to be used against.\n\nIf enough downvotes are given you post becomes invisible, or it never leaves the \"new\" section, which is why those who only read the \"hot\" section will never notice it. It's sheep mentality, and if a comment or post has zero points, many will either ignore it or give their own downvote. It is discouraging to know that your nest post or comment could end up being downvoted for no reason. Especially if you have put a lot of effort on it. When people who respect they expect respect in return, and downvote attacks is extremely disrespectful. If I stop visiting reddit, this is the main reason. It's the human factor, a law that says that once something becomes \"common property\" for everybody with an internet access, and there is one or more ways to abuse a function for other purposes than what it was meant for, then it is 100% sure that it will happen.\nIf someone posts an attack on you, at least you know who it is and can answer back. When anonymous creeps downvotes you, they are free to do so without risking anything themselves.\n\nEdit: This is what I'm talking about. Anonymous cowards who are downvoting my posts. If you need to downvote, at least have the spine to post a comment about why you're doing it considering this post is entirely on topic for the board.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/6omyy0/why_is_reddit_seemingly_obsessed_with_child/",
        "text": "One of the most noticeable aspects of Reddit’s  community is an obsession with child support and it’s misuse, any longtime user will notice the site is filled with anecdotes of Men being forced to fork over their hard earned cash to greedy mothers who only had children for the sweet money. Incidents of Men being forced to pay child support for children that aren’t their’s will gain scores of upvotes and attract an extraordinary amount of attention almost comically out of proportion to the occurrence of these incidents.\n\nA recent Ask-Reddit post asking the question “How would you feel about a law requiring parents that receive child support to supply the court with proof of how the child support money is being spent?” gained more than 70,000 upvotes and is the third most upvoted thread on the subreddit Askreddit. Most of the comments thankfully pointed out the unfeasibility of the suggestion and the can of worms that suggestion would open, but the sheer amount of upvoted that comment received indicates that there are two possibilities to explain this phenomenon.\n\nThe first that concerns about child support payments and their misuse are something close to the heart of most Redditors and the suggestion of a paper trail for child support was a unique innovative idea that they felt had to be upvoted to the top out of the blue\n\nNumber two would be that Child support is an issue close to the hear of a dedicated, well-organized minority that was able to use a combination of bot-nets and organisation to get this answer to the top of a subreddit\n\nIf the first is the case then I suspect that the main reason would be demographics as the  Reddit user base skews towards American white male educated millennials who probably have the most to loose to child support and are reaching the age where unexpected children are hitting their peers and they view it as a huge risk to their livelihood. This, however,  seems to be rather unlikely as Child Support isn’t much of a political issue in the united states of America with no mainstream candidate seeming to take any view on the issue rather than to leave it to the status quo. This leads me to conclude rather that the second scenario is the most likely explanation for this phenomena\n\nThe Reddit Karma system has a rather well-known flaw that has been exploited by numerous communities ranging from /r/Donald to /r/Neoliberal to gain massive karma despite the small real size of the community which is the fact that comments karma do not take into account proportion, only the net number of upvotes minus downvotes. This allows small well-organized and single minded communities to gain upvotes comparable to the biggest subreddit simply due to a better organisation.\n\nTo explain, let’s imagine that the question of bread with butter vs bread with cheese was a huge issue. There are 2 subreddits /r/bread_question and /r/bread_butter, The first has 50000 subscribers with split around 50-50 on the issue while /r/bread_butter has only 7500 subscribers. A pro-cheese post on /r/bread_question would only be able to get few hundred upvotes and vice-versa due to the split in the demographics and the fact that Reddit use is a sick joke more honoured in the breach rather than in the action. Meanwhile, pro-butter posts on /r/bread_butter could gain thousands of upvotes due to the lack of any dissenting voices. An outside observer might think that butter-bread was overwhelmingly more popular than cheeses-bread while in fact, they have similar popularity just one side is more organised than the other.\n\nThe phenomena become stronger when one considers that a large number of people might simply not have an opinion on the issue which allows for special interest redditors to make their view look like a massive majority via exploitation of the above phenomena, similar how to special interests group work in real life to impact public policy.\n\nIt is my belief, that there is a community of dedicates Redditor aided by misogynic communities such as /r/Kotakuinaction and /r/redpill who exploit the flaws of the Reddit algorithm that I have outlined above to move the overtone window more rightward via a propganda campagin that publicized incident of child support use as a mainstream shielf for other misognynitic viewpoints that would be downvotes if states outright",

Before it was 10+. \n\nIs this just people getting use to the status quo and slowly dwindling off or has reddit, on its back end, done something to tone it down (not saying censorship, but a change to what makes it to the top as regards political postings)\n\nI'm finally, after months, enjoying using reddit again.",
