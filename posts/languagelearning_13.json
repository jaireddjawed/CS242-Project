        "text": "Here is a good flash card app for learning vocabulary if you have an iPhone/iPad.  There are 28 languages available, and you can select any number of them to get the translations in all languages simultaneously.  You can tap each word to hear it spoken.  You can also add your own words and create your own sections (in the full version).  It comes with thousands of words and default categories already prepared.  There is a word grid comparing the words side by side, or a flash card section for studying words in any category you choose.  I personally prefer it to Anki because you can customize the content and have multiple language translations at once.  It's really good if you're working on multiple languages that have a lot of cognates that you mix up often.  I am the developer though so I am biased, but it works really well for me.  Take a look if you're interested.   \n\nHere is the link - [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polylingual/id1639800345](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polylingual/id1639800345), or search Polylingual on the App Store",

I grew up as bilingual with spanish and italian as my native languages + english at a bilingual school and have now gotten to a good level of fluency in russian and german. I am now wondering wether I should start some type of master or directly try to find a job, the thing is that it's really daunting to start since I don't even know which possibilities are out there 😓. I would love to have languages as the main focus wherever I work, however I'm not passionate about teaching, translating, being a touristic guide or call center positions and I can't come up with anything where knowing multiple languages is useful. Sorry if it was a little vague or I'm missing some info, make sure to suggest and ask anything that could be of interest, thanks!",

        "text": "Mostly copying and pasting this from a post I made in r/dyslexia with some edits for clarity!\n\nI’m looking for some advice in learning a language. I’ve been learning Swedish for around 3 years, and I’m pretty good at figuring out the gist of things when I’m reading and listening to it, but I struggle in other areas. I have issues with actually reading the sentences and knowing what each word means and I really struggle with speaking it and writing it.\n\nI think it’s related to my dyslexia because they touch on some of the things I struggle with most with my dyslexia—phonological awareness and verbal recall, which are both written in my report from when I got tested. Basically I don’t pronounce words correctly (even in my native language (English) I had to go to speech therapy for years) and even when I know how to pronounce them and try my best they don’t come out that way. For verbal recall, I find it extremely difficult to remember vocab, especially when I need to think of it myself. This is why I can get the gist of things but not remember what individual words mean, even if I read them 100 times and look them up every time. Again, this is not limited to learning a new language since it’s somewhat the same in English for me. Things either gradually or all of a sudden come to me outside of what I feel is normal “learning situations”. Since moving here I have learnt a lot through immersion, but I’m not sure how to tackle this now that everything seems to fall apart when I go to use it myself! I’m aware this might be related to confidence, but I’m also sure that it is not the main reason. \n\nAs for what I’ve done up until now, I’ve done your standard Duolingo course, then moved onto movies, TV shows, music etc. I can understand what’s going on as long as I have Swedish subtitles. IRL I can understand what they’re saying as long as I can “picture” subtitles in my head, if that makes sense haha. I played football with a Swedish team and they mostly used Swedish and I could understand pretty much everything by the end, but couldn’t speak it at all. I’ve tried with vocab cards but it never stays in my head, even if I do it consistently many times over. I’ve tried doing exercises and stuff too but it hasn’t helped much either. Reading books etc is pretty much out of the picture because even in English my comprehension is so bad due to my dyslexia I do not retain information more than a page later, unless I have a clear view of the “scene” in my head. Overall I’d put myself at B2 Reading, B1 Listening, A2 Speaking and Writing, if even that. \n\nI’m living in Sweden now (started learning 1.5 years before moving) and I feel like it’s holding me back, because even though most people speak fluent English, it doesn’t help me actually integrate. Any tips at all would be appreciated!",

I feel like it is almost more a psychological thing, as ifI don't completely trust that what I want to say is the correct grammar and so I use a tiny bit of time to analyse if what Im about to say it correct. \n\nDo you guys know of any specific excercises to help me with this problem, so basically the speed in which I talk? I do record myself regularly (which is how I noticed this problem) but I feel like the way I practice right now is too arbitrary.",

I've been learning German for the past 7.5 years, multiple Germans have told me they think I would pass a C2 test but have never actually taken a Goethe, TALC, DALF, etc. test.\n\nI was born and currently live in Montreal, where in elementary school up till 11th grade we were forced to learn French, so while I've been told I'm at a B2/C1 level in the language, I absolutely despise it for whatever reason (for some reasons inherent to the language and also the compulsory nature of learning the language in school with what I consider to have been pretty poor teaching).\n\nOn the one hand, I want to learn a new language. I've thought of Hebrew, Italian, Russian as possible candidates, mainly because each of them has literature I'd wanna read in the native tongue. However, I'm quite literally obsessed with German, (I exclusively read German literature, I have iTalki lessons 4-5 days a week, I watch German Twitch streams everyday, etc.) and I would be devastated if my German got worse through learning another language. So that brings me to my first question. What's the good balance for learning a new language while maintaining my grasp on German?\n\nMy second question is: I've listed three languages I'd like to learn. But! I have a pretty good level in French. I've tried many times to improve my French and it feels like I never found the right tutor in French the way I did for German. However, it seems like it would be a tremendous waste to abandon French when I am probably only 6 months to a year away from achieving a solid C1/C1.5. Do you guys think it's worthwhile to study a language that you don't like but you have a good grasp of, or would you say it's better to forget it and just move on to a new language from scratch?\n\nSorry for the long post!

        "text": "In this forum, it’s been mentioned multiple times by a number of users (and in particular by xanthic\\_strath, that eternal crusader against ignorance and darkness in the world) that a proficiency level of C2 is roughly equivalent to what a high-school native speaker should be capable of doing if this CEFR framework applied to him. In other words, a 16-year-old tyke should be capable of at least meeting the minimum standards of the C2 level. This is fairly reasonable given the standards of the CEFR, and for those hoping to achieve the level themselves, this kind of comparison should help them realize that it’s not really too daunting a challenge. \n\nIt’s worth stating of course that C2 proficiency, for a learner of a foreign language, is an impressive feat. And yet from the perspective of a native speaker, in whatever language that might be for you, it’s hardly an astonishing feat of the intellect. Do you find the minds and intellects 15- and 16-year-olds particularly striking or impressive? This is to say that a C2 level of proficiency is by no means mastery of a foreign language--by most definitions, it’s not even close. \n\nSo is there a level of foreign-language proficiency equivalent to what on the CEFR would be a D1, if the framework of the CEFR were designed for that? The answer is yes, and it exists [on the ILR scale](https://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/languages/FSI/Testing%20Kit/FSI%20-%20Testing%20Kit%20French%20and%20Spanish.pdf). On this scale, someone scoring what’s designated as an **S-5** is “equivalent to a highly eloquent, highly educated native speaker”. This person also has a native-like grasp of idiom and slang, so instead of a highschooler, think of an intelligent university graduate who can mix fluidly with every kind of socio-economic class without missing a beat.\n\nWhat I like about the ILR, in comparison with the CEFR, is that it makes no distinction between learners and native speakers, but uses the highly educated native speaker as the ultimate criterion to determine one’s ability to use the language. For that reason, most native speakers would not receive an S-5 on the ILR scale, because being a native speaker is not enough. You have to be highly eloquent and highly educated, as well. \n\n(In this sense, it’s also worth noting that your native-language proficiency establishes the upper limits for your second language. Unless you’re a strange outlier, you probably won’t end up speaking your second language better than your native one.)\n\nAn example of the difference between C2 proficiency, or roughly ILR level S-4, and ILR level S-5. \n\nC2/Level S-4: [https://vimeo.com/7296196](https://vimeo.com/7296196)\n\nLevel S-5: [https://vimeo.com/7296625](https://vimeo.com/7296625)\n\nWhile highly articulate and with speech approaching that of an educated native, the S-4 candidate exhibits some phonological traits and phraseology that wouldn’t be found in a native speaker of the language. The S-5, on the other hand, has speech, vocabulary, phonology, and fluency more or less indistinguishable from a highly educated native speaker.\n\nAnd here are some of the self-assessment criteria for the S-5 level on the ILR scale (and for English, substitute “your native language” if it isn’t English):\n\n· Do native speakers react to you as they do to each other? \n\n· Do you sometimes feel more at home in the language than in English? \n\n· Can you do mental arithmetic in the language without slowing down? \n\n· Is your vocabulary at least as extensive and precise as in English?\n\nI’ve written this post for descriptive purposes, and because the topic interests me. With that said, it should also serve to banish the silly notion that C2 proficiency is “mastery” of a language or “native level”, when really there are higher levels of proficiency to pursue (that is, if you’re into that). \n\nLastly, we can achieve more if we realize that formerly high standards are not as impressive when seen from the other side, very often after achieving them. There is always something more to improve.",

        "text": "This video got me thinking if I should experiment similar thing, that is to start learning my next TL, French, with a heavy focus of memorising as many vocabulary as possible. Although this might be against most language learning advices, there’s a reason for me considering this. \n\nI’m probably at a low B2 level for my Swedish and my 2 year journey looks something like the following:\n\nM1-6 Grammar as focus, basic vocabulary \nM7-14 Focus on reading, watching shows with TL subtitles on (which is still more reading than listening practice), some easy TL podcast. Building up vocabulary gradually. \nM15-20 Realising I still struggle a lot with listening, I listened to at least 3 hours a day of native content (regular podcasts) but didn’t see significant improvement. By this time I probably had a vocabulary of 800 words. \nM21-24 Took a break from listening exercises since I wasn’t getting much from it. I switched to Building up vocabulary more intensively by using Drops. My vocabulary increases at a much quickly pace and a broader range as well. I probably know now close to 2000 words. And at this point I realised a very significant improvement suddenly in my listening. And since I became better at listening I became more confident in my speaking as well. \n\nSo my theory is since I find Drops quite enjoyable and would it be worth to first reach 1000 vocabulary in French before even diving into grammar reading, listening etc? I feel that might help speed up the improvement of these other process at a much faster pace. Any thoughts on that?",

I know its not that easy to make a natural sounding conversation with complete beginner level of vocabular but still.. for example: in russian they use terms \"госпожа\\\\господин\" as equivalent to misiss\\\\mister but the issue is - we don't have these in russian at all. It's much better to refer to someone by their name or just like \"excuse me\" we don't use \"госпожа\\\\господин\" in conversations AT ALL. It's more for some sort of power game or sexual contests like \"she is my  mistress  😏 \" . yet all the converastion have these terms and it sound very awkward.\n\n i am just wondering, do other languages have this issue?",

        "text": "Many people on the forum have used Anki with success to retain vocabulary in their long term memory.   At the same time, many suggest we should not try to study but rather acquire a language instead which means memorizing goes out the window.  \n\nHas anyone seen any research on language acquisition for those that have brain injuries or issues with memory?    The book the Powerr of Habits talks about how people can develop habits in those types of cases even though they have no conscious memory.  Does language acquisition work in such a way?   \n\nIf they found any evidence of that, it would be a huge factor in proving Krashen right.",
