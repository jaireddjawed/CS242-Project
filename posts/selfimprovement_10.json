        "text": "So I think my father might be a narcissist. Since I was a kid he would make exchanges with me like \"If you go play your accordion in that place I'll give you this toy\". He'd also bring me to answer questions while arguing with my mom. I've witnessed their fights and were in a way compelled to feed it. He also has the need to be approved and thanked for everything. Lives out of the past and in every opportunity that he has, he'll say something that he accomplished. Any argument and he'll throw something that he did in my face. Like since ever. He used to do the same with my mother. The weird part is that he's also a very present father, would give me all he could, worries about me, helps me a lot to this day, although it seems like a codependency relation. I'll be getting back to therapy soon. I have OCD, anxiety, depression, and I think the way me and my family relate play a big part on me being barely functional.",

        "text": "Last night, I was despondent over work and life. I texted a friend saying that I felt so bad, like I was failing in life and there was no hope for me. He asked what I wanted emotional support or help? Confused, I asked him to elaborate what he meant by \"help,\" but I'd welcome any help he's willing to offer, thinking he'd say encouraging words to make me feel better. Instead, he went on to say that I had no emotional resilience to rejection and failures. He started to lecture me about life and job search and career setbacks. I was shocked, then enraged. I responded by saying that if I had no emotional resilience, I'd never have been able to complete my PhD in a country thousands of miles away from home. I'm hard on myself because I need to work twice as hard to reach my goals. On top of that, I'm chronically depressed.\n\nI understand that he meant well, thinking that by pointing out that I was overacting, I'd put things in perspective and feel better. In many cases, depressed and anxious people can't see things like normal people do, and small issues are magnified in our head. No matter how hard we try, or no matter how much medicine we take, there are always moments when a voice inside poison our brain with venomous words. That's when we want to seek out help from friends and family, to hear someone tell us: hey, I understand, it's okay, things will be fine. I'm sure in these times, empathy will save life. Just listen and show that you care, that's all we hope for.",

To put it into perspective, I live with very controlling and manipulative parents. It's been like this since I was a child but as I have gotten older it has gotten worse and worse.    \n\n\nI love my parents but they can never ever see what they do is wrong and how they treat me is wrong.   \nThey've always use the \"We're not bad parents, we have given you everything, roof over your head etc\". It makes me feel terrible because I never feel safe in my own home nor do I feel like I'm heard. They take care of my physical needs but they ignore what they do mentally to me.   \n\n\nI don't want to go into the details in case they find this post. But I can't deal w this and the only way things can improve for me is if I leave. So that's what I'm planning to do. But I cannot help but feel guilty, cause I know they're going to freak out and they're going to be upset. However, every one of my close friends and partner have even said they're manipulative and staying w them will only make things worse but this guilt is eating me up. Any advice?",

I have been in extreme kindness to the point of doing too much for others and neglecting myself to solve it. I couldn't get along with the people around me.\n\nBut since a few months I started to understand how to do better to balance between helping others take care of me and also accepting to be myself and trusting myself.\n\nI've been doing this for six months and I realized that I had a lot of friends in fact, that finally I was more beautiful than I thought and just as capable as anyone of succeeding in what I undertook. I met someone with whom I am happy since and I finally feel fulfilled in my studies too.\n\nI'm doing this post to say that the hardest thing is to trust yourself and act from your background. Having a good background is a big job but once you are there and realize it without neglecting yourself, you can become happy. Despite all this I often doubt everything dt I would need an outside opinion on this situation very briefly explained.",

It wasn't the vastness of space that freaked me out, I don't know what it was, but something about seeing other planets, and things from here ending up out there genuinely freaked me out.\n\nI know it's embarassing. I've done this with other things before but that was the most severe.

I hope you get what I mean by this.

        "text": "I've recently tried adopting some rules into my life to take me from my lowest point to what I hope will be not a peak. because peak implies it goes downwards from there. but rather. a constant state of improvement. these rules are \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1 No phone after 10 \n\neveryone loves their phone. it's where the majority of our lives take place. from emails to pictures to entertainment to videos. but it's a major distraction and addiction. There may be some very important things that can take place while you're asleep. but let's face it. Majority of the time. there really isn't. and a lot of the time it will just be us amplifying something that's not that important into something that is. the best thing to do in my opinion. put a bedtime routine on your phone where it denies access to apps and stops notifications that aren't calls or messages from your favorite contacts. stops you from endlessly scrolling on socials and lets you cool down and rest. a good dopamine break for the brain\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 wake up at 6 am \n\nthey say the early bird catches the worm and this isn't something I properly realized until putting in the effort to wake up earlier and actually seeing where that places me. most of the time if you wake up at that time, you're awake before anyone can be texting you so you can reply to text messages and emails without getting caught up in a conversation first thing in the morning meaning you can plan out what you need to get done in peace and start the day fresh while others might be wishing they were still in bed \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3 get in some morning cardio \n\none thing a lot of people don't realize is the benefits of getting the heart warm and pumping in the morning. once you find that feeling of pushing your heart rate right up and letting it slowly get down you understand what the runner's high is. for me, this used to be a 2 mile run in the morning around my area while it was still quiet. not having to worry about being judged. being alone but all my thoughts slowly go away as I just focus on going forward and breathing. this just made me more awake. conscious of myself. energetic. made me get fitter. which in turn made me feel better about myself and more confident \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4 do something and get out of the house \n\nalot of people fall under the trap of just staying at home all day if they have the chance. but even if you can get all your day's work done from home. try and go out. make each day a bit more interesting. have an activity planned or if not plan to go for a little walk to somewhere that you haven't been before. make a fresh memory. rather than just lazing about and getting stuck to a routine, if you finish work and have some free time. maybe walk a different route to the station. get some extra steps in. go to a class. learn a skill\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5 get rid of social media on your phone. \n\nsocial media can be nice to check but with the way, technology is now with tik tok and reels. is there really a need to have all those socials available to you on the go every second of the day, best thing to do here is if you have a laptop or tablet. keep your socials on there rather than about on your person. sure people may think you're weird for this at first. especially if you're younger, but trust me, you get used to it. it's something you can easily move past. if you have someone who you regularly talk to. give them your phone number and talk to them properly, and if they can't hold up a conversation without likes and snaps and all that involved. make the right choice for yourself and evaluate if you need to drop them \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6 learn to cook \n\nalot of people spend way too much money on either outside food or rely on eating meals at home that aren't the best and just resort to eating junk food when their alone cause it's easy. your body should be your temple. so put in a little effort. learn to make things you actually enjoy and give yourself some proper sustenance. give yourself the right nutrition. and save money. find out what your body likes and dislikes. experiment with different recipes and techniques. if you're so fragile in your masculinity that you're scared to cook. grow up. it's not that deep. look after yourself \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7 find an idea and go for it \n\nhaving something you are passionate about or something you can put the effort into chasing because you know it's something that you want to accomplish can make you such a better person. An idle mind is a dangerous mind that seeks stimulation and interest in other things. it's better to have your own thing. like a business idea or an invention idea that you can put effort into. if you're scared it's a waste of time because it won't go anywhere. so what. I'm not saying quit your job and put your 100 into it right away. but at least try something.  is the worst that could happen more interesting than the best thing that could happen \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8 Don't be a w\\*nker \n\nstop seeing out dopamine releases. whether it be self pleasure or junk food or endless scrolling on socials. all your doing is getting hooked on a chemical that is getting released without being earnt. you're losing out on the drive you could be having. Quit that stuff and get dopamine from things where you feel you really earnt it. use it as a hack to make yourself better \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9 read a book\n\nsure you can find any knowledge you need from a google search or hear any story you want in a youtube video. but theres something about sitting down and holding a physical booked and being isolated and just reading and enjoying a good book that is unlike anything else. having that time to yourself and recapturing your imagination and creativity and visualisation is something alot of people are losing out on \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10 make sure you get proper sleep \n\nsleep is essential to recovery. memory. helping our bodies feel better. and making sure we are the absolute best we can be for the next day. alot of people neglect their sleep by staying up late. waking up from raw sleep and feeling lethargic, and complaining, all because alot of the time they couldn't sleep because their brain is to use to being constantly turned on and mid day naps stop them from sleeping at night so you go on tik tok. just put in the effort and actually go to sleep \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbonus \n\nkeep a diary or journal \n\nhave a planner where you can keep tabs on what you need to do. When you have to do it. what you want to do. be able to flick back and see what you did do, keep track of progress and reflect and just be able to visualise time better and realise how much of a valuable commodity it is and how fast it goes away \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlearn a martial art \n\nmeet new people. learn something that teaches you discipline, respect. works on your fitness and mental endurance and keeps you going even when you feel completely gone. feel confident cause you know you have the ability to not only protect yourself but the ones you love and not have that need to prove yourself that some people do where they have to fight someone to feel better about themselves. get over that need for that adrenaline rush and train",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI’m M40 and have been single for about three months. I have divorced 5 years ago and since then, I have been in two relationships. \n\nI have noticed that being for some time without a woman, I loose inner peace and I just can’t keep focus on intellectual endeavors. I have been active in sports for more than 20 years and in the times like this, physical activities are my retreat. Besides sports, I have started investing more time in improving social skills and flirting. It is not the case that I have problems meeting women, but nevertheless, I want to improve this area of life.\n\nIn the past, usually breakups motivated me to grow and learn new things. Although heartbreaks have contributed a lot to my academic achievements and professional growth, diving deeper into the patterns, I have realized that although all the achievements, distracting myself with professional and academic pursuits made me feel empty inside.\n\nNow, to be honest, I am hungry for women’s company- even if it is just talk - I need it not to feel alone. On the other hand I am critical towards my behavior right now as I am way more soft than I had been in the past.\n\nI would appreciate if anyone shared the way you went through similar periods of life. Have you allowed yourself to invest more time in establishing new relationship first? Have you managed to restore the inner peace or was your discipline stronger than emotional tendencies?",

        "text": "Hello, I am a Canadian high school student, and as I progress through the 2nd term, I seemed to have noticed some things.\n\nA little background: I used to be a skinny kid. However, as the years passed, I began to gain wight. A lot of it. I now am 5,6 and 170lbs, nearly surpassing my dad. I never was an A+ student, however on good years I used to get 80-90 percent.\n\n1st term this year wasn’t bad. I got 75% in both of my subjects, which wasn’t bad, I kind of expected it going into high-school. I made some friends, and I was on good relations with most of my teachers. However, when 2nd term rolled around, everything plummeted. My grades worsened, my friends seemingly straying away from me, and me feeling more insecure about myself.\n\nI am getting a bit off topic, but the question remains: why am I so bad at everything? No matter how much I try, no matter the subject, I can’t seem to improve my skills on, well, anything. \n\nI try hard in my classes, really, I do. However , my grades seem to get worse by the day. I do all my work that I am assigned, but I just can’t seem to grasp the concepts explained in class.\n\nI have gym this semester, and it was just then that I realized how much I periled in comparison to everyone else in my gym class. Volley ball, hockey, doesn’t matter, I always seem like the worst athlete in my class. I want to work out, to better myself, and I try to, but I don’t have access to a gym (wights n stuff) and I can’t seem to loose wight, no matter how hard I work out.\n\nYou’d think I am good at something, right? No. I l like chess, but my ELO remains at 200. Socially speaking, I am slow. I can’t properly think of an answer. to please the asker in a conversation situation. It takes me a good five seconds to respond to something that a normal person would in under one second.\n\nGirls. Don’t get me stared on those. It might just be because of my lack of physical attractiveness, but I have never had a girlfriend. Ever. I don’t know why, but not one girl has shown even a sign of liking me. Never kissed, never even held hands. Despite my efforts, I have no “rizz” as the boys would say.\n\nHell, even video games I am bad at. I frequent war thunder, and I can’t seem to get more than a kill or two on a good day.\n\nMy question for you: what am I doing wrong with my life, and how can I improve? I can’t seem to figure it out, and I don’t want to ask anyone irl, they would just make fun of me (yes, even my parents) so I came to reddit, on the off chance anyone who can help me sees this. If you could help me, I would be very grateful . Thanks",

I am not afraid of working and I am not a lazy person. I worked for a year and never had any issues until now. \n\nAfter I got home from work yesterday I was a crying unhappy nervous mess. Checking the clock every 5 minutes to see how fast my day and night is going and how soon I have to go back to work. I ate a little can of stew for dinner and pretty much lost all hunger. The only reason I slept good was because I used so much energy in crying.  \n\nToday was my second day of work. I woke up a few times during my sleep but it was definitely better than yesterdays sleep. I woke up 30 minutes before I had to wake up and was not able to fall asleep again so I laid there for 30 minutes just checking my clock every few minutes waiting to have to get up. I got ready and left was pretty anxious but was slowly getting better. \n\nWhen I arrived I was feeling alright and then after an hour or 2 I was thinking negatively again. I hate being here I don’t wanna be here. I can’t take this or do this. I came to the conclusion that the reason I am upset was because of having to work 8 hours so maybe if I work less I will be happier. \n\nI ask my boss if they do part time. He said no not really but depends on the main boss then added saying he is happy he got a full time employee. (Meaning me) (I think he was thinking that I wanted him to hire a part time employee) I said I was thinking about switching to part time and he was surprised and asked why. \n\nWhen I started to tell him I instantly started crying but still was able to explain to him that I want to work here but I want to work less time. I said what if I work 5 hours and work my way up to 8 when I become comfortable. He asked his boss and he said I can do that. \n\nSo I was happy and excited and ready to leave work. When I was leaving I was in a very good mood and happy and then all of a sudden my hunger came back so I ate a lot of food. But then I was back to being negative. \n\nIt is now 2 hours later and I am still thinking negatively and being nervous anxious even tho I have gotten what I wanted. I told my mom and she was happy for me. I also have a doctors appointment tomorrow (26 hours from now). I still feel like garbage now. Someone please explain to me what is going on. Thank you to everyone who responded to my first part of the story.",

Every time I ask a girl or a guy if we can meet up, at university or outside I get told yes, then they change plans, or I just straight up get told no. (I haven't tried dating any girl after 1 girl agreed, then changed her plans and she never asked again). Maybe I am too blunt? It comes off as rude? or Arrogant? One of my friends told me he thought I looked intimidating because he thought I am really buff and just had this idea that I might be arrogant/douchey.\n\nI tried reading a few books, applied the advice and it worked! I know more people and people tell me I am confident, but no one seems to want to make plans with me...\n\nWhat's my problem?\n\nTLDR, I seem to struggle in building relationships at university maybe because I am blunt / Arrogant.",

        "text": "22 M. Over the past few months, life has gotten harder and harder. I used to be considered a prodigy, but lately it seems like I'm losing my mind little by little every day. I used to experience bullying at school because I was a cry-baby and people enjoyed making fun of me. Every day, I cried, whined, and complained as I made my way from school to home. I wasn't that tough. \n\nFast forward a few years, and I'm in high school. I'm intelligent, I have a few friends, and everything seems fine. What seemed to be bothering me though was my two or three close friends had a group or band, and I wasn't a part of it. I thought, \"Fine man, what's wrong with that,\" and would toughen myself. I successfully completed high school and entered college. I was a nice guy with a cheerful personality, a little shy, but active, and I had made a few friends. I had one particular girl in my life who treated me so well. I only thought of her as a friend and wasn't really into her. She used to call me at three in the morning and would share her sorrows with me. Being a kind person, I would listen to her and try to make her feel better. She gradually started to express her love for me and her growing liking for me. Me a stupid SOB who hasn't had heard those words felt goddamn good and I too started to be attracted towards her and liked her. I assisted her with every subject because she wasn't very versatile in any of them. After a few months of frequent communication during the pandemic, I discovered that she had a boyfriend whom she had been dating for at least three years. To say the least, I was shocked and it was very painful. However I still thought of her as a friend, though I tried to limit our regular conversation. Few weeks later, she needed my assistance with her online exams, but I was preoccupied and unable to provide help. Later that day, when she was crying, she called me and accused me of being selfish for not helping her. I felt bad for her and tried to talk to her, but she blamed everything on me. After that I fully cut my ties with her. As time went on, I started to see a pattern where my so called \"friends\" remembered me when the assignment was due. WTF!, I thought. And when I need help with some small stuff then everyone's gone. People keep taking advantage of me because I was so kind to them.  I've heard people backbiting me while act good in front of me. \n\nSince I was a young child, I have kept my weaknesses to myself out of fear that it will be used against me or that I will be laughed at for being such a pussy. Used to put on a brave face at day and cry myself to sleep. In addition to trying to comfort others, I kept my own fucked up life to myself. But as of late, I've severed ties with a great number of people in my life—or, to be more precise, many of them severed ties with me after their needs was was fulfilled. I now avoid letting anyone get too close to me. Even those who might genuinely care seem to be pushed away by me. Though I have made new friends, I act tough in front and assert my dominance to not let them put me under. As a kid I used to be weak physically, strong mentally but now I'm strong physically and weak mentally.\n\nNo matter how fucked up my life got I just tried to put on a happy face and face life head on.  I was so tough on myself for all these years that its now having a toll on me and now I feel like shit. The remedy was worse than the disease. Its effecting my daily life and I cant seem to complete a simple task and focus my head around small things. I don't use social media a lot, I don't post any sad status, and I don't let anyone know what I'm going through. Even normal conversation is beyond my ability now. I speak incoherently and jumble up words even when I'm speaking to my parents. I cannot seem to understand people's emotion and feelings. It's getting harder and harder for me to even start a relationship. All I know was I wasn't always like this. Lately I have days where when I suddenly feel like chocking on my own breath, with my hands trembling and my body sweating. I just know I have to fight this, but I have no idea how.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I feel like life is getting increasingly difficult. I used to be considered a prodigy, but now it feels like I'm losing my mind every day. I was bullied in school for being a cry-baby, which made me feel weak and unable to handle life's challenges. I cut ties with many people in my life as I felt used and taken advantage of. Even with new friends, I act tough and assert my dominance, but it has taken a toll on my mental health. I can't seem to focus on simple tasks, and my communication skills have deteriorated. I have days where I feel like choking on my breath, with my hands trembling and body sweating.",

I don't know precisely what job I want other than being an RA, or what I want socially (I do like having a lot of alone time, though I take too much of it), how to work/life balance. \n\nBasically, a lot of what I am learning and working on now most people learned 5-10 years ago. It's embarrassing, frankly. Though like I said, I wasn't my better self. But is it too late to live life? I have adopted a sort of \"roaring 20s\" mentality, where \"after\" COVID I feel life is short and I want to be part of it. But at my age range, most people are in careers, in serious relationships or married, have kids, and so on. \n\nI know it isn't technically \"too late\", but how can I go about living the life I missed out on in the drug induced haze of my early-mid 20s?",

Learning new languages, writing novels, learning music and arts and philosophy and science. I wanted to do well in studies and career and maybe starting my own business. But always I have had this fear that I can’t achieve it all or even a fraction of it all. I must hurry up. I must do many things at once. I used to work hard, find shortcuts, run away from unwanted responsibilities to be able to finish all my projects. Yet, I only finished a few. I have had burnouts and depression. Now, in my early 30s, I am either panicking that I have already wasted so much time and now there is even less time to achieve anything useful, or I am suicidal and can’t find anything to put efforts into. \n\nI feel like I am growing older and I will no longer be pretty and fit in a few years. But I really was never pretty and fit. I ignored health and beauty while trying to achieve those dreams I mentioned above. I kept postponing. Now I am panicking.\n\nI am in early 30s and I feel it’s too late for me to have children. But I am not stable relationship wise to plan to have kids. This makes me impatient with my partner about not acting responsible and supportive enough. And impatient with myself for not being strong enough and needing his help. \n\nAnd even though I want children, this gives me another pressure about not having enough time. Once I have children, my relationship, my own life, my career will all take back seat for a few years. So I must live my life fully before I have children. For example, I feel impatient if my partner does not spend time with me over the weekend or festivals. “There are so few of those days!! Why waste even a single one?” I know that’s not how life works, but I can’t get rid of these regrets….\n\nAnd recently, I feel like my parents are getting old and I feel this constant dread surrounding their health and well being. \n\nPlease help me get out of this mindset where I am constantly struggling for time, over committed, impatient and angry with anyone who wastes my time.

        "text": "I broke up with my girlfriend, or rather, we both broke up evenly because I didn't know how I felt about her. She said she would give me time to think about whether I loved her, and after I finished thinking, we would decide whether to get back together or not. She is incredibly understanding of my emotions and just wants me to figure things out, because she knows I have been struggling with this issue for a while. She loves me, but I just can't seem to reciprocate. At least all the time.\n\nI always treated her like I loved her. Always, no matter what. I never insulted her, and maybe that's why she fell in love with me. In those moments of being romantic, though, there would always be a part in the back of my mind that would think \"you don't really love her, remember that one time you found her unattractive? Or she did that one thing that sort of irked you?\"  I didn't know how I felt, and because of that, I felt guilty. I was always thinking about whether I loved her or not. I could never come to a conclusion, and in the end, I would be in turmoil. I felt that she had the right to know how I was feeling about her, so I was basically informing her throughout the past few weeks on how sometimes I heavily doubted the way that I felt. My conflicted feelings were taking a massive toll on my mental state, at some point, it would begin to affect us, and she 100% understood. She's amazing for supporting me, and she said that I can come back whenever I feel ready and figure out my feelings. She just wants me to be happy.\n\nJust to elaborate a little bit; on the one hand, I found her attractive. The moments we had together romantically were great. On the other hand, I didn't really like casual conversation with her anymore, at least not at certain points. There were some things that just irked me, and those swelled up. The problem with this is that those things that irked me are things that she has no control over and doesn't even make her a bad person. At all. It'll just be her repeating a phrase I found somewhat annoying for no reason, or something dumb like that. I've realized this now and I've seen the pattern. The pattern that this doesn't just happen with her.\n\nWith any of my previous relationships, platonic or not, this was a thing that happened. They would do something small, I would find it sort of unattractive, and I'd be unable to just move on and accept them. I understand everyone has their flaws, but I just can't seem to outweigh their good sides over their bad sides. At least a lot of the time. I feel like I'm unable to have any kind of romantic relationship because I will end up finding them extremely unattractive by the end for no reason.\n\nMy question is, how would I be able to see the good side in people more? How do I stop taking such small issues to heart, and letting them affect my state of mind so much? How can I make myself accept people's \"flaws\"?",

Sometimes, when we would arrive, I would refuse to get out of the car.

I don't really even know if I have any skills or talents. I don't have many experiences in doing things and feel as if I have to start from scratch at 25.

I want to share my story with you all today because I am in a very difficult situation, and I'm not sure what to do next.\nI'm just 20 years old, and like most people my age, I have big dreams and aspirations for my life. But unfortunately, my dreams are being held back by my circumstances. You see, the people in my town are very closed-minded and intolerant of anything that doesn't fit into their narrow view of the world.\nI've always felt like I didn't quite belong here, but things really started to go downhill when I began to express my desire to explore new ideas and ways of thinking. It seems that anything that deviates from the norm is considered taboo, and those who don't conform are ostracized and shunned.\nIt's been a lonely and isolating experience for me, and I feel like I'm suffocating in this environment. I know that I can't make my life better by staying here, and I need to get out as soon as possible. But the problem is, I don't have the means to do it on my own.\nI'm reaching out to all of you today because I need your help. I know that there are people out there who are kind-hearted and compassionate, and who understand the struggles that come with being different. If you're reading this, and you can relate to my story, then I urge you to help me in any way that you can.\nI don't have anyone to turn to for support, and it's a scary and overwhelming feeling. But even if you can't help me financially, I would be eternally grateful if you could share my story with your friends and family. Maybe there's someone out there who can offer me a helping hand, or who can simply offer me some words of encouragement.\nI don't want to give up on my dreams, and I don't want to resign myself to a life of misery and intolerance. I believe that there is a better life waiting for me somewhere out there, and I just need a little bit of help to find it.\nThank you for taking the time to read my story, and for any support or kindness that you can offer",

        "text": "Life frequently pulls you in multiple ways at once, which can trigger stress. You may think about how to finish a project for work, what to make for dinner, or when to pick up the kids, all at the same time. This stress can cause your emotions to overwhelm you, overburden your thinking, and cause you to react negatively or simply shut down. It’s critical to stand back in these stressful situations and consider how you got here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough stress is a natural response of your body to any demand or threat, prolonged stress without a break in between pressures can harm your physical and mental health. Fortunately, it's possible to stop stress in its tracks. The goal is to recognize your stress triggers and implement effective coping mechanisms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, how can you identify the sources of your stress? While you're in the thick of it, how do you become conscious of what drains you, hinders your productivity, and harms your health? Stop, remain still, and direct your focus to your breathing and the feelings throughout your body. Then, return to the present moment. You may overcome life's obstacles by establishing a separation between the egoic mind and your conscious reaction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;It’s not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it. \\~ Hans Selye\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Is Stress?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you’re under stress, your body releases adrenaline and cortisol in reaction to a threat or significant difficulty. Everyone reacts to stress in different ways, but in most cases, your fight-or-flight response raises your heart rate. People get anxious about themselves, their environment, and the course of action they should follow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery area of your life might cause stress. There’s always a chance of experiencing stress at any time. Therefore, it's crucial to have effective stress management skills. It's a typical, everyday occurrence that everyone encounters. So rather than allowing it to rule your life, why not learn how to confront it head-on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Stress is an ignorant state. It believes that everything is an emergency. \\~ Natalie Goldberg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What Are Stress Triggers?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough it may feel like stress might strike out of the blue, your stress triggers are intentional. They’re made to protect your body from many dangers. However, they do more than merely keep you safe. Any form of trigger reveals the difficulties you experience, the things that are important to you, and how your way of life affects your wellness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey offer a glimpse into your true authentic self rather than merely what you portray to the outside world as you wear your masks and armor. Knowing what stresses you enables you to become more self-aware and reveals what you must do to lead a healthy life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause there are various types of stress, including acute and chronic stress, stress triggers are found everywhere. It's important to emphasize the distinction between good and negative stress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEustress is a type of healthy stress that helps you experience excitement and anticipation. Athletes experience it before a game, much as you do before beginning your ideal job or moving into a new residence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough it may seem like you must avoid stressors at all times, life doesn't have to be shocking or overwhelming. Understanding your stress reactions enables you to create coping mechanisms to manage them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive one. \\~ Hans Selye\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Three Types Of Stress Triggers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt’s frightening to realize that stress can have a variety of sources. But it might be useful to recognize each stressor and comprehend its causes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health identified three stressors that can lead to either short-term or long-term stress. Think about your level of tension and whether any of the following situations apply to you:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Routine stress: These events serve as triggers since they occur regularly. Things like severe workloads bring routine stress as well as, dealing with your children, or household chores.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.\tDisruptive change: Although changes are a constant part of life, occasionally they raise stress levels. These triggers may appear after a move, a job change, or the birth of a child. This could be brought on by anything that alters how you typically conduct your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.\tExtreme trauma, such as being involved in an accident, suffering violent abuse, or having to deal with the death of a loved one, causes these triggers. It's challenging to learn how to manage PTS triggers, which is why it's crucial to have social support or take part in support groups.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFind an individual who can assist you in identifying your stressors and developing coping mechanisms. A coach, like me, can help you as you develop your self-awareness and identify the aspects of your life that are stressing you out the most.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If you want to conquer the anxiety of life, live in the moment, live in the breath. \\~ Amit Ray\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Understanding Your Stress Triggers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you don't know what's generating your stress, it's difficult to manage it. Finding the source of your stress is the first step in managing it. Once you know what your stress triggers are, you can be proactive to avoid them or develop a coping mechanism for when stress overwhelms you. Most people's main stressors include:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Health: The stress that comes with a disease can make chronic health conditions or a serious diagnosis (whether it's you or a loved one) much worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.\tMoney: For many, major sources of stress include unpaid bills, medical debt, worries about the economy, and worries about supporting your family and living comfortably.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.\tFamily: You may be the primary caretaker for an elderly family member or you may juggle work-from-home obligations with parenting young children. Regardless of your family's circumstances, taking care of others can be a significant cause of stress, particularly when routines and support systems have been thrown off. Daily obligations appear to multiply as self-care is neglected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.\tRelationship problems: While many people believe important, stressful decisions like where to raise your family or what values you want to instill in your children cause relationship stress. Many times it's the little things that cause the most stress with another, such as who's doing the laundry, who forgot to take out the trash, and who's next on diaper duty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.\tWork: For many people, their jobs are a significant source of stress. Unrealistic deadlines or demands can bring workplace stress, a never-ending to-do list, a demanding supervisor, or drama-filled coworkers. Additionally, modern technology keeps us constantly connected to our jobs, which is a method to guarantee high levels of stress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6.\tImportant life changes a significant birthday, a divorce, the passing of a loved one, being pregnant, or a move. Big life transitions can be extremely stressful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry journaling for a week if you're unsure of what stresses you out. You can determine when you were most stressed and the circumstances of it by looking back on the entire week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another. \\~  William James\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Healthy Coping Techniques\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is the most effective method for doing this for you? Consider a time in your past when you were carefree and stress-free: your childhood. What pastimes or interests did you enjoy? Perhaps you adored swimming and would spend all of your free time in the pool. Perhaps you were coloring, dancing, riding your bike, or playing with Legos. A good sign of how you should manage stress is your former interests. Those pastimes are the ones that naturally make you happy, free from social obligations or the demands of your never-ending to-do list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStress is a regrettable feature of life. The good news is that there are many techniques to reduce stress. The trick is figuring out how you can ease your stress most effectively. Here are ten coping techniques to reduce the stress in your life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Meditate. Stress can be successfully treated with meditation. It helps rid your mind of stressful ideas and fosters a serene state of mind that persists long after a meditation session. It can also be done anywhere, anytime. Better still? It only requires five minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.\tBreathe. The act of breathing itself may be a very instructive tool for understanding how you respond to an unpleasant situation and can also serve as a technique for overcoming it. When faced with a choice, focusing on your breath might help you come to a wiser and more healthy conclusion. The next time life makes you uncomfortable, pause and pay attention to your breathing. Give your mind some time to relax by taking a few deep breaths for a few seconds or minutes. You'll be able to manage the situation coolly as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Sometimes the most important thing in a whole day is the rest we take between two deep breaths.  \\~ Etty Hillesum\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.\tMove. Your body communicates with you about your health. Your physical tightness may be a sign of how tightly you hold your emotions. Tightening your muscles in challenging circumstances can cause pain or soreness. Stress-related muscle and joint tension and strain can be reduced by moving and stretching throughout the day. It's crucial to keep in mind to get up and move; pause for a bit to stretch or take a stroll. Exercise lowers levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, and releases potent endorphins into the brain, which improve mood, promote relaxation, and serve as natural painkillers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.\tCreate. A great way to decompress is through the arts. Any form of creative expression, including painting, knitting, carpentry, coloring, sculpture, and photography, can lower stress. In fact, studies have shown that after 45 minutes of creative engagement, people's cortisol levels are significantly lower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When we commit to action, to actually doing something rather than feeling trapped by events, the stress in our life becomes manageable. \\~ Greg Anderson\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.\tConnect. Call a buddy or be of service to someone. Humans are social beings with a built-in need to interact with others. An excellent method to relieve stress is to get together with a friend, join a virtual group, or lend a hand to a neighbor. It increases the oxytocin hormone through social interaction, which also lowers anxiety and may help you handle stressful situations better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6.\tNature. Spend some time outside. Studies have shown immersing yourself in nature provides a variety of health advantages, including lowering blood pressure, reducing anxiety, and elevating mood. The good news is that spending just two hours outside each week can significantly improve your mental health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts and to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers. \\~ Fred Rogers\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7.\tImagine. You can get away from your troubles and daily anxieties by losing yourself in a good book or a favorite playlist. Creative escapism in this way diverts the intellect and activates the imagination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8.\tReframe. Brains can be retrained to stop damaging stress reactions. Try using the following phrases aloud while feeling worried or look for more specific ones to use.\n\n•\tIt's not personal.\n\n•\tI don't have to be perfect.\n\n•\tI don't have to have all the answers.\n\n•\tI can handle this—one step at a time.\n\nStress reactions can be beneficial—they’re alerts to pay attention to something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;For fast-acting relief try slowing down.  \\~ Lily Tomlin\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9.\tProblem-solve. Become solution-focused. Making excuses for oneself or complaining doesn't help much. The time to act is now. Understand that the issue and your response to it are different things. Prepare some suggestions for a resolution to the stressful issue or give some wise counsel to yourself as if you were another person. It may be possible to facilitate the flow of solutions by removing oneself just a bit from the problem.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10.\tForgive. Reduce self-blame and forgive your missteps. Everyone errs and harbors regrets. Simply move forward, pay attention to the solutions, and take pride in being proactive. It's never too late to make a difference. Use personal declarations spoken aloud to combat the propensity for self-criticism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Stress is the trash of modern life–we all generate it, but if you don’t dispose of it properly, it will pile up and overtake your life. \\~ Danzae Pace\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Moving Forward\n\nDiscovering what causes you to feel stressed and anxious can help you learn to stop those feelings from taking control of your emotions, thoughts, and well-being. You will also gain the ability to return to the present moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that you can specify your stress triggers you can start to recognize the types that affect you the most.  With recognition comes the ability to implement tactics and strategies to help overcome the tension that you encounter during your day so that you can learn to prevent stress before it occurs. Thus you can learn to love the life you have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Stress is caused by being ‘here’ but wanting to be ‘there.’ \\~ Eckhart Tolle",

I literally feel like eating all the time. I just want to keep eating something even if it's not something I want to eat. Sometimes I keep eating till I physically can't eat more. This has caused me stomach problems too. \nAnd the same way, I keep daydreaming. I never stop. \nI'm in such an important phase of my career and I need to study hard rn. I have become one of the worst students because of this and I still can't improve. My teachers are tired of me but they don't know I myself am desperately trying to improve myself but I am just not able to. \n\n\n\n\nI think may need therapy. But that's just not the option for me.

To go without it, is to lose *tremendous* amounts of benefits.\n\n Going for walks is allowing yourself to rest and recover - mentally, emotionally, physically. It declutters and organizes your mind, processes emotions, is enormously healthy, and... the benefits are endless (improves sleep, motivation, productivity, well-being, eye-sight, sense of purpose, etc....)\n\n *How* can you do it?\n\n Don't distract yourself (no music, no phone, etc.), and go into nature if you can (alternatively a quiet, calm area).\n\n The more and the longer, the better. Start as small as you need. Maybe it's 5 minutes in the morning, or 5 in the evening - that's great! Gradually build your way up.\n\n Try it out, it will be worth it!",

Essentially, what I'm having a hard time with is the bad habits I have that affect my sleep schedule and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to fix them so they don't affect my sleep schedule as much #1 This is gonna sound so funny to a lot of people but the truth is, I struggle a lot with being disciplined enough to go to bed when I'm supposed to, I'm literally a child lol. Either I wanna watch another episode, keep playing on my phone, daydream and overthink instead of falling asleep or find some other excuse to not go to bed, it's often one of the reasons why I can't stick to my sleep schedule. #2 Like every other human being, I sometimes don't wanna wake up in the morning, I just want to keep snoozing my alarm because I'm to tired #3 Sometimes, it's not that I can't wake up, it's that I just don't wanna get out of bed, it's more of a mental thing. I just have no motivation whatsoever and It feels so difficult emotionally and mentally to get out of bed #4 Somewhat related to number 3 I can actually lay in bed all day and do nothing either because I'm to tired or I just don't feel like doing anything else. Once again that screws with my sleep schedule because I won't be tired at night. \n\nI really hope someone out there could give me some good advice. The shitty thing about having narcolepsy is that as soon as I don't follow my sleep schedule (either because I didn't wanna go to sleep or I wanted to sleep in) it can really screw things up, it'll spiral into a 18h sleep then it's even harder to get back on track, anyhow, that's why I need advice so I can follow my sleep schedule more carefully.",

I decided to attend CC because my parents sat me down and told me that my plans to move up north for college weren't gonna happen since they didn't know if they were gonna be able to pay for it even after FAFSA. I was extremely upset but put on at grown up face for them at 17 and said it was okay. I had been working since highschool and I felt like such a failure financially. \n\nSo far roughly 2 years in, I hate it. My hs bf went across the country for uni, all my friends have their dorms and college experiences, while im stuck at community working in hopes of moving out soon to live at my university. the commute is so bad and its hard to roll out of bed and drive to school after overnight shifts. \n\nMy dad asked for a simple $100 a month for rent and for me to pay my own gas money since I was using their cars. This was roughly 400$ a month and I was getting paid $15 at target. I also started working 5am shifts to accommodate for the nights I spent studying for calculus, physics and cs. that felt horrible and I quit my job. I wanted to focus on my school just like everyone else was. But this was difficult as my older sister (who graduated with a bachelors in Spanish) worked retail too and worked more hours than me. I wanted my parents to understand that my stem classes were extremely hard and nothing to compare, but they expected me to have a job and be more like her.\n\nI also ended up getting a used car (super nasty car for $3000). Changed the battery and headlights myself but my dad paid for the car cash on the spot and told me to pay him back. I wanted to say no but I needed a car that spent less gas, and so they'd stop throwing it in my face. I currently owe my dad 2,000. \n\nAnyway, I got a new job where Im getting paid $16 an hour, and well it sucks. They REQUIRE me to work overnight at ulta and if I complain, they give me crap. So I haven't complained... but its not fair because the afternoon people get paid the same and do..less. \n\nI want to quit this job, I want to just finish school because it is sooooo hard. I love it but coming home to my immature older sister FaceTiming all day, sharing a room with my high school sister, and hearing my brother blast his PS4 is not a place I want to come study. I wanted to be surrounded by college students. Not Hispanic parents who think multivariable calc can be done In 20 minutes. \n\nI dont know if im exxaggerating, or not working hard enough. I just feel burnt out. no other jobs take me on the weekends and weeknights except retail. And I owe may dad money which makes this worse. No one at school in my major talks to me because im a girl in male dominated classes, and at home no one understands anything I go through at school. I can't to this anymore.",

        "text": "&gt; TLDR \"The key to overcoming the seemingly absurd struggles we face is by first understanding them, acknowledging their impact on our lives and then focusing on finding meaning within them. By doing so, we can find a sense of purpose and direction in the midst of our challenges.\" \n\nMany are experiencing burn out during this trying time. Here are some common causes.\n\n1. *Feeling of No Control*\nWhen an individual perceives their job as having no meaning and their efforts don't make an impact, they may feel demotivated and lose their sense of purpose, ultimately leading to feelings of helplessness and frustration that can contribute to burnout.\n\n2. *Boredom*\nHaving a job that is below one's skill level, or one that is repetitive with no room for personal growth, can contribute to burnout. Boredom is a significant factor that can make an individual feel disengaged and unmotivated, leading to feelings of being stuck in one place.\n\n3.*Mismatch of Expectations*\nWhen an individual's expectations don't align with the reality or rewards of their job, it can lead to feelings of frustration and demotivation.\n\n\n\n**Who is Sisyphus and why is he related to modern day burnout?**\n\nSisyphus was a character from Greek mythology who was punished by the gods for his deceitfulness and cunning. As his punishment, he was condemned to roll a large boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back down again, repeating this process for eternity.\n\n\nOne similarity between Sisyphus and modern-day man is the feeling of being trapped in a never-ending cycle of work and struggle. Many people today feel like they are constantly pushing a boulder uphill, working hard to achieve their goals and overcome obstacles, only to be reminded that their efforts were futile and meaningless in the grand scheme of things. This can create a sense of frustration and despair, ultimately leading to burnout.\n\n\n**The Perfect Antidote **\nYet there is a big twist that turns Sisyphus into the perfect antidote for our burnout problem. Before his punishment, Sisyphus tricked the god of death, Thanatos, and even managed to cheat the god of the underworld, Hades, on two occasions. We may not know how Sisyphus endures his punishment in the underworld, but his cunning nature suggests that he would certainly attempt to &lt;strong&gt;manipulate the situation to his advantage&lt;/strong&gt;. French philosopher Albert Camus argues that despite the futility of his daily effort and the eternal struggle, Sisyphus is ultimately happy.\n\nFirst and foremost, Sisyphus had a deep understanding of the ultimate purpose of his punishment. He realized that Zeus had devised a game that aimed to generate daily boredom, frustration, and ultimately eternal hopelessness. Sisyphus came to understand that he could win the game by making it his daily goal to avoid experiencing negative emotions. According to Camus, Sisyphus was able to transcend his punishment by fully accepting the futility of his task and realizing that the struggle itself was where he could find happiness and meaning.\n\nSisyphus may have introduced self-imposed challenges to make the task of pushing the boulder up the hill more interesting and engaging. Perhaps he tried using only one hand or attempted to do the task blindfolded. Alternatively, he may have pretended he was competing in a race to push the boulder in fewer steps against his previous attempts, turning the boring task into a personal growth game. By introducing these creative challenges, Sisyphus likely found new ways to stimulate his mind and inject excitement into an otherwise hopeless situation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nUltimately, Sisyphus's story remains relevant today as a symbol of resilience, creativity, and self-awareness.
