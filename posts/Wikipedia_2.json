She *was* born in Canada....has done a lot of work in the US. To my mind, that does NOT make her a \"Canadian-American\"....any more than Elvis would be an American-Canadian if he'd registered to get Canadian citizenship papers to make it more convenient to live in his chalet in the Rockies for several months of the year.\n\nThe \"reason\" posted on Joni's \"talk\" page for my edit having been \"reverted\" is that \"consensus is that people with dual citizenship have both mentioned.\n\nYes, that's fine, but the top line on Angelina Jolie's page does not say she's an American - Cambodian actress. Nor does Sandra Bullock's page say she's an American - German actress. Both of these actresses DO have dual citizenship with the respectively named countries. Arnold Schwarzenegger's page, interestingly, says he's \"an American **and** Austrian actor\".\n\nSo, clearly there IS no consensus on how to identify and notate celebrities' dual citizenship.\n\nIs there not an argument to be made that a person's country of birth/origin is the defining \"characteristic\" of who they \"are\". Is maybe \"Canadian-born, living in the US\" a possible middle ground?\n\nSo the how to identify people's ....identity....is my one question.\n\nThe other is: does anyone think a THREE YEAR BLOCK from editing is a bit severe?",
