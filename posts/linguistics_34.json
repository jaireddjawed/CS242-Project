Wikipedia is all I have when it comes to learning about this topic so bear with me.\n\nI have run into a severe complication in trying to learn about the main branches of the linguistics tree (macro-family, or super-family). The information I have found is conflicting and it seems scholars do not agree with one another on these \"Macro-family\" main branches. Such as how many there are, what they are called, what languages are grouped with in them, ect...  \n\nA lot of macro-families listed seem to not only conflict with one-another but try and group one another within them. \n\nFor example, when reading the  \"Macrofamily\" page (first link), it lists examples such as the Nostratic hypothesis and the Eurasiatic hypothesis. However, the Nostratic hypothesis Wikipedia page(2nd link) has a diagram that pictures Eurasiatic  grouped under Nostratic. \n\nThis is confusing, no to mention that each of the hypothesis Wikipedia pages say controversial on each one.\n\nAll I would like to know is what the main branches are and what languages are grouped within them.\n\nI appreciate any help with this.",

While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

However, I have been asked by a centenarian at our local Esperanto club who is multilingual and loves to discuss grammar if I would put an article of his online, which I did, here: [The Three Participles in English](http://www.esperanto.com.au/the-three-participles-in-english/). \n\nIs what he’s saying controversial? He’s quite passionate about his views and there are some things in the past where he has claimed that linguists think something other than what he’s saying but when we’ve looked online that’s not the case. Though here I notice he’s saying that English has three participles and Wikipedia claims two. I suspect he’s using this concept to try and support one of his ideas about Esperanto which I’m still not sure if I like or not, so it would be great to hear what some other people think so I can get a rounded view.\n\nThanks!",

(e.g. app vs. eBook vs. something else....) \n\nFor the past 10 years, I've been working on a comprehensive \"textbook\" that will take someone from zero to C2 in the [Circassian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_languages). \n\nI have all of the content about 99% done, and I say \"textbook\" in quotes for a few reasons:\n\n1) Have a bunch of audio \"listen and repeat\" files that are independent of any written text\n\n2) When I started, textbooks were still in use; these days, books are morphing (rapidly) into a variety of platforms (e.g. apps, eBooks, etc....)\n\nSo my question here is: Forgetting the language for a moment, if you were to design the ultimate, robust learning resource, what would it look like?\n\nI think that apps like Duolingo, Babbel, etc... have their place, but they are ultimately a bit limiting. Additionally, those apps are designed from a commercial perspective, and kind of tap out at an A2 level. They don't do much with active recall, speaking skills, grammar, etc....\n\nOn the other hand, more traditional textbooks are not as portable as an app, and while they often include lots of drills, those drills require a table to sit at, a pad of paper and a pen, etc....\n\neBooks are much more portable, but their formatting is a bit limiting, and lots of good language resources provide tables to make language easier to digest. \n\nMy dilemma is that I have all the content I need to produce a comprehensive course that can take someone to a level of near fluency.... I need some help thinking through the best way to package it. \n\nSince I'm sure 99.99% of people here do not speak Circassian, the best way I can frame my question would be: **If you were to design the best, most comprehensive language learning resource, what would it look like?** \n\nThanks, in advance.

However, some of his words are true and I wonder if he's right on the first affirmation. \n\nPersonally, I think he isn't. \n\nBefore anything else is imperative to know what languages are. According to my dictionary, is:\n\n1 - A representational system constituted of words and the rules that act over them. Is used by a linguistic community as a means of communication.\n\n2 - An abstract system of interrelated signs of social and psychic nature that is required for all the members of a linguistic community.\n\nAs we can see, no physicalities are mentioned, leading one to conclude that languages occur in a purely mental plane. \n\nNow back to sound, when we put our voice box to use, no one can argue that the result is something physical, but isn't necessarily the sound of a language, the existence of a phoneme proves just that. Just as a reminder, phoneme is the abstract class to wich physical sounds belong to.

        "text": "TL:DR; below.\n\nSince I’m writing a Proto-Germanic grammatical overview, I’ve been looking at Proto-Germanic paradigms often, and how they changed. But there are two things I’m curious at. \n\n**Nominal duals** seem to have disappeared in Proto-Germanic, during the middle phase of Late Proto-Germanic. There do not seem to be resources at their inflection paradigms, nor their history on their disappearance and origin. Donald Ringe discusses the disappearance shortly in Part 1 of his *From PIE to English* series, but I’ve not found that satisfactory. So, what were they inflected as, before they disappeared? \n\nThe second thing is **preterite-present verbs**: verbs where their present forms resemble the past of strong verbs, in look and form. These existed as a small class in Proto-Germanic, but seem to have virtually disappeared in English, though verbs that once were preterite-present, exist as weak verbs nowadays. Do any verbs exist in modern English, that could be called preterite-present (if, even, disregarding their origin?). So yes, which ones? And if no, do they exist in other Germanic languages?\n\n**TL:DR;** writing grammatical overview for Proto-Germanic. Where are paradigms of the PGmc noun dual inflections, and do preterite-present verbs exist in modern English?",

I would be able to explain this difference by the difference of technical terms and names of plants, or the difference in the timing it changed(the *fuinki*'s change occured in the 20th century, while the *sazanka*'s change occured in the 18th century).\n\nAnd then I have a question.

But linguistics is not my main field, so at this point I doubt that I could devote the time to reading more than a single monograph on the subject. \n\nSo with that in mind, what are your recommendations here? Right now, I was thinking about one of the following three works:\n\nGoldberg, *Constructions: A Construction Grammar Approach to Argument Structure*\n\nGoldberg, *constructions at Work: The Nature of Generalization in Language*\n\nOr\n\nCroft, *Radical Construction Grammar: Syntactic Theory in Typological Perspective*\n\nThe first Goldberg seems to be what I see cited most often, so I assume that's the classic text.
