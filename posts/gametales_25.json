        "text": "Hello again! This is a continuation of 'What we are in the Shadows Part 7 (Tank Busters)', which you can find here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4achgr/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_7_tank/. Last time, our increasingly competent runners-in-training were tasked with the theft of a sedan. Seemingly simple, this task was complicated by the presence of an actual professional: The cybernetically enhanced mercenary known as Tank. Though the team devised a solid plan, their target saw through the ruse and easily dispatched Poindexter. In a surprise move, Tank propelled himself over a guard rail and into the abyss below. With a wounded comrade in hand, the team returned to their barn shelter and discovered that Poindexter had been infected with nanites. With his fate uncertain, his friends had little to do but wait and hope. This is where we find ourselves as of now.\n\n\"Fucking fuck!\" Hautangi snarled furiously as he paced through the barn. \"Nanites!? What the fuck are nanites!? Why the fuck would someone want to inject Fatty with nanites? What the fuck is going on!?\" Nellie rolled her eyes and glared disdainfully at him. Her tone was reminiscent of a school-teacher explaining something to the special education student.\n\n\"Nanites are veeeeeery small machines that work on a cellular level. Someone obviously paid Tank to use a delivery method for nanites and Poindexter was the unfortunate victim. We don't know what's going on and you need to expand your fucking vocabulary!\" In the past, her uncharacteristic outbursts had cowed the large Maori into a stunned silence; not so today.\n\n\"Well whoop-di-fucking-do for you, little miss rich! How about you put that big brain to work and figure out what's happening to Ben!\" Hautangi roared back at her, his large frame looming over the petite woman. She was not deterred, jamming a finger angrily into his chest.\n\n\"Why don't you sit down and shut up, you ignorant thug! Just because I happen to know more than you does NOT mean I know everything!\" Nellie hissed through clenched teeth, her eyes blazing. Hautangi raised a tightly clenched fist, uncertain himself if he meant to strike her or gesture emphatically, when Leilani spoke up. \n\n\"That's enough from both of you.\" Her voice was deceptively quiet, a barely contained fury simmering beneath the surface. \"Getting angry won't help Ben and it won't help us. You heard the doctor: He either lives or he dies. We'll make him comfortable however we can but there is nothing we can do to make this right.\" There was a darkness to the veterinarian that chilled the bickering duo into silence. \"We can't afford to lose our shit now. We're a person down and we can't afford to lose anyone else, so get your shit in line.\" It was a strange thing, an authoritative growl, but it worked: Nellie sighed and crossed her arms helplessly while Hautangi stalked to his bed. Having efficiently defused the situation, Leilani took a deep breath to compose herself before speaking again. \"For now, we do what we normally would: Keep training and keep learning.\" Her gaze passed between her two conscious team-mates, still  hard as steel and cold as ice. \"No more bickering over shit we can't change. Am I clear?\" Nellie grudgingly nodded her consent and, after a hard glare from Leilani, so did Hautangi.\n\nThe next few days were tense. Though the team continued with their exercises and studies, they lacked their typical drive. Hautangi took no pleasure in beating the girls in sparring and Nellie was sullen throughout her demolitions training. Their days were broken up by checking on Poindexter and switching out the wet clothes on his forehead. The cab driver had lost some of his flab, the nanites wreaking havoc on his body, and developed a nasty fever. His veins no longer shone with an amber glow but it was obvious that there was something very wrong with Benjamin. After almost a week had passed, the others had given up hope that he would ever recover. It was a pleasant surprise when they found him groggily chewing on a soy-pack one morning. Poindexter's disused voice rasped when he spoke to them, squinting against the fluorescent lights.\n\n\"Hey guys. What's up?\" The trio stared in stunned silence before Nellie began to laugh. It was a slow build-up, beginning as a quiet giggle before quickly exploding into hysterical cackling. The others were not far behind, Leilani's chuckling and Hautangi's braying mirth joining her before long. Poindexter watched on blankly, still sucking at the soy-pack in his mouth. After the tittering trio had finally calmed down, the chubby man coughed and rubbed at his throat. He stood slowly and walked back to his bed, calling out over his shoulder. \"Yeah, no. I'm not awake enough for whatever you nut-jobs are doing.\" Leilani followed him quickly, doing a quick check-over as they walked. Finding absolutely nothing wrong with him, she grinned and slapped him across the head. \"Ow, what the fuck!?\" Poindexter pouted, hurt at her actions. Leilani shoved him back on the bed and threw a blanket over him. \n\n\"Just get some rest, dumb-ass. You've missed out on a lot of training and I'm gonna make sure that you catch up.\" The vet's words instilled a sense of dread in her friend but he smiled weakly at her. Quickly closing his eyes, Benjamin slipped into sleep...or pretended too. Happy to have their fat coward back, the others celebrated quietly. Morning came quickly and everyone forced Poindexter back to work with gleeful vigor. Another week passed before Ghost reappeared but the team barely noticed the time fly. Gathered around the table with a beverage in their hands, everyone enjoyed a brief reprieve from everything. Ghost let himself participate for a moment before speaking.\n\n\"Alright, alright. Put a lid on it. Poindexter, good to see that you're back on your feet.\" The man in question grinned and raised his beer to their mentor. \"Right, we all know that I only show up for one reason so let's get to it.\" Ghost produced a data chip from his coat with a flourish and plugged it into the trideo projector. \"Last time, you had to steal a car. This time? You're looking for a flower.\" The entire group groaned at his statement. Leilani voiced their collective thoughts with loathing in her voice. \n\n\"A flower? What the fuck, Ghost?\" The mercenary waggled a finger at them, somehow holding his beer with the same hand.\n\n\"Now hold on. You're stealing a flower that blooms on a single night once a year, from a heavily guarded coastal facility for a double A corporation.\" The room was so silent that you could have easily heard the sound of a pin dropping. Ghost's smile grew as he enjoyed their response. \"See? Not so easy now, is it? By the way, the flower's in a blowhole.\" Their instructor leaned back on his stool, taking a long drag from his beer. \"So, who gets to go climbing?\" \n\nTwo weeks later, Ryan Pattilo was bemoaning the hardships of guard duty. Sure, the pay was great and it came with a long list of fringe benefits but nights like tonight were boring as hell. It was quite evening at Spitwater's Punakaiki headquarters. Other than the constant status reports filtering through on the security channel, no conversation was permitted. Any unauthorised trix activity was right out because the site Spyder was constantly monitoring the feeds. With a partner, this might not be so bad but tonight was solo patrol for Ryan and he was already bored out of his mind. The security agent had been marching through the lower caverns for the last hour, doing security sweeps through the shadowy corridors. The only thing that this outpost had going for it was the view. Ryan smiled under his helmet, scratching his chin.\n\n\"Yeah, it's gorgeous alright.\" Murmuring to himself, the guard stood at the precipice of a stony outcropping, one of many along the caverns. Before him, a vast expanse of shimmering water roared against the coast. By the light of a full moon, it was simply breath-taking. Ryan chuckled to himself before setting his rifle to the side. \"Might as well strain the old bladder out.\" Unzipping, he began to relieve himself over the edge. Five feet beneath him, clutching to the rocky walls of the cavern, Nellie gritted her teeth and tried desperately to ignore the stray drops of warm liquid that flecked her hair. She waited patiently for the flow to slow and then stop, accounting for shake-time and reshuffling of precious equipment. Thirty seconds later, the fledgling shadowrunner continued her ascent along the blowhole wall. Clad in dark clothing and wrapped in climbing gear, Nellie proved a remarkably adept infiltrator. Hauling herself up with small hand-holds, it took some few minutes to reach the mouth. Here, she waited for the next phase of the plan.\n\n\"This is a terrible idea.\" Poindexter whispered to Hautangi. The two of them were slowly crawling along the perimeter fence, shuffling awkwardly through the dense foliage with their weapons. They had only just managed to slip through the perimeter, the bulky men unsuited for this kind of work. Even worse, the pair wore thick ballistic vests filled with ammuntion. Thankfully, the next stage of their brilliant scheme required little in the way of stealth. \n\n\"Shut up. I need to concentrate, you fucking idiot.\" Hautangi growled at his partner in crime before focusing. The courtyard before them was large, protected by razor-wire fencing with an outbuilding situated in the center. Large spotlights scanned the perimeter thoroughly and had almost caught the hapless idiots more than once. Only dumb luck and sheer determination had brought them this far. Now that they were here, they have the hardest job of all: Surviving. Hautangi turned his attention inwards and grasped the power crackling there. With a grunt of effort, the Mystic Adept forced his magic outwards in an electrifying display of arcane strength. The electro-magnetic pulse ripped through the electronics in the courtyard, frying the searchlights and temporarily killing the vehicles moving through. The spell took a toll on his body as Hautangi winced in pain, fatigue already settling in on his huge frame. \n\n\"My turn now, right? Shit. Okay, wish me luck.\" Ben laughed nervously before shifting up onto his feet and running for the outbuilding. His first obstruction was a guard, the surprised woman turning to face him.\n\n\"Halt! This is private...\" Was all she managed to get out before Poindexter nailed her in the chest with a taser round. The security contractor hit the ground with a thud as her body began spasming wildly. Her partner whipped around, bringing his weapon to bear when he suffered the same fate. Their attacker ran past them, apologizing as he did.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, I hope that didn't hurt too much.\" Chaos was erupting now as the on-site Spyder began relaying that two of their number were down. While the communication network had suffered a momentary set-back, it had already been handled by the professional Matrix-monkey. Automatic weapons fire began to roar through the otherwise empty building as Poindexter dove for cover. Screeching loudly, the taxi-driver curled in on himself and prayed that none of the rounds would punch through him! From his vantage point, Hautangi watched as half a dozen guards opened fire on the outbuilding. Knowing that he would have to choose his moment carefully, the con-man started crawling back along the perimeter; the act far easier with the searchlights out of commission. \n\nBack at the blowhole, Nellie sighed in relief when the gunfire erupted in the night. Her arms were already shaking from the exertion of remaining where she was, so she was glad when the signal came. Hauling herself over the edge, Nellie rolled onto her feet and started running. Any defender's in her area were quickly making their way towards the distraction so the nimble runner moved with impunity. The only problem that she might face was the Spyder catching her on the cameras. Thankfully, that was being taken care of. Nellie slid to a stop at the edge of a massive blowhole. Water rushed up the tunnel in a colossal spray but it barely managed to reach half-way before abating. The golden flower was three quarters of the way down this blowhole, a dangerous climb at the best of circumstances. This? This was not the best of circumstances.  The climber sighed explosively before beginning her trip down. \n\nOn the other side of the facility, Poindexter emptied the first magazine in his pistol. The rounds ripped through flimsy plastic easily enough but not a single one hit the intended target. He was a rotten shot, it was true. Thankfully, Ben's task was to keep their attention and her fulfilled that admirably. There was a lull in the cacophony after his last 'attack' until a voice rang out over a megaphone. \n\n\"Throw your weapon out the door and surrender with your hands up. We have your surrounded. You cannot win this!\" A moment passed after the man in charge spoke and the security forces waited expectantly. The attacker was outnumbered and outgunned, so he would have to be insane to keep fighting. This thought passed through their commander's mind right before a shock round nailed him in the forehead. He collapsed in a twitching mass of limbs while Hautangi congratulated himself on a damn fine shot. While the rest of the guards were stunned, Poindexter unloaded another magazine in their general direction. Each of them scrambled into cover, returning fire and calling for reinforcements. Armed agents began pouring in from every direction, each of them contributing to the wall of copper-jacketed rounds ripping through the quickly disappearing structure. \n\n\"Oh shit. Fat man might actually die.\" Hautangi muttered to himself in awe before picking off another two of the guards. In the end, all it really did was draw attention to himself as some of the base personnel began shooting at him. Rolling behind a tree for cover, the big Maori tried to make himself very small. \"She better be fucking done by now.\" He snarled, glad that the gunfire masked his words.\n\nNellie was not, in fact, done. While she had managed to descend the ten meters that was required, extracting the flower was proving quite difficult. It needed to be done with a specifically ordained blade, that Nellie just so happened to possess, and the moonlight must be touching it when it was taken. So she sat in front of the plant and waited irately for the silver orb in the sky. Finally, accompanied by the sounds of a small war, La Luna deigned to share her light with the Golden Lotus that so desperately needed it. Knowing that her window was small, Nellie made to cut the flower from it's perch and be done with it. The deed would have been trifling had the plant not screamed in fear. Nellie recoiled in shock, her mind unable to process that the Golden Lotus had just shrieked, and swung slowly around the blowhole. Everything up until this point had been part of the plan. Vocal flora was not. \n\nIt took almost a full minute for the runner-in-training to comprehend what had just happened. Thought she desperately wished that she could simply play it off as a trick of the wind, Nellie had been through far too much in recent weeks to play the ignorance card. The moonlight was visibly fading from the blowhole as clouds began to shroud the brilliant orb, so she would need to act quickly. Marshaling her resolve, Nellie steadied herself and tried once more. Though the Golden Lotus screamed once more, it's cries were silenced as the ornate blade sliced through the stem like a laser through flesh. Quickly plucking the now-voiceless flower from the wall and gently placing it inside a magnetically sealed case, Nellie congratulated herself on a job well done. It was at that exact moment that Fate decided to intervene: Things had been running all to smoothly. \n\nThe blowhole began to tremble and a great roaring echoed through the tunnel. Nellie looked around frantically before turning her attention below. No-one, she realized belatedly, had checked the weather forecast for the day. This included tidal phenomenon, such as the improbably strong King Tide that was currently active in the area. Nellie put two and two together just as a gargantuan wave of sea water rocketed towards her. Unable to resist the great gout of pressurized water, she was ripped from the rock wall and propelled into the air. Nellie soared up and out of the blowhole within moments, hurtling ten meters through the air. For a time, she flew as gracefully as a bird but reality soon reinstated itself and she crashed painfully into the earth. Pain became her world but the surprisingly tough apprentice runner managed to return to her feet and start hobbling away with the prize. \n\nThe boys were surrounded and hope was lost when the security forces ceased fire. Each of them had received commands from the Spyder to stand down. Apparently, this was all some kind of elaborate preparedness drill that they had all failed by even allowing the examiners to enter the facility. The order was given to return to their posts while their commanding officers met to discuss possible improvements. Hautangi and Poindexter were escorted to the main entrance by contrite security agents and wished a pleasant evening. From her post inside the Spyder's office, Leilani smiled viciously. The Matrix specialist had been so caught up trying to determine the source of the attack that he was completely blindsided by a very angry veterinarian. With his log-in information, she had taken control of the facility and was already wiping any trace of her team out of the system. With one last chuckle, Leilani opened up a few porn tabs for her unconscious victim and left the building as quietly as she had entered. \n\nNellie finally caught up to the rest of the team almost an hour later, the climb down and subsequent hike proving exhausting. By the time she arrived at the rendezvous point, her legs felt like jelly and her heart burned. Despite the pain, there was a triumphant grin plastered across her sweat-stained face. A van was waiting for her and the doors opened as Nellie approached. Hautangi smirked and helped her inside, setting her down next to Chrissie. The hustler sank heavily into his own chair, strapping in with a wry remark.\n\n\"Well, what the hell took you so long?\" His taunt was met with deranged cackling that startled everyone. It stopped as suddenly as it had started as Nellie stared at him. She spoke without breaking eye contact.\n\n\"I got pissed on, screamed at by a flower and thrown twenty meters in the air by a blowhole.\" While her words were not threatening, Nellie managed to convey intimidation towards her colleague. Silence fell over the van before Leilani sighed, muttering bitterly to herself.\n\n\"Why do we always get the weird jobs?\" ",

        "text": "(Or, alternatively: Make Like a Tree and Get Outta Here!)\n\nIt has been awhile since my gaming group was able to get a session in, but yesterday we finally got together again.\n\nWe last left our heroes here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/48f0lv/5e_best_heroes_battling_the_cultists/\n\nThe Best Heroes are:\n\nUlaan - TN Half-Elf Ranger\n\nDirk - CN Half-Orc Barbarian\n\nDeceit - TN? Tiefling Warlock\n\nTrevor - CN? Half-Elf Cleric\n\nForsetti - LN Human Paladin\n\n*****\n\nForsetti's blade came down on Garn's clavicle, the cultist cell leader didn't quite lose his head, but it was abundantly clear that he wasn't going to walk this off.\n\n\"Damn...\" Blood gurgled out of Garn's mouth as he strained to speak. \"Here I was gonna be part of somethin'...  Heh. Heheheh. Guess she was right, though. She had a plan for... for this...\"\n\nGarn used his last ounce of strength to rip open his robe, revealing a circle of runes carved into his chest. Forsetti and Dirk swore they saw it flicker as Garn's blood flowed down over top of the markings. Garn's body spasmed. His jaw wrenched open and out from it emerged... a tree?\n\nYeah. The same kind of tentacly tree thing that this Unformed God used as his sigil. Crap.\n\n\"Hrmmm. Look.\" Ulaan's growl broke the stunned silence. From his position on the platform, he had a better view of the whole room. He gestured his arm in the directions of the other cultist's bodies. The same twisted trees were started to grow from the mouths or chests of them as well. Ulaan looked back at the altar in front of him. Nolan Carver's body was not sprouting a tree. Mary Carver was still unconscious and breathing.\n\n\"Burn the bodies! The sooner, the better!\", Ulaan pulled himself up on top of the altar, just outside of the circle of runes.\n\nTrevor, noticing how rough Dirk was looking ran with all of his speed towards the big guy, preparing a Cure Wounds. \"Dirk, grab my hand!\"\n\nThe strange floating magical orbs continued to circle around the room, but without pattern to their paths. Forsetti stood frozen, trying to take in all that was happening and searching the back of his mind for what this all could mean **[Religion check: Failed]**\n\nDirk reached to meet Trevor's outstretched hand and felt instantly better **[HP: +18 --&gt; 19 HP - definitely feeling much better]**. Reinvigorated, Dirk grabbed a torch and held it Garn's corpse. But, bloodsoaked robes don't exactly make for the best firestarting material.\n\n\"Screw that, this is much quicker!\" Deceit shouted from across the room. She pulled one of the special Alchemist's Fire flasks out of her bag and smashed it on the corpse nearest to her, setting it ablaze, much more efficiently.\n\nAs Ulaan went to cut Mary's restraints, he saw the runes dotting the floor. He really never had much of a head for that magic mumbo-jumbo, especially the stuff that didn't just flow naturally from the world, but his mind flashed back to something: Some time ago, he had been walking across the room in the inn. Deceit was scribbling those damned symbols all over the floor. Whatever. He thought nothing as he continued on his way. Deceit's rage had been sudden and fierce. Something to the effect of \"dimwitted hayseed\" and \"don't disturb my runes!\" and \"ruin everything, cause the whole place to explode!\". That sorta crap. **[Arcana Check: Surprisingly Passed]**\n\n\"Oh, what the heck,\" he thought to himself, and he rubbed one of the symbols out with the heel of his boot. There was a shimmer all around him. The faces in the glowing, translucent tree thing growing down from above Ulaan began to shriek in an entirely different way, and the wretched thing retracted back into the rune circle on the ceiling. \n\n...\n\n\"Huh... no 'boom'. Knew Deceit was full of ömkhii baas on that one.\" Pleased with himself, Ulaan smirked as he cut Mary's restraints with his sword, picked her up, and hopped down from the altar.\n\n\"Dirk, try this!\" Trevor handed Dirk a flask of oil from his pack, then grabbed another flask, this time one of the Alchemist's Fires. He lobbed that one at the body of the cultist by the column. The trees continued to grow at an alarming rate, in spite of the fire that enveloped the bodies. Frustrated, Dirk dropped the torch and ripped at the tree growing out of Garn. He managed to snap a branch off of his. As he did, small tendrils grabbed at his arm. He growled and swatted them away.\n\nForsetti was still searching the back of his mind when crash of Trevor's flask brought him back to the here and now. He looked towards the way out. The two corpses that were in front of the door now had rather sizable trees sprouting from them. Blocking the way. He grabbed his flask of Alchemist's Fire and tossed it at them.\n\nDirk brought his axe down on Garn's neck, cleanly severing his head and the chunk of the tree growing out of it. The force of the blow knocked the corpse over, ripping roots out of the ground in the process. More tendrils sprouted from the neck stump and grabbed at Dirk's axe. He easily ripped it away from them. \"I don't like where this is headin', guys. We need to go!\"\n\nDeceit ran towards the exit. As a Tiefling, she had little to worry about from the flames. As a warlock, she had more to worry about from the tendrils, though. Her leap over the corpse was abruptly interrupted and she smacked hard into the ground. Ulaan, carrying Mary also moved towards the exit, but was slowed by the weight of an extra 1.5 people. Trevor cast an illusion of himself to run across the other corpse and distract the tendrils while he made his exit. He was a little singed from the fire, but otherwise fine.\n\nThe trees continued to grow, though the burning ones were a little slower in that regard, but the fire had mostly been snuffed by the sheer bulk of the things by now. The magical orbs floated around the room, creating an obstacle for the three left in the chamber. Dodging around the orbs, Forsetti plowed through the trees in the doorway. Once he made it to the other side, he turned and helped Deceit to pull herself free. Dirk followed Forsetti and chopped at one of the trees as he made it through. \"C'mon, Stick! Time to go!\"\n\nUlaan forced his way through the rapidly growing branches of the tree, but he couldn't move as freely as he normally could, and found himself in the clutches of the tendrils. \"Hang on! He's got this!\" Trevor patted Dirk on the back, imbuing him with bonus of a Guidance spell. The trees continued to grow, and a small dropped a small mass of something gooey and brown behind Forsetti. Without hesitating, he swung at it, and destroyed it **[Critical Hit]**. \"We really need to get moving, here...\"\n\n\"Don't have to tell me twice!\" Dirk grabbed Mary from Ulaan and started heading up the stairs with her. \n\nDeceit, who was already halfway up the stairs herself, turned, and with a huff, blasted a spell at the tree holding Ulaan. \"Can we hurry it up, down there!?\". \n\nBreaking free from the tree, Ulaan took off running and quickly caught up with the rest of the group. \"Okay, what now?\"\n\n\"We should burn it down! Screw these cultist assholes, man!\"\n\n\"I like that idea, Kid\". Deceit made a fist which began to glow with fiery energy.\n\n\"It will get the guards to come help, too!\" Dirk added.\n\nThe ground rumbled beneath them as the group made it to the top of the stairs and out of the hidden fireplace door. \"Guys, I really don't think we'll need the fire to get their attention. Just keep going!\" Forsetti said as he hit the switch to close the door. Once they were outside of the house, the group took a moment to catch their breath. Trevor took a second to check Mary's condition. \"Guys, she's still breathing! And... I think the parasite inside her's still got a heartbeat!\" Mary suddenly snapped to alertness and realized that the weird Half-Elf kid had his ear to her stomach. She gave him a quick slap across the cheek to get him away. **[Medicine Check: Very Passed]**\n\n\"Mother and child still alive. Good. We managed that mu--\" A loud explosion rocked the area. Rubble came tumbling from the sky. Forsetti was unfortunate enough to be struck, everyone else managed to step out of the way. An absolutely massive tree of screaming faces had erupted from the remains of the house. Clusters of leafy... something dropped from the branches of the sprawling canopy.\n\n\"Guys, I don't think we're out of the woods just yet!\" Everyone flinched a little at Trevor's pun. Trevor let loose a Sacred Flame at the creature closest to him, but missed.\n \nOne of the creatures struck Deceit.\n \nA second hit Ulaan. \n\nA third swatted at Trevor, who just managed to juke out of the way.\n\nA fourth smacked Dirk across the face.\n\nA fifth wrapped its tendrils around Mary, who screamed in terror.\n\nA sixth one, some distance away, reared up and fired some sort of needles at Dirk. The barbarian let out a yowl as the spines stuck in his back.\n\nMore of these things were dropping all over the area that was now covered by the massive crown of the tree, but they did not seem to notice the party.\n\nDeceit ducked and rolled out from the crowd of creatures by the door, and ended up behind the creature attacking Trevor. \nForsetti attempted to heal himself, but the blow to his head left him a little too woozy to really do a great job. **[He rolled, like, a 3 on his Cure Wounds]** \nUlaan drew his short swords, and in the same quick motion, slashed the bush-thing that had struck him, and the one grabbing Mary. Both dropped. \"Not so tough.\"\n\nDirk, seeing an opening, grabbed Mary and ran as swiftly as he could, away from the area they had all been clustered at. As he ran, more of the bush-things dropped around him, he turned his gaze skyward. The flowers on the tree were strange, twisted things, and Dirk noticed brown, slimey fruits starting to form from within the withering petals.\n\nTrevor stabbed his dagger deep into the bush-thing attacking him. He glanced over his shoulder at the unobstructed path away from the fight, and started to move towards that direction. But, he hesitated. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Forsetti and Ulaan fending off the creatures. Forsetti, in particular was struggling, only just managing to get his shield up in time to block another volley of spines from the distant bush-creature, but in doing so, leaving himself open to a hit from the one swatting at him. \"N...aahh... Damn it!\" Trevor rushed towards his allies.\n\n\"Oh, thank the gods!\" Mary exclaimed from Dirk's shoulder. Skeletons, emblazoned with the crest of the city guard rounded the corner from the cross-street Dirk was running towards **[It's explained a little bit in the previous parts, but the city uses reanimated skeletons as a front line for most combat]**. But, with a loud crash, Dirk suddenly found his path blocked. One of the strange fruits had dropped right in front of him. It was a strange shapeless, shifting blob. It looked like it was trying stabilize its form somehow.\n\nDeceit ran towards this new foe, casting Arms of Hadar such that it would only strike this creature. It reeled in response, but quickly resumed shuffling towards the nearest creatures.\n\nMeanwhile, Forsetti managed the energy for an underhand slash, killing one of the bush-things attacking him, but left himself open to the other one. The paladin's shield clunked loudly as he hit the cobblestones. Ulaan quickly dispatched that bush-thing, the last one in the immediate vicinity. He slung Forsetti over his shoulder and started moving away, before more of them could get close.\n\nDirk managed to get close to the skeletons, \"Help! Tree! Fix this!\" he shouted as he ran by. The skeletons looked at Dirk, looked at each other, shrugged and resumed walking.\n\n\"He means kill the tree and its spawn!\" Mary clarified for him. The skeletons looked back at Mary and nodded in relieved agreement at the much less ambiguous and confusing wording.\n\nTrevor reached Ulaan and helped carry Forsetti. Taking a moment to plug the rather nasty wound just under the edge of his collar. \"There, I think that'll keep him from bleeding out, for now.\" **[Medicine check: Passed]**. Ulaan suddenly yelped in pain. There were now several large spines sticking out of his side. \"Uh, I think we need to keep going dude, c'mon.\"\n\nThe blob thing finally seemed to coalesce into a somewhat stable form. A form that was still a blob full of twisted chattering mouths **[The DM really likes his body horror-type stuff, so of course he would drop a Gibbering Mouther on us]**. Deceit and the skeletal guards seemed unaffected by the new, horrible noise assaulting them. They were however thrown off balance as the ground beneath the creature seemed to turn soft and spongy. The unfortunate skeleton closest to it was bitten clean in half. As a final insult, the thing spat acid at Deceit, blinding her.\n\nAn armoured city guard construct rounded the street corner and upon seeing the chaos in front of it, began charging towards the battle. Deceit managed to back away from the blob creature and kept running in the last direction she had a vague idea of being safe. Ulaan and Trevor, seeing that the blob thing separated them from the rest of the group, decided to head east, instead of west. It seemed like a safer option. Dirk gently set Mary down by the safe corner and ran back to grab Deceit's ~~hand and lead her to safety~~ pick her up and bolt out of there because it was easier and quicker. Trevor let Ulaan go ahead while he taunted the myriad of monsters and got ready to do some fancy dodging. The needle-flinging bush creature took aim at Trevor, but he was very much ready to dodge around the spines.\n\nAcross the plaza, the blob thing easily smashed the two skeletons in front of it, then spat more acid at Dirk, Deceit and Mary, but luckily the goo splattered harmlessly on the wall behind them. Deceit regained enough of her sight that she decided to fire a blast at the blob, from atop Dirk's shoulder. It hit, but again, didn't seem to cause a great deal of distress to the monstrous thing.\n\n\"Shit. I don't think we're gonna be able to take much more of this. This is way above our pay grade.\" // \n\n**[[Across the plaza]]** \"You got anything left, Kid?\" \n\n\"Just basic stuff. No heals, no last-minute miracles.\"\n\n\"Figured. Thought I should check, though.\"\n\nBeaten, bloodied, exhausted and at opposite ends of the plaza, there wasn't much more that our group could hope to accomplish here. It was then that a booming voice rang out from around the corner. \"KNEEL BEFORE KORAK THE ALL-SEEING!\"\n\nWell. Fuck.\n\n[[I haven't gone into the full backstory of this campaign in great detail, because I didn't start my recap until several sessions in. Let's back things up a bit here:\n\nGrandia was an otherwise unremarkable city-state until one day, many years ago. A creature, later to be known as the God-King Gabriel appeared in the outskirts of the city and proclaimed himself its new overlord. He backed up this assertion with his powerful magic. He also had in his service, three great and powerful generals. No one is entirely sure how Gabriel has these creatures in his service. I'm not sure what's more worrisome, either they serve him willingly, or he's powerful enough to keep them bound to his will.\n\nThe iconography of Gabriel and his Generals is now heavily reflected throughout the city. Gabriel seems humanoid. One of his generals, known to us only as Bad-Axe, seems vaguely humanoid as well, but decked out in a massive suit of armour and wielding, you guessed it, a massive axe. The second general, I don't know if there's ever been a proper name assigned to him that we use. He's some sort of shadow creature. Would probably only be rumoured to exist, if not for the fact that his Shadow Guard act as a Secret Police type of force within the city, rooting out potential dissidents and rebels, or any sort of problems, really.\n\nThe third and final general is perhaps the most prominent threat that we have seen throughout the city. It is Korak's all-seeing eyes that monitor much of the activity within the city. It is known that all creatures who die within his gaze rise again as undead minions, hence, he personally oversees all executions that occur in the city. This is the source of all of the skeletons employed by the city guard as their shock troopers. This very old, very haggard Beholder has his main eye blinded, and one of his 8 eyes missing from the stalks around his orb-y face. The stump of this missing eye still responds to movement and it is said that he traded that eye in order to raise the dead.\n\nSo, while this Cult of the Unformed God is very much a thorn in our side, they're not likely the source of the BBEG in the campaign. That's Gabriel. And one of his top minions has just swooped in to rescue us. Korak is ultimately on our hit list, but, like, probably when we're in our mid-teens for levels. Not at level 3.]]\n\nKorak begins firing various spells and such at the Mouther. It crumples pretty quickly, then rises again, in thrall to Korak. Korak and his retinue continue towards the tree spawning these creatures, making short work of everything in his way. Our party takes this as the very sensible time to make their exit.\n\n*****\n\nOver the next few days, we recuperate, debrief our friends in the City Guard, receive payment for our services rendered in determining the cause of death of Nolan Carver, as well as the value-added service of saving his wife and unborn child.\n\nAs peace settles again in the city of Grandia, we resume our non-adventuring day-to-day lives. Trevor keeps on pickpocketing in the market squares (narrowly avoiding arrest by hiding out in a ~~sewer~~ STORM DRAIN ...and making friends with another raccoon). Forsetti resumes rubbing elbows with the nobles (resulting in an incident of getting mixed up with the wrong people and ending up in jail for unseemly conduct). Dirk and Ulaan resume hunting and trapping (they fail to save a young man lost in the woods, who was being attacked by a mountain lion, but the boy's family is grateful that they were at least able to return his body to them). Deceit does more research into teleportation magic and artifacts that might be able to provide a way out of this mess.\n\n[[Basically, we didn't do spectacular on making any new contacts this between-adventures time. Better contacts might have led to us progressing the main plot more effectively]].\n\nOne day, Trevor finds a bulletin posted in a market square. It seems a wizard is offering payment in exchange for the slaying of a young red dragon in one of the towns north of Grandia. Looks like the Best Heroes are getting into the Dragon-Slaying Business next session. (https://youtu.be/a5abgDBQHPk)",

        "text": "I'm now a few sessions in on my first game (both as a DM and in general). I have two brand new players, one playing a monk and the other playing a rogue, had another player for the second session, never have any clue how many people to plan for so it's been scalable stuff from the beginning. The monk pays attention and enjoys combat, the rogue doesn't pay attention and enjoys asking unimportant people for their names and thinking about getting himself killed. Up to this point all the unimportant people have been given names then made at least moderately more important later.\n\nStory starts in an army training camp with the monk voluntarily there and the rogue given the option of joining the army instead of hanging (for trying to steal a pocket watch from a noble, which he added to his backstory sometime near the end of the first session). I open with practice fights, we learn to do combat, monk takes maybe five minutes to get through the rest of the day, rogue takes almost half an hour continually looking for ways to try to escape and then talks to an NPC that tells him that the easiest way out is to just go with the flow. Ten minutes of trying to figure out who has a key later we get to round two of practice fights and end the session walking away with the rogue now out of chains, not entirely sure that he is out of chains (he asked right then as well as a couple times between sessions and once at the beginning of the next session).\n\nFor the second session I've prepped a tent with several important people, show the first two the tent before the lord captain of the training camp sends them off to collect six gold, a weight set, and a long wait. Rogue decides that he needs to chat up the guard showing them the way across the camp in addition to sizing up his lack of a purse. One horrible perception roll with nothing to add to it later the party makes it to the quartermaster's tent, gives the quartermaster their writ, and gets a long wait while I bring the new player in. New player is a sorceress who is the long lost older sister of the rogue (played by his younger sister). Briefly introduce her to the important people in the command tent, ask her to wait just a bit, and move back to the main party.\n\nRogue decides to use his long wait to ask the clerk about getting a belt of returning (thanks, critical role, I'd been asked about the damn thing daily since the end of the first session). Clerk tells him no, rogue counters with surely you must know someone, clerk continues to tell him no, rogue's player announces that he's proficient in persuasion, clerk tells him he came in with a note for six gold so there's no way he could afford it even if clerk could procure it. Party leaves with what they came for plus a bonus package courtesy of one of the important people, are escorted back along with more talking to the same guard, and we have the big brother sister reunion in the tent.\n\nThe sorceress announces that she's the rogue's older sister. The rogue, who's now added to his backstory that he doesn't like magic users (the player decided that someone did something to him and he wanted it to be the potential 4th for that session, his sister's friend that couldn't make it), pulls a dagger on her in the middle of the command tent filled with all the important people. After letting the dialogue play out a bit and getting to the point where the rogue's player starts wondering why nobody is reacting (he's the least dangerous person in the tent that's not there with the sole purpose of writing what someone else says) he's disarmed by my royal spymaster who then collects both of their daggers and flips his back to him. With that stupidity out of the way the party is sent to go buy some pigs.\n\nOn the way out of the camp the rogue again makes a crappy perception roll to realize that none of the guards are carrying money on them in a place that he can get to it. I get them out of camp, point them down the road, and hope to hell that the rogue doesn't just run off because \"It's what my character would do.\"\n\nRogue and Sorceress have a lovely conversation as we make our way down the road. A few scenery changes later we make it to our first encounter and everyone rolls high enough to stop before running into the trap. I figure out where everyone is, get them to trigger the trap harmlessly, pull out the map and begin combat. Kobolds had rigged a falling log trap, had one tunnel out but not where party was (I was planning on them stopping short, they all crossed past before triggering it), and began attacking. Kobolds in the middle of the day were supposed to be an easy fight, kobolds in the middle of the day spent several rounds trying to hit with slings or dropped rocks and failing miserably. Party eventually cleans up, stops the one that's trying to fly away and kills it. Rogue loots 8 crappy daggers, sorceress loots 6 crappy slings, jointly loot the body of a clerk who fell victim to the other log trap including pulling off his shirt. Rogue talks more with sorceress and we eventually make it to the farm.\n\nThieves cant scratched on the gate post says to deal with the man, not the woman. Rogue goes up and tries to talk to the man in thieves cant which goes over predictably poorly and then we retcon it never happening. They tell the farmer what they want and the farmer offers them the going rate for pigs. The rogue decides he'll be negotiating and asks for a better price (not naming a price, just asking for a better one). Farmer comes back with the original price, 6 gold. Rogue's player complains that he has proficiency in persuasion and I respond that he should try haggling. Rogue begins to haggle and in his second offer he decides to try to put the dead clerk's shirt into the bargain. I let the player know this is a bad idea and we decide that never happened either. Several rounds of haggling happen featuring the rogue announcing that these pigs are for the army and I realize that the rogue and sorceress have forgotten what the different types of currency are worth compared to each other. Sorceress finally decides she'll try intimidation, doesn't fail completely miserably, and I give them the same price that the clerk that bough pigs earlier got as a final price.\n\nGo get pigs, mud mephits attack, party recognizes obvious cues that one of them summoned some of the others, does ok and farmer rolls 20's or 1's with a bow. Finish combat and the party goes inside the pig shed with the farmer to get the now frightened pigs. Rogue tries to renegotiate, Sorceress is blamed and then rogue's player takes almost a minute telling her to go outside and check to see if she can tell what those things were. She does and rolls well and comes back to tell the farmer which doesn't work because reasons. Rogue continues to announce that the pigs are for the army, farmer continues not to care, rogue tries his best to talk the farmer into giving them the pregnant sow in the other pen, including trying to lie about the guy's wife saying it was ok. I'm not a huge stickler on roleplaying to make a roll but this guy is a farmer and he knows better and knows his wife knows better too. Rogue's player continues to whine that he is proficient in persuasion and deception. Monk casually remarks that the sow probably summoned the mephits, I make him roll deception, he rolls well and the farmer is now pretty sure that pig is magical. Now that his concern about the origin of the mephits is taken care of he offers an extra pig because the mephits would have eaten it if the party hadn't been there. Party returns with pigs, pigs go to be slaughtered while party goes to report. The lord captain won't give them a reward for doing their job, even if the rogue has proficiency in persuasion.\n\nDinner happens, sorceress leaves (player had to get up early, session was all but done). Announce that the meat was undercooked and get con saves. A man approaches the rogue, asks him to go talk somewhere private. The rogue agrees and follows the man, rolling a horrible perception roll to see if anyone was nearby. Man walks him to a tent just beyond darkvision range of anyone at the dinner, takes him inside and we get our second family reunion of the night.\n\nThe man claims to be the rogue's father who, in the rogue's backstory had killed his mother. Rogue's drive in life is to kill this man. I decided that this was the noble that the rogue had tried to steal that pocketwatch from and gave it to him. The father then gives the son a dagger and tells him to do what he needs to. Rogue's player decides this would be a great opportunity to stop doing what his character would do and attempts to sheath the dagger. A couple contested rolls later dad is dead and fades to nothingness. Rogue's player gets an index card with his new weapon. +1 to attack rolls against humanoids, +2 damage on successful attacks against humanoids, weapon returns to his hand after 6 seconds or at the beginning of his next round.\n\nTry to sneak outside and walk directly into a man looking to kill the rogue for humiliating his friends in training, rogue kills the guy with his fancy new dagger, fails the wisdom saving throw and gets to spend a round reliving one of his ancestors slicing the throats of some innocent people and stabbing a holy man in the eye. I trade his new weapon card for what his new weapon actually is now that he's bound it to himself. \n\nRogue comes back to the real world holding a dagger standing over a dead body surrounded by soldiers/guards and is taken away. Lord Commander in the tent tells rogue to kiss ass when the Lord Captain comes to decide his fate. Rogue fails to kiss ass, almost \"your majestied\" the Lord Captain (he is very much not the queen), is relieved of his posessions, and gets to spend the night in a hole in the ground awaiting execution. Monk does not metagame and goes and gets drunk. Morning comes and rogue goes to the gallows, decides his argument today is going to be \"look for the weapon I used to kill him,\" is hanged poorly. Starts trying to cut the rope with the dagger that will almost always come back to him (but rolling disadvantage because I was tired of his shit), starts taking damage, player rage-rolls several more tries to cut the rope and declares himself dead. Argues with me when I tell him he isn't dead. I'm a sucker for a good trope and have one of the NPCs shoot the rope with a longbow.\n\nThe rogue's player was very unhappy with his new magic item and wasn't sure he wanted to keep playing that character. Rogue asked a tailor during the third session if he knew how to remove curses from items, was pointed to the paladin that had walked him over. Paladin takes him back to their tents to look at it, it pops back to the rogue's hand, Paladin casts Detect Good &amp; Evil, points out someone the rogue had seen as a cleric in the practice rounds as someone that would probably know how to remove the curse. \n\nCleric has a nice chat with the rogue, knows more about what's happened than the rogue has told anyone and takes the dagger to look at it. He tells the rogue the stipulations of the weapon: that it would accept being reforged and having metal added to it but it wouldn't at the size of a dagger accept being split and that this could only be done by a sufficiently skilled smith; that he needed to see what the dagger was showing him; and that he had to use it well and for good to have the chance to lift the curse. The rogue's player missed most of that because he was entirely focused on how this cleric could hold on to the dagger. Also on if this cleric would recognize the robe he'd pulled off of the cleric in the previous session (I realized at this point that he didn't realize there was a difference between a clerk and a cleric).\n\nSession happens, he makes a few valid kills, saves once fails a couple times. In these flashbacks he experiences through the ancestor and he's really confused as he throws an axe into a fleeing peasant woman and it returns to him only to be thrown into her running child. Then going through the motions of suplication to a king only to kill him on the spot. At the end of the session he's still not sure he likes his new weapon because he has no idea how to get rid of the curse. Monk tells him I flat out told him that he needed to use the thing. I might let him get a belt of returning later, for now what he has is:\n\nSins of the Father (1d4 piercing)\n\nDagger - Light, Finesse, Thrown (20/60)\n\nReturns to your hand after 6 seconds or at the start of the next round of combat when dropped, thrown, or placed.\n\nUse against humanoids: +1 on attack rolls, +2 damage on hit\n\nWhen killing humanoids: Make a contested Wisdom save. On failure you are unable to act and attacks against you have advantage until the end of your next turn.\n\nThat was my first attempt at making a magic weapon, moderately cursed, sort of what my rogue asked for and he hates it. Still, we wrapped up a good bit of his backstory, he got the pocketwatch and the hanging and wound up with a dagger that almost always comes back. The monk got to wonder what kind of creature the cleric was because he was in the tent room beyond where they were all talking and saw the flap open when the cleric left the room but never saw him. Monk is minus a magic item but does have a homebrew for flavor monk weapon (spiked gauntlets and leg guards, 1d6 piercing, the equivalent of a spear but can't be thrown and can't be disarmed). He didn't even think about the last part until I told him.\n\nAlso that pig is definitely magical now.",

        "text": "Cassius Brutus needed to conquer something, and he needed to do it quickly. He was widely regarded as craven and incompetent, thanks to his unsuccessful siege of Athens, where his battering rams and men burned under the gates. Though young, he had already spent five years as a general and had nothing to show for it. Being 21 and not having won a battle was a sign that perhaps he should retire to some backwards province and be forgotten. \n\nHowever, he was summoned aboard the navy from Roman Thermon, alongside what remained of the army that besieged  Athens. Before he left, he hired some mercenaries: two hoplite units and two Peltasts, along with a unit of Hastati and Triarii. \n\nOn the ships, he met his kinsman Titus Brutus, as well as his in-law Kaeso Tiberius. Though the two men were younger than Cassius, they were considered better generals. Kaeso, in particular, was renowned as a man who grasped the conceptual side of battle. The only redeeming quality Cassius had was that he had seen battle in person, albeit a defeat. \n\nThe orders were to sail to Sparta and besiege the city, under the command of Kaeso. They were to take the city by any means necessary. Sparta had quickly constructed stone walls from nothing over the course of seven years. Kaeso hired an additional unit of Peltasts to bolster the army. Cassius recommended that the army build a sap point instead of rams, as the burning rams and archer towers would cause unnecessary casualties. They do so, and six months later, in 263 BC, they assault.\n\nThe defending garrison was small, but formidable. They were under the command of a general and his bodyguard, two hoplite units, a unit of Greek Cavalry,  a unit of Cavalry Militia, and their elite unit of Spartan Hoplites. The Greek general set his cavalry units in the city plaza, his infantry on the wall above the city gates, and his bodyguard right behind the gate. The Roman army set up on the south side of the city, attacking north.\n\nKaeso made the first moves, ordering the Hastati to enter the sap point and all the mercenary units, both peltast and hoplite, forward. The wall crumbled, revealing that th Greek general had adopted the age old tactic of placing a hoplite phalanx in a tight area. The peltasts opened fire on the Greeks, but hit mainly shields. Kaeso ordered one unit of his hoplites to engage them. The Greek hoplites beat them back easily, causing the mercenary unit to rout. Not a single member of that mercenary unit survived the fight, as the archer towers shot every routing man. The archer towers also inflict casualties on the peltasts.\nKaeso was unfazed.  He ordered the remaining mercenary hoplite unit to attack. This time around, the Romans won, gaining access to the city entrance. Unfortunately, this means that the units have to run a gauntlet past a series of hostile archer towers. Kaeso orders the mercenaries, as well as all three generals, to run past that gauntlet into an in-road that is a safe distance from the towers.\n\nThat street lead to the northern half of the city plaza, where the enemy cavalry were ready to fight. The mercenaries were too tired to rush in there and win, and Kaeso saw no need to send in the Roman infantry through the gauntlet, so he ordered all three generals and their bodyguard units to attack the cavalry. They do so, quickly inflicting major casualties. The enemy cavalry was surrounded and slaughtered easily. It seemed that the day had been won.\n\nHowever, the Greeks had moved off of the wall and marched northwards to greet the Roman generals. The Greek and Roman general units attacked each other. The Roman generals were a bit tired, so Kaeso ordered the Hastati and Triarii to run the gauntlet, as well ad have the mercenaries enter the north side of the plaza. The fatigue also caused what would otherwise be an easy 3-on-1 general battle to grind on for longer than expected. At the same time, the mercenaries engaged the hoplite units, one at full strength and one battered from the skirmish at the sap point.\n\nThe Romans finally killed the Greek general and pushed his bodyguard back. Unfortunately, the pushing was right into the frontlines of the Spartan Hoplites, who had just joined the battle. The Roman generals, fatigued and outnumbered, were no match for the Spartans. At the same time, the two Greek hoplite units had beaten back one of the mercenary peltasts, routed another into the city plaza, and was making headway on the remaining mercenary hoplite and peltast unit. The generals became discouraged and fled, not returning to battle.\n\nExcept for cowardly Cassius and seventeen of his bodyguard. He fled far enough to avoid the Spartans, but saw the Triarii in an atrium on the south side of the city. There he rallied the routing Peltast unit. On the north side of the city, the Hastati joined the mercenary hoplite and peltast unit.\n\nThe Spartans went northward, while the full-strength Greek hoplite unit went south. On the north side of the city, the Spartans cut through the peltast unit like butter, causing a rout. The Spartans then attacked the Roman hoplite and Hastati units It was too much. Both units routed. The Spartans only had to finish off the south side to utterly destroy the besieging army, and, by implication, Roman ambitions in Hellas.\n\nThe only problem the Spartans faced was that Cassius had miraculously become not only brave, but a military genius. Deploying hammer-and-anvil tactics, he decimated the attacking Greeks and caused their rout, though at the cost of the remaining peltast unit. The shouts of \"vae victus\" invigorated the routing Hastati and mercenary hoplites, both of whom regained their composure. Cassius rushed into the city square to find his biggest challenge yet: 100 Spartan Hoplites, anxious for battle. Sure, the rest of the Greek army was decimated, but the rest of the Roman army was exhausted from hours of running and fighting, and the Spartans did enough cardio to remain fresh. The Spartans charged right at Cassius, who devised a plan so idiotic that it could actually work.\n\nCassius, the coward, ran. Specifically, he ran around the city plaza, from corner to corner. The Spartans were great warriors, but boneheads. they chased him around the square. While Cassius, on horseback, was able to run fast enough to stop, so as to give his horses breathers, the Spartans were on foot, and had to continuously run to keep up. The wild but futile goose (or rather, horse) chase continued for nearly an hour before the Spartans became exhausted. Cassius noticed that his men had been idle the entire time, and thus were fit to fight again. He chased the Spartans into the Triarii, and ordered the Hastati and mercenary hoplites to encircle the Spartans and finish them off. It was a moment of brilliant stupidity, and of brave cowardice, that won the battle. The encircled Spartans fought to the last man, but died exhausted. Cassius was redeemed.\n\nThat is how cowardice conquered Sparta.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4b1lb5/eclipse_phase_the_fall_of_the_orient_express/",
        "text": "Eclipse Phase is it's own setting wise. It's Post-Transhuman: The Setting and Mechanics take great pains to separate the person ('Ego') from the body ('Morph'). Most people have 'Cortical Stacks' which takes a full reading of the brain every few seconds, so, if the body dies, the greatest expense is paying for a new one. It's also allows Characters to draw their minds from as varied background as Uplifted Animals (Parrots, Octopuses, Primates, Dolphins) and AI, as well as your standard human from practically anywhere in the solar system..\n\nIt's also Post-Apocalyptic: Ten years ago, a military Seed AI (AIs with the capability to exponentially improve themselves) network called the TITANS went Haw-Haw and created the Exsurgent Virus (an unknowable, practically alien thing that infects, corrupts and dominates... Everything, easily hopping the Biological/Technological barrier.) The Infected TITANS destroyed human habitation on Earth, killing 90% of Transhumanity, the survivors mostly evacuating via 'Egocasting' - Leaving their morphs behind and transmitting the Egos only. This was a good thing, because Humanity's Extraterrestrial Colonies would have collapsed under the weight of that many Morphs. They practically did with the relatively small numbers of Morphs that were evacuated. And the economy fell over anyway as suddenly, there was a lot more labour than jobs.\n\nIn the wake of that, as humans are wont to do, they quarreled, the inner system coalescing around Hypercapitalism, the outer system around a menagerie of Anarchist/Socialist worldviews, and Jupiter... Well, officially a Republic, really a Junta. Nobody likes Jupiter, particularly as they're the only Anti-Trans-humanist faction in the setting.\n\nIn the Aftermarth of 'The Fall' as it was known, a network of Kill-Sats sprung up around Earth, with... Odd programming. No one knows what the programming is (or who put them there) but they seem to have worked After all, everyone else isn't dead.\n\nIn addition, 'Firewall' appeared. Firewall is a Conspiracy Theory in the flesh, but, fortunately, with a good goal (in theory): Identify, locate, and neutralise existential threats to Transhumanity. It's very cellular, with various internal factions and differing viewpoints between cells. In a typical Eclipse Phase Campaign, the Player Characters take on the mantle of Firewall 'Sentinels' basically Investigators/troubleshooters (find trouble, shoot it), who receive orders from their 'Proxy'.\n\n---\n\nThis is not a typical campaign.\n\n---\n\nThe *Orient Express*: One of the slowest ships in the Sol system. Large and old, Antimatter engines rumoured to be designed by illegal AI, unparalleled cargo capacity. She's being going over a decade now, inner system to outer system, with a multi-confessional crew, Corp and Automonist both, simply because, really, the *Orient Express* is too vital to lose. It may help though that Engineering basically lives so far away from everyone else that they might as well be on a different ship.\n\nRight now, the *Orient Epxress* is on the outbound flight, to the outer system. Our two Player Characters:\n\n* **Napoleon** - The Lab-Escapee Uplifted Octopus Pirate, who is also infected with the Watts McCloud virus, a seemingly non-contagious version of the Exsurgent Virus that gives the infected 'Magic-Like' or 'Psionic' Powers. (Yes, really. This is somewhat normal by EC Standards.) He's wearing an uplifted version of an Octopus Morph (ends of the tentacles split into fingers, essentially, and air-breathing.)\n\n* **Aali** - The human Biosculptor, a cross between a Surgeon and an Artist that specialises in using the Biological Morph as his canvas. He's wearing a Menton (Morph optomised for mental aptitude) with *heavy* investment put into it. He had an... Interesting Childhood in the inner system pre-fall, before defecting to the automonists, first the Titanian University and later a Scum Swarm.\n\nBoth had their reasons for being in the inner system. For Napoleon, revenge. He'd had a lead on one of the researchers who had so greviously wronged him in the faility in which he was uplifted. It was... Fruitful. For Aali, a discreete client rather interested in the more... Practical uses of his skills. Particulary his fine surgeon's hand at Implant surgery.\n\nThe *Orient Express* isn't a liner. It's not luxery, you're practically Cargo. Practically all those awake for the passage are in Biomorphs. Most of the people in Synthmorphs just switch themselves off for the trip (makes it cheaper as well.)\n\nThey got on seperately, did not know each other. Both carried pistols. For Aali, it was just what he carried. For Napoleon, his other weapons were loaded as Cargo (and he couldn't get anything bigger past the crew, try as he might.)\n\nAali applied for the use of a Surgical suite, and advertised his services. Clearence would take 3 months, but he was on for 4 and a half. He ran into an old collegue from his Titanian days, and chatted a lot.\n\nNapoleon chatted with a member of the ID Crew (Ego Smugglers) and taught some idiot who muttered 'those types shouldn't be allow with the rest of us' in his presence that Octopuses are really quite deadly when pissed of. Fortunately, he was left alive at the end of it, thanks to the speedy intervention of the crew.\n\nIt is somewhat noticable to our Player Characters that the *Orient Express* is... Somewhat long in the tooth. Essentially, she's so past date for Dry-Dock (for a given value of dry in space) time and care that to do so now would be economically catastrophic for both her and possibly Transhumanity as a whole. The ship is arranged as a central long core section, bridge at the fore and engineering and engines aft, with five Stretching Modules arranged parallel to this central core. The Cargo Pods are, in theory, immediately detachable from the Core in case of emergency. Careful viewing of the welds and repair works indicate that this may no longer be the case.\n\nWhilst the appearence of a new passnger always rouses some interest, this one roused a lot. Aali both loved and hated it: A synthmorph, but so cunningly crafted and modelled after the human form that it almost seemed to be a perfect copy, down to the emulation of biological functions for... Posterity's sake. She came aboard in the presence of her 'father'. Most terribly odd.\n\n---\n\nThe *Orient Express* found itself in the void between Mars and the belt, and suddenly made a stop. Suspicious, Napoleon went a-sneaking, and happened to oberve the loading a a heavily locked and sealed Martian Mega-Corp Cargo pod aboard towards the aft... With it's own Security team coming along for the ride. Oddly enough, the disturbingly human Synthmorph, (Emily, as it happens) is there with him, though how she wondered onto it is anyone's guess. Napoleon tries to reach into her mind, expecting the stone wall of a Cyberbrain, but there's something that shouldn't be there, something think the touch of an Async... On a cyberbrain, an impossibility.\n\nForunately, Emily is shockingly naive and doesn't realise that attempted mind-reading is something you should object to.\n\nNow, Napoleon's an Async. Watts-McCloud, something Exsurgent in him, something not properly understood. It gives him a sense for a danger, and now he can't fucking sleep. Can't think straight when your brain's screaming at you. One of the crew as well, an Adrian Smithson.\n\nDays pass, and the screaming doesn't stop,doesn't change,  but he's building up a tolerence to it. And then the scream turns from a stream to a torrent, matching the real-world scream of a women a few honeycomb cells down. People tramp into the Corridors to see what's going on, as the woman screams gibberish and vomits tentacles through the arms, as indescribable black cuts the corridor, holding in place for five seconds before falling away to reveal the endless emptiness of space, as we drift free of the *Orient Express*.\n\nThe GM cracks his kunckles and asks for some Free-Fall rolls, to avoid dying from getting chucked out into the Black, as long-unused emergency doors are slow to engage and slow to close. Then Fray rolls to avoid the debries and people hurtling past them. For Aali, more Free-Fall rolls to hurriedly clamber to an emergency Vacc suit. We suffer lucidity damage.\n\nThe doors finally shut, and everyone not in a Vacuum suit is already dead, and most of the rest are wounded in some form or other. Aali isn't a Paramedic, and it shows as he fails to save many of those he attempts to aid. Fortunately, his meagre skills, combined with his wrist-mounted Nanobot Swarms giving him the tools he needs on demand means that he can same some, at least.\n\nTo the fore, a sealed door to the black. To the aft, another sealed door. Turns out there's other people on the other side of it. After some commucation with the crewperson on the other side ('I'm sorry, I'm under orders to not open this door') we're let through.\n\nSituation: Poor. Few crew, surviving ranking officer dimwit. One Engineering staff (Priya, woman manning the door.)\n\nPower: Emergency Only\n\nFood: Far more than we'd ever eat\n\nWater: None\n\nSurviving Cargo: Unknown\n\nCargo Manifest: Unknown (only avaliable in main section.)\n\nPosition: Unknown\n\nVelocity: Unknown\n\nBearing: Unknown\n\nCommunications with *Orient Express*: Unavaliable\n\nForming a quick leadership council (ignoring the ranking officer) with the PCs, Priya, a surviving Ship's surgeon and two useful others (Religious type, good at keeping people calm, and a freelance Judge (one of the more Individualist Automonists) we resolve to recover the cortical stacks of the dead, and restore one of the crew (Adrian Smithson, as it turns out) who knows First Aid.\n\nPriority: Water. To make water, need Hydrogen and Oxygen. Can produce oxygen with power via combination of electricity and C02. Need Hydrogen. Aali declares that, with access to power, Hydrogen can be isolated from the hydrocarbons found in the stored food. (Well, we thought it was plausible.) Fortunately, Aali has Academics (Biology), Academics (Biochemisty) and Academics (Chemistry.) He has it well in hand.\n\nWe, the PCs and Priya (we didn't pay the Freelance Judge to aid us) begin to travel, through exposed sections, to Engineering, We need power, and hopefully, Engineering is where we'll find it. On the way, Aali (who, Pre-Fall, worked in the Asteriod Belt on rickety old ships, and knows his astromony) glanced up at the stars to orient himself, relative to Sol's elliptic plane.\n\nThe shock of the truth gives Aali mental trauma. He does not recognise, in the slightest, any of the stars. The only conclusion, therefore, is that we are not in the Sol system. He blurts it out loud, and poor nervous shell-shocked Priya turns even paler.\n\nAbout halfway through our journey, distance wise (no, actually, pretty much exactly halfway) we come across the previously aforementioned secured crate. Complete with two security Goons. They're in Fury morphs, combat made, the aggression dampened with pack mentality and cooperation that seems to typically female sexed. And their job? Protect the damn crate.\n\nSo, of course, they point the guns at us. They're the only two survivors, as it turns out (well, there was a third, but he was 140 miles away and counting. His life support was due to run out in 45 minutes.) After relaying the situation to them (Eg: Totally screwed,) they accompy us. Not that we get a choice in the matter. We reach engineering, and we finally Rouse Priya from her *of fuck me* shell with some good old fashioned engineering. (As Old fashioned as Antimatter generators can get.) Fortunately, the Antimatter generaor is A) On out bit on the Express and B) Still intact.\n\nNot that we would have noticed if it wasn't, having been vaporised instants after.\n\nForunately, there's enough going on here for the Two Goons to restock their Life Support (not so much for number 3, who passes away during the repair period.)\n\nPriya, luckily, knows her engineering, and after two hours work, she plugs a few final things in, throws a few switches, and declares that we've either got power or we're dead.\n\nFortuantely, we have power.\n\nThis time, the two Furies ask to accompany us back (given out situation, not much out there to steal their crate now.) We agree, and we take the now powered elevator back to the habitabed sections.\n\nAali gets to work, along with his former collegue, who survived, and, before people die of thirst, we get water. He's not done though, working with the computer systems to work out exactly where we happened to be.\n\nLater he relays his findings.\n\nA) We are not in the Sol System\n\nB) We are in the Milky Way Galaxy\n\nC) We are not in the Sol System's spiral arm\n\nD) We are not being noticably being effected by a Star's Gravity: We are not in any Solar system.\n\nE) Something is blotting out a small section of the the viewable stars.\n\nF) The blotted out area is increasing in size\n\nG) Given premises (E) and (F) I can conclude\n\nH) Something large enough to blot out stars is approaching us\n\nI) AARRGGHH\n\nLeaving further calucations on subjects E-I to my survivng collegue, the Furies are able to finangle their psycholoical programming to allow us to open their damn box without them gunning us down, given that it's at the center of the *Orient Express* area we're sitting on and WE'RE NOT IN THE FUCKING SOL SYSTEM.\n\nSo, back over there, and we open the Crate (Well, the Furies, as muscled as they are, do.) In their is a... Breathing is the wrong word, but useful enough, metal Hourglass, held in place by human tech devices above and below it, and it seems to sing.  An Hourglass bomb, Napoleon relates. TITAN tech. Now, Napoleon is a Async, and one of his abilities is 'Grok', the ability to reach out and tocuh any mechnical device, and thus understand it's function and how to use it via the 'Grok' power.\n\nHe reaches out. Oh, he understands it. It's a component of a multi-dimensional machine. It understands him as well.\n\nAali, furthest back, notices time disort before his eyes, speeding up then slowing down before snapping back to normal. He reaches for his pistol, calling Napoleon back, but then relents, seeing no other option for getting back to Sol.\n\nIt's then that he gets shot in the back. Whirling round, he sees the suitless, gibbering, tentacled form of Adrian Smithson, clutching an SMG. Aali and Napoleon giving battle as the Furies don't move an inch, Priya cowering behind the TITAN device (why Priya, why?)\n\nEvery shot that hits him sends tendrils of blood flying back out of him, but the tendrils have minds all of their own, and indeed, at one point, when sent flying back by a burst from Aali's pistol, The thing that once was Smithson shoots a new wound in himself for the blood to gush out of him like a tail to whip himself back onto the *Orient Express*. When he finally expires, he vomits up a long, stem-like tendril, opening up at the end into a grotesque rose like thing.\n\nPriya is able to free the Furies: A long-forgotten, buried in the OS override code was transmitted to their Suits, locking them up.\n\nWe traverse back the way we came, wondering what will await us in the inhabited section.",

        "text": "**Phoenix With No Wings** *Eldritch the Abomination*\n\nWell my favorite way to wake up is to have some oaf come bang on my rubble-of-a-door and scream at me to wake up after only getting three hours of sleep. Oh wait, that's closer to my least favorite way to wake up. Either way that's what I got. Cass (who by divine assistance currently does not need to eat or sleep) decided everyone else needed to wake up and go help out some poor people. Not in the revolution way, but in the healing kind of way. Normally I'm for it (gotta keep em healthy if they're going to revolt) but I was still half asleep so I was a bit testy. \n\nWe get to the residential area. I do a little Live Aid concert, get some healing songs going. Icarus goes full messiah and summons a large snake to heal people, very prophetic. Cass somehow miraculously actually heals some people. We do this for a bit until we see some guys die and a creepy woman on the ground. Icarus turns into a Nylon Lion and turns her in. Turns out she was a pit criminal that was guilty of being ugly.\n\nBy some twist of fate we manage to stay in a group all day. We got to ComiCon 35, which is where all the playwrights and comic artists of the nerdy subcultures of the world gather and sell merch, sign autographs, and talk to fans. We had to go because Cass heard something about an Oktaku tribe or something. Basically we were expecting criminals and of course had to go do what Cassius's murderous whim was (excuse me, arrest-erous whim). He bought some kind of dragon tail thing to try to be a Wiaboo, but small upside I got to meet Lady Morgana Whistleroot--author of my favorite play Spectres of the Wild. She's even more enthralling than I could imagine. Tall, slender red-head, very mature and calm. Normally I'm pretty cool around new people but I was so excited to meet her I kept rambling on and on about how much I liked her work. and it turns out she's a fan of my music! And I got her AviDroid ID.\n\nBut silver linings don't come without a cloud. The Oktaku tribe did attack. Cass and Icarus managed to get two of them down with ease. Then Cass gets the bright idea to try to heal the guy with guts pouring out of him. Ended up taking on his wounds. Fantastic. The third guy shows up out of nowhere and kills Icarus. I feel like I could have helped somehow... I didn't know who needed me. And now Icarus was dead. For real this time. If you know where to look you can see the life leave a body's eyes the moment that death decides to keep them. I felt responsible. And I ended up blaming Cassius for it. \n\nWe took his corpse to Father Isaiah and he said he could help, for a hell of a price. We took his body to the dismantled church and I prepared him a little bed. I put some nature stuff around him, I don't know, I guess I thought it was appropriate. I used his staff to try and summon some snakes. I got one. Thankfully I can talk to them now. I told him to get some buddies and protect his messiah, and not to worry because we were going to try to bring him back. \n\nMeantime, I had business, plus I couldn't stay there and stare at my dead friend for much longer. I mean in the past five days I've seen Cat die twice, Icarus die twice, Cass die once, and Asgar die the day I found him, plus Grizz. And there's a shit storm coming between the undead, the poor, the Morbolds, the criminals, and apparently the fuckin snakes too. \n\nI pop on back to ComiCon and find me a hacker who rigs up my AviDroid so I can do a forced-mass-broadcast. Hopefully I can tap in and fuck up a mass of undead with sound so we don't have to painstakingly fight 10,000 of them. Guy that sold me the shit was a fan of mine but didn't recognize me at first. Heh. And then Morgana sent me a flirty little message so that felt good. \n\nWe (Cat and I) get back to the church just before Father Isaiah gets there. Cass is talking with Killin, who is very upset that Icarus is continually dying. Icarus gets resurrected in this enthralling light show while Ded is at Cassius's side furiously taking notes. He's gonna be an alright god one day. Icarus's snakes tell his resurrected self that there's a full-out snake war going on and a giant serpent with wings shows up to take him to battle. Cassius has to go fight Balrus at a clock tower. Cat's family shows up and requests a very serious private talk. And Asgar says he smells the mystery meat that brought him here and that we have to go check it out. So here I am, torn between my only four friends, all going off to deal with their own shit. I think Asgar needs me the most, plus I mean, I owe him. So we took off into the night, in four different directions just as the clocktower that just exploded would be striking midnight. May Death and Ded have mercy on us all in the coming days\n\n**Welcome to Celebrity Deathmatch** *DM*\n\nOur four heroes split to face their destinies. Squeezus went to face his antithesis, the Ouroboran prophet Azi Dahaka. What Icarus lacked in experience compared to his nemesis, he made up for in his strong will, wit, and sense of righteousness. Cassius Bellerone sought to confront his contemporary paladin, the War Chief Balrus. Although his bond was with a nondeitic patron, Cassius knew Ded would not let him down when he needed him most. Eldritch assisted Asgor in tracking down whatever strange event brought him here. Though ostensibly callous and aloof, Lucien Dredge has proven to be a great friend to those in need and his childhood deathbuddy was no exception. Caistine Pegason boarded a Pegason Carriage with her cousin, Aiden to discuss familial matters. She has come quite a long way from the naive farm girl she was when she arrived, despite Aiden's taunts and refusal to see it.\n\nHaving had quite enough, Caistine disembarked the carriage and turned into a giant bird to find Icarus. Icarus learned that Astriel, his Disciple of Population, initiated the first skirmish in a reaction to the news of Icarus's death. Icarus surveyed the scene and also learned that Azi Dahaka awaited him for a druid's duel, a one on one fight to death where the druids were limited to shapeshifting into their primal spirit, the origin of their tell. At the start of the battle, Icarus took the form of a massive stone deer with electrified antlers. Of course, Azi Dahaka took the form of a swarm of locusts and found himself useless against Icarus's impenetrable nylon hide. Icarus zapped Azi's essence with his antlers, absorbing the Ouroboros soul within. Maintaining perfect control of the fight, Icarus handily reduced Azi's offensive to scraps. As Azi launched one final assault with a locust swarm, Squeezus became a deer with the aspect of the snake and consumed his Anti-Messiah. He found himself filled with the energy of the twin snake deities, reforging the snake essence within him. The Staff of Squeezus and the consumed Staff of Azi Dahaka also reforged, into the Staff of Icarus, the symbol of balance between Ouroboros and Daedalus. \n\nEldritch followed the scent with Asgor to the palace ballroom and found a wedding, waiting for him. Priscilla was adorned in white. She explained how Asgor was a gift to Lucien, from her. She learned of his existence upon torturing the information out of his parents, whom she also brought to the wedding as incentive to have Lucien marry her. With little other choice, Mr. Dredge walked down the aisle. He provided rings. Prissy and Lucy bantered their vows and everything seemed happy and picturesque. Then, The Abomination himself stabbed Zilla Zora in her Blood-Infused Heart (copyright 1733 Priscilla \"Priszilla\" Zora) and quickly whipped out a melody to enchant the guards who threatened his parents. Asgor leapt into action as well, nearly meeting his demise, but by the end of it, Eldritch had two living parents, a living wolf friend, and two dead Zillaheads. Also, he was now the King. Priscilla was adorned in red.\n\nCassius Bellerone made his journey to the Mirage Clocktower to find a group of paramilitants who identified themselves as the Fibonacci Army. They allowed him passage into the Clocktower, where Balrus awaited. They also warned him that his father awaited him. The young paladin climbed the dark staircase, nearing finding himself wedged in the climb. He exited and asked the FA how Balrus got up there and they directed Cass to a system of pulleys and levers. The Ded Warrior rose to his most challenging foe, yet, Balrus. Balrus turned to greet his young comrade, Bellerone Senior dangling from his fist over the side of the Clocktower. After a short parley, the two Paladins reached an accord to work together and then fight for the throne, mano a mano. Cassius mentioned offhand that he wanted the throne to give his nondeity godhood. Balrus had a choice. Allow this young Paladin to further empower a nondeity on equal ground along his own ancient god of conquest and victory, or wipe out this entire would-be god's following while his only Paladin lacked the sheer might of actual divinity. He made the wrong choice. Cassius and Balrus locked into a brutal melee, trading blows while Cassius remained immune to Balrus's hammer due to excellent planning. Balrus resorted to using his goring tusks and upended the entire catwalks, sending Cassius and Balrus tumbling down. Balrus died on impact, Cassius died when Balrus's tusk severed his spine. Cassius awoke in the space between spaces and met with Ded for another chat. Ded gave him a grave ultimatum. Cassius understood who Ded was. What he was for. What he had made him do. To return to life, he had to verbally seal his devotion to Ded. Cassius had a choice. He made it.\n\nEldritch and Cass had uncomfortable conversations amidst Cass's family drama and Eldritch's past sexual exploits. The quartet reunited at the zoo, like reunions should be. The sun is rising on a strange Friday in Quirktown.\n\n**I Wanna Know, Have You Ever Seen The Reign?** *DM*\n\n*The Advanced History of Quirktown Vol. 3*\n\n*An Honest Reaccounting of The Reign by Jernus Likte*\n\n*Chapter 13*:\n\n*\"I think absolute Monarchy*...\n\n*is absolutely Malarkey...\"*\n\n*-King Eldritch I, member of The Reign*\n\n\"The four had arrived into town a short while ago but had over seen completely absolving Quirktown of their sins and imposing a reign of new judgement, coronation ceremony a mere week incoming, and proceeded to immediately become prominent adventurers by turning a simple cooking assistant gig into an increasingly dark whodunit. Beloved advisor of the Quirktown King, Elanor the Sleepy was accidentally baked into a fake cake by the cook the Reign was tasked with helping prepare the royal feast. This orcish chef, Madrion the Forgetful, baked a wooden structure designed to house Elanor as she was to break out and dance for the King's Birthday. Unfortunately, she slept through the baking. \nThe Reign immediately took the responsibility upon themselves one way or another and received orders from the King to retrieve Madrion who had escaped during the ensuing chaos. The successive events led to the birth of a messiah in the Reign, some kind of snake deity formed a primal bond with the nondescript druid (though the druid's bloodline and manifest primal tell suggest a forest origin, shaman advisory has suggested no such energy flows through him; the primal spirits that imbue him are abstractions of civilization. There has been no history of there ever being an \"Urban Druid\" before so believing it to be so is difficult) a Paladin serving a strange unknown god he claims is \"Ded\", and revolt in the Poor District that borderlines infectious with its upheaval against the tyranny of the ruling class in my city. The Reign toppled the police regime, exposing Quirkenmire's criminal employment scheme, designed to reduce crime rate by reclassifying it as business. Who could blame them for the release of the Pitees? They uncovered a corrupt to the core system that exploited the poor to the profit of violent criminals and locked up those that wouldn't play Quirkball. If anything, The Reign have only tried the correct justice in this decaying state from their very first action. This includes abridging the sentences of all criminals held by the very same decaying state. This includes breaking ghost law in court to win a case against ex-Advisor to the Advisor to the King, Chv8. This includes stirring the poor into retaliatory action against their murderous oppressors. And the most important message they left us was the day King Eldritch I declared Anarchy.\n\nReports indicate it began as a rather mundane followup day to their defeating of their most predatory nemeses, perhaps they used the beat in the high-stakes gerrymandering to settle an old debt of Squeezus's. The Adaptor he had acquired from Emma Henrli under the good faith he'd take care of Arl Wizzlebang, a pitee that tormented her prior to his incarceration, had yet to be paid for. They investigated into the matter and found his suicide scene. Eavesdroppers to the ensuing conversation have collectively reported that it was entirely an argument about whether or not the three (Lady Pegason had flown to locate her family and later meet her demise) should kill each other. Apparently, the essence of The Enchanter became entwined into the sword and tried to convince P.P.I. Cassius Bellerone to kill his party members, an idea, which he neither seemed forced or enthralled to consider, he greatly considered. This is was quickly resolved as they dismissed the whole thing and had the sword disintegrated. Truly direct and wise actions from the Reign. Allegedly, the ambassador, Squeezus's birth mother, appeared to him and they traded words. They parted ways shortly after with Squeezus moving to his snake collective, P.P.I. Bellerone to his family, and King Eldritch I to his palace. Squeezus returned and apparently prayed to receive guidance. Whatever he heard, he promptly gathered his flock and was seen leaving them with several angelic snakes appearing to attempt to stop him. This author may only assume that Squeezus was put in a position to not lead his movement anymore, but what that position is, I cannot say. He fled to say his goodbyes, managing to locate the place of Cat's demise and her murderous cousin, Aiden in the process. The ensuing combat saw Squeezus barely the victor over his friend's murderer, but still the victor. He fled to the palace to inform his friends. P.P.I. Bellerone went to locate his family, and he left promptly as his sister appeared to be missing. He followed his sense to the Pit and retrieved her moments later. Cassius went into the Pit and what happened down there is a mystery to all except between him, his sister, and whoever else he could have possibly met in the pit, including a one Chv8. King Eldritch addressed the potential issues of the Anti-Royalty Coalition and the Fibonacci Army storming his castle with an army of the peasants he riled up himself. He made extravagant preparations for the would-be battle and Squeezus and his Prince gathered by his side. The army breached the palace gates without incident. \n\nEldritch the 1st delivered the Anarchy Address, removing the monarchical criminal empire regime, and officially instating Anarchy as Quirktown's governing system. No system. The Reign is here, Qtowners. History is being made. And we are witness to something greater.\"\n\n**The Invisible Man** *DM*\n\n*The Iqar'an*\n\n*The Book of Coohammad*\n\n*\"My followers...

An apparition of his birth father appeared before him and steadied the hand. Discourse is evident even in the subjects of humour, but Iqar'as debates with civility.

Invisible to the eye, but Iqar'as found its form with his effortless shapeshifting. Lo, rallied the wings of Excelsior, lord of Pigeons, harbinger of plentiful scraps.

Kwirkton awaits its reckoning, but the Holy Three stave it off another day.\"\n\n**FINALE** *DM*\n\nThere is no such thing as a normal day in Quirktown. And the last two weeks have been no exception; things have been certainly different, however. The Reign came and left, forever rocking the foundations of Quirk Culture to its core. Let's examine their final adventure in the city-state once known as Quirktown.\n\nEldritch the Abomination, Cassius Bellerone, and Icarus Cervinus. Three young people embroiled in the largest political, social, economic, and violent upset in Quirktown history, surpassing all the regicides by an order of magnitude in the thousands. Let's be honest, regicide is old news in Quirktown. These three are known as The Reign for their quick rise to power and immense influence without any sort of official documentation save for the last few days they spent in our city. The 18 year old known as Cassius was dealing with an inner conflict of his own nature and the God he served. By all accounts, he should have been agreeable as Ded allowed him full freedom to do as he wished with his incredible power. Eldritch, the 23 year old Punkfolk pioneer, the anarchist turned King who turned our kingdom over to the people, a la anarchy. Icarus, the son of the elven Ambassador, who discovered he was prophesized to lead snakes into civilization, a primal messiah, an urban Druid. The Reign found itself at a loss for what to do next on their all encompassing crusade, right until they noticed Icarus's following making advances unto the Palace, led by a massive and empowered Astriel, Avatar of the Spirit of Population and previous Disciple of Icarus. The Reign parleyed with the snake army, learning that Astriel now went by Judasp, and he intended to take the Quirk Palace to locate the throne and bring his people to sentience with or without Icarus's help. After a strained but generally amicable conversation, Judasp relented his assault and decided to seek out Chivate instead. This plan later evolved into forming a dinner party with all the influentials of Quirktown (those that still yet lived) as a formal Last Supper of Quirktown to negotiate the snake's role in this new settlement forming from the ashes of all the previous customs of Quirktown. The Reign would be in attendance. \n\nCassius learned from the Order of the Broken Tusk that his deadly duel with Balrus had left a loose end of Balrus's faithful number two, Grurl, an ogre who spoke no common, and intended to kill him. They went to have a little chat about that. Breaking the barriers the language with the assistance of translating Orcs, Cassius earned the respect and pity of Grurl, and he resolved to not fight Cassius, and Grurl left him with the mysterious return of the concept of \"Dimensional Pressure Welding.\"\n\nThe Reign then spent a number of hours gathering material to perform a ritual to bless the watermain and vanquish all the undead roaming the the undercity at once and completely dick over the Necromancer they had a truce with.\n\nThe Reign made their way to the watermain underground in the exact center of the city. They met with thousands and thousands of snakes, Don Morbald, and Icarus's other two disposed Disciples, Imariel and Filuriel, who had also rejected their Elven names to take Pyther and Johncobra. Chivate was nowhere to be seen, yet, and the Reign settled in to eat. Pyther and Johncobra told Icarus how they located and invited Chivate, believing the peaceful resolution to be the right way, as Icarus had tried to teach them. Judasp had reluctantly acquiesced. \n\nChivate made his grand entrance. He implored that speaking was probably unnecessary and then should just fight. Eldritch was encased in a soundproof horse-bell, Cassius was smacked with a ball of pure trickster energy, and Icarus found himself accosted by Judasp. The final battle was on.\n\nEldritch quickly began attempting to escape the bell, finding that his sonic abilities served to hurt him just as much as they harmed him. Cassius attacked an evil Chivate he found (the trickster orb serving to turn all beings around him into Chivates), forgetting that even Chivate did not ping as evil and proceeded to beat the snot out of Gose Morbald as he ate. Icarus deftly avoided Judasps attacks, making headway toward Chivate. Judasp begged him, implying that this was the only way to ascend snake kind, and that it was the best thing for both of them. Discovering that the Chivate they fought was an illusion, Icarus trusted Judasp. Judasp injected him with a tranquilizing venom, putting Icarus into a intensely soporified state. Judasp explained that if he betrayed Icarus, Chivate would allow the snakes access to the throne. Icarus forgave him. Judasp despaired.\n\nUtilizing his wit and extemporaneous problem solving, Eldritch broke from his prison and located the real Chivate with the PanAmmer and AviDroid technology. He followed the signal to the access hatch to the watermain and found Chivate performing a similar ritual that they came to do. To fuck over the necromancer. They chatted about Priscilla and other things that happened until Cassius arrived. Chivate revealed that Raggoth and Chivate had both desired Cassius as their Paladin but Ded had siphoned the divine energy to power himself and leech Cass from true Paladinhood. He did this through Dimensional Pressure Welding refitted to attach to Divine universal forces. This confuses Cassius. He conferred with Ded and renounced the evil gnome as his deity. Ded pleaded with Cassius. Chivate wanted Cassius's blind and blundering style to use as a tool of chaos, and Raggoth wanted Cassius for his sheer power and dominance. Only Ded saw Cassius for what he was. He used him fully, for all things true of Cassius. And though Ded is evil, his intentions and plans were not. He simply needed the throne to empower his transdimensional magicks to reforge his destroyed universe. He begged Cassius. He asked him not as a God, but as a friend.\n\nIcarus switched forms, trying to find one large enough to accommodate the tranquil venom. His horse rocked unsteadily. Summoning a burst of true urban energy, he took the form of his friend Cassius, twelve feet tall, and unstoppable. He descended to face Chivate alongside his companions.\n\nIn one fell swoop, Cassius slashed at Chivate, foregoing his deity's hammer and protection, Eldritch trumped up his own attack to nearly slice Chivate in half, and Icarus moved in in his perfectly urban attuned form. Chivate died, defeated and vanquished in his mortal avatar form, just finishing the ritual in time.\n\nA skyscraping tower appeared before them. The Reign ascended the final steps of their journey. They found a room filled with paintings done by a familiar four-armed kobold. In the center of the room, a machine that dispensed Quirkenia stood. Trashpile revealed that Chivate used it to inflict Quirks on Quirktown from 750 feet in the air, blanketing the city in its curse. As the Reign took the Throne, Quirktown was no more. Quirkenia ceased to exist. The nature of the Throne changed. Cassius added to his already great power, though he had retired as a Paladin. He returned home to Westgate to continue fighting corruption, exploring freedom and his own powers, and trying to right all the wrongs of his family. Icarus uplifted Daedalus and Ouroborus to true deities, fusing them into one vessel for his primal spirit, the spirit of Icarus. He donned the feathered wings, and gave his primal energies to the snakes. He took flight and fell to the ground, to his death. Icarians benefited from every drop of blood Icarus sacrificed, becoming a true characterized race. Snakes grew three fingered and toed arms and legs. They sprouted antlers in homage to their messiah. The Urban Primal Spirit of Icarus continued to live on in all civilizations, but especially those of the Icarians. Eldritch took his power and continued to travel, toppling corrupt regimes left and right, opening his own Punkfolk bar called the Pig and Whistle and living for far longer than rockstar anarchists usually do. \n\nDed got his wish. He recreated his destroyed universe and left ours. He left a portal in the throneroom, but who knows what became of it once the Reign split.\n\nThe Reign knew no bounds when it came to change and though they started small, in the city-state of Quirktown, their influence and example of adventuring resounds in Litcheria to this day. This author has quite the hunch that though their greatest achievement has passed, defeating Chivate and relinquishing Quirktown from the tyranny of strange Gods, there is still much they will learn, and so much more they will do. Even if they don't know everything, like how Chivate actually performed a ritual to superpower the zombies. The 4-hour fight that eradicated the super zombies by the juiced up Cassius, Asgor, Eldritch, and Spirits of Civilization was great, but left Icarians in short supply. Oh well. This concludes this investigation of the events that led to the end of Quirktown.\n\nSigning off,\n-FPPI GH\n\n\n\n*This has been one of my favorite campaigns to date. It started off as simple introduction to a new system in a quasi-fairytale city setting and evolved into a dark tale of monarchial corruption, political manipulation, and the endless battle of chaos versus neutrality. Thank you for taking the time to read our story, if I knew my friend's reddit usernames, I'd tag them here. Until next time, I hope you enjoyed the Saga of Quirktown.*",

I wanted to go with them, but I swore to protect Grizzhunch. I went back to Grizzhunch’s place and pulled up a chair next to him. A short time later there was a knock on the door and two assassins were outside. One was named Creep and the other was some Tiefling Bard named….Thane?....Thenn?....Theren?....I was still under the effects of the potion so it’s a little fuzzy. I killed the Creep and the bard ran away. I tried to fight non-lethally but I was losing. I lost my temper and used my blade’s edge. A quick feint and the Creep’s throat was open. It should worry me that I’m bad at fighting but good at killing. I cut off the Creep’s head and stuck it on my rope staff, a warning to any other would-be-assassins. Grizzhunch went to bed and I waited for the dawn.\nThe next morning I collected the bounty for the Creep, ate some chicken and waffles with Grizzhunch, and met the rest of the group at the Rambling Gambler. We met our attorney there and Eldritch ended the potion’s effects on my mind. When I was fourteen I stole a bottle of my father’s liquor from his study and drank all of it. The potion felt similar to the liquor, and I wonder if that wizard just got me drunk.\nWe went to the trial and spun a wheel to determine what type of trial it would be. We had a blitz trial, which means we all just yelled at each other. I was able to make an opening statement that fell on deaf ears and then the mad scramble began. Lady Cat was able to summon Polonius’s ghost who confirmed that Chivate knew the advisor was in the cake and intended for her to be cooked alive. We won, but it was a hollow victory. Chivate took credit for everything and said Priscilla was clueless to all of it. He is going to the pit but I somehow don’t think that’s going to bother him that much. I think the pit will give him less trouble than it gave us. As for Priscilla, she gets to go home free. She is still the king’s advisor, still allowed in the city, and all the death she helped plan has been laid aside. She got away with it. That’s how justice works in Quirktown.\nAfter the trial, a group of halflings and kobolds started attacking Zillaheads. All the Quirktown residents had left the trial area and it was just us. We jumped in to defend the Zillaheads (actually, I couldn’t tell if Eldritch was fighting the Squeaks or the Zillaheads) and quickly dispatched the group of squeaks. We had two left alive by the end of the conflict. I questioned one and then gave him a choice: the pit or death. He chose death and I gave it to him. I stabbed him in the throat with a sword Colonius gave me, and Icarus did not like that, but I’m sick and tired of Quirktown’s justice system. I gave him a choice; he didn’t want the pit.\nIt’s difficult to know what to do now. The thing that brought us together is finished, and I don’t know our future. I was still angry throughout the day, so I went looking for some of the 150 criminals we set free. Eldritch accompanied me because I had to go to brothels, but he didn’t seem very interested in catching the killer I was hunting. I later heard something about a riot in the poor district and talks of anarchy so I think he was somewhere in there. As for me, I found a prostitute who called herself Queen. Turns out she was the one I was looking for. I took her and the brothel owner to the police station and collected their bounties. I also told the rest of the girls to let me know if anyone tried messing with them or taking advantage of them. I felt bad because the brothel owner was also the one responsible for protecting them. Let me be clear though, I am not a Pimp. I’m just making sure the girls don’t get fed to the wolves. Even if I don’t like their business doesn’t mean they deserve to be treated poorly.\n\nI also met my god, a strange gnome from a different reality, named Ded. He encouraged the me to seek the Throne of Quirktown so that he could truly become a god.\n\nThe party also encountered Jingles, the Murderclown during a celebration dinner with Madrion. He is the most prolific serial killer in Quirktown history.\n\n***EtA 1***\n\n*\"What a fuckin day. And what a way to start Cass's second act.*\n*Icarus has been doing this thing where he talks to snakes and he's somehow they're messiah. I'm not really sure of the specifics because he doesn't talk about it too much, but it sounds really cool.*\n*Cassius, on the other hand, finally met his god, who has seemed to be very absent. It's a little gnome called Ded. He shows up just to tell Cass that the throne of Quirktown can give people god-like powers and he wants Cass to claim it so Ded can, in turn, get some sort of god-on-god level of power. Sounds pretty fuckin cool to me.*\n*And then there's me. Thanks to Cassius's confusing search for a prostitute, I end up in the \"poor side of town\" which I hadn't yet seen. I thought Q-Town was too good to be true, and turns out I was right. They got people working in salt mines as slave labor. So I did what any responsible adult would do and sowed the seeds of revolution and let some poor people beat the piss out of a slum lord.*\n*All of this happened in one day! After our trial!*\n*And Cat, the unsung hero, is off studying more spells. Just cause she ain't doing nothing monumentous like everyone else doesn't mean she's not important. She's saved our asses a couple times. But she is, as previously stated, unsung.\"*\n\n[In The Works](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/in-the-works)\n\n***EtA 2***\n\n*\"This is actually from the same day as that good old gravehoppin adventure, which Cass wasn't with us for. He had taken a potion that made him so slow in the head, it was impossible to read his mind. He kept telling us his mind was \"like an infinite brick wall.\" I wanted to do a song about it at the time, but I couldn't quite make it work. So here we are a couple days later. This is a sort of throwback. In story, it would go right before \"Gravehoppin\"\"*\n\n[Infinite Brick Wall](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/infinite-brick-wall)\n\n***EtA 3***\n\n*\"This isn't so much a bard's tale as it is a battle song, though it does fit into the story of Cassius. He found out his \"god\" that he serves as paladin to isn't a god at all but just some gnome wizard from another dimension, and his name is Ded. He seemed to get pretty fired up about it, a little good and a little bad. I thought I'd keep that momentum rolling and try to pump him up, plus I once again thought I was being clever with the title.\"*\n\n[GOD'S DED](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/gods-ded)\n\n**Bloody, Mossy, Jingling, Necrotic Evil** *Eldritch the Abomination*\n\nI woke up next to a pretty girl and didn’t have to use the not-for-vomit barrel for vomit, but I did wake up yet again to the loud musical stylings of Cassius &amp; The Door yet again. Thankfully I wasn’t too hungover, since Cass dropped a grand on a big party last night. I spent it mostly snogging aforementioned girl in a maintenance closet and trying to get Ick to teach me how to talk to animals. As I’m kickin the girl out she lets it slip she’s an assistant to Prissy. Fannntastic. \n\nLittle bit of an up point, we got some chicken and waffles. Pretty damn good chicken and waffles at that. But then the local guard was telling us about how they were upset some of the people in the poor district killed their slumlord, you know the slum lord that the city pays to “keep the poor in check” and that pissed me off a bit. But they captured an aardvark so that was supposed to cheer me up? I’m not sure. \n\nThe real fun of the day was going to the local newspaper…hut? I don’t know what you call a news outlet. Maybe a news outlet. But we get there and who else is there but Prissy. And she’s surrounded by guys in hazmat suits. And the walls are covered in blood. And she’s got the photo of me pissing on Cat. She’s batshit crazy, but she comes through for me when I least expect it, without me even asking. I mean, she killed a kid, but there’s nothing I can do about that now, but Cass was pretty upset. He very audibly asked if he could kill her and ended up taking a hammer to the head from one of her cronies. \n\nAfter the bloody walls we go to the luscious green fields of… the city. It’s a mausoleum where we’re expecting to see that necromancer again. Except we have to fight a moss monster called an Agkai. And Jingles the Murder Clown decided to show back up. Well after a bit of battle, Jingles floats up and takes Cass and Ick with him, and they fall an almost comical distance as a net cocoon, and Cass gets launched across the way and slices right into the Agkai. Cat almost bites it, but holds on, ends up destroying the monster with Cass inside. One of the cooler battles I think I’ve seen. Then Ick makes a deal with the living moss that it will be nice to us (see: we must sound mental) if we don’t mean any ill will toward the necromancer or his underlings. And I still can’t talk to animals or plants. \n\nWell we waltz right on through a mausoleum full of undead and just go right up to the guy, who has forgotten his name. He says he wants the magical throne of Quirktown. Yeah, you and everyone else I know, bud. In between bouts of once again urging Cassius not to do anything stupid (when did I become the responsible one?) and NOT being taught how to communicate with the undead, he finally strikes a deal. We meet up at midnight, start of Sunday, and settle this like… I don’t know, the crazy people that we are. It’s been a proverbial rollercoaster of a day. And at the end of it I still can’t talk to anyone but people. \n\n\n***EtA 1***\n\n*\"So remember that pick that little creep snapped of me pissing on Horse Lady? Well I got it back. We went and talked to the guard as per usual for our little bounty hunting side business we've got going on. They said they heard screams from one of the newspaper's building and were told not to investigate. So naturally I go investigate because fuck the man. Well we walk in and Prissy's sitting there with my photo, a clean up crew, and the corpses of newspaper employees; and the walls are COVERED in blood. She's batshit crazy, and I can't say I wanted here to murder a bunch of innocent people, but she did it for me, and possibly saved my career in the process, so in a twisted sort of way, I'm thankful. So, fuck it, she earned herself a song. I don't know where I stand with her still. Sometimes she's evil, sometimes she's bending over backwards for me. It's never black and white with her. But I did do that thing again where I try to be clever. What's black and white, and red all over? A newspaper (especially if it's covered in the writer's blood. Then the riddle works two ways)\"*\n\n[Black &amp; White, And Red All Over](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/black-white-and-red-all-over)\n\n***EtA 2***\n\n*\"So after dealing with Prissy, we have to go to the moss district, because that's the other grave yard of Quirktown and we're expecting the Necromancer to come again. Well we get there and to fucking reason with some moss, of all things, and they have a protector. A beast known as the Agkai. Well we're going to town on it, and who else would show up but Jingles the Murder Clown. Again. Cass decides he's gonna take on the clown, and Ick turned into a net to help him (he can turn into objects now, too. It's weird but sort of cool). Well Jingles inflates and starts floating up and he takes net-Icarus and Cassius with him. They fall off and are plummeting down toward the ground when Icarus (still a net) catches an awning pole and trebuchets Cass across the whole court and straight into the Agkai, who has just about killed Cat. He cuts straight to the heart of the thing and kills it from the inside. Pretty bad ass.*\n*Then we have to go down into the mausoleum because the moss tells us he's there and that we can't hurt him or else it will hurt us with its mossiness. Sometimes I hate this town. We climb down ten levels and pass what felt like thousands of undead before we find the guy. He's so out of it he can't even remember his name. Cassius just about hit him, which would have sic'd the moss and innumerable zombies on us, so I had to stop him. He eventually struck a deal. No more raising the dead for the rest of the week, and at midnight start of Sunday he was going to meet us on the field of battle and give Cass one free hit. I just hope Ded's there for him when he needs it. I think Cassius is starting to go a bit mad. He worries me. That's three very different and equally dangerous descents for that poor guy in one day, and it felt like an unreasonably long day.\"*\n\n[The Descent](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/the-descent)\n\n**Icarus's First Anti-Christ and Playing with Balloons** *Lady Caistine*\n\nI think the only time I’ve ever been this tired and sore was when my mother signed me up for a full week of dance lessons. Everything ached and it was only just after 5 in the evening. Between our fight with Jingles, the Agkai, and meeting the necromancer again I was reaching the ends of my rope. And there was still magic to be done. \nIcarus and I wondered back towards the rambling gambler to find the druid (Ints Bugroot) that he promised to help. Eldirtch and Cassius went to see prince Grizzhunch, splitting up the party once again. At least this time I wouldn’t have to deal with awkward questions regarding me and any affections I held towards Icarus (I hoped!). \nWe went over the ritual we would be performing one more time. It should be a fairly simple process, though the goal was complex. It sickened me that Quirktown bound the innate powers of this druid and left him in the pit for almost a century. Really, almost everything about Quirktown rubbed me the wrong way.\nBut -back to the ritual here- we were simply going to take this Bugroot druid to an isolated location and combine our powers through an adaptor wand that Icarus had managed get and ease the druid back into his powers. We hoped that we would be prepared for anything if we did it slowly enough. \nInts Bugroot looked like he had spent a century inside a hole in the ground. He was tan, but his hair was wiry and greasy. The two of us decided that doing this back in the moss district would be the safest, just in case something went wrong (there were so many things that could go wrong too). \nWe were successful though! Nothing blew up in our faces and our magics, while very different, were able to combine thanks to the adaptor. Icarus flew with Bugroot (now a vulture. I’m not one for believing in signs, but that seems like a particularly ominous bird) outside the city while I waited for him in the area protected by his snakes.\nI pulled out my spellbook for study while I waited and worked peacefully until a man in a blindfold ran around the corner and began to stab me! It was one of the most physical fights I’ve been in, but I managed to knock him down to his back and knock him out. My magical wards helped protect me from most of the damage, but getting stabbed hurt! And was, quite frankly, rude. He didn’t even tell me why he was stabbing me.\nI bound him with rope in my bag and Icarus returned. We took him back to the guard station where officer Smeckler offered 800 gold coins for him. The assassin was Victor Sharpe an escapee from (yep, you guessed it) the pit. Smeckler also offered me a great insult before we went on our way. He didn’t even thank us for capturing yet another criminal!\nEldritch and Cassius suffered their own misfortunes checking in on Grizzhunch. First they were attacked by a clock-like man who stretched Cassius’ limbs out to an uncomfortable degree. Then Cassius Ded god gave him a vision of a black balloon that was going to attack the prince!\nEldritch told us that Cassius acted harshly towards the civilians while trying to save the prince. Even going so far as to threaten a balloon vendor, though Cassius said that he would never actually cut the man’s head off and drag it around in front of the children. Cassius and Eldritch had no idea that today was balloon day and were woefully unprepared for the attack by Hank Holliday.\nThe bard was able to convince everyone to release their balloons early, however, and then took advantage of the upper hand he dealt himself to attack the balloon sent by Holliday. Cassius ran inside the hospital to save the prince while Eldritch was causing his typical amount of chaos outside. Our paladin also managed to punch Boer Glover so hard he died. (Deeper thought on Cassius’ unusual strength and descent into anarchy and chaos needs to be had. Especially because he’s starting to make the team’s anarchist look quite tame.)\nWhen the two rejoined, with the prince safely in tow, the attack balloon sent by Hank Holliday was broken and hundreds of smaller, black balloons spilled out creating an atomic-static net and rolled towards them in a wave of death. \nIcarus and I caught up to them once the chaos settled. Cassius died and returned (though worse for wear) while protecting the prince. Several civilians lay dead on the ground. The charred bodies lending weight to Cassius and Eldritch’s retelling of their adventure. Cassius finds out that Grizzhunch’s secretary was much closer to the prince than was required and was, in fact, not a secretary at all. He seemed rather disheartened by this. I suppose that he had thought that their friendship was above all else? \nGrizzhunch informs us that he plans on taken the title of King of Quirktown and asks for our help. He explains some choices in faction alliances, though none seem very promising. He also tells us that no one has ever checked on the palace vault and that checks are written instead. We discuss his plan for a while and while he would certainly make a better king than his adoptive father, I’m not sure of his chances of pulling it off. We need to discuss this as a team and see which faction Grizzhunch aligns himself with.\nOur team (reunited at last!) head back to the guard’s office. I wait outside while the boys handle the bounties. The less time I have to spend with Smeckler, the better my mood will be. And it was still high despite all that had happened. We work well together and are steadily fixing the wrongs that we made. My mood could only be dragged down if I spent too long thinking about Jingles, or who hired Sharpe, or all the people that have died, or the necromancer, or-\nWell, anyway, other thoughts Cat, other thoughts. I shook my head and focused on my surroundings (it was moon-rise, after all. Quite a pretty sight in such a dreadful city). The boys finally came out and we divided the bounties amongst ourselves. We talked for a bit about what to do. Personally I wanted to spend some time studying my spell book. I felt exposed with my current spells. \nJust as we decided a course of action, Icarus turned into a bat and flew off chasing a swarm of locust. It appears that we made a mistake giving Bugroot’s powers back. I quickly filled Cassius and Eldritch in on our going on’s while they told me theirs as we walked to the library. Once there Daunches and I talk for a bit about Jingles. I found out some interesting information about him, and maybe that his weakness could be found in his god (Carnivous) or his nose.\nIcarus shows up some time later and his snake friends also appear. They talk amongst themselves and I absently pet one, before feeling embarrassed and awkward. They were probably having an important discussion (how rude of me!). I went back to browsing the books before suggesting to Icarus that perhaps I could help him a bit more today. I also noticed that the most fearsome snake was gone. Libraries were always places of power, though some smaller than others, and we could try to create another ritual to help the snakes learn. It goes well and the snakes leave looking at the ground with new eyes.\nThe druid we gave the powers back to now goes by Azi Dahaka and is another messiah for the snakes. An opposite, almost, of Icarus. He looked stressed and worried as he told me this information and I felt for him. He was only eighteen and expected to lead a whole species to sentience? A tough job for anyone, even if they’ve lived 100 years! \nVictor came back to attack me again. How on Earth did he get out of jail!? Not only that, how did he find me? I charmed him and he sat down with Icarus and myself. He conveyed that Smeckler was the one who hired him in the first place and released him to try again. Icarus wanted to act that instant, but my spell only works if I give no reason for him to doubt me. I’m placed in the awkward position of defending an enemy from a friend.\nIcarus managed to trap him and I smack Victor in the back of the head with my staff and cast a telepathic bond between Icarus and me. Hopefully I can convey my plan wasn’t to fight him, but to trap Victor tomorrow and get a confession in front of the captain of the guard. I doubt Victor will be so forthcoming with me now that I’ve attacked him.\nEldritch and Cassius had wondered off to check in on the brothel across the street from the Rambling Gambler. Apparently Cassius had become their protector somehow (another example of him descending into chaos?)\n\n***EtA 1***\n\n*Just when you think the day is over, Cass gets this vision from Ded that a ballon is going to attack a hospital with our friend detective/prince Grizzhunch in it. I swear we sound more insane every day. Well we get there, Cass saves Grizz from getting killed by a germaphobic assassin while I trick a crowd of people into releasing their balloons early (if that sentence doesn't sound mental...). Turns out it was Balloon Day in Quirktown, where everyone releases balloons into the sky for fuckin who knows why. Well the big bad ballon is courtesy of Hank Holliday, a criminal that only strikes on holidays in holiday related ways. the balloon pops and drops a bunch of smaller balloons that all build up static electricity and make a net of lightning, you know, to kill everyone. We make a run for it, but Cass has to carry Grizz and ends up tripping. He just about dies... well, he did for a second... protecting the prince, so I have to run back and save both of them. I don't normally write songs about my heroic exploits, but I'm not gonna lie about how badass I was in that moment. I go running into the net sword swinging like a madman. I get to Cass and Grizz and somehow I start swinging so fast the sword makes a whistling noise and that pops the balloons. So I switch to lute and throw out this gnarly solo I wish for the life of me I could remember. ended up popping every balloon on the premise and shattering a bunch of windows. Now, I know my profession is being a rock star, but in that moment I felt like a fucking ROCK STAR. I guess Ded and Death had a nice chat, because Cass snapped back to life sometime in the middle. But he wasn't the hero today. Nope. I was.*\n\n*(of course we would leave from there to check on his whores and the whorehouse was on fire and he saved all the prostitutes and punched a serial arsonist into oblivion, but I get to have my moments too)\"*\n\n[Riding The Big Black Wave Of Death](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/riding-the-big-black-wave-of-death)\n\n***EtA 2***\n\n*\"Ok, so as I previously mentioned, shortly after dying a little, Cassius had this big heroic moment (I mean, can I have one to myself please? Do you have to go and one-up me?) where he saved a bunch of harlots from a burning whorehouse. Previously he had killed the pimp and achieved de facto pimp status. He doesn't hang out there a lot, or tell them what to do or anything, but he's very protective of them, so he's basically their pimp. But he hates it when I (or the others) call them whores. He always wants to be gentlemanly and correct us, \"they're not whores; they're prostitutes\"*\n\n*Anyway, he was going to pop in and check on them, but the chicken coop was on fire. Some local serial arsonist named Sid Flaggs or something. Cass ran in to save the women trapped in there about to get a special hug from Sid--and not the sex kind, the burning alive kind. I played a little \"GOD'S DED\" to get him riled up for the fight. He ended up punching Sid so hard he flew through a wall and landed in the canal outside, dead. Well Cass still had to get the whores out so he shimmied em down somehow. I'm not really sure how, as I was busy playing his fight song and being amazed at how well it could work. Then he swings down through the burning facade, half on fire and completely unfazed by it. The building collapses and the rubbles rolls out just to my feet outside. And there's our tattered holy manager of a brothel being a Big Damn Hero for his whores... I mean Prostitutes*\n\n*I debated calling this \"Bordel Flambe\" (translates to \"Blazing Brothel\" or \"Flaming Whorehouse\" depending on who you ask) to try to tie back into \"Gateau Inferno\" but I thought that would be pushing it on making this whole story cohesive.*\"\n\n[They're Not Whores, They're Prostitutes](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/theyre-not-whores-theyre-prostitutes)\n\n**Death of a Clown** *Icarus Cervinus*\n\nSo, I flew from the library to the precinct, asking about Viktor Sharpe.  I was told to just kill him by the chief of the guard.  He instructed me to just kill Sharpe, and I obliged.  I didn't like it, but he's proven himself to be persistent and crafty.  In this climate, there's little trust to be had in the system to work as intended. \n\nCat and I went to the precinct together with the corpse of Sharpe.  The previous receptionist had been beaten and fired.  We took him to the hospital for treatment.  \n\nMeanwhile, Cassius and Eldritch are really going for this whole \"poor revolt\" thing, so I dunno where that's headed, especially with Balrus getting involved, but they did manage to somehow kill Jingles the Murder Clown with the assistance of a masked figure, Man Spider. \n\nWe all turned in for the night.  \n\nI awoke early, and helped some eagles defend their territory against some monkeys, and we performed a counter-raid.  Eagle wings and claws.  Check. \n\nToday is Stay Safe Inside Day, so to celebrate, we all will be moving through the aqueducts to kill some giant rats plaguing the snakes of the waterways. \n\nAlso, the chief is working for Quirkenmire, so, that may cause some issue.\n\n***EtA***\n\n*\"Pretty cut &amp; dry this one. Cass used his divine guidance to find Jingles. Found him in the hospital parking lot. I riled him up with some tunes and he destroyed that clown in 2 hits. Grizz was there as some twisted sort of man-spider, but I don't think he did horribly much, so I left him out. At this point it would have really been confusing to add him in cause I don't think he's been in any other tunes, plus I'd be introducing him as someone else and... I just said fuck it. Anyway, the clown's nose shot off and he deflated. Finally I can go to sleep. This has been the longest god damn Tuesday of my life.*\n\n*Jingles had this creepy circus music that would follow him around. I tried to capture some of that and throw in some of the ol' Eldritch. I'm not sure it worked quite well. I don't think this is one of my stronger songs musically from this adventure. But what are you doing as an artist if you aren't exploring?\"*\n\n[No More Funny Business](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/no-more-funny-business)\n\n**Surviving the Holidays** *Cassius Belleronne*\n\nI have to admit it; I was feeling pretty cocky after taking down Jingles the Murder Clown. I know I was only able to do it because Ded granted me immense strength for questing and Eldritch was singing straight adrenaline into my limbs, but Jingles went down with barely a scratch on me. I’m becoming more powerful and it feels good. I just killed the most prolific serial killer I have ever heard of, a guy who has twice escaped us, and I feel so much power rushing through me that it feels like nothing can stop me or harm me. Then today happens.\nSo, as you probably know, it’s the Stay Safe and Inside Holiday in Quirktown. It means that everyone locks their doors and doesn’t do crap for 24 hours. Seems boring to me, but Quirktown is a strange place. The group and I decide to ignore the holiday’s observances partly because we know Holiday Hank is after Eldritch and partly because Icarus wants us to go kill giant rats in the sewers (something about them hurting his snake worshippers). At the start it seems like it’s going to be a pretty boring day. It’s not like Hank can do anything dangerous with staying safe and inside your house and I’m confident in the group’s ability to take on some dog sized rats. But that’s okay, I’m tired after finishing my quest to slay Jingles (just because I don’t need sustenance or sleep during a quest doesn’t mean my body doesn’t come for some payback after one) so I think I can do with a relatively boring day.\nOutside the Rambling Gambler we buy some doorknobs from the Halfling salesmen to help protect our various houses and rooms. I know we really don’t have any of those yet but these guys made a lot of sense at the time, and I know I want to eventually open up a dojo/boarding school for gifted youngsters. I also see Cat (not the group’s Cat, my prostitute Cat) in front of the brothel starting on the repairs so I buy state-of-the-art doorknobs for the new building and give them to her. She also tried to pay me again (I keep telling her I’m not her boss, just her friend), but she let me give the money to one of the girls who’s fallen on hard times and will be out of work for a time.\nAfter our purchases we move into the sewers and take on some giant rats. We find the nest quickly enough (in waist-deep water below a catwalk), kill all the giant rats, and take the guy who’s making them (Mumbling Dave) as a prisoner. Oh, I should also mention that there’s this wolf following us around. I think he belongs to Eldritch but no one’s really explained it to me. \nWhen we get back to the sewer entrance we are attacked by this woman who I assume is Mumbling Dave’s lover. She has this impenetrable armor and none of our attacks seem to do any harm to her. On top of the invincible woman problem there are explosions occurring throughout the city. Finally, in an act of more desperation then I’d like to admit I take mumbling Dave as a hostage and threaten his life unless she ceases to attack us. I would never have backed up the threat but she doesn’t know that. She stops but we seemed to reach an impasse when Icarus ties his (tail? rope? I don’t know) around her leg and shoots off into the air. He drops her about a hundred feet and lets her plummet to the earth. It was kind of messed up (and badass). It killed her so we took some of her armor and Mumbling Dave into the city center.\nThis day was supposed to be easy. When we got to the Rambling Gambler we saw it in ruins. It looks as if an explosive went off inside of the building. I don’t know that anyone survived. As my group and I surveyed the scene we found the body of Prince Grizzhunch, dead. I lost it a little bit. I couldn’t stop weeping and crying. I was useless and helpless and no help at all to my team. For all the power I thought I possessed, for all my cockiness, Grizzhunch was killed while I was off fighting rats and there wasn’t a thing I could do about it. Power shouldn’t work like that. I should be able to protect as well as I can kill. My friend was gone and I felt disheartened.\nUltimately, it was Icarus who snapped me out of it. He told me there was a time to mourn and a time for action. I began putting on my armor and vowed to avenge Grizzhunch. The group and I went over everything we could discover from the Rambling Gambler’s wreckage. We know it was Holiday Dave who seemed to be working with the Squeaks and Balrus, the attack wasn’t meant to kill us but only get our attention, and it seems that the explosions were practical in their placement to targets. We all suspected that places and people important to us were all targets of the explosions.\nIcarus left to go check on his snakes’ haven and I went looking for Cat and the girls. Meanwhile, our Cat and Eldritch were going to use some of the doorknobs (which were the explosives by the way…stupid, crafty, Halfling salesmen) to track Holiday Hank. On my way to the precinct to drop off our bounties Ded appeared to me to talk about my new quest. He granted me the boons I requested on the condition I avenge Grizzhunch by following the Prince’s example, no killing and a fair trial. This did not sit well with me. I wanted blood and revenge. I thought that if anyone deserved death it was Holiday Hank and Balrus. They killed over a hundred people today, surely that means their lives are forfeit. But Ded insisted and I know it’s what Grizzhunch would have wanted. I’m starting to think my death toll is getting too high. I don’t think I was wrong in any of the lives I’ve taken (except maybe those Squeaks I killed after the trial), and I know Ded is okay with me killing those who hurt and kill, but I question what it’s doing to me. Does the taking of life taint the soul even if the life taken was deserving of its fate? Eldritch would have some pithy comment if I asked him, but I don’t think I have the wisdom for such answers. \nI dropped off the bounties at the precinct and went to the poor district to find Cat and the girls. Trashpile helped me locate them and I was happy to find them safe and helped them remove their doorknobs (which had yet to explode, thankfully). I told Cat about Holiday Hank and Balrus and told her I expected her and the girls to become targets in the upcoming war. They are the only ones in this city who I know and care about (apart from my own group) and I won’t put it past Balrus to use them against me. I gave Cat 10,000 goild, the money I was saving for my institute, and told her to use it to get her and the girls to safety. I don’t know if she’ll ever understand why it is I help them, or how much I care about them, but that’s okay as long as their safe. She said she would get with Trashpile and disappear. After that I went back to the Rambling Gambler’s ruins to prepare for my war against Balrus.\nSo, here’s what I’ve learned happened with everyone else. Cat and Eldritch managed to track Holiday Hank to an empty warehouse and took him by surprise. He told them more bombs were going to go off later (really glad I removed those doorknobs from Cat’s house) and that there was nothing to stop the detonations. Eldritch through the doorknobs he had on him into Hank’s lap and booked it out of the warehouse. They didn’t make it very far away from Hank when the doorknobs, and the warehouse, blew up and launched them into the air. They managed to hit water but apparently Cat died very briefly and made some deal with death about 100 souls. Well, after they got out of the water and killed a couple of Squeaks they headed back to the Rambling Gambler’s ruins.\nAs for Icarus it gets kind of weird. His snakes were injured to some extent but there are some still alive. The real problem, apparently, is that the other Druid’s followers have taken the city as their territory. Icarus has kind of declared war on the other druid and his followers but also hasn’t. I’m still a little confused on that and I don’t think he fully knows what he wants. Anyways, to prepare for all the horrible crap and wars happening in the city Icarus gathers up his mini-druid garden snakes and tries to give them a power boost. He does this ritual that sounds both very beautiful and very costly to imbue them with some druidic powers. He gives up his gold, his stored energy, and cuts off his own wings with his spearhead, and gives them as sacrifices to the urban spirits. Then, he names and grants his new super-empowered snake disciples with blessings to help them prosper. It sounds very interesting to hear him talk about it but I wonder if he can live with the cost. He was passed out in front of the Gambler’s former doorway with huge wounds in his back. He’s lost his ability to fly and his snakes have been drastically altered. Not to mention that war tends to breed the worst of civilization. I hope he knows what he’s doing. \nNow, we sleep at the Rambling Gambler’s burnt remains and prepare for the battles to come. Things have never looked bleaker for us, but I think we’ve grown together in our short week. I think we’re starting to finally act like a team and our last split up has made us realize how much we need each other, if for no reason other than the immense power our enemies wield. I take the vigil tonight and look forward to the battle tomorrow.\n\nOh, I should probably mention this for nothing other than the sake of posterity. Stella, Grizzhunch’s whatever, also died. There, I recorded it.\n\n***EtA***\n\n*\"It was one of those days where you wake up and you think it's gonna be a good day. I got a full night's rest. We had just stopped Jingles. It was Stay Inside and Stay Safe Day in Quirktown. Our I got a hot meal and my only indication of what to do today was to clear the sewers of some rats. I got a pet wolf (old friend, long story, also I can talk to animals now). Everything up until we were leaving the sewer seemed like today could be a good day.*\n\n*And then it didn't at all.*\n\n*Some wacko stopped us at the exit. My lute wasn't working. Explosions started happening. Some halflings had been selling doorknobs all day (I bought a few in my high spirits) that turned out to be explosives on behalf of Hank Holliday. The Rambling Gambler, the closest thing I've had to a home in years, was leveled. Grizz and Stella were dead in the rubble. What's a day in Quirktown without death of someone close to you? Rhetorical questions because it doesn't exist.*\n\n*Cass took off to Ded knows where--probably to see his whores.\nIck ran off without a word--most likely snake business.\nCat tried to disenchant a doorknob to track it back to Hank. \nAnd I was the only one bothered to even try to give our friend... one of the only fuckin sane people in this fucked up place, a proper send off.*\n\n*Well we found the halflings and I went a bit psycho on them. Tied one up and took him to the warehouse we tracked the magic to. Stuffed a doorknob in his mouth and left him tied up outside. Hank was in there. He said it was too late to stop him so I just tied him up and left the rest of the explosive housewares in his lap. Me and Cat and Asgar (my wolf, sorry I failed to mention that) couldn't get out before it exploded. We go sailing through the air and manage to land in some water. But Cat's a little dead. Then some fuck up kobolds and halflings show up. I barely manage to fend em off, cause I'm pretty shabby too at this point. Asgar goes down and now two of my friends are just dead in front of me. Again.*\n\n*Asgar made it back, and Cat made it back after having to make a deal with death. But I was done. No bounty reward for Hank. No loot. Just going back to my wrecked home, crawling into the rubble and going to sleep.*\n\n*This is a song in four parts. The intro/overture is to serve as the motif of the piece. A death march.*\n\n*The first verse is the death of Grizz and the reaction of our group.*\n\n*The second verse is the path of revenge on Hank.*\n\n*The closing is a return to the overture but acting as a third verse, as revenge brought more death, eating me alive as the circle keeps eating itself.*\n\n*This is the \"second untying\" (deuxieme denouement). This is the close of the second act. I don't even know if this is the epic of Cassius anymore, because he's all but abandoned everything he used to care about.\"*\n\n[Death's Doorknob (Deuxième Dénouement)](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/deaths-doorknob-deuxieme-denouement)",

He returned with his own warm grin. It was endearing, yet I hated how easily he could smile amidst everything that was happening. Clearly immune to the existential crisis I was enduring.\n\n“Well, I know I mentioned I may not have a way of paying you all who took this job on, but I do have something I’d like to give you,” Bordel went on. He then handed me a strip of leather. It was made into a loop with a knot at the top. Actually the knot was more or less a series of loops because there was no start or finish. No tied ends. I marvelled at the simplicity wondering how he had accomplished it. I then realized I hadn’t said anything as I gazed at the gift.\n\n”Thank you,” I responded. I felt more genuine in my smile, though my eyes couldn’t bare to look upon my boss. I couldn’t decided whether it was embarrassment or shame that went through my mind from how I acted earlier. He was more patient than anyone ought to be with me and there he was giving me a token of friendship- or appreciation?\n\nI rotated the bracelet in my hand, not sure what else to say.\n\n“It’s a called an eternity knot. Something from my home,” Bordel explained.\n\n“How fitting all things considered,” I replied, my cheeks buzzing with warmth. We as Primordials, we were eternal.\n\n“I really do appreciate you being here helping with all of this,” Bordel added. I forced my lips to maintain their grin. The man then sighed and added, “Believe me, I wish not to do this task.”\n\nMy smile faded as I returned my gaze. Did he have his doubts? Did Bordel want to go home and forget about all of this? I almost got to my feet to grab his shoulders, but remained sitting as I asked, “Then why not? We don’t need to do this. We can go home together!” I was earnest though I had no home to return to. However anywhere away from the horrors of recent would be a refuge.\n\nBordel’s eyes fixed upon me. There was longing and there was wisdom beyond my own that bore into mine.\n\n“It’s not about what I want to do. It’s about doing what’s right.”\n\nLike the strings on my lyre, or a the crisp chime of a bell in the morning hours, the words rang in my mind. My heart sank as I realized he wasn’t about to abandon the task of the cups and take me to safety, but how right he was to do so. Bordel was a good man but my disappointment stung. I looked down to the bracelet long and hard, but couldn’t deny the truth in doing what was right.\n\n“Malaney,” he called to me. I looked up into his caring face, “I hope that you also understand that I’m not your boss. I never was and wouldn’t want you to think of me as such.” My lips betrayed me and smirked. He may not have seen himself as my boss, but Bordel was the leader.\n\n“Fine then. I suppose Heqet Aj will have to do,” I informed him. Bordel pondered a moment and gave a nod, asking, “what does it mean?”\n\nI beamed in spite of myself. “It literally translates to ‘the Boss.’” We both chuckled and I quickly added, “But it’s more of respect. You are my elder and I revere your leadership.”\n\n“I think I can work with that,” Bordel replied. He then dismissed himself. As he stood up and left, I realized I hadn’t put the bracelet on yet. With a smooth motion of my hand, I secured the eternity knot around my left wrist.\n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻",

        "text": "Hello again! This is a continuation of 'What we are in the Shadows Part 6 (All the Angles), which you can find here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/49blvc/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_6_all/. Last time, this particular band of misfits had acquired evidence of an A.L.E IT specialist's tryst with a married priest and used that to blackmail her into performing a favor for their employers at a later date. Riding high off of their victories, the newbie runners returned to their dwelling and celebrated this latest triumph. That is where we find ourselves at the moment. \n\nSeveral days passed in a blur of training and revelry. Finally, this rag-tag group of runaways had united into something resembling a functional team. Hautangi was as charming as ever but his new found friends had developed something of a tolerance to his irritating behavior. Poindexter was more confident and relaxed around the others, his typical anxiety almost entirely absent. Nellie was more comfortable with the others and looked at the boys with the same kind of respect that she gave Leilani. The veterinarian was angry for long periods of time but her moments of calm revealed an affection for this motley assortment of idiots. \n\nThings were looking up for our team: Hautangi was getting a hold on his magic, Leilani was teaching everyone to use a gun and Benjamin had never been in better shape. It was at this time, of course, that Ghost reappeared with bad news. The cryptic mercenary arrived without comment; Nellie the first to realize that he was sitting at their rickety plastic table. \n\n\"Ghost?\" The former corporate event planner asked hesitantly. \"What's wrong?\" Even with the wide-brim of his hat pulled down across face face, Nellie could see a look of consternation across Ghost's features. The others made their way over, arraying themselves around their erstwhile mentor. Ghost gestured for them to take a seat, brows furrowed. Once the team's collective posterior was firmly planted, the shadowrunner spoke. \n\n\"Got your next job. Information you need is on this data chip.\" His words were clipped, his tone brusque. Ghost reached into the folds of his coat and retrieved a scrap of paper. \"Write your wish-list on this.\" Placing it on the table, he stood and stalked back towards the entrance. Leilani glared at his retreating form, a familiar rage smoldering in her heart.\n\n\"Where the fuck are you going!?\" Her words came in a heated growl. Ghost paused at the threshold, a hand clenched against the wooden door. He could feel the eyes of the group on him but refused to turn around. The gun-for-hire sighed before speaking. \n\n\"I'll come collect your list tomorrow. Just...read through the files and make your plan.\" There was a hint of remorse in his voice but it was tempered with resolve. Ghost slipped outside and closed the barn door behind him. The farmhouse was silent as the team watched him leave until Hautangi spoke up with his customary candidness.\n\n\"Did Ghost just fuck off? Is that what just happened? I feel like that's what just happened.\" The hustler looked between his friends questioningly. Poindexter shrunk in on himself, Nellie seemed apprehensive and Leilani...Leilani was pissed. \n\n\"What the fuck is happening!? Where the fuck does he think he's going!? God damn it, Ghost! Stop being an asshole!\" She roared and pounded her hands on the table, shaking the cheap surface violently. Nellie sighed and picked up the tiny chip off of the table, plugging it into the trid projector. Hautangi squawked in pain as Leilani grabbed him by the ear and dragged him over to the make-shift sparring ring. Poindexter glanced over at the beating before turning back to the holographic display. Information appeared in a flash of emerald light, accompanied by the sounds of pain and pleas for mercy. Nellie skimmed across the dossier provided, her features schooled into an impressively impassive facade. She had finished by the time Poindexter was reading the second paragraph, leaning back with a thoughtful hum. \n\n\"This is going to be tricky.\" Nellie spoke almost too calmly, her words overly enunciated. She put a hand on Ben's arm and smiled. \"We have been tasked with retrieving a vehicle. There will be a single man driving; his fate is ours to decide. The vehicle itself, a modified sedan, must not suffer any more than superficial damage. We have the delivery route and the timetable for our driver.\" The event planner grinned with a decidedly wicked slant, her face dark. \"The driver is a 'professional'. I suspect that means our target is a shadow-runner. How interesting...\" Nellie's voice trailed off as Poindexter finished reading. Her flabby friend rubbed the back of his head uneasily and cleared his throat. \n\n\"Uh...So we have to kill a runner? Like, a real runner?\" Benjamin laughed nervously after he spoke. \"Yeah, I don't like the sound of that.\" Nellie inclined her head to one side, still looking analytically at the information shimmering before her. \n\n\"I doubt that we will need to kill him. I suspect that neutralizing him would be preferable. We should avoid killing anyone that we do not need to.\" Her voice was completely steady, as if she was speaking about the weather instead of ending a life. Poindexter stared at her, worry painted across his face. Whatever his internal monologue may have been, the taxi driver decided against vocalizing it in that moment. Oblivious to her friend's apprehension, Nellie continued her one-sided conversation. \"Killing him would likely be difficult. With a name like 'Tank', I doubt that he would be easy pickings.\" Her grin stretched to almost super-villainous proportions as plans began to filter through her mind, the details falling into place. Nellie twisted backwards, calling out to her fighting fellows. \"That is enough! Leilani, he has had enough. Come over here. We have work to do.\" \n\nOne week later, a muted blue sedan lazily drove down a narrow mountain road. It's driver reclined backwards in his chair, enjoying the cool flow of air of the air conditioning. The large ork had one hand resting on the wheel, his eyes focused on the empty road in front of him. Tank was an exceptionally large individual, his frame swollen with muscle, and he was constantly shifting in the leather seat. He had seen very few people on this particularly warm day and that suited him just fine; less traffic meant an easier mission. Sharp senses detected the sound of a motor roaring behind him and a quick glance at the rear view mirror identified the source: A single motorcyclist gaining quickly. While he could not determine the gender, Tank had seen enough specimens of all meta-humanity to tell when someone was fat. He grinned as the rider closed distance between them, synthetic fibers tightening in his arms as the shadowrunner prepared for trouble. \n\nAs his vehicle rounded a troublesomely obscured corner, Tank was forced to a sudden stop. The car squealed beneath him as he forced his vehicle away from scrapping across the guard rail. Grunting in annoyance, the mercenary glared out the windshield. A construction worker hadparked in middle of the road, blocking the already cramped path with their tarp-covered truck. Bright orange cones stood stalwart across the ground as a large, tattooed man growled at a scantily clad hitchhiker. The beautiful young woman was clearly trying to persuade him into giving her a ride but the big Maori shot her down resolutely. Tank was a consummate professional but his interest was piqued. Keeping an eye on the motor cycle as it pulled up behind him, he rolled down the window and bellowed out.\n\n\"Excuse me! Mind if I ask what's going on?\" His voice carried over to the bickering duo. The worker growled, brushing some detritus off of his high-visibility vest and flipped Tank the bird. His arguing partner scoffed in disgust before turning to the car. She trotted over, smiling brightly, and leaned against the window sill. Offering a tantalizing view, the woman quirked an eyebrow. \n\n\"Hey there handsome. Mind if I catch a ride?\" Her voice was like honey on his ears and he smiled back at her as a pleasing scent hit Tank. \n\n\"Cinnamon, huh? Love the perfume. Sorry, love, but I'm on business.\" She pouted at his response, leaning further towards him. It was with a low purr that she tried her luck once more.\n\n\"Aww, come on. Sure there's nothing I can do to change your mind?\" Tank grinned winningly at her, enjoying the sight.\n\n\"You're gonna want to move away from the door.\" Nellie blinked in confusion at his answer. It must have showed on her face because he chuckled. \n\n\"What do you mean?\" Tank gently removed her arms from the windowsill and winked. \n\n\"You really want to back away right now. Good try though.\" His words held an under-current of good humor with just a touch of warning beneath the surface. Nellie back-pedaled quickly as the bike rider appeared at the window with a pistol. Tank rolled his eyes with a grumble, casually knocking the weapon from Poindexter's grip. Under his helmet, the cab driver was sweating profusely as he was effortlessly disarmed. \"That was fucking terrible. Sorry about this.\" Tank leveled his own gun at his assailant and pulled the trigger. A single, long dart erupted from the barrel and slid through Ben's motorcycle leathers without resistance. He gave a choked cry and collapsed into a quivering pile. Nellie swore and lunged for him as she screamed.\n\n\"Plan B!\" Hautangi ripped the tarpaulin from their borrowed flat-bed truck and threw it to the side. With the dirty tan cloth removed, Leilani was revealed: Laying prone in the tray and glaring down the scope of her rifle as she sighted Tank. There was a sharp crack as her weapon fired once and then twice, punching through the windshield. Tank took both shots without slowing, the rounds barely penetrating his heavily augmented skin. The shadow-runner made to slam the driver's door into Nellie, twisting to the side to deliver a cybernetically enhanced kick to the aluminum frame. It was at this moment that Fate decided to throw us a bone. Instead of crushing the 'hitch-hiker' with his door, the servo-motors in Tank's legs fired at full force. The result? He flew out of the passenger's door and over the guard rail, a look of complete shock on his face. \n\nAs Tank vanished from sight, Leilani looked up from her scope in confusion. Once she confirmed that yes, that had indeed happened, the bi-cardiac threw the rifle to the side and roared at Hautangi. \n\n\"Fat Man's down! Get him in the truck!\" She leaped down from the tray and sprinted over to the twitching man and his struggling assistant. \"Get in the car!\" Nellie nodded, sliding into the now vacant driver's seat with frenzied motions. Leilani wrapped one of Poindexter's arms around her shoulder and hauled him up with drawn out groan of exertion. Hautangi slid to a stop beside them, grabbing Ben's other arm and dragging him back to the truck. They threw him into the cab and Leilani rolled in alongside him. She pounded on the cab once before holding her comatose friend in place. \"Go, go, go!\" The truck sped away, almost throwing it's unsecured passengers free. The sedan squealed up behind it and the two vehicles drove away into the sunset. Nellie was already putting in a call to Ghost with their one-shot comm-link.\n\nTheir return to the barn was heralded by a howl of engines and the scent of burnt rubber. Ghost rushed to meet them as they carted the unconscious form of Poindexter inside, accompanied by a smartly dressed man\n\n\"Remove his jacket, I need to see the contact site.\" The man spoke with an authority that brokered no argument, forcing the group into action. As Hautangi and Nellie worked their insensate teammate out of his leathers, Leilani spoke with the doctor.\n\n\"I've checked his vitals. The dart must have had some kind of neuro-toxin because I can't think of anything else that would be causing this.\" He listened to her, preparing a medical scanner for use. The doctor gave Leilani an approving nod before shushing her and initiating the scan. The device emitted a bright blue light for moments, pulsing across Poindexter's unconscious form. There was an almost comical 'ding' as the scanner completed it's task. Reading over the results, the doctor hummed thoughtfully before speaking.\n\n\"I would not have expected any of you to correctly diagnose him. It is not a neuro-toxin. His body is being forcibly altered by a concentrated dosage of nanites.\" Hautangi stared uncomprehendingly while Nellie went slack-jawed. Leilani growled, running a hand through her hair in frustration. \n\n\"Why would Tank dose him with nanites? Shit. Is he going to be okay?\" The doctor frowned, packing away his tools.\n\n\"I do not know. If the nanites have a malevolent purpose, it will come to fruition. There is nothing that I can do to change that.\" Packing away the scanner into his bag, the doctor nodded towards Ghost. \"My usual fee. Your employers will handle it?\" The mercenary inclined his head in agreement. Without any further niceties, the doctor took his leave. Ghost and the team stood around Poindexter, staring at the glowing orange lines that marked his veins. Leilani paced angrily while Hautangi shook his head. Nellie slid onto a bar stool and sighed. Ghost scanned the exhausted group and sighed irately to himself.\n\n\"Told you the good times were over.\"\n",

        "text": "A little background on this campaign:\nThe party consisted of three friends from college I played with back in the day and another player I knew from a previous Roll20 campaign. I was DM. This was my first time trying out Dungeon World and I think we all had a blast.\n\nIn Dungeon World, XP is tracked mainly by tally marks, or 1xp at a time; as incentive to involve themselves in reflection and character contribution, I offered extra xp if the players volunteered to do a \"Session Write-Up,\" basically a summary of the events that happened in the session as told from the perspective of a character. \n\nI present to you the story of Quirktown, uncut and unedited from the mouths of the characters themselves (with a few write ups done by myself, especially the last few) \n\nFor the first two acts, our party Bard produced real music telling the story of the party accompanied by his own version of the events. The songs will be linked for your listening pleasure.\n\n**Session 1: Fire Dancing** *DM*\n\nOur story begins with four intrepid heroes of no small consequence arriving just in time to Quirktown's annual Quirkfest to halt a rowdy group of Zillaheads, fans of Priscilla Zora, aka Priszilla. These four are none other than elven ambassador heir Icarus Cervinus, son of councilman Bellerone, Cassius Bellerone, rising punkfolk legend and rockstar, Lucien Dredge, aka Eldritch the Abomination, and daughter of the prestigious Pegason of Pegason Horse fame, Lady Caistine Carerris Janlynn Daratris Loranda Loraonna Pegason.\n\nBeing thanked by captain of the guard assigned to the festival's security detail, Captain Dangor, the crew set upon entering the city through its many waterways, assisted by Pinchouli the Morbid Gondolier. As they would come to find out, every resident of Quirktown had a telling Quirk, and Pinchouli's was a penchant for macabre songs as he rowed passengers throughout the city.\n\nChecking out the sweet bazaar brimming with Genuine Wiabu artifacts and other jokes, the party is greeted by the king of Quirktown himself, King Quirkenmire. Banter about and receive quest. The team is tasked with assisting the king's favored cook, Madrion, whose quirk is to be very forgetful. Many people have quit (and died) in this endeavor, but the party readily accepts the work.\n\nEncountering a belligerent kobold with four hands, they manage to swindle their way past his belligerent quirks and convince him to turn over a new leaf and they turn over a new bridge. \n\nAssisting Madrion became host to a slew of problems, such as locating the kitchen, which was not a restaurant, fighting soup that Madrion forgot to kill, chopping nonexistent vegetables, cooking a bunch of meat in a giant oven, and rescuing a bunch of eggs from screaming parrots. Madrion then set to making a cake and returned instantly with a made cake that simply needed to be baked. So, Cassius and Icarus did so, simply.\n\nThe feast was well underway and the performing members of the party were well-received. Priszilla also caused her usual ruckus. Then came the time for the SURPRISE CAKE DANCE FOR KING QUIRKENMIRE BECAUSE IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY.\n\nBut the surprise was a cooked sexy advisor named Elanor. And now the party must hunt the greatest chef in the world, who is very forgetful. Godspeed.\n\n***S1: Eldritch the Abomination***\n\n*\"Alright so I roll into Quirktown for Quirkfest '35 and these zillaheads are causin a fuckin fuss (what's new there). And not a productive fuss either. It's some pussyfootin about, these little twats whining about it being crowded. It's a fuckin festival, you entitled donkey stool. Anyway so I knock a few of em out, and these three randos are there and they knock a few out and before you know it, the king's tellin us that we stopped some serious mayhem. I just like smackin 'round ole prissy's fans.\nAnyway, he takes us in, says some shit in his high-pitched midgetary vocal chords, and tells us he needs us to help his royal cook (who has memory problems, mind you) prepare the meal for the feast that night, and when we're done we get to be honored guests at dinner. Mostly I'm just ready to get away from the zillaheads that're about.\nSo we get to the kitchen--me, a guy with antlers, this giddy little horse breeder, and a paladin named Cassius. We do whatever Matreon, the forgetful chef tells us and we're out in no time and with only one person in the party close to dying. Not bad, eh? All we had to do was kill a soup, chop imaginary vegetables, and turn on an oven full of exotic meats. Last thing we got to do is put a big ol' cake in the oven...except it's already made. Just assuming Matreon knows what he's talking about, Cassius follows his instructions and puts it in the oven and we're done.\nThe show goes great, I do my thing, rock out. Horse lady does her magic, it goes over alright. Priszilla also does my thing and I drink to forget it. Not quite sure why I opened for her, but I guess money talks.\nAnyway, they roll out that cake from earlier, only now it's lookin like its burnt to a crisp. Some priest tells horse lady (she has a name, it's just stupid long) that the king's \"advisor\" (some twat he's slammin on the side) is scheduled to do a dance. Also she's supposed to jump out of a large cake. Also she sometimes falls asleep for hours at a time and is impossible to wake up.\nImagine my face when everything clicks. Now add laughter.\nAnd of all people, it was Cassius that killed her. Bloke's a paladin, trying to be all morally righteous, and he killed the king's floozie! I mean, he didn't do it on purpose, but that makes it even funnier! What a day. Oh, and then we narrowly avoided getting arrested for aforementioned manslaughter.\nAnyway, this song basically recounts all that. The shouting \"Eleanor!\" in the chorus is sort of a play to the idea of trying to wake her up. I don't go into too much detail about how it was actually an accident that Cass killed the poor girl because I thought it would take away from the tragedy and turn it into a more apologist piece, and I'm not about that. Anyone who's ever heard me play before knows I don't beat around harsh realities.\"*\n\n[Gateau Inferno](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/gateau-inferno)\n\n**S2: Twists and Turns** *Icarus Cervinus*\n\nAfter conversing with some of the local pigeons, I took off to Madrion's kitchen, looking for a scent to track him with.  I found his email parrot and an old knife of his.  Upon returning to my companions, I saw them being attacked by a group of drunk guys with pipes.  I interceded, and along with my allies, we subdued them, though a few of them died. They seemed to be particularly interested in Eldritch, and Cat was beat up pretty badly.  We gave them no burial or last rites.  Perhaps I'll keep this new set of antlers as a reminder of the violent nature of this strange city. \n\nWe followed the scent of Madrion, a mechanical parrot's recordings, as well as Cassius's strange sense of direction to a farm outside the city limits, owned by Madrion's cousin, Tyrion.  Cassius's faith seems to be failing him.  I'm still not sure what god he follows.  I'm not sure he does either.  \n\nAlong the way, I rebuilt a home for a nest of snakes, learning of their lives and temperaments.  I was eager to learn a new animal form.  I hadn't seen any new animals in over three years.  \n\nAt the farm, things were.. tense.  Madrion was terrified of returning to Quirktown, fearing his impending execution.  His cousin, Tyrion, was only too eager to provide sanctuary to Madrion.  We talked over further details of events leading up to the death of Elanor and began to suspect foul play on part of Priscilla Zora.  We dined with the two orcs and, at the urging of Cassius, returned to Quirktown to find Polonius, the security hire we'd met the day before.\n\nWe arrived just as he was attacked, and through the chaos of battle, Polonius died. Cassius seems particularly upset by this.  He's not having an easy time of things lately.  I suspect his god is testing him.\n\nTo make things worse, a hunchback man claiming to be the prince stumbled upon the aftermath of the battle, deducing that the four of us were Polonius' killers, despite Trashpile's testimony.  In all fairness, I think we may have played a greater part in his death than I'm comfortable with.  Though we tried to help, the antler wounds in Polonius' body tell a different story.  The three people who attacked him in the alley had these incendiary pills in their mouths, so there wasn't even any evidence of any other party's involvement.  I'm certain something more is at work here.\n\nThe hunchbacked prince is arresting us, and I think we've caused enough trouble in this city without making a fuss.  I did start the oven that began this whole debacle.  We'll go quietly, perhaps, as I hope, at the behest of Cassius' strange god.  If King Quirkenmire finds us guilty of crimes against the city, I suppose he may be right.  Good intentions never raised the dead.  I feel like I've lost control of my own life.  I miss home.\n\n***S2: Eldritch the Abomination***\n\n*\"I kinda like this whole writin bout Cassius thing. A lot of bards like to tell grandiose tales of heroes being great, but that's not real. Cassius is real. He's a good man, great intentions, and he's fucking up left and right. These are the kinds of blokes they should be writing stories about. It's who I'm writing stories about at least.*\n\n*Anyway, trying to recover from the fiasco of Gateau Inferno (really hoping the name catches on) we've been on some mystery solving runabout. And we keep running into those lousy Zilla heads. And we keep having to kill them. Sometimes it seems like it never stops, and I'm starting to see this whole mess take a toll on Cass. Horse lady is pretty happy-go-lucky, and deer boy Ick is too busy turning into animals for me to get a read on him. But since I'm writing about the holy man I'll point out that this is sort of \"the fall of Cassius Belleronne\" but I think (I hope) it's gonna start looking up for him soon. He's all but hit rock bottom.\"*\n\n[Firefight](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/firefight)\n\n**S3: Bitch-slapped by Providence** *Cassius Bellerone*\n\nOnce again I felt abandoned by this mysterious god who was supposedly guiding me.  I placed my hands on Eldritch’s shoulders and willed the divine power to flow through me.  Nothing happened….again.  Grizzhunch took us off to the jail, per our agreement, and I decided to go quietly.  Eldritch put up a fight but he was subdued by Grizzhunch’s men.  Icarus and Eldritch were placed in a cell together with a bald man, Lady Cat was placed in the (Women’s?) cell, and I was taken to the interrogation room.  I was questioned by Grizzhunch and he found my answers unsatisfactory.  Later, guards came in and took me to a place they called the pit.  I discovered from them that the pit is an area they put their most violent criminals, condemned to their own brutal society.  I resisted and was handedly beaten and thrown in the pit.\n\nDown in the pit I came to face an uncomfortable sensation:  doubt.  I was slapped awake by a dwarven man named Balrus who claimed to be a paladin.  Given his violent nature I would doubt his veracity except he did something that I continually struggled with:  he healed me.  As the sting of his slap faded I felt my previous injuries start to subside.  Balrus accused me of being coated in the same privilege and blindness that afflicted the rest of my social class.  My arrogance had shifted from material gain to divine authority, and I angered my god through my arrogance.  During my conversation with Balrus, surrounded by his 150 men, my companions descended into the pit to save me.  I was touched.  I have known them only briefly and yet they entered a close approximation to hell for my sake.  They did not come without a plan, however, and Icarus quickly arranged for our escape.  A few minutes later my companions, 150 criminals, and I exited the pit and out into Quirktown.\n\nMy companions and I went to the King’s palace to find Priscilla and tell the king what we suspect about Eleanor's death.  He was doubtful of our theories and we honestly did not think it through.  It seemed a battle between Priscilla’s one hundred zillaheads and us was inevitable, but I managed to convince the king to delay until our trial on Monday.  The king also agreed to make both Priscilla and Eldritch co-advisors until the trial at which point he would decide who was guilty and who was innocent.\n\nWith our opportunity in hand we set off to find evidence of Priscilla’s guilt.  Icarus went to meet with Balrus and gain his support should a skirmish be inevitable and Eldritch decided to also go see Balrus (though not at the same time for some reason.  I think Icarus just likes to be an outsider).  Meanwhile, Lady Cat and I went to find the cakemaker to gain more clues about Eleanor’s murder.  The cakemaker Craig told us the order was commissioned by Eleanor but paid for by Priscilla’s Elven financial advisor Chivate.  Craig also gave us the name of an attorney which we probably need.  Lady Cat went off to find the attorney while I followed my deity’s guidance to Chivate.  After being led to the palace entrance I met up with Icarus and Eldritch and we all proceeded into the palace.\n\nChivate was with Priscilla inside the advisor’s office.  After a few heated words with Eldritch she and Chivate left to go handle some urgent business.  We searched the room and found vials of poison inside of Priscilla’s makeup bag.  Finally, we found some actual evidence, and I felt my god was not leading on a fool’s errand.  We handed the bag to a worker in the office (his honesty assured) and had him take the evidence to the judge.  We followed my divine sense of direction to the fairground where we met up with Lady Cat (who wants us to help some priest she met)  and found Priscilla and Chivate conspiring.  Icarus used his invaluable ability to transform into animals to spy on their conversation.  He learned of their plot to kill the Prince Grizzhunch and frame us for the job.  Icarus flew off to warn Grizzhunch and I worked to extract Eldritch from his confrontation with Priscilla.  We swiftly made our exit, agreeing to have a drink with Chivate at 8:00 that evening and made our way towards Grizzhunch’s office.  His life is in danger and should he come to harm I do not believe we will be able to convince the King of our innocence or Priscilla’s guilt.  Her 100 Zillaheads are being attacked by Balrus, Grizzhunch is checking out our story, and even the king has his doubts.  Priscilla is getting desperate and it’s forcing her to make bold moves.  Though she is not the one who frightens me.  Chivate is planning and I cannot seem to figure out his plot.  I hope my mysterious god will give me guidance, that they will lead me on the correct path because now I feel I’m failing my vow of judgment.  I am lost and without my companions my life would be twice ended.  Maybe they were sent to me by my deity.  I hope that my god is watching over me because I’m filled with self-doubt.\n\n***S3: EtA***\n\n*\"I believe I previously said Cassius had hit rock bottom. I was very wrong. He was almost immediately thrown into a pit of criminals.*\n\n*We all got arrested, actually. Nothing new for me, and I was the only one that went with a fight. I don't think the others and I have the same concept of having fun, but oh well.*\n\n*Anyway, they realized too late that Cass is the son of someone very important, so they send me and Horse Lady into this mysterious \"the pit\" to get him out alive. Apparently its full of the 150 most dangerous criminals Quirktown has ever seen. Sounds like a regular show for me, honestly.*\n\n*Ick got out on bail and broke into the pit to meet us. And then broke out. And bought rope and broke back in. The world's simplest escape plan ever. What could go wrong?*\n\n*Ick could tell the leader of the criminals there was an escape plan. Now they're all coming with us or they kill Cass. No sweat on my conscience, I even led the charge, but it certainly didn't seem like the smartest way to do things in hindsight. Then again, I'm not a very smart man.*\n\n*Most notably about the pit was their leader. Balrus. Big ol' paladin with glowing tusks. He tried to smack some sense into Cass. A little embarrassing for Cassius, I'm sure, to have a criminal tell him he's bad being a paladin. So that's where we are in the Epic of Cassius. Immediately after the 'Fall of Cass' is the actual honest-to-goodness \"Cassius hits Rock Bottom\"\"*\n\n[King of the Pit](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/king-of-the-pit)\n\n**S4: Somoas and the Fishmonger** *Lady Caistine*\n\nEldritch was drunk. His staggering steps were slowing us down on our way to warn Grizzhunch of his impending death. If things continued on the way they had been, he’d be dead just after we arrived at his apartments and we would, of course, be framed for his murder. Icarus flew ahead, leaving me and Cassius to deal with the rock star.\n\nBy the time we made it to Grizzhunch’s house, the fierce lady behind the door let us in with only a little difficulty and we reunited with Icarus. The prince, I was glad to see, was still alive and looked to be in good health. The room didn’t appear to contain any immediate signs that he would die within the next few minutes too (what a relief!). We were trying to convince him of Priscilla’s plot against his life, but he seemed reluctant to believe us. He was far more concerned with the men we let out of the pit – but, honestly, what did the city expect? You can’t just throw the most dangerous criminals in a hole in the middle of the city and say “Oh, problem solved!” \n\nWe were interrupted by two ladies calling out that they had girl scout cookies for sale. Eldritch’s eyes lit up at the words. The prince, though, was worried. Apparently the two ladies outside the door came from the pit and wanted some sort of revenge on him. Here was the impending doom that we were worried about. Probably.\n\nStar and Melody burst into the room (literally!) sending the door straight into Icarus and toppling him over. I managed a shot of magic at the tall blonde before the boys got in my way. Just as well, a close-quarter fighter I am not. Eldritch began to play and inspired Melody so much that she swung her hammer with enough enthusiasm that it swung too far backwards and smacked Star in the face in a killing blow. Within moments we were able to subdue Melody and tied her up with Icarus’ lovely ladder. Eldritch, still focused on cookies, asked her if she had any.\n\nThe rest of us were lest concerned about somoas and more concerned about Grizzhunch. Just because one danger was taken care of didn’t mean another wasn’t on its way. We learned that the prince was adopted and that the entire royal line of Quirktown was infertile.\n\nWe sent a message to Madrion about his impending danger (a warning given by Cassius’ mysterious god) and split up. Eldritch and Icarus went off to save the cook and get some cookies, while Cassius and I stayed behind. I wanted to immediately begin following Star’s now missing body. Bodies don’t just disappear (usually). There was a sinking feeling in my stomach that it was related to the mystery Father Isiah had turned me onto at the church.\n\nCassius continued to talk to Grizzhunch though. This was the second time we had ended up together as a pair and the second time he seemed to completely ignore me and focus on who knows what. Perhaps after we found Star I would take him to the church so he could take in the seriousness of the problem himself. \n\nOr not. The last thing we needed was him making more vows and oaths or promises. \n\nI ended up forcing the matter by going to stand outside to wait for Cassius. There was a blood trail that began from where Star’s body had fallen and led to a sewer cover. Cassius followed me out soon after. I knew his sense of honor wouldn’t leave me to follow the trail alone. He made short work of opening the sewer for which I was both grateful and mortified by. A lady walking through sewage? Mother would be shaking her head in shame. I was just glad that I had traded in my lovely silk slippers for the sturdy leather boots I now wore. At least they would offer my feet some protection from the muck.\n\nWe followed the blood trail making idle chit chat along the way, although Cassius accused me of having feelings for Icarus. How absurd! Not to mention impolite: a lady should not discuss such things. \n\nThe blood trail took a sharp turn upwards and we began formulating a plan to get up. We had no ladder to use at this entrance. Cassius boosted me up so I could try to pry open the manhole cover from below. I slipped from his grip though and fell into the muck of the sewer. It was then that we were accosted by zombies. A hollow sort of fear crept into my throat and settled between my lungs. The undead were definitive proof that there was a necromancer in Quriktown. \n\nWe made short work of the undead. One of my spells had gone wide (I really needed to find some time to practice shooting at targets. How was I supposed to know that combative spells would be more important that the illusions I had so diligently practiced?). The blast knocked the manhole cover out of place and also alerted whoever was up there of our presence. \n\nOnce again, Cassius lifted me up and without the heavy slab of metal in the way, I was able to climb out. There was a ladder to my left, tables with bottles scattered on them, various knives and tools, and Star’s body lying on an alter in front of me. The little shack appeared to be both a ritual site and a laboratory. Cassius called out to me and suggested I hack off her head. I fought him a bit and while we argued the manhole cover fell from where it had been wedged into the ceiling and separated us. I was alone, in a necromancer’s shack, with a body of highly dangerous criminal.\n\nHe was right though. The best way to ensure that Star stayed dead was to get her head. I took a knife and a sack from around the hut and got to the gruesome work. The spinal column proved especially difficult and I tried to focus on anything else besides her face, her human skin, the blood that had dried thickly to the altar beneath her.\n\nAfter I had the blonde’s head securely tucked away in a sack I grabbed, I left the shack to try to find my way back to my friends. The sooner the better. While always willing to defend myself, fighting is hard and I have little skill for it.\n\nA strange man found me just outside the shack. He was a fish monger and asked for my help selling his wares.\n\n“I would!” I replied. “But I’m in the middle of something right now.” He then wanted to know what was in the sack. “The thing that I’m in the middle of.” I hoped he wouldn’t offer to help me out. How embarrassing it would be to be caught carrying a head.\n\nThe man didn’t take the hint though, and pushed me harder to sell “my fish,” which, I realized with sudden clarity, meant that he wanted to prostitute me! He threatened to cut me open and I retaliated by sending such a furious blast of magic at him that he was instantly killed. He gave me shivers of disgust and fear. Quirktown was better with him dead. I hoped that that knowledge would alleviate the growing guilt in me. First hacking off a head, now murdering an unprepared man. It got me thinking, however, that perhaps Quirktown may have been on to something with their pit.\n\nBalrus came out of a nearby door. He seemed happy enough to see him. I began cutting off Daddy’s head, this spinal column giving me less trouble this time around. There was a desperate sort of wish in me that dismembering bodies wouldn’t become something I was talented at. I should have waited, in hind-sight to remove Daddy’s head. I suppose I wanted to appear tough in front of Balrus. Weakness would probably get me killed or worse. Stupidly, I let it slip that I was hunting bounties. \n\nImmediately his demeanor changed. No longer was I welcomed near him. He pointed me on the way out of this district. I followed, cautiously. There was some hope in me that he had enough good will left to not get me murdered. It turns out that that was wrong. Trashpile found me walking about and told me I was heading straight to Murdertown (another note: why is there a town inside a town? Another quirk, I suppose).\n\nTrashpile took me to the precinct where I was able to collect the bounty for Star, Melody, and Daddy. Now that I knew where I was, it was time to meet up at the bar with my friends (finally!). I gave them their share of Star and Melody’s bounties, holding on to Daddy’s. His could help cover the cost of the lawyer and then we could split what was left. Besides, they didn’t kill Daddy, nor offer to help with Tahlora’s expenses. (Of course, I would never ask for money. Mother would absolutely have a conniption she found out!) \n\nThe boys briefly filled Cassius and myself in on their ordeal. Together (and what an unlikely paring: a rockstar and an ambassador) they managed to stop Tyrion, the town guard, and some of Priscilla’s fans (I refuse to call them ‘Zilla heads, what a horrendous sounding name) from killing each other. Afterwards the two tracked Madrion down and saved him from some more town guards. The king was bound and determined to bring him back for “justice.”\n\nEldirtch was most proud to announce that he had finally gotten his somoas. It appeared that he was still under some influences.\n\nIcarus had stopped at the snake log trap on the way back to town and managed to become a snake…prophet? Deity? It was a bit confusing to follow. He was granted a magical spear that allowed him to summon snakes when he needed them, so obviously he was an extremely important influence to the reptiles.\n\nAfter we all went inside and decided to celebrate our successes. Priscilla approached me at the bar. She was, of course, exceedingly snobbish and also interested in Eldritch and myself. What a ludicrously popular conversational topic today. She made me feel self-conscious about my place amongst my friends and tried to make me feel bad about my parent’s arranging my performance for Quirktown. As if I didn’t know that there was little in the way of prospects for the eighth child of a minor noble family. Why did she think I was out adventuring instead of marrying? I conjured a cute kitten on the bar and she left towards Eldritch (poor fellow) in a huff. Cassius seemed to be deeply engrossed in a conversation with Chivate. Yet another man who terrified me. Quirktown was less adorable than the name would imply.\n\nAfter a few drinks, I felt satisfactorily numb and pleasant enough to go to bed. No thoughts of necromancers or cutting heads off or being hunted for me tonight! \n\nAlas, a strange woman was leaning against my door. \n\n“I thought you’d look tougher.” Were some of the first words she said to me. She used to “work” for Daddy and thanked me for killing him. She showed me her scars and told me her story. It was enough to sober me up fast and made me fell ill. Her name was Cat as well. It was just a minor miracle of happenstance that she had been born in Quirktown and I had been given an idyllic life. The pit may have been an astoundingly awful idea, but perhaps we should have been a bit more concerned about letting out 150 of Quirktown’s most dangerous criminals. There were innocent people that were now in grave danger because of our rash decisions. I gave the other Cat all of Daddy’s bounty. The others surely couldn’t be mad as they didn’t know about it and she needed the money more than I did.\n\nIt was possible, of course, that she was “playing” me (what a strange turn of phrase, I wonder where it came from?). With all that had happened to me, my enthusiasm for being a wizard was quickly waning. This was no adventure book. I was determined to hold on to the best parts of me, though, and that meant trusting Cat at her word. The mysterious lady had also alerted me to the fact that she could find me unusual items if I needed them.\n\nAs she left, I was (finally) able to go into my room and see the most beautiful bed of my life. I had no doubts that I would sleep soundly through the night. I was so tired and we had been up for so long!\n\n***S4: EtA***\n\n*\"I spent most of the day drunk. Ran into an old friend. I don't much want to talk about it.\"*\n\n[Old Friend Blues](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/old-friend-blues)\n\n**S5: Gravehoppin' and the INFINITE BRICK WALL~~~** *Eldritch the Abomination*\n\nSo I woke up just shy of a nooner with a killer headache and promptly threw up in a barrel. Just about filled the barrel too. Oh and my fucking god damn lute was gone. Cass was pounding on the door and let himself in just in time to see the end of what I think might be my most monstrous ralph to date. \n\nHe seemed a bit off. I mean more than his usual bumbling self-righteous self. But he was particularly bumbling this morning. We went to go get the others and he just wildly knocked on doors looking for the others, including me. I don’t know if I’ll ever understand this guy. \n\nWe eventually got everyone rounded up and we just haaad to have a meeting about doing court stuff and law things. Gotta figure out what we’re gonna ask a ghost and Cass keeps bragging about how is mind is “like an infinite brick wall.” We must seem absolutely mental to anyone outside our group. \n\nLots of boring stuff happened. I checked up on the bounties at the police station. I think Ick ate a sandwich. Cat ate a book or something. I don’t really know the others were doing. I was mostly babysitting my unusually idiotic companion. \n\nOh, and as if it’s not enough I have to keep look after a borderline-retarded paladin, I had to take him across town to babysit a grumpy deformed prince with a day job. Before we all went to the funeral of the woman we accidentally burned alive in a giant cake. \n\n*We must seem absolutely mental.*\n\nWell lucky me I found my lute at the funeral. Cause that’s normal. Prissy decided to write a song and dedicate it to the would-be queen. It was actually a really good song. BECAUSE IT WAS MY SONG I WROTE. Didn’t have nearly enough melodic pop progressions and empty lyrics about flowers and skulls to be hers. \n\nAnd THEN I had to go babysit a cemetery. I don’t much appreciate having to look after things all day. I’m more of a thing-ruiner or thing-destroyer than a thing-preserver. Whatever those fucking words would be. \n\nWell Cass runs off to go do his own babysitting of Grizzhunch. That should go swimmingly. So it’s off to the cemetery. Just me, a horse lady, and a dog with antlers. And everyone fell asleep. And we got attacked by undead. Yay.\nMe and Cat kill two and go to find our trusty hound who’s chased a necromancer into the sewers. Crazy people, the lot of us. \n\nWe go to save Ick but we get attacked by undead. Cat just about died and got bit by an infector. So I had to pee in the wound to save her but some fucking kid took a picture. I didn’t even know cameras existed. \n\nIcing on my fucking day was to find Ick laying on the ground as a snake (a messianic snake, mind you) with no pulse. It’s ok though. He’s not dead. Just reeeeallllly catatonic. I know when things are dead.\n\n***S5: EtA Part 1***\n\n*\"Woke up feeling about dead from a massive hangover, went to a funeral, and then went to play watchman at a cemetery. Big ol' day of death. Not that I'm complaining.*\n\n*Basically we had to watch over a church 'cause some creep's been sneaking in and stealing corpses for (most likely) some good old fashioned necromancy. So me, the horse lady, and the deer boy sat there all night (no tales of Cassius today, sorry. He was busy being useless) til the alleged necromancer showed up. Got into a bit of a tussle with some of his undead minions. Ick chased him underground and almost died. We followed to save him and Cat almost died. Fun night, all in all.*\n\n*It kinda reminded me of being a teenager again and gettin up to mischief when there was nothing better to do. So I made a little bit of an upbeat tune.\"*\n\n[Gravehoppin](https://soundcloud.com/eldritch-the-abomination/gravehoppin)\n\n***S5: EtA Part 2***\n\n*\"The much awaited Trial of Cassius Bellaronne was a little lackluster, to be quite honest. We summoned the ghost of Polonius and and his testimony got us a not-guilty and simultaneously got chv8 a guilty. But due to some clever moves by Mr.8, Cass lost his god-given powers and Prissy got off scott-free. Cass looked a little beat up over it, I don't think he felt like he won. That kinda works for his story, though, you know? The major conflict in the Epic of Cassius has been resolved, but he still needs something. From a narrative standpoint, he's just wrapped up \"the first act\" so to speak. So this is an interlude. Short, sweet, to the point.

        "text": "I had a friend who we'll call Jay. Jay is a fantastic roleplayer, but when it comes to actual rules and mechanics, he's not so great. Also, he has a habit of designing flaws into his characters so deep that it makes in hard to actually play. These are the stories of how Jay's characters from the Age of Worms adventure path all died. **Spoilers.** *Of course.*\n\nSo when everyone gathered around the table to start the two year long process of playing Age of Worms, we had some interesting characters hit the table. Our first was an elven rogue/sorcerer who was expelled from his university for stealing. Then we had a half-ogre barbarian who was being pressured into joining a thuggish organization. Our third was a dwarven cleric who was little more than a clerk asked to check up on some dwarven complaints from within this small mining town. And then there was Jay.\n\nJay loved dark elves. Whenever he got the chance, he defaulted to dark elf. Thankfully, he never played a Chaotic Good dark elf who carried around two scimitars and fought against his dark past. No, Jay typically played Chaotic Evil arrogant asshole dark elf. So when he showed me his character sheet for a dark elf druid, I was a little surprised, but only a little. \"Lawful neutral?\"\n\nJay explained that his character, Zain, was a dark elf that had been orphaned above ground and lost his sight almost immediately in the blinding bright world above and that nature had helped him where his senses failed. So he ended up as a beggar on the streets of town. We played a few sessions and it was clear that Jay had no idea how to play a druid (his first feat was Blind Fight and the only spell he would use was *obscuring mist* to \"even the odds\"). When he took his first level of monk it made a little more sense, but he still wasn't what you'd call an effective character.\n\nAnyway, cut to the end of the first dungeon, where the party enters a room with a massive swirling whirlwind of air in the center and a series of murals around the walls. Zain has survived this long, but pretty much on the backs of his comrades. The cleric and sorcerer start looking at the murals while the barbarian decides his going to guard the door. Zain, being blind, has no need to look at the walls and walks across a narrow bridge to the whirlwind.\n\n\"I'd like to put my hand in it.\"\n\n\"Are you sure? I mean, everyone else is pretty far away.\"\n\n\"Yeah, what happens?\"\n\nJay fails his Listen check after disturbing the wind and declares loudly to the table, \"It's cool guys, there's nothing here!\" Meanwhile everyone sees the two warriors made of wind that had floated out of the maelstrom, swords in hand. In a quick motion they sliced the poor druid in two and his body fell into the darkness below. [*Mechanically, no one entered the surprise round, and the two wind warriors attacked the low-health, flat-footed blind man and completely killed him.*]\n\nJumping forward by a session, and the remaining players meet with a local wizard who became quite important to our game, but I've since forgotten his name, so we'll call him Tim. Tim needed the group to look into some shady mining business that was going on in town and wanted to send along his assistant to make sure that everything went well. It quickly became evident that Tim was sending his assistant away because he was annoying. Enter Jay's second character.\n\nTippletop Haberdasher Quickfinger Tiddlewink Gemsnatcher (we just called him \"Tip\") was a gnomish bard with a heavy German accent and a love for gems of all kinds. Tip would often get his coin converted into gemstones and kept his shining beauties sealed in an ornate chest with him at all times. He actually spent most of his share of the treasure on getting more gems, often at the expense of his own equipment.\n\nTo say that Tip survived a bunch of situations he shouldn't have would be an understatement. He ran into a cavern filled with yellow mold because he swore he saw \"somezing shiney in za mold.\" He clambered onto a statue with gems set in it's eyes and nearly died when an evil cleric cast stone to mud on the base. Hell, he faced off against that same evil cleric armed only with his small rapier and a Strength of 8 and managed to live. So when he did die, it was actually a bit of a relief for everyone.\n\nAt one point, the group was infiltrating (unknowingly) a mind flayer's lair. This was probably when the group was at it's worst: the sorcerer had some poison or disease, the cleric was taking his first levels of Inquisitor and was trying to get a handle on his power, and the barbarian of the group had already died at least once (and was *breath of life*'d back, I believe? It's been awhile). Tip, meanwhile was probably in the worst shape. The party had fought off some giant spiders, or some sort of spider/mind flayer hybrid. Whatever it was, it was bad and Tip was horribly poisoned. He was at the point where he had 0 in one of his attributes and couldn't walk. \"Leave me here,\" he said to the group and held up his little rapier. \"Come get me when you're done.\" So the group went ahead to fight the mind flayer while they left Tip behind.\n\nThe literally left him in the spider nest. Just set down the poisoned, immobile bard in the spider nest. When they came back, Tip was gone and the group wrote it off as, \"Well, I mean, he was really annoying and was more trouble than he's worth.\" Given that Tip kept all his treasure back at home, the team didn't have too much motivation to search for his body and they left the gnome to his fate as a spider snack.\n\nAlright, last character! After the party had continued for awhile, they were invited to join a gladiatorial tournament, with some dark deeds taking place within. Unfortunately, they needed another member to enter. Along came Jay's third character, a Lawful Neutral hobgoblin monk. This guy absolutely didn't fit with the party and it showed in a million different ways. He was very disciplined and had a strict code of honor that made him hate the way the sorcerer/rogue would sneak around or how the barbarian... well, barbarian'd. He got along famously with the dwarven cleric, who hated him because he was a dirty, foul pit fighting hobgoblin. Oh, yeah, Hobgoblin here also had no manners and was pretty damn blunt.\n\nHob survived the tournament and it wasn't long before our campaign started to develop side stories of its own. The cleric had rescued several of the miner dwarves and set up a small fortress away from the town and above the old desecrated mine. He was slowly cleansing the place and turning it into a giant underground temple to Muradin. So I, as the DM, thought it would be fun to stage an attack on the place that tied in with the Kyuss undead becoming more powerful. When the party arrived ahead of the attack, they were greeted by a very well built up and defended community (which the cleric and I had been working on via emails with downtime) and a series of portraits for each of the heroes: the sorcerer, the barbarian, the cleric, and Tip.\n\n\"Who the fuck is this asshole?\" I remember Hob saying.\n\nAnyway, the attack came and it went well at first. The dwarven militia that they cobbled together could hold the line well, but the undead kept coming. Worse yet, several Kyuss cultists were seen on the battlefield throwing out spells and bolstering the undead. Hob did the only thing he knew how and rushed out to fight them. He fought well, but eventually the call came to fall back to the inner portions of the fortress. The honorable monk wouldn't hear of it and kept fighting, knowing that he would rather die than show fear in the face of the enemy. [*Everyone around the table stared at Jay like he was an idiot.*] And die he did as the hordes of undead slowly piled over his body.\n\nAnd that was the last game we played with Jay for a year before we switched to Pathfinder and he showed us his latest character, a hobgoblin flighter/rogue/cavalier/cleric. Yeah, Jay is really bad at making characters.",

        "text": "So me and a new party just started playing Numenera. GM is new to system and so is running a pre-gen module.\n\n Bad things happen to party, including having inscect-fungal-hybrids attatching themselves to 1/2 the parties' spine. Welcome to Numenera.\n\nAfter this we're lead down 2 hrs (yup, 2 hours) of caverns to the \"queen\" by a moving statue, who is bleeding a luminescent ooze. Welcome to Numenera.\n\nSaid queen turns out to be a 70ft long worm with tentacles coming out of her / its mouth, each with a different tool on the end, who could speak, and who at the time the party walked in was dissecting human corpses in a millennia old lab. Welcome to Numenera.\n\nAt this point I look at the GM in an \"Ok, we messed up, can we regen characters now please?\" kinda way. You see, being a veteran of 1st ed D&amp;D, traveler and Dark Heresy, I was expecting this to be the \"Y'all messed up, here's the unwinnable bossfight, now go back and do it properly\" style of game. And then another player, a relatively newer roleplayer asked \"Do you have anything you'd like us to do for you?\"\n\nI was in uproar, I couldn't believe he'd asked a question as stupid as that, I mean in what roleplay had you ever thought to have a 70 ft ancient worm be a questgiver, much less one that dissects humans to see what does what. I berated this guy for over a minute and sarcastically looked at the GM and said: \"Does this thing have a giant, floating, yellow exclamation mark over it's head?\"\n\nGM looks me square in the eyes and says \"Yes.\"\n\nWelcome to Numenera.",

        "text": "This story is years old at this point, but I still love telling it. It was my first gaming group in high school and everyone had pretty set characters they liked. One guy always played wizards and sorcerers, another always played simple, easy fighters, and one guy always had to play a rogue.\n\nThen there was our star of the story. We'll call him Jay. Jay's first character was a Chaotic Evil Drow Fighter who killed everyone in the party by the second session. His second character was a Lawful Evil half-fiend monk/sorcerer who wanted to challenge his fiendish father for control of a layer of Hell. His third character was a ruthless assassin/necromancer out to take over the local kingdom. And so on and so on.\n\nWe sort of got used to Jay's characters and after a while, even started to relish the fun times of putting up with his usual \"Time to buy my *ring of undetectable alignment*,\" or \"No one is around me as I do this, right?\"\n\nSo you can imagine our surprise when he shows up to the first session of a new campaign with a Lawful Good Paladin of Pelor. Of course, no one believed that this would last. I believe in the words of one of my other players, \"If he's doesn't become a Blackguard, I'll throw my dice away.\"\n\nThe first session was surprising though. After hunting down a gang of thieves through a sewer system, Jay the Paladin killed one of the thieves. He had, up until then, been wounding them and keeping them stable with his Heal skill. However, he managed to get a crit on one of these poor thieves and completely eviscerated him. Jay looked at the man and asked if there was anything he could do to put the man at peace before he passed on. \"My son...,\" the man said producing a blood-spattered drawing of his son from under his vest. \"I did this all for him.\" And then the man died. [*This was me being a horrible monster and making them realize that the people they were fighting were, at the end of the day, people. I didn't expect what happened next.*]\n\nJay gathered up the party after they put the bandits to rout and told them of what happened. No one cared. I mean, the sorcerer personally went through the sewers blasting people with *burning hands* and laughing the whole time. But Jay had to put things right. He had the rogue make some Gather Information checks and eventually tracked down the now-orphaned son, a young boy of 11 named Jonas.\n\n\"Jonas,\" Jay had said to him. \"Bad things happen to good people and I'm here to tell you that your father got mixed up in some bad things. And you're alone now.\" The boy, predictably began to cry, but Jay continued. \"But you can accept Pelor into your heart and be alone no longer. I can train you in his ways.\" And with that, Jay essentially adopted Jonas and began his paladin training. [*After, of course, I explained to him that he would have to take the Leadership feat to allow Jonas to take paladin levels and join in combat and the like.*]\n\nJonas became something of a mascot for the team as they adventured. Several adventures revolved around the young man growing up and learning to make better moral decisions and Jonas proved himself several times in battle, even rescuing the rogue from a sea monster at one point. Jonas also became Jay's rallying cry when the paladin was flagging or things were feeling hopeless. When the Jay could go on no longer, Jonas was there to tell him to keep fighting the good fight.\n\nEventually, our campaign was creeping into the higher levels and the story was becoming more focused. Orcus was planning a nasty plot on the Material Plane and the party was there to foil him at every turn. Jay and Jonas were the spearheads of this crusade, naturally. The sorcerer kept tabs on the planes to make sure things weren't getting too shaken up, while the rogue and the fighter acted as scouts and mercenaries looking for the next place to strike. When the rogue heard word of an island dedicated to the worship of Orcus, Jay was ecstatic. The rogue reported that there were primitive worshipers of Orcus, crazy cannibal death cults that guarded an ancient temple to the demon lord of undeath filled with demonic magic. Everyone hopped aboard a ship (where Jonas saved the rogue) and made their way to the island.\n\nThey fought their way through the cultists (who were more primitive than powerful) and their demonic allies (who were more powerful than primitive) until they found the temple. It appeared as a chunk of coagulated blood squatting on the island, carved from one piece of hellish material. It was massive in scale and the fully expected to take days to clear it out, if even at all. Jay, however, had a plan. They would sneak in, disguised as cultists (not hard since the rogue and sorcerer had employed the ol' disguise trick several times on human opponents) and take out the leaders of this temple. Then, with their morale broken, they could destroy the place from within. [*As the DM, I really thought that they were just putting themselves into a tricky spot for no reason, but everyone seemed to agree that this was the* **best** *course of action.*]\n\nThe plan worked well, and almost no one saw through the disguises. Those that did, quickly found themselves dragged off into a corner by the rogue who was following behind out of disguise. When they reached the central chamber, they found a mass of cultists in some sort of religious fervor and a high priest before a bloodstained altar guiding the ceremony. [*This was going to be where the players encountered a summoned demon, but given their cleverness for the disguises, I decided that their speed would allow them to arrive before the ceremony completed.*] Jay told everyone to take up positions around the room while he and Jonas took out the high priest. Again, everyone agreed.\n\nJay and Jonas charge the priest and he goes down *fast*. Everyone around the table was pretty surprised by how quickly it happened, but now Jay was standing in the middle of the room surrounded by cultists. \"Halt, fools!\" he shouted. \"I have merely cast down the weak so that the strong may lead.\" Everyone around the table smiled. Jay was really good at roleplaying out these situations. \"*Alright,*\" I said, \"*but you're gonna need a really good Bluff check for that.*\" Jay just looked at me blankly and said, \"It wasn't a Bluff.\"\n\nJay then described how he grabbed Jonas, threw him onto the altar and stabbed him through the chest.\n\nWhile everyone around the table either went silent or exploded into swearing, Jay pulled out his Book of Vile Darkness and showed me the chapter on sacrifice and all the bonuses that he just racked up. \"See there's the cleric of an opposed deity, pure, good aligned... how many cultists saw that...?\" Then he pulled out a second character sheet, all marked up for being a Blackguard and asked me if he could use his sacrificial boon to gain extra levels in Blackguard.\n\nThen he and the rest of the cultists descended on the remaining party members (with only the sorcerer surviving with several *dimension door* spells and maaaaybe a *teleport*? It's been awhile.). The campaign ended there with everyone leaving pretty mad at Jay. I mean, he did throw away the campaign and kill off everyone's favorite character. But it really wasn't long until we were telling stories about how amazing it was that Jay had planned that all out (\"It just came to me after I got the Book of Vile Darkness!\") and kept up with his good facade for so long.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4a5g7u/pathfinder_why_you_never_steal_from_the_party/",
        "text": "So, I want to preface this story by explaining that this is all in good fun and that those involved were not upset with the events that transpired. Generally, PvP is something I like to avoid but we were up to it and are having fun with this. Anyway, here's the story. \n\nI'm playing as a Paladin in a homebrew game. The main idea is that we're all on an island infested with all sorts of undead and we've been sent to stop it. My character (named Leigh Rathtor, Undead Scourge archetype) joined in the party late and this is where the \"trouble\" begins.\n\nLeigh was sailing to a small island close to the main island but crash landed and ended up stranded. Luckily, this just so happens to be where the main party was headed. The party consists of a Link Clone who cannot speak, a little girl (a witch I believe), and my soon to be nemesis Diego (a drow sorcerer).\n\nSo, they arrive at the island and Diego immediately casts dancing lights. I take notice to this (although I'm very far away yet) and begin traveling to their location. The Party enters an abandoned mansion (and the Link Clone is kidnapped by some monster without the party noticing) and after a short while I arrive inside. \n\nNow, the players in this game LOVE screwing with one another. So the second my righteous paladin enters the mansion, the little girl hatches a cruel prank to play on her drow friend Diego. The little girl begins screaming and claiming that Diego was attempting to \"force himself upon her\". One successful Bluff check later and my Paladin went berserk on Diego. By the time Diego had convinced me to stop stabbing him, he was nearly dead due to sorcerers' squishiness. \n\nOnce the situation was explained, Leigh immediately apologized and used Lay on Hands numerous times to heal Diego. Alas, Diego was not the forgiving type. He claimed that Leigh could never make up for what he had done but the persistent paladin nonetheless seeked to make amends. Leigh vowed that he would do whatever he could to make up for his mistake.\n\nA few sessions went by and tensions were still as high as before. Leigh wished to improve his relationship with Diego but was also greatly disturbed by Diego's penchant for lies and trickery. Diego would often memory lapse people and take advantage of them, something that Leigh was not all too keen on. However, he generally let Diego go about his business and rarely prevented him from doing these things. \n\nAt some point though, Diego realized he could use Leigh's undying loyalty to him as an advantage. So, Diego began abusing the paladin's willingness to make promises. This most often resulted in Diego making deals with Leigh that had \"strings attached\". A good example comes in our most recent session... Where things got a little more ugly.\n\nDiego and Leigh went on a mission together without the rest of the party. Their destination: another haunted mansion. Knowing the dangers of the place, the party stocked up on items. Leigh decided to invest his money into the most expensive Belt of Mighty Strength he could get. The shopkeep promised to craft the Belt and have it ready for Leigh once he returned from the mission.\n\nDiego bought a massive barrel of flammable oil in case the mansion needed to be burned down. The barrel was ridiculously oversized and Diego could not simply carry it around with him. So, he made Leigh an ultimatum. \n\n\"If you carry this barrel for me, I will forgive you.\"\n\nImmediately, Leigh jumped to the task and carried the oversized barrel throughout the mansion. This often lead to him being debilitated in combat and required him to put the barrel down before he did ANYTHING. Nonetheless, he was happy for the opportunity to gain Diego's forgiveness. The two burned down the mansion with the oil, which Diego tried and failed to blame on a guard, and Leigh was excited to now have Diego's forgiveness. Or so he thought.\n\n\"Pick up that barrel, I didn't tell you to stop\"\n\nDiego explained that the paladin promised to carry the barrel, but never specified the length of time Leigh was required to carry it. Since Leigh promised to carry the barrel, he essentially became Diego's eternal pack mule. However, Leigh refused. He refused to be tricked into a corrupt deal and told Diego that he didn't have to make promises to a liar. \n\nSo, Diego decided to play one last trick on the paladin. However, this trick would come back to bite him in a major way. While Leigh was distracted talking to an NPC, Diego snuck off to the magic items shop... The same shop where Leigh's Belt of Mighty Strength +5 awaited. Since Diego was with Leigh when he purchased the belt, the shopkeeper immediately assumed Diego was there to pick up the belt FOR Leigh. One successful Bluff check and Diego had stolen the most expensive thing Leigh had ever purchased. Diego took this one step further and used teleport to travel back to the mansion where he and Leigh had met (the one that wasn't burnt down) and left the belt there.\n\nSo, when Leigh went to claim his belt from the shopkeep, he realized his ally Diego had stolen from him. At that moment, Leigh deemed that Deigo was not a friend but rather a dirty liar and a thief. That was the moment Leigh decided to go full-paladin on Diego.\n\nHe reported the theft to the police who even got the mayor involved due to the value of the stolen object in question. The police have put together a special task force to hunt down Diego and arrest (or kill) him. Leigh informed the task force of Diego's abilities and how he may try to trick and deceive them, weakening Diego's element of surprise. Ultimately, Leigh has decided to join the task force in hunting down his former friend.\n\nWe haven't played out what happens next... But all the players are very excited to see how this plays out. I'll post a follow-up story when we end up playing the session.\n\nTL;DR Paladin is tricked into believing a drow sorcerer is a rapist and beats him up. Drow sorcerer hates paladin and paladin attempts to make it up to drow. Drow begins taking advantage of paladin's good nature and promises until paladin is fed up. Drow steals paladins' Belt of Mighty Strength in retaliation and paladin rallies entire town and police force against drow.",

If I recall correctly, it was a screen captured /tg/ story that involved a player who sold weapons to both sides in a war that he started, a player who was a vampire prince (maybe they were a princess), and another character who was in a relationship with the vampire character. The weapons seller was secretly the antagonist for a good chunk of the game, then came out as the villain for the last bit of it after taking over and wiping out his own home nation and doing some serious damage to the other PCs. After that, he went on to pretty much take over the galaxy.\n\nAnyone remember this story or know where to find it?",

        "text": "###INTRODUCING: IRON THRONE POWERS\n\nWe are a collaborative role-playing subreddit based in the universe of George R. R. Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire* fantasy series. If you love the books, this is the game for you. You can play as the existing characters we all know and love, or create new ones, rule holdfasts, build alliances, wage war and play the Game of Thrones. \n\nThe game is based off the model of /r/worldpowers, in which each \"claim\" rules their own holdfast, and is in charge of armies, resources, and characters. We structure the game around rules and mechanics, but we leave plenty of space for creativity. We have a fast-paced and active game going on, and we are always welcoming new players and interesting new characters and plotlines! The game does not only revolve around the RPing between players, but the numerous stories that are written and crafted. Our goal is to have fun creating a story together, and for more than a year we have been doing exactly that. \n\nWe've had an Ironborn rebellion, a Dornish secession, a war to depose the Mad King, and even a Tourney of Harrenhal. Currently we're playing in the year 305 AC during the reign of King Corlys I of House Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen. Tensions are mounting, armies are moving, and spiders are whispering. This \"peace\" is the perfect time for new players to hop in.\n\n\n###LORE POST: One of our many 'gametales' \n\nThis post was surprising because no one expected the King, Aerys, to just stroll into the Harrenhal Tournament and make this bombshell announcement; Harrenhal is one of the major holdings in the region of Riverland, which itself is a part of the Kingdom of Westeros. \n\nUp until now he had been descending into insanity, but never enough to warrant a proclamation like this. After this post was made, everyone fled Harrenhal because they knew a war was about to erupt between the King and his vassal, Lord Tywin Lannister of Casterly Rock. \n\n&gt;He was awoken by the sounds of revelry. They burned bonfires, talking and shouting beneath their colored tents. Knights, fools, and minstrels walked with velvet-clad lords, and squires rushed through the crowds carrying bits and pieces of armor. Few knew that the King had just joined the fun. \n\n&gt;All under the black walls of Harrenhal they'd come together, joined in each other's arms and laughter, to meet their doom. The lords here were no different than Harren and his sons, and the breeze of a dragon's wing-beats brushed back their hair and warmed their faces. Aerys had arrived, and he carried with him a doom that Harrenhal was more than accustomed too. \n\n&gt;He walked amongst them, turning heads as he went, moving closer and closer to the great castle on the darkening water. Their voices turned to whispers, and their heads turned to him. His palanquin drudged along, up, up, up to the very top. His gold cloaks kept the revelers back. From his high point on a hill (though not nearly as high as Harrenhal, which watched over all) Aerys spoke to the realm. \n\n&gt;\"I am your King, Aerys Targaryen the Second. I have an announcement to make.\" He paused and looked out on the lake. This isle of faces was covered in ash. Some things couldn't take the heat. Maybe the Seven Kingdoms couldn't take the fire that was about to spark, but it mattered not. The King had always been truthful. \n\n&gt;\"It has come to my attention that I have a son and a daughter.\" Some in the crowd shouted back at him, expressing their joy at the news. He raised his hand, and the congratulations stopped. \n\n&gt;\"They are here, at this very tournament. Their names are Cersei and Jaime. You may know them as Lannisters, but that is only half-true. They are the children of Joanna, yes, but not of Tywin. The twins are my own, and I legitimize them under the dark of Harrenhal and the Light of the Seven.\" He looked at the baffled crowd. \n\n&gt;\"Rise, Cersei and Jaime Targaryen, rise as Dragons.\"\n\n###HELPFUL LINKS:\n\nFor more information, feel free to peruse our handy [welcome post](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThronePowers/comments/49ew0t/asoiaf_game_on_reddit/) for new players. [Here is also a list of claims available in our game](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fmTM7nBBAaeeHPycnqTKyGXNxOwLJ7QK8nUx0rVoD-o/edit#gid=0); players can also choose to play as single characters rather than an entire house.

        "text": "This actually happened today, and I wanted to get it out there because of how crazy it was. I think this is the greatest XCOM mission I have ever had or, at least, the greatest 3 turns in my experience playing XCOM.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI started a new XCOM 2 playthrough on Commander Ironman, meaning the second hardest difficulty and where it auto-saves after every move, preventing the player from taking back any decision they made. I've been performing pretty well at this point, no missions failed yet surprisingly enough, although quite a few had heavy casualties.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe get a transmission concerning a Supply Raid mission, and seeing the opportunity to get some extra goodies for better weapons, I send out a squad of Corporals, one of each class, to seize the cargo. Standard mission, we take out the first two squads with no problem despite the second containing the first Muton in this run, our Ranger taking a single shot that knocked him down to half health.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI reposition my soldiers in better cover, reloading as they do so we're ready for the next squad, starting with the Ranger. Things take a turn for the worst once I move up the Specialist. She triggers the third squad, consisting of a Viper, a Trooper, and a Lancer, with her movement, and they spring into action, getting an immediate flank on the Ranger. The only soldier left is the Grenadier and I have her launch a grenade into the enemy squad while the Specialist uses her drone to give the Ranger additional defenses.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is where things fall apart. In order; the Ranger is shot by the Trooper and takes critical damage, dead before he hits the ground. The Lancer moves up and stabs the Grenadier, sending her into a bleed-out. The Viper grabs the Specialist with its tongue and gets them in a bind. The Sharpshooter, who's way back at the spawn point covering them, panics and hunkers down, attempting to give himself more defense.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith no soldiers available, my turn is skipped and the enemies get to take another move, effectively sealing my fate. The Lancer runs back to the Specialist, who's now down to 2 HP, and takes a swing at the bound soldier, but to my fortune, misses completely. The Trooper gets into cover and tries to finish what the Lancer could not. Lo and behold, the second verse is the same as the first, and the Specialist miraculously survives.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy turn, and I have one soldier, the Sharpshooter. The good news is that he can take a shot at their squad from where he's currently at. The bad news? That's all he, and by extension me, can do to salvage this mission. He has two choices: the Lancer, an easy shot at 71%, or the Viper, a harder shot at 35%, but will give the Specialist her move again if it hits.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI take a minute to consider my options and settle on the Viper, knowing that if I can get my Specialist back, I still have a chance at pulling this off. I roll the dice and prepare for the worst.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe takes aim, lining the target up in the scope. There's a tense pause then like the crack of thunder, the silence is broken by the gunshot. I watch, helpless, as the bullet flies halfway across the map.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; CRITICAL: 8 Damage\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThrough some act of God, he not only lands the shot, he lands a critical, annihilating the Viper and freeing the Specialist. Now there's a chance to pull this out again. I pull the Specialist back to full cover and have her target the Lancer who's standing completely in the open.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; CRITICAL: 8 Damage\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFollowing the Sharpshooter's lead, she fills the Lancer full of so much lead he could be used to shield people from radiation. With that, I've taken a single soldier vs. three enemies to two soldiers vs. a single enemy.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Trooper scrambles, tries to finish the Specialist, and misses *again.* The turn order comes back to me, and I use the Specialist's full turn to stabilize and revive the Grenadier, bringing her back into the fight. I send her up to flank the Trooper and it's like shooting fish in a barrel.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs the smoke clears, Central comes over the comms to announce that all hostiles have been neutralized and that our mission's complete. We fly back to base and there are promotions all around for the survivors alongside some sweet alien tech to turn into new weapons.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd that's the story of Operation Buried King, or the single greatest XCOM mission I've ever had.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR** - Entire squad incapacitated or dead, somehow survive and turn the entire mission in my favor with a single turn.",

I tell you, this day just keeps getting better and better (and I do say that with utmost sarcasm).\n\nAfter finishing the last entry, I returned to Bordel and apologized for my outburst. I also renewed my resolve to continue onward and fulfill my obligations. My boss gave a toothy grin. It looked remarkably similar to Achmath’s overly optimistic smiles, which was comforting in it’s own way. But, I wish I had held out five minutes more.\n\nSoon after speaking with Bordel, murmurs of a bounty to deliver and a cart to retrieve had just surfaced when a caravan was spotted. My traitorous heart yearned to run away with it, but luckily I take pride in my integrity. I settled with looking longingly as the group drew nigh and began to pass us. That was when I spotted my Nanny!\n\n“Hannah Gimble?” I called out. Before she could confirm it was her, I found myself walking toward her. Hannah looked at me with the same bout of surprise. She had aged since I last saw her. I was twelve when she moved on to a new family. And here it was, seven years later, her hair graying with winkles about her face.\n\n“Malaney Belrue?” she questioned. Still we collided with one another, I exclaiming something along the lines of, “Normalcy!” It was the greatest comfort I had felt over the last many months. The familiar face and reminder of home was overwhelming, I wish there was a way I could have harnessed it.\n\nAfter brief introductions, I asked why she was all the way over here. Our home town, Ruebis, was on the other side of the world. According to her, there’s some truth to the rumors swirling about my father’s death. Folk had speculated he died as a result of financial swindling and scandal, but for what I knew of Theedain, he was a good and honest man. The rumors were nothing more than slander thrown out by envious competitors or bitter businessmen who didn’t get their way.\n\nWith Hannah headed to Asura to look in on a potential third party involvement, it has filled me with uncertainty. I’m not sure if I am more concerned about my father being involved with some kind of scheme or if he truly was murdered versus dying peacefully.\n\nAnyways, I had to say my goodbyes to Hannah. I clung to her a long moment, tears escaping my eyes. Even though I tried to urge the others to go back to the capital, Fern once more reminded us of her dream that suggested a return would not bode well for us.\n\nWhich reminds me, I never wrote down the dream I had the other night. Let’s see... there was this grand scale, both side perfectly balanced. Underneath it was a large, spoked wheel, similar to what you’d find on a great ship. On either side was Bahamut and Tiamat, working together to turn the wheel. If either stopped, the scale would tip, becoming unbalanced, and the wheel would stop moving.\n\nI remember mention it to the others, but everyone else was too groggy or in some kind of funk. As I sit here writing this out, it seems more obvious the omen it was sending, but I’ll get to that later.\n\nAfter Hannah left, Sugalite departed from our company to return her bounty, and so the five of us continued on East toward a Halfling village. Another hour had barely transpired when we were engulfed in light. I remember freezing, standing as still as I could. When the light dissipated, we found ourselves in a grand room.\n\nIn a moment I knew where I was. We were in Bahamut’s home! This knowledge was given me once my eyes rested upon the Platinum Dragon. Granted he was in a mortal disguise, but from what I learned in school, it was undeniably Him! Immediately I dropped into a low curtsy, averting my eyes, and waiting to be acknowledged to rise.\n\nBahamut greeted us warmly before inquiring about the cup. Though it wasn’t surprising to me how he knew we had it, skepticism was had by the others. The Platinum Dragon then revealed a sleeping Gizmo nearby. Oh how close Sugalite was to seeing her mother.\n\nAfter showing that we did indeed have the item in question, Bahamut mentioned how two have been secured now. Apparently there’s another group of adventurers who are going about finding the cups for him too.\n\n“So we need not to worry about finding more, right?” I blurted. It would have been better if I had kept that question to myself. Instead He revealed to us the important role we played in the grand scheme of things.\n\n“You five are the Primordials,” He told us with a bow. It was the strangest thing to see a God bow in respect to mortals. I had to wonder if He was mocking us. After some questioning, Bahamut explained that we, the five of us, governed the Gods.\n\nI must have looked so rude with my mouth hung agape. If that is the truth, I would out rank Heironious! Oh how my family would laugh!\n\nWe continued to question the validity of our supremeness. The Dragon then reminded us of our dreams, taking the time to walk each of us through them. The significance weighed heavily on my shoulders as I recalled mine. I was the Primordial of Balance. It made sense, at least the way I perceived things. Good and evil have their places. Without opposites, everything I value would hold no meaning. But, at the same time, with how chaotic my life currently is, it seemed impossible that I could balance anything.\n\n“Why, as Primordials, do we have to secure the cups?” I questioned.\n\n“Because you have the power to do so,” Bahamut replied.\n\n“What about the other group? They seem perfectly capable.”\n\n“Indeed. Yet they are the Elementals. Together I imagine both parties will expedite the mission.”\n\nBahamut went on to explain that there was an Order, the Order of the Empty Cups, whom we were to prevent from ever obtaining a cup. They also are hunting for us. The Order knows of the cups’ powers, hence why the Platinum Dragon wanted them, to make sure they weren’t used improperly. \n\nI still am unsure whether it’s wise to allow Bahamut to have all them, but one of the ideas presented was using the wish the ten cups generated to destroy them. That way no one could use them for good or evil.\n\nAlas, the questions seemed to flow from everyone of us as our Godly potential sunk in. I know it’s far too big for me to grasp currently, but Bahamut assured He’d answer all our questions in due time. First, He wanted to place the cup in His vaults for safekeeping.\n\nAnd so, we’ve sat a spell in Bahamut’s courts. Everyone’s kept to themselves for the most part, Bordel being the only one moving among us. Kimaris did poke at me for a bit, but he lost interest as I ignored him. I don’t know what I’m going to do with that boy...\n\nSo some questions that are sifting through my head currently are:\n\n* Why would I be one?\n* Are my parents Primordials? And,\n* How is it we all managed to be together?\n\nSeriously... I feel like I’m being tricked. However, I’ll fuss later. I can see Bordel making his way over.\n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻",

        "text": "I posted this story in /r/Rokugan and I think I'll post it too since you guys are a little bit more active and I enjoy reading your guys' stories.\n\n\nForeground: Someone mentioned writing up session end caps. I kind of like the idea so I'm stealing it. I like talking about game sessions but I'm a shit writer. Deal with it! I've also had about 2 weeks of looking into Rokugan so I'm new with the setting. I'll get things wrong. It will happen. That's why you get sincerity and etiquette, right?\nCharacter: My character is a Scorpion, Bayushi Bushi. (I must say all of my the other players just say family names.. I have no idea what they are talking about... Please say Mantis shugenga, plsss)\n\n\nSo my character. Bayushi Bushi. Air 3, Fire 3, Water 2, Earth 2, Void 2. I chose to ring out the Air because I intend to be a little investigatory and courtly. Fire 3 is because of Family and school starts. So i can be fighty. (3 directions might be pulling too much for a first character)\nSkills. Acting 1, Courtier (manipulation) 3, Defense 1 (*doubt), Iaijutsu 1, Kenjutsu 2, Etiquette 1, Sincerity 1, Investigation 1, Athletics 1, Calligraphy 1, Artisan (Umberella?) 1, Lore (underworld) 2\nAdvantages: Sage, Blissful betrothal, Wealth 3, imperial spouse, social position.\ndisadvantages: Insensitive, doubt (defense), contrary, and blackmail.\nSo I had a game already which gave some experience plus we did an ancestory, I got mixed.. 2 underworld lore in trade for blackmail ... I didn't want that.\nI really liked everything I read about scorpion. I also enjoyed the law aspect and loved that Scorpions invented a lot of it XD I aspire to be like Garak, however, I'm not that crafty. I'm pretty crafty but my DM knows me from forever, knows the system impossibly well, and is more crafty and devious than I am. uhh good luck to me.\n\nSo to the character description. I am Bayushi Kazo. I think Kazo is 3rd son or some shit I don't remember. I was a 3rd son, and as such will have little influence within the family. First come first serve's a bitch. So I became a Yoriki to an emerald Magistrate and found a Miya wife. It helped gain me status however I couldn't join the imperial clan so I had to keep the Bayushi Name. Our game will make us Jade Magistrates.. Makes my status equate to a 6.0 This is good as this makes my testimonals mean a lot. Honor of 2.5... so I'm shady, but I don't know how that influences it, since Samurai are still bound to status before Honor I believe. I know i won't be a master at court, but I intend to be able to move around, gain information in a court setting, and then advocate justice. As a Scorpion, I don't particularly care if this means that I'm \"planting\" evidence to get a conviction. I love insensitive and contrary. It forces me to roleplay in story provocative ways since I typically am polite, and analytical in my nature. I have to intentionally look like an asshole. As a scorpion, Compassion isn't really my Bushido Tenet anyways.\n\nOur party is as follows:\n\nMantis Shugenga.. A very courtly shugenga? I really don't understand this character at all, and her dangerous beauty and overall uppity acting.\nPheonix Loremaster.. A courtier? A huge Lore and overall studious librarian. She knows a lot, and is compassionate, but not a great adventurer I'd say. This will brush against my general inconsiderate character a lot. Very amusing to me, hope she isn't mad by it!\n\nA Lion Shugenga.. Blind. See's things I cannot, but relies on Sight that I would not normally think to give. Lead her around? She's in my party, I won't let her get lost, but I'm inconsiderate. Mostly it's the Phoenix who guides her. I remind the party greatly everytime we go somewhere, that I don't help her move around, it's just not something that occurs to my character on a regular basis. Status 6! Eat it \nXD XD\n\nWe also have a ... Dragon bushi ? He is rarely around to do anything (works a home-call center) and overall an inactive player.\nSo that's our Dynamic. I seem to be the Courtier/Conversationist, Leader, and possibly main combatant (I didn't want these primary roles in my first attempt at L5R but oh well!)\n\nHook: I awake in a dream state. I awake to a buzzing sound. (test sage: it's a dragon fly) I'm in a room, with no windows and no doors. The floor and roof are aged badly, the walls are pristine with writing I can't identify on the walls (failed sage) and an unsheathed tanto on a table in the middle. I'm wearing a white kimono. (Now it sounded like committing sepuku at first, but I know that you don't do that with a knife.) I examine the knife (fail sage). I then take it with me. I hear moaning outside. Instead of cautiously peeking outside, I just cut open a hole. (I won't timidly await an ambush!) I hear the moaning more clearly but nothing comes through.\n\nI move out through the hole. Outside, it's a house in a forest. In the forest are (sage roll) undead-zombies. They are moaning and moving away to a hill. They don't notice me. I'm curious to where they are going. I move stealthily to the hill. Over the hill there is a Green Dragon(sage failed), being attacked by zombies. The Dragon shapes into a human and starts fighting. I note that I cannot kill a zombie (sage roll success: Hard to kill, but a sufficient decapitation would work. At void 2, I cannot raise 3 to target the head). This is a fight that I cannot help. I flee when 2 zombies notice and start to come at me. Dream ends.\nI get summoned the next couple of days by letter to join the Jade Palace for a meeting. I say my goodbyes to my wife, pack my things and go.\nI meet the other players at the gatehouse. I introduce myself one on one. (I learn later, Samurai just announce themselves loudly. Whoops- I dont' know!) Blind girl Shugenga plays an instrument. Mantis Shugenga has a dependent child and ignores everyone. Dragon player is overall nonresponsive. Loremaster is drawing a mon on a knife that she couldn't identify from her dream (I couldn't either.) I strike up conversation but it fails &gt;_&gt;\n\nWe then meet the Jade champion. The loremaster talks about her dream. I chime in with the identifying marks that I know (contrarian) and even get to give some details the others didn't have, since I actually went outside. I get to grin under my mask as the loremaster experienced seppuku with a knife, but first identified that the dream was in a different realm. Something with a U ( i don't have my campaign notes or even char with me atm) The wall writings were wards from evil, and if you poke a hole in a wall, a peeping spirit eye peeks in. The Blind Shugenga gets to tell us that the tanto, was a numenari(?) with a spirit of duty. I never told my full story, specifically saying that the dream ended after the green dragon turned into a man to fight the zombies. The Jade champion says that the dragon was the Jade Dragon. {With shame hidden under my mask, I think about how I retreated with a knife, with a spirit of Duty, while the Jade dragon was being attacked... and I'm now at the Jade Palace with the Jade Champion. &gt;_&lt; I also didn't know anything about dragons in Rokugan, why would I think before hand that I even needed to defend such a thing)\n\nI'm designated leader of a jade magistrate group as is proper since I have Status. The mission we are given is a strange occurance. A province has something unusual going on. An Imperial Herald, and once before that a Cran clan assessor went to the Province to check on their imperial tithes/tax. They do adequate grain production, but never-more, never-less. The Assessor and herald and their retinue however never return, save for one Yojimbo that was told to wait outside of the shiro. The province later sends out a message with normal tithe, and says that they are meeting quotas and expected, will guard their lands from banditry as always, and that the Herald and Assessor have chosen to stay within the western wing of the shiro. ya-da-ya-da-ya-da. Ever vigilante, as always since the founding of the clan 60 years ago.\n\nThe assigner notes that the family (Yamamoto of the Crane) was founded to that territory over 300 years ago. (Hey that's pretty cool. So.. Whoever wrote that letter, has no idea how long it's been. Plus the whole not letting people leave thing)\n\nI give the group 3 days before we set out. (I figure 3 days is fine enough to send out letters to take care of change of stations, family, daimyo, prepare for a large journey) I write letters to my previous magistrate, to my wife, to the daimyo of my territory, and letters to each of my party members for the gathering date-place. To make a gift to give to the Yamamoto, I make an umbrella (my first! tn-20) with Crane (their clan) colors and come up with a story involving the umbrella. My equipment is my Diasho, sturdy clothing, katagiri? clothing, a no-Dachi (?), 2 masks. (My everday &amp; courtier mask is a 75% cover. Decorative metal. I also wanted an investigator mask, A full face Tengu. I chose large facial coverage as I intend to possibly act/disguise outside of my mask without being identified) Bedding, Food, water, tanto for grooming. personalized chopsticks, Chop/seal, and sake cup. Before I leave, I also research information regarding the state of the empire 300 years ago. I wanted to be prepared for a conversation of the empire, to avoid time-faux pas. (I remember the Scorpions were banished at some point, and also we killed an emperor...) Apparently at the time period, the Unicorn had just joined the empire, and the Lion clan was pissed. I should have noted the residing emperor's name but that only donned on me just now. Thankfully though, the Scorpions didn't seem to have any negatives, so I was happy so see that.\n\nMy party members go into the nearby city of the palace and purchase Kimono, hair pin, tea set. (A considerate man might have helped them, my character is not that. I figure they should have the awareness to do it themselves.)\n\nWe meet up on the day and set out. As we get closer to the province I investigate with my hosts that we stay with, inquiring about the province, unusual things ... apparently no one goes there, but think they had a cousin or something that lived there or moved there. Only vague-half remembered things about distant family.\nWhen we get to the province, I announce myself, but we are never really greated until we get to a village head-peasant Saijo. I get a roof for everyone, and obviously take the best room (as is proper) and talk with the Head-peasant. (not his position mind you.. like a mayor ish? I dunno I just call him Saijo.) Inquire about visitors (extremely few), ask about samurai of the province (only one... but he's from the Temple of Ebitu(?)) I ask for directions. (Rest of the party does .. squat.. Seriously! It's all me for like an hour plus) We get to the temple, but it's the fortune of hard work, so go figure, it's hard work to get there. I would have passed but I'm in my armor, so I struggle with the rest. When we get to the top, most of us are exhausted. I lay down my mat (Tashimi?) and rest on that. The blind one sits in the dirt, and the loremaster kind of face-plants and sleeps in the dirt. I note, that I watch the passage and check that no one is in danger. I make special note that I don't help the loremaster, while I sit on top of my mat. (I'm insensitive! While I could optionally help her or put her on the mat or something, I'm inconsiderate, it doesn't cross my mind.) The abbot comes by, and gives food and tea to my companions, but not to me (I pay no mind to that. It's the fortune of hard work. Obviously I already have the fortune's blessing in this matter and they are the needy). Once we get some adequate rest, the loremaster wakes up and complains. I note that it's rude to touch another. (She thinks this isn't reason enough to not take care of her.. What, she's not dead)\n\nI then pack up my mat, and go to see the samurai that is working in the gardens. I try to help with some artisan horticulture (go void point! and get like a 13.. not so great eh?) I talk with the Samurai Yamamoto Hideyo. I inquire how long he's worked with the shrine, with Saijo who'm we've both met, visitors, and the rest of the family. Apparently the yamamotos have a single line that is dedicated to living and maintaining the shrine, and don't do any other duty regarding the Yamamotos. They don't visit the shiro, see the other samurai, or anything really. I learn of a Ronin that came asking similar questions, particularly about family history, claiming he wanted to join the Yamamoto family about 10 years back. (It paints to me that the Yamomoto head family is even more isolationist than should be reasonable. I figure it's rude to directly inquire about the family, particularly since Hideyo was born, raised, and serves the shrine, never comming into contact with the Yamamoto.)\n\nThe other members commune with spirits. (These events they probably won't tell me, though when we meet next I'll tell them all of my investigation thus far) A fire-kami tells the Mantis Shugenga (who will probably tell no one at all) that they had a notable visitor, with air kami always around, used to visit them regularly but hasn't come in 500 seasons (125 years).. Omnious but that doesn't really mean anything. Could have died of old age. What is this, chekov's gun? Is everything supposed to be relevant? lol.. I digress. The blind-shugenga and Loremaster, talk to the Abbot and see some record books. 300 years ago they used to have a larger involvement with the shrine, but the family split up. One line to look after the original shrine, the other built Shiro yamamoto and foresee the province. There was an agreement in which the shrine line would not go to the estate, to keep it seperate, that way they won't be tempted to leave the original shrine. The loremaster finds in a visitor log, a brief description of the activities of the \"Air kami shouded visitor\" from 125 years ago. Would visit monthly, help with small shrine duties, and talk with the abbot. Again, to me out of character, this might have a tie-in, but the information is actually nothing. The odd letter-report was miss-dated by 200+ years)\n\nAnd this is where we leave off. Until Next time :D\nplease give me all thoughts, I welcome the opportunity to develop my character more, possibly by answering questions of why I chose to do what I did. I don't really want incite into the presumably-horror mystery i'm walking into as I want to tackle those challenges on my own, however any comment as to how to better act within the world of Rokugan because the overall setting is new to me is greatly appreciated.\n\n*For all likeness to real (and Rokugan cannon) places, events, names, and people, note that it's just in name only.",

        "text": "Hello again. This is a continuation of 'What we are in the Shadows Part 5 (The Thor Effect), which you can find here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/489osb/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_5_the/. Last time, our intrepid team had successfully sabotaged an industrial power station on the outskirts of Auckland. Their triumph was short-lived as Hautangi was caught in the blast, an electrical explosion that knocked the con-man into a coma. He came around several days later, using his recently awakened magical abilities to choke Poindexter. The large Maori came to his senses moments before suffocating his friend. That is where we find ourselves at the moment.\n\nHautangi stared at the collapsed form before him, squinting to try and clear his vision. Benjamin sucked in tremendous lungfuls of air as his skin slowly returned to a shade approaching normalcy. The door to Hautangi's room slammed against the wall, thrown open as Leilani and Nellie burst inside. The veterinarian swept her rifle across the room, trying to identify any threats. Nellie was decidedly less pragmatic, her gaze swiveling from Hautangi to Poindexter. Her voice was shrill, an unfortunate side-effect of sleep deprivation and frayed nerves.\n\n\"What the fuck happened!?\" Asking what was quickly becoming the favored question for the group, Nellie stood with her hands balled into tiny fists. Leilani lowered her weapon, having cleared the room of any threats. \n\n\"Kind of wondering that myself. Hautangi?\" The grifter stared at her groggily, his newly-conscious brain managing to comprehend the potential danger in the rifle-woman's tone. \"What the hell happened to Poindexter?\" Running through every potential response that he could offer, Hautangi eventually settled for the truth.\n\n\"I don't fucking no.\" His speech was slurred, his mouth dry. \"I just woke up and fatty was lying on the floor, choking on air.\" Nellie knelt by the cab driver's side as his breathing slowed. Leilani glared suspiciously at the convalescing Maori, her grip tightening on the rifle. \"Don't give me that fucking look! I came round and Ben was turning blue. How is that my fault?\" Their intense staring match was interrupted by a rasping voice.\n\n\"Your hand was glowing.\" All eyes turned to Poindexter, the flabby man having regained his breath. \"I came in to check on you and your hand was glowing. I called out and you pointed at me, like you were trying to choke me.\" His expression was torn between terrified and hurt, one hand rubbing worriedly at his throat. Nellie gasped quietly, her eyes widening in understanding. Leilani hissed through her teeth and anxiously ran a hand through her hair. Hautangi was the only one not to have realized the conclusion that his partners had reached. \n\n\"Bullshit. That's like, fucking magic and shit!\" His voice was full of scorn, his eyes narrowed. Leilani scoffed in disgust and started pacing across the room while Poindexter averted his gaze. It was Nellie who spoke up.\n\n\"Yeah, jack-ass. Magic. You awakened, you stupid fuck.\" Hautangi blinked at her, uncomprehending. \n\n\"Fuck off. You have to be born with magic and shit, even I know that.\" The event planner rolled his eyes at his lack of knowledge, her hand clutched like a claw on Ben's shoulder. Poindexter winced and tried to free himself but her grip tightened as she spoke.\n\n\"No, you don't. People develop their magic at some point in their life, they aren't born shooting lightning bolts or summoning spirits. They awaken during times of extreme stress, like puberty or when the body suffers greatly. Like you did.\" Her tone became matter-of-fact, as if Nellie had given this speech a hundred times before. \n\n\"But I've already gone through puberty...\" Hautangi trailed off, the little light bulb that was his brain finally clicking on. \"Holy shit, I've got magic powers!?\" His confusion evaporated at the sheer intensity of his excitement, the confidence man sitting bolt upright. Nellie made a guttural grunt of revulsion, throwing her hands in the air. Ben took the opportunity to stand up, waddling away from his captor. Leilani pinched the bridge of her nose, eyes clenched close. It was Ghost that answered. The group turned to him in surprise; no-one had seen or heard him come in.\n\n\"That's right. You've got magic powers and we have a whole host of new problems.\" The shadowrunner frowned at the joyous Hautangi, slowly shaking his head. \"You've got an astral presence now. You'll be that much harder to hide from A.L.E, even with Chrissie. Now the team has to try and factor in whatever fucked-up abilities you're going to develop. On top of that, you almost killed Poindexter.\" Ghost stalked over to the bed-side, fluorescent lights burning his silhouette over Hautangi. \"So stop your goddamn giggling and get out of bed, moron. You've got your very own special training to do.\" Momentarily frightened into silence by the looming mercenary, Hautangi cleared his throat and smiled weakly.\n\n\"Yay?\" The next few weeks flew by in a training montage right out of the 80's: While everyone else was continuing their studies and exercises, the recently awakened Mystic Adept was forced into long periods of introspection. Meditation, mental drills and rigorous bouts of concentration were his new regime. As the others climbed through the scaffolding of the barn and sparred together, Hautangi sat cross-legged with a look of constipation on his face. Suffice to say, Hautangi was whining at every possible moment. The only thing that shut him up was the fact that he was actually getting results: the invisible force that had choked Poindexter could be directed in many different ways. These 'Magic Fingers' were proving to be incredibly useful, from anything to retrieving the last bacon flavored soy-pack to slapping Leilani on the ass and blaming Benjamin. Knowing that the panicking cab-driver would never have the testicular fortitude to do so, she took her anger out on the still recovering Hautangi. \n\nThough the barn's atmosphere had become tense, things slowly began to return to normal. It was during this time, of course, that Ghost reappeared. With his customary case of beers in tow, their mentor sat wordlessly at the meeting table while they chattered with each other. Nellie was the only one to notice his atypical silence, the event planner growing paranoid the longer he remained still. The others continued to converse for some time, groaning at a tasteless joke, before she erupted. \n\n\"What the fuck is it?\" Her teammates reared back, unprepared for the auditory assault. Ghost sighed, sucking at his teeth. He nodded once before doffing his wide-brimmed hat. The face beneath was bland, almost generic, though there was a certain edge to his otherwise soft features. Ghost's hat hit the table with a soft sound as the man himself considered how to breach the topic. Nellie grew even more paranoid, her finger-tips tapping out a staccato beat across the cheap plastic surface. \"Jesus, Ghost. Just tell us what's going on. Why are you so quiet? What are we doing?\" \n\n\"Got your next job. It could be worse.\" His words, though obviously intended to set them at ease, put everyone on edge. Ghost winced, interlacing fingers behind his head. \"You're going to ruin one, maybe two people's lives in order to further our goals and you don't get to know what you're doing this for.\" He braced himself for the typical explosion of outrage. When nothing of the sort happened, Ghost looked curiously at his protegees. \"Kind of expected more yelling. You guys alright?\" Leilani shrugged noncommittally while the boys chugged their beer. Nellie relaxed, her body uncoiling as she smiled.\n\n\"Yeah, we're okay. I guess I was just worried.\" Ghost shook his head, confused.\n\n\"Actually, I meant the fact that no-one even blinked at the whole 'ruining lives' thing.\" Hautangi belched loudly, forcing a laugh from Poindexter. Leilani rolled her eyes before focusing on Ghost.\n\n\"Last time you had a job for us, we blew up a power station. We've been framed for terrorism, shoved in a hole for a month, locked in a barn and been terrified of some black ops assassination group. I think I speak for all of us when I say, we don't care anymore.\" Ghost looked around at the agreeing faces and grinned.\n\n\"I guess you kids might make it after all. Okay, let's have a look at the details.\" The mercenary plugged a data stick into their trid projector. Information appeared in a flash of emerald light, one of the walls covered in a hologram. \"This is Carol Mercer, an IT agent with A.L.E. Somehow, we have to convince her to do something for us when the time is right. Sadly, Carol is an upstanding member of society so she'll need a little bit of incentive to follow through. That's where you guys come in.\" Ghost leaned forward, his face once more obscured by the brim of his hat. \"Any ideas?\" \n\nFast-forward two weeks. Auckland has many naturally beautiful zones, even with mega-corporation involvement and mass urbanization. One such area is Myers Park, a 24-hour jogging track and picnic spot for everyone in Auckland to enjoy. It was also filled with a great deal of isolated sections for illicit rendezvous' between couples; such as the one currently occurring. Dressed in the professional garb of an A.L.E employee, Carol Mercer was in a decidedly unprofessional position: Arms intertwined with her partner as the two exchanged tender touches. While both of them ached to escalate things to the next level, they pulled back reluctantly. \n\n\"By the Lord, I wish we had time.\" His voice was smooth, shaken only by the lust boiling in his veins. Exchanging longing looks with Carol, the man sighed explosively. \n\n\"I know, Donald. Believe me, I know, but we cannot risk anyone finding out about us. It would jeopardize everything. I'm afraid that this will have to be the end, darling.\" Though her tone was strict, there was an undercurrent of regret to Carol's words. She stroked his face once before pulling back. The two of them began to straighten their clothes, spraying deodorant to disguise their scents on each other. \"Unless, I mean, I've already booked the a hotel room for two days. I would be very lonely, holed up there with no-one to talk with.\" Her voice dripped with blatant eroticism, a far cry from her usual behavior. This was her weakness, a soft-spot in her otherwise hardened persona. \n\n\"I truly cannot wait, my sweet. I shall endure through these tortuous times, the thought of your tender embrace a bulwark against the pain.\" A flush ignited across Carol's face, the normally stoic woman moved by the obnoxiously romantic words. Her partner sighed, re-buttoning his collar and striding out of the concealed thicket that they shared. Carol watched as he left, her heart fluttering in her chest. As the IT specialist smoothed out her skirt, a young woman jogged past with a slight grin on her face. Once she rounded a corner on the walking path, the runner came to a stop. Stretching her lithe muscles in tantalizing ways, Nellie spoke quietly into her comm-link.\n\n\"Did everyone get that?\" Back down the path, Poindexter smiled. The overweight man sat on a park bench with a newspaper covering his face. His cheap-suit clad frame took up a greater than necessary portion of the seat but it was necessary to cultivate the image of a dozing wage-slave. His sweat-soaked form was a disservice to anyone trying to enjoy the day, drawing prying eyes away from the small recording device loosely covered in one grimy paw. \n\n\"Got it. Cheeky buggers, aren't they?\" On the other-side of the thicket, Hautangi laughed silently to himself. Dressed in overalls and armed a rake, the large Maori looked like nothing so much as the stereotypical grounds-keeper. He was performing his duties with an admirable determination, raking leaves across the grass into ever-growing piles. It was such an average sight that one could be forgiven for missing the thin directional camera/microphone strapped to the handle of the rake. Once Carol had hurried from her hiding place, Hautangi finally allowed himself to laugh uproariously.\n\n\"That was fucking priceless. Haven't seen something that funny in weeks, not since the Fat Man tried doing chin-ups.\" As Poindexter pouted angrily, a figure dropped down from a tree near the thicket. Loose forest pattern camouflage clothing wrapped around Leilani's frame as the veterinarian began packing away her equipment. Perched in a tree with a tally-book of local bird life and a pair of binoculars, she had looked like nothing more than a bird-watching enthusiast. Few people would have suspected that those same binoculars contained sophisticated recording software.\n\n\"Shut up, asshole. Everyone send me your feed so I can splice this shit together. Start heading out, one at a time. N, you're going to have to get dressed in something nicer.\" Nellie chuckled lightly to herself, enjoying the attention that other joggers were paying her. She clicked the heart-rate monitor on her arm, sending her footage from the disguised equipment to Leilani. Already, the event planner was deciding what to wear for her outing later that evening. The team reconnoitered with Chrissie in their van and headed back to the barn. A few hours of digital editing, one change of clothes and a great deal of make-up later, Nellie was ready. Carol had just finished her shift at Auckland A.L.E. Precinct Twelve and was walking to her car when a beautiful young woman approached her.\n\n\"Miss Mercer? Carol Mercer?\" The IT specialist frowned at her, irritated to be wasting anymore time.\n\n\"Yes? Who's asking?\" Carol had little patience for people at the best of times, which this was certainly not. \"I'm afraid I don't have time for whatever you're selling. Good evening.\" As she turned to walk away, her own voice came from behind her. \"I know, Donald. Believe me, I know, but we cannot risk anyone finding out about us. It would jeopardize everything. I'm afraid that this will have to be the end, darling.\" The recording was of crystal clear quality, Carol's voice unmistakable to anyone who had met her. The lady in question had gone very pale, trembling in place.\n\n\"Seducing a man of the cloth, Miss Mercer? I have to admit, I'm almost proud. The fact that he's married is just a cherry on top. I can't imagine what would happen to both of you, to your reputations, if this got out.\" Carol turned on her heel, marshaling her resolve. The woman before her had a small trid player nestled in her hand, displaying her illicit meeting from earlier today. If she had not been so terrified, she might have appreciated the artful way that the video employed multiple angles.  Drawing herself to her full height, Carol growled at the voyeur.\n\n\"Do you have any idea who I am?\" Her threat fell short as the woman laughed quietly at her.\n\n\"Of course I do. That's why this is happening.\" Nellie leaned forward, her breath warm against Carol's face. \"This is the deal. You will be contacted when the time arises. You will be given a task that you will complete without question. If you try to contact anyone about this, I release the video. I don't want to do that and you don't want me to do that.\" The blackmailer pulled back, smiling her shark-tooth smile at the IT specialist. \"Once this is done, the footage will be deleted and you can go about your life. No-one gets hurt and you get to continue your lovely tryst.\" She craned her head in an uncanny valley way, her gaze holding Carol's with a disconcerting intensity. \"Do we have a deal?\" With no options left and her threats falling short, Carol Mercer had but one choice.\n\n\"Yes.\" Nellie inclined her head in acknowledgement and gave a small wave.\n\n\"Fantastic news. Do try to have a good night and try not to worry about this. I'm sure things will work out after all.\" Hearing the dismissal in Nellie's voice, Carol turned stiffly and walked to her car. The fledgling shadowrunner watched her go with a vindictive pleasure, enjoying the power she had over the woman. Once Carol was safely away, Nellie returned to the van and slipped inside. She grinned at Poindexter and leaned back in her seat. \"Alright chauffeur, I think we're done here. You can take me home now.\" Tipping an imaginary cap towards her, Ben accelerated away slowly and began the long trip back to the barn. Once there, the team reconvened with Ghost. The mercenary openly laughed as he watched the recording, deriving entertainment from the overly-romantic duo.\n\n\"That is amazing!. I'll admit, I didn't think you could pull this off. Glad to see I was wrong.\" Ghost inclined his head towards a case of beer on the table, accompanied by some steaming fast-food courtesy of Stuffer Shack. \"Dig in. You've certainly earned it.\" \n\n\"Fuck yeah, that's what I'm talking about!\" As the team gathered around the veritable bounty of hideously unhealthy treats, Ghost strolled towards the barn door. He stopped at the precipice and turned to the group with an almost forlorn expression on his face. The hired gun pulled his hat down across his face and sighed. They legitimately seemed happy for the first time in a long while, riding high after their latest success. Ghost grimaced to himself and closed the barn door behind him when he left muttering darkly.\n\n\"Enjoy it while it lasts, kids. The good times are over.\" ",

        "text": "This takes place in a fantasy universe, where demons have begun to reappear after being mostly hunted and destroyed, and the king's bastard has gone on the run from the castle. There's now a massive bounty on his head, which the party is hunting. The world is divided into two main kingdoms: the United in the West, and the Holy Empire in the east. They're heading across the border, following the runaway bastard. \n\nThe party is made up of:\n\n&gt;Myself as DM\n\n&gt;The same player who played the paladin in the DragonSlayers campaign, who is now playing \"Unname Untame\"; naive squirrel cleric whose parents abandoned her in the woods to be raised by squirrels. \n\n&gt;A generic fighter\n\n&gt;An edgy dragonborn sorcerer whose clan was killed by its patron dragon. \n\n&gt;A generic sorcerer\n\n&gt;A Dwarven nobleman\n\n&gt;A scummy rogue\n\nSo the party was chasing the fleeing bastard, starting from a port town and making their way to a merchant camp; their trip so far uneventful except for a chance run in with a troll being eaten by a slime. In the merchant camp, the owner offered them horses if they'd check in on a lost flock of sheep and gave him a small amount of credit if they found the bastard. The party was glad to accept, as it meant they could be much faster in catching their runaway reward. As they come across the path to the meadow where they're held, the party fighter notices footprints in the ground. Sadly, he's unable to identify them as anything more than sheep. When they arrive in the meadow, they notice a glowing red light coming from the forest. Unname decides that it's pretty, so she wanders towards it. There, she sees many sheep in various states of demonic corruption, all inside a gate to hell opened by a man with horns wearing living armor and holding a contract that appears to have been signed by the sheep. He then presses paper into a tree and disappears, leaving the party with some very aggravated and corrupted sheep.\n\nUnname proceeds to get mauled by multiple sheep on the first turn, being brought down to a single health with multiple poisons ticking down on her health for next turn. Unwilling to hit the animals, she heals herself instead. The rest of the encounter runs very smoothly for everyone but her, who managed to fail every constitution check for resisting poison and not land a single hit on the demon sheep the entire time. \n\nAfter, one sheep remains inside the gate. The entire time it hasn't been moving, but rather twitching and gathering blood from the fallen sheep which nobody noticed through their perception checks. Unname, who still believes these sheep can be reasoned with, walks up and rolls to speak with the animal.\n\n&gt;Nat 20 + 5\n\n&gt;He throws his hands in the air irl. \"Finally I get some luck!\"\n\n&gt;He is now inside the mind of an ageless demon who has existed before time\n\n&gt;I look at him, laughing my ass off. \"Roll for sanity, just a d20 + wisdom\"\n\n&gt;1\n\n&gt; \"You are alone in the void.

        "text": "I admit that this one relies as much on the delivery as the setting, but it was by far the most memorable experience for me in our campaign, to date. Maybe because I enjoyed scaring the crap out of my players for once, but it ended up being creepier than anything I had tried to cook up before. This may be familiar to those of you who read r/DnD, but since a friend reminded me of it, I thought the rest of you would appreciate this, too.\n\n**The Undisturbed Tomb**\n\nIn the game I run the party had to infiltrate a ruined keep that had been taken over by a gang of bandits. While looking for a good way in, the party stumbled upon a secret passage that led to an underground chamber. A door in the far wall looked like a normal metal door from this side, but once they walked through it they saw that the other side was disguised to match the stone walls of the crypt beyond. While looking around, the party accidentally let the hidden door slam shut. In a panic, they tried to open the door again. None of them was able to find the secret latch. Since my players are pretty new to D&amp;D, only one of them had a torch to supplement Wizard's mage light. Wizard made an Arcana check to see if anything magical was nearby, and I relay that everything around him seemed suffused with a dim glow, as if everything were faintly magic, or had been touched by magic. It had them pretty worried, but since the crypts had to connect to the keep, which was their target anyway, they decided to press on.\n\nI described for them in great detail how the skeletons and cloth-wrapped bodies lay in hollows carved into the walls. Spider webs covered the alcoves, and a fine gray dust covered everything. As they walked, I described how their feet kicked up swirls of powder and disturbed the perfect coating that had lain on the floor. At every step my players expected the corpses to rise and attack. But they didn't. I did, however, ask them to roll perception checks. To the player with the highest roll I passed a note saying he thought he heard a distant sound of wind... or was it moaning?\n\nThey got to the end of the chamber and found a statue, carvings, and candelabra-style candle holders with half-consumed candles. The statue was a knight with an engraving on the shield in a language none of them recognized. They expected it to animate and attack, but despite being prodded by Wizard's staff it never moved. I told them that everything was dead, unchanging, unmoving down here. Even the air hardly stirred with their passing, which explained why the fine, gray dust coated everything perfectly and uniformly. Another note to the same player. Did something move at the far end of the room, just beyond the torch light?\n\nThere were two sets of stairs leading down. The players chose the ones to the right of the statue. They were getting fairly paranoid now. One player volunteered to scout ahead with his torch. I described how the rank air assaulted his nostrils as he descended. The torch light took an ever-so-faintly green tinge. I watched the player's breathing speed up as I described the PC's heartbeat becoming more rapid. More fine, gray dust. He stepped off the bottom stair... and felt a tug on his cape!\n\nThe PC failed to hold onto the torch as he wheeled around, and it snuffed itself out on the ground when it fell top-down. The PC cried for help and flailed his sword around, hoping for at least a chance to blindly strike his assailant. The rest of the party charged down the stairs at the cry, but when they got there all they found was the volunteer breathing heavily with a fresh, self-inflicted sword wound.\n\nWith no immediate crisis, the group investigated the room. It was a small Hall (like in a castle, not a suburban home). A rectangular stone container/basin ran down the center of the hall from the end with the door to a dais at the opposite end. It must have been a fountain or pool of some kind. It was mostly dry, but there was some foul-smelling green ooze in the bottom of it in patches. Wizard burned the ooze. Just in case.\n\nThe dais held two sarcophagi - the paired lids had carved images of a Lord and Lady in repose. The party wizard, thinking the Lord might have been buried with sweet magic items, convinced the barbarian to help him slide the lid back. It opened just enough for the freshly-relit torch to spill light onto the withered husk of the Lord depicted on the lid of the sarcophagus. Wizard poked the face and waited for a reaction. Nothing. So he said he reached inside.\n\nI had been purposefully talking quieter and quieter as they went toward the coffin end of the room. It helped that the room we were playing in was dark except for the light over the table, and there were no sounds but those of the gaming group. I described Wizard reaching his hand in, myself leaning toward the player. Everyone is leaning toward me. Then I ask how exactly he is reaching in. The player holds his hand up to gesture, but instead of letting him talk I suddenly reach out and grab his hand! Something is grabbing his hand! Make a Strength check to pull away! He rolls... it's enough (anything but 1, actually).\n\nThis is it! The monster fight! But no monsters climb out of the coffins. They look inside again, and the dried husk is still resting peacefully. Wizard gets a nice dagger for his trouble.\nThe party has had enough, and since this is a dead end (heh heh), they walk back through the fine, gray dust that coats the floor. They climb the stairs and actually huddle around the knight statue and candle holders (which they have lit--a childish gesture to ward off the evils of the dark) while they debate whether to go back and look for the hidden door release or try the second stairway. Another note to the perceptive player. A fine, gray dust coats the floor of this room...\n\nThe player sits up straight in his chair and says, \"Guys... the dust.\" After a moment they realize what he means. The dust is perfect--not disturbed by their passing in the slightest. Paranoia takes its full grip. They huddle together and inch back toward the secret door. More attempts to locate the latch... failed. Barbarian loses his cool and starts smashing the skeletons where they lie. A few of the others join in. Soon all the skeletons are smashed, they are all catching their breath, and the door remains closed. There is nothing to do but head into the second stairwell.\n\nAs they reach the Knight end of the room again, the last player in the marching order turns around and holds the torch up to survey the room. The crypt is still and quiet. Skeletons and cloth-wrapped bodies lie in hollows carved into the walls. Spider webs cover the alcoves, and everything is coated in a uniform layer of fine, gray dust...\nHe turned and quickly followed his companions.\n\nAt this point we ended the session due to time, and because that was really the extent of this part of the crypt (I had planned for them to just use it as a shortcut into the keep--the creepy stuff just arose from room descriptions and my own desire to introduce small mysteries that would just go unsolved). I would have loved to keep going, since I knew the mood would be gone next time, but life is life. We all had work the next day. I did feel a real sense of accomplishment as a DM, though, for having sent the players into brown-pants mode without a single monster showing its face for the entire session.\n\n---\n\nAnd for those of you who want the \"real explanation\" behind the tomb:\nThe crypt really was the burial place of the noble family who owned the keep. The lord who had it built, however, added some extra touches: a secret passage in case he ever needed to escape the keep, an enchantment to re-set the bones and dust to hide the evidence of his passing, and a few minor tricks to keep enemies paranoid about going into the tomb in the first place. The sarcophagus of the noble lady was a secret passage shortcut into the keep, but the party never risked finding out.",

The Goliath gives people nicknames, such as Treecleaver for the fighter, and these nicknames are subject to change. The party was exploring a cave recently abandoned by the Cult of the Dragon, in which the cult had left dragon eggs. \n\nThe party have cleared out most of the cave with little trouble, with only a small section down a set of stairs to explore. \nThe fighter, who really functions a stealthy bow-wielding assassin, has been scouting out the area, and heard the words of some kobolds and lizardmen complaining about their duties towards the back of the cave, and having reported it to the party, they decide to try to sneak down and surprise them. Off go the fighter, followed by the wizard and the cleric, with the barbarian and warlock further back discussing something in the previous room.\nBut alas, the dwarf rolls a Nat 1 on his stealth check, and proceeds to not only be loud, but to trip and roll down the stairs in his heavy armour, and land nicely on top of the fragile elf wizard.\nThe kobolds are suddenly alarmed and rush to the sounds, to spot this elf-dwarf concoction in a heap on the floor. \n\nThese kobolds are armed with fire and glue bombs.\n\nSo this pile of PCs is now no fire and stuck to the ground, and while the rest of the party summarily execute the kobolds, these two eventually detach from each other, and while the wizard is able to put the flames on herself out, all that cumbersome heavy armour is keeping the dwarf roasting efficiently. \nNobody in the party has any water, but the Goliath barbarian has an epiphany: \"I do have some water, in my bladder\", and proceeds to piss all over the cleric to try to put out the flames. It doesn't take the cleric long to realise what's going on, and although he tries with all his effort to avoid this stream of piss, the Goliath is having none of it (rolling a Nat 20 to keep hitting the dwarf with the stream) and in a matter of seconds the flames are put out with only the fume of piss and the cleric's lost dignity floating around the chamber as a reminder of what just happened.\n\nThe Goliath barbarian decides it's time to give the dwarf a new nickname, and that's how he became known as Pissroller.",

The easiest and fastest way to describe it is with \"buzzwords\"; it is a post-apocalyptic, open world, open source, procedurally generated roguelike RPG with heavy simulation.

When in actuality CDDA pulls out all the stops and delivers on its premise amazingly well.

As well as plenty of new terrifying things added to the game over time.\n\nThe stories range from a terse, matter of fact depiction of the events, \"I drowned trying to avoid zombies.

        "text": "Welcome back to the curious tales of havoc and freakin' strange decision making that is my second campaign! For those of you just joining us, here's a quick recap of [what happened previously](https://redd.it/44ycl2).\n\n&gt; FUCKTARD: \"I attempt to do something that will almost certainly result in my spectacular death.\"\n\n&gt;DM: \"It results in your spectacular death.\"\n\nThe party consists of Ling Ling the Monkey-girl ranger, moral compass of the party, and her two \"children\": Nibbit the murderous suit of armor, and an unnamed slime that ate people and shoes. This unlikely trio was inhabiting a lovely little tree village, getting used to their new situation, when they were suddenly sent on a sidequest by the local druid. It basically amounted to, \"Hey, we saw weird stuff in a nearby tree, go see what's up\". Simple enough.\n\nThe party heads off and finds the tower, and more importantly, finds that it's chock-full of elves. Pompous, smug, better-than-thou motherfucking elves.\n\n&gt; Ling Ling: \"Let's kill them all.\"\n\n&gt; Nibbit: \"I thought you were the responsible one.\"\n\n&gt; Ling Ling: \"Are you really going to argue?\"\n\n&gt; Nibbit: \"No.\"\n\n&gt; Slime: \"I jiggle excitedly!\"\n\nAnd with that, they entered a fantastic tree-tower at the bottom and murdered their way all the way to the top. They found sissy elvish fighters and riddled them with arrows, they found smug-ass bards and cut them to pieces with a giant fuckoff axe, and they found foppish elvish rangers whose arrows did absolutely jack and shit to the hungry slime. The only real hiccup was when the slime decided to get a bit ahead of himself, climbed three floors up an empty shaft, and accosted a spellcaster at the top who was on alert and knew Grease. The fall damage nearly killed poor sir slime, but he recuperated by eating every dead body within a 100-meter radius.\n\nNear the middle of the tower, they found a strange prisoner- apparently some sort of half-elvish miscreant that had gotten captured for some possibly-imagined offense. He broke free during the party's attack and dispatched the distracted guard, then made a hasty alliance with the party. He introduced himself as Loki the \"ranger\" (rogue), and then proceeded to hit on Ling Ling, referring to her as \"M'lady\".\n\nThat didn't go over well. After a brief discussion of whether they should tie him back up or feed him to the slime, they eventually decided that this fedora-tipping jackass wasn't worth the trouble, and that he could join in their elf hunt. Provided that he stay 10 feet away from Ling Ling at all times. Nibbit latched onto this with great enthusiasm, and started enforcing the rules with more than a little evil glee. It got to the point where Nibbit would prioritize throwing Loki off of staircases instead of dealing with attacking enemies- not that there was anything to fear, Nibbit was basically a walking tank. Also, watching Loki sputter with indignation and bruised pride provided morale bonuses to the entire party. Well, maybe. They did seem to roll better when Loki was unhappy.\n\nAnyway, they reached the top of the tower and found the boss of the fearsome elvish forces- a well-armored cleric that looked to be some sort of nobility. The party asked no questions whatsoever and immediately threw down with her and her retainers. Seeing as everyone involved was low-level, it was a shitshow, with Ling Ling nearly dying to an arrow, Nibbit bisecting two people while taking flame magic to the face, the slime cowering behind the furniture as magic was hurled around, and Loki assisting with well-timed sneak attacks. Finally, though, the party resolved the business by sparta-kicking the cleric off the top of the tower, relishing the cartoonish whistling sound as she fell five stories while flailing indignantly. Unfortunately, they had neglected an important detail: there wasn't actually anything beneath the tower, and they had just kicked the handiest source of loot off the goddamn planet. Literally.\n\nWell, could be worse. The party looted the bodies, fed the bodies to the slime, picked through the loot, fed the loot they didn't want to the slime, picked through the tower, then fed the tower to the slime. At the very least, the slime was happy. Everyone headed home in good spirits, except for Loki, who kept getting evil looks from Nibbit.\n\nOn the way home, the party decided to name their pet slime. The only name they could decide on that DIDN'T result in the slime eating their footwear was Jello Shot. At least it was better than K-Y...\n\nSome time later, the town druid approached the party with another mission- to go raid some old crypt or other in pursuit of a magic doohicky that may or may not possess incredible power or drive you insane. Why not? The party geared up and headed out, with the druid in tow! Soon enough, they entered generic fantasy cave #192781... robot version.\n\nSee, the cave was guarded by a fleet of automatons. Specifically, shoddily-built clockwork minions. Well, maybe not all that shoddy, but they had been in this cave for a while, and were in desperate need of some maintenance. The party unanimously decided that these pathetic robots were too cute and helpless to wantonly murder, and Nibbit of all people decided to try diplomacy. The glitchy guard demanded an ID from Nibbit. Nibbit presented his battleaxe.\n\n&gt; Robot: \"...Credentials accepted.\"\n\n&gt; Loki: \"Damn, that was easy.\"\n\n&gt; Nibbit: \"Axes are always the answer.\"\n\n&gt; Jello Shot: \"I jiggle in confirmation.\"\n\nThe party journeyed on into the cave, the bemused druid in tow, as they encountered more and more malfunctioning robots. They were in such a state of disrepair that the party even took a few minutes to help them out, give them back their lost arms, shake off some rust, etc. Sadly not all was well in the cave, though, and a certain area had been overtaken by some pretty virulent fungus. The slime wobbled forward to put a stop to that business, ate a few fungus-possessed rats, then proceeded to trip balls.\n\n&gt; Jello Shot: \"I jiggle woozily.\"\n\nFurther in, the party encountered various other murderous land features, such as a fungal tarp that tried to eat Loki's face, and [the mysterious black poodle](http://outofcontextdnd.tumblr.com/post/137697845271/its-the-mysterious-black-poodle-dont-you-mean). Nothing presented too big of a threat, and watching Jello Shot engulf a much larger poodle-shaped slime was endlessly entertaining. The guest star druid helped out with occasional support spells, and by answering the incessant questions the party had about what the hell the magic artifact was, and why they needed it.\n\nThe basic story was, \"Nobody knows what the hell it's for, but it makes you hear weird voices in your head. It's said to drive people insane, and hold immense magical power. Whatever the case, we can't just leave it lying around unsupervised.\" Fair enough.\n\nThe party finally emerged into the final room of the cave dungeon- a rather better-maintained room with a sinister technological altar, a mysterious black orb on top, and oh yeah, a giant fucking golem with a scimitar that wanted to know what the hell the party was doing in \"unauthorized areas\". This time, Nibbit's axe-persuasion wasn't up to the task. So instead, Loki stepped in and employed his most powerful skill of all- rampant, unrelenting bullshit.\n\n&gt; Loki: \"We're not unauthorized. We've got every right to be here. We own the facility.\"\n\n&gt; Golem: \"You do not appear in my databases.\"\n\n&gt; Loki: \"Well, when was the last time your owner dropped by?\"\n\n&gt; Golem: \"47 years ago.\"\n\n&gt; Loki: \"See? Your owner abandoned you, and then sold the facility to us!\" *Rolls bluff. Natural 20.*\n\n&gt; Golem: \"...Access authorized.\"\n\nThe party immediately gave Loki a big round of applause for his quick thinking and disturbing skill at lying, then rushed forward to examine the mysterious black thing. Ling Ling grabbed it, and the first thing she heard was a faint whispering in her head of some distant voice, talking about how some vague thing was coming and that it was time to leave. That was confusing, but hardly insanity-inducing. After questioning the guardian golem, they learned that the cave-facility was indeed left for a new owner, and apparently, that new owner was the party. The artifact, according to the golem, was a \"communications device\" that it was to guard forever. The facility had fallen into disrepair when a glitch in the programming of the robots made them prioritize their patrols and tasks over maintenance, causing them to get caught in an endless loop of repeated failures. But they still didn't know who the hell made the artifact, what it did, or why.\n\nAt this point, the druid stepped up, grabbed the artifact, examined it carefully, and concluded that it was not what he was looking for. When the party asked what the hell the druid was talking about, POOF! Turns out the druid was actually a shapeshifter IMPERSONATING the druid! And also, the shapeshifter's apparent \"default\" form was that of an enchantingly beautiful dancer woman. Loki readied his smoothest moves before Ling Ling reflexively kicked him in the shin.\n\nAfter some interrogation, it turned out that the shapeshifter (who went by the name Shantalotte) had manipulated the party into finding the artifact in order to get some answers about her hazy past, because it did spooky plot things and so did she. But, discovering that the artifact wasn't all that it was cracked up to be, there was no need to hide forms anymore, and the party was welcome to have the artifact for their own. All in all, everyone was pretty okay with this, and Shantalotte was allowed to leave unharmed and on good terms.\n\nWith that, Shantalotte thanked them for their patience, commented on their odd approach to problem-solving, and gave them a free hint: Something very bad was about to happen in Ling Ling's hometown. With that, Shantalotte the shapeshifter pranced away, trailing strange music and glitter.\n\nThe party grabbed the artifact, instructed the robots in the facility to stop being stupid, instructed the giant honking golem to come with them, and headed off with great speed to find out what was going down back at home.\n\n[What happens next?

He doesn't hesitate at the opportunity to make a few more shills and lets us sit at the bar.\n\nThe 6'10\" Half-Orc Barbarian says \"Give me what you would give a man of my stature to get smashed\" The barkeep pulls a bottle out of the cabinet, pours him a drink, and the Orc pays 5sp.\n\nThe 5'8\" ish 1/4 Lycanthrope orders some whiskey and gets charged 5sp.\n\nI ask him \"What's the strongest stuff you'd give an elf?\" with a look of eager determination on my face.\n\nThe barkeep responds by pulling out a similar caliber drink to the one he served the Half-Orc. I glance at my Orc-friend's drink, glance at the bottle offered to me, grimace, and say \"stronger, please\" (At this point, the DM is telling me that it's probably not the best idea to try and outdrink the Orc)\n\nThe barkeep sighs, gives me a disclaimer stating \"I'm not responsible for what happens if you drink this\". I say \"bah!\" And ask him how much the whole bottle is worth to him. The barkeep is willing to sell the bottle of death-drink to me for 1 gp, considering the fact that nobody requests a drink of this caliber anyway. I buy the bottle.\n\nThe Orc then says to the barkeep: \"Hey Barkeep, have you ever been to an Orc Kegger??\" At this point, I can guess what's about to happen (even though he's a frail wizard, my Elf has been in plenty of bar fights), he sets 30gp on the counter in front of the barkeep, says \"3 rooms, no take-backsies!\" and runs upstairs. A bar brawl ensues, and after about a minute while everybody's distracted, I head back downstairs to observe the carnage. The Orc has managed to throw an unyieldy patron through a group of four's table, the rest of the bar is in an uproar watching the fight. The four patrons start attacking the nigh-invincible Orc.\n\nI glance over at the barkeep expecting a look of horror and confusion to satisfy me, but it was clear that he has seen much worse.\n\nSo, while everyone was distracted, I started pouring the death-booze I bought earlier in everybody's drinks. I made it to 10 patrons. Two turns into the barfight (which I joined at this point), I notice that the patrons are much drunker than usual. The barkeep at this point is rather confused because he wasn't seeing people drink more than usual, yet the usual patrons were rather rowdy.\n\nAt this point, I decide \"things aren't fun enough.\" For my turn, I cast Mage Hand, lift a pitcher of water over the lustiest wench with a thin top, and pour the water on her, soaking her top. There is a roaring caucophany of whoops and hollers, further augmented by the ever-rising inebriation of 10 lucky patrons. At this point, the barkeep is scrambling back and forth, trying to keep order to no avail.\n\nWhen the barfight finally settles down, the whole tavern is in silence at what just happened. Not a minute prior, one of the serving girls got soaked out of nowhere, exposing herself to the entire bar. There are 10 patrons on the floor passed out, some with vomit dribbling from their mouths, a few destroyed tables, several decimated pieces of glassware, and 6 knocked out challengers.\n\nI walk up to the defeated barkeep, leave him 50sp as a tip, and tell him to have a great night as I head up to my room to meditate.\n\nThe Orc walks up the barkeep and says, \"In a *real* Orc kegger, at least two people die.\" and goes to his room with the rest of my party.",

        "text": "So, I did get a comment asking me to keep going with the story (https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/489ala/5e_truly_the_best_most_skilled_and_most_noble/), so I will continue on with the combat that followed our antics finally finding the hidden cultists. See the link for character descriptions and such. This fight is much less hilariously terrible than the events preceding it, but still not exactly the proudest moment of the Best Heroes!\n\nOur heroes find themselves looking into an well-crafted chamber behind an ornate door [this demi-god creature the cultists worship inspires great creativity and artistry]. Mrs. Carver, who we are rushing to save, is trapped atop an altar, next to the corpse of her husband, Nolan [She does have a first name, too, I just can't remember it off the top of my head]. Nolan was a cultist who got cold feet and was killed in order to keep the ritual from being disrupted. Garn, the stonemason who we just found out was also a cultist, stands just behind the altar, while four other cultists (2 dwarves, 2 taller humanoids) stand between us and the altar. The dwarven cultists are just below the ridge of the elevated platform that houses the altar. The two taller cultists are each next to separate pillars that reach from this platform up to the ceiling. A glowing image of their Unformed God is flickering in and out of existence. This thing has an ever-shifting terrible visage which mainly looks like a horrid face in a gnarled tree, formed from the outlines of many men and beasts, all screaming in agony. Corresponding runes on the altar and the ceiling above it glow menacingly and appear to be draining the life from the victim. There's not much time left. Trevor finishes reciting his blessing just as Forsetti bashes the door open with his shield.\n\nAs the cultists begin to realize that violence is imminent, Ulaan looses an arrow straight at Garn. As it flies over the centre of the altar, it's stopped dead by some sort of forcefield and disintegrates.\n\nTrevor attempts to hit Garn with a Sacred Flame, but Garn dodges out of the way.\n\nThe two taller cultists throw their daggers towards Forsetti, who stands in the doorway. The first one, he easily deflects with his shield, the second one fails to even reach him and slides pathetically across the floor, stopping just in front of him [cultists immediate impulse was to throw their daggers, but they were still far enough away to be at disadvantage with their attacks].\n\nThe two Dwarven cultists were closer to the door, and charged at Forsetti with swords. Forsetti parries one, but that leaves him open to the other's attack.\n\nGarn carefully makes his way around the altar and casts some sort of tentacle shaped spell that appears by Ulaan and Deceit. It swipes and misses at Ulaan [not sure what spell this is specifically, or if it's even a normal spell, DM's obviously not gonna give up that info mid-battle without a skill check]\n\nForsetti doesn't let his wound go unanswered and slashes the cultist that struck him. Dirk charges up to the door to help, but misses on his attack.\n\nDeceit uses shatter near Garn and one of the taller cultists. [Garn passes his save but takes half damage just the same, the other cultist fails outright]. Garn is staggered slightly by the din, while his ally drops to his knee from the pain. They both shout some harsh words in Deceit's direction, Garn's words causing the tentacle to swipe at Deceit and wound her. Their shouting is curtly interrupted by a loud cracking sound. They have only enough time to exchange a brief worried glance as the column next to them collapses, and part of the ceiling caves in on top of them, killing the other cultist outright.\n\nUlaan quickly nocks and fires two arrows at the dwarven cultists blocking the doorway. The wounded cultist is hit in the chest and topples over. The previously healthy cultist, distracted by the ceiling collapsing behind him turns just in time to catch an arrow directly to the eye [Critical hit, yeah!]. The tentacle thing swipes at Ulaan, but misses again [taking attacks of opportunity for shooting while at melee range with this persistent spell effect].\n\nTrevor again targets Garn with a Sacred Flame and misses [0/2]. He also heals Deceit quickly.\n\nThe last remaining cultist, other than Garn, hides behind his column and pulls out another dagger, waiting for someone to try to get closer.\n\nGarn scrambles up the side of the altar and chuckles. *\"So, you're some sorta cleric are ya, ya mouthy little twig? Hah! Lemme show you how that particular trick is s'pposed ta look!\"* [Trevor, as is his way, had previously mouthed off to Garn when we were asking him questions about the first murders. Garn was friends with Nolan, who committed the first sacrificial murders, but was also found dead at the scene]. Garn casts sacred flame at Deceit, seriously wounding her [She's at 1 HP].\n\nForsetti charges at the other cultist, batting his dagger away, and righteously smites him down with a single blow.\n\nDirk follows Forsetti into the chamber, but trips jumping up to the platform. Thankfully for Dirk, he's a really quick runner [Eagle Totem], and he's able to get atop the platform, looming large over Garn, who, as a stocky tradesman, is not exactly a small fry himself.\n\nDeceit and Ulaan both decide that standing next to that tentacle thing is a bad idea, and move away from it, into the chamber proper. They both shoot wide around Garn.\n\nTrevor also moves out of the entryway and again attempts to sear Garn with a sacred flame. *\"Psh, whatever chump. Choke on this!\"* Garn easily sidesteps the spell again [0/3]\n\n*\"Ah, ta hell with this crap!\"* Garn casts Fog, and the platform is quickly enveloped by a dense mist. Nobody can see anything, but Ulaan, just outside of the fog proper, hears a heavy footfall plod across the stone *\"Forsetti, right in front of you!\"* The tentacle spell-thing moves down the stairs towards the entryway, but stops at the door, as though whoever was controlling it was unable to actually see what he was doing anymore [Garn is not a master strategist. The fog also prevents him from seeing the corpses of his allies, which he might otherwise have been able to raise up].\n\nUnable to see his foe, and worried about hits without a chance to defend, Forsetti retreats out of the fog. Ulaan is closest to him when he reaches the clear area again, so Forsetti casts Protection on Ulaan.\n\nDirk is much less cautious and heads towards where he figures Garn should now be, swinging wildly and missing.\n\nWith the fog enveloping the area, Deceit notices that the forcefield seems to extend between the circles of runs on the floor and ceiling, but notices some flickering that indicates that its power is coming from somewhere else in the room. She immediately thinks to try killing Garn, as it might be tied to him, but she can't see him through the fog.\n\nUlaan is also unable to see Garn through the fog, and decides to try shooting the tentacle thing. The arrow sails cleanly through it. Whatever this is, it can't be attacked.\n\nTrevor heals Deceit again and is looking around the room when he spots a gemstone embedded in the wall. Ever-avaricious, he immediately runs over to the wall to attempt to pry it out for himself.\n\nGarn begins casting Burning Hands. Dirk sees a small glow forming in the fog, just in front of him and slashes at it, catching Garn across the chest. Garn finishes casting and pays Dirk back with some rather nasty burns. The rest of the party sees an orange glow in the corner of the fog.\n\nForsetti uses Lay on Hands to heal Deceit further.\n\nDirk is incensed by the pain he just endured and unleashes his rage. Hacking furiously in front of himself, he manages to catch Garn with a solid blow.\n\nDeceit again attempts to spot the power source for the forcefield, but is distracted as a strange mutter begins emanating from the centre of the fog.\n\nUlaan notices three beams of light connected to the forcefield from the walls of the room. The one is clearly originating from the gem that Trevor is attempting to pry from the wall. Ulaan fires at a similar gemstone embedded in the opposite wall. The gem unleashes a small explosion as it's destroyed. *The gems in the wall, smash them!\"*\n\nTrevor, hearing this, flips his dagger around and strikes the gem with its pommel. *\"I'm on it-!\"*, the gem explodes, knocking Trevor into the fog and temporarily blinding him.\n\nTwo cracks of lightning ring out from within the fog. Garn and Dirk are both zapped by these strange bolts and sent flying off of the foggy platform. As Garn slams into a column, his concentration breaks and the fog is dispelled, revealing a strange glowing orb hovering just in front of the altar, near the side of the platform that the two had been standing on. Dirk lands awkwardly off the side of the platform.\n\nForsetti charges this strange orb and gets zapped for his troubles, but he's able to stand tall and resist the accompanying concussive force.\n\nSpying the final gem in the back wall of the chamber, Dirk stands up and runs towards it, unable to quickly draw his hand axes, Dirk opts to lob his great axe at the gemstone. In a dramatic fashion, the axe is right on target, but then the end of the haft contacts the floor early and the axe bounces harmlessly to the side [DM rules that Dirk was attacking with disadvantage for some reason, I can't remember exactly why. His player rolled a critical hit with the first d20. When told to roll the second, she rolled a 2].\n\nDeceit moves around the side of the platform to get a better shot at this final gem, and hits it with an Eldritch Blast. The forcefield around the circle visibly drops.\n\nUlaan, able to see Garn again marks and fires at Garn, and hits him. \n\nTrevor follows this up by rising to his feet and trying another Sacred Flame [0/4]. The strange orb zaps Trevor and knocks him back down. Trevor heals himself.\n\nThe orb throws another bolt out, hitting Forsetti and sending him toppling off the platform.\n\nGarn stands up, but immediately has to duck another bolt of energy from the orb.\n\nForsetti, looking pretty worse for wear at this point, rolls to his feet and ends up near Ulaan.\n\nNow able to draw his hand axes, Dirk lunges at Garn, a whirlwind of rage. Just as looks like he's about to sink an axe deep into Garn's neck, Dirk clunks into the column beside Garn.\n\nDeceit fires an Eldritch Blast just wide of Garn. She tries to get to the altar, but realizes the elevation from the side she's on is too high for her to reach Mrs. Carver [it's like, 10 feet tall, apparently. Presumably, there's stairs on the back side, but none of the party's actually been around that side of the platform and really looked in that direction, so the DM hasn't described it to us].\n\nUlaan fires another arrow at Garn, but he too misses. He runs to the altar as well, but is unable to do much more.\n\nTrevor staggers towards the altar and casts another Sacred Flame at Garn, finally hitting him. [DM actually felt really bad for how unlikely five misses in a row was, so fudged this last one]. *\"Ha!, how's that feel, chump!?\"*\n\nA second orb comes into being near the altar. Garn grins and casts Necrotic Touch on Dirk, grievously wounding him. [Dirk's Relentless Endurance is the only thing keeping him from being unconscious and bleeding out right now]. \n\n*\"Grah! Why won'tcha just f#ckin' die already!?\"*\n\n*\"You first!*\"\n\nGarn turns his head in response, and gets one last glimpse of Forsetti's sword glowing with holy energy as the paladin brings it down on him.\n\n\n[People had to work in the morning, and it was late at this point, so the session ended there. We still have to figure out exactly if Mrs. Carver and her unborn child are still alive, and what the deal is with the orbs].",

So in the campaign we are running, The Shadows of Xhos, we ended up in this huge lavarinth/laboratory/university/dungeon called The Observatory. In the observatory, all kinds of crazy things happen. \n\nOne such thing that has happened to several members of the party, including myself, is that they were cloned. We still don't know how it works. My character is a Pale Elf, and I have this large violet tiger as a pet. In the middle of watch, a clone of myself appeared while I was asleep. \n\nThe last time this happened in our party, it happened to a mage, and now there are two of them. However, my character is a chaotic neutral thief, so I didn't see it going well. He(or rather, I) demanded half of my belonglings, saying they belonged to both of us. I obviously refused. It devolved into a 1v1 knife fight between the two of us, which ended when he tried to throw me into a furnace, which I managed to avoid and stab him in the heart. And that is the story of how I killed myself. ",

The men managed to disassemble the contraption, but we never saw Marcus. We did manage to find an office of sorts in which a single portal hovered over a desk. Oda lost a sword to it and Sugalite some strawberries. Bordel then pointed out a journal, in which the she-Gnome read from it. My boss nearly fainted as she read aloud.\n\nBordel then stood up, cup in hand and walked up to the portal. Of the people I felt more secure around, he was one of them and the thought of losing him to the portal rang in my head.\n\n“Don’t Bordel- please,” I stammered. My eyes were wide and my heart filled with adrenaline.\n\nThe man tightened his jaw, pursed his lips, and gave me a firm look. Dread weighed upon me, but thankfully Bordel dropped the cup. He then turned on his heels and informed us all he’d wait for us outside. I took a deep breath and was just about to retrieve the cup for my boss when Sugalite picked it up.\n\n“I suppose we ought not to leave this behind,” she mentioned. I gave a soft smile in agreeance.\n\nOnce outside, Bordel approached the she-Gnome and while insisting to have the cup back, stated, “Do you now understand the burden I carry?” As he did this, a sound caught my ear. An echoed howl came up from the cave, it’s eeriness chilling my bones.\n\n“We need to go now!” I instructed, not caring about whatever interchange might have been taking place. The others soon understood what I meant and in a moments notice Fern placed upon us a spell to conceal our movements. She then took flight with her cart to attract whatever was to come from the cave. The plan was we’d head East for an hour and wait for her to catch up.\n\nOnce the hour had past, Kimaris spotted a creature following us. It was some kind of three headed bone hound! I was ready to run further and urged the others to do likewise. Bordel however said, “We can’t just let it roam around to kill as it pleases.” The words halted me. I closed my eyes tight, hating how I agreed. I turned around and looked at my boss in the eyes. With my lyre in hand, I struck a chord as I replied, “Then go and do.” With the glow of my magics on his countenance, Bordel lead the attack against the creature. Kimaris was quick to follow, after throwing his robes upon me.\n\nI was still livid with the boy. I forgot to mention that as we headed back into the factory, he slapped my butt! Let alone he’s continued on with childish antics since and I’m starting to wonder which was worse; him when he was a monstrosity or now as an immature boy?\n\nThe robes I shrugged off, my attention taking in the fight. Bordel and Kimaris were grappling the creature when a sense of urgency rushed through me. I had to help... somehow. I summoned the translucent hand and sent it to aid in pinning the bone hound. As I did so, I saw one of the heads go to bite Kimaris. In that moment, my voice rented the air with, “Cud!” the hound pausing, and allowing my comrades to get the final blow in.\n\nA short time later, as I recovered from the initial scare, Fern caught back up to us. Having noticed the bones of the creature, she questioned how it was it found us. After some speculation, I asked Bordel if the cup was magical. It was rather a stupid thing to inquire about. He reminded me of the wish that the ten cups together were suppose to bring about.\n\n“Suppose the hound was drawn to it then?” I mentioned. I recall stories in which items of importance usually had a way of luring beasts and folk alike to them, no matter how hard one may try to cover it’s auras up.\n\nWhen I gave that answer, I hadn’t thought about the gravity of that notion until Bordel said, “Then we can expect more of these creatures to find us.”\n\nOh the pit that formed in my stomach. I blinked back the tears rapidly as my head spun and my hands became clammy. With Kimaris nothing more than a boy (and a disrespectful one at that!), I no longer feared him. With that gone, there was no reason for me to stay- other than my fear of wandering alone.\n\nI insisted that we return to Asura. Sugalite piped in saying that she was headed that way to turn in a bounty. However Fernwood begged otherwise. “It’s not safe there,” she said. I pleaded with Bordel, expressing that I respected him, but with all that had happened, it wasn’t what I had signed up for. It was clear I wasn’t cut out for the work at hand.\n\nThen came this reply: “Malaney, you knew very well what you were getting into when you took this job on. You agreed to come.”\n\nIf ever there was a forest that was amidst a drought and a lightning storm came about, Bordel’s words were the spark that ignited the fire. How dare he think I came willingly! How dare he refuse to help me!\n\n“No!” I shouted, “I did not agree to this! I was BULLIED into this by HIM!!” I seethed, pointing at Kimaris. The boy- or rather I should say Tolaj Yaæ, smirked in his nakedness.\n\n“Hey, I began nothing,” he started in his arrogant tone, “Just because you’re a sheep doesn’t make it my fault.”\n\n“I’m not a sheep,” I snapped.\n\n“Then why are you here?”\n\nI pursed my lips as reason fled. I never had felt such anger before. It’s truly awful.\n\nKimaris then got in front of me, placing his face close to mine. I’d probably say he was handsome if his attitude wasn’t so foul. \n\n“Hit me,” the boy instructed. Normally I wouldn’t, but for that instance, I clenched my fists ready to strike hard, but he added, “Come on sheep! Hit me!”\n\nMy hands remained at my side. I wasn’t going to let him decide for me. Instead I marched away- away from everyone and sat down in my solitude. My fingers itched for music and so I pulled my flute out and played it. I allowed my soul to get lost into it, so much so that I didn’t recognize the song I was playing at first. It was Araja’s song... it has been well over two months since I last performed it.\n\nThe song got me thinking. I had felt this out of control once before and it was when Araja died. Achmath told me in light of the little girl’s death that I’d overcome the pain. The loss would flee and my heart would mend. I had questioned, “What if it doesn’t?”\n\n“Toir Aj,” he called me, “You’re stronger than you know. You always make the best of the worst.”\n\nHeavens I miss him. How ashamed I’d be if he saw me now. So in memory of Achmath, I’ll persevere. \n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n",

        "text": "I'm currently DMing a group of relatively new players. We started a few months back with The Lost Mine of Phandelver and have played three sessions of Princes of the Apocalypse. After an initial session in which the party wandered about and resolutely ignored all prompts toward the main plot (they are thoroughly disinterested in the Mirabar Delegation) the group found themselves at Rivergard Keep. They searched the Keep inside and out for any evidence of ghosts-- why else would it be called a Haunted Keep?-- and finally got frustrated. \"We heard tales on the road of the Burning Man Druid Festival. Let's go check that out.\"\n\nThe group was immediately welcomed by a quartet of rowdy druids who had been partaking of sacred druidic mushrooms for some weeks. They were perhaps most confused by the elk grazing at the edge of the druids' campsite. \"Oh! Have you ever, like, been an elk, man? They are deeply spiritual creatures! You've got to try it!\" One of the druids assumed the form of an elk and brayed at them.\n\nThe party excused themselves, and headed toward Scarlet Moon Hall. Just within the walls, they were stopped by guards armed with crossbows. The party inquired about a campsite of their own for the night, so that they might observe the Rite of the Burning of the Wicker Giant the next day. A few druids of the Scarlet Moon Circle told the party that they could perhaps earn a meeting with the head of the Circle and earn a campsite if they ousted the druids at the entrance who disrespected the spirit of the rite. Simply purify the campsite of disrespectful druids, and all would become clear.\n\nThe party headed back toward the entrance, deep in debate. They were approached by a druid from another campsite. He subtly probed them for information about all they had seen at the Hall. He made a sign at them with his fingers. The group all gasped. They had seen a similar shape stitched on the robes of a group who had attacked them on the road. They had been making that sign themselves when asking about the attackers. The group's affable halfling monk returned the sign.\n\n\"Ah! You have come from Rivergard Keep?\" the druid asked.\n\n\"We have...\" the group returns, hesitantly.\n\n\"Then you are my reinforcements! I am a spy, sent to keep tabs on the Cult of the Eternal Flame! Any aid that I may lend is yours.\"\n\nThe spy lets the party know they are being tested. If they demonstrate the knack for destruction that the Eternal Flame prizes, they will earn their trust and possibly be able to halt the machinations of the foul Cult.\n\nHere, the party could not reach consensus. To kill the daft druids would surely be an act of gravest evil. They were harmless. But to earn the trust of the Eternal Flame would allow for great acts of good, positioning them to possibly put a stop to great evil.\n\nAs they debated, they walked toward the campsite. They suddenly became aware of eyes on them. They headed toward a nearby camp and made contact with some fake druids planted by the Eternal Flame to keep an eye on things. They had a starved and abused bear wearing a choke collar chained to a stake. The monk decided to free the bear. He was caught trying to approach it. The Eternal Flame cultists agreed to allow him to use the bear in clearing the stoned druid camp. He agreed, planning to release the bear safely.\n\nA halfing, as it turned out, is not suited to holding the leash of a starved bear when it scents prey. The smell of the elk drove the bear wild. He wrenched free of the monk's grasp, and mauled an elk. As the elk was being torn asunder, he began to scream and shifted back to his true, human form. The erstwhile monk stepped in and rendered the bear unconscious. He grabbed the chain and began to drag the bear into the wilderness.\n\nThe other druids, unable to deal with the mauling of their friend, gibbered and screamed and cried. The group tried to talk to them, but the druids were inconsolable and half-mad. The group's paladin swiftly knocked the other three druids unconscious.\n\nThe party's fighter thanked him. \"Now, heal the other druid,\" she said, smiling.\n\n\"No,\" replied the paladin.\n\n\"What do you mean, 'no?!'\"\n\n\"It is terrible that he is dying. But we now have a body to give to the Cultists. Through his death, the greater good will be served.\"\n\nDesperate, the fighter wheeled on the cleric. \"You have to save him!\"\n\n\"Well... now... it's interesting...\" the elven cleric replied. \"I agree with the paladin. We will be positioned better if we let him die.\"\n\nIn disgust, the fighter rounded up the other druids. \"Before you all lose your minds entirely!\" she spat. She hefted them and headed into the wilds. After a tense moment, the cleric joined her, sharing the load.\n\nThe drow wizard began to loot the campsite, as the paladin prayed over the poor druid as he breathed his last.\n\nThe monk, fighter, and cleric all journeyed an hour away from the campsite in different directions, the fighter and cleric carrying druids and the monk dragging the unconscious bear by his choke collar.\n\nWhen the monk felt he had gotten the bear safely away, he went to uncollar the bear. He then saw his mistake. He had strangled the poor beast, dragging it by the throat for an hour. Tears welled. He pried the collar from the beast's flesh, and said a simple prayer. He stashed the collar in his bag, a constant reminder of the price of good intentions poorly thought through.\n\nThe cleric and the fighter set the druids in a secluded spot. The fighter left them a dagger to defend themselves, and a few days worth of trail rations.\n\nThe party reconvened at the campsite. They brought the corpse of the poor mauled druid to the Cultists at the Hall. They were granted an audience with Elizar Dryflagon the next day.",

        "text": "I figured the handful of you that enjoyed the last such summaries might enjoy these. \n\nJournal of DD Catchfire, 13 May 1894:\n\nI cannot sleep. I sit at a small table with an uneven top, the boards warped and split through years of careless use. It is nearly 4 o' clock in the morning, past my usual hour of retiring. I have not been able to relax since I and my companions were attacked.\n \nI have never felt myself to be terribly handy with the pen, I must admit. My hand moves too slowly, scratching away at symbols while my mind races ahead, and I consider myself much more practiced at the recitation of words previously written than the artificer of those yet to be.\n \nRecent events, however, have compelled me to make a poor attempt at their recollection.\n\nAllow me to introduce, first, the players:\n\nDANIEL D. CATCHFIRE: Actor of no small renown, and your humble narrator\n\nDOCTOR MILTON ROLAND: Archaeologist, relic-hunter, and self-proclaimed authority on matters of the occult\nMISS HONORIA GREEN: Huntress, wilderness guide, and rifle-woman\n\nMISTER R: Former acquaintance of mine, whose invite was the catalyst to all that follows\n\n\nTwo nights hence, an acquaintance of mine invited me to a night of curiosities at the local library. The note was succinct, direct, and intriguing in the way of such mysteries. Only one thing gave me pause: the acquaintance,  Mr R, had become familiar to me during the production of a play which I cannot remember. The man's face and name, I remember quite clearly. I remember the cast, the crew, I remember the faces of the crowd past the stage-lights, and I remember the booming applause. Yet as much as I search my mind, I cannot remember a bare sliver of a line, nor can I recall the sound of the music or the edges of the plot. It is a hole in my memory.\n \nBoredom outfought reason, and I decided to attend.\n \nThe curiosity was put on by the local library, as I have said. If Mr R had invited anyone else of note, they had not responded favorably, as the crowd was full of men and women of modest means and base interests. Their conversations - snippets I overheard before I was recognized - were full of dreck, of mystical nonsense and pseudo-science.\n \nNever the less, I took my seat. Mr R made his entrance and hesitantly introduced his artefact, concealed in a suitcase which he held like a newborn infant. Unpacking his device, I saw that it was some sort of gramophone, of the type that had recently become quite popular among the wealthy. I found it quite strange that Mr R, a man of means far below modest, would have possessed himself of such an item.\n \nMr R, though in desperate need of elocution lessons and an introduction into the mysteries of projection, got through his soliloquy like a soldier on the march. He had acquired a sound recording, in the form of a disc of some slick, resinous material, which was evidently of a unique provenance. A Professor White was said to be the progenitor, whose explorations into the science of sound capturing had yielded secrets, if Mr R was to be believed, of some Otherworldly nature.\n \nHe began the recording without any transition, and the entire experience gave me some discomfort. The music, such as it was, started, it seemed, at the height of the Devil’s Trill Sonata, the graceful strains belying its hideous source. Imagine an orchestra pit full of songbirds pursued by adders. Imagine skulls played as drums, fiddles made of flesh, melodies pulled from the throats of the dead. Imagine the most elegant, beauteous sounds wrought from nature twisted into hideous parodies.\n \nYet, under the foulness, there was more. Somewhere below, as the nauseating music played above, was the sound of truth ringing clearly in the distance. It compelled one to follow, to listen for the hidden strains, the pipes of angels, amidst the macabre orgy of the damned. As I listened, it seemed that my body hummed in time. My muscles tightened and my breath caught, and I was swept bodily along a road of odious music. Electrified, I felt as if the stars, the vast cosmos, lay before me and I was its witness. It was as if the music of the spheres was played, laying its truth carnally bare. This was truth! The Universe spoke, and its voice was profound and unbearable!\n\nWriting these lines have done little to calm my nerves. Looking over them once again, I felt nearly transported to that lurid moment, and felt once again that my gaze allowed some great dread thing to peer into my very soul.\n \nI shudder still.\n \nAfter the recording, I regained my composure enough to speak with some of those gathered. I met a Dr Roland, an academic doctor who resembled nothing so much as a bust carved by some ancient Greek artist, who abandoned the project before completion. He at once assaulted me with perceptive questions as to the nature of my affiliation with R, and the effects of the music upon my person. I warded away his questions by providing information about Mr R. I felt at that moment a profound fear that Dr Roland had had the same response to the music, and I do not believe my soul would have survived the knowledge that my reaction had been anything but a fancy.\n \nI rambled at anyone nearby for quite some time. I recall denigrating the usefulness of the device to all who would listen, arguing for the abandonment of recorded sound as a puerile bauble, to reassert the dominance of live theater, of live music. Something more wholesome.\n \nI found myself speaking with Dr Roland, who features somewhat heavily in the events that follow. Again I found him impolite, prying, and smug, and hastened to extricate myself from his conversation. When his questions worked toward Mr R, I was happy to thrust his snooping toward my former colleague. I called Mr R over and made my exit with as much grace as was possible.\n\nOutside the library I savored the blessedly cool air, and found woman doing much the same. She had been leaning heavily on her knees, and straightened as soon as I came out. She was in an unusual costume – though given the nature of the evening’s entertainment I suppose nothing would qualify as normal – a pair of men’s pants and a practical jacket of the sort that trophy hunters often wear. \n\nI introduced myself with a bow. She had, of course, heard of me. She introduced herself as a Miss Honoria Greene, a guide to the wretched wilderness that still dominates the state of Michigan, and a huntress of some renown. We spoke frivolously, and I suspect that she and I had had similar reactions to that wretched music. I offered my arm as we entered the library again, and received an invitation from Mr R to repair to his hotel lounge and indulge in a cigar. Though the thought of spending any more time in the presence of that man made me nauseous, I could fathom no means of turning down the invite without seeming a boor.\n\nWould that I had.\n\nMr R spoke that night of a thousand things. Dark, weird, unfathomable things. Books that bent the mind and societies that plumbed ancient catacombs, of discoveries in far-flung lands and secrets unearthed under cobbled city streets. Mr R was so magnificently enraptured by these oddities that I began to feel more at ease. It was obvious the man was mad, the unusual performance that made our acquaintance had obviously troubled him more than it had me. Eventually he rounded to the point: Dr White’s shuddersome recording.\n\nThe aforementioned Professor White (thought it came as somewhat of a surprise to me to find that Dr White was in fact a woman) was apparently widely known in various occult circles, and her recordings were particularly sought after for their bizarre nature. She dwelled in the dusty little town in which I know put pen to paper, a grim place called Solomon’s Hole.\n\nDr Roland wrested these details off of Mr R with an inquisitor’s ambition. I surmised at the time - and subsequent events have confirmed - that Dr Roland had previously encountered something of this nature before. He spoke of a book, whose nefarious nature I could only uncover by inference, entitled The Vagueries of the Universe, with which Dr. Roland had been intimately acquainted some time in the past.\n\nWith a suddenness that shocked me, Dr. Roland determined that he was to venture to Solomon’s Hole to interview this Professor White. The lady, Miss Green, quickly offered her services as guide. The two agreed and shook hands. I was forgotten.\n\nOf all the damnable sins contracted in a life on the stage, none is more insidious than hubris. I coughed politely. I adjusted my cravat. I sucked on my cigar. I called their attention to me with every subvocal means at my prodigious disposal, and brought the inflexible rules of polite society, those grim carronades of social combat, against them. An invite was secured, of course it was.\n\nCurse my foolish, overreaching pride! Like Oedipus before the throne of Thebes, I stood exultant, oblivious to my perfidious fortune. There is no fellow in the firmament, proclaimed Caesar with knives at his back.\n\nAlas.\n\nThe trip out needs no elaboration. We took a train to a train to a train, and arrived in the wild. Solomon’s Hole, seen by Evening’s bruised hand, the battered sister to Dawn’s rosy fingers, was a dusty pit filled to bursting with arenose workers and a track beaten by countless pounding footsteps from the gravel pits to the tavern. We asked questions of Professor White. A recluse, we were told, who received but few visitors, and those were mysterious to the domesticated personnages of the town. A blind man had visited most recently. A man with a cloth over his eyes, but walked with no stick or dog. Unusual, but not threatening.\n\nWe spent the first night in repose. Or, my comrades did. I regaled all who would listen - I venture to say a fair portion of the town - with tales of heroics and adventure, and spoke through the night with fair-eyed ladies. \n\nThe next morning I was awoken to see my companions girded for travel. Professor White’s house stood out of town, and it would be a long walk to the property. I dressed as quickly as sleepy fingers allowed, cursing the weak swill the inn called coffee, but before long I was ready, like Orpheus before the Underworld.\n\nI admit to some discomfort with the wild. Potted plants on occasion dress the stage, but seldom does an actor of note traipse through the brambles and thistles of the trackless wilderness. Miss Green proved a remarkable guide, pointing out the various wild things that clawed their way onto the narrow wagon-wheel road. Though she kept her rifle in a case, I had no doubt whatever that she would ably handle any prospective threat from the dark woods. Of threats, I knew little. Wildcats? Wolves? Wolverines? Had I but known what was coming, I would have given little thought to the threats of the woods.\n\nThe house stood on a low rise, with a gunshot straight gravel path running up to its main entrance, despite the images of a Transylvanian clifftop path that had seized my imagination. It looked like an antebellum plantation, a colonnaded porch and enormous oaken doors overseeing a vast green lawn.\n\nI knocked. No answer. I rang a bell. Still nothing. Finally, at the advice and the prodding of both Dr. Roland and Miss Green, I tried the door. It opened, creaking like a stage prop. I noticed first an enormous chandelier that had been crudely converted to use electrical power, the cord staked along the ceiling and wall, with no fair concealment attempted.\n\nMiss Green, naturally, noticed the drag marks. As if something wagon-sized had been dragged down the stairs and across the foyer’s floor. It had a twin outside, we now realized. We called for Professor White, but heard no response, and my companions and I decided to search the house. I followed the cord, compelled by curiosity.\n\nIt led, bizarrely, outside, and before long I found a small saltbox shed - a late construction, I surmised - with thick bundles of rubberized electrical wires leading through what resembled a mouse-hole.\n\nI opened the door and found myself the victim of my own creeping apprehension, which had, until that point, gone unnoticed. Inside was a coal-fed generator, and inside the coal chute was a black man, caked with coal dust and ash, completely one with the background until he moved. I fell upon my backside with a short bark of surprise, and the man shimmied down the chute after mastering his own terrific fright. I recovered and introduced myself, lacking the creativity for any other response of worth. His name was given as Bugler Joseph, hired-man for the mistress of the house. Halfway through honoring him for his service - as his age and name marked him as a veteran of the late war - he subjected me to what I might kindly call an interview.\n\nHe asked if I was one of “them” or if “they” had gone, and what happened to the Professor. I told him I had no such knowledge.\n\nJust then, Miss Green ran out of the house, desperately calling for me. I tried to calm her, but she grabbed my arm and led me to the house, up the stairs, and to a small office.\n\nI cannot describe what happened to me on witnessing the grotesqueries contained in that room. Nothing seemed real until I could feel the still-damp blood squishing under my shoes. My mind recoiled, and I immediately fled to the hallway. Professor White was tied to a chair, the top of her skull cut away and her brains removed, and her blood soaked her clothing and the carpet beneath. Even now my hand rejects such a recounting.\n\nDr Roland joined us, and we three were so overcome by revulsion that it took some time before we could venture back in. There we spent what time we could in investigating. I found a picture of Professor White with two other gentlemen, smiling and happy and alive. Dr Roland found a letter warning the woman of continuing with her dread experiments and signed “T.E.”\n\nWe could not continue. We left for the town immediately, after convincing Bugler Jospeh to accompany us.\n\nThe rest of that day was a blur. We were questioned by the constable before Miss Green and Dr Roland carted me around town conducting their own investigation. We asked the post-master, the tavern-keeper, the men who worked the gravel pits, house-wives and urchins. We traced the visits of unusual men and fast-talked train yard book-keepers.\n\nSomeone had stolen something quite large from the house and had transported it to Port Huron, evidently. Yet, we returned to town, hoping that after a night of rest things would be made more clear, and we could pass along our grim findings to the constabulary of the town, such as it was.\n\nIt is absurd to me that this was mere hours ago. Reality bends around the horrific.\n\nI shall waste no more time. I was fitfully asleep when I was awoken to the sound of a crash upon my door. The inn was cheap, and the door splintered. I jolted to my feet and clawed for my sword-cane, the only weapon I had thought to bring. More shouts, the sounds of a struggle, and a gunshot! I threw caution to the wind and yanked open the door, finding a man clambering to his feet at my threshold. Though I could make out few details, I knew the man meant ill, and I thrust at the villain with my sword cane.\n\nHamlet, alas, was long ago, and my fencing skills had waned. I missed, and plunged my steel into the floor, where it was stuck fast. My attacker, still merely a dark form, lunged at me, seizing me round the throat and pinning my arms to the floor. I squirmed and rolled, kicked and spat and bit and struck, and somehow wriggled from under that grip.\n\nDr Roland, that champion, that ennobled academic! There he stood, above my assailant, saber flashing in the dim lamplight. But the villain above me rose and spun, faster than I could have believed. He made to lunge at the Doctor. I rose, clumsily, to hinder the attacker, but just as I gained my feet, I heard a sickening word, a twisting of sound that brought me back to that evening at the library, and then an all-encompassing crack!\n\nMy attacker’s body careened into me, a cannonball of flesh, and drove me back through my room, where I came to rest in the closet, cushioned by my clothes! Never again will I suffer the indignity of insult for a well-stocked wardrobe! Blessed sartorial saviors, I shall honor the saint of all tailors until the day I die.\n\nThere had been three of them. The one outside my door was a huge man of the far-eastern persuasion, missing his ears, as if they had been removed through some bizarre surgery. Is he connected to the eyeless man? Is there some grim cabal of crippled men exacting revenge on the well-formed? Are we to be assaulted, on the morrow, by a man missing his fingers, or his tongue? I digress. The other two were unremarkable toughs. Dr Roland had evidently cut another down with his sword, and Miss Green had fairly removed the last’s shoulder with her rifle. A formidable pair, I must admit.\n\nBut how did Dr Roland cause my attacker to fly across the room with such force? That I cannot fathom and that, more, perhaps, than the murdered woman and ear-deprived attacker, gives me pause. Am I allied to some sorcerer?\n\nTime shall tell. I feel strange. The night’s events chill but exhilarate, as if I am standing on the precipice of a cliff that promises a safe fall. I cannot explain it any other way. I could go home, easily. But will I? Should I?\n\nTime shall tell. For now, Dawn makes her rosy presence known, and I shall attempt to rouse myself from this disquietude before the day begins.\n",

        "text": "There was a post a while ago, titled [The League of Incompetent Evil](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3g0lzd/pathfinder_league_of_incompetent_evil/). \nWe are the players and GM of that campaign.\nIt ended in disaster, with betrayals, backstabbing, nuclear-level explosions and the destruction of the Necril Imperium.\nAnd unfortunately, none of us that were playing had the sense to actually record what happened.\nWe’ve decided that that simply isn’t good enough, so we’re working together to record each session and compile our adventure for your reading pleasure.\nIf the writing style changes, it’s because a different player wrote that section.\nSo, without further ado, we present:\n\n**The League of Incompetent Evil: Meridia’s Revenge.**\n\n\n**Setting:**\nIt is 20 years after the last campaign ended in defeat. The Mad God of the Ocean, Meridia and her Sahuagin servants sacked the Elyrium archipelago, the naval base for the Necril Imperium, slaughtering all they came across. The advanced Mostovi people crossed the sea to the mainland in great skyships, ironclad ships with smoke pluming from great chimneys crossed the waves, and hulking iron monstrosities that crushed the land beneath their treads.\n\nTogether, the Mostovi and Shiman alliance stormed the Prandurian desert, and took key tunnels that led them to Necropolis, the capital city of the Necril Imperium. In their wrath, they caved in the ceiling on entire city. The Ascendant and Emir Hassan, champions of the gods Harbinger, the God of Science and Kami-Yokai, the God of Luck, respectively, seized a hold of a juvenile Dawnflower, using it’s power to restore the undead to their mortal form, mortally wounding Cain, the God of Undeath and driving him to the depths of the Underworld, not dead, but a shadow of his former self.\nIn order to prevent the forces of evil threatening humanity again, the Mostovi immediately tendered an ultimatum to the other nations of man. Join the Coalition of Man or be crushed. After decades of war with the Imperium, Shima, Raynor, Prandur and Phaestral accepted, becoming the new states of a single nation. The nation of Ashtabar refused, unwilling to allow the Coalition to regulate their magical freedom and research.\n\nBegrudgingly, humanity’s respective gods formed the first pantheon in millennia, forced to accede to the wishes of their people. Harbinger took his rightful place as King, with Kami-Yokai as his right hand fox.\n\nDespite the efforts of the Coalition over the last few years, the situation is still unstable. Many of the other gods have shown their displeasure at the current balance of power, and have been rebelling against the new order. Powerful Celestials and Fiends seek to carve out territory in the new world, and the major deities who’ve rejected the Coalition have formed their own alliance. Key among them is the Mad God of the Ocean, Meridia, who’s determined to bring this new force of Order to its knees.\n\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe characters created for this campaign start at Level 10 and each has a powerful Boon granted to them by the GM.\nThe cast for this grand tale is as follows:\n\n\n**Azalea:**\nA changeling Druid. Half Mermaid (we home ruled that sea hags are corrupted mermaid priestesses of Meridia) half human. She gained a love of the oceans after growing up in the archipelago, and former Imperial territory, known as Elyria. She serves Meridia to save the oceans she loves from the pollution that the rampant industrialisation during the peacetime has caused. \n\n**Boon:**\nDue to her oceanic heritage, Azalea can breathe in both air and water with no difficulties. \n\n\n**Suu:** \nA Squole Druid/Slimelord. Created in a Mostovian genetics research facility, she escaped many years ago. Since then, she has become an adopted mother to 3 girls, whom she raises as if they were her own and has settled down in Phaestral, one of the nations in the Coalition of Man. She serves Meridia to hunt down the scientists that created her, to stop them from harming her family.\n\n**Boon:** \nBody Mastery: Suu has total control over her body, allowing her to take any shape equal to the total volume of her body.\n\n\n**Cailith:**\nAn Elven Arcane Archer. Abandoned as an infant he was founded by a tribe of orcs west of Shima, who took him in and raised him as one of his own. He became the tribes hunter and now he has moved on to the life of adventuring. Through the last 20 years he has seen much of the world with his previous adventuring party and thus knows of many of its dangers. \n\n**Boon:**\nA Bloodbound Bow, which allows him to drain his own hit points in order to do more damage.\n\n**Mordred**\nA Drow Blade Adept Arcanist. Used as a bargaining chip by the gods of the world. Served most of the warring gods. Extremely paranoid and suspicious of authority since most mortals aren't aware of who “owns” him at any one point in time. Has an authoritarian complex and prefers\nutter chaos since that’s all he has really known. Currently “controlled” by the God of Elyria, Meridia (though the gods are debating this constantly).\n\n**Boon**\nAn extra Black Blade, though in the form of a revolver. This intelligent weapon has a higher ego than his sword cane.\n\n**Umbrinde**\nA Fetchling Rogue. The self titled ‘Shadow of Madness’, he lives to destabilize the material plane. Under the service of Meridia, the mad God of the oceans, he kills and steals in order to create pure chaos. \n\n**Boon**\nIncreased control over his shadow walk.\n\n**Session 1: The Rat Pack Begins.**\nThe session opened with the party being teleported into a wheat field, with a strange man.\n\n“Greetings mortals, such a pleasure to make your acquaintance,” said the Jester, as he tipped his hat with an exaggerated bow. A grin split his face in half, but the smile never reached his eyes, which looked hollow, as if there were bloodthirsty predators lurking in their depths.\nHis clothing was colourful and expensive, his stance relaxed, though you got the feeling he could spring into action in an instant. A strange feeling of fear and revulsion tingled down your spine as you met his gaze. We’d all heard of him before, a demigod in Meridia’s service. Few knew what his true purpose was, but rumours tell of a madman who’d bathed in the blood of legions. A man who even demons feared. A man who was born of the mad goddess herself.\n \n“Oh, you must be wondering why you’ve been summoned here, to the heathen lands of Phaestral. You have all offered prayers to my mistress, and she demands your service. Should you serve her well, your prayers may be answered. For now, the goddess has taken interest in one particular Mostovi scientist. He goes by Dominic Lokir, and his research is most interesting and quite crucial to Harbinger’s continued supremacy. We want him eliminated.”\n\nAfter being left by the Jester with little to no explanation for what is going on, the party set off towards the nearest settlement, the seaside city of Elia-Noir. In the wheatfield they found themselves in, they found a man strung up like a scarecrow, with no obvious wounds and a smile on his face, as if he had died laughing. After spending several minutes trying to examine this mysterious corpse, it was determined that he had died of a heart attack. Upon finishing our examinations, Suu declared that she was hungry, and her ooze form enveloped the corpse to begin digesting it. Terrified of the display, Cailith ran towards Elia-Noir, screaming out about monsters as he did. \n\nThe party eventually caught up with Cailith along the road to Elia-Noir. After some travel, the party was accosted by an armed patrol riding an old fashioned army vehicle. Suu was arrested due to her suspicious appearance (Considering she is a green humanoid ooze) and lack of official papers proving her citizenship, and she was taken into the city by car. Azalea Wild Shaped into a finch and followed in the air. The other three plebs, Cailith, Mordred and Umbrinde, had to hoof it to the city.\n\n\nSuu was taken to a Coalition military compound inside the city for processing, though she grew impatient with the long wait and angered her guards, who put her in a cell. She tried to tell them that she had left her Citizenship papers in her house and that she would teleport with some guards, get them and return. But to no avail, the guards insisted that she be kept in a cell to “follow procedure”. \n\nThree concrete walls and metal bars are nothing to Suu, who could simply walk between the bars, her ooze form flowing around the metal. This obviously aggravated the guard, who threatened to shoot her if she did not return to her cell. Suu complied and began trying to bribe him, with offers of knitting him a nice hat and matching gloves. The guard informed her that he did accept bribes, but of a carnal, sexual nature. Suu asked if there was anything she could do for him, but the guard simply called her a monster and walked over the equipment lockers, where Suu’s belongings were being kept.\n\nSuu warned the guard that if he stole her belongings, he would pay for it. He ignored her and began rummaging through her bag. She then oozed out through the bars and began to walk towards the guard. He turned, raised his rifle and told her to get back into her cell. Suu refused.\nHe shot at Suu, inflicting minimal damage and cried out that the prisoner was escaping. Suu ran at the guard, leaping towards him and enveloping him from head to toe. She recovered her items and began to leave the building, dealing acid damage to the guard trapped inside her.\n\nAs Suu walked towards the exit, four additional guards arrived in response to the alarm. Suu turned to face them and moved her body to the back of the first guard, using him has a shield. The new guards demanded that Suu release their comrade, she refused. The first guard yelled to his comrades to shoot anyway. Suu silenced him by snaking a tendril of her body into his nose and mouth, filling his lungs with ooze.\n\nShe resumed her walk to the exit as the other guards fire at her, killing their comrade and hurting Suu. With her capture dead, Suu dropped him in favour of running. She ran out the front of the building and into the compound itself. More guards from outside turned and fired on her. She’s almost dead at this point.\n\nSuu crouched down and cast Ash Storm, then turned into a puddle about one inch deep. The guards fired into the storm but to no avail. Suu moved towards the gate, casting Blessing of the Salamander on herself. The guards then decided to throw a grenade into the Ash Storm. \n\nThe roll: natural 1. The grenade bounced to the other side of the storm, killing the guards coming from inside the building. The other guard fired his rifle, but it misfired, causing it to explode. Suu moved to the very edge of the storm and cast Greater Thunderstomp, knocking the guards prone. The got back up and fired again, one bullet hitting Suu. She then cast Cheetah’s Sprint and ran past the guards, out the gate, Wild Shaping into a robin and flying away to a nearby roof.\n\nMeanwhile, Azalea located the compound, and attempted to reunite with the party. They eventually reached the outskirts of the city and looked for a bar to quench their thirst. The first tavern, run by an elderly lady, served no alcoholic beverages, so they left in disgust. Azalea finally reunited with the rest of the party and landed on Cailith’s shoulder, still in the form of a finch. The second tavern they found was run by an elderly barbarian and his little daughter. Umbrinde decided to buy a round for the three party members (who weren’t tiny birds) which ended up costing him a steep 150 gp.\n\nCailith got into a conversation with the bartender who lamented his barbarian youth. He quickly made the mistake of calling him young (even as an elderly man he was quite young in comparison to the elf). Eventually the disagreement began to turn into a brawl between the barbarian wanting to regain his honor and Cailith who got a nasty punch in the ribs. In an attempt to stop the brawl (and probably save Cailith in the process) the party tricked the barbarian by telling him the first tavern owner insulted his prized brew. He stormed out in disgust, ready to exact revenge, leaving his little daughter in charge of the tavern. Not seeing the girl as a threat, Umbrinde decided to steal his money back, and anything else left behind the counter. The little girl began warning him to put it back or “he’d be sorry”. Still not seeing the threat, he took no notice of her warnings.\n\nThe girl turned out to also be a barbarian and went into rage, growing taller than most of the party members. Azalea flew into the air to avoid her, while the three on the ground split up. Mordred made both himself and Umbrinde invisible as Cailith ran around a corner. The girl attempted to charge at the spot where Mordred disappeared from but failed and smashed head first through a wall. The party got away and she was was left disorientated by the experience, and was escorted home by a neighbour.\n\nUnable to see either Umbrinde or Mordred, Azalea again followed Cailith and landed on his shoulder. They began planning to find their target and decided that the docks and warehouses would be the best place to look first. Using her bird's eye view of the city, Azalea lead Cailith in the direction of the docks. \n\nThe party was alerted to trouble by klaxxon alarms ringing from the Coalition compound. Knowing Suu had been taken there, they set off in that direction, though they were still separated from their brawl with the barbarian child. Umbrinde was robbed by a young boy, and a chase occurred, ending with the Fetchling tackling the boy to the ground and knocking him unconscious, as he attempted to cry out that Umbrinde was a pervert.\n\nMordred, in his paranoia, remained invisible, and set off on foot without the party, avoiding armed patrols who were searching the streets and homes for the escaped Ooze. He eventually reached the compound and waited on a rooftop outside of it.\n\nAzalea, Cailith and Umbrinde reunited with each other, and set off for the compound, though Umbrinde and Cailith were ordered to lie on the ground by a Coaliton patrol as they searched the area. Azalea naturally, was still a bird, and was left alone. Cailith, after being interrogated by a Mostovi soldier in powered armour, was taken to the compound to have his tourist visa cleared, as he entered the country by teleport and not through official Coalition migration channels.\n\nCailith entered the building, though found that he could not afford to pay for an official tourist or working visa. He struck a deal with the elderly woman processing his claim, who gave him a temporary 24 hour visa and gave him her address for payment of a ‘different nature’.\n\nHeading outside, the commotion from the Coalition manhunt has died down, as it is obvious the Ooze woman had escaped. He ran into Mordred, who he informs that he needs to apply for a visa as well. Mordred has far worse luck than the handsome Cailith, and is forced to wait nearly an hour for his claim to be processed, approved and given an ID card. \n\nIn the meantime, the rest of the party rejoined each other and set off towards the docks, leaving Mordred behind. Suu had managed to evade the search patrols and found Azalea by accident, after chirping to blend in. After a brief conversation in bird, the two caught up to Cailith and Umbrinde.\n\nThey began snooping around a number of warehouses, eventually finding one that looked a bit run down, with what looked like a homeless man sleeping in front of the door. Cailith briefly interrogated the man, before growing aggravated and putting an arrow through his neck. The man had enough time to call the alarm and unknown armed assailants began firing from the warehouse. Cailith retreated to the other side of the warehouse, looking for another way in. Umbrinde ran for his life, eventually taking shelter with some Phaestran guards, who were waiting for military backup.\n\nAs the enemies rushed out to attack, they were hindered by Azalea, who created a geyser in their ranks, incapacitating two, and driving the others back into the warehouse. Moments later, an enemy in powered armour appeared, wielding a chainsword and a large, ominous looking pistol. Suu momentarily stopped him by turning the dirt below him to mud, though an enemy spellcaster telekinetically lifted him out of it. He then turned his strange pistol on the birds who were causing him trouble, launching an arcane bolt that exploded in midair, seriously damaging the druids.\n\nCailith snuck up from behind, and with a calculated shot aiming for an unprotected part of the power armour’s fuel tank, caused the suit to explode, engulfing the area with flame. The enemy spellcaster, who was earlier revealed to be the armoured man’s wife, flew into a rage, and used baleful polymorph on the offending Cailith, who was turned into an albino rat, though with his mind intact. In the ensuing struggle, the sorceress used Feeble Mind on Suu, who had wildshaped into a behemoth hippopotamus by this point. She failed her save, and was left with 1 intelligence and 1 charisma from the spell, and trapped, both mentally and physically, as a hippopotamus.\n\nCailith and Azalea quickly came up with a plan, as Suu was merely frolicking in the ocean, unable to coalesce a coherent thought. Azalea turned into a rat as well, and they were both carried on Suu’s snout as she swam for the nearest river. The military showed up soon afterwards, and arrested the surviving assailants. At this point Mordred and Umbrinde arrived back at the docks, though they’d lost the other party members. They then set off to find out more about the target that the Jester had ordered them to eliminate, Dominic Lokir.\n\nOn the river, Suu, Azalea and Cailith meandered about, looking for some less abrasive fresh water. They were momentarily accosted by some Coalition troops on a motorboat, until they realised how large Suu was and sped off. Azalea then had the idea to use baleful polymorph on Suu, as a rat would be more easily dealt with, and much easier to hide, than a hippo. Also, her mind as a rat would actually be in better shape than what the spellcaster had left it as.\n\nThey exited the river, and made their way to a lovely house by the river. They made it to the back door, but to their dismay found a dog door. This was an issue, as they were all still rats. As it turns out, out of the door came a Corgi, who Azalea immediately befriended with an excellent wild empathy check. Azalea then threw an aqueous orb towards the river, which the Corgi attempted to fetch. The Corgi caught up to the orb and attempted to catch it, trapping itself in the orb, quickly knocking itself out, though Azalea dispelled the orb before it could drown inside it. \n\nUsing this opportunity to enter the house, Suu headed for the pantry, opening the door with ease despite her size. She took a bite out of every packet and box inside, having a single mouthful of each kind of food. But, it was the wheel of cheese that got her attention. She pushed it off the shelf and it rolled towards the back door. Between Suu and Cailith, they broke the wheel down into smaller, more manageable pieces and attempted to smuggle them outside.\n\nAzalea had the bright idea to look for the attic, and use that as their “nest” for the night. Upstairs, the three of them found the door to the attic recessed into the ceiling. Cailith suggested getting a broom and using that to leap onto the rope attached to the door, pulling it down so it could be climbed. They searched a nearby cupboard, finding a broom, a toolbox and a mop.With Azalea and Suu holding the broom, Cailith ran up the handle and jumped for the rope...\n\nAnd missed, crashing back to the floor, breaking his leg. Azalea patched him up with a good heal check and a bit of magic. Then Cailith checked the toolbox and found a hammer and some nails. The idea had formed in their heads almost straight away. Together Cailith and Azalea swung the hammer, with Suu holding the nails. They nailed the handles of the mop and broom together.\n\nThey placed their new contraption to the door, Azalea ran up and grabbed into the rope. But, she lost her grip on the broom handle and was left dangling there. She reverted back into her normal form, pulling the door down, allowing Suu and Cailith to climb up. After grabbing some of the cheese, the three of them snuggled down in a bed of shredded paper and sawdust, with Azalea returning to her rat form.\n\nIt was at this point, the party questioned why Azalea hadn’t reverted to her normal form earlier.\n\nSession End\n\n\n**Post-Script, by Suu**\nThere you have it folks, the first installment in a likely weekly series, chronicling the adventures of these fine, incompetent fools.\nHopefully, you enjoyed it as much as we did. We were in stitches around the table for the majority of the session.\n\n\nWill the ‘Boring Guys’ do something useful?\nWill the Rat Pack find a way to return Cailith and Suu to their normal selves?\nFind out next week in:\n\n**The League of Incompetent Evil: Meridia’s Revenge.**",

        "text": "Hello again! This is a continuation of 'What we are in the Shadows Part 4 (What's up Doc?)' which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/46zt1k/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_4_whats/. Last time, the group had completed their first mission: Warning Doctor Samantha Hirsch of her impending assassination. Shockingly, this went off without a hitch. The team returned to their dwelling and reconvened with Ghost. The enigmatic mercenary congratulated his protegees/hapless strays before informing them of their next task: They would need to destroy a heavily guarded generator that was providing power to multiple mega-corporations. \n\nThis is where we find the intrepid band. Their once jovial teasing was conspicuously absent, replaced with  stunned silence. Ghost sat across from the team, his feet raised on the table. Though the wide brim of his hat had been pulled down across his face, the hint of a smirk was just visible beneath it. He waited patiently, enjoying the sudden lack of sound around him. The group glanced at each other, uncertain how to react. The hesitant air remained for several moments before it was broken by a chugging noise: Poindexter desperately draining every last drop of beer from his bottle. Ghost and the others stared at their friend as he slammed the empty glass container on the table, snatching Leilani's forsaken alcohol. While he gulped down the beer, the others exploded into action. \n\n\"What the fuck are you talking about!? We aren't ready for this kind of shit!\" Leilani roared as she slammed her hands against the table-top, her anger roaring forth like a dragon's fury. The veterinarian's pupils were dilated and the veins running across her skin bulged violently. Ghost smiled at her, doing his best to hide a growing unease. Hautangi started pacing angrily, muttering darkly beneath his breath. Nellie rocked backwards on her stool and started mouthing obscenities, her rage so overwhelming that she lost the capacity for rational thought. \n\n\"Good thing you're not going straight away. You've got a few weeks to prep for this one, as well as a full dossier on the place itself.\" Ghost tried to assuage the furious four but his attempts fell well short. They continued espousing their apocalyptic anger as Ben tried to drink himself into a stupor. After a minute of enduring their tantrums, Ghost's patience reached a rather definitive end. \"Sit down and shut the fuck up!\" The bellow that ripped through the barn was so shockingly out of character for Ghost that it achieved what his words alone might not have. With his reluctant wards quietened for now, the mercenary took a deep breath before he spoke again. \"You need to calm down. It's not like I'm kicking your asses to the curb and telling you to get it done. Leilani, you're right. This isn't like anything you've ever done but these are extreme circumstances. The only reason that any of you are still alive is because someone took an interest in you. If they say jump, you get out your tape measure for precision.\" \n\n\"Ghost.\" Everyone turned to Poindexter once more. The flabby man was staring at their mentor, his features schooled in rarely witnessed determination. \"I take it that you've got a plan. You wouldn't be bringing this up otherwise.\" Ghost grinned approvingly, tipping his hat to the alcoholic. \n\n\"Points to the fat man. Yes, I have a plan but it hinges on you lot being able to get it done. That's why I need you to be honest about what you can do; we only get one shot at this. If you screw it up, you're facing prison time or worse.\" Ghost plugged another data chip into the trideo projector. The green light flickered into existence once more, the hologram displaying a set of blueprints. \"This is the facility. It's surrounded by two meter tall razor-wire fences and has guards stationed at each entrance. There are patrols roving throughout the grounds and cameras observing nearly every damn inch of the place. On-site security forces are well-trained but if they can't handle a situation, they send for assistance from a nearby A.L.E. precinct.\" Ghost stood from his chair, his eyes twinkling with a sadistic delight. \"Now, pay attention. This is where it gets tricky.\" \n\nFast forward two weeks. Micheal and Gavin are the unlucky bastards who have drawn guard duty for the main entrance. No trids, no games and no unauthorized Trix access makes being chosen for the 'front door' duty the most agonizingly dull experience that a well-trained agent could hate. Even with a buddy to chat with, the night tended to drag on in a way not unlike watching paint dry. Tonight was especially painful. The third member of their trio, Ray, was nice and warm inside one of the security stations. While this would normally be cause for celebration, their usual hijinks were curtailed by the presence of their commanding officer. With the only contact being situation reports, Micheal and Gavin were approaching the point of I-Spy to pass the time.  It was for this exact reason that the duo said a silent prayer when they noticed a vehicle slowly approaching. They readied their weapons before pausing. \n\n\"Hello? Sorry, we broke down and we didn't know where we were. Can you help us?\" It must have been their lucky night: A buxom, beautiful woman was leaning out of the driver's side window. She had a plaintive expression across her pretty features and more than a little skin showing. A little heavy on the make-up, maybe, but gorgeous nonetheless. Her van, a beaten up relic, slid to a stop in front of them. Micheal realized right away why the vehicle had been moving so slowly: An obese, panting man had been pushing it up the hill. Collapsing from behind the van, the sweat-soaked individual began heaving for air. \"Oh my god, you're pathetic! We finally find someone who can help us and you can't even say hello?\" With a noise of pure disgust, the woman cracked open the door and stepped out. She was an heart-breaker alright, her bountiful curves wrapped in a clinging swim-suit. After such a painfully dull evening, she was sight for sore eyes. Her companion...less so.\n\n\"Hey...fellas.\" Each word was punctuated with an immense heaving breath that set his flabby frame wobbling. Grimacing at the unpleasant image, Gavin cleared his throat. \n\n\"Can we help you folks?\" The angel before him smiled beatifically, clasping her hands behind her back. \n\n\"Oh my gosh, you're so sweet! Thank you so much! Our van just broke down about a kilometer down the road and my useless husband couldn't get it going.\" She fluttered her eyelashes at him, her smile turning simpering. \"Is there anything you can do to help us?\" Gavin grinned, precious blood diverting from his primary brain to his secondary. Before he could open his mouth again, Micheal beat him to the punch.\n\n\"Sorry ma'am, we're not mechanics. We can call you a tow-truck or something but I don't think we can actually help.\" Though his tone was apologetic, Micheal's gaze was locked firmly on the cleavage on display; so much so that he almost missed the sniffling whimper the lady gave. \"I, uh...listen. We'll see what we can do. Just hold tight, okay?\" There was an instant turn around, her desolate demeanor giving way to a sunny smile.\n\n\"Thank you so much! You boys are amazing, not like fat-ass over there.\" She turned a scornful eye at the slowly recovering man. \"Why can't you be more like them?\" The boys were torn between smiling at their good fortune and wincing in sympathy. Still, his loss was their gain. \n\n\"Ah, don't worry about it. I'm sure he did the best he could.\" The subtle mockery did not go unnoticed by the couple, as the wife tittered and the husband muttered excuses. Sighing to himself, the down-trodden man began rooting around the van. He emerged with a worn tool-kit and started busying himself with repairing the engine. Gavin frowned, rubbing his forehead. \n\n\"Wait, are you actually a mechanic? Why do you need us to call someone?\" His voice held a suspicious tone, one hand straying to the firearm at his side. The stunning specimen of femininity laughed openly, covering her mouth with a hand.\n\n\"He already tried to fix it before! Do you really think this lazy bastard would have pushed us all this way if he had a chance in hell of getting the van going?\" The guards chuckled, ignoring a mumbled complaint. There humor faded when their commander's voice sounded in their ear-pieces. \n\n\"Report.\" Micheal cleared his throat before responding.\n\n\"Two civilians, sir. Their van broke down and they're looking for help.\" \n\n\"Then call them a tow-truck. This is private property. Try to remember that.\" Micheal rolled his eyes, doing his best to keep any scorn out of his voice.\n\n\"Yes sir. One of them is a mechanic, he's working on the fix now.\" There was a low sigh, an aggravated noise, over the line.\n\n\"Fine. Make sure he gets it done quickly. Roster rotation is in two minutes, so cyber-security will be down for two minutes. I don't want any screw-ups.\" Now Gavin scoffed, disgusted at the hyper-vigilance displayed by their superior. He turned away, lowering his voice.\n\n\"Sir, this is the same thing that happens every night. What does it matter? You think the swim-suit model and the lard-ball are going to try something?\" He almost recoiled as the answer came in a seething hiss.\n\n\"Need I remind you that this is your job, not a holiday at Titties Galore? You are here for security. Get your head in the game or I will find someone who can.\" The guards deflated at the declaration, falling back in line.\n\n\"Yes sir.\" The line went dead and Micheal sighed angrily. \"I'm afraid that you can't stay here. This is private property. I'm sorry, miss. Do you think your husband can fix the van?\" Nellie smiled back at him, malice lurking just beneath her beautiful exterior. \n\n\"He'll have to, won't he?\" Listening through the communication link the team had set up, Leilani smirked. She was situated half a kilometer down the road in a van, sitting across from Chrissie. While the anti-scrying mage did her thing, Leilani had been tasked with Matrix duty. While she had no particular skill with computers, the veterinarian was the most proficient of the team. Thus, she was in charge of monitoring digital traffic and making sure that the team was aware of their timetable. \n\n\"Alright, keep it up guys. Guard rotation is up in ninety six seconds. You're gonna have to draw some more attention in a minute. You good, big man?\" The only response was a series of quiet grumblings from their last team-mate. Leilani laughed at his pain and settled back in her seat to enjoy the show. Nellie and Ben took her advice to heart in the most spectacular way. After another snide comment from his 'wife', Poindexter started his own snide commentary.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I don't understand vapid blonde. Could you try English?\" Nellie gasped in exceptionally believable offense, holding a hand to her breast as if injured. Micheal and Gavin choked on their mirth, not ready for the rotund man's comeback. \n\n\"How dare you! You should be praying to God that someone pitied your ass enough to marry you! Do you have any idea how lucky you are!?\" \n\n\"I'm the lucky one? You don't do a damn thing but hang around with your girlfriends while I work my ass of to pay for everything!\" The argument roared, their voices swelling to greater heights. Soon, other guards were drawn to the area. In an night of boredom, this screaming match provided some much needed entertainment. Thankfully, it also provided a wonderful distraction for the last member of the team. Hautangi finally emerged from a series of thick foliage, covered in mud and twigs. The big Maori seethed quietly as he crawled across the dark ground. It took him little time to reach the razor wire fence, listening to Leilani in his ear.\n\n\"You're doing good, big man. Guards are being drawn by the others and the security network will be down in 3...2...1.\" Hautangi pulled a pair of bolt cutters from his satchel, quickly making a hole through the razor-wire. Even from his position, he could hear Poindexter and Nellie screaming at each other. The two of them were actually convincing everyone that this farce was real.\n\n\"Better them than me.\" It took some work but Hautangi managed to slip inside without setting anything off. The generators were easy to locate; destroying them would be the difficult part. \"Would have been, anyway. Thank you, Ghost.\" Hautangi quipped over the line as he pulled the last thing from his satchel: A timed charge. Ghost had explained that all the team would need to do would be to place it by the target, hit the button and run like hell. So that was exactly what Hautangi did. \"Alright, it's done. Now, if you'll excuse me: I'm getting the fuck out of here!\" \n\n\"Guys, time to go. Bombs gonna go off any time now.\" Hearing the warning through their comm-links, Nellie and Poindexter knew that it was time to leave. With a stroke of luck, the van's engine roared to life. \n\n\"Get in the damned van, you fucking harpy!\" Ben threw the tool-box back in the van before sliding into the driver's seat.\n\n\"I can't believe my mother was right about you!\" Nellie sneered, slamming the door shut on her way in. The van began trundling off, heading towards the extraction point for Hautangi. Everything had gone according to plan. Naturally, this was the time that something went wrong. That something? The bomb went off early. Hauntangi was barely out of the perimeter when the device detonated, the shockwave knocking him from his feet. While he was shaking that off, the con-man never saw the wave of electricity pass through him. Hautangi certainly felt it though, his limbs convulsing as the lightning struck him. It struck like the might of Thor, sending power coursing through every cell in his body and awakening something deep within him. His comm-link died and his bio-monitor short-circuited from the electricity. Leilani cursed, her heart pounding in her chest.\n\n\"Hautangi's vital signs just vanished. Get him out of there, now!\" Ben threw the van into reverse, roaring past the now chaotic power station. They slid into the bramble, knocking loose foliage and detritus away in a violent surge of steel. The vehicle squealed to a stop as Hautangi's prone form came into view, narrowly avoiding crushing the unconscious man. It took the combined efforts of Ben and Nellie to get him into the van but they managed it, the van tearing off into the distance as soon as possible. While the former event planner did her best to care for Hautangi, Poindexter drove recklessly towards the barn. They arrived in record time, well ahead of Leilani and Chrissie. The duo applied what they had learned from the training trids but they quickly realized that their patient required far more extensive medical treatment.\n\nLeilani and Ghost arrived at the same time, forgoing the traditional greetings. Though her skills were more suited to the treatment of animals, Hautangi was close enough for it to be effective. His wounds were treated to the best of her abilities and whatever medical supplies they actually had. Once she was finished, Ghost demanded an answer for what had happened. The trio gave their accounts of the event but no-one was able to determine the cause of Hautangi's injuries. Ghost was furious at the Maori's condition but relieved that the job had gone off without a hitch. He gave them a single-use comm-link and told them to call him if anything changed. For now, they were to keep training and look after the idiot.\n\nTwo days passed without incidence. The trio exercised, fervently studied the medical programs and took turns monitoring Hautangi. It was during Poindexter's shift that his charge began to awaken. Calling out in excitement, Ben made the mistake of leaning over the semi-conscious form. Hautangi awakened slowly, blurry images and muffled sounds coming to him piece by piece. The very first thing that he saw was his raised hand, a shimmering blue energy surrounding his hand  The second thing was Poindexter turning blue, his hands struggling futilely at something around his throat. It took a few seconds for Hautangi to understand that he was responsible. As soon as the thought sprang into his mind, the glow around his hand faded. Ben collapsed in a heap, like a puppet whose strings had been cut. Hautangi peered around groggily, asking the most important question on his mind.\n\n\"Anyone got a fucking drink?\" \n\nAnd that's the story of how Hautangi awakened into a Mystic Adept.  ",

        "text": "So, I just got home from a DnD game today, and there was so much ridiculousness that I just had to recount it somewhere. First time posting in this subreddit, so apologies if there are issues with formatting and such.\n\nThis is not the first chapter of this campaign, and I might go back and write some of those shenanigans up at some point as well.\n\n**Quick campaign backstory:** All of our characters (except the Cleric) were ripped from our normal lives by some malfunctioning magic and teleported to the capital city of a nation ruled over by some sort of very powerful God-King (specific details are a bit fuzzy and not really relevant to this chapter). We are not allowed to leave the borders of this nation, and only managed to not be thrown into slavery as a reward for helping a guard captain with a personal mission of his. We now work various odd-jobs in the city and are trying to plot our way out and possibly eventually how to overthrow the God-King at some point.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nUlaan - TN Half-Elf Ranger (my character so I know a little more about backstory and such for him): former army scout, one of countless grandchildren of a Genghis Khan-type warlord in a distant land, served as a travelling ambassador of sorts before falling in with this group. Kinda grim and grumpy. Has taken somewhat of a liking to the detective-style work that's made up the two main quests so far [past couple of sessions kinda played out like Law &amp; Order: DnD]. Would be LN, but the backstory rolls for his background introduced some story elements that I liked, and spun as him having deep misgivings for command blindly following orders.\n\nDirk - CN Half-Orc Barbarian: Big guy, not overly bright. Fan of smashing things and not being stuck in the city. He and Ulaan have found some success working as hunters/trappers during downtime. Outlander background, I believe. Likes animals, and dislikes those who are cruel towards them (hunting for necessity is different, and must be treated with a certain amount of reverence)\n\nDeceit - TN? Tiefling Warlock: A Tiefling woman pretending to be a man, as she's originally from a very patriarchal society. Very bitter and misanthropic, often impatient and selfish. Clever and charming when she wants to be, but is rather a poor diplomat/face due to her personality. Often threatens fireball enemas when intimidating/interrogating.\n\nTrevor - CN? Half-Elf Cleric: Serves a trickster god, I'm not 100% of which god it is, gods are pretty fluid in this DM's setting (plus, worship of gods that aren't the God-King is somewhat frowned upon in this nation). Basically functions more as a rogue for non-combat skills, while still being a healer, etc. in combat. The only character native to the region. His player joined at the final part of the first story arc, and Trevor was rescued from a den of giant spiders as part of the quest we were on. He was sent there in the first place for basically being an anti-government rabble-rouser. Exaggerated emo-kid traits, vocally anti-authority (which is pretty dumb in a dictatorship like this); urchin background - lived in and around ~~sewers~~ Storm Drains! all his life, and can often be found working with the poor/homeless living in those drains, both recruiting anti-authority allies, and building his own little thieves network.\n\nForsetti - LG Human Paladin: Not sure which god, pretty standard character right now because his player is new to the game and using a pre-built character for this arc, he'll customize him a bit more once he's got a bit better grasp of the game. For now, one trait that's emerged is that he's very much a ladies man.\n\n**Where we left off during the previous session**\n\nAs part of our partnership with the city guards (most of whom are decent people, especially our Captain friend and his subordinates), we were asked to investigate what looked to be a cult-related murder. We had to be retroactively deputized after we snuck into the crime scene and were attacked by monsters, thus causing a very obvious disturbance. We ended the last session following up on a lead that took us to an inn, somehow managing to avoid combat through most of the session with some lucky rolls during roleplaying portions. After scouting out the place, we came back during a quiet part of the day to poke around. The innkeeper, Simms, was very much a cultist, and reacted to our discovery by trying to throw a bunch of alchemist fire at us - we had some lucky rolls and managed to keep the jars he tried to throw at us from breaking. We subdued him, and were in the process of disarming the traps he had set up in his room upstairs when when we hear something knock down the lobby door.\n\n**Today's Session Begins Here**\n\nTrevor sprang into action quickly, spilling his bag of ball bearings down the stairs, everyone else takes defensible positions as best they can in the narrow hallway, trying not to get stuck in the room full of alchemist fire traps. The first armoured construct-thing rounded the corner of the stairs and tripped on the ball bearings, toppling back down the stairs onto the second, and knocking over several skeletons that were in tow. From the bottom of the stairs, the party hears a lot of swearing [DM was playing this character pretty much as Hunter Gathers from the Venture Bros, if you're familiar with the show at all, so picture that sort of voice].\n\n...The thing about this city, is that the City Guard uses these armoured constructs and skeletons to do most of the fighting, with a few actual guardsmen to organize them and do the talking. We had just bowled over a whole group of our ostensible allies [Best Heroes!]. Ulaan and Forsetti call out to the guard at the bottom of the stairs, and once again manage to de-escalate the situation. Trevor apologizes and starts picking his ball bearings back up downstairs, as we help the guard get the constructs and skeletons back on their feet. This guardsman is not familiar with us or our investigation, he was called because some of the lodgers were frightened by our brawl subduing Simms. He wants to take the lot of us in for questioning. Deceit had been ~~hiding~~ [stealth roll failed: hiding poorly] around a corner with the restrained innkeeper. As is usual for her charming self, she squabbled with the guardsman, and just about got us in more trouble, before it was decided that we'd send for Captain Vic, who tasked us with this investigation. Trevor meanwhile slipped away and hid in the nearby alley during this confusion.\n\nVic's right and left hands, Pip and Leon came in his stead, and sorted things out with this guard (with occasional glances our way, and much head shaking - especially as Deceit continued to bicker with them about proper evidence procedure [namely that we weren't allowed to just wantonly loot stuff from this place]). After we left to go interrogate the innkeeper back at the station, Trevor comes back in, bluffs his way into getting a long-term lodger to refund him \"the deposit on a long-term stay room that he had just paid for with the innkeeper\" from the Simms' strongbox. But the lodger is smart enough to take the rest of the money into his own temporary possession, because Trevor definitely looks like he'd come swipe the rest of the money otherwise [Best heroes!].\n\nSimms is handed over to a scientist sort of fellow named Dipple that works for Vic. Simms had adamantly refused to cooperate before when we asked him questions. Dipple's eccentric, but he's helped us before. He seems entirely too gleeful to get a chance to use his interrogation techniques. We rest in an nearby room. Just before dawn, Dipple and Vic call us into the room so that we can get our answers. Dipple's technique involved maiming Simms pretty severely in order to install devices that would cause him extreme agony. Harsh, but considering that time is of the essence, and more murders are likely, maybe necessary. As we're about to start asking questions, Trevor, having rested, says \"Hey guys, I'll throw up a Zone of Truth!\" [basically, creatures in the zone can't lie - though they can still be evasive]... meaning that we probably didn't need to maim Simms to get the truth out of him. [Best Heroes!] Deceit fawns over Dipple's torture contraption... [Best Heroes!].\n\nSimms tells us the info we need about the cult, but also taunts us that because we decided to come back in the afternoon instead of confronting him the previous night, he had carried out the ritual killings he was tasked with. So while Dirk and Forsetti were drinking and finding *companions* for the night, and the rest of us opted to rest up, people were dying horribly. **[BEST HEROES!]** Simms then tells us that the ritual has three parts: the first killings we investigated, the ones he committed last night, and a third set that must occur at dawn at the end of the third night (current time: ***shortly before dawn***).\n\nWe get the address of the third conspirator and ~~make all haste towards it.~~ Wind ourselves badly trying to get there as swiftly as we can. [Skill challenge: Athletics - Run, Heroes, Run! - Failures mean that we'll arrive later and thus have less time to intervene. Skill rolls were made. Skill rolls were failed, badly. Best Heroes!] We opt to push through, gaining the exhaustion status, rather than chancing that we'll arrive late. One bit of fortune though, in the early morning, an old man is driving a covered wagon through the quiet street. Using our authority as deputies, we commandeer the wagon. Mostly, we scare the poor old guy and he runs off rather than trying to fight the pack of lunatics accosting him [Best Heroes!].\n\nUlaan takes the reins [*Party is exhausted: all skill checks at disadvantage*]. Wagon goes careening through street wildly. Dirk is bucked out. Ulaan slows down enough for Dirk to jump back on. Dirk misjudges and lands under the back wheel. Ulaan opts to take the delay to let Dirk just get back on. Dirk helps Ulaan with the Animal Handling to remove the disadvantage [Roll: 2 + 4 AH skill = C'mon, really!?]. Wagon crashes into a fountain, completely wrecked. Horse is sadly killed in the accident [Best Heroes!].\n\nUlaan is a little fuzzy after the wreck, but comes to in the fountain, and gets a face-full of now-pantsless Dirk. [Dirk's player remembered that all characters except for Ulaan were carrying a jar of Alchemist's Fire from the inn's traps on their person... crud. Trevor's was in a bag of holding - no risk of damage. Deceit and Forsetti pass their saves to keep the jars from breaking, Dirk failed his roll]\n\n[Just before Ulaan came to...] Dirk finds in the fountain after the sudden wagon crash. Dirk feels cold and wet, but also feels some crunchy broken glass in his belt pouch, and something goopy soaking into his pants. [Dirk's player passes an insight check - quite a feat, as wisdom is not really Dirk's strong point] Dirk remembers Bossy-Robe-Man [Deceit] telling him that if the red stuff inside the little jars touched the air, it would make a big fire really fast. Dirk does not want to be on fire, so he takes his pants off in a hurry. But wait, pants float! [Dirk passes another insight], Dirk weighs his pants down with a broken chunk of statue. Problem solved! Good job Dirk! Clock is still ticking on the sacrifice, so we pull ourselves together and make one last sprint towards the address (not far now, thankfully). [We kinda just leave these potentially very dangerous pants just sitting there for the next poor hapless sap that visits the fountain. ...Best Heroes!]\n\nPicture this: You're a cultist assigned to sit as a watch inside the house of a fellow cultist, basically to delay anyone looking for him long enough to allow the ritual complete. It's been a very quiet night. You slice yourself an apple while rocking back in your chair. Suddenly the door is blown off its hinges, you see the foot of a big, angry-looking, soggy, naked Half-Orc as the cause of this. You, quite understandably, lose your focus and fall backwards out of your chair. The Half-Orc bellows something about pants and continues charging into the house. A couple of equally soggy, though less naked Half-Elves follow, one points at you and shouts, \"Get him, we need answers!\" Behind him, a strange figure wrapped up in thick robes follows, raises a wand towards you, and before you have a chance to protest any of this, fires a bolt at you, instantly exploding your head.\n\n[Deceit had cast Witch Bolt, hoping to use its ongoing effect for some \"motivation\" during interrogating this guy. But, she rolled a critical hit, and did enough damage to one-shot this guy instead]. We didn't even get a good enough look at the guy before it happened to know if it was the guy we were looking for. \n\n*Deceit, to Ulaan: \"Your witness, detective.\"*\n \nUlaan stands there agape and blood-spattered. As the kids these days would say, he can't even right now.\n\n[BEST HEROES!]\n\n[At this point, the DM is thoroughly exasperated - actually kinda satisfying. We were supposed to interrogate that guy and get critical information to continue the plot. We spent a solid 15 minutes laughing at just how spectacularly the night had been going] \n\nOur target was a very big stonemason, this guy was pretty scrawny, so it wasn't him. Thankfully, in looking for some pants Dirk finds a [very conveniently placed] note, detailing that this guy was guarding the entrance to the temple where the final sacrifice was to take place. \"Wait, guarding the temple!? The entrance is here! Find it! Find it! Find it!\" [Investigation checks begin - party is still exhausted and rolls skill checks at disadvantage] Our Noble and Skillful Heroes are literally ripping the place apart looking for anything that might help us. We fail miserably. In-game time: ~ 7 minutes [seven group skill checks, yeah, we failed that many]. We end up really wrecking the place as we get more and more thorough. Forsetti falls out of the second storey window somehow during all of this [Best Heroes!]. Finally, we find the secret mechanism. Somehow, in tossing the books off of the bookcase, Dirk had missed that there was still one sitting there. Pulling it causes the fireplace to open and reveal a hidden staircase down.\n\nBy some miracle, it looks like the victims are still moving around - the sacrifice probably hasn't happened yet! [remember that being undead is a possibility, so there is a chance that we were that late] Five cultists are in the hidden chamber, including our quarry. Roll for initiative! [We did finish the combat, more or less, but this has already been a fairly long story, and I should go to bed].\n\n\n[Edit: I've written up the combat here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/48f0lv/5e_best_heroes_battling_the_cultists/]",

Sometimes it does not. Gather round, and hear my tale about one of those times it goes... well... you'll see.\n\nMost of the party had already done a mission together, the start of our new campaign. The party consisted of a bonnafide Hawkman (complete with mace and sizable intimidation buffs), a half demon wizard, and apparently a bronzed Adonis. \n\nI, however, was a guardsman. And I was doing what I did best, guarding the gate from strange types. These guys classified as strange.\n\nThe pretty one asked where they were, which I thought to be rather strange. I told him as much, along with the name of the town. He informed me that they had been in a minor battle but it was of no matter, and to let him and his companions in. As one was still slightly smoldering, I thought it best to keep the obvious ruffians out. \"You look quite dangerous,\" I informed them, \"and we don't want your trouble following you through this gate. Sorry.\"\n\nThe party was clearly not pleased.\n\n\"Please, kind guardsman. All we ask is to be lead to the nearest inn,\" said the shiny one, drawing several gold coins from his pouch. \"And I promise I will PERSONALLY make it worth your while.\" He ended his sentence with a hair flick.\n\nThe player rolled for diplomacy. With a +4 diplomacy buff, this should be a sinch, especially since my own character would definitely be down for a good bribe.\n\nHe rolled a 2.\n\nNoticing the golden hair flick, I can only respond \"Oh... Oh. While I'm quite flattered, I don't quite go that way. But cheers to you be being so open!\"\n\nNeedless to say, our Aasimar did not like me much after that.",

The dragonborn flies up and sees a group of hobgoblins, and I forgot what he wanted to do but it basically amounted to raining death on them. I ask if he wants to look for his 100k of stolen gold, he's like \"yeah, what do I see\" \"they are definitely not carrying 100k of gold on them do you want to talk to them?\" \"sure I fly down to them\" ... \"by yourself?\"\n...\"I fly back to the rest of the party.\" Next comes a fireball and some epic murder then they take the warlord alive and proceed to waterboard him with the help of their cleric of life. They throw him into the bag of devouring because murder-hobos. They go to the keep the dragonborn flies up decides to use his magical amulet again and floods the keep drowning 25 hobgolins in half-plate and 6 worgs. He then dive tackles the hobgoblin captain off the 40ft wall, and I'm not kidding when I say he had 1 hit point left after that fall. So our rogue who is a poisoner assassin, who still hasn't poisoned anybody decides now is the time and slips him a cyanide pill. I mention this might be the most brutal death in the campaign. Why? they ask me why? because you just murder all of his friends his 6 pet dogs and then with him not even able to stand let alone fight you give him a horribly painful slow death that's why. I take on a blubbering voice \"don't worry boys(worgs) I'm coming to join you soon: Fluffly, Maimer, Killboner, Cuddles, Freddy, and Leg-Humper (awesome death gurgle). \"But since they were evil were not evil right?\" \"You would have lost your paladinship if you had taken paladin last level.\" \"So how are you gonna get the gold from the flooded fort?\" The warforged wedges one of the vertical logs used in the wall off and this tree sized log falls on him and the water washes the rest downhill for the LULZ. \n\nThey then head back down the mountain and as they turn a corner they see 17 hippogriffs. They bitch hard about it being too many enemies I ask them to make a perception check, they succeed and see a giant mountain of stone overhanging the road above the hippogriffs the same stone they passed on the way up, they also hear a faint cooing coming from the top of the stone and they panic thinking it's more enemies. How are we gonna get passed them without a fight. I casually suggest that our dragonborn uses his amulet again with its earthquake spell. the precipice starts to tip and just before it hits a single hippogriff passes its perception check warns the others and turns to flee before BOOM all you hear is an earth shattering kaboom from the giant stone crushing the hippogriffs and blocking the road, congratulations on your second genocide of today. But hippogriffs are violent evil monsters, no they're peaceful they are half horse after all. roll a perception check...pass. you hear frantic cooing coming down the new slope and see 5 hippogriff pups sliding to their doom. \"OH NO, what will we do?\", says the WINGED dragonborn. So after a good face-palming he swoops in catches four misses the 5th one, 3 in his arms and 1 with his tail (which I forgot he didn't have a tail, but in my defense it was getting tense) so our other winged character dives and catches the last one mid-fall. I however, did remember he just lost one of his wings \nin a fight the other day and he plummets, but is okay, and yes the pup survived too. \"you bastard, you fucking bastard\" my best friend laughs.\n\nI then proceed to explain to them the concept of murder-hobo.",

        "text": "Our talk concluded Khan and I part as he heads back to his crew, while I with my guarded entourage inspect the rest of the ship for clues regarding Fell.  We go immediately to the Captain’s quarters, only to find it burnt to cinders.  It would appear Fell’s associates are loyal to the end, using their last moments to destroy any evidence that will incriminate their Lord.  I suppose that is somewhat admirable - albeit damn annoying.\n\nMoving on we find the acting commander’s quarters - the woman whose fate was sealed the moment she fell into Karn’s bloody hands.  Sorting through her belongings I finally learn her name - Lady Ash - but is little too late.  However, I come across some of her leather bound journals, hidden well amidst her personal effects.\n\nInside are notes describing her powers, detailing her progress as she pushed the boundaries of what she could do.  While her unnatural gifts appear to have aligned with ‘telekinesis’, even with a quick scan it is apparent her findings will be of untold value to one like myself.  The seals which she wore as apart of her attire for example hid her witch-like aura, preventing her from general suspicion.  Without a second thought I collect her journals, ready to study them in depth later.\n\nWith no more information to glean here I reunite with my companion Zez, after her business on Khan’s ship is finished, and move on to the other captured vessel, the Gilded Vision.  Once aboard, Zez assists me with my search before tending to her own duties.  In contrast to the functional design of the other vessel, the Guided Vision is completely adorned with lavish displays of wealth, along with garish, over the top gestures.  In the Inquisitor’s office the walls are literally lined with gold, reflecting in the light alongside other trinkets.  The whole charade is tacky and a waste of resources.  I can see why Fell took a liking to this man; they have the same embarrassing sense of taste.\n\nAs predicted no traces of our adversary can be found once again.  I am forced to give Fell the credit of hiding his tracks well, but the esteemed Inquisitor isn't quite as professional.  On a discarded data slate I come across a list of names and crew sent to infiltrate our ship, as well as others past, which will help see that the last of the spies are purged.  Further digging through the old man's journals help me understand his pathetic, laborious story.\n\nHe grew up using money as a crutch, being useless and unskilled, with no success wherever he went.  That is, until he met Fell.  After that fateful day the Inquisitor’s trophy room started to fill, taking down noble and trader alike - who of course just so happened to be in Fell’s way.  I very much doubt talking to him will provide many answers.  Being the age he is, his arrogance will certainly prevent him from seeing sense.  Nevertheless, I will do my best to try.\n\nI follow Zez around after collecting bits and pieces from this ship, watching as she patches up the damage enough to make it back to port.  After her lightning fast repairs we both contact the teleportarium to beam us back  over.\n\nI find the Barron waiting for me as we arrive back safely, finally parting from Zez’s side to explain my findings with the old Seneschal in private.  I provide him the details he needs to ensure that our ship will be spy free by the time we make port, as he sends his own men to take care of the problem.\n\n“I would like to have a word with you sir, about the Inquisitor and his crew.”  The Barron settles into his quarters.  “What are your intentions for him?”\n\n“The Inquisitor is a joke.”  I say, folding my arms.  “He isn’t like the rest of Fell’s crew.  He is delusional.  He feels as if he has some sort of control.”  In reality he is probably Fell’s least trusted pawn.\n\n“What if he’s not useful sir?” The Barron asks, looking concerned.\n\nI tap the holster at my side.  “Then I’ll take care of it personally.”\n\n“If we take him into Imperial space, we may have some issues.  I think it’s better to assess this, sooner rather than later.”\n\nTaking this on board I nod, informing the Barron to bring the prisoner to the meeting room for interrogation.  I wait there alone until the old man is lead in, beaten down in clothes flashy and exuberant.  I stand behind my usual seat at the table as the guards sit Aeskepolis down at the foot of the table, in one of the chairs saved specifically for this sort of practice.\n\n“How dare you treat me this way!”  He bellows, his saggy jowls shaking with anger.\n\nI wave my hand, signalling the guards to leave.  “Quiet old man.”  Slowly, I walk over to where he is seated.  “You have no idea who you’re addressing do you?”\n\n“Bah!”  He spits, “Someone clearing dabbling in heresy to incarcerate an Inquisitor of the Inquisition!”\n\nHis response - while predictable - makes me chuckle.  The word ‘heresy’ is thrown around a great deal, at least by the zealous.  I know that despite his misconceptions his accusations are technically not wrong.  I’m very much aware of how careful I need to tread.  What strikes me as laughable whenever I hear that word, is how blind those who throw it around so casually are to their own actions.\n\n“Isn’t using your title for personal gain just as corrupt?”  The whole Inquisition is a farce.  “You became an Rogue Trader’s dog.  It’s hard to take anyone so pathetic seriously.”\n\n“There is no proof.”  The Inquisitor narrows his eyes, lips pursed tightly.\n\n“Don’t be so sure about that.” I pace around him slowly.   “I have proof.”\n\n“What proof?”  He demands, calling my bluff.\n\n“While your journals aren’t hard evidence on their own,” I begin, “there were some interesting findings on the other ship that didn’t burn quite as well as Fell would have liked.”  I slam my hand on the table as Aeskepolis’ head spins, looking me directly in the eye.  “The only way you’re getting out of this alive is if you throw Fell into the fire.”\n\nThe Inquisitor blubbers.  “You wouldn’t dare kill me!”  His stammering is not out of fear, but of frustration.  He actually believes that his life is safe.\n\nIf he doesn’t testify against Fell, then we have no credible evidence to prove his guilt.  If we have no evidence to incriminate Fell, then we cannot draw suspicion upon ourselves by having loose ends left untied.\n\nIn a last ditch effort I throw my family’s seal out of my pocket in front of him.  “You seem to think that your title and status raise you above everyone old man - but look upon my sigil.  I outrank you in every way.  My family have reputable business’, more wealth than you could ever hope to plaster across your ship, and enough influence to even ensure that you live after all you have done.  Confess your dealings with Fell, and your fall from grace will be as honorable as we can muster.”\n\n“Honorable?!”  He folds his arms and turns away.  “To work with a heretic like you?”\n\nThe hypocrisy boils my blood.  I turn, striking him across the face.  “You worked with a witch cult for countless years!”  I take a breath, straightening myself out to regain my composure.  “Are you really going to die for Fell?  Let him manipulate you to the very end?”  I march over to the other end of the table, standing in front of my Lord’s usual chair, hand poised over the red button elegantly carved into the table.  “This is your final chance.”\n\nAeskepolis peers over at me, his old jaded eyes filled with pride.  “You won’t kill me.”\n\nI sigh.\n\n“Very well.”  I let my hand fall, pressing the button that usually ends interrogations held in this room.  The Inquisitor’s seat falls below the floor, dropping the old man into a chute before returning to its usual position.  His cries echo as he is emptied out of the ship, into the vacuum of space.\n\nThis makes it a draw.  Neither my Lord nor Fell could emerge victorious, but I won’t let him slip away so easily next time.  We may have lost all proof, but we managed to win the treasure - as well as two ships - from our rival, all the while destroying his schemes and contacts.  We can afford this minor setback.\n\nIn fact, we are stronger than ever before.  With both the remains of the Inquisition and the cult taken care of, I have only one more thing I must do before I can officially declare this mission over.\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/43ljsf/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_18/) | Next | Last",

With a dozen people, however, this meant that every combat segment took half an hour. I knew this would all collapse in on itself and that the plot was going nowhere, so why not have a bit of fun before the game ends? I decided I was going to build an army. An army of the people, for the people. Lead by an evil chef and his raven familiar. \n\nUsing nothing but the spell open and close because I was a sorcerer who didn't take magic missile. I was a chef, ok? It didn't feel in-character, even if I was evil. \n\nWe had a pretty standard chaotic neutral rogue in our party. He was a standard rogue; in it for the treasure, lovable bastard, the works. He'd been making quite a bit of money as a local pickpocket in the town square. \n\n&gt;Z: Can I make you a proposition? \n\n&gt;R: Sure. What do you have in mind?\n\n&gt;Z: Well, you see, I have a very special request. With some very special pay. Money is no object since I've purchased half the town's entertainment. How does 200 gold to prick people's necks with a needle instead of cutting their pockets sound?\n\n&gt;R, while visibly confused:  I guess that's fair. Though I have no idea why you'd want to throw your gold away. \n\nTen rolls with a +5 to sleight of hand later, he'd pricked the necks of seven people without being caught. \n\nI then stood on top of the fountain, force choked someone, and claimed to be god. \n\nSee, the familiar is an extension of the soul. You always have a sense as to where your familiar is, no matter how far. I'd asked my DM if that applied to all parts of the familiar, at all times. He'd agreed that that made sense, as long as they were close by and had died or fallen off recently. \n\nI'd taken feathers from my raven, burned them, then collected the ashes and mixed them with glue, coating the tip of some needles I'd bought from a local blacksmith earlier that day. When the rogue had pricked their necks, some of the glue rubbed off around their trachea. I then applied roughly [fifteen pounds of force](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Open/Close) to their windpipe, causing them to choke. \n\n&gt;DM: At this point, I don't even care. Roll for intimidate. \n\nI think the dice gods had stopped caring as well; they just wanted this abomination of a table to be disbanded before the sheer concentration of neckbeard caused the doritos to collapse in on themselves. \n\n&gt;17\n\nEverybody in the town square immediately took heed, either running and screaming or bowing down. I then used my massive pools of money to equip them for war and rush down the big alien landing force that they're spied off in the distance long ago. And that was the end of the campaign in three sessions. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/480img/rogue_trader_grimgar_rightoof_the_one_ork_waaagh/",
        "text": "I suppose the best place to start any tale is to introduce the character it's about.  This particular story is about a Sanctioned Xenos Ork named Grimgar Rightoof, who was on a WAAAGH for the \"God Emprah of 'Umie-Kind\".  How this came about is a long and arduous tale, and this story is not about how he decided to fight for the God Emperor.  This, my friends, is a story about how he met and befriended a cargo hold full of children.\n\nGrimgar had been employed by a Rogue Trader to be big, dumb, muscle aboard a frigate called 'Level With Me'.  Grimgar was excellent at this job, because it required the use of the skills he had gained over a lifetime of being big, dumb, muscle that fought almost constantly.  Day in and day out, Grimgar roamed the corridors of the 'Level With Me' constantly on the lookout for things to fight.  His favorite things to fight were daemons, since no one complained about him killing those. In fact, they thanked him for doing it and made sure his pet squig got fed on time while he was off ship with the Lord Captain.\n\nIn this way, the crew of the Level With Me began to trust Grimgar more and more.  They saw him less as a dangerous beast that might eat them, and more as a giant green thing that would help them kill daemons when the Gellar fields failed.  For his part, Grimgar began to see the crew as pale, runty Orks, and was determined to toughen them up a bit so they too could join in the fun that was daemon killing.  Eventually, they even trusted him enough to allow him to be alone with children.\n\nI can't claim to know what my GM was thinking at the time he did this, what scheme he had planned to cause me pain, all I can do is record what happened the first time Grimgar heard children screaming from inside a hold while he was on patrol.  Now normally in a situation like this, Grimgar would continue on his way and let someone else take care of it.  However, the rest of the player characters were in the Medical Bay after a particularly nasty run through a burning space station, so it fell to him to be that someone else to take care of it.\n\nGrumbling slightly, he hauled open the door of the bay and in my best Orkiest voice called out, \"OI!  WUTZ'ALL DIS DEN, HUH?\"  Or he would have, had he not immediately caught the 42nd millenium of a Soccer ball with his face.\n\nThere stood an 8 foot tall, 300 pound genetically perfected killing machine, a group of twelve children, and a soccer ball that was slowly rolling away.  All was silent in that hold, you could almost hear a pin drop.  Grimgar stared at the children.  The children stared back at Grimgar.  I stared at my GM.  My GM stared back at me.  The table waited with bated breath for the fate that would befall those soccer playing children.\n\nI reached for my dice without breaking eye contact with my GM.  I was the first to break the silence, declaring, \"I'm going to try and Charm the children.\"  In my mind, the rest of the players gasped in shock, but in reality, they laughed.  Because I had never bothered to spend experience on Charm.  I had never needed it, Grimgar got by just fine by yelling at people.  This meant that I would have to roll incredibly low to succeed at this, and not scar a room full of children for life.  I let the dice fall, and rolled a perfect 01 for my Charm attempt.\n\nFor the next few in game years, whenever Grimgar had the chance he would go and play soccer with those kids.  If they didn't want to play that, they played 'Beakies and Orkz', where the kids would pretend to be Space Marines trying to defend the hold from an Ork 'invasion'. I liked the RP that came from it, and everyone seemed to enjoy seeing the Ork telling a bunch of kids about the time that he ran away from Lion'El Johnson.  So of course, this being WH40k, it all had to come to a fiery, screaming end.\n\nIt started simply enough, the Gellar Field had started to fluctuate, so all hands needed to be on guard.  And then, the gellar field lost all power for one minute.  It turns out in a previous voyage we had picked up a daemon, and it was biding its time to just screw everything up, as daemons do.  It had succeeded in the worst kind of way for us.  This meant that it was Grimgar's time to shine.\n\nPlaying an Ork with a Sanctified Choppa in an enclosed space against a horde of daemons is still one of my favorite memories.  Grimgar went through his assigned decks like Taco Bell through the human digestive tract.  Deck by deck the player characters cleared the ship of daemonic taint, but none of them did it with Grimgar's level of speed.  Maybe if they had, this story would have a happy ending.\n\nAs it stands, however, Grimgar was the first to reach the hold where he played with those children.  Grimgar was the first to haul open the door, and the first to see what had happened to his 'umie runts.  Twelve daemons waited for him there, each wrapped in the flesh of the children.  It was a short fight, but for the first time Grimgar didn't feel any joy in battle.  The Gellar field was restored, the ship returned to normal, and Grimgar kept 12 charms with him at all times from then on.",

        "text": "So I just started playing in a D&amp;D campaign, and after only one session (tonight was the beginning) it has proven to be the most interesting campaign yet.\n\nI'm playing a male human wizard named Surthiden (Surt for short). I was tasked by the archmage of my academy with the delivery of a scroll to Sir Gareth, a man with whom I had no familiarity whatsoever. So I took a fairly straight road, and after about a day of walking I set up camp, started reading a book, and eventually fell asleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, all my possessions were gone, save for my shirt and pants, the scroll, and one of my socks (don't ask why; my DM is probably certifiably psychotic). With nothing else to do, no woods to forage for food in, no one in sight for miles, I set off, and after about another day I arrived at the city of Townville (again, crazy DM).\n\nStill in my disheveled and threadbare appearance, I sought directions to the police, as DM has seen fit to call them. Finding the police station, I knocked and asked for Sir Gareth, and was pointed tersely in his direction, after which the door was slammed in my face. I was slightly bored and decided to have a little fun.\n\nKnocking on the door again, I yanked off my remaining sock and hurled it into the guard's face, and made a break for it. Of course, he caught up with me and gave me a sound beating. After which he stuffed the sock into my mouth. I stood up, angrily removed the sock from my face, and flipped the guy off as he left. Of course someone had to say something, and the now-thoroughly pissed off guard chased me back down and slapped me across the face, hard enough to leave a palm-shaped imprint.\n\nAnd that's my most interesting D&amp;D story ever!",

        "text": "Three months ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3t1eq7/the_dance_of_bryce_strider_or_how_the_npc_i_tried/) story, and the following is loosely related.\n\nI mentioned in the above-linked story that in an *Out of the Abyss* game I'm currently playing I was playing the newest incarnation of my 'iconic character', Bryce Strider, as a half-elf swashbuckler. As one can assume he is a charismatic swordsman with a pretty face and his whole adventuring career ahead of him; or so I thought.\n\nAfter leaving Gracklstugh as secret allies of the authorities there, and with them faking our deaths to put off the drow chasing us, Bryce began to be plagued by nightmares. Originally a merciful, idealistic gladiator, Bryce had an outburst after seeing Demogorgon for the first time (rolled insanity and got essentially \"berserker rage\") and long-term it had been making him more and more violent. After backstabbing a corrupt guard who had asked for mercy, the paladin of the party began hating him, and he began having nightmares about the new violence he had been instilling.\n\nWell it gets worse, they docked on a landing off the Dark Lake and a pair of horrifying monsters-one large, one small-emerged and rushed the party. Bryce won initiative (as usual) and immediately decapitated the larger of the two, only for the illusion to despell and it revealed to be a little girl and the now-decapitated pregnant mother of said girl. Bryce rolls on the insanity chart again and gets shaky hands (disadvantage on all attack rolls, STR saving throws, DEX saving throws) for the next three days.\n\nBryce doesn't want to go along now but the Bard convinces him to investigate the source of the atrocity, so they go, and are met by a cave-in. A side passage lead to a set of moist ruins, they encounter a Grey Ooze which Bryce and the others dispatch, Bryce using a dagger instead of any of the three various swords as he felt he was not worthy of them.  They are then attacked by a Gelatinous Cube, which engulfs the party Druid and the Paladin. The Druid falls unconscious and the the Paladin manages to get him out, but in an effort to save his friends he drew his new Adamantine blade and fought the Cube. It engulfed him and he too fell unconcious. The remaining party members dispatched the Cube and healed Bryce and the Druid back up to full-health, but the DM is using the alternate rule of debilitating injuries after every person falls below 0hp.\n\nHe ruled that Bryce and the Druid lost all their hair and have disfigured, crinkled skin, giving them advantage on intimidate checks but disadvantage on persuasion checks (one of his Expertise skills). So now the striker/face of the party is unable to fight properly and ugly until we can find a cleric/wizard that can cast Regenerate (a level 7 spell) in the Underdark.\n\nHis optimism and idealistic attitude have melted away, he keeps himself covered and cloaked, and his slight self-doubt has become almost crippling. Up until now he was religious and pantheistic, now I'm thinking he'll drop from Chaotic Good to Chaotic Neutral as well as becoming an anti-theist as the gods have never actually answered his prayers, He's not Bryce anymore, until at least his face returns or things begin to look up enough to break him out of the stupor, now he's just \"Strider\".",

        "text": "Bob the cornac brawler was travelling to New Hope one day when he was approached by a panicked commoner. He was covered in sweat and was babbling about some kind of beast in the lumberjack village to the north. Bob calmly vowed to save the village from this beast. He made his way over - it wasn't far.\n\nHe shoved past the panicked commoners in the narrow pathway leading to the opening that was the lumberjack village. He saw, in the middle of it all, an axe-wielding madman - Ben Cruthdar - as he cleaved through a wounded, pleading logger with unnatural strength.\n\nBob was feeling uncomfortable. Not just because of the grisly scene. Not just because of the ferocious maniac. Not just because of the strange gloom that seemed to take up all of the circular opening that was the village. Something that he just couldn't - nor wanted to - put his finger on.\n\nHe shook the thoughts away. Time to put a stop to this. Bob dashed forwards, spinning and hitting him - and someone else?? with a powerful backhand. Dodging a clumsy but powerful blow, he jabbed the crazed labourer twice in the stomach, followed up with a punch so powerful that it created a concussive blast, knocking the cursed lumberjack to the floor, mortally wounded.\n\nThrough his death, his curse was lifted. Finally free, Ben said with his final breath: \"Thank you.\"\n\nThere was a deafening silence. Bob looked around. The loggers all around were stunned and staring at the scene. Bob looked to his side and found a logger, dead not by axe wounds but by his hands. The spinning backhand had hit him, and the force of the blast had finished him off. The leader of the bunch stepped forward, gave the pugilist a bag of gold and a well crafted pickaxe, and told him to leave and never come back.\n\nBob walked back the way he came, but he didn't get far because the lumberjacks, all scared, angry, and stunned, would not get out of the way.\n\nConfused and impatient, Bob waited for them to move out of the way. The lumberjacks did not get the message. They were terrified. They stood perfectly still. They waited for him to just use his Rod of Recall and go away.\n\nBut Bob had forgotten about his Rod of Recall, and was extremely confused as to why they would not just get out of the way. He was getting angry. The crowd, the wide opening, and not being able to escape were beginning to bring back repressed memories of the slave rings. \n\nHe needed to get out. He pushed. He shoved. He charged, jabbed, punched, and kicked. When he was finally out, he took a breath, recollected himself, and realized what he had just done. He looked back. A path full of lumberjacks was reduced to a terrified, shaking, and screaming handful. Bodies were strewn all over the floor. This looked like the aftermath of a visiting evil mage, but this time, their blood was on his hands. \n\nBob was mortified. He tried to reason with himself. He tried to deny that it was his fault. It was all just one big mistake. But no matter what he did, he knew it was his fault for forgetting about the voratun shaft that lay on his belt. \n\nHe ran from the village. He ran like the way he had been running his whole life. He ran from the past, his dark past, as just a slave of fate and bad luck. \n\nBut no matter what he did, he would always find himself back in the rings of blood, fighting wave after wave of monster and man alike, like some kind of pawn, some kind of gladiator fighting for the gods' amusement.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4762sh/everyone_is_john_how_my_first_game_went_featuring/",
        "text": "After a quick game of D&amp;D 5e, I convinced my group to try out [Everyone is John](http://www.everyoneisjohn.com/the-original-rules/). We were using a few common house rules, such as everyone picks a goal of each level and a phobia, and a modified version of the bidding system to speed up gameplay. We also awarded bonus points at the end for craziest skills, goals, and most problematic phobia, and added a condition that purposefully getting John killed results in an auto loss. I didn't look up the rules beforehand, so I winged it for the most part.\n\nPlayer 1 is Albert. He picked pretty generic things since it was the first game.\n\n- Skill 1: Persuasion\n- Skill 2: Deception\n- Skill 3: Driving\n- Goal 1: Get a Driver's License (This was approved by me, but later deemed too difficult for a level 1 goal)\n- Goal 2: Get Married\n- Goal 3: **Become the CEO of a fortune 500 company**\n- Phobia: Spiders\n\nPlayer 2 is Blake, he got in the spirit of the game and picked wacky skills and goals.\n\n- Skill 1: Riding a unicycle\n- Skill 2: Always get 19 when playing blackjack\n- Skill 3: Ability to instinctively know where Donald Trump is\n- Goal 1: Win money from online gambling\n- Goal 2: Make it across a tight rope while riding a unicycle\n- Goal 3: **Kill Donald Trump**\n- Phobia: Dice\n\nPlayer 3 is Charlie. He picked out very related goals and skills that made racking up points easiest for him.\n\n- Skill 1: Has every person's phone number memorized\n- Skill 2: Has the ability to find a phone anywhere\n- Skill 3: Can convince anyone on a date\n- Goal 1: Call the President's daughter\n- Goal 2: Date the President's daughter\n- Goal 3: **Marry the President's daughter**\n- Phobia: The President\n\nI was the GM, and I decided to start the party in the only logical place. Laying in a gutter in the middle of New York City, wearing nothing but underwear. Oh, and the year is 2017 and Donald Trump is president.\n\nFor the bidding system, we decided to go clockwise, starting with the person whose turn it \"should\" be (if no one bids at all, it will go to them), and did a public bid. Passing meant you are out of the bid for that turn.\n\nFirst up is Blake. He attempts to find a Starbucks and rolls a 6 (who needs to ask directions when you've got luck?), and then attempts to steal a laptop but couldn't manage to get it in time (bad rolls).\n\nNext up is Charlie. He's not sure what's going on, but he's in Starbucks and people are calling the police. He tells john to run from the police while looking for a phone. After being unable to find a phone after two failed rolls, John blacks out and it's the next voice's turn.\n\nOn Albert's turn, after a hefty bid of 3 of his total 6 will power (I thought we started with 6, turns out it should have been 7 or 10). He gets arrested by the police after being unable to deceive them. End turn (that bid really hurt his early game).\n\nThe next voice, Charlie, wakes up after some time (allowing each voice to receive 1 will token) in jail. He asks for his phone call, and immediately calls Trump's daughter (after a quick google, we chose Tiffany Trump for no particular reason). Charlie tries to persuade Ms. Trump to bail him out of jail, but fails.\n\nAlbert takes control of John while in the middle of a conversation with a very confused Ms. Trump. Using his Deception skills, he convinces her that he was trying to save a helpless old lady and that he is being unjustly imprisoned. Ms. Trump finds this stranger to be mysterious and wants to meet him.\n\nAfter some time, the secret service escort John to a limousine, then an airport, then to the White House to meet Trump's daughter. Along the way, The schizophrenic John failed to find a laptop, phone, or persuade the secret service to use their phone after several failed rolls.\n\nWhen arriving at the white house, the real bidding wars began.\n\nBlake makes the first move and immediately asks Trump's daughter on a date. She accepts, even though he is wearing nothing but some lender clothes from the prison, which are covered in blood and vomit steins, because he is devilishly handsome (and he rolled a 6).\n\nThe turn passes to Albert, who, not knowing Charlie's ultimate goal, asks Ms. trump to Marry her. She accepts, saying that they will be wed after their date later tonight.\n\nNext up was Blake, who was able to determine Trump's exact coordinates (Pooping in the executive bathroom of the White House) and tries to persuade himself past the secret service. After Spending his remaining dice to add +2 to a rolled 4, he is able to get in the 5-star luxurious bathroom with President Trump waiting helplessly behind a bathroom stall. His attempt to locate something heavy failed, so he starts to wrap a fancy towel into some sort of weapon, but loses control mid process.\n\nAlbert finds himself standing in the middle of an unknown bathroom, holding a towel with presidential seals, with foul smells and grunting noises coming from a stall. He waits for the man to finish, and upon realizing it is President Trump himself, asks for a small loan of $1,000,000 in order to start his own business. Trump agrees, and when a secret service agent later questions his sanity, Trump replies \"That's my future son in law! You're fired!\"\n\nAfter a quick look at everyone's goals and phobias, I remember I had forgotten to bring any phobias into play besides the president himself. I also casually mention that the circus is in town today.\n\nJohn decides to get cleaned and dressed up before his big day, and heads out to a bank with the $1,000,000 check signed by trump. The bank teller had to verify the check was legitimate, and after getting a call from Trump himself, the teller ignored the usual requirement to set up a bank account before cashing such a check. Albert spent a few too many Willpower tokens trying to get to the bank and so he lost control upon arriving at the bank with no easy way of getting it back, for now.\n\nBlake seized the opportunity and got all $1,000,000 dollars on a literal platinum card with a PIN only his voice would know. He also got $100 in cash from the ATM before heading to the circus that was conveniently located right next to the bank.\n\nThe date location was finalized to be at the circus. After a few lucky rolls, and a bribe, John was able to perform a tight rope unicycle act for his date before marrying his new wife. \n\nWe decided to end the game there, since Charlie was so far ahead in points by this time (especially after calling Ms. Trump a few extra times just for easy points), and he has completed his ultimate goal, and because I wasn't sure how to know when to end this game anyway.\n\ntl;dr: John's life worked out for the better this day. In the course of a few hours, John went from a crazy, naked, homeless man laying in a gutter and trying to steal laptops from people at Starbucks, to getting a $1,000,000 business loan from President Trump and marrying his daughter in a circus.",

        "text": "In this game I was playing a Rogue named Moonsugar, a ~~Khajit~~ Catfolk who was a professional, although amateur, assassin. Throughout the campaign he had shown a certain amount of respect for many types of views, from religious to arcane to social, and also a tendency to do things on his own. \n\nTowards the middle of the campaign, the party ended up shipwrecked on a tropical island in the middle of the sea, complete with dormant volcano, indigenous Orc population, and many useful resources. Over the course of several sessions, the party ended up brutally murdering the entire Orc population, befriending a trio of local pseudodragons, and adopting a clutch of Giant Falcon eggs. We then began to transform the island into a sovereign nation, because that's what I do in games I play in.\n\nOne of the aspects of the island that had been somewhat overlooked was a smaller island off the north, which had the only piece of semi-modern architecture in the area, that being a tall tower. We learned that there was an Adult Blue Dragon currently sleeping in the tower, and being rather low-level characters, we decided to avoid it. \n\nSoon after starting our island nation, we had a time-skip in the campaign, of about one year. During this time each player went out with the DM and explained what they were doing during this year, with some players campaigning to increase the population of the island, others researching new information on the BBEG, and some making guns. \n\nMoonsugar was officially serving as an ambassador, going to different countries to gather the displaced and downtrodden as members of the new nation, but he had an ulterior motive he didn't tell the rest of the party. Being a knife-based Rogue, he commissioned a Dragon Bane Dagger and a Scroll of Animate Dead, the scroll specifically made by a Juju Oracle (which, until an errata was released, allowed the Juju Oracles to cast Evil spells without the [Evil] descriptor, thus allowing them to raise Neutral undead; this was a major part of one of the other player characters, and thus was well-known to Moonsugar). \n\nFurthermore, Moonsugar had obtained a job through his contacts earlier in the campaign that had netted him a rather powerful, unique magic ring that would slowly transform him into a shadow creature over the course of 4 weeks while wearing the ring, while reducing the effects by a likewise amount of time that he left it off (so, if he wore it for two weeks and took it off for one, he would total having worn it for one week), and it gave him different powers based on how many weeks he had worn it. The problem was, he got murderous urges if he wore it for four weeks or more, so he usually timed it to only give him the three-week abilities. One of these abilities was the capability of shadow-jumping a small number of times per day.\n\nAnd so, Moonsugar hatched his plan. After returning to the island nation with his refugees, Moonsugar snuck away from the group and stealthed his way into the Dragon's Tower. Evading notice, he got as close as he could, and then shadow-jumped right next to the sleeping dragon, performing a coup de grace with two daggers, one a Dragon Bane Dagger, directly into the massive creature's neck. While the damage was not enough to kill the dragon outright, he still needed to succeed on a DC 65+ Constitution save to avoid immediately dying from massive damage, which he failed. \n\nMoonsugar quickly used the scroll to animate the dead corpse as a Skeleton, under his control, but Neutral in alignment. He then sat in the Tower until the rest of the party showed up, battle-ready to murder the Dragon, only to find Moonsugar chilling with its animated remains. The party was displeased at being kept out of the loop, but impressed with the results.\n\nMoonsugar later commissioned a \"skin\" made of mithral to be made to attach to the Dragon Skeleton, turning it into a flying tank, which the Alchemist used as a mobile platform to drop bombs out of in the final battle.
