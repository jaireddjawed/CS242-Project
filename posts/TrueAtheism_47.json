        "text": "A close friend of mine and I have dodged the religion conversation for 8 years. Just recently he noticed I was an Atheist and wanted to talk about why I didn't believe. After some agreements on cosmos, big bang theory, I was open to whatever he wanted to discuss. \n\nHe comes out of left-field with string theory, quantum mechanics, and then claims all these sciences confirm his belief in god. And, better, could all be proved using these sciences, except he doesn't accept the bible. \n\nAt this point I just stared at him blankly as he rambled on about it, and showed me some YT videos with some of my favorite Atheist Scientists, then explained that Carl Sagan converted at the end of his life because of string theory confirming the existence of heaven.. le sigh\n\nI just told him I needed to read up on this information before getting in a religious conversation with him. I googled enough to figure out he's a **Christian String Theorist**\n\nI googled a little bit online, but was wondering if anyone could explain it better here. \n\n**edit 1** After a little more back and forth, I found that he was mostly interested in M-Theory by Edward Witten. When he refers to \"string theory\" he's actually referring to \"superstring theory\" and \"supersymmetry.\" **Supersymmetry** [most recent article covering it](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/supersymmetry-fails-test-forcing-physics-seek-new-idea/) failed. After a little poking around on the net, I found this theory ties into a pseudoscience conspiracy theory, where a sect of Christianity tie to a specific belief that god lives in a different dimension in time and space, thus never being limited to our time-space continuum, therefore giving 'god' supernatural ability of time-travel throughout the dimensions, capable of being with every one person individually.

        "text": "Okay, so points to the rich ophthalmologist for feeding me a good steak and offering pleasant conversation in his huge estate before launching into his sermon.  He asked me to recount for him how I went from believing to not believing and I did my best to sum that up in a short spiel. He hit all the right notes of friendliness and receptivity and listened patiently to me telling my story for a long time.\n\nBut then he pulls out his laptop and starts preaching his way through a powerpoint about how the book of Job predicted galaxies and the water cycle and dark matter, and how the creation story describes the Big Bang.  He suggested that science is only \"just now catching up with the Bible.\"  Facepalm.  He also read me 2 Tim. 3:16 which says that God's word (presumably the Bible) is \"profitable for reproof,\" which he incorrectly interpreted to mean \"testing and retesting.\"  That's not what reproof means, and I can't believe this man is telling me this and he cuts into people's eyeballs for a living, getting paid more than ten times what I make in a year. But I digress.\n\nI cut him off, honestly, which I'm not accustomed to doing with white-haired men nearly twice my age.  But time was limited and life is short so I figured neither one of us is benefitting from this steady stream of bullshit.  To sum up, I told him the following:\n\n1) You can't quote the Bible to tell me that the Bible is reliable.  That's circular and invalid.\n\n2) I've tried \"testing\" the words of the Bible and they've failed miserably.  He contested that with a personal anecdote, so I asked him if he would prescribe a new drug to his patients solely on anecdotal evidence and he said \"Of course not; I would need double-blind, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed trials before I would do that.\"  Exactly.\n\n3) The book of Job presciently tells of dark matter and galaxies the same way my horoscope tells me what happened today.  It speaks in poetic terms, using vague generalities which the susceptible believer then plies into a shape that fits what actually happened.  It's called reverse engineering, and we do it instinctively to make our experience fit our beliefs.  This is just that tendency superimposed onto the field of science.\n\nThose ancient primitives had no concept of what you're talking about.  They thought the earth was a foundational bottom of everything and that the sun and stars move around us instead of vice versa.  I can't *believe* you would see that and then anachronistically read modern scientific awareness into their poetry.  I looked him in the face and told him in as respectful a tone as I could muster: \"You're pulling that right out of your ass.\"  I think I said \"rear end\" because he is a Baptist and you gotta draw the line somewhere.\n\n4) I had to inform him that there aren't any legitimate scientists who deny common ancestry as he does and I'm just baffled at the inconsistency of arguing that we should read modern understandings of dark matter and galaxies into a verse or two in Job and read the Big Bang into the creation story but then when science tells us we evolved from other species we have to say, \"No way.  That's not how the wording of the scriptures puts it at all!\"  Why is it okay to read modern cosmology into the text but not modern biology?  That's totally inconsistent and silly.\n\nWe both remained polite throughout the conversation and I imagine he will send along more \"challenges\" and \"things for me to think about\" as time goes on.  But I'm not gonna sit and be lectured to about how the Bible says stuff that there's no way in hell it really says.  Don't insult me like that.  Don't insult yourself.  I've studied the Bible much more seriously than this guy has ever done.  I sent him a link to the Biologos site so he could hear what it sounds like to have Christians accepting basic principles of biology and I sent him a link to my blog.  We'll see what he wants to do with that.  I'd love to be a fly on the wall of his conversation with my sister, though.\n",

        "text": "I'm definitely an atheist now and I may have been an atheist for a lot longer than I thought but just never realized. Sorry if the title doesn't make too much sense but I'll try to explain. \n\n\nI grew up Orthodox Jewish in a city where the only religious jews were Hassidic before moving to a city in middle school where all the religious jews were modern Orthodox. I never had a non jewish or even non orthodox friend until college. \n\nAnyway even as a little kid I don't remember believing in HaShem. My parents never were hassidic, even if we lived with them, so it was a weird mix of being in a hassidic school with hassidic friends and acquaintances while my parents were closer to modern orthodox and my non-immediate relatives were not religious (my mom's side are all atheist; she converted to judaism in college). \n\n\nAnyway I don't remember thinking much about the religion when I was young. oh sure, I did what people told me I should do and I was in a religious elementary school with only 20-25 people in the whole place. I learned biblical hebrew starting in first grade, although I'm still not very good at it, and learned the tanakh (not just the 5 books, but the book of the prohets, the purim story) line by line in the original hebrew and the major rabbinical commentary from first grade as well. Since I was a girl I never learned talmud of course. And neither did I have to learn the Aramaic language.\n\n\nI remember the tanakh/torah study to be interesting sometimes but in an intellectual way. Even as girls, we studied it line by line over and over again in different grade levels (in addition to our \"secular\" science, math, reading/writing English, social studies etc.) and the teacher would find meanings from a vowel difference in a word from one verse from that same verse three books later. Some of the ideas were really wacky but interesting as well. \n\n*none of the letters are vowels in hebrew. Instead the vowels are arrangements of dots and dashes below or above the letters. \n\nAlso I did think some parts of the religion were fun: the food, some of the holiday customs like dressing up on purim.\n\n\nHowever, I can't remember ever doing anything because of HaShem. It seemed to be people were there, or like the holidays because it was fun, or I'd have no friends at all if I didn't. \n\nBut for example we are supposed to pray to god everyday. Girls are supposed to do it once a day so we did every morning before class. It took at least 30 minutes and it was all in Hebrew and it was the same words from the same book every day. I was praised as a kid for being such a good \"davener\" but even then I always felt like the biggest hypocrite because I was never actually saying the words. I was thinking about other crap nothing to do with god. But I wasn't going to tell anyone of course. \n\nHowever despite all this I never thought that I did not believe until I got to college. It could be that the thought of not believing just never occurred to me. I mean even though my mom's side were atheist they were in europe and they weren't jewish. And my dad's side were jewish but not religious but I had always figured his parents had a right because of the holocaust, or I never though much about them not believing either because they lived several states away so weren't around every day like the hassidim were. I definitely never said even to myself that maybe I just don't believe in god. \nSo Idk, maybe there's a middle between belief and non belief. Not agnosticism per se because there was never the whole \"maybe there's a god or maybe isn't\". It was more of a \"I believe in god because duh, obviously I believe in god\" but then I don't know if I really did. If this makes sense. \n\nThe reason I'm asking is that is it possible that the same thing could be true now, but in reverse? Like, i'm pretty sure I don't believe but maybe I just think I don't because I disagree with the religion and how its presented. \nAlthough even in my modern orthodox high school with slightly different beliefs I still couldn't find myself passionate or even all that excited about the religion (besides the shallowly fun parts). \n\nI mean I always thought not giving your kids teddy bears because bears are non kosher animals was weird, and not owning a dog as a pet for the same reason was silly--although when you have 9+ kids you don't get dogs I guess, but they told the few families who only had a couple kids that they shouldn't get dogs for this reason. \n\n\nI guess women gossiping about whether another woman had fertility issues because that woman only had 3 kids is weird. Or it does strike me as pretty weird that we learned in elementary school that black people are black because Noah's son Ham laughed at drunk naked Noah instead of getting a blanket so god cursed his and his descendants' skin to be as dark as his heart was and be slaves in the future (but then gave Ham the whole of africa since god is nice). OR learning that the dinosaur bones were really bones of the giant people before the flood but scientists pretend that the bones were from lizards to test our faith. Thank goodness, my parents, for some reason, never censored my reading. \n\nBut as I get farther from my religion and community I'm having doubts. I don't know if this is normal or what or it means I'm stupid. I mean judaism was my whole life growing up. besides my non immediate family I knew maybe two or three people who weren't jewish or religious and they were hired as teachers so they didn't talk about anything about any religion or lack of it or even about personal lives at all. So I mean Judaism is my \"normal\" even though I know in a global sense it isn't normal at all. \n\nCould it be that its the people I don't believe, but god I still or could believe in? Am I stupid for having doubts about leaving (and not replacing it with a different religion or god)? I'm pretty sure I don't believe. I have found no reason to believe, so can I safely assume I don't? And how do I deal with lingering doubts and reflexive fears of punishments (even though I don't believe in the spiritual punishments either)? \n\n",

It was one thing to come out as an unbeliever and quite another to share these thoughts.\n\nThanks for reading/sharing.\n\nEdit: For those who don't care to invest in reading the entire article, here are my concluding thoughts:\n\nI’ve learned quite a bit over the past few years, and I’m much happier for it. I didn’t choose to “lose my faith” to free myself from religion (or choose to lose it at all), but freedom has turned out to be a most agreeable perk. The freedom – not merely from petty obligation but to do good for its own sake, under no threat of punishment - is the easy part. Managing or failing to manage relationships has been a persistent challenge. Like any social challenge, blame is a poor ingredient for success, as is dwelling excessively on past offenses. After all, honest religious people are victims of bad ideas as well as perpetrators, and those who would call them hypocrites for falling short of perfection have it exactly backwards. The fact is that there is no God to fill them with his love or guide their steps, speak through them or offer them insight, so their reliance on his assistance is, apart from any incidental confidence it confers, mostly a handicap. They deserve genuine, non-patronizing empathy for this. I’ve been in their position, after all, and was not saved by any exceptional quality I possess. I was saved by some additional information and a vague willingness to attend to the available evidence in spite of my beliefs. It could be that genuine empathy is a sensible starting point to arouse such a willingness in others.",

I've already told him that it's a bad idea, and that he will eventually hate her for it, or will decide not to hide it anymore and then he'll be neck deep in marriage/kids when they have the next ultimatum war. \n\nIt's causing him noticeable stress and depression, and she even had him move out while he takes the time to consider the ultimatum. I think this is on par with emotional abuse, and I don't know how to get through to him. He recognizes that it borders on spousal abuse and he keeps saying, \"I almost feel like I'm in a domestic abuse situation.\" She has been having her Catholic friends gang up on him (3 or 4 at a time) to try and convince him and sometimes bully him into becoming Christian. I've seen one of these events and it's usually HORRID rhetoric that is essentially repeated and shouted louder, and riddled with ad hominems like \"you think you're so smart and smarter than the rest of the world who believes in God?\" She wants him to go to her church and have counseling sessions with her priest (which he has already done for her in the past). \n\nIt just seems like he is doing everything he can to show her that he has analyzed the facts and doesn't buy into religion, and she is doing nothing to compromise and will accept nothing but a Christian boyfriend.

        "text": "I've been a Christian and creationist for virtually the entirety of my life. But lately I've been questioning things. If I'm completely honest with myself, I'm functioning right now more as an agnostic, but I don't know if that's completely true, either. I still pray. I still believe in Jesus. But I've been questioning a lot of things in my faith (i.e. \"why would a loving God create mankind if the great majority of them were just going to be condemned by his rules?\"), and I've been wondering more and more about things that I've just accepted over the years, one of them being the whole \"evolution is bunk\" thing.\n\nI've always accepted natural selection and adaptation, but not to the point that single-celled organisms eventually became mammals and that process eventually led to *Homo sapiens*. I've accepted it more along the lines of \"tigers, lions, cheetahs, and house cats likely all have the same feline ancestor, and that feline ancestor was an original creation of God.\" If that makes sense.\n\nSo I was wondering if someone might be able to answer some questions for me, all which I'm genuinely curious about. I've always heard and read (from my church, Ken Ham, creationist literature and websites, etc.) that even if evolution were true, however many millions of year it took simply isn't enough time for random mutations to lead to the species we have today from single-celled organisms. In fact, I remember one time a guy came to my church and laid out the mathematics of it all and how it was impossible. It seemed solid to me, but I don't know.\n\nThe other thing I've always heard is that mutations are pretty much (almost) always a bad thing, and lead to a loss of information, rather than a gain, and that, in fact, information doesn't just randomly get added to genes, rather it's just transcribed incorrectly. In other words, mutations degrade the genome of a species, instead of helping it. Is this not true? How would this lead to large-scale evolution:?\n\nThe final thing I've heard is that it's impossible for information to arise from nothing, and our genetic code is information. Going further, I've heard/read the argument that our genetic code is basically akin to language, and language naturally requires a two-way apparatus — one who speaks and one who understands — and this can't arise randomly, either.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n1. How are millions (billions?) of years a long enough period of time for completely random mutations to lead to the species we have today, namely human beings?\n\n2. From my understanding, almost all genetic mutations are either neutral or harmful, and can often lead to a loss of information in the genome, rather than adding beneficial information. How would this lead to large-scale evolution?\n\n3. I've heard/read that information can't arise from nothing. Our genetic code is essentially information. How did it arise randomly? In the same vein, it could be argued that our genetic code is language, but language requires a two-way sender/receiver apparatus to function. How could this happen randomly?\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone who took the time to respond. I really appreciate it. I had an unusually busy weekend, so I'm just getting to everything now.",

        "text": "What utter garbage. I didn't read a number of parts since he was presenting arguments I was very familiar with (some from his debates). As far as I saw the book had two major parts\n\n**Chapters 1-3: The disestablishment of reason**\n\nAn odd summary for a book called Reasonable Faith, but it is all I can think to summarize it. He explains that our reasons for believing are not intellectual but based on the revelation on the Holy Spirit. He goes on to explain that even if the evidence conflicts with what has been shown to us by the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit takes priority. Evidence is useful to bring people to a point where they are ready to listen to the Holy Spirit. He then takes a position I wouldn't expect someone of his education to take: there are no atheists. Yup, he claims that no one is an atheist on intellectual grounds but only becuase they refuse to accept the Holy Spirit because they like to sin or some other selfish reason. \n\nAfter this he moves on to the appeals to emotions. I don't see any purpose for this except to remind Christians that they *really* need to accept the following chapters. According to Craig life can not have meaning without God, his one specifically. He explains that the only end to atheism is suicide and those who have not done so have not followed atheism to its end. \n\n**Everything Else: The shotgun method**\n\nThe rest of the book was basically a collection of every reasonably intelligent argument for God and the truth of Christianity I've heard (that is, he doesn't include the brainless ones that people like Comfort and Hovind write). Craig has always made his stance on evolution very ambiguous (and amazingly he has won the favor of both sides here) so he doesn't really touch on the matter. This is about the closest he comes is a god of the gaps argument regarding the origin of life and the unfounded claim that evolution can not create beings as moral as humans. \n\nMuch of the science he presents consists of him using his lay understanding to establish a foundation and making amazing extrapolations from it. If there's anything I have learned from the advanced physics courses I've taken it is that you can not use lay intuition to extrapolate anything accurately. Its absurd to do so with broad statements about quantum mechanics or big bang theories (subjects far beyond my knowledge). He has a tendency to cite a lot of real science material to appear credible but he does not use in-text citations so it is difficult to determine how closely he was using the legitimate sources. \n\nI also felt that many of the chapters were just massive amount of double talk around the argument \"god did it so magic.\" His defense of miracles is a good example of this, the following quote is sanwiched between about ten pages of irrelevant background\n\n&gt; Given a God who is\nomnipotent, who conserves the world in being, and who is capable of acting freely,\nChristian thinkers seem to be entirely justified in maintaining that miracles are\npossible. Indeed, only if atheism were proved to be true could one rationally deny\nthe epistemic possibility of miracles.\n\nWhen addressing criticisms he, like most apologists, pick and chose which ones to cover carefully. Throughout the book it misrepresented atheism and did not address the very common arguments against the ideas he posted. He has no excuse since virtually everything in there exited for many years before he compiled it. \n\nI'm not sure why but I expected a little more. Christians had hyped this book to me as the best case for Christianity but in reality its just a compilation of the arguments we have all heard before. Reading this really solidified my opinion of Craig as extremely intellectually dishonest. I could see this convincing someone who already believes and is having doubts, and perhaps someone who sort of believes it and needs a push in, and I have a feeling that is the objective. ",

        "text": "This is a crosspost from /r/athiesm, and I thought that it would be a good idea to get some advice from here as well. I am having a debate on Facebook with a cousin of mine over evolution, and also on the origin of life. Believe me this is not a typical wacky crazy argument back and forth, merely a nice friendly point/counterpoint sort of thing, not hostile at all. I feel that I've been doing a decent job of arguing my position, however his last few comments are quite overwhelming and I would appreciate any advice or help for responding, thank you all so much! The specific things he has said:\n\nThe evolutionist might react by saying that even though any one such mutating organism might not be successful, surely some around the world would be, especially in the 10 billion years (or 1018 seconds) of assumed earth history. Therefore, let us imagine that every one of the earth's 1014 square feet of surface harbors a billion (i.e., 109) mutating systems and that each mutation requires one-half second (actually it would take far more time than this). Each system can thus go through its 200 mutations in 100 seconds and then, if it is unsuccessful, start over for a new try. In 1018 seconds, there can, therefore, be 1018/102, or 1016, trials by each mutating system. Multiplying all these numbers together, there would be a total possible number of attempts to develop a 200-component system equal to 1014 (109) (1016), or 1039 attempts. Since the probability against the success of any one of them is 1060, it is obvious that the probability that just one of these 1039 attempts might be successful is only one out of 1060/1039, or 1021. All this means that the chance that any kind of a 200-component integrated functioning organism could be developed by mutation and natural selection just once, anywhere in the world, in all the assumed expanse of geologic time, is less than one chance out of a billion trillion. What possible conclusion, therefore, can we derive from such considerations as this except that evolution by mutation and natural selection is mathematically and logically indefensible!\n\nYour right, The synthesis of these ancestral cells on primordial earth would have been impossible, So impossible, More impossible then anything else we know in this world to be exact. Evolution goes against Almost every scientific law we observe today, entropy (Things decline over time) Spontaneous generation, Law of information systems, Law of specified COmplexity, Irreducible Complexity, Statistical mathematics (as stated above) Information theory, Genetic complexity especially!, Natural Selection as well as the stated fossil record. According to the most-widely accepted theory of evolution today, the sole mechanism for producing evolution is that of random mutation combined with natural selection. Mutations are random changes in genetic systems. Natural selection is considered by evolutionists to be a sort of sieve, which retains the \"good\" mutations and allows the others to pass away. Since random changes in ordered systems almost always will decrease the amount of order in those systems, nearly all mutations are harmful to the organisms which experience them. Nevertheless, the evolutionist insists that each complex organism in the world today has arisen by a long string of gradually accumulated good mutations preserved by natural selection. No one has ever actually observed a genuine mutation occurring in the natural environment which was beneficial (that is, adding useful genetic information to an existing genetic code), and therefore, retained by the selection process. For some reason, however, the idea has a certain persuasive quality about it and seems eminently reasonable to many people—until it is examined quantitatively, that is! For example, consider a very simple putative organism composed of only 200 integrated and functioning parts, and the problem of deriving that organism by this type of process. The system presumably must have started with only one part and then gradually built itself up over many generations into its 200-part organization. The developing organism, at each successive stage, must itself be integrated and functioning in its environment in order to survive until the next stage. Each successive stage, of course, becomes statistically less likely than the preceding one, since it is far easier for a complex system to break down than to build itself up. A four-component integrated system can more easily \"mutate\" (that is, somehow suddenly change) into a three-component system (or even a four-component non-functioning system) than into a five-component integrated system. If, at any step in the chain, the system mutates \"downward,\" then it is either destroyed altogether or else moves backward, in an evolutionary sense. Therefore, the successful production of a 200-component functioning organism requires, at least, 200 successive, successful such \"mutations,\" each of which is highly unlikely. Even evolutionists recognize that true mutations are very rare, and beneficial mutations are extremely rare—not more than one out of a thousand mutations are beneficial, at the very most. But let us give the evolutionist the benefit of every consideration. Assume that, at each mutational step, there is equally as much chance for it to be good as bad. Thus, the probability for the success of each mutation is assumed to be one out of two, or one-half. Elementary statistical theory shows that the probability of 200 successive mutations being successful is then (½)200, or one chance out of 1060. The number 1060, if written out, would be \"one\" followed by sixty \"zeros.\" In other words, the chance that a 200-component organism could be formed by mutation and natural selection is less than one chance out of a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion! Lest anyone think that a 200-part system is unreasonably complex, it should be noted that even a one-celled plant or animal may have millions of molecular \"parts.\"\n\nand when it says 1060 it means 10 to the power of 60, And there arent even 10 to the power of 60 atoms in our entire universe, and thats after you give them a 1:1 chance for a benficial mutuation, imagine how impossible if we change it to the real chance of a positive mutation 1:1060 that would be as impssobile as the amount of atoms in over trillions of trillions of billions of our universes, Perspective much?\"",

Big fab of this sub so I'm looking for some of your thoughts and opinions.\n\nA religious friend of mine and I have been debating everything imaginable for weeks now. He is a fanboy of William Lane Craig and thinks his arguments are air-tight. I can see the faulty logic in them but can't quite articulate a rebuttal. I haven't studied or thought much about morality and it probably will be evident in this post. Anyway, this is how the dialogue went the other day:\n\nQ: Do you believe there is truth when it comes to the correct way to live life?  \nA: No, I believe a \"correct\" fulfilled life is personal.\n\nQ: So you do or do you not believe that there is an objective standard (outside of human opinion) to which people should compare themselves to in regards to determining if they themselves or an act they performed is moral?\nA: Nothing outside of humanity, no.\n\nQ: In your opinion is there objective truth for the purpose of life that is transcultural and unchanging? \nA: No.\n\nQ: Is the belief that you hold (that there is no objective truth in regards to the purpose of life) true?\n\nThis is where I got backed into a corner. I haven't seen much about this topic in this sub so any help from either side of the fence would be appreciated.",

Essentially all it does is bash bad atheists and doesn't show the good side at all.  I decided to send this message to the page:\n\nHello. I'm a deconvert who had a friend share one of your pictures. As an Atheist, I wanted to say that I think you are misrepresenting us. While there are some who believe that all religious people cause wars, and hate science, most of us don't. Most of us were religious at one point before not seeing a reason to believe. Now the pain of feeling like you were brainwashed for many years can cause some bitter emotions, but I respect a lot of atheists respect a persons right to hold a religion.  \nSo why am I messaging you? I am NOT asking you to stop your content. What I am asking is that you make an accurate display of Atheism. We do not have dogma. We don't all hold the same opinions. There are plenty of atheists who are friendly and do great things for the world. I just ask that you show the good side of atheism every so often.  \nThank you very much for reading.\n\nThis was the response:\n\nThank you for contacting us and your sincere and thoughtful message. We do make a conscious effort to not group all atheists together. We try to describe the type of atheist we are talking about, whether it be militant, hateful, intolerant, etc. depending on the content of what was said. That being said, I do have to disagree with you on a few points. I don't think either of us can speak for what 'most' atheists believe. All we have to go on is what we see from atheists in the public, and those atheists that are public with their atheism tend to be much more confrontational and verbally abusive towards believers in God. Another reference point is book sales. The biggest selling atheists books are those that promote divisiveness and intolerance, while those atheists promoting coexistence have much weaker book sales. The market place is a good way of determining what a group thinks. Still, if you have stories about good atheists that you would like us to share, feel free to send them and we'll take a look.  \nAll the best. FFAF Admin.\n\nI was wondering if you guys could help me out.  Even if you just list some good organizations by atheists, that would help.",

        "text": "http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2014/07/atheists_the_origin_of_the_species_by_nick_spencer_reviewed.html\n\n&gt;Nevertheless, Richard Dawkins claims that religion “is a scientific theory,” “a competing explanation for facts about the universe and life.” This is—if you’ll forgive my theological jargon—bullshit.\n\nWhen most religions make claims about the way the universe came to be and all that jazz, I don't see how he says this is bullshit.  The Bible starts with creation stories.  I know Catholics take these now as 'allegorical' but not all mainstream Christians do.  Why make these claims in the first place if they are wrong?  It doesn't lend any credence to your religion.\n\n&gt;Science and religion ask different questions about different things. Where religion addresses ontology, science is concerned with ontic description. Indeed, it is what Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart calls their “austere abdication of metaphysical pretensions” that enables the sciences to do their work. So when, for instance, evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne and pop-cosmologist Lawrence Krauss dismiss the (metaphysical) problem of how something could emerge from nothing by pointing to the Big Bang or quantum fluctuation, it is difficult to be kind: Quantum fluctuations, the uncertainty principle, the laws of quantum physics themselves—these are something. Nothing is not quantum anything. It is nothing. Nonbeing. This, not empty space, is what “nothing” signifies for Plato and Aquinas and Heidegger, no matter what Krauss believes. No particles, no fluctuation, no laws, no principles, no potentialities, no states, no space, no time. No thing at all.\n\nBasic rewording of argument from nothing, therefore there must be *something*, and this something is god.  Obviously ignores the fact that there must be an infinitely complex being because something can't come from nothing gives rise to the question of where the infinitely complex being came from.  Occam's Razor certainly applies here.\n\n&gt;Several critics have noted that if evangelical atheists (as the philosopher John Gray calls them) are ignorant of religion, as they usually are, then they aren’t truly atheists. “The knowledge of contraries is one and the same,” as Aristotle said. If your idea of God is not one that most theistic traditions would recognize, you’re not talking about God (at most, the New Atheists’ arguments are relevant to the low-hanging god of fundamentalism and deism). But even more damning is that such atheists appear ignorant of atheism as well.\n\nI don't understand what I cannot understand about atheism?  It's simply the non-belief in a deity.  Nothing else.  This isn't a difficult concept.  Also, atheists know more about religion on average than their believing brethren: http://www.pewforum.org/2010/09/28/u-s-religious-knowledge-survey/\n\n&gt;Nietzsche realized that the Enlightenment project to reconstruct morality from rational principles simply retained the character of Christian ethics without providing the foundational authority of the latter. Dispensing with his fantasy of the Übermensch, we are left with his dark diagnosis. To paraphrase the Scottish philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, our moral vocabulary has lost the contexts from which its significance derived, and no amount of Dawkins-style hand-waving about altruistic genes will make the problem go away. (Indeed, the ridiculous belief that our genes determine everything about human behavior and culture is a symptom of this very problem.)\n\nI find it hard to argue that Christians are 'more ethical' than other groups in general.  They've been on the wrong side of history on lots of moral issues (gay marriage being the most obvious recent one).  Morality is subjective and I'd say I do not agree with most of Christian morality outside of loving your neighbor.\n\n&gt;If someone is really interested in whether or not God exists, I’d say the best way is to have a little humility and experiment, with an open mind and heart, with the paths that Christians have claimed take you directly to him, in the ways that have worked. If someone isn’t willing to do such a thing, and insists that a discussion about painting be one about mathematics, then the conversation isn’t going to go anywhere.\n\nShe is basically saying you need to try harder so you believe.  Listen, I really, really have.  I would much rather there be a god than there not be.  I want to live forever, I really do.  The evidence just doesn't point towards it.",

I do think that the cosmological argument is valid, and I define God as the almighty creator of the Universe. But I don't think that this God is relatable to as a person, or that he (it?) ever needs to think what to do - i. e. God never stumbles, and it is like some sort of ultimate force or principle that creates by necessity, sort of like when math theories are developed, the theorems proved are independent on our wish for them to be true or not.\n\nWhat do you guys think about the argument?

If Jesus was born from Mary, would this not be greater coming from lesser according to Christians?  Now one could argue that Mary was the blessed virgin and therefore is just making something equal (not greater).  But then we run into the same problem with Mary.

One doesn't even stop to consider the possibility that the condemned behavior is the result of human nature expressing itself in a given context, under the influence of chaos and randomness.\n\nFor example, why did you buy that expensive, but useless trinket?

I'm not sure what that might mean to some of you, but I at least hope that you know a real one. I spend most of my days gaming or talking politics and religion with my friends, all of whom are atheists. Strange right?\n\nToday something happened however that pretty much sucked.\n\nWe were doing our regular thing and talking religion when everyone went around the room and everyone commented on how much they hated religious hypocrites. After they saw how everyone agreed I think they remembered I was there and added that they equally hate any kind of hypocrite. \n\nI know they didn't aim it at me, but it still stings, you know? \n\nLots of people hound us religious nuts for any time we show hypocrisy, and I get it, I hate hypocrisy too.  But it left a question in my mind that I'm not sure I can fully articulate, but I'll try.\n\nWhen you consider religious hypocrisy what makes it so different from any other kind?\n\nThe conclusion I came to was that any religion has rules its followers to live by. If you grew up in a western society, then you know what basic Christian beliefs are. Its really clear when hypocrisy is present in us because its all written down. \n\nThe second thing I thought, is that maybe deep down it gives validation to anyone who doesn't believe? \n\nWell I wrote more than I expected to, but hopefully we can still talk. I'm not angry with my friends at all btw.  What do you all think?\n\nEdit: I don't want you all to believe that I think very little of you just for the validation thing I said.

        "text": "I am finding it difficult to believe that the gospels were written near the end of the first century. The main piece of evidence I've read that backs up this claim is that Jesus \"predicted\" the destruction of the Jewish temple, and since the temple was destroyed in 70 CE, the gospels must have been written after 70 CE. While it's certainly likely that the writers invented the story, my problem with this being the main source for the dating of the gospels is that it presupposes that Jesus wasn't the son of god/a prophet/whatever. Assuming the thing you're trying to prove is faulty logic.\n\nA larger red flag for me is that that if the gospels were written that late, the disciples/eye witnesses likely would  have long been dead. So why did the writers believe that Jesus would come back during (at least a few of) the disciples' lifetimes, which they depict Jesus stating several times in the gospels (http://www.evilbible.com/end_times.htm). From what I've read, most scholars believe Matthew to have been written between  80-90 CE, and the average life expectancy in Palestine during the first century was ~45 years. Assuming that the disciples were as young as 30 in 30 CE, they would have been at least 80 by the time Matthew was written. It's possible that at least one was still alive at the time but unlikely. However I have seen a lot of people, especially on reddit, dismiss the gospels by saying they were written at least a century after the events, in which case none of them would have been alive. The same people will say that Jesus was a failed prophet because he didn't return during the lifetime of the disciples, BUT the disciples would have been dead when that was written anyway. You can't have it both ways; it makes absolutely no sense that the writers of the gospels wrote that knowing full well that the prophecy had failed. \n\n\nSo anyway, I remain skeptical about the dating of the gospels and I feel like people who say that the gospels can't be trusted *simply because they were written 50-100 years after the fact* are exaggerating or are mistaken. If you honestly believe the gospels were written a *goddamn* century after Jesus' death, why do you think that? Why would the writers include a failed prophecy? There are so many other reasons to discount the gospels besides a later date, of which the evidence  really doesn't convince me. \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts? If there's something I'm missing, any other evidence for a later dating of the gospels, please let me know!\n",

Since I doubt there is anything like an afterlife, I feel this is all we have. And I try to treasure it as much as possible. I used to be afraid of death, but now I'm not. Not at all. I feel like there is an afterlife in a weird sciencey sense. When I die, the molecules that made me up will go back into the earth and allow the flaura and fauna to dine on me as I have dined on them. And then, at the end of our solar system, my molecules will be blasted into deep space. There, they may form another star, or be apart of a planet and become new life forms! And the cycle will continue for trillions of years, until the temperature of the universe winds down to 0 kelvin. All will stop. No more stars. No more planets. No more life. And in a sense, I will be there. At the end of the universe. It's poetic, in a weird way.\nIf I died tonight, sure I'd be sad. Sad for missed opportunities. Sad for missed possibilities. Sad for my friends and family. But, I'd be content with my time in the sun. This short time we get to spend alive. I'd be content knowing that I was apart of the universe that knew itself. A part of the universe that had woken up.\n\nI just wanted to share that with all of you.",

        "text": "So I've been agnostic atheist for a long while now. Most of my life, if you count the fact that I actively practiced \"doublethink\" or \"layered thought\". I would hold my personal beliefs/perspectives that shaped the world at my core [mainly cosmology, geology, science in general] and then allow a surface layer of thoughts to mimic real belief. My family is Catholic and heavily so, but they've lived a hard life, so I recognize that their religion gives them comfort and have never tried to persuade them otherwise. But recent years have been particularly difficult, so I've been less patient about pretending to have faith for the sake of their comfort. While I have never evinced my true beliefs, I have refused to pretend to believe that my prayers [over so many others in the world, some perhaps directly contradictory] would be answered by some magical being. I go to church to keep the peace while I'm interning and living at home, but I don't bother going through the motions of all the ceremonial things. I stand there respectfully. Maybe it makes it more obvious to them that things are different for me, but I honestly don't have the energy to pretend anymore. [I'm on my second round of unpaid internships]. But I understand that it gives them comfort and I never try to convince them otherwise. \n\nMy parents on the other hand, have become more forceful in basically shoving religion down my throat. They force me to pray with them as often as possible. Whenever I bring a concern to them, they tell me to pray harder [actually this isn't new, but it grates more as the years go by, especially when I really just want some advice from my parents rather than being told to pray harder]. The more they push, the more I've shifted from agnostic to atheist [though I still define myself as agnostic in some ways, because its the most scientifically defensible position]. \n\nWhich brings me to today. I went to church with them, day dreamed/ planned my work schedule, when I got pulled into a discussion with the priest and my parents. Which led to my parents telling him that I was \"losing faith\", \"needed holy guidance\" etc. Anyway, I now have an appointment with him on Monday to talk over things. I'm not sure what to expect. From our responses to each other, I'm guessing he probably suspects what my actual views are. But he believes that god has made things difficult so that I may be shown the \"true path\" and that they \"caught me just in time\". Little do they know that I've been pretending for most of my life and view myself as a secular humanist scientist first and foremost. But, I am a bit nervous about this upcoming discussion. \n\nI was hoping that you guys could give me some advice? I've been lurking here for ages, and I've loved reading the discussion between TrueAtheism's subscribers on many occasions. Could I bother you for some advice now? What sort of discussions should I bring up? What is he likely to bring up? What should I be wary of? Should I be completely honest with him? Has anyone else here dealt with a similar scenario? \n\nThanks in advance! I'm sorry if I'm slow to respond. Even if I can see some people discussing between themselves, it would be helpful, so please, if everyone could chime in, I would be most grateful. \n\ntl;dr: family making me talk to priest to get my faith back. I haven't had any in years. \n\nAlso - I've studied a lot of the major religions since I was a child, since I could never stop asking why. I went through a phase where I picked out what I liked best from all the different religions. Then I tried attending different services. Finally stuck with my initial inclination that the universe was magnificent without human ornamentation [religious interpretation]. \n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone that responded. I've read all your comments, and some of them were particularly helpful. I'll have to play it by ear when I actually speak with him, but I'm relieved to have received such support here and to know that others have gone through the same thing before. And to know that this community is available [with many people a lot wiser than I] and that I have an outlet, is heartening. If I had the means to gild you all, I would! But all I can say is, Thank You. ",

He has no siblings yet and both his mom and I work quite a bit, so it's an extra chance for him to get out of the house and interact with other kids his age while developing basic social and physical skills. I figure he's not old enough for the indoctrination to really take hold yet, it makes the grandparents extremely happy, and we're going to be gone in a year or two anyway when we move for my career. And he likes the music and extra attention and so forth.\n\nBut in any case, I wouldn't mind a little variety. I've thought about taking him to temples and such of other religions sometimes to switch things up, but aside from finding friends with kids and setting up play dates or dropping him off at a day care, I'm not sure what else is out there. Any ideas? I've thought about Montessori, but we can't really afford it just yet.",

        "text": "Do any of you have experience debating members of the Church of Christ?\n\nIn case you didn’t know, the Church of Christ rejects most of the tenants of the Old Testament. They believe it to be factual and divinely inspired, but they believe that when God gave us Christ (or became Christ or however the fuck that one wants to reconcile that polytheistic turn alongside the Holy Ghost), there was a new covenant made with man; the old covenant with the Bnai Yisraʾel was forever after null and void.\n\nWhat this means is that the batshit craziness of the Old Testament rules -- which we all trot out to exemplify the lunacy of trying to appease the rules laid out by a bronze era “God” – becomes nothing but dead weight easily countered with “but that’s not what we believe”. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches_of_Christ\n\nYes – the broader concepts such as the divinity of Christ, the likelihood of a God in general, the morality of God, the likelihood of historicity of the Old Testament etc. are still at one’s disposal. But I’m looking primarily for the rules for living that are usually rejected in the modern world. These are not people to whom one can say “mixing of fibers is verboten according to your God”.\n\nSo what are your favorite bits of insanity and rules for morality from the New Testament? What would you point out to someone for whom the Bible has been cleaved from its nastier, more obviously insane progenitor?\n",

It prevents them from thinking too hard about the moral standards they have, and gives them a sense of camaraderie when dealing with pastors and preachers whom they believe to be really wise. \n\nThe state seems to follow the same sort of scheme. Law is considered a moral impetus by many because they believe that the laws of the land are only so because they are just and fair. If you present them with and unjust and unfair law, they will say that it is due to X identity group who is corrupting an otherwise beautiful system. They go to bed at night certain that the police will protect them from bad men (instead of knowing the obvious truth that the police *are* the bad men), and will occasionally pray to the state by writing their congressman or voting. \n\nFor the record, I believe that prayer is more effective than voting, and I'm an atheist.\n\nIt seems to me that if people took their heads out of their asses and smelled the world for what it actually is they'd realize that, like the church, the state is a band of thieves and brigands that prey upon the weaker sensibilities of the meek and turn it into profit for the select few. The catholics have a pope, we have a president. \n\nYou could say 50 hail mary's to get out of a sin, and be forgiven. The state will just take about 150 bucks from you and put a bad mark on your driving record. \n\nOne of the weird differences though is that while churches have a tendency to threaten you with eternal damnation in a lake of fire, they do not have means to actually harm you more often than not (in modern America, at least, they yielded much more power back in the day). If you don't pay your tithe to the church of the State, you'll first receive a few letters and some phone calls, you'll probably be asked to attend some sort of meeting where the assumption that you are obligated to pay them is the starting point and the \"I can do what I want\" is an alien language. Then they'll either take it directly from your employer, seize your assets from a bank, rob you of your home, and/or throw you in a cage. \n\nIt seems to me that the easiest step one can take is saying, \"Imaginary things aren't real\". This is how you rid yourself of religion. \n\nIsn't it sad that ridding yourself of a state is much more difficult. \n\n",

        "text": "**EDIT**  \n\n\nThanks so much for all the replies.  This got way more attention than I was ever expecting, so I apologize if I don't reply to every comment, but I have read them all and appreciate every opinion and especially anecdotes.  I'd like to just address a couple of things since a lot of the comments mention similar thoughts.  \n\n- The predominant opinion seems to be that this is purely a cultural issue and I agree. I've never experienced a significant overlap of family/religion/culture, so I didn't realize some people can't separate that stuff. The part that makes that difficult for me is that, while these may just be cultural customs for my SO, they are actually religiously meaningful to the rest of his family. I can't identify with that because the cultural customs I have with my own family are not religiously meaningful for any of us.\n- A number of people have likened fasting for Ramadan to celebrating Christmas.  While I do understand the point that's trying to be made, I just can't agree that 30 days of fasting is akin to a morning of gift exchange. The day of Eid at the end of Ramadan? For sure! But not the month of Ramadan.  Not to mention that the connection between Christmas and religion is literally zero for me, as my family is not Christian, Catholic or anything even close to that. I have never known Christmas in any way other than 100% secular with gifts and decorated trees and Santa, and we all know those things have nothing to do with the religious aspects of Christmas. If anything, Christmas is actually a jumble of a lot of different cultures.  \n- I don't ever force, insist, or even suggest that he must consume pork.  Unlike most people who were raised to not eat pork, he doesn't have any repulsion towards it at all.  He's willfully eaten it a bunch of times (before we even met in fact) and also accidentally and has always enjoyed it.  He stopped as he apparently felt bad breaking away from his family's values - hence the guilty feelings.  There are other foods he doesn't eat simply because he doesn't like them.  Obviously there is no issue with that all.  I just feel bad that he can't enjoy something he actually does like (pork) because his family has stigmatized it for him.  \n- A number of people seem to have confused my thoughts and feelings listed here for things I actually say or demand of him.  These are my internal thoughts and feelings and none of it is anything I push on him. They are simply things I internally don't understand. Do I think it's wrong or controlling to ask him why he does something or feels a certain way? Absolutely not. A lot of it he's never really thought in depth about and having someone actually ask why can allow him to really consider why.  I don't tell him how to think or feel or that he's wrong for thinking or feeling differently than me. I came here to get more perspective on the reasoning he's given me. I don't think that's wrong either.\n\n\n\n---\n\nHello! I've made a similar post on this topic in another subreddit, but would like to get opinions of those here.\n\nI am non-religious and my fiance is non-religious, however he was raised Muslim and still practices two religious customs: fasting during Ramadan and not eating pork.  He says he doesn't feel he is doing this for any god, but rather for himself as self discipline.  And also to please his family.\n\nMy issues are:  \n- I find religion creepy and having my S.O. involved in a religious practice like fasting for a month weirds me out and conflicts with the logic in my brain  \n- He has eaten pork and loves it, but won't eat it because he feels guilty, and I feel bad for him that he feels so guilty that he can't eat something he enjoys and has to miss out  He has no psychological repulsion to pork.  Supposedly self discipline... ?  \n- Even though he assures me that he does not believe in Islam, watching him partake religious practices makes me feel like he actually does.  I believe him, but it's difficult for me to separate the two, as in my mind it's a clash.  Not that he's not allowed to, but I would feel deceived since he has always told me he has no belief in the religion.  \n- I come from a very liberal family and have a hard time understanding why people would want to fake/hide/not stand up for their true beliefs in order to please their family. (Though I understand some families would truly flip their shit, this wouldn't be the case for my fiance)\n\nHas anyone here dealt with anything similar and might have some advice for how I can overcome these issues? They are small in the grand scheme of things for sure, but with it currently being Ramadan, it is going to be at the forefront of my mind for some time and peace of mind would be grand.  \n\n\n\n",

Addiction, Christian believing wife, and my own bent to choose immoral and dishonest means of obtaining things because of fear, the kind of fear which is based on people pleasing, yet I act in a way that would be much more shameful if caught then if I told the truth.

Therefore, if you have a mind that has greater activity and capabilities, that makes you a better person.  But as for someone who has greater intelligence than someone who has greater pleasure, the scientific fact is that pleasure is the greatest thing above any function in the brain because our personal experience of this emotion obviously says so (it is a natural conclusion that we make because without pleasure, then you would obviously be completely dead inside and no one would ever want that).

I have been trying to come up with some questions to help bring these thoughts out in as kind a way as possible.  \n\nAn example would be why religious people get so sad when anyone dies if they think they are going to Heaven.  Do they really think every person ever conceived that has died is just hanging around in hell or haven?",

        "text": "According to science, morals are false and irrational.  For example, the religious moral that homosexuality is a sin is something many atheists know is false according to science.  However, these same atheists are unaware that their own personal morals such as helping others, not harming or criticizing others, and not seeking self-glory and attention are also false according to science.  They are no different than morals from religion (the only difference being that religious morals are from primitive superstitious belief and that their own personal morals are from their own personal views of life).  But they are both similar in that they are from personal views in life and not from scientific facts.\n\nIf we were to look at everything from a scientific perspective and not from a moral point of view, then everything would all just be a natural scientific process that we won't frown upon (because this is the perspective that atheists already have towards things like homosexuality as they are already aware that homosexuality is something scientifically natural). \n\nAccording to science, the concept of something \"bad\" is when a pain signal or a signal that triggers a loss of pleasure reaches the brain (even emotions such as anger and sadness are recognized by the brain as something \"bad\").  Therefore, if someone were to have the attitude of harming others and decides to do it and takes pleasure in doing so, only the harm that these people are experiencing is something bad for them.  But as for this person's attitude and actions, they are not bad.  Only the pain and unpleasant emotions themselves that these people are experiencing are bad for them.  Actions are nothing more than a series of atomic activity (and this even goes for an attitude which is nothing more than a series of neuron activity and such in the brain).  Therefore, attitude and actions by themselves are not bad as they are not pain or unpleasant emotional experiences.  Even if you were to interpret these things as bad, the scientific fact is that they are not.  All it is is just a matter of one person experiencing personal pleasure (in this case, from harming others) while other people experience misery and nothing more.\n\nHaving feelings of anger and such towards someone who chooses and has the attitude of harming others and such may be an evolutionary response in getting problems solved (in this case, the problem being harm being done to others).  And that by having feelings of anger and such towards this person, that would be a way of trying to change this person so that they stop causing this problem.  But the scientific fact of the matter is that you do not have to be a part of evolution in this sense and what others think of you.  You are free to think, feel, and do whatever you want according to science.\n\nTherefore, based on my reasoning here, does this give anyone the right to do anything they want in life?  If not, you would have to scientifically explain why.  Otherwise, any moral explanation you come up with against my argument would be false and irrational according to science.",

I had no idea this was such a substantive effort.\n\nIs this the way that cases like these are being won?  Is there some sort of propaganda push to debate one-sidedly on issues like these?  Who is the audience for these such that any of it would make a difference in the actual court decisions?\n\nIs it just some effort to save face?  To whom?  People who are on the fence about boycotting their stores?\n\nI guess my real question is, why are they spending money on this stuff when everything depends on what Justice Roberts feels like saying Monday morning?",

        "text": "to preface this: 20 year old male living in Texas, only important because of all of the churches we have.\n\nSo I was raised in a Christian house hold, and while I was younger my parents never seemed to have cared or maybe just didnt have the time for Religion so we didnt talk much about it nor did we go to church very consecutively. Over the years though they have slowly become more religious, in part I think due to my grandfather becoming a Preacher for a small church of mostly old folks. \n\nI love my family dearly but I never really grabbed onto the idea of religion, and also through my own readings (mainly Albert Camus, I really identify with his work) I've come to the realization I personally do not believe in a supreme being. I've been hiding these thoughts, although not necessarily my reading material, to myself for about a year now. However, I'm tired of lying or trying to find excuses to exit conversations dealing with their beliefs and want to tell my family, but I'm extremely nervous. \n\nFirst of all I know it will kill my mom, her brother just died recently (freak heart attack, no heart disease runs in the family) and I had to console her for several hours because he was an outspoken atheist. Because of this I'm not planning on doing it too soon, give it maybe a few months to let that subside.. maybe more than that depending.\n\nSecond, my dad and I have had a very troubled relationship for the past few years due to some life choices not coinciding. He's also a bit of a hot head so I have to work around that as well. \n\nThird, my grandfather will be devastated. I have always looked up to him and have had great personal relationship, he is my central role model for how I want to go about life. He's always been extremely cool headed, although according to my father that was because of old age, so I think he might be the easiest to break it to, but right now he's devoting 70% of his time to his ailing wife (extreme dementia due to diabetes) so I dont know if that will add some unpredictability to it. I'm honestly terrified the look I will relieve from him if/after I let this out.\n\nAny advice on how I should go about this? Should I suck it up and keep it to myself for a few years and let all these life issues to settle down? \n\nI know if I tell my dad he's going to tell the rest of my family immediately to try to recruit them to argue with me about it, and it might ostracize me from certain members.\n\nThanks.",
