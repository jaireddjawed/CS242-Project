        "text": "I'll make this short, I'm not much of a story teller.\n\nEarlier this month I got drafted into a weekend shift the evening of being a Paulbearer for my fiance's mom at her funeral. Needless to say, I'm not gonna be the chipper person I usually am. \n\nAt work I was designated to the quality inspection zone at my warehouse (basically restacking packages and throwing away bad material) with a group of other people that were having fun, making jokes, taking their time etc. \n\nI was working on throwing glass away so we have to wear PPE like face shields and Kevlar. We keep them in a supply cabinet behind where the other group is at. I was putting my stuff away, walking past them, when management saw the group from afar and everyone got written up violations for 'socializing on company time'. Annoying but whatever I got more stuff to deal with.\n\nFast forward to the actual malicious compliance...\n\nMy job task this time was running a filling machine which involves loading a conveyor with fresh material. If it runs low a safety switch kicks on to stop the machines so products aren't wasted.\n\nA talkative manager like to get bored and just wander around having conversations with people working the lines for 5-10minutes at a time.\n\nIt's the same manager that wrote me up.\n\nShe comes up to me, standing right where i be to be to load up the machine to run and has the usual 'hi, how's it going? How is your day? Did you have fun this weekend? Are you doing anything fun this weekend? I'm doing blah blah blah. Are you working this weekend? Blah blah blah'\n\nI don't say a word. I just nod or shake my head (we work in an extremely loud +80db area so need earplugs and it's hard to tell over anything anyway. \n\nI just let the machine run dry and stare at her while she asks me why it stopped. I told her the machine was empty. She asked why I let it do that. I told her she was in the way socializing with me to the point I can't effectively complete my tasks and I don't want to get in trouble.\n\nShe just stared at me and told me to get back to work.\n\nI do this every time I see her, or any other management. \n\nEventually they got the idea that I don't have anything to say to them, which helps with a lot of micromanagement  \n\nTldr: got written up for socializing when I wasn't talking to anyone, now I don't talk to anyone.",

[Original Malicious Compliance](https://old.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/928z8o/that_group_must_have_a_ticket_a_page_an_email_and/)\n\n1st the follow up. After about 2 days of the ridiculous escalation instructions we were given they backed off the phone calls. Meaning now I only have to ticket, email, and page for issues.\n\nWell as a courtesy if we have more than 1 job failing with the same naming convention I will usually combined them into a single ticket, email, and page to save everyone time and heart ache (all our software is so slow I can watch grass grow).\n\nAbout an hour ago I finally got off the phone with the on-call of the group and this is what it just boiled down too. We had about 25 jobs all fail at the same time for the same reason with the same naming convention. Me being the nice guy I am I go against our protocol and put all these into 1 incident.\n\nWaited an hour and no response... they are required to contact us in some way within like 15-30 minutes. So I page again this time just saying, \"Please contact OPS\" and that's when the fight started. I was told he could not do anything about the failures as I did not provide job information instead just writing, \"25 XXXXX* jobs failed on Prod. Please investigate.\"\n\nThey have access to the system and are 100% able to go out and see this laundry list of problems. The argument came down to unless we provide separate tickets AND pages for each individual job they will not investigate.\n\nI have just finished writing 25 tickets (automatically generates an email), 25 emails, and 25 back to back pages which generates a email and phone call. Their manager (again who I despise) calls and asks why she is being bombarded like this as this is not how it is normally handled. Side note - they all have company issued phones so every email and page they get will notify them on their phones. Meaning with 1 job they got 4 notifications on their phone. I politely tell her that technically this is how it is supposed to be handled but we do not do that as a courtesy for everyone involved and continue to relay the lengthy and extremely angry phone call between myself and her on-call.\n\nShe quickly told me that she will speak with on-call and to please continue to do this in the courteous way.\n\nTL;DR - Spent about an hour causing 100 notifications and 25 phone calls to spam their entire groups company cell phones.",

        "text": "Sometimes you show up to a job, only to realize that it's already been shanked with Morton's Fork.  That becomes apparent on this job when I see there is no pump.  We are pouring footings, a job which, even for a single home, normally involves a [boom pump](http://www.putzmeistermedia.com/Images/4-13-11/70Z-at-Japan-Facility-4.jpg) (get your mind out of the gutter.  It's German, not Yiddish).  Since the contractor wants to save money, we are trying to pour the footings for multiple pads in a tract housing development.  It means driving a 35-foot long mixer-truck up onto the graded pads and trying to manuever around what will be the side yards between houses.  What should have been a job taking five-ten minutes per truck is taking a half hour or more.  The contractor's choices are:  \n  \n**A)**  Keep the trucks coming at the rate on the order, in which case they will stack up, the concrete will get old, and he will have to pay for the loads the inspector rejects.  \n**B)**  Put a hold on the order and call the trucks out as he needs them, which will result in trucks getting assigned to other jobs (dispatch isn't going to leave trucks idle on the chance that a customer might bump up a load), result in crappy service, further delays and the potential rejection of an entire house's worth of footings.  \n  \nThe contractor went with option B, figuring at least that way he isn't paying for standby as well.  I showed up on the load where the inspector decided he had seen enough cold joints (fresh concrete poured against hardened concrete forms a very weak bond, and absolutely not something you want in a footing a mile off the San Andreas fault line).  He rejects the entire house, and tells the contractor he's not approving anything else unless they get their shit together.  Instead, the crew chief, who we will call Taz, proceeds to lose his shit in a whirlwind of fecality.  He yells at me for the crappy service.  He yells at the crew for not working fast enough.  He yells at the inspector for rejecting the footings.  Then he comes back to me and yells about the full truck that he now has to do something with.  Fortunately, Taz has some walkways and patios formed up across the street.  Unfortunately, Taz is about as skilled at communication as his namesake.  \n  \nWhen you are working on a construction site, communication is important.  This is especially true when working around heavy machinery.  With concrete mixers, this is generally done by [hand signals](https://www.ihsa.ca/PDFs/Products/Id/W013.pdf) and whistle signals.  If the signals aren't clear, or more than one person is giving signals, bad things can happen, so usually, if the driver doesn't understand or isn't sure what signal is trying to be given, they won't react until a clear signal is given.  This tends to annoy contractors who haven't bothered to learn the standard signals.  The one I see most often is using \"stop the truck,\" instead of \"stop the drum,\" which usually results in the chute man standing there, pissed off because he now ankle-deep in caustic mud, though I did once run into a guy who never used the same stop signal twice in a row.  We were pouring several dozen fence posts.  It was awesome.  \n  \nTaz's big problem is that his can't seem to decide if he is pointing up or forward.  In order to reach all the way back, we are pouring with three extension chutes.  As concrete fills those chutes, they drop down from the weight.  When Taz points with his hand at about 45 degrees.  Taz is leaning over my chutes and not watching as he does this, so I decide he doesn't want to to clock him with my chutes, and I pull forward.  The glare Taz throws me makes it clear:  I am obviously the biggest idiot on the planet, and it's a miracle that I don't forget how to breathe.  A few seconds later, Taz whistles for me to pull forward.  I don't realize this.  Taz and the other members of his crew have been whistling back and forth to get each others' attention the entire time I've been there, and my Silbo Gomero is a bit rusty.  \n  \nTaz finally stalks over to me and asks if I'm stupid.  Then he tells me that when he gives me a signal, he expects me to follow it.  I tell him that he needs to give clear signals, and if he plans on using whistles to signal me, he should be the only one on the job whistling.  I also warn him to watch that rear chute when he has me raise it; the hydraulics are cranked up to 11 on the lift system, and those chutes kick like a Yugoslav mule (my truck's party trick was flipping that third chute over when empty).  We finish that patio, Taz scrapes down the chute, and we move to the next one.  They back me in so the end of the chute is inside a covered entryway.  It is too dark to see the end of the chute or Taz, but his hand shoots out into the light pointing at its 45 degree angle.  I can't see him, but to reach like that, he's probably leaning over the chute, so I wait for him to get clear.  He doesn't.  Instead, he points even more insistently.  So I pull forward a notch, and Taz comes whirling and gibbering out of the shadows.  \n  \nAgain the question, am I stupid.  I say no, but I'm not going to raise that chute until he gets clear of it.  Taz snaps back, \"Don't worry about me, just do what I tell you to.  If I come back out here again, I'm going to have you barred from the site.\"  Taz is just a subcontractor, and he doesn't have that power; he can tell me not to come back to their specific job that day, and might (*might*) be able to get his contractor to request I not be on their jobs out there, but he's going to have to spin some serious yarns for that (and hope nobody asks the inspector what was going on).  Still, he's been warned (twice) and threatened my job.  At this point, I've done what I can and have so few fucks left to give, I make Vibidia look like Messalina; if he wants me to raise that chute, that chute is getting raised.\n  \nSo Taz wanders back into the entryway, signalling to start pouring.  Right as the drum starts turning, he realizes the chute is still too low.  Arm shoots out.  I stab the button.  Arm disappears.  A few seconds later, someone else pops their head out, frantically signalling me to stop.  It turns out that, just like I warned him, that chute came up and caught Taz in the chin, knocking him into the corner on his ass.  And, because Resistentialism is one of the fundamental laws of reality, the chute slowly drifted to his side as the concrete began to pour out, dribbling a thick arc of the stuff straight across his lap (as well as pooling around him).  \n  \nWhen we went back to finish the footings a couple days later with a hard rock [trailer pump](http://www.schwing-stetter.co.uk/Images/Content/SP1800StaticPump.png)(Yes, this industry is populated by overgrown man-children), I found out that Taz did try to get me booted from the site when he got back to his yard.  Turns out he was already too late; the inspector had called to let their QC know why he had rejected an entire house footing, and added in most of the crap that followed.  They moved Taz to another job (for going off on his own crew, not for his conflict with me).  \n  \nTL/DR:  Angry foreman threatens to have me booted from a job site if I don't start following his signals.  Gives me a signal while I can only see his arm and winds up with a chute to the head (and one for Jenny and the wimp) and a lap full of concrete.",

        "text": "I used to work in a dry cleaners who offered a loyalty club that gave you a 10% discount when you had their card. They started a new customer offer where you got 20% off if you joined, with a joining fee of £9.95 (one off payment for the year, there was an option for yearly payment but we didn't really try sell that). So if you spent over £50 you'd be joining for free basically, and then anything further during the year you'd get a 10% discount. \n\nWe cleaned wedding dresses and we knew if one came in it was an easy sell, as the dresses were at least £80-90 to clean, increasing in cost depending on the value of the dress due to insurance etc, so by joining the club they'd be saving money by joining.  \n\nGot a customer with a dress, it was a nice one too, was gonna cost about £140 to clean (I know). I explained the club and how by joining you get 20% off, even said how much she would save net after the joining fee. She scoffed at me and didn't want to get unsolicited post or emails. I explained that I can select the option for no contact and that it would be less money for her if I put the club and she wouldn't need to do anything, I'm just saving her money. \n\nAt this point I could have just put the club on, got my sale and have it cost less for her. However, she sneered at me and declined very rudely again, so I let her pay £140 rather than £122 (20% off and joining fee). \n\nEdit: to add clarity on the fee being a one off not a yearly sub\n\nEdit 2: a lot of you have said how you'd decline in order to not give out personal information, which is more than fair. This was a little over 10 years ago and people in general were a lot more naive about data mining and companies selling data on. Also, the only information I needed was phone number and surname, which is what I had to take anyway for us to be able to contact her when the dress came back in the shop. There weren't any additional steps or extra information required for her to get the discount. ",

We run 24/7 so I work the night shift. Part of that is delivery to industrial customers, one of our major clients has a tendency to double/triple their usage and they typically only give a 5 minute heads up. \n\nNaturally when that happens there's a scramble to create a game plan to survive the gas induced onslaught. So upper management created a policy that if the usage exceeds this amount then notify these people. They also included a section that says voicemails, texts, and emails dont count and it has to be a  confirmed receipt.\n\nNow I get the call at about 2am one Saturday night, \"Hey this is Guy from Plant. We're going up to __/hour for the next 12 hours\".  \n\nWe had just finished a stretch of that happening so our labor resources were stretched thin. Guy 1 that I need to notify hadn't slept in 36 hours. After 3 attempts his wife picks up. She's a sweetheart and I apologize profusely, decide not to wake this guy up because he's a very valuable asset and I didn't want to push until he breaks. So I call his #2 (not apart of the new policy) and he handles the situation.\n\nOnto the malicious compliance. I still needed a positive receipt that Plant was going high-flow for gas. I called OC, on call, every 5 minutes. After the first few attempts I figure he put his phone on do not disturb, but I needed a confirmation. So I kept calling and leaving a voicemail. Every 5-10 minutes for 6 hours. Somewhere around the 6th message i started including animal facts, most were about the platypus. \n\nHe's a good guy and got a kick out of it. Sent me an email saying he appreciated my dedication. \n\nTLDR: I needed a confirmation of on-call receiving my message, so I called him 40+ times in 6 hours and left him animal facts in the voicemails.\n\nEDIT: Since people want to know about the platypus... Males have a venomous spur on their hind legs. They are one of two mammals that lay eggs, the reason they're still mammals is that they feed on their mothers mammary glands (which are glands that 'sweat' milk, not actual nipples). Their bills, although soft, are filled with receptors so that they can hunt with electrical signals. The platypus will use gravel at the bottom of a river to 'chew' since they dont have teeth. It also doesn't have a stomach.",

I am the entire Marketing Department, and over the years (and due to the complete lack of any real marketing from the bank) the position has accumulated various tasks from across the bank that are decidedly NOT marketing. Examples would be creating and editing forms, ordering loan documents, providing technical support for literally anything and everything, and editing the company website for compliance (in case you don't know, a compliance department for a bank is composed of the most analytical, robotic, and humorless people that mankind can produce). \n\nThey had requested an edit to a page that I had been working on for about 3 weeks to get it up to standards and constantly sending VERY minor changes (though not for the last week). When I was close to finishing the project I sent an email letting them know that I would have it ready to upload to the live site within the next day or two. At which point I was told that the project had been canceled and they wanted to revert the page back to the original. This project had reserved many many hours  of my time and taken the place of several other projects. I was pissed, they couldn't even have the decency to let me know when they decided to stop it a full week before I found out. \n\nWhich gets us to the malicious part, a few months back I had to review one of our policies about marketing (which included the website edits for some reason) and came across the following sentence\n\n\"*insert bank name* does not allow nor participate in *coding* or the manipulation of computer code, under any circumstances\"\n\nThis wasn't exactly a surprise to me at the time as our average employee age is probably 50 or more, we aren't the most tech oriented bank if you couldn't tell. FIgured I would just not enlighten them as to how I was completing the requested edits to the website.....\n\nBut now I had some motivation to start following the policy, and let them know that i would be \"unable to perform the requested change back to the original page, as it will require me to edit code\" \n\nTo keep this reasonably short I'll summarize the next 6 weeks, compliance had to figure out what *coding* actually is, rewrite 8 different policies, and have them all individually approved by the board of directors and the executive team before they were allowed to request that I make the changes. \n\nDo I feel petty, yes, and validated. Using policy against bureaucratic robots makes me happy\n\ntl;dr Actual compliance department has their own policy used against them because they couldn't be bothered to find out what coding is.",

        "text": "TLDR : When IT want to test, let them test!\n\nAV = Anti Virus!\n\nThrow away account because I like being able to work. \n\nI work in the IT field and this story takes place a few months ago. \n\nThe key players. \n\nSA- Sysadmin (disgruntled and at the end of his rope)\n\nMA- Massive asshole. (IT \"director\". Reactionary and inept)\n\nCW- a casualty of war (it support fresh out of college)\n\n\n\nWhile doing some short term contract work I had a project to upgrade the existing and still valid AV system that was based out of Russia. \n\nWhat I thought was a no rush project, as there were a few months left on the license quickly turned into a \"needs to be done next week so the Russians don't get out data.\"\n\nI was already set on what system to go for, so I got the central server installed and spoke SA about testing. He goes to his boss MA to discuss weekend testing. He gets refused and chewed out for wasting time. In front of the entire office. \n\nMA- \"it's a simple anti virus install. My kid did it on my home pc last night in 10 minute's. I want you both to roll it out tonight. I'm tired of your shit. Get it done right tonight or don't bother coming back tomorrow\"\n\nTonight being Thursday. \n\nNow the environment is multi site all talking back to head office. They ship things all over the world.  \nThere are easily 200 computers over 15 locations. Not a massive environment. But a pain for 2 people. \nMost of the software is custom and pretty old. Purpose built for this company. \n\nSA and I talk. MA is a dick. We'd already bonded on the previous month's about how we hate him. \n\nSA says let's do it. Lets just get it done. \n\nSo we do. Removal goes ok. With about 30 computers needing manual intervention due to remote install failing. \n\nRoll out goes great. Nice and seamless. Pretty easy leaving all defaults. \nHand over the reigns to SA so he can lock me out as the project has been completed and my part done. \n\nWe finish at about 4am and head to get some sleep. \n\nI should also mention, I've got approved leave starting that day and a 1pm flight to my home country for a wedding. \n\nAt 8 am my phone starts lighting up. \n\nMA is going ballistic. None of the systems are working. Apparently all the computers are infected with a virus. \n\nI ask what SA is doing about it. \n\nNow I know full well what SA is doing. He left his resignation letter on the MA's boss' desk at 4am. So he will be asleep with his phone off. \n\nMA tells me to forget about him and just fix it. \n\nWhat about CW?\n\nFull on panic mode. He is adamant every machine is infected. He has the details to log in but doesn't know what he is doing. And deleting everything in the central quarantine to stop the virus. \n\nI agree to go in but can only be there for an hour or two because of my flight. \n\nOnce I get there it's clear what's happening. \nMassive false positives across all computers as they are running the same software. \n\n But we can't add exceptions now as CW has deleted the files that were \"infected\"\n\nThis leaves one option. Install the software again on 200 machine's. \nEach one would need to be done manually. Or via script. But CW doesn't know how to do that and I had a flight to catch. \n\nSo I leave with MA screaming abuse at me and CW phoning the external support company they use. \n\nWhen I got back from the wedding a couple of weeks later, I see SA walking in as I go back to the office to finish my contract term. He is all smiles. \n\nThe fallout \n\nMA was fired. SA is temporarily filling his role while they recruit for his position.\n\nThey lost over a days worth of productivity so about 1million dollars. \nPlus the relatively small change for the third party support. \n \nEdit : Speellings and clarifications \n\n\n",

They told her that they'd also be happy to replace the bulb, and that they \"only charge for parts! labor is free! it's only and additional $30 for us to do the bulb too!\"\n\nWithout missing a beat, she said \"oh great! I actually have a brand new bulb, so you guys can just put that in, and since you only charge for parts, it's free, right? that's very kind of you!\"\n\nThey looked a little dumbfounded, but (somewhat grumply) agreed to put her new bulb in for free. \n\nEdit: wrote this then left for the weekend.

I knew that this project was going to provide 0 value to anyone in the agency and they were just giving it to me as busy work. Everyone else knew this to be true. But my boss, decided to pretend it was really serious and continually just try and pressure me to do it in ways that were just lying like 'James (the boss of the whole office) is going to be furious if this isn't done' like ??? he does not give 1 fuck about this project it is useless and he and I know it.\n\nAnyway, I'm currently studying History and Politics which means I'm fairly used to writing long essays about this kinda shit. I decided, if you want a project, you can have a project, but it's gonna be more than you asked for. I ended up writing 22 pages, with 8 dedicated to the history of globalization (a fairly minor question in the assignment). The catch? It all has to be written in Spanish which is my second language. So I wrote all of that in English, then translated it all myself. Now my boss has to read through every line and correct it (which will take hours), or admit that no one ever cared and leave it be.

(Apologies for formatting, I'm on mobile)\n\nTL;DR at the end.\n\n\nM=Me\nAL=Angry Lady\n\n\nMe: Welcome to credit card services! :) How may I help you?\n\n\nAL: *already has an aggressive tone* There's a late fee on my account. You best remove it right now because I do not pay late!\n\n\nMe: Late fees can be upsetting especially if you're paying on time. I'm happy to take a look and see what I can do. *Brings up account, sees multiple late payments this year alone.*\n\n\nAL: Thank you. Can you see the fee? Take it off. I have a perfect credit score and it's gonna stay that way. \n\n\nMe: *thinking: suuure you do!* This account had a late payment fee removed for $38 in January.  I am unable to remove another one since these fees are agreed upon with use of the credit card.\n\n\nAL: WHAAAAT!? HOW DARE YOU GET SMART WITH ME! That was back in January and it wasnt my fault! I get off work at 8pm and that is after the cut off time!\n\n\nMe: It can be tricky at times to meet the payment deadline especially if you get off late.  Have you considered setting up autopay or perhaps paying in the morning or the day before?\n\n\nAL: Look. I dont have time for all that! I have been a customer for years and I have never once been late! This is bad customer service! You will take that fee off or get me your supervisor!\n\n\n(Note: we can only remove 2nd late fees if the customer asks to close their account. We are not allowed to offer this proactively. Supervisors can remove 2nd late fees in special circumstances, but I won't waste a supervisor's time with someone so rude and demanding.)\n\n\nMe: As I mentioned we have already adjusted a fee on this account. You have been a guest with us since 2016 and of course your business is greatly valued. :) I am here to serve you. I do see a few late payments on this account.  I am happy to get the due date changed to prevent the upcoming late fee and give the payment more time to post so this doesnt happen in the future.\n\n\nAL: GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR!Dont you get smart with me! I have attorney representation and you cannot rob me like this! You best take off every single fee because I am never late!\n\n\n(Note: remember I said we take legalities very seriously? The second a customer says this we have to place a block on the credit card account so it cannot be used and notate the attorney's information. The customer has to send a request in writing to get the block removed)\n\n\nMe: Ms. Angry Lady, we are more than willing to work with your attorney if that is what you prefer.  May I please have their name and phone number?\n\n\nAL: Just get me your supervisor! Dont you get smart with me!(x3)\n\n\nMe:Ms. Angry Lady, I am here to help you as best as I can. Its crucial that we cooperate with any legal requests. If your attorney is representing you for this late fee, then I will need their informtion.\n\n\nAL: Tom.  Tom Berger. His number is 1-800-555-555. \n\n\nMe: Thank you Ms. Angry Lady. Please hold while I connect you to a Supervisor .\n\n\n\n-on the other line while AL is on hold- \n\n\nSupervisor: (after I explain what's happened) Well, now she cant do anything at all with the account! *laughs* She should've just asked to close the account. She sure shot herself in the foot on this one.\n\n\nMe: or she could've just been polite and I would've sent a request to my supervisor!\n\n\nSupervisor: Well, send her through and I'll just reiterate what you already told her.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Rude angry lady demands multiple late fees waived. We already removed one as a courtesy. Instead of letting me help with changing the due date to prevent the upcoming fee, she threatened legal action and now gets nothing.",

For those of you who have never been, the only hot n ready pizzas are the most frequently ordered: cheese, pepperoni, and three meat treat (their version of meat lovers) as these fly off the selves, anything less common is made to order. \n\nOne day a woman came in asking for a pepper and onion pizza, when I told her it would be 10 minutes she started flipping out that we were false advertising. She went on to say how she could literally see the hot n ready pizzas stacked behind me and I was holding out on her. I pulled one out to show her there are no pepper and onion pizzas ready but the kitchen has already started making her order so it won't be long.\n\nShe then demanded I take a hot 'n ready cheese pizza and put peppers and onions on it. I tried to explain that's not how our operating procedures work and the health hazards behind throwing raw ingredients on a pizza that has been sitting out but she couldn't be convinced. After being verbally berated, I went in the back and put some peppers and onion on the cheese pizza just like she asked, much to her surprise the peppers and onions were frozen! This only further escalated her. \n\nShe then demanded that I take the already cooked pizza (which was already dry from sitting under a heat lamp) with the frozen peppers and onions and put it through the oven. This time without protest I followed her instructions. IDK why she was surprised when the already cooked crust and cheese came out completely burnt, that's how ovens work. \n\nAt this point she asked for my manager who was completely chill about me wasting a pizza to make this lady's point and was able to calm her down enough to wait the 10 minutes for a new pizza.

I do simple things like call customers, give estimates and prices on jobs and parts, handle money for bills, etc.\n\nA middle-aged man came in, and he said he'd like to speak with the mechanic. There's only two mechanics usually - my dad and another man. They don't like to be bothered in the middle of working (understandably), so I try to answer as many questions for the customers as I can before I have to have them come up front.\n\nI said \"Our mechanics are a little tied up at the moment. Can I ask what you need help with?\"\n\nThe man laughed and shook his head. \"It's a man thing, sweetheart. You wouldn't understand.\"\n\nOkay. That pisses me off, but whatever.\n\n\"Okay. I'll just need to know what you want me to tell the mechanic, and I'll bring him up front.\" I'm still being very polite.\n\n\"Tell him I need him to give me an estimate on how much it'll cost for a brake job and a couple other things,\" he said, looking at the magazines and not really at me anymore.\n\nI want to laugh, but instead I decide to get the mechanic. My dad is busy, so I get the other guy. We'll call him John. I tell him what the customer said, and John shakes his head.\n\nWe go back into the office together, and the guy shakes his hand and starts talking about car troubles, blah blah blah. I just sit and wait.\n\nJohn and the customer talk about what kind of job he wants done. They get the details down and the customer starts talking about prices.\n\n\"So I came here to ask how much do think all this is gonna cost me?\" Customer looks at John expectantly.\n\nJohn shrugs his shoulders. \"I don't know about that. Maybe a ballpark estimate, but she's in charge of the pricing.\" John points to me. I smile and give him a little wave from my desk.\n\nJohn goes back into the back of the garage, leaving me and the customer up front.\n\nThe guy has the decency to look mildly embarrassed. \"So how much is that going to cost me?\"\n\nI smirk. \"Well it was gonna be (this much), but it looks like your price just went up.\" He sputters magnificently, and I chuckle. \"I'm just kidding. It'll be (this much).\"\n\nThe guy gives me a nervous laugh and mutters something about the price being good. He gets a good, fair estimate, gets put in his place, and everyone's happy at the end of the day.\n\nOnly thing that would have been better is if we'd had a female mechanic. I would have died laughing.\n\nEdit: don't know how grammar good",

        "text": "Sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile. Throwaway account because I still work here and my talkative coworkers are on Reddit. \n\nTo preface this story, I work in a grocery store. This isn't just any grocery store, this is one of the busier stores in the entire district, with my specific department being *the* busiest department in our store. Most people who come to this department quickly move to another, because our work is back-to-back with no downtime in-between.\n\nI pride myself on being a hard worker, no matter what. I always strive to learn more, do more, be more. I make myself a necessary asset because it gives me a lot of influence. In my department, I am a part timer, but I do just as much work as our departments managers. Without me, the department would be well fucked, because no other part timer is willing to do the work I do. \n\nWhat exactly do I do that other part timers don't? I place orders, adjust inventory, handle DSD (direct store delivery) receiving, KLT (known loss tracking), markdowns, 5am shifts to hang tags, 5am shifts to deep clean vital sections, overnights on holiday weeks, endcap planning/changing, etc. \n\nIt's a lot of work, way more work than I *should* be doing, but the benefit is that all the managers know how much I do and leave me the fuck alone. All managers, except K.\n\nK is our front end manager (we also have a main perishable manager, assistant store manager, and store manager). She is a mean spirited person who is awful at her job. She's never paying attention to what the other departments are doing (hence, she doesn't realize how vital I am to our dept), but she insists on acting like she does. I've heard multiple complaints from others in my departments that K tells them they are slacking and need to get more work done; I know full well this isn't the case and she just wants someone to bitch at. \n\nOne day I'm on break. We get two 15 minute breaks, and one 30 minute lunch. I decided to combine my two 15s into one half hour break, because my grandmother recently broke her rib and I was trying to coordinate with family about who could take care of her and when. \n\nK walks back into the break room once, then again later. She makes some sly comment about me taking my break so early in my shift, so I explained to her that it wasn't early at all and thought nothing of it. \n\nI guess K didn't like my tone of voice or something, because an hour later she calls me into the office. Turns out she had checked the cameras in the break room and caught me taking an extended break. Before I even had a chance to speak, she went on a rant about how the department looks like garbage and it must be my fault since she caught me doing this (the department looked awful because my manager didn't order enough product, there is nothing I can do about that). \n\nI finally was able to speak and tried explaining to her that I only combined my two breaks into one. She asked if I knew I wasn't supposed to do that, which I told her I did. \"Well then,\" she said, \"if you know you shouldn't be doing it, then just don't do it in the first place.\" \n\nGame, set, match. I wanted so badly to exact my MC immediately, but I knew the bigger, badder managers would be in tomorrow along with her, and I knew they would absolutely rip her a new asshole for what I was about to do. \n\nI took the time to write out my new availability on paper. No more overnights, check. No more hanging tags or cleaning, check. I also wrote down my request for a $2 pay raise if they'd like me to continue doing all the other things the other part timers don't have to do, along with a list of what exactly those responsibilities were. \n\nI went over to the managers office, and saw K sitting alone. *Perfect.* I said nothing and simply handed her the paper. She looked confused at first, and asked me what this was. I explained to her that those are all the things I shouldn't be doing, since I'm not getting paid for them and they aren't a part of my job description being just a part timer.\n\n I've never seen a look of pure despair on a person's face until that day. She first got angry at me, told me that I shouldn't be overblowing things. When it was clear that her being angry with me was only making my moment sweeter, she tried reasoning with me (really, this was just her reexplaining why I was wrong in nicer words). I wasn't having any of it.  I told her that we could have a meeting with the other managers to discuss it if she'd like. Not to my surprise, she declined that offer.\n\nShortly thereafter, I was questioned by the other managers, separetly, why I was doing this. I explained how she checked the cameras on me during my extended break, and told them all about our conversation where she accused me being responsible for the state of our department. \n\nThe assistant store manager directly told me that she shouldn't have done what she did, that she would talk to her, and that if she ever even bothered me again that I should immediately notify one of the other managers. Since that day, K has been nothing but an angel to me. \n\nThat $2 raise was pretty sweet too.",

At this restaurant, the cooks place cooked food on a table for the waiters/waitresses to take to the customers. the waiters/waitresses had to use protection(oven pad/mitt) to deliver the food to the customer.  There was one waitress that never used either, just her bare hands. \n\nThis waitress one day requested my supervisor to make a plate for a customer. So my supervisor did his job, and placed the plate on the table. The waitress didnt come for the food for at least an hour. And when the waitress finally got the plate, she had to return it to my supervisor to heat it up. Knowing this waitress never used the oven pads or oven mitts, he didnt just heat up the food, he heated up the ENTIRE PLATE, and placed it back on the table. The waitress got the plate at a reasonable time, and screamed as she scorched her hand on the plate fresh from the oven. \n\nHe had a talk with his manager about the incident, and my supervisor took a break for 20 years from cooking.

        "text": "*Sincere thanks to /u/Flomelli95 who had an experience so similar to this that it reminded me of the story.*\n\nThis story is not my own, but my sisters.\n\nMy sister works retail. She works in a home improvement store that caters mostly to the professional painters in the area, but also sells wallpapers, tilings, kitchen cabinets and some artistic stuff like frames, brushes and very expensive artist paint in any imaginable colour.\n\nLunch was usually pretty busy in the store, so once that settled down a bit, the store staff started having their own lunch breaks. The owner had a child with a heart condition, and it was not particular unusual that he went away on extra long lunches early in the afternoon after saying *\"it's gonna be a long one today. Hospital appointment.\"*\n\nThis was indeed the slow hour of the day, and no-one raised an eyebrow as he went on a medical appointment with his child. They functioned sort-of like an extended family anyway in the store. They had all met his entire family. Knew the kid and his struggles.\n\nMy sister started working late that day, in this business this means coming to work at 7. Her colleague had been there since 6 and was dying for a chance to sit down for a while.\n\nSis was left running the store on her own, and went on with her usual duties that involved restocking a section of shelves here and there in the store, while helping the occasional customer that came strolling in.\n\nShe started feeling her own hunger grow on her, had a glance at the watch and realised that her lunch was due in about ten minutes.\n\nIn through the door strolls an elderly gentleman, obviously dressed up for the occasion of going out shopping. Silk suit, bowtie and hat. And a well polished walking cane, that he needed to confidently walk across the store floor.\n\nHe walks half the way up to the register, and stops.\n\nMy sister looks up, greets him and suggests he wants help with something. He does, but he is a bit picky with who he gets his help from.\n\n*\"I want a man to help me.\"*\n\n*\"Yeah. In that case you will have to wait a while, because the owner went out on an extra long lunch. I honestly can't predict when he comes back again.\"*\n\n*\"Alright. I'll wait, then.\"*\n\n*\"Are you sure that I can't try to help you right now instead?\"*\n\n*\"Yes. I'm sure. I need the help from a man.\"*\n\n*\"Well. Alright then. We got complimentary coffee and cookies, please have a cup while you wait in the couch over there.\"*\n\nShe then went on with her restocking.\n\nHer colleague came back from her lunch. They had a quick conversation about the customer on the couch and her colleague too decided that she was gonna try and help him.\n\nMy sisters colleague was the type of gal who had her own gravitational field, of sorts. Blonde, petite and some awesome wiggly bits at the front. Guys younger than 90 often more or less automatically came to her first thing after getting through the door, ignoring the number dispenser that they literally had to walk around to get onto the sales floor.\n\nThe elderly man was either blind, or very, very set in his ways. She had no luck convincing him either.\n\nThe upcoming hour consisted of them both doing their own restocking and helping the customers who came walking in. And the occasional \"are you *sure* that we can't help you with anything?\" over by the couch.\n\nAfter a 2h30min lunch, or thereabout, the owner came back. Something had borked completely with the appointment and he came back stressed up to cranky *and* hungry.\n\nThe elderly gentleman heard the male voice, stood up and walked over.\n\nMy sister and her colleague didn't really have time to fetch the poor owner and tell him what what going on, and had to let this play out a lot more spontaneous than they would have preferred.\n\nIt turned out that the elderly gentleman had some questions about their brand of artist paint. Pretty advanced questions. Questions that the owner didn't really care about as long as someone *bought* the damns tubes at intervals that motivated stocking them in the first place. it was, to put it mildly, not really his area of expertise.\n\nHe told the elderly man this.\n\n*\"Oh. I honestly don't know anything about those. You'll have to speak to **Sister**, she is the one who went to art school.\"*\n\nAnd, with that, he went to the back for a well-deserved chair and some food.",

I arrive for work and wait till we start. When we start I head to my location and once there I start working and take off the load from my colleagues from the shift before me. After an hour, we hit a bump, a small problem... One of the packaging machines had malfunctioned and a big box with our material was stuck in the machine. Luckily I know how to solve this without causing any major damage to our material. However, here is where the fun begins. Me is, well me and let's call the other dude L.\n\nMe: Aw crap, this is gonna be fun...\n\nL: Well shit, how are we gonna solve this??!?\n\nMe: Well luckily I've been through this once befo....\n\nL: Shutup, you're a summerworker and not an employee and also I've worked here for 5 years.\n\nMe: But, wouldn't it just be easier if we....\n\nL: NO. WE DO WHAT I SAY.\n\ninside I am just thinking \"well shit, maybe I should just back off. This is none of my business if he fucks this up\"\n\nI grab my phone out of my pocket and quickly starts recording audio.\n\nMe: So are you sure you want to do it your way? Because it sure would be easier my way and we might not drop our materials worth €5000.\n\nL: YES, now help me out.\n\nMe: Okay but you have to take full responsibility if we make some mistake.\n\nL: yeah yeah sure come over now.\n\nI walk over and he wants me to press some buttons to lower the lift inside the machine while he makes sure it doesn't go below one specific opening in the machine. If it goes below the opening, we need to call over some mechanics and electricians.\n\nL: Down, down, down, down, do... STOP!!!!!!\n\nIt goes below the opening.\n\nMe: I told you this was a stupid idea.\n\nL: ITS ALL YOUR FAULT, IF ONLY WE HAD COMPETENT WORKERS HERE AND NO IDIOTS.\n\nL: Lemme fix this.\n\nHe goes over to the buttons and starts tapping some of them and he just happens to press the button that says unload. Now the machine had dropped our box down about 2m and a lot of the material was destroyed.\n\nI realize I am still recording.\n\nL walks to boss office will I wait for electricians and mechanics. Suddenly the boss comes storming out and yells at me \"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE DESTROYING OUR MACHINE AND MATERIALS!?!?\"\n\nI remain calm and tell him \"Let's go into your office\"\n\nWe walk into his office while L stays at the machine. I grab my phone and play the audio of L wanting to do his idea instead of mine and him claiming full responsibility. I even recorded when he called me an idiot. Boss is baffled and just walks out and calls L over and asks him to come into his office.\n\nI didn't see L again.",

I had been with this company for a little over a year and knew more than enough to answer most questions and handle most print jobs. \nI was working with this gentleman who had started very recently and was still asking a lot of questions about the job, I'll call him NG (New Guy). \nOne day this gentleman (Cust.) walks into the store and he approaches the counter, naturally I walk up.\n\nFC: \"Hi there, how can I help you today?\"\n\nCust.: \"I want to talk to a man.\"\n\nI was naturally pretty offended, but I've been working retail for about 4 years now and know that some customers are just like that. And maybe it was a slightly private male thing I might have been freaked out over. As it happened, the only male employee working at the time was NG. I had an idea of how this was going to go, so I smiled at him.\n\nFC: \"Sure, give me just a minute.\"\n\nI walked over to NG and he happily asked what he could do. I told him that this gentleman just wanted to talk to a man. He seemed a little confused but went over to see what he wanted.\n\nNG: \"What can I do for you today, sir?\"\n\nCust.: \"I was wondering if you can print onto mugs.\"\n\nNG: \"Um, one second.\" He turns around to look at me. \"Hey FC, can we print onto mugs?\"\n\nThe look on Cust.'s face was priceless as I told him that we could not, but could print custom mugs that would take a week to come in and cost $25. \n\nCust.: \"That's not soon enough! I'll take my business elsewhere.\"\n\nFC: \"Have a nice day!\"\n\nTL;DR: Male customer came in and I went to help (I'm a young female) and asked to see a man. I grabbed the only male worker/new guy who had to turn around and ask me the question anyway. \n\nNote: Not entirely sure this belongs here but I thought it was pretty funny.",

        "text": "I've been thoroughly enjoying this sub while regretting I couldn't contribute, but reading an account about some MC from high school dredged up this gem from the dusty archives of my memory.\n\nWay back in the Stone Age when I was in high school (grades 9-12, ages ~13-18 for the non-Americans) I was a bit of a nerd. Actually, I was a *huge* nerd. I was the nerd even the other nerds picked on. I had all the stereotypes: thick glasses, awkward with girls, high academic IQ with low social IQ, etc. None of this really bothered me as I was a cocky little shit who thought he was smarter than most (which I was, but I hadn't learned to be humble about it yet).\n\nI was a member of our school's Academic Team, whose primary activity was competing against other area schools in \"Quick Recall,\" which was a \"quiz bowl\"-type format where a moderator asks questions and the first to buzz in with the correct answer earns points for their team (school). Our school had a top-notch team, and we routinely whipped the other area schools and competed well at the state level.\n\nRemember how I said even the other nerds picked on me? I took as good-natured ribbing from the others on my grade level, but my sophomore year (10th grade), there was a freshman (9th) on the Academic Team who figured out that I was the \"default\" target and went massively overboard, going out of his way to make everything a dig on me. I'll call him Little Punk (LP).\n\nSo one day after school we're having Academic Team practice (which officially involved us studying up on common subjects, but practically was a bunch of nerds being nerds) and someone has chewing gum in their mouth, which, while technically against school rules, doesn't bother our coach--until they start popping it. Our coach, annoyed, says, \"OK, whoever has the chewing gum, spit it out.\"\n\nLP, seizing the opportunity to pick on me, says, \"You heard her, Caddage, spit it out!\" And holds his hand out in front of my face.\n\nSo I spit in it.\n\nThere is a brief moment of stunned silence in the room, and then everyone (except LP) starts dying laughing, including the coach. LP, meanwhile, looks like someone just told him they pissed in his apple juice after he had already finished it.\n\nEven now, after more than 25 years, remembering the look of shock, horror, and disgust on his face fills my heart with malicious glee.\n\nEDIT: as I did not make it sufficiently clear, I was not chewing gum, and LP *knew* I was not chewing gum. He was just being, well, a Little Punk.\n\nEDIT2: apologies because apparently I still haven't figured out how to call myself smart without sounding like a pretentious douche.",

My sister started smoking at 13 at a time when our asthma wasn't horrific. Once she was legally old enough to smoke, she would go to the hospitals smoking area a couple of times a day while she was in. She got told to stop doing that when she was in for asthma and was encouraged to quit by nurses and doctors alike.\n\nWhen we got to about 19 she decided she needed to give up, but really struggled. She told the doctor and nurses that she had given up and told me I wasn't allowed to tell them she was smoking. We always went to appointments together, so it wasn't really an issue. She would generally not smoke for the morning before she saw the doctor.\n\nOne time, I was in hospital and my doctor came to see me. He was checking me over and said that he was seeing my sister that afternoon. He then asked the dreaded question. 'How is (twin) going with quitting smoking?' Now, I am a bad liar, especially when I like someone.  'I'm not allowed to tell you.' is what I said. There was a short silence and the doctor started laughing. My mother, who was there with me, thought it was brilliant too.\n\nTL:DR - My twin lies to her doctor that she isn't smoking. The doctor asks me when she's not there, and I tell him that I'm not allowed to tell him.",

My job is to do routine maintenance on beer systems in bars and restaurants and that includes repairs and replacement of parts. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nImportant to note is that I am contracted by multiple beer distributors. If something breaks on Guinness, Guinness’s distributor will contact me to do the repair. The account is charged for labor and the part, but if I’m there already doing maintenance, I’ll do the repair and only charge for the part. So instead of $130 for a service call plus parts, they would only pay $30 for parts. Anywho, on to the story.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo one day I was on a route and I stopped in at a small indian restaurant. 4 taps, tiny little keg box, super easy set up. But when I walked in, they had a broken faucet. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSM will be for silly manager and M will be me:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; M: Hey there, I see your faucet is broken. Would you like me to replace it while I’m here?\n\n&gt; SM: How much will it cost?\n\n&gt; M: $30\n\n&gt; SM: (suddenly angry) No, no, I will call the distributor and get it cheaper.\n\n&gt; M: I am the distributor.\n\n&gt; SM: No no I have a guy and he will get me a better price.\n\n&gt; M: Yes, that is your sales rep. He will call me after he calls the distributor and then they will call me and I will tell you the same thing.\n\n&gt; SM: No, do not fix the part, I will call my guy. \n\n&gt; M: Your beer will be down, you’ll lose money, and then you’ll have to pay an extra $100 for me to come back and have this exact same conversation with you. \n\n&gt; SM: I will call my guy. \n\n&gt; M: -shrugs- Okeydokey. Sounds good to me. (I tried, right?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo I leave the faucet broken and go home. It’s Friday. I get an emergency call on Saturday to go fix a broken faucet. I’m told since it’s a weekend call, they pay extra. Wonderful! And it just so happened to be the Indian restaurant. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; M: hello again! I’m here to fix your faucet.\n\n&gt; SM: how much will it cost?\n\n&gt; M: $180\n\n&gt; SM: What?!?! You said only $30! \n\n&gt; M: yes, that was on Friday when I was doing routine maintenance. I told you I could save you money but you refused. \n\n&gt; SM: -blankly staring-\n\n&gt; M: we will bill you electronically. Have a great rest of your weekend \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR: bar manager refused a repair for $30, ends up paying $150 extra**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNote: $ amounts are just examples and easy figures to use, and I heavily simplified the billing process for the sake of the story. Just FYI :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nedit: formatting",

        "text": "This story happens to me very recently while at work.  I didn’t want to share this story as it’s recent, but I have decided that I’m just going to change some things. \n\nThis story is too good.  I don’t want this memory to be lost in time, like tears in rain. (Blade Runner reference.  Best movie) \n\nI work in security, and it’s an easy job, real easy.  However sometimes things come along and you have to deal with them.  Like a naval personal banging on the door thinking it’s his ship (real drunk) \n\nMost of it is homeless, drug addicts, or drunks.  Easy stuff usually no problems.  The real issues are when people I’m working with, find it important to push their weight around.  \n\nQueue Mr BD (Big Dick). Now BD and I don’t have a lot of interactions.  We don’t really talk to one another.  Considering the building I’m in charge of is away from the rest of the company security.  \n\nSince that’s the case I have my own rules and guidelines.  They were approved by my superiors, for this specific building and for its environment.  \n\nThe building I work in has a lot of artistic types.  The places does commercials, ads, product placements.  You get the idea. \n\nThe head of marketing we will call him HM. Is in charge of everyone in that building. He talks to me on a very, very regular basis.  He comes to my office more than a few times a day to chat, smoke breaks and all that. \n\nIt’s very friendly, very simple.  Everyone knows the rules.  I talk to them all like I have been around for years. It’s a very wholesome place.  \n\nIt’s a normal day things are running fine.  Half the workers in the building are gone doing an off site shoot.  \n\nI get a phone call telling me that the custodial staff found lost money.  I thought it was weird, since no one stated they were missing money.  \n\nNo problem I’ll deal with it personally.  Now when someone says they found lost money, I think they found it in a common area.  You know in the bathroom, lounge, or cafeteria.  Some place like that.  \n\nI get the custodial staff member to take me to where they located the missing money.  He takes me to the highest floor and leads me to the office of.... You guessed it HM\n\nHe points to the desk and all I can say is “Ok,  umm how is it lost.?”  The money he is talking about is a nice stack of 100’s on HM’s desk. \n\nNow the stack of 100’s are clearly fake.  Not by how they look, but for the fact that they have pink Chinese writing on them.  It clearly states in Chinese that the bills are used for training.  \nIt’s usually used to teach Chinese bank tellers to count American money.\n\nHM uses the fake money to reward everyone.  Once every 6 months they get rid of all the stuff they can’t use for further sets.  They have a HUGE auction.  The only thing you can use, is the fake money. HM loves to say “Make it Rain.”  While he does the money shuffle.  It’s his favorite quote.   He passes it out like candy. \n\nI thanked the custodial staff for showing me, but it wasn’t a problem.  I fill out the paper work indicating the money was fake, and no actual money was missing.  I submit the paper work.  \n\nA few hours later I get a call from BD.  \n\nOP.  “Hello, This is OP, how can I help you?”\n\nBD “OP your paper worked is F’d. I’m looking at your report, about the missing money.  How do I know what you said is true?  How do I know you didn’t just take it, and claim it’s fake?”  \n\nOP “I clearly state what happened in the report, and what the mistake was.”  \n\nBD “Not good enough I have a report of stolen money and I can’t let this be tossed to the side, because you said so. you will get pictures and submit them as well.”  \n\nIt’s kinda a hassle for me to do this , but it’s not a big deal.  I can also see where he is coming from.\n\nOP “Ok, I just want to make it clear no one reported money being stolen.  Nor was any money actually missing.  However no problem I’ll take photos, but I promise you will laugh when you see the pictures of the money it’s clearly fake.”  I chuckle \n\nBD “OP who is in charge here?  You or me?”\n\nOP “I’m the supervisor of this building, if that’s what you mean.”  \n\nBD “NO OP, who is in charge of you.? It’s me, do what I tell you.  I don’t want to hear you back talk me.”\n\nOP. “Listen BD I meant no disrespect, I already told you I was going to take care of it.  Thank You for your call.”  I hang up after.  \n\nAs I walk back to HM’s desk.  It’s eating away at me how he talked to me.  We are a team and should respect one another.  He first called me a liar, accused me of stealing, then claimed I was disrespecting him.  \n\nOk perhaps he is having a bad day.  I haven’t really talked to him much. I let it go and proceed to take photos.\n\nTo be sure it’s clear where it’s located.  I take photos of the money, desk, office, surrounding area,and direct hallway location.  Just so the report showed everything. \n\nI resubmit the paper work with about 20 photos attracted. There should be no question as to what the money was, or what it was used for.  I clearly state why HM has it to begin with. \n\nAn hour latter I get another call it’s BD again.  \n\nBD “This report is still bad but it’s better.  I don’t believe this is fake money and I want you to confiscate it.  Turn it in for review.”\n\nOP “We don’t do that here.  This building has clear guidelines stating we don’t confiscate, and We don’t look in people’s bags when they come in.  This building has different rules.  Approved by CEO, HM, and Head of security. I can’t do what you are asking me to do.”\n\nBD “First of all OP.  I’m not asking you, I’m telling you.  Confiscate the bills, and if anyone else is seen with money confiscate it as well. I don’t believe  the heads would agree to such an unsafe protocol.” \n\nNow at this point I would make it clear that phone calls are recorded for “better costumer service.”  Everything he is saying is being recorded on his end and mine.  \n\nIt’s silent on the phone for a few seconds. While I think about this. I come up with an idea.  \n\nBD “HELLO?!!!!”\n\nOP” To confirm what you are saying.  You want me to go around and literally look into peoples bags against policy 50, and then confiscate any fake money they have, against policy 51?  \n\nBD “Stop trying to trip me up with your bs. Do your damn job, or I will fire you!!  Is that clear?!!!”  \n\nOP “You got it BD.”  \nBD hangs up \n\nIt’s very clear to me that this will go south real fast. I know I have to handle this perfectly, or I could be fired.  \n\nI write up an email explaining everything even connect the report to it.  I also clearly make statements about the conversation I had with BD. Making it very visible the order he demanded I carry out, and copy past of the policies it violates.  I cc Head of security, and HM.  \n\nThis guy either has it out for me, or doesn’t understand how the building and it’s rules. I’m not going to have him hang over my head like this.  Threatening my job, because he doesn’t want to understand. \n\nI know all I have to do is catch the right person, and BD is screwed.  I know the staff should be coming back soon from their shoot.\n\nI go down to the front of the building. I wait till I see the group coming back.  I stop them at the front door.  Stating “Excuse me who is lead of this group.”  “I am.” HM steps past some people.   \n\nHe looks at me with a confused look. \n\nHM “OP is something wrong??”\n\nI pull him aside and tell him the situation.  All the while he is waving people past him into the building.\n\nHM “What??  Are you serious? This is unacceptable.  I have known you for 2 years.  I’m not going to let this stand. Let me make some calls.  Can you shoot me an email of that report please?” \n\nOP “Already done.”  I smile at him \n\nHM “Did you know I would react this way?”\n\nOP “ I had a feeling you would in some way, after all you like to make it rain!!” \n\nHis face grows wide with a smile.  “MAKE IT RAIN!!” He does the money shuffle and starts walking away. \n\nHM “Don’t worry OP I like you to much to see you leave, I got this.” \n\nAbout an hour or so goes by, I get a call from HM.\n\nApparently BD claimed  I never said the money was on HM desk, or that it was fake.  He also said that I acted alone and with no orders from him.  BD completely denies threatening to fire me.\n\nOP”I see.... well it’s a good thing I recorded my conversations with him.”  \n\nHM “Wait you record all your phone calls?”\n\nOP “ if it’s on one of the security phones, like the one I’m on yes.”\n\nHM “I see...MAKE IT RAIN!!!”  He then hangs up. \n\nHe calls back a few seconds latter and tells me to send him a file of the recording.  He is going to have a conference call with Head of Security.  They have know each other since they were teens.  \n\nThe next day I come in to a surprising large amount of emails.  All about event requests the normals stuff. \n\nThe very last email I got was an email from Head of Security cc’d with HM.    He apologized, for having to deal with that situation.  Thanked me for compiling with BD until I was able to get things straighten out.  \n\nBD has been terminated the day prior after the voice recording was listened to.  \n\nI was also given full ability to run the building.  The only person I answer to is Head of Security.  Kinda a small promotion.\n\nTL:DRGuy threatens to fire me if I don’t do as he says.  Clearly violating policies.  Only to find himself fired instead. \n\n\nEdit: grammar, spelling. \n\n  ",

        "text": "So I work at a hospital in nutrition services, and one of my many jobs there is to serve food to people on the fifth floor sub acute rehabilitation floor in the adjoining rehab building. \n\nWe had this one patient who was very picky and always ordered off the menu meaning the cooks in the kitchen-which is on the second floor, and we bring the food up from there to serve-have to special make his order every time. This wouldn't be a big deal if he weren't such a jerk. \n\nOne time he went so far as to throw his food at a nurse because it wasn't made right. This guy has been there for a while and has always given his caregivers and the servers and cooks a hard time. He also would often order his dinner at the last second, and, because it's off the menu and not the food we would already have on the floor, the cooks would have to stay late to make it.\n\nSo the cooks became maliciously compliant. When he'd order a personal pizza \"burnt,\" instead of cooking it for the usual one minute, they'd put it in for seven. One time he ordered a wrap with the sauce put on which we usually don't do-we just put it on the side-so the cook put on so much it was dripping out of the wrap.\n\nThankfully he transferred floors and we don't have to deal with him anymore because he was such a pain. \n\nEdit to clarify:\n\n1. This guys wasn't upset about being in the hospital. He in fact never made any effort to improve or work with his physical therapists. He has no psychological issues. He was a dick since he got here and from what I heard before that.\n\n2. He wasn't supposed to order off the menu like that. The most that would happen is he'd be inconvenienced and have to ask for something else. The cooks did comply at first but got sick of it and of him making them stay late.\n\n3. Also he would bring his gf who would steal his meds and she never got kicked out \n",

So I shrug, get back in the car, and put it in reverse while holding the brake down. I text my wife and let her know that she'll need to take our kid in to the mechanic to drop the car off, then wait for her, which takes maybe three minutes.

        "text": "This week we got a new printer in the office and because \"I don't have anything better to do\", it became my job to set it up. But this wasn't just your usual printer, it was a huge workstation printer that was as heavy and probably thrice as expensive as my car. Why we would ever need such a thing is beyond me, because no one is using paper in our office, but that is not going to be part of this tale.\n\nThen I went and set that beast up. It has about as many different settings as it's price in cent's so I fought for a day and then I was hopeful enough that I did everything right that I gave it free for everyone to use. After a few minutes, one of my colleagues comes to my desk holding a piece of paper in her hand that said scan protocol. I was shocked because I knew that I set the setting to only print such a piece of paper when something is wrong.\n\nSo I take the printout and it says scan successful at the top. And what is the first reaction when something you are sure you did right isn't working as it is supposed to be? So I went back to the machine and went through all the settings while my self doubt was eating me from inside. When I checked everything and I found all the settings to be correct, I did the next logic thing and went to google, only to find nothing. There was no information on this problem anywhere online.\n\nFrustrated and tired, I called the support. After a measly one hour waiting music that only was pleasantly divided by a voice that told me every 10 seconds that the next specialist is reserved for me, I finally got to talk to an agent. We then went through all the settings together and we found that I did everything correctly. He then told me that he would send me a special firmware update. I was supposed to install that and then call back. I asked him how long it would take to install and when he told me that it would only take 2 minutes I asked some random questions while I installed it in the background so I wouldn't have to spend another hour in that queue, because I would rather bang my head against a wall for an hour than to listen to that again.\n\nAfter a surprised sound from the agent, when he realised that I tricked him, we went through the settings again, and surprise, it didn't work. He then told me that he would like to escalate the issue. I was supposed to send him the content of a settings overview page in the webinterface of the printer. He told me to just print the page but that was not possible as some genius had put the output in a js field that you could only copy the raw text out of.\n\nI put that text in a [normal text file ](https://imgur.com/a/5kX1L0C)so it was easy to read and then send it on to it's way. A few seconds later I get an call and he tells me that I would have to send the contents of the website as a pdf file. I explained to him that there was no way I could send the website as a pdf file but he insisted because he would have to send the file to his boss and he would only accept pdf files. We talked for a while and he told me that his boss was a douchebag that forced useless rules on them. I then just renamed my txt file to html (which obviously resulted in a mess) and then wrote a quick script that would screenshot the whole website page by page and save the contents as screenshots in a pdf file.\n\nThen I sent him a 1200 page long pdf file that mostly looked [like this](https://imgur.com/a/1MtqJCX). A few seconds later I got an email that only said thank you.\n\nAftermath: A few days later I got an email that said that they would exchange the device and they even copied the settings over for me. Now we can scan on our small car as much as we want.\n\nEDIT: removed some IP-Stuff",

Let me know if this doesn't really \"count\" as malicious compliance.\n\nI have a relatively rare chronic medical condition, and have seen countless doctors of a variety of specialties. I usually spend about 1-2 hours on the first visit just explaining what my medical condition is, as very few doctors have ever heard of it. I try to keep the explanations as brief as possible to avoid taking up more time than they expected, but it still takes a while, especially when doctors assume I'm exaggerating.\n\nThey usually start writing down my symptoms, one of which is nonstop joint pain in every single one of my joints. I often am asked to specify *which* joints, (as surely it couldn't really be all of them, right?) and it usually goes like this:\n\nDoctor (writing): Which joints exactly hurt?\n\nMe: All of them. Literally, every one of them.\n\nDoctor: Okay, but which ones specifically?\n\nMe: All the joints in all of my toes, the joints in my feet, my ankles, my knees, my hips, all of the joints in my spine, my sternum, my shoulders, my elbows, my wrists, the joints in my hands, all the joints in all of my fingers, and my neck.\n\nDoctor (who has given up writing down a list of joints): Oh.

        "text": "This is a story I've dredged up from my childhood memories over 15 years ago. TL;DR at the bottom. \n\nThe story begins with two young impossibly blonde kids living in the suburbs of Johannesburg South Africa. My sister and I are a year and a half apart which means we fought like dogs growing up but now we get along like a house on fire. I was about 8 and my sister was about 6, our parents had been divorced since I was age 3 and my mother, who we lived with, worked in advertising. This meant a couple of things; the first being the exceptionally long hours my mother had to work. When you sell your soul to the ad industry, you're sort of expected to forget you have kids as you slowly blink away the unendingly long hours behind your computer screen. She would often leave before we woke and not get home until 10-12 at night. This meant that my sister and I had a lot of time together and a lot of time to play and then subsequently fight.\n\nNow earlier my sister and i had decided to raid the freezer for the last 2 scoops of chocolate icecream. We definitely weren't allowed to do this but hey when the cat is away, the mice will play. We argued over who should dish up (and probably take the blame), she lost ching chong cha so off she went. Only to return with 2 bowls of icecream, watching me intently as i take my first bite as she wolfs down her portion as quickly as possible. That sweet sweet treat hits my lips. Only it's probably the saltiest thing I've ever had in my life. Spitting and gagging ensue, peppered with the malicious cackle of my sister in the background. I vowed to take revenge. \n\nQueue the MC. My sister and I decided it was a good idea to swing each other around by holding one arm and one leg and then spinning around in circles. You know the drill, much dizziness and much excited squealing. You know, at least usually. We also decide it's a good idea to do this in my mom's bedroom as there's a lot of spare floor space but definitely not more than outside so who knows where the logic went. \n\nSuddenly, it's my sister's turn. I build up momentum, much laughing is heard. Faster and faster I go until finally she's screaming, but i don't stop. Eventually she simply yells \"LET ME GO!\"\n\nSo I complied. \n\nShe went careening away from me, face first into the solid wood base of my mother's bed.\n\nHer nose began to bleed profusely and I begin to panic, begging her not to tell mom as if she wasn't going to notice the black eyes and blood spots on her floor.\n\nTLDR: My sister salt poisoned the last scoop of icecream, so when I was swinging her around by her hands and feet and she screamed \"let me go!\", I did. This sent her flying into the base of a bed and broke her nose. \n\nThis may be more petty revenge than malicious compliance but I feel I definitely followed her instructions to the letter. \n",

        "text": "I’ll keep this story short, partially because I’m trying my best to remember details from a while ago.\n\nBack in my high school math class, I had a teacher who dealt with a student so perfectly that I still remember it to this day.  She was returning our homework assignments to us after grading them.  After she was done passing them out, I noticed somebody go up to her desk on the other side of the room.  After piecing together a few of the details that I was able to overhear, it became apparent that this student received 4/5 and his friend received a 4.5/5 although they did every problem the same way.  The student with the lower grade was visibly upset by our teacher’s inconsistency.  He begged the teacher to give him the same grade as his friend.\n\nThe teacher, pouncing on the opportunity to maliciously comply to his request, swiftly lowered his friend’s grade to a 4/5 as well.  By now, most of the class had figured out what was going on.  Not only had the student been forced to admit to the teacher that he copied another student’s homework, he lost a friend and embarrassed himself in front of the entire class.  But the teacher did exactly what he asked and made their grades the same.\n\nIt was hard to contain my laughter as this *high school* student began to break down and started bawling in front of the class.  It got so bad that the teacher had to ask him to leave the room, and he did not return from the bathroom for roughly 15 minutes after the incident.  It was the greatest moment of justice served that I’ve ever had the pleasure of witnessing, and I believe it was completely deserved for the cheating student.  The best part is that he caused his own problems, and the teacher simply complied with his requests!\n\nTLDR: Student cheats on homework and gets different grade than friend.  Begs teacher to change his grade, but gets his friend’s grade lowered instead.  Student has an emotional breakdown in front of class from embarrassment.",

The people checked in, we received their suit cases, the people checked out.\n\nThe problem is that they didn't tell anybody about their incoming stuff, they were only one night with us and we got the suit cases while the A/C in the whole house was down when it was crazy hot in Europe.\nEnd of the story: Nobody called them. They didn't asked for their stuff.\n\nI called the number from their reservation, told the guy on the other line what happened and asked for an email from him to clear the situation. He told me that he didn't expect the luggage in our hotel and thought the transfer company will send everything to his follow stay in another country. I was helpful and friendly but everything what I got as mail was: \"Your Hotel has made this mistake, you will pay for the transfer. Just send everything to my address in ....\"\n\nNow, I took it personally. My purpose was to help him and not to be blamed for his incompetence of organizing his luggage service.\nSo, I called the company, told them the story which immediately started to send a guy to us.\nWhen he arrived I asked him what will happen with the luggage and he told me that he will bring it to the airport in the lost and found department. \n\nLet me say that it was very enjoyable to write an email and to inform this guest that we just followed the instructions of the company and that he had signed these policies which gave me the right to send everything back and he is now responsible to get his suit case in another country at the airport in the fucking lost and found department. \n\nJust don't be a dick when someone is trying to help you. Now you can call a dead or an overheated line to find someone which guide you through the \"found process\" and pay for it. \n\n",

She's pretty much the first point of contact for us lowly production employees and handles a lot of smaller, day to day stuff for the company.  \n**G**: The \"engineer\" in charge of one of the production departments. He mostly just walks around and complains.\n\nSo where I work, they try to do little things here and there to increase morale. One such thing is giving an employee a card and a candy bar on their birthday. It's not really a big deal but hey, who am I to pass up free chocolate?\n\nAnyways, G is a notorious complainer. This guy can find a problem with anything and one particular day his issue was with these candy bars that get passed out. In his infinite frustration, he sought out B and told her that he didn't want to give them out anymore because it was a waste of money and a stupid idea. B made note of his objections and I'm told it eventually got brought up in a meeting but G's boss said they were going to continue because, seriously, who doesn't like free candy? G reiterated that he didn't want it to continue, but he's not in charge so tough luck.\n\nSo G moves on to something else. Maybe someone forgot to sweep that one corner of the plant no one ever goes in. Maybe a toilet paper roll was left empty. I don't know. I can only say for certain that he wasn't bothering me and I'm thankful. Anyways, a couple months go by and guess who's birthday it is? G comes in and sits down at his desk and notices there's no candy bar, just a card. Around lunch time, confident that there had been some mistake, he goes to B and asks her, in a slightly more polite way, \"What the hell?\" B goes on to explain to him that he said he didn't want them handed out, and she didn't want to upset him by giving him a candy bar that, for some reason, he was so against. G goes on to throw a small fit over the chocolate that is now not only wanted, but completely necessary for him to enjoy his birthday. B apologizes, but she's got work to do and doesn't have time to go get him one so, again, tough luck. G leaves B's office, his birthday obviously ruined, and returned to \"work.\"\n\nTL;DR- Petty guy doesn't want others to enjoy their birthday candy, campaigns against it, but complains when he doesn't get his.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/96lusx/you_want_me_to_drive_a_34ton_mixer_over_a_sand/",
        "text": "Concrete mixers are unwieldy, top-heavy and spend a lot of time driving off-road with a shifting load.  Consequently, we tend try to pay a lot of attention to what we are driving on and where the customer wants us to go.  What the customer wants and what we are physically able to do don't always meet.  \n  \nThe jobsite I am working is down near the Salton Sea.  For those unfamiliar with Southern California history and geography, the Salton Sea is what happens when a man from Flint, Michigan hires a Canadian shipwright to dig a 60-mile irrigation canal, then digs a couple illegal bypass channels right before one of the worse flood in the recorded history of the Colorado River.  It has no outlet, and it currently a fetid lake of salt, stink and tilapia.  \n  \nThe customer, who we will call Pauly, is building three greenhouses on sandy ground.  The job mainly consists of chute pouring post holes for the steel supports.  It's slow work that isn't helped by being next to the Bog of Eternal Stench, in one of the hottest and most humid parts of the state.  The lot is clearly blow sand, the really fine stuff that gets carried by the wind.  It's been graded smooth, but not compacted at all; basically, the lot is a sand dune with pretensions of civilization, and even the balloon tires on the tractors are digging in.  I'm not taking my pig of a truck anywhere near that sand...at least not unless I wind up in a really foul mood.  \n  \nLuckily, the subcontractor is not stupid.  He looks at the situation and decides to have me pour into the [skip loader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_\\(equipment\\)#/media/File:Liugong_ZL50A_in_Guilin_East_Railway_Station_20100713_02.jpg) from the road.  He knows we can't move my truck across that sand, so he's been having the loader ferry the concrete from my truck to the holes.  It means that his crew has to shovel the concrete out by hand, and after the first couple loads, they are going to look like the chain gang from *Cool Hand Luke* (without the benefit of Joy Harmon), but since the owner didn't want to spring for a pump, it is the best option available. \n  \nPauly doesn't show up until a couple days into the job.  When I pull up with my load, he tells me that what we've been doing is taking too long.  He's got a different plan, a better plan.  He wants me to back out over the dirt to pour the holes directly, because clearly that thought never occurred to us.  When I try to explain that the ground is too soft, he point at the tire tracks through the sand and say, \"The last truck made it just fine.\"  This is a lie.  Not only that, it is an obvious lie.\n  \n\"The last truck made it,\" is one of the more common lies people tell drivers, right up there with, \"we can refill your tank with the water truck.\"  They are practically memes, similar to the jokes about inspectors being the enemy, just without the humor or benign intent...it's the difference between Al Bundy and Ted Bundy.  \n  \nI know I am being lied to, and what's worse, I'm being lied to incompetently.  For starters, the tire tracks Pauly's pointing at were clearly made by the loader, not a truck.  Also, I was the last truck.  The way the job has been going, they've had one truck come out, pour the load, then go back for the next one while the crew sets and aligns the posts in the holes.  Pauly doesn't know this because he got there while I was off getting the next load.  In fact, since this is his first time out here since we started, he has no clue that I am the only driver that has been on this job since it started.  This is one of those areas that doesn't bother with foppish fripperies, like street signs or addresses.  On top of that, this job is on a [flag lot](http://sanjoserealestatelosgatoshomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/flaglotjpg.jpg), so it has a very narrow street facing.  I was on the job the first day, and since, after that, I knew where it was (and he knew I wouldn't say no), my manager, Bob, asked me to do it on subsequent days, so he wouldn't have to deal with lost drivers.  So Pauly is a bad liar and  I am now in a really foul mood.  \n  \nWith my most obsequious smile, I say, \"Oh, well in that case, of course.  I just need you to sign the ticket before I can pull onto the property.\"  On my way back to the cab, I call Bob to see what else we have going that day.  There isn't much other work, so Bob asks what's going on.  I explain the situation, and Bob just asks one question, \"Did he sign the ticket?\"  When I say yes, he tells me to be careful and call him if we need a wrecker.  \n  \nIf you ever order concrete, yourself, and the driver refuses to pour without you signing the ticket first, think long and hard about what you just asked him to do.  The ticket includes a damage waiver and acknowledges receipt of the concrete.  Some drivers may have you sign it as a matter of course (though I've never met one, and most of the guys I know don't even get signatures after the job).  For the most part, however, it should be viewed as a giant red flag that the driver think there is some kind of liability in play.  It could be something as simple as backing up a curb (which could crack) or front yard (with ever so crushable irrigation pipes and septic tanks).  It could also mean that you've really torqued off the driver, and he's about to nail you on standby time (you have a limited amount of time to unload before the accounting trolls start charging you a buck or two every minute).  Your best bet is to ask them if there is something to be concerned about.  Technically you could refuse to sign, but by that point its a Hobson's choice, and if there is nothing wrong with the load, you are paying for it either way.  \n  \nIf we were busy, I would have slowly backed up until my truck started to bog down, then pulled forward and refused to go any further.  We aren't busy; when I bog down, I just pull forward and try again.  Each time I get a little further back, but it is very slow going.  Pauly is getting upset.  After half a dozen attempts, Pauly starts waving me back furiously and shouts, \"Step on it.  Just get on top of it!\"  Apparently Pauly thinks I'm on a boat.  But, in the world of Malicious Compliance, the customer is always right.  I pull forward as far as I can, floor it in reverse, and right before I hit the sand, I flip the selector up and stick it into high range.  \n  \nA manual truck transmission is laid out in a standard H pattern, but each position covers two or three gears.  There are selector switches to choose which sets of gears you are using.  For instance, on an 8 speed, low range is 1-4, high range is 5-8.  While high-range reverse is a usable gear, you will almost never see a driver using it.  Even the manufacturers recommend against attempting it (it's a fiddly gear that is easy to break if you hit it with too much power), and you rarely need to go anywhere near that fast in reverse.  \n  \nMy truck leaps onto that sand like a corpulent gazelle, huffing and wheezing across the veldt.  It doesn't last long.  I've barely made it a truck length before I have to go back down to low range.  Not long after that, my wheels start slinging dirt, the tires sink in, and the truck starts bouncing from the effort.  That's the signal to stop and check my work.  Pauly is, of course, not happy with this.  My truck is nowhere near close enough.  He looks at me, and to my complete and utter lack of surprise asks, \"What happened?\"  I tell him that I appear to be stuck.  He asks if I can pull forward and try again.  I look at my tires.  The truck is buried to the axles, and it weighs as much as 13 pickup trucks (or 40 Smart Cars); nothing short of divine intervention is moving that truck while it is still full.  \n  \nSo I smile and say, I'll give it a shot.  On the side of my stick is a little knob for something called deep reduction.  You set that knob and put it into low, and that engine turns into the God of Torque (for you gear heads out there, the ratio is somewhere around 27:1).  It's practically impossible to stall the engine in that gear without running into an immovable object.  Even then, you are just as likely to snap your axle or tear out the drive train, while the engine hums merrily along.  And, of course, if you are on soft, loose sand, it will just kick a gloriously wicked rooster tail all over anything (or anyone) behind you.  Pauly is still spitting dirt when I get out to give him the bad news.  Looks like we are going to have to keep using the loader, like we were.  Then once we've finished with that, he can use the it to help pull my truck out of the dirt (in the end, we had the loader pulling on my tow hook, and an excavator pushing on the Mansfield bar).  Not only did it waste half an hour of the precious time he was trying to save, but he had to pay around $50 worth of standby (of course it could have been worse; if I'd been truly stuck, he would have been on the hook for the wrecker).  \n  \nTL/DR:  Impatient customer lies about previous trucks making across impassible terrain.  I try crossing it, getting my truck magnificently stuck, delaying his job even further, showering him with sand and charging him for the privilege.",
