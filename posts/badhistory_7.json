        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers! Truly it has been a long time since my last submission. A combination of full-time work, rewriting my RPG from scratch and a variety of other concerns have kept me from turning my attention to any further reviews. Until today! As such, I am continuing my analysis of War and Civilization – Episode One – First Blood: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFvSNptJAcA\n\nWith me is a bottle of Mead I received for Christmas, so let us begin!\n\n27:32: WARNING! SPARTAN WANK APPROACHES!\n\n27.43: \"A Persian was sent on horseback to observe what the troops were doing. Some of them were stripped for exercise, while others were combing their hair.\" Maybe the Spartans were born with it. Maybe it was Maybelline.\n\n30.33: \"Themistocles gave the order and the Athenians rowed hard towards the Persians.\" Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe.\n\n31.56: The narrator says that seeking a decisive engagement on carefully chosen ground was a Greek tactic. Ummmmm, no. States such as the Hittites and Egyptians would choose to battle on terrain such as plains, where the efficiency of their chariot forces could be maximized. The Assyrians also focused on bringing their opponents to battle in a way that could be called 'decisive', as there are frequent accounts to the Assyrians defeating their enemies in the field. These include the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC, which is described as having up to 50,000 men on each side. This represents a huge investment in terms of manpower and resources, which translates to a desire to have the capacity of the opponent to wage war totally obliterated. DRINK!\n\n32.08: \"The Greek way of war seemed poised to take over the world\". In 480 BC? Ummmmm, no. The Greeks were still heavily divided, and even together could not match the manpower, income or resources available to the Achaemenids. The Greeks did not even have a standing army at this point, and their capacity to engage in large-scale sieges was neglible. I also don't recall Greek armies conquering Europe, China, Wakanda, Greater India, North Africa or the steppes. DRINK!\n\n33.25: This man has a British accent. This makes him a credible source.\n\n33.27: The Narrator says Phillip of Macedon created a new type of army. If he is talking about a professional, full-time force, he was beaten to the punch several thousand years earlier by Sargon. If the narrator is talking about the use of sarissa, there is artwork of Bronze Age soldiers using long spears in an organized manner from Akrotiri in Greece. Either way, DRINK!\n\n33.34: GREEK INFANTRY FETISHIZATION! DRINK!\n\n34.38: The narrator says that Phillip placed the Macedonian phalanx at the heart of his own army. This is wrong. The Macedonian phalanx was only one aspect of a combined-arms force. It was not the sole battle-winning tactic. DRINK!\n\n34.56: \"The nobles of the north were exceptional horsemen. Phillip took these men and turned them into cavalry\". So he got horse-riding warriors and made them horse-riding warriors?\n\n37.04: Don't they know that if they double-click the soldiers will march faster?\n\n38.05: \"Phillip revolutionized warfare not only because of the way he taught his troops to fight, he also paid them and trained them all year round\". *AUTISTIC SCREECHING*\n\n40.00: Is it me or does Alexander the Great look like Judge Dredd?\n\n40.08: \"Bad news, we ran out of props for the extras\". \"Just give the last guy a helmet made of cardboard and film it in black and white. No one will notice\".\n\n41:40: \"True to their word, the Sacred Band had fought side by side to the death.\" Their sacrifice was both inspiring and *fabulous*.\n\n45.19: \"No one had ever tackled the problem of feeding and supplying an army so far from home.\" Nope. Certainly not Cyrus, who campaigned in Thrace and the region north of the Black Sea. Or Xerxes, who brought a large fleet and army to Greece itself. Or the Assyrians, who conquered parts of Anatolia and Egypt. DRINK!\n\n45.26: Alexander's genius was to be both a great fighter and the father of modern logistics.\" Lol wut? I think the Assyrians creating large standing army that campaigned throughout the year in diverse environments was more significant in terms of logisitical innovation, given that the scale of what they did was unprecedented. Additionally, as Alexander kept of lot of Achaemenid officials and governmental structures in place, he was merely making use of pre-existing infrastructure and supplies, rather than creating a new system from scratch. DRINK!\n\n45.46: \"If Alexander caught them using ox-carts to carry food or equipment he would burn the cart and slaughter the ox.\" Well, he wasn't called Alexander the Reasonable.\n\n47.46: Gah! The narrator is still insisting Alexander marched his troops farther from home than any army before. The Achaemenids campaign just as extensively in terms of distance, and it was because of them that Alexander was even able to advanced as far as he did! DRINK!\n\n49.21: \"In the entire history of warfare, no man has matched the achievements of Alexander the Great.\" I would characterize Cyrus as being one who outmatched Alexander. He conquered a similar amount of territory, but more importantly the foundations of the empire he created continued after his death, which is something Alexander cannot claim. Alexander also relied on an army and tactical system built by his father, and was not really as innovative as he was reckless.\n\nAnd that is it for now!\n\nSources\n\nThe Ancient Celts, by Barry Cunliffe\n\nAncient Persia: A Concise History of the Achaemenid Empire, 550-330 BCE, by Matt Waters\n\nBy the Spear: Philip II, Alexander the Great, and the Rise and Fall of the Macedonian Empire, by Ian Worthington\n\nThe Histories, Volume Two, by Herodotus: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2456/2456-h/2456-h.htm\n\nA History of the Ancient Near East, by Marc Van de Meiroop\n\nShadows in the Desert – Ancient Persia at War, by Kaveh Farrokh\n\nA Storm of Spears, by Christopher Matthew\n\nWarfare in the Ancient Near East to 1600 BC, by William Hamblin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "title": "Prager U doesn't understand the Korean War",
        "author": "mscott734",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7xr40s/prager_u_doesnt_understand_the_korean_war/",
        "text": "Hello fellow historians! Today I will be examining a video on the Korean War from everyone’s favorite propagandists; the folks over at PragerU. [Link to video here for those of you who want to follow along] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t44SbOyjEUM&amp;list=PLIBtb_NuIJ1xS4y2x3jS2dpnpuLwokgtS&amp;index=15 ) There are a few good posts in the sub dissecting some of Prager’s videos but for those of you unfamiliar with them they are a conservative non-profit digital media organization that makes short, inaccurate videos to back up their views on politics, religion, economics, and history. Some of you may know them as Prager University, which is what they prefer to be called, but as they do not have any degree programs, let alone the two doctorate degree programs necessary to be called a university, they aren’t allowed to actually use that name so neither will I. In this video PragerU tries to peddle some facts about the Korean War which aren’t quite true. With that out of the way let’s look at Prager U’s video “Why did America fight the Korean War”.\n\n\n(0:46)- Right off the bat, this map makes no sense in what it is showing. [In case you aren’t watching along with the video here’s the map] (https://imgur.com/K02qKDa) . So supposedly the Soviet Union is in Dark red and the orange is I guess supposed to be the expansion of communism? Except for the fact that in the dark red section is Mongolia, which was communist but was also an independent nation and not one of the Soviet Socialist Republics. So the logical conclusion is that the dark red is the area where communists controlled and not just the Soviet Union. But this also makes no sense as Poland, Romania, East Germany, China, and north Korea are all initially colored white instead of dark red. The orange also can’t represent areas that communists would conquer because by the time the map fades the orange has expanded all the way South to the Northern coast of Turkey as well as the entirety of Korea and Japan. And while those three regions are shown to be too communist in this interpretation of the map China is definitely undershaded as only Dongbei, Xinjiang, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, and the Eastern Seaboard are shaded orange but by the time the Korean war happened mainland China had been unified under the People’s Republic of China so the entirety of China should be red and not just those regions. But then there’s the problem that the map is shown after the speaker says “expansionist threat of Soviet Russia” which either means that the map is meant to show the territorial ambitions of the Soviet Union, which doesn’t make sense because I’ve never seen any evidence of the Soviets attempting to annex Chinese territory as far South as Shanghai, or it means that these are areas where the Soviet Union means to spread communism in which case it’s wrong because there should be more areas shaded red. So yeah no matter how you look at it this map is wrong and makes no sense.\n\n\n(0:58)-The Soviets didn’t encourage the North’s aggression as PragerU claims. It was Kim Il Sung who was the primary mover and shaker behind North Korea’s invasion. Stalin only gave his tentative approval for the invasion and Mao wanted to complete his reunification of China by taking Taiwan and wasn’t enthusiastic about having his army being North Korea's backup. Mao only agreed because Kim lied, saying Stalin was enthusiastically supportive of his planned invasion of the South when really the Soviet Union was thoroughly unenthusiastic about the upcoming invasion. At that time China was in sore need of Soviet economic assistance so Mao agreed to support Kim in order to curry favor with Stalin. The Soviets even refused to aid the North Koreans in their war with Stalin supposedly telling Kim “If you should get kicked in the teeth, I shall not lift a finger to help you. You have to ask Mao for all the help.”\n\n\n(1:26)-The Chinese Red Army was renamed the People’s Liberation Army in 1945 after the end of the 2nd Sino-Japanese war. Thus, using the term “Chinese Red Army” in the context of the Korean War is inaccurate.\n\n\n(1:56)- Seoul only changed hands four times throughout the course of the korean war and not five like the video claims. The first time was after the First Battle of Seoul in June of 1950 when the North Koreans captured the city. The second time was after the Second Battle of Seoul in September of the same year when UN forces recaptured the city. Then in January of 1951 the Chinese captured the city following the Third Battle of Seoul and finally in March of 1951 the Fourth Battle of Seoul would take place and UN forces would recapture Seoul for the final time in the war. There would be another attempt by the Communists to take the city but it would be unsuccessful and therefore wouldn’t count as the city having changed hands.\n\n\n(4:06)- I’d say that attributing the entire victory in the Cold War to the U.S. pursuing a containment strategy is both overvaluing the containment strategy as well as undervaluing larger cultural and economic factors affecting The Soviet Union. Also the Soviet Union didn’t collapse in 1989, it collapsed in 1991. You could say that the Iron Curtain fell in 1989 with the Revolutions of 1989 and the Soviets lost the Cold War, but that’s not really the same thing as the Soviet Union collapsing.\n\n\n(4:26)- I’m not sure I’d call South Korea pre 1980 free, as the video is claiming. Syngman Rhee was basically a dictator and committed various massacres against his own citizens, murdered political opponents, rigged elections, and overall his regime was oppressive and cruel. South Korea could be called free during the Second Republic after Rhee was ousted in the April Revolution, but the Second Republic only lasted one year before it was overthrown in a military coup. The Third Republic that followed was initially not too repressive but quickly became so the longer Park Chung-Hee was president and by the time 1972 rolled around he had become a full blown autocrat. The Fourth Republic began in 1972 with the passing of the Yusin Constitution, which gave President Park immense power and really cemented his position as dictator. It wouldn’t be until the Fifth Republic was declared, after the assassination of Park, that I’d be willing to call South Korea a free nation. I don’t doubt that many of the soldiers fighting in the Korean war on the South’s side believed they were fighting for a free Korea, but with the benefit of hindsight it’s dishonest for PragerU to try and frame the Korean War as Free vs Unfree knowing as we do that South Korea was more or less a dictatorship for most of its history prior to 1980. It would be more accurate for PragerU to say that the United States fought in the Korean War to protect the American Sphere of influence and try to stop the expansion of the Soviet sphere of influence. Also if the United States really wanted to “keep at least half of the Korean people free” as the video claims, they wouldn’t have supported the dictatorial regimes of Rhee and Park.\n\n\nAnd with that I’m done with analyzing this video. I’m sure there’s some stuff in the video that’s wrong and I overlooked but these were the errors that I was able to pick out. Overall the video is just bad. It tries to make the Korean War into something that it just wasn’t and attempts to portray American motivations for getting involved in Korea as far more noble and selfless than they actually were and the most depressing thing about that isn’t that that’s their motivation, (as most of Prager’s history videos only serve to romanticize American history) but that they couldn’t even be asked to double check basic facts regarding the subject of their own video. It’s just terrible. So with that I’ll end this post, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed doing writing and doing research for this post, and I hope you have a wonderful day!\n\n\nSources:\n\n-Sandler, Stanley.

        "author": "Ascocarp",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7xpck4/roman_triumphs_over_sardinians/",
        "text": "So I've found out about a thread on Roman Sardinia on Reddit ask historians called \"What happened during the Roman conquest of Sardinia and Corsica?\" and I've noticed that it's filled with inaccurate or outright wrong information, what this poster stated for instance is false\n\n\"As for artistic depictions, I doubt it. We would really only expect to see this on triumphal art, and the Sardinians were viewed as uncivilized bandits, not to sort to hold a triumph over.\"\n\nRomans actually celebrated a huge number of triumphs over the Sardinians, to be precise they celebrated 7 triumphs over the Sardinians and 2 over the Sardinians and Carthaginians, source: http://www.veniteadme.org/wp-content/uploads/Storia-della-Sardegna-antica.pdf\n\n\nHe denied that the Romans held triumphs against the Sardinians because they didn't regard them as worthy of celebrating with a triumph, however this isn't true at all since Romans celebrated several triumphs over them instead:\n\nThe first triumph to be held against the Sardinians alone (and not the allied Sardinians and Carthaginians) was granted to the consul Titus Manlius Torquatus for a victory over the Sardinians who rebelled against the Roman rule, the triumph was awarded to him on the 11th of March, 234 bc. The following year consul Spurius Carvilius Maximus was given the honor of celebrating another triumph over the Sardinians in April, after suppressing another uprising. Consul Manius Pomponius Matho was given the honor of celebrating another triumph on the 15th of March 231 bc for having suppressed another rebellion.\n\nIn 177/176 BC, in order to suppress the rebellion of the Sardinian tribes known as the Balares and the Ilienses, the Senate sent the consul Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus to be in charge of two legions; each was composed of 5,200 foot soldiers and 300 knights, with another 1,200 infantrymen and 600 knights among allies and Latins. It is estimated that around 27,000 Sardinians lost their lives in this revolt (12,000 in 177 and 15,000 in 176); following the defeat, the tax burden was doubled on the islanders, and Gracchus obtained the triumph. Titus Livius reports the inscription on the temple of the goddess Mater Matuta, in Rome, where the winners exhibited a commemorative plaque that said: \"Under the command and the auspices of the consul Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, the legion and the army of the Roman people subjugated Sardinia. More than 80,000 enemies were killed or captured in the province. Conducting things in the happiest way for the Roman State, freeing the friends, restoring the income, he brought back the army safe and sound and rich in booty; for the second time he entered Rome triumphant. In memory of these events, he dedicated this panel to Jupiter.\"\n\nDuring the year 126 bc Lucius Aurelius Orestes quelled a series of Sardinian revolts and celebrated his victories with a triumph on the 8th of December 122 bc. Consul Marcus Caecilius Metelli stayed on Sardinia for 4 years starting from 115 bc and managed to suppress the violent rebellions of the Sardinians, so he was allowed to celebrate with a triumph during the month of July in 111 bc. Another triumph was held by the praetor Titus Albucius in 108 bc but it was a far lesser victory than the others.\n\nBefore these triumphs there were some held by the Romans against the Punics and Sardinians, the first one was held in honor of consul Publius Cornelius Scipio who won against the Carthaginians, Sardinians and Corsicans, Publius occupied Alalia in Corsica and probably Olbia in Sardinia, Hanno was killed at Olbia while fighting during 259 bc, Cornelius celebrated with a triumph the following year. After obtaining some victories over the Carthaginians and Sardinians, resulting in the death of Hannibal Gisco after the sea battle which took place near the sea of the city of Sulky in Sardinia, consul Gaius Sulpicius Patercolus celebrated a triumph on the 6th of October 258 bc for his victories over the Carthaginians and the Sardinians.\n\nEven disregarding the triumphs over the allied Carthaginians and Sardinians that's still seven triumph over the Sardinians alone, that's a lot considering Sardinia was only a small region, these facts disprove the claims made by Tiako. Not only that but one should take in account that the stereotype about the Sardinians being just poor thieves was that, a stereotype used by Cicero in an oration, \"Pro Scauro\", where he had to defend his client, accused of bad administration over the province of Sardinia by the Sardinians who accused him, the oration is full of hatred and racism and of course heavily biased. Not all ancient writers or Romans held a bad opinion of the Sardinians, for instance there was a long historical tradition which linked the Sardinians with noble peoples, according to many ancient historians such as Diodorus Sicilus the Sardinians originated from the Heraclids, the sons of Heracles, according to others they descended from the Trojans too.\n\nThis is of course not a personal attack, it is a really specific topic and the in depth sources are mostly in Italian, but I still wanted to clarify this for anyone that was interested, there are also some other imprecise statements he made so if you have any question about this topic ask away.\n\n",

        "text": "The word 'propaganda' is thrown around a lot these days, usually in relation to the news but sometimes in relation to history as well. This makes sense after all, history is what created our modern world and politics, and a lot of people will go to history to back up or prove a point.\n\nHowever, the problem with using history as a basis for modern politics is that it's easy to make a mistake or omit certain facts which paint a bigger picture of the events. After all, if you omitted key facts about a political situation that happened last week, people would call you out on it, because odds are they'd know a thing or two about what you're talking about. History, however, is a little more tricky. It's easier to drop some relevant info here and there to prove a point, because people won't know as much to call you out on it. The most obvious example of this is the myth that the Nazis were a left-wing party, with the inherent modern day implication being that left-wing politics have the potential to create a Nazi state, therefore we should stay away from all things left.\n\nThings get *really* tricky though when the propaganda revolves around a piece of history that many people don't know about. Lo and behold, [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZjFZjZBD78) published in early December of last year. It's by a small channel, and, as of time of writing, has just a little under 100,000 views. It's a short video too, just shy of 8 minutes, but the implications are clear, dangerous, and blatantly propagandistic. The video isn't badhistory in the technical sense of it pulling facts and figures directly out of some poor soul's unwilling ass, rather it misrepresents, omits, and skews the facts that are there to serve a modern day, racist narrative. It's not badhistory in facts, but badhistory in perspective.\n\nThe video is called \"A quick rundown of rhodesia\", and, as its title suggests, is a video explaining the history of Rhodesia, now modern day Zimbabwe, which existed from 1965-1979. Before we get to the video, I just wanna give my own 'quick rundown' on Rhodesia. \n\nI was never taught about Rhodesia, or, indeed, much African history in school. However, I did learn bits and pieces from my grandmother, who was a British colonial raised primarily in various British African colonies - and who to this day regularly visits Africa, primarily South Africa. She taught me all the general stuff other kids learn - Nelson Mandela, apartheid, all that jazz - but she also taught me about bits and moments that I might have otherwise never heard of. Things like the Suez Crisis, the formation of Somalia and, of course, Rhodesia.\n\nRhodesia was formed in 1965 after declaring independence from Britain. However, it was a racist state created primarily to [ensure white minority rule](http://www.zimembassy.se/history.html). It was eventually toppled in 1979 when elections were held, resulting in [Robert Mugabe taking power and forming the nation of Zimbabwe in 1980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJZGfipDewY)\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBut anyway, on to the video:\n\nRight off the bat the stage is set for a blatant, yet somewhat effective, propaganda video. The first 23 seconds of the video is an opening credit montage with the song \"Rhodesians Never Die\" by Clem Tholet playing in the background. While initially released as a pop song, \"Rhodesians Never Die\" eventually became popular as a patriotic song, due to the presence of lyrics such as:\n\n&gt; We'll keep our land a free land /\n&gt; Stop the enemy coming in /\n&gt; We'll keep them north of the Zambezi /\n&gt; 'Til that river's running dry\n\nNow, I don't think I need to explain the connotations of \"Keep *them* north of the Zambezi\" considering that the Zambezi acts as the northern border with Zambia, which accepted [black majority rule in 1964](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-14113084), a year before Rhodesia declared independence.\n\nThe use of this song - an upbeat, patriotic, yet implicitly racist pop song - sets the stage for the state and government of Rhodesia to be viewed in a certain light. Right after the opening credits is [an unedited interview with a white Rhodesian soldier](https://youtu.be/CZjFZjZBD78?t=23) in which the soldier justifies and defends the actions of the Rhodesian military as \"fighting to preserve a way of life, to maintain a home, to live in this country generally under what I consider to be an acceptable system... If the rest of Africa is an example of the alternatives to it... and if that is what Communism represents in general, I'm going to be against [it] until the day... I finally go.\"\n\nThis monologue is important for several reasons. First of all, it plays before any piece of information has been given about Rhodesia, so it sets the scene for Rhodesia to be viewed as a lonely, reluctant hero fighting not just the rest of Africa, but Communism itself. In short, it sets up Rhodesia in a positive light. Secondly, the mention of Communism is important, because it sets up the Bush War (which I'll be coming to shortly) as a fight against Communism, which is an acceptable cause in the eyes of many. Thirdly, and this is the most important aspect, only the white Rhodesian perspective is given, despite the fact that, according to *An introduction to the history of Central Africa* by Alfred John Wills, whites only made up 7% of Rhodesia's population by 1960. Interestingly, throughout Rhodesia's history, going back to its earliest days as an English colony, the white population was transient and unstable, with most white settlers leaving the country every year, and most of the white population growth resulting from *more* white immigrants coming in (again, Alfred John Mills)\n\nThe fact that only the white Rhodesian perspective is given foreshadows the entire video, which only examines the history of Rhodesia through a pro-Rhodesian lens. Now, the problem with this video, and indeed, the problem with any effective propaganda video, is that the facts themselves aren't actually wrong, but are portrayed in a slanted, isolated way that gives credence and rationality to a modern day political view which otherwise would have neither.\n\nGoing back to the content of the video itself, at 1:20, it announces that Rhodesia declared independence (UDI, Unilateral Declaration of Independence) from Britain on November 11th 1965. The narrator describes how \"UDI was announced contrary to the will of the British. This was in response to several unsuccessful attempts to persuade the British government to grant them independence of their own free will.\" If you think that description seems a little light on facts and details, that's because it is. In reality, the UDI was declared in retaliation to the [British colonial policy of \"No independence before majority (African) rule\" (NIBMAR)](https://books.google.ca/books?id=owvXW06nujsC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), a policy that ensured that successor states to British colonies in Africa would be ruled by the majority African populations, rather than the colonial white minorities. The video would have you believe that the British were acting imperialist and trying to quash descent, when in reality, they were trying to ensure that the colonial successors would at the very least act like democracies (and yes, I know that the British Empire isn't exactly known for being the nicest empire around, especially when it comes to Africa, so I will add that NIBMAR was actually drafted and suggested to Prime Minister Harold Wilson by Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson.)\n\nThe following thirty seconds consist of details about the economic sanctions Britain placed on Rhodesia, and how, despite all that, Rhodesia managed to have \"a balanced budget\" by finding \"strategic buyers\". I only point this out because it serves no purpose other than to continue the narrative of Rhodesia being a scrappy underdog taking on the world and being damn good at it.\n\nThe next thirty seconds detail the beginning of the Rhodesian Bush War, which would eventually end with the dissolution of Rhodesia and the formation of Zimbabwe. The narrator gives brief descriptions of the armed ZANU and ZAPU groups, the former of which was headed by Mugabe and backed by China and the latter backed by the Soviet Union. The narrator describes the first battle - the Battle of Sinoia, [also known as the Chinhoyi Battle](http://www.zimembassy.se/history.html) - at 2:54, saying \"Rhodesian forces killed seven members of ZANLA [the armed forces of ZANU] who crossed the Zambian border. The guerrillas, despite outnumbering Rhodesian forces and receiving arms from abroad, made little progress until the 1970s.\" \n\nNow, that quote in particular is so spectacularly misleading and propagandistic I'm honestly in awe. It's essentially stating two facts: 1) the first battle happened in 1966 and resulted in a ZANLA loss, with seven members killed, and 2) Rhodesia was outnumbered but held on for a long time against the guerrillas. However, the placement of the two statements back to back gives the impression that the Battle of Sinoia *and* the Bush War in general can be summed up as the scrappy Rhodesians charging on against the African forces despite overwhelming odds. What the narrator doesn't point out is that the Battle of Sinoia was quite the other way around.\n\nThe Battle of Sinoia can more accurately be called a massacre. When the narrator mentioned the battle resulted in the deaths of \"seven members of ZANLA\", he doesn't point out that those were the *only* ZANLA combatants during the battle. The battle itself pitted those seven members of ZANLA against **40** Rhodesian police officers - meaning ZANLA was outnumbered **5.7:1**. What the narrator also omits is that the ZANLA members were ambushed, the battle lasted a whole day, and the seven members of ZANLA held on suffering no casualties until the end of the day when they ran out of ammunition. The battle itself became somewhat of a Zimbabwean Alamo, inspiring Zimbabwean nationalists and guerrillas. Edgar Tekere, a high-ranking member of ZANU, noted in his memoir, *A Lifetime of Struggle* that imprisoned Zimbabwean nationalists \"went wild with joy\" upon hearing the story of the battle.\n\nNow, the obvious reason the narrator didn't go into the details of the Battle of Sinoia is because it goes against the narrative he's set up of an underdog Rhodesia fighting on against the forces of Africa, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, China, and Communism itself. Any form of effective propaganda has a narrative and makes sure to never stray from it.\n\nBefore we continue, I just want to point out a little tidbit not necessarily of badhistory but rather badgeography occurs at 3:40, when the narrator notes that \"In 1975, the hostile nations of Angola and Mozambique gained independence from pro-Rhodesian Portugal. So, along with Zambia, the guerrillas could set up bases and train in three countries bordering Rhodesia.\" This is true, and he's not leaving out any facts here, but he is forgetting the fact that Angola doesn't actually border Rhodesia (he even displays a map as he says this).\n\nAt 3:53, the narrator claims \"As *terrorist* guerrilla attacks [emphasis mine] targeting civilians and farmers became more frequent, Rhodesia mobilized the population and became more aggressive towards ZANU and ZAPU\" while the video displays gruesome images of the aftermath of the [Elim Mission Massacre](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/06/25/guerrillas-slay-12-at-rhodesian-mission-school/992870bc-2ce5-4f9c-9bb4-518d5578bf2c/?utm_term=.eb17377fe461), wherein ZANU members attacked and slaughtered, according to the Washington Post, \"eight British missionaries and four of their children\". The act was, obviously, horrific, and the narrator uses it perfectly to fit his narrative of the noble and reluctant Rhodesians soldiering on against the 'savage' Africans.\n\nHowever, if the video was at all interested in atrocities of war, then it would make sense to mention things like the Rhodesian military's use of chemical weapons. According to *Dirty War: Rhodesia and Chemical Biological Warfare, 1975–1980* by Glenn Cross, over 1,000 Zimbabweans were killed by Rhodesian chemical weapons, an act considered by many to be, [you know, a war crime.](https://unoda-web.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/assets/WMD/Bio/pdf/Status_Protocol.pdf) prohibited under the Geneva Protocol of 1925.\n\nInterstingly, the narrator does mention Operation Eland - otherwise known as the Nyadzonya raid - at 4:18, wherein 84 Rhodesian troops disguised themselves as ZANLA members (which is also defined as a war crime under the Geneva Protocol) and laid a trap at a ZANU camp, massacring anywhere between 1,000-2,000 ZANLA members according to *The Rhodesian War: A Military History*. However, the narrator, of course, omits all that detail and merely describes Operation Eland as a \"daring raid\" wherein Rhodesian troops \"killed thousands of guerrillas at their training camps, with virtually no Rhodesian casualties.\" I guess though, one man's war crime is another man's 'daring' and glorious raid.\n\nHonestly this obfuscation and one-sighted perspective goes on for the entire video, but I'm already getting tired writing all this up, so I'll just summarize most of the rest of the video as the narrator pointing out ZANU and ZAPU atrocities while disregarding or misrepresenting Rhodesian crimes. However, I want to cover two things before I finish.\n\nFirstly is the emphasis placed on Communism and the Communist backing of Zimbabwean guerrillas. While the backing of China and the Soviet Union was instrumental in the eventual victory for the guerrilla fighters, it also serves as a way to reframe the Rhodesian Bush War as a whole. By portraying the war as Rhodesia standing against Communism, the narrator and video make the Rhodesians seem palatable and moderate. After all, most Westerners are probably okay with the idea of fighting Communism - who wants to live in the Soviet Union after all? However, while the rebels were leftists and backed by Communist powers, they weren't fighting for Communism. They were fighting against a racist regime that ruled their country. But don't just take my word for it, UN Resolution 217 explicitly;\n\n&gt; *Condemns* [emphasis theirs] the usurpation of power by a racist settler minority in Southern Rhodesia and regards the declaration of independence by it as having no legal validity\n\nThe native Zimbabweans (who, I will remind you, made up over 90% of the population) just wanted majority rule. But, that runs counter to the narrative in the video, which brings me to the second thing I want to cover: the point of it all.\n\nAt 6:40 the video shows a succession of political cartoons, economic figures of modern Zimbabwe, and headlines about the corrupt regime of Robert Mugabe and the various racist acts made against the white population by it (which are somehow relevant to the history of Rhodesia, I guess?), ending the video with an \"inspirational\" quote by Ian Smith, the Premier of Rhodesia. The point here is clear: Rhodesia was powerful against all odds, awesome, successful, fair, and only went to war because the rest of the world hated it. Now everything's shit because the country's run by blacks and Communists. I would call it dogwhistling, but it seems a little more blatant than that. At least, to my ears anyway.\n\nWhat I worry is that someone will approach this video with next to no knowledge of Rhodesia, a person who didn't have a figure like my grandmother growing up, and will begin to sympathize with the Rhodesian regime, which might in turn open them up to more heinous modern ideologies, maybe even explicit racism in the end. No doubt that's the point of the video, considering it's light on the buzzwords and is factually correct - that bit about the Angola border notwithstanding. \n\nThat's why I'm glad places like this sub exist. It can serve as a way to stop that radicalization process. I know I sound a bit preachy now, but it's places like r/badhistory that keep young kids who don't know any better from being radicalized by a few well-made, flashy, propaganda videos.\n\nEdit: Grammar, formatting, removed some clunky words, general stylistic stuff.",

Progressives of the 18th century were the French radicals and labor unionists. The people fight for minimum wages, weekends, and socialist things.\n\n&gt;America progressive and utopians were often religious cults who’s eugenics would go on to form the basis of the fascist movement in Europe. It was little white supremacy, social Darwinism which Darwin himself opposed.\n\n**Rule #5**: No such term was applied to 18th century radicals. The application of this term to politics is usually attributed to either Hegel (1807)'s progressive theory of history, or Mill (1859)'s notion of man as a \"progressive being\".\n\nFurthermore, the factory system became possible only in the early 19th century, after the invention of interchangeable parts (1803). Movements for minimum wage and weekend laws grew out of the prevalent use of the factory system in the 1840s in England, then later in other European countries. Engels summarized this neatly in a 1892 preface to his 1845 work, The Condition of the Working Class in England:\n\n&gt;But while England has thus outgrown the juvenile state of capitalist exploitation described by me, other countries have only just attained it. France, Germany and especially America, are the formidable competitors who, at this moment – as foreseen by me in 1844 – are more and more breaking up England's industrial monopoly. Their manufactures are young as compared with those of England, but increasing at a far more rapid rate than the latter; and, curious enough, they have at this moment arrived at about the same phase of development as English manufacture in 1844. With regard to America, the parallel is indeed most striking. True, the external surroundings in which the working class is placed in America are very different, but the same economical laws are at work, and the results, if not identical in every respect, must still be of the same order. Hence we find in America the same struggles for a shorter working-day, for a legal limitation of the working-time, especially of women and children in factories; we find the truck-system in full blossom, and the cottage-system, in rural districts, made use of by the 'bosses' as a means of domination over the workers.\n\nI wrote up an independent [explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/7wig9u/til_that_helen_keller_was_a_radical_socialist/du10b1b/) for what \"progressives\" actually corresponded to in 19th century European politics.",

        "text": "I haven't done one of these in a while, so pardon me if I'm a little rusty.\n\nMatismus, a military/military history focused gaming channel recently (On Jan.13th of 2018) put out the following video:\n\n[How Did Cold War Battle Tactics Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrVKoWW9sCk)\n\nIt’s about 20 minutes, and falls into some common misconceptions surrounding the prosecution of a general war in Europe during the late Cold War era. I'll do my tried and true timestamped rebuttal.\n\nReady? Let’s go.\n\n****\n\n0:00: I love the background footage throughout, so that’s one check in the “nifty” book. If anyone knows where to find the good quality stock footage of Soviet exercises, let me know.\n\n****\n\n0:12: 7 Days to Rhine isn’t quite right. The wargame was known as “Семь дней до реки Рейн” or “Seven Days to the River Rhine”. A less nitpicky observation would be that this does not accurately reflect Soviet plans regarding a European conflict, but was simply a single scenario of a war game. *It does not represent the definitive war plan it is described as.* I will be referencing the document “How the West Would Have Won”, a collection of forum posts written by Richard Armstrong regarding a conventional war in Europe. Armstrong spent much of the 1980’s and early 1990’s as a corps level intelligence officer for III (US) Corps in Germany. See the bibliography. It's an absolute gem of a document I've only found thanks to /u/tacerror and, by proxy, the late Allen Curtis.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\n****\n\n0:16: I really think the intro is a little overwrought, but that’s just me.\n\n****\n\n0:44: Going to point out that it wasn’t just the Russians. Ukraine was Soviet too! And the East Germans. Some interesting dynamics there, with the Soviets juggling the various Non-Soviet Warsaw Pact armies.\n\n&gt;Our assumption was the Warsaw Pact forces would remain reliable if the Soviet offensive was enjoying success.\n\n&gt;Even with that consideration, we estimated the Soviets had to deal with a few issues in the employment of WP forces. For example, the Soviets would ensure that the East German MD forces would not line up against German NATO corps; they could not have Germans fighting Germans--that would be unreliable. Secondly, same token, the two East German MD would not fight together. In fact we assumed that WP armies would be separated by Soviet units. Third, we knew the Soviets did not want to put Polish forces against the U.S.; they did not believe the Poles would fight Americans (and probably not the Brits).^1\n\n****\n\n2:16: His comment about the “West Germany divide” and US reinforcements are… bewildering. I can only imagine he’s referencing the Soviet plans to cut NATO land forces off from the crucial North Sea ports, as Armstrong mentions:\n\n&gt;”That's why the Soviets' main attack would be through northern Germany, not the Fulda Gap. With limited operational depth, the Soviets/Warsaw Pact would rapidly isolate the U.S. forces in southern Germany from the northern ports and pin them against the Alps while pre-empting staging areas in Holland and Belgium. It's an ugly picture in a conventional environment.”^2\n\n\n[Here's a rough map of the forces Armstrong estimated would be involved at the start of hostilities.](https://i.imgur.com/d1a6tSN.jpg)\n\n****\n\n2:38: \"Initially US reinforcements will be able to fly...\" POMCUS (Prepositioning Of Materiel Configured in Unit Sets) was a vital part of the US contribution to NATO, however, it wasn't perfect. As Armstrong relates:\n\n&gt;\"The U.S. III Corps as the operational reserve for NORTHAG had to come from continental U.S., draw equipment from POMCUS, assemble, organize before commitment--takes a few days.\"^3\n\n\n\n\n****\n\n2:55: \"Fulda\" Possibly the largest misconception of the Cold War is that the Soviets would have pushed their main attack through the Fulda Gap. It makes no sense to put strength against strength in such a manner. Given Armstrong's relation that a late 80's Polish defector confirmed III Corps' estimates, it is very likely that, as mentioned previously, an attack would have been focused on the Dutch Corps Sector between Uelzen and Wittingen, not against US V Corps in the Fulda Gap. [Highlighted in red and blue respectively](https://i.imgur.com/d1a6tSN.jpg?1)\n\n****\n\n3:50: His assessment of the political aims of the war is suspect. While I don't have a citation for this, I would propose that it is unlikely that World War III would stop because the UN asked nicely. It is far more likely that it would end with either a nuclear exchange or a resounding conventional defeat for NATO in Europe, due to the overwhelming conventional imbalance favoring the Warsaw Pact. As Armstrong puts it, \n\n&gt;The conventional balance was heavily weighted in the favor of the Soviet/WP side. As you can see from the estimate laydown, we thought the NATO corps were ill-disposed to handle the estimated main attack. The Americans clearly thought a main attack would be in the CENTAG area, the Fulda Gap to Frankfurt to split NORTHAG and CENTAG. But they did not consider where the Soviet forces would go next; it almost presupposed a limited offensive to gain control of the Germanies. The stakes were too high (inadvertent escalation to nuke exchange) for such a limited objective.^4\n\n\n****\n\n4:12-4:58, transcript\n\n&gt;\"Let's just imagine you're the USSR. High tensions are already suddenly and unexpectedly leading to a war as NATO launches a series of nuclear strikes on the Vistula River in Poland, cutting off access to Poland and East Germany from forces in the USSR and invades East Germany, a common planning scenario involving a enemy first strike. Your first move is to shift and fight to NATO, breaking civilian morale, pour troops over the border, and deny the Atlantic to the US reinforcement convoys. This is in fact the exact story of a 1979 Soviet battle plan which aims to present a fate to actually get the US and UN stopping to get them in seven days at the Rhine, basically D-Day plus seven and getting to Spain by D-Day plus fourteen.\"\n\nMatsimus's estimate of Soviet war aims is interesting. It is very heavily based on the 7 Days to the River Rhine plan, which is not an accurate representation of Soviet war plans during the 1970's and 80's, the time period in question. The Soviet Union was, in reality, not particularly keen on starting a nuclear war after the initial \"Nuclear Euphoria\" of the Kruschev era wore off.^5 Armstrong estimated that the Soviets would ***NOT*** initiate NBC warfare. Conversely, the US, and NATO in general, assumed that the Soviets would be eager to use Chemical Weapons from the outset. [Relevant excerpt from FM-100-2-1 p.16-6](https://i.imgur.com/Y6xAa7Q.png)\n\n&gt;We estimated that the Soviets would not initiate NBC because it would be to their detriment... the German rivers run to the north, where the Soviets would have their main attack, so NATO NBC decontamination up river would pollute streams and rivers in their path. Especially, if the northern German canal was blown, it would have created not only a flood area around Luneburg, but also a contaminated flood plain.^6\n\nAdditionally, interviews with Soviet officers conducted shortly after the Cold War relate that \"...the Soviet Military's confidence in the utility of nuclear weapons for securing this objective [winning a general war in Europe] declined steadily throughout this period. [the 1970's and 80's]\"^7\n\nIn light of this information the war plan known as 7 Days to the River Rhine does not accurately represent how the Soviet Union would have prosecuted a general war in Europe during the 1970's and 80's. The mass use of even 1/4 of the tactical nuclear weapons in Europe, in the Soviet view, would destroy the crucial operational level formations central to the Soviet way of war, and likely escalate to a strategic exchange.^8\n\nLooking back at that transcript and stepping away from the purely historical to comment on presentation, Matsimus really needs to work on his scripts. For example, it is extremely unclear what he means by \"... battle plan which aims to present a fate to actually get the US and UN stopping to get them in seven days at the Rhine, basically D-Day plus seven and getting to Spain by D-Day plus fourteen.\"\n\nWho is stopping? Is the US stopping in seven days? The UN? Both? Or is it the Soviets? Where does Spain come in? He continues mentioning some \"great analysis\" of the plan, which he won't go over too in depth, because he clearly hasn't read it but wants to imply he has and knows what he's talking about.\n\n****\n\n5:11: \"Tactical Nuclear Strikes\" were discussed above, but perhaps it's worth taking a look into what the Soviet considerations for nuclear warfare were. [Here is the relevant sub-chapter of the 1984 edition of FM-100-2-1, the Soviet Army Operations and Tactics](https://i.imgur.com/1eFXjJt.png)\n\nHe states that Soviet Doctrine assumed that both sides could engage in nearly unlimited tactical nuclear war without escalation. As mentioned previously, this is flatly incorrect. The Soviets, beginning in the early 1970's, viewed nuclear war as fundamentally unwinnable, though they still planned to fight and survive one.^9\n\n&gt;\"From the interviews, it appears that the Soviet military command understood the consequences of nuclear war and was intent on preventing it. The General Staff, beginning in the 1970s, developed the idea that nuclear weapons were a political tool, with very limited military utility. This applied to both the strategic and theater use of nuclear weapons. By 1981, the General Staff concluded that nuclear use would be catastrophic as well as counterproductive in combating operations in the European theater. ^10\n\n\n&gt;****\n\n&gt;However, the Soviets neither embraced the concept of fighting a limited nuclear war (confined to Europe, for example), or of managing a nuclear war by climbing the ladder of escalation.^11\n\n****\n\n5:30: The Soviets categorically rejected MAD, that is to say mutual vulnerability, as a principle for a stable and secure strategic posture. For them it was too reminiscent of the situation immediately prior to Barbarossa.^12\n\n****\n\n5:35-6:00: I do not have information on NATO tactical nuclear planning considerations, however a NATO first strike was almost a *pro forma* part of Soviet planning assumptions for a nuclear scenario, a legacy of Barbarossa.\n\n****\n\n6:03: I love how he just tosses out a bit about \"interesting tactical nuclear weapons\" without elaborating further. The background footage isn't even relevant, it's an infantry RPG-7 team taking practice shots at what might be an MT-LB, BTR-50, Sd.Kfz 251 or OT-810, and then an SA-9 GASKIN firing. To the best of my knowledge neither the Warsaw Pact nor NATO ever deployed tactical nuclear infantry anti-tank weapons or short range anti-aircraft missiles.\n\n****\n\n6:13-6:19: The Soviet Union did not plan to conduct nuclear strikes to break morale.\n\n&gt;In the event of nuclear war, the Soviet Union planned to try and strike a mix of cities, industrial centers, and military targets. The proportion of military to industrial targets depended on whether the USSR tried to preempt or launched second. A preemptive Soviet strike would target the enemy’s retaliatory forces, including ICBM silos, airfields, command centers, and naval bases. A retaliatory strike would be aimed at soft military targets (such as airfields and C3 facilities), at U.S. infrastructure (such as transportation grids and fuel supply lines), and cities.^13\n\n\nNowhere does Battilega, or FM-100-2-1 mention morale, with the Soviet General Staff regarding even a limited nuclear war as both catastrophic and counterproductive.\n\n****\n\n6:35: Frankly, the line between Tactical and Strateigic warheads was somewhat blurred with the introduction of numerous theater systems, or weapons like the AGM-69 SRAM or AS-16 KICKBACK, or \"Dial-A-Yield\" bombs which could go from single digit kilotons to the megaton range. That said, strateigic systems with an intercontinental range were unlikely to be used for tactical targets, for reasons of response time, maintenance of retaliatory capability, and the extreme possibility for escalation brought on by the launch of strategic weapons.\n\n****\n\n6:46: Matsimus continues to drone about an imaginary nuclear warfighting doctrine with little basis of reality, when far more noteworthy things are on screen. [Look at how this Soviet Soldier slides down the ramp!](https://gfycat.com/MajesticFirstIndianspinyloach)\n\n****\n\n6:55: I won't dispute the questionable merit of fighting in a tactical nuclear environment. Neither did the Soviets.\n\n****\n\n8:02 The Boiling Vessel was not a feature to protect NBC integrity. It was first featured on the Centurion, of 1945 vintage. The actual purpose of the BV, as best as I can ascertain, was a response to a study of WWII Armored Unit Casualties in NW Europe, which found that, somewhat unsurprisingly, it is somewhat more dangerous to be outside the big armored box when getting shot at, than inside. Unfortunately the only source for this I can find is the less than academically rigorous [War Is Boring](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-british-perfected-the-art-of-brewing-tea-inside-an-armored-vehicle-1cc012f3ee54), so take this with a grain of salt. Not that Matismus cites any sources at all. I've sent a message to Nicolas Moran, /u/The_Chieftain_WG , so we'll see if he gets back about it. I hate citing WiB, so please let me know if you have a proper citation I can use.\n\nBut, of course he forcefully said ***THIS IS A FACT***, which as we all know, you only do when you have a mountain of evidence to support your claim and it isn't at all rectally derived, so he must be right.\n\nIncedentally, of the Cold War field rations I know of, nobody's were \"boil in a bag\". The US Rations were all canned until Meal, Ready to Eat, which introduced the Flameless Ration Heater, and most of NATO used some variation of canned daily ration packs with hexamine stoves.\n\n****\n\n8:25-8:40: Readiness! Always a fun subject! Both sides were not exactly at a constant state of extreme readiness, as implied, as mentioned earlier POMCUS units, such as US III Corps's 1st Cavalry Division, 2nd Armored Division, 5th Infantry Division, and 3rd ACR, or US V Corps's 4th Infantry Division, 194th Armored Brigade, 197th Armored Brigade, and VII Corps's 1st Infantry Division, took 4-7 to get in fighting order. \n\nThe NATO standing force in Europe as of 1988, approximately 24 division-equivalents, would require 30 days to mobilize to it's full wartime strength of 51 divisions. Even accounting for the divisions in theater, generally NATO Planners felt that a bare minimum of 7-10 days was required to get units in fully prepared defensive positions before the Soviet offensive, with some units requiring 2-4 days of road or rail march to even get to their assigned defensive positions. Note, however, that not all NATO contingents deploy at the same rate. 1 (NL) Corps could have 4/10 brigades on line by Mobilization+2, but the rest would take until M+5 to be fully deployed. 1 (GE) Corps stood at 75% combat readiness at all times, and would have been fully combat ready by M+4, while the British had 8 Brigades in Germany, able to be in defensive positions within roughly 24-48h, though additional reserve elements would not be available until at least M+7. 1 (BE) Corps, conversely, was rated as being unlikely to have mobilized to wartime strength before M+7.^14 ^[Citation ^applies ^to ^whole ^paragraph ^and ^previous]\n\nConversely, the Warsaw Pact had 56 Maneuver divisions available in theater, and could roughly double the available forces with a 60 day mobilization. Armstrong gave the forces for the Northern, Central, and Southwestern Fronts as approximately 48 divisions, though each Army and Front have attached independent maneuver Regiments, Brigades, and Divisions which I didn't include in the estimate, so consider it a lower bound.^15, ^16\n\n&gt;In any case, to steal a march of even a few days could give the Soviets a decisive edge over NATO, given the alliance’s dependence on several days of preparation to establish a viable defense. SACEUR’s intelligence staff may warn of the probability of attack for some time, but the doubts of many of NATO’s leaders will delay the decision to institute countermeasures until it is too late. Thus, SACEUR is unlikely to be astonished when the Soviets cross the IGB, but he is likely to be surprised in the military sense, in that he will not have been allowed to deploy and prepare defenses in good time.^17\n\n\n\n****\n\n8:43: A more accurate representation of Soviet Planning goals might be to have penetrated and destroyed the NATO tactical defenses in West Germany and have reached the Rhine within 3-5 days (the first phase of the offensive/Tactical Objectives) with exploitation into Belgium and the Netherlands to cut NATO off from the North Sea ports within 5-7 days (the second phase of the offensive/Operational Objectives), continuing the drive with a turn south to pin what remains of CENTAG against the alps, cut off from resupply, and drive on to the Pyrenees by D+30 (the final phase of the offensive/Strategic Objectives). That said, there are so many moving parts, as Armstrong points out, that after the initial phases of the operation in Germany and BENELUX it becomes increasingly hard to make a meaningful estimation of events.\n\n****\n\n9:22: it's rather likely that the Seven Days To The River Rhine plan didn't include any NATO strikes against forward units because the NATO strikes were somewhat of a *pro forma* event in Soviet war scenarios with nuclear use. \n\n****\n\n9:26: Warsaw Pact loss estimates and rates were actually a norm measured to ascertain how the progress through NATO's forward defense was going. Armstrong relates that Soviet expectations were 25-30% losses in the first echelon breaking through NATO's defenses, with a unit being called to halt or retreat around 50-60% losses. [Also, a relevant quote](https://i.imgur.com/7bGtr2P.png)^18\n\n****\n\n9:32: NATO's defensive plans, as they were actually implemented, *were* a sham.\n\n&gt;While the U.S. turned to look at how to fight in Europe after Vietnam in the mid-'70s, they stumbled around with a disastrous active defense notion--disastrous in the sense that it planned to throw forces into the main sector in front a bone-crushing, Soviet offensive echeloned in depth to chew up the defense. It was not until the mid-'80s that the U.S. Army was equipped with a more flexible concept that thought in terms of deep attack (as limited as it was) and the weapon and intelligence collection systems to fight deeper. Even in the early '90s, IMO, U.S. Army depth in weapons and munitions would have sustained only a very short intensive war period, then things would have reverted to mid-'80s and Soviet weight would re-emerge dominant.^19\n\nFollow On Forces Attack, AirLand Battle and the like were a step in the right direction, and enough to convince the Soviets that the window of viability for their force structure was closing. Hence the shift, in the late 1980's, to the \"defensive doctrine\" aimed to shift the defensive burden to the more robust nuclear deterrent force, while the Soviet economy and military were to have been retooled to excel at the new information-centric warfare which was on the horizon. Then everything fell apart, and nobody's *really* sorted out how to fight a war with all the modern Command, Control, Communications Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance assets, to my understanding, because there's a lot of uncharted territory. Certainly not within the 20 year rule here.\n\n****\n\n9:43: As mentioned previously, the USSR planned, essentially, to play the game \"come as you are\", with only a relatively minor shuffling of 1. Polish Army from Poland to the Northern Front, and a Combined Arms Army from either the Northern Group of Forces in Poland or the Central Group of Forces in Czechoslovakia. This is not a ramping up of forces in theater, but simply a display of the astounding array of combat power ready for war across Germany and the low countries, and down through France.\n\n****\n\n9:50: I'm fairly certain the NATO plan was to nuke their way out of the corner they'd painted themselves into with Active Defense and the concentration on CENTAG. Snark aside, Armstrong's comments on Active Defense hold. It was playing into the strengths of a Soviet Army who had cut their teeth fighting the same sort of tenacious, tactically focused defense that typified the German forces during the latter periods of the Great Patriotic War.\n\n****\n\n10:10: For a video on tactics which has failed to so far talk about any specific tactics he might know about, such as the role of the British Mechanized Infantry Battalion Matsimus is awfully eager to shift to talking about Naval Combat, something I would imagine doesn't come up much in the day to day of a Lance Corporal in the REME, but, I will admit, I am only a civilian, so he must know more than me.\n\n****\n\n10:23: The entire NATO plan doesn't hinge on US Sealifted reinforcements, but on countering a Soviet Offensive which differed significantly than the most likely actual Soviet offensive to take place. While US REFORGER units travelling by sea were useful, as part of NATO's expansion to the wartime structure of 51 Division Equivalents, this still only is a rough parity with the Soviet in-theater forces of 48-56 Division Equivalents.^20\n\n****\n\n10:34: The Tu-95 BEAR was not really any more than a maritime patrol and ASW aircraft. The actual Soviet anti-shipping aircraft were the Naval Air Forces Tu-22M2/3 BACKFIRE B/C and Tu-16N/K-10/RM-1/R/RM-2/K/KSR/KSR-2/K-11-16/K-26 BADGER A/C/D/E/F/G platforms. The Tu-142 was a nifty maritime patrol aircraft, but it was primarily set up for ASW, not hunting NATO convoys. There were a few BEAR-Gs, Tu-95K-22s, set up for launching the Kh-22 (AS-4 KITCHEN), but they were not the primary launch platform, being as laughably unsurvivable as you might expect when confronted with the formidable USN air defenses.^21\n\n****\n\n10:47: There is literally another... thousand, maybe 1500 words I could write on just this bit on the naval war. I am *astounded* by how quickly he manages to get so much wrong. Tokarev's article (Footnote 21) is a good start. From there, perhaps Yefim Gordon's book on the Tu-22/Tu-22M. I'll put that in the bibliography as well.\n\n****\n\n10:59: Why the EE Lightning was mentioned but the Tornado ADV wasn't, is beyond me. Drawing a circle of the roughly 1000 mile combat radius of the Tornado ADV, around RAF Leuchars, the ADV seems almost purpose built to interdict any air movement through the UK end of the GUIK Gap, covering Iceland, it's approaches, and Norway and the Norwegian Sea nearly to Narvik. Conversely the Lightning was built as a point defense interceptor with a ~155 mile combat radius for a supersonic intercept, and a 325 mile subsonic intercept range. I can't confirm this, but it reeks of an argument made based on \"coolness\" rather than actual merit or relevant evidence. Ranges pulled from Wikipedia, so take them with a grain of salt.\n\n****\n\n11:00: Interesting that the bit on the EE Lightning is juxtaposed with footage of the Su-7 FITTER A. They kinda look similar, if you squint, from a distance. Swept wing, nose intake, bubble canopy. Kinda a kitbash of a Su-7 and a Mig-21 FISHBED with over/under engines and it's a Lightning. Is it over yet? Nearly 8 more minutes? I need a drink.\n\n****\n\n11:12: He can't say astute right, and they are in no way comparable to the Type 23. The Type 23 was also first commissioned in 1987, and is really not terribly iconic of cold war British Frigate design, I would put forth the Type 22 (Broadsword/Cornwall class) or the Type 12 (Leander) Class as better contenders.\n\n****\n\n11:28: FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE IT IS PRONOUNCED SOSUS, SEW LIKE A NEEDLE, SUS LIKE SUSPICIOUS.\n\n****\n\n11:41-51: He is saying words. Discretely they have meaning. When he puts them together in the order he says them, they make no sense. What does he mean about put the sea in the way of us and maintain air superiority? Who is us? The Western Allies? By late war they were on the offensive, so no. The Nazis? They had no sea, nor air superiority. The Soviets? They weren't defending either!\n\n****\n\n12:00: [Defense in depth is problematic.](https://i.imgur.com/7bGtr2P.png) Even still, there is a limited amount of Germany do the depth part on before you start running out of land to defend, and now the enemy has all the supplies and materiel you left behind--think all the vehicles left at Dunkirk after the evacuation. His characterization of Operation Barbarossa is completely wrong. [Here's a fun Glantz lecture which is roughly relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qkmO7tm8AU) Suffice it to say that Barbarossa can more accurately be described as two massive armies flinging themselves at each other headlong. Even still, in the Soviet concept of military science the fundamental mode of decision in war was the offensive. Defensive actions were a temporary phase taken to set the stage for a counter offensive. This is an extreme simplification, but we're coming up on four thousand words.^22\n\n****\n\n13:36-13:55: Vis-a-Vis ATGMs, Armstrong addresses this directly, as follows.\n\n&gt;I think that by 1990, the window was rapidly closing for a Soviet offensive based on the massing of armor and mech units, the epitome of the industrial economy army. The massing of tanks was becoming too vulnerable to conventional means of destruction. The first harbinger of this was in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 when Egyptian infantry stood with ATGMs against Israeli tanks. The countermeasures for tanks in add-on armor, smoke protection systems, laser/IR deception devices all worked to extend the life of tanks.\n\n&gt;A couple of things happened in the technology realm that drove the nails into the coffin of massed armor offensives of the WWII vintage. Helicopters began to represent a new mobility force on the battlefield with a force that could rapidly cover the increasing larger corps sectors (part of the increasing dispersion on modern battlefields and I agree with you that it essentially diminishes the dominance of the tank). And there is the countermeasures phenomenon (dialectics in Marxian terms) going on with the infantry getting the anti-aircraft missiles to stand against this new mobility.\n\n&gt;Additionally, intelligence collection systems increased depth and accuracy to the point that they could produce targeting data in addition to just information/intelligence. Combined with the increased targeting capability was over the horizon missiles and rockets (read cruise technology) which could begin to take out armor concentrations long before they arrived in the fight.\n\n&gt;Communications evolved to being able to pass massive amounts of information in near real time through digital communications to facilitate a synergism among the various combat, combat support, and combat service support elements. And now with the aid of computers, the positive and negative feedback loops that are possible, a battle formation has become a complex adaptive force which can self-organize its capabilities to match the requirements of changing situations and be able to immediate battle information, derive lessons and change its operation during the course of the operation (not wait until after the war--which was done for centuries--or after the operations for studies--like the rudimentary process put in place by the Red Army General Staff during WWII). Of course, this line of thinking is future warfare--beyond old fashioned insurgency warfare like what we have in Iraq--and represents the impact of a high-tech economy and the information age.^23\n\n****\n\n14:22: It might be the most profound understatement of the video to say that the Soviet Army was \"actually pretty dang good\". It was, and remains, the undisputed master of industrialized mass army warfare. I say remains as though the sort of warfare it excelled at has been since superseded with the technological innovations which have become prevalent in the post-cold war era, there is a significant amount which NATO did not learn from the Soviets, and really needed to. So as to not breach the 20 year rule, I will abstain from further comment. \n\n****\n\n14:30: The Soviet force ratios weren't absurd, honestly. A roughly 2:1 ratio in their favor with standing in-theater forces, and the same rough ratio with mobilization forces included for both sides, is honestly on the *low* end of what one might expect to carry the attack with, per Clausewitz.^24 However, note that, per Glantz and Armstrong, \"...what I really learned from this drill was how the Red Army leadership played with the correlation of forces and sectors to take apart the German defenses when the strategic numbers were still relatively close. By June 1944, the comparative strength of combat forces on the Eastern Front (by Dave Glantz's studies) was 1.91:1.\"^25\n\nThat said, there are ways to increase the local correlation of forces in your favor without changing the overall numbers. [For example, attacking on a narrower frontage.](https://i.imgur.com/Nb2Ph10.png)\n\n****\n\n14:37: Active Defence felt like losing because that's what it would have been. Sacrificing the bulk of NATO's fighting forces by committing them tactically (as nine out of NATO's ten-to-eleven Corps between NORTHAG and CENTAG were) when faced with an enemy who specializes in breaking through a tactical defense containing the bulk of enemy forces and wreaking havoc on the operational level is the sort of questionable policy that, would it happen in sport, would invite speculation about throwing the match. But, it's important to remember that the purpose of military history isn't to explain how, with hindsight and better information, out of the comfort of our desk chairs, we could have fought a campaign better, but to further understanding, and learn the lessons the past can teach us, lest we have to learn them in blood.\n\n****\n\n14:50: Armstrong assesses the viability of a NATO Deep Attack as follows.\n\n&gt;It makes sense for the option that has the U.S. do a deep attack to Leipzig which was about 150+ kilometers inside DDR. I was personally against this option because that depth would have done nothing to the Soviet main attack. The center of gravity for logistics of the Soviet attack was the concentration of rail lines and roads just south of Berlin. That was a deep attack of nearly 400 kilometers. Beyond the capability of an Army that had focused for years after Vietnam on the defense. Talking with Soviet officers after the period of great unpleasantness, they laughed when they heard the proposal of the deep attack to Leipzig.^26\n\nIt is *incredibly* telling that, when confronted with the absolute latest whiz-bang plan that the US came up with, ***the Soviet officers found it literally laughable.*** If there is a starker description of how poorly NATO miscalculated their war plans, I haven't seen it.\n\n****\n\n14:57: I don't know where the idea of WWI Stoßtruppen tactics influences AirLand Battle. Maybe because the PASGT Helmet looks like a Stalhelm? Is it because Matsimus wants to seem like a smart military history person by referencing the past, even when it's not relevant. The 1982 edition of FM-100-5: Operations, which codified AirLandBattle, makes no reference to WWI Stoßtruppen, referencing instead the far more relevant German campaigns in the East, which led up to Tannenberg. \n\n[The difference between Stoßtruppen tactics and Tannenberg is only a little over eleven hundred kilometers and a completely different mode of combat, attrition based positional warfare on the tactical level, as opposed to fluid operational maneuver on the operational level.](https://youtu.be/ueZ6tvqhk8U?t=16)\n\n****\n\n15:08: [Oh cool, it's one of the British Lances!](https://i.imgur.com/AqbT62n.png) I always wondered why they went to the Royal Artillery instead of, say, 17/21st Lancers. #MakeLancersLanceAgain\n\n****\n\n15:13: It'd be hard to be less aggressive and offensive minded than Active Defense at the operational level short of making Maginot Line II: This time in Germany.\n\n****\n\n15:25: I would question the merit of \"the initiative and decisiveness of unit level commanders\" as a war winning strategy. The Germans in World War Two came from a centuries old tradition of incredibly aggressive unit commanders who sought decisive battles almost pathologically, with perhaps too much initiative to properly control.^27 The Soviet Army bested them, repeatedly and consistently, by out-fighting them on the operational level. \n\nI've been talking a lot, and citing, and quoting Richard Armstrong's *How the West Would Have Won*. Well, here's how NATO actually might have won, other than nuking everything they saw.\n\n&gt;So, How would the West have won...\n\n&gt;The conventional balance was heavily weighted in the favor of the Soviet/WP side. As you can see from the estimate laydown, we thought the NATO corps were ill-disposed to handle the estimated main attack. The Americans clearly thought a main attack would be in the CENTAG area, the Fulda Gap to Frankfurt to split NORTHAG and CENTAG. But they did not consider where the Soviet forces would go next; it almost presupposed a limited offensive to gain control of the Germanies. The stakes were too high (inadvertent escalation to nuke exchange) for such a limited objective.\n\n&gt;NORTHAG clearly needed a more dense disposition of NATO corps along the front line to work against a quick breakthrough scenario. It also needed more than a single corps for an operational reserve since there were at least two realistic breakthrough sectors.\n\n&gt;From the real world disposition, at the first indications of hostility, U.S. VII Corps needed to head north behind the Belgian Corps. A mixed corps of odd NATO divisions would constitute another immediate corps reserve (but this was never exercised during this period).\n\n&gt;A stalled jump-offensive by the Soviets/WP would have opened a window for NATO threat to escalate as additional armies were brought forward to recharge the offensive. I think this was the best case for a conventional NATO victory during this period [late 1980's]--and it still required a threat of going nuclear.^28\n\n****\n\n15:57: From here on I'd be breaking the 20 year rule. It gets increasingly hard to get solid information on capabilities through open source means as well. Read the Armstrong quote I referenced at 13:36-13:55. I think he's hit it near spot on.\n\n****\n\nSo, what did we learn at the end of this? \n\n* Matsimus knows little and less about what he's talking about, having not even read the *excellent* British Army manuals on the subject (The Army Field Manual, Volume II, Part 2, A Treatise on Soviet Operational Art). \n\n* A conventional war in Europe during the late 1980's would either go very poorly for NATO, or not stay conventional for long, or both!\n\n* 6400 words is less than I thought.\n\n* I need a drink. \n\n****\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n1.

I'm not going to talk about this law, since that would be going into modern politics, except to show it as context for the ad and the discussion it's trying to have. This discussion of blame for genocide, though, is an interesting discussion, and one that I think people don't have. It's easy to point to Nazis and say \"the Holocaust is your fault.\" It's much more difficult to step back and analyse how genocides happen and how difficult it is to divide people cleanly into \"victims\" and \"perpetrators,\" as this ad seems to want to do. \n\nI'll start by looking at Poland specifically and the claim that Poles were not complicit in the Holocaust. The ad does an interesting thing that feeds into this narrative. It's a small thing, but you can see at the beginning of the video that the woman in the video is not Jewish - the insignia on the shirt she holds up shows that she is Polish and was imprisoned for being Polish. The image and narrative this creates is of the Poles as victims, equal to the Jews, and suffering as much. In a single image, the ad creates a narrative reshaping the Holocaust and Poland's role within it.\n\nHow much truth is there to this narrative? As I said in my opening paragraph, there is never a clean division between victim and perpetrator. Victims can be perpetrators, and perpetrators can be victims. This is the case with Poland as well.\n\nMuch like the rest of Europe, Poland had escalating anti-semitism throughout the 1930s, particularly as more and more Jews came into the country, fleeing pogroms in the Soviet Union. Most Polish Jews spoke Yiddish as their first language, and despite Jews representing a relatively large minority, especially in some areas, they were seen as outsiders. These factors, coupled with economic instability, caused Jews to become a scapegoat in Poland, much as they had in the rest of Europe. Right-wing political parties such as Endecja urged Poles to boycott Jewish businesses, sometimes escalating to attacks on Jewish communities. Despite its relatively large population of Jews, by the Nazi invasion, Poland could hardly be described as a haven for Jews. Anti-semitism was an undercurrent in Polish society, fed by right-wing parties and fears of Communist collaboration by Jews.\n\nThe Nazi occupation did not necessarily change this attitude. Massacres like the [Jedwabne Pogrom](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/194312/anna-bikont-jedwabne) are illustrations of this. In Jedwabne, Polish Gentiles attacked their Jewish neighbours, murdering the men and burning the women and children alive in a barn. The villagers lied about what happened afterwards, claiming the Germans were responsible. It wasn't until 2000 that the reality of what had happened at Jedwabne became known, and even then, it is still vehemently denied not only in Jedwabne, but throughout Poland. \n\nJedwabne is not a unique event. Throughout the German occupation, Polish Gentiles turned in Jews and those sheltering them, participating in pogroms and violence against the Jewish minority. While it's not clear exactly how many pogroms were committed by Poles and how many by Germans, that there was anti-Jewish violence and active participation in the denunciation and deportation of Jews [is documented](https://www.ushmm.org/information/press/press-releases/collaboration-and-complicity-during-the-holocaust). This, once again, was the case throughout Europe, and Poland is not unique in this. \n\nWhere Poland is unique, however, is the degree to which Poland collaborated with the Nazis. Estimates based on post-war criminal tribunals suggest that 1-2% of Poland's population collaborated with the Nazis, a claim which historians have more or less agreed with. This tiny amount of collaboration also makes absolutely perfect sense. On the one hand, there is collaboration for the sake of survival - denouncing a neighbour to save your own skin, turning someone in so you can buy food. I'm not here to cast a moral judgement on this type of collaboration, but leaving it at the fact that it's an understandable form of collaboration that always happens in the case of oppression. \n\nThe larger reason for the small degree of collaboration, however, is that the Holocaust was not the only genocide happening in Poland. Poles themselves were in a very real fight for survival against a genocidal engine that saw them as subhuman. The fact that Poland didn't have a Quisling or a Petain is partly due to the fact that Nazi Germany didn't see it as needing a Polish government. When Germany invaded, it rebuffed attempts by some conservative Polish political groups to serve as a puppet government, instead installing a German governor and beginning a systematic genocide of the Polish population. \n\nEven beyond genocide itself, Poles were fiercely nationalistic. Quite simply, there wasn't collaboration with the Nazis not because there was any particular love of the Jewish population - the pre-WWII anti-semitic laws are evidence against that - but rather because the Nazis were the ultimate enemy. They destroyed Polish sovereignty. They were trying to destroy Polish identity. They were trying to destroy Poles themselves. Collaborating with them, then, was collaborating with the destruction of Poland, something unthinkable to Poles. Those who did collaborate were dealt with harshly, both during and after the war. This is also why Polish resistance movements were particularly ferocious - they fought for their identity, moreso than other occupied nations. \n\nWhich brings me back to the video and the argument it poses. \"We can't be held responsible for the Holocaust,\" the video - and by extension, Poland - says, \"Because we were victims in it. We are as much victims as the Jews. Germans did this. Germans should be held responsible, not Poles.\" In the context of ~20% of Poland's population being killed during WWII, there's a lot of force in this argument. I am not in any way denying the suffering of and genocide in Poland during WWII. Absolutely, a genocide of both Poles and Jews did occur, and it is a Nazi crime. Being a victim of genocide, however, does not mean one cannot also be a perpetrator and participant in another. It is entirely possible to be both victim and perpetrator.\n\nTo really illustrate this, let's look at Rwanda and the genocide that happened there. You can likely summarise the genocide in one sentence: \"Hutus massacred Tutsis.\" This is true, and a valid summary of the Rwandan Genocide. What's interesting is how much it covers up, though. For instance, there's a third large(ish) ethnic group in Rwanda, the Twa. The Twa were heavily genocided as well, for many of the same racial reasons as the Tutsis. Moderate Hutus were slaughtered. As Paul Kagame's mainly Tutsi RPF army swept into Rwanda from Uganda, they also committed atrocities against Hutus they encountered, as well as causing large numbers of Hutu refugees to flood into neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire and Uganda. In short, the narrative of \"Hutus killed Tutsis\" misses a lot of nuance, and that causes a lot of problems, especially in post-genocide Rwanda. \n\nAs an example of these problems, while the Rwandan government has taken substantial steps towards limiting the association with Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa by removing racial designations from ID cards, that doesn't mean there isn't a memory of this association, or that the association is meaningless to individuals still living in Rwanda. When your neighbours murdered your family, you tend to remember that, even if their ID cards no longer obviously identify them as being part of that ethnic group. Removal of ethnic identity from ID cards is part of a greater initiative by the Rwandan government to teach a unifying doctrine in Rwanda, one that it is illegal to deny or teach otherwise. That unifying idea of what the genocide was can best be summed up as \"Hutus massacred Tutsis,\" but with the caveat of \"but we're not Hutus and Tutsis anymore.\" This doesn't work, and it's part of why Rwanda is still not exactly the happiest country. All Hutus are held to account, and all Tutsis are held as victims, regardless of what their role in the genocide, wartime atrocities, or subsequent wars were. Essentially, having that taught narrative, and having it divided along simple lines of victim-perpetrator creates problems in that it doesn't allow for the exploration of nuance that's necessary for a country to actually heal. \n\nNow look at Poland. Absolutely, Nazis were responsible for the Holocaust, but by saying that the Holocaust and the environment that enabled it was solely German absolves Poland of responsibility it shouldn't be absolved of. Once again, that Poland wasn't a collaborator is a product of Nazi racial philosophy, not any particular nobility on the part of the Polish government. That there wasn't a greater degree of collaboration in Poland is a consequence of nationalism, not of a sense of loyalty to Poland's Jewish population. Laws enacted prior to WWII and the continued denial of atrocities clearly committed by Poles against Jews are evidence enough that anti-Semitism did exist, and that Poland's uniqueness is not necessarily due to a particular nobility that other nations in Europe lacked. Poland is very much playing into the same victim-perpetrator narrative that Rwanda is - \"Nazis killed everyone.\" It misses the nuance, and in doing so, it becomes much, much more difficult for Poland to heal. \n\nVictim-perpetrator narratives are easy. It's easy to say that victims cannot themselves be complicit or silent or even active in violence committed against others. It's easy to look at low direct collaboration numbers and argue that it was impossible for Poland to be held responsible because they were suffering as well. And I in absolutely no way mean to victim blame or belittle the suffering of Poland, nor do I intend to say that Poland should be judged harshly and held responsible for the Holocaust. What I *do* mean to say is simply that it's bad history to say that Poland had no role in the Holocaust - even though Poles and the nation of Poland were victims of Nazi genocide, they were also participants in genocide, through collaboration, through bigotry that had existed and continued to exist throughout the occupation, and through denying atrocities committed by Poles. Because that's ultimately what this video is doing - by relabelling the genocide as strictly German, it's denying what Poles did to contribute to the Holocaust, and it's rewriting history to mitigate atrocities. \n\nFor a nation to heal, it has to acknowledge what happened. It has to step back, say \"we may have done some things that are less than stellar,\" and apologise. I don't hold Poland as a nation accountable for Treblinka or Auschwitz. I do hold Poland as a nation accountable for Jedwabne and the pogroms that happened prior to and throughout the Nazi occupation of Poland. I hold Poland accountable for denying that Poles were responsible for these pogroms. It isn't necessary for a nation to have formally collaborated for it to be held to account for trying to erase history after the fact. In some ways, that denial of history is a continuation of genocide, not in the sense of actual murder, but in the sense that identity is erased, and truth is erased in favour of something more comfortable - this idea that the world can be neatly divided into heroes and villains, occupiers and resistance, perpetrators and victims. It can't be, and attempts to make history fit into this box end very badly.\n\n**Sources!**\n\nAs with every genocide post, I'm citing *Blood and Soil* by Ben Kiernan. He goes into a lot of detail about Poland during WWII and specifically the forced migration of Poles. It's interesting, even if I don't necessarily agree with all his theories. In general, if you're interested in genocide studies, I highly recommend Kiernan's work.\n\n*A Problem from Hell* by Samantha Power, which talks more about genocides after the Holocaust, but which still has great information about Raphael Lemkin's life and experiences with the Holocaust in Poland specifically.\n\n[Here's](https://www.ushmm.org/information/press/press-releases/collaboration-and-complicity-during-the-holocaust) a nice overview of the Polish response to the Holocaust. It's short and sweet, unlike this post.\n\n*Out of the Inferno* by Richard Lukas gives a really nice overview of both the Polish genocide and the Holocaust and how the two intersected. It's basically a collection of narratives from Poles remembering their personal experiences. It's interesting both in a primary source kind of way, and in what the narrators choose to discuss. I recommend it if you're interested in the general Polish experience during WWII.\n\n\"Why the Poles Collaborated so Little: And Why That Is No Reason for Nationalist Hubris\" by John Connelly, published in the Slavic Review. This article does a great job going into motivations behind the lack of collaboration and how Polish nationalism actually manifested both shortly before and during the occupation.\n\n[Another easy source](https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/resistance-during-holocaust/jewish-life-poland-holocaust) about pre-Holocaust Jewish life in Poland\n\n[This](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-03-24/massacre-villages-jews-their-neighbors-wwii-poland-remembered-and-misremembered) and [this](http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/194312/anna-bikont-jedwabne) are both excellent articles about Jedwabne, and particularly about how it was remembered and continues to be responded to in Poland.\n\n[This](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/06/polish-president-to-sign-holocaust-bill-despite-international-concerns/?utm_term=.4c9c3ec1a1a4) is an article providing further context to the video I'm critiquing here. Once again, I'm not interested in discussing the politics of this law, but this is extra context to understand the discussion that's being had in Poland.\n\n[not politics i swear](http://www.polin.pl/en/news/2018/01/29/statement-of-the-director-of-polin-museum-concerning-a-proposed), but an interesting statement from the Museum of the History of Polish Jews about this law and its ramifications for how we examine history and reflect on the Holocaust. It's another way of phrasing the basic argument I've laid out in this post - structuring history with a particular, naive narrative erases history. \n\n[I consulted this source as well.

        "text": "https://np.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/7wdfr7/i_dont_see_color_but_i_want_a_white_doctor_who/dtzutvo/?context=1\n\nCopypasting the original comment here in case it gets removed/edited:\n\n&gt; The confederate flag was the official flag of a slave nation for a couple of years.\n\n&gt; The US flag was the official flag of a slave nation for nearly 90 years - and of a nation that slaughtered native Americans, that fought totally unnecessary and often secret wars in Europe, Asia, Africa, and South and Central America, cages peaceable people for owning plants, caged Japanese Americans for being Japanese, locked up journalists at various points from the beginning of its founding to at least as recently as WWI, and [continued a system of slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict_lease) that was often even worse than the slavery that had been supposedly abolished.\n\n&gt; No matter what you say the US flag stands for, what it actually conveys is kind of universally horrible to a tremendously greater degree and for a more sustained period than the confederate flag.\n\nThis was posted in a discussion about a black premedical student's experience with racism from a patient. It's a prettied up version of [this famous meme](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CITVXjmUkAA6T64.jpg), popular with Lost Causers, Irish Slavers, and Ron Paul. I'm going to focus chiefly on the white supremacy in this comment, namely the CSA apologia and the bit about Convict lease. The other details--the Cold War, Japanese internment, the Native Americans--are mere smokescreens here. It's like the way Wehraboos often point out that the British invented the concentration camp to hold rebellious Boers. It's not exactly a *lie*, but it serves to draw attention away from an uglier truth.\n\nNow, let's break this down! I'll hit the *more years with slavery = more racist* meme first:\n\n&gt; The confederate flag was the official flag of a slave nation for a couple of years. The US flag was the official flag of a slave nation for nearly 90 years\n\nAnyone with a third grader's grasp of math should look at this and laugh. First, \"a couple of years\" means two years. 1861-1865 means four years. Second, from 1776 to the passage of the 13th Amendment in 1864, we have 88 years of slavery in *parts of* the United States. The USA has existed for 242 years, giving us a third of US history during which slavery was allowed. The Confederacy, on the other hand, allowed slavery for 100% of its history.\n\nThis argument is almost too silly to merit further rebuttal, but I'll give it one anyway. Notice how I said that slavery was practiced in *parts of* the United States? Well, those *parts* of the United States that had slavery were the very same ones that broke away to form the CSA in 1861. Every state, territory, and native American tribe that joined the CSA practiced slavery on a large scale. Every so-called Border State--the slave states that remained nominally in the Union--had large-scale defections to the South. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia [even re-enslaved free blacks](http://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2013/06/30/Confederates-slave-hunt-in-North-a-military-disgrace/stories/201306300221) during its invasion of Pennsylvania in 1863, under the pretext of seizing \"contraband\" (i.e. runaways):\n\n&gt; Historians have found no evidence that Confederate President Jefferson Davis or his secretary of war, James A. Seddon, directly ordered Confederate troops to seize African-Americans. But the practice was so widespread -- as attested to in newspaper articles, diaries, soldiers' letters -- that some historians say it is hard to argue that the kidnappings were the work of rogue units in the Army of Northern Virginia.\n\nSo every state in the CSA practiced slavery, and did so for as long as the CSA existed. That's because slavery was the Confederacy's single *raison d'être*. Without slavery (or, conversely, without Northern hostility to slavery), there would have been no secession. Here is what Alexander Stephens, the vice-president of the CSA, [said](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/stephens.html) in his 1861 \"Cornerstone Speech\" in Savannah:\n\n&gt; The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to [slavery] while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the \"storm came and the wind blew.\" **Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.**\n\nThat's an explicit repudiation of the U.S. Constitution for *not* safeguarding slavery and white supremacy. The Constitution was, it is true, designed to make slavery difficult to abolish, but it didn't offer the ironclad protection the white South wanted.\n\nIf you need more proof, see what the CSA's member states said in their [various articles of secession](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/secession.html).\n\n**Mississippi:**\n\n&gt; Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun.\n\nand\n\n&gt; [The Union] denies the right of property in slaves, and refuses protection to that right on the high seas, in the Territories, and wherever the government of the United States had jurisdiction. It refuses the admission of new slave States into the Union, and seeks to extinguish it by confining it within its present limits, denying the power of expansion. [...] It has nullified the Fugitive Slave Law in almost every free State in the Union, and has utterly broken the compact which our fathers pledged their faith to maintain. It advocates negro equality, socially and politically, and promotes insurrection and incendiarism in our midst.\n\n**Texas:**\n\n&gt; The States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa, by solemn legislative enactments, have deliberately, directly or indirectly violated the [the fugitive slave clause] [...] In all the non-slave-holding States [...] the people have formed themselves into a great sectional party, now strong enough in numbers to control the affairs of each of those States, based upon an unnatural feeling of hostility to these Southern States and **their beneficent and patriarchal system of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality of all men, irrespective of race or color-- a doctrine at war with nature, in opposition to the experience of mankind, and in violation of the plainest revelations of Divine Law.** They demand the abolition of negro slavery throughout the confederacy, the recognition of political equality between the white and negro races, and avow their determination to press on their crusade against us, so long as a negro slave remains in these States.\n\n**South Carolina**\n\n&gt; A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and **all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.** He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that \"Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,\" and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction.\n\n---\n\nNow I want to specifically address [Convict Lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convict_lease). This person claims that the USA tolerated of \"a system of slavery that was often even worse than the slavery that had been supposedly abolished,\" but he doesn't say where convict lease was practiced. It was practiced in--surprise!--the South. You literally can learn this from reading the first sentence of the Wikipedia article. It was, like sharecropping, one of the many ways Reconstruction failed to stamp out the vestiges of slavery. And it was very much a Southern practice, just like the slavery that had existed before it. Alex Lichtenstein, quoted in the Wikipedia article, writes:\n\n&gt; only in the South did the state entirely give up its control to the contractor; and only in the South did the physical \"penitentiary\" become virtually synonymous with the various private enterprises in which convicts labored.\n\nAnd here's Frederick Douglass, same source as the above:\n\n&gt; The Convict Lease System and Lynch Law are twin infamies which flourish hand in hand in many of the United States. They are the two great outgrowths and results of the class legislation under which our people suffer to-day.\n\nTLDR, Convict Lease was a direct continuation of antebellum slavery, and not an invention of the sneaky North.\n\n---\n\nLastly, I'm going to address some of the charges he makes against the US which he says make it worse than the Confederacy.\n\nThe easiest one to puncture is his claim that the USA, and not the CSA, was an imperialist power. That's technically true: a state that exists for only four years, is fighting and losing a defensive war for all four of those years, and never gains diplomatic recognition is going to have a very hard time colonizing the Philippines or orchestrating coups in Chile. It wasn't for lack of ambition, though. The Confederacy had its own version of the Manifest Destiny, which it might well have pursued if it had somehow won--and with it, expanded slavery in the Americas. This would have meant that the entire population of Haiti, and most of the Caribbean, would have been re-enslaved. South Carolina lawmaker Robert Rhett had this to say in the runup to secession:\n\n&gt; We will expand, as our growth and civilization shall demand – over Mexico – over the isles of the sea – over the far-off Southern tropics – until we shall establish a great Confederation of Republics – the greatest, freest and most useful the world has ever seen.\n\nThen there's his charge that the USA imprisoned journalists. What does he think happened to Southerners who spoke out against slavery? There's a [long history](https://wakespace.lib.wfu.edu/bitstream/handle/10339/16046/Curtis%20Curious%20History%20of%20Attempts%20to%20Suppress%20Antislavery%20Speech,%20Press,%20and%20Petition%20in%201835--37.pdf) of Southern attempts, before and during the Civil War, to suppress anti-slavery speech. You only have to open that PDF and ctrl+F \"prosecution.\" Here's one:\n\n&gt; A Virginia state prosecution occurred in 1839 for circulating an abolitionist petition to Congress. *p 849*\n\nAnd here:\n\n&gt; In 1836, Reuben Crandall was tried for circulating incendiary (abolitionist) papers in the District of Columbia. *p 854*\n\nAnd before anyone says it, DC was set up as the capitol to *appease* the South. It was culturally Southern in many ways.\n\nOn page 856 we read that the South even toyed with setting up legal pathways to extradite Northern abolitionists to the South to stand trial for libel:\n\n&gt; Yet another legal theory to suppress abolitionists for publications reaching the South was to punish Northern disseminators under Southern laws in Southern courts.  This \"bright idea,\" as abolitionist legal theorist William Jay ironically called it, had obvious advantages. Virtually the entire abolitionist leadership could be prosecuted. The prosecutions would take place in a venue where juries would be most sympathetic to slavery and most hostile to abolitionists. [...] Southerners argued by analogy that a culprit who fired a mortar across state lines from a Northern to a Southern state should be extradited. Why should the rule be different for abolitionists launching their incendiary verbal missiles from the North to the South?\n\nThat's all, folks. Thus ends the curious case of the Confederacy apologist who tried to win by appealing to liberal values.",

        "text": "The term seems to be cropping up more and more often in recent years, with President Obama making the blunder in 2012 and more recently last month, this time not a blunder but a full on case of badhistory, Prime Minister of Israel along with Yair Lapid the leader of the opposition both not only used the term, during Holocaust Remembrance Day no less, but refused to correct it (quotes below).\n\n\nEach time it's used it causes a stir which eventually leads to a discussion of Polish antisemitism. Most recently Poland passed a controversial law banning the term which lead to an even louder discussion of the term and still louder versions of bad history thrown around.\n\n\nHere is a link, one of a few in the past two weeks on r/europe all similar in nature https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/7w411z/death_camps/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link\n\n\nTo be fair there was also this https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7t8eka/poland_moves_to_make_use_of_phrase_polish_death/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link\n\n\n**The perfidy, and real danger of the term is:**\n\n\n**1) it allows room for equivocation, since some of the camps were located on German occupied, but still Polish, territory, letting those saying it, stand back, feign innocence and ignorance and appeal to an irrelevant technicality**\n\n\n**2) leads to discussions of unrelated instances of Polish antisemitism, piggybacking them incorrectly into Hitler's Final Solution Nazi German Death Camps. This in turn:**\n\n\n**3) allows for an easier blend of facts with fiction, especially to those less familiar with the events (which will be more and more people as witnesses die out) leading to a case of some very badhistory: *something something Poland WWII...something something Extermination Camps...Jews....antisemitism...Polish Camps.* And new history is written.**\n\n\nLike much of Europe, there were cases of antisemitism and sometimes violence against its Jewish minority. However, Poland did end up with the highest percentage of Jews (which may be why most of the camps were located on its territory?) which leads one to believe Poland had to have been pretty welcoming to the Jews, more so than anywhere else at least...\n\n\nThese camps were thought up, planned out, organized and run by Nazi Germany. None of Poland's history, passed or present matters when arguing how to refer to the owners i.e. those responsible for the camps. Poland could have organized it's own death camps the day after the end of WW2 that would not change anything regarding these particular camps. All that matters in this discussion is who was the responsible party was for these camps. And the truth is more blatant than that - Poland suffered immensely during WW2, millions of its citizens being slaughtered in both camps and on the streets of its destroyed and occupied cities. Calling them Polish Death Camps is tantamount to calling them....Jewish Death Camps, which actually would be more accurate and appropriate because there is no danger that the Jews will be confused for the executors. Although if pressed, one could point to the Auschwitz death camp and say \"Jewish death camp\", as Jewish Sonderkommando inmates had run its crematoria.\n\n\nBut that fact is not well known and so in theory, Jewish Death Camps wouldn't be that bad of a term (if the Jewish people had been the only victims of the Nazi Regime) so long as it was absolutely clear what \"Jews\" refers to (those who died). With the Polish death camps it is pretty clear that this usage has room enough for some piggybacking of bad history.\n\n\nItaly and Japan shared a side with Germany during WW2. Italy had the fascist movement...But I wouldn't want these camps called Axis or Fascist Death Camps....\n\n\nFrance could have done more, way more, so could a few other countries, but I don't propose we call them French Death Camps.\n\n\nThere was a Nazi German Death Camp in Holland and the Dutch moral record is less than squeaky clean (Africa) does not mean we should be calling them Dutch Death Camps.\n\n\nAmerica turned away the \"St Louis\" a ship with thousands of Jewish refugees, many of whom ended up in the camps, and many who died then when the American authorities refused them entry and they were forced to go back to Germany. But they shouldn't be called American Death Camps.\n\n\nIn fact Witold Pilecki a Polish officer was the first to go undercover into a concentration camp and escape, in order to gather intelligence for the West about the atrocities perpetrated there.\n\n\nIn articles about the controversy of the term, I see \"Polish Death Camps\" compared and contrasted with \"Nazi Death Camps\" - the word \"German\" is not even used anymore. Like that's not even comparing apples to oranges, that's comparing apples to say \"Blood Oranges\" (or some other sub type of an orange). Worse still, a subtype that could potentially span other fruits. I'm not sure what Nazi actually means and what it refers to but I'd have a problem calling both the owners of those camps AND today's NeoNazis by the same word because today's neo-nazis are not responsible for those camps. Maybe they will be responsible for future camps but not those.\n\n\nFrom the New York Times “One cannot change history, and the Holocaust cannot be denied.”Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement released on Saturday\"\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/world/europe/poland-israel-holocaust-law.html\n\n\nThat's a nice little red herring fallacy if I've ever seen one. With a dash of poisoning the well thrown in for good measure. Sure, the Holocaust cannot be denied but why would someone fighting tooth and nail against an accusation about something if they were trying to deny that very thing? I won't be putting up much of a fight against the accusation that I assassinated Santa Clause last December, since I am denying Santa Clause happened.\n\n\nHe could have also added that the Earth not being flat cannot be denied as well. Or that evolution never happend because that one's a hotter potato today, that nobody sane wants to be caught holding.\n\n\nThe New York Times article than goes on to mention how the Israeli journalist Lahav Harkov tweeted “Polish death camps” 14 times.\n\n\nIf the general consensus is currently to not refer to those camps as German Death Camps (which I agree with) but as Nazi Death Camps how in God's name did Poland with Polish Death Camps make it into popular discourse today?\n\n\nPolish rebuttal https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/opinion/poland-holocaust.html",

        "text": "\nWhile it’s tempting to write Stefan Molyneux off as some fringe bozo on the margins of public discourse, he has a cult following roughly the size of the population of Alaska and his influence reaches beyond the confines of his little Youtube fiefdom. Freedomain Radio supplies the factoids that make up countless viral right-wing memes, such as this [one](https://pics.me.me/karl-marx-never-ran-a-company-never-held-political-office-1347786.png), which is more or less a summary of Molyneux’s video “The Truth About Karl Marx.”\n\nOne of the more popular videos in that series, “The Truth About Slavery,” has been viewed some 880,000 times, and though it was released in 2014 many of its dubious “truths” are still making their way into the mainstream. In 2017, a series of viral slavery memes echoed the video’s core points—[the Irish were slaves too]( https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/us/irish-slaves-myth.html?_r=0), [very few white Americans benefited from slavery]( http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/24/viral-image/viral-post-gets-it-wrong-extent-slavery-1860/) and [black people owned slaves]( https://www.theroot.com/did-black-people-own-slaves-1790895436).\n\nHis argument boils down to: Slavery was this bad thing that existed since time immemorial (but the Muslims were worse btw) and then white people put an end to it, so why do *they* catch beef?\n\n&gt; This is one of the great misconceptions of history. So Western Europeans were very late to the party. The Muslim slave trade went on for 1,400 years. The Christian slave trade went on for a few hundred years. They were late to the party. They took very few of the slaves, as we shall see. They treated their slaves far better than what occurred in the Muslim countries, as we shall also see. So Europeans ended up fighting against slavery. Europeans ended slavery. So, of course, you only hear Europeans being *blamed* for slavery. This is horribly unjust.\n\nBut what really separates Molyneux’s video from your garden variety apologia is that he views slavery through the lens of ”anarcho”-capitalist ideology. \n\n&gt; The Atlantic Slave Trade was not a result of market forces. It was developed under the power of the state… Slavery wasn’t economically efficient or driven by the free market\n\nHe even goes so far as to argue that were it not for the pernicious meddling of the state, the Hidden Hand of the market could very well have smashed the chains of slavery.  \n\n\n##Colonial ’Crony capitalism’\n\nMolyneux argues that the Atlantic slave trade was an evil born of a favorite libertarian boogeyman: “crony capitalism.” He asserts that slavery was not a “free market” because the slave trade was founded as a government monopoly. While it’s true that the slave trade in many countries started as a monopoly, this didn’t last long. The [Royal African Company]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_African_Company), which Molyneux mentions, only had a monopoly on the trade from 1660 to 1689, and during that time, it transported roughly 5 percent of the more than 2 million slaves shipped by the British Empire. After 1689, the trade was opened to other firms on condition that they paid a 10 percent levy to the RAC. \n\nMolyneux never really explains how having more actors competing in a free trade of slaves would somehow be preferable to government monopolies, especially since this would—and did— increase the scale of the trade. \n\nSome of the originators of laissez-faire ideology actually pointed to the slave trade in France as a [free-market success story]( https://aeon.co/essays/why-the-original-laissez-faire-economists-loved-slavery): \n\n\n&gt; With yet another economic crisis on its hands, the French government took a desperate, unprecedented step. In defiance of mercantilist ideas, it deregulated the slave trade. For the first time, the monarchy allowed private firms to send slave ships to Africa and on to the Americas.  \n\n&gt; There would be no new state monopoly company to control the French slave trade. From a business perspective, the result was a wild success. Private traders sent increasing numbers of slaves to France’s colonies of Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue (now Haiti). At the beginning of the 18th century, a few thousand slaves were brought to the French Caribbean each year. By the end of the 18th century, more than a 100,000 slaves were taken there annually.  \n\n&gt; This economic boom was a human tragedy. Slavery was brutal everywhere in the Americas, but slavery in France’s sugar plantations might have been the most brutal of all. Many enslaved Africans died before reaching the Caribbean colonies and, once they arrived, their average life expectancy was less than five years. They were simply worked to death. It was no accident that Saint-Domingue, the largest French colony, would be the scene of the most important and most violent slave revolt in the history of the Americas. \n\n\nThe French deregulation of the slave trade was cited in a campaign against the monopoly of the French East India Company spearheaded by French economist Andre Morellet, the protégé of Vincent de Gournay, who coined the term laissez-faire.  \n\n&gt; Morellet insisted that state enterprises in general should be abolished, and cited the success of French slave traders after 1720 as proof of the superiority of laissez-faire over mercantilism. To those who felt that the deregulation of France’s trade with Asia was too risky, he answered: “This pretext is always relied on in the creation of monopoly Companies, and notably in the trade in Negroes on the African coast … *However since then it has been observed that this competition, far from destroying commerce, sustained it.* The French colonies in America had remained, until then [1720], in a state of great weakness; liberty revived them.” Liberty, of course, meant in this case the expansion of the slave trade. Colonial slavery was a force for economic freedom.\n\nInterestingly, Morellet, in true libertarian fashion, also argued that naked self-interest was the great equalizer. \n\n&gt; Indeed, the slave trade proved that Africans and Europeans were, at least in economic terms, exactly alike, hardly different after all: “the truth is that, on the subject of trade, people… act in the same way, because they are all guided by the same principle, that is to say, by interest.” Morellet reasoned that the slave trade proved Africans were equal to Europeans. Self-interest motivated both groups to sell or purchase enslaved people.\n\n\n##No permission for manumission\n\nThe next truth bomb that Stefan drops is that slavery would have probably just petered out on its own had the government not stepped in and “banned freedom.” He speculates that more slave-owners would have freed their slaves were it not for laws banning the practice, and that the presence of more freedmen in the labor markets would have driven the prices of slaves down to the point where it was somehow not economically profitable anymore.\n\nThere are so many holes in Molyneux’s fabled logic that I don’t know where to begin. For starters, the biggest factor in reducing the number of manumissions was the invention of the cotton gin in 1794. Before the arrival of the cotton gin, the number of manumissions annually was small but significant, but afterward it dropped to near zero. King Cotton was crowned and the demand for agricultural labor skyrocketed. Though most states in the South pass edlaws against manumission, it wasn’t until after the revolt of [Nat Turner in 1831](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713592), and by then, manumission was already a rarity. Manumission as a phenomenon tended to be more affected by [economic factors]( https://books.google.com/books?id=wJcNNBiGZqsC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=manumission+cotton+gin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ixggqPZoai&amp;sig=VkOmJeL2sOE0rkr1L7XXwJfPVgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC-Mqq4ovZAhXIi1QKHc6BB5QQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=cotton%20gin&amp;f=false) than any one law. \n\n\nBut let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that there were no laws against manumission. Does it really follow that a modest increase in the supply of free labor would have any discernable effect on the institution of slavery, much less the ability to peacefully end it? I’m actually amazed at how Molyneux manages to botch so badly the one economic concept libertarians usually have a tentative grasp on: supply and demand. \n\nYou can’t really apply normal market principles where slavery and free labor coexist. There’s no competition in the labor market between a free person and a slave because prices can’t get lower than zero. Furthermore—and it has been a long time since I took high school economics—but if I recall correctly, when you reduce the supply of something and the demand stays the same, the price goes up. If anything, the manumission of a few slaves would make the remaining slaves more valuable as commodities.\n\nThere’s a glaring gap in this whole narrative. According to Molyneux, the government is in cahoots with the elite class of slaveholding crony capitalists, on whose behalf they pass laws against manumission. But he’s expecting the very people who are lobbying so fiercely against manumission to free their slaves out of Christian kindness. \n\n\n## Slavery is like taxes\n\nTo cap off a video that conflates white indentured servitude with black chattel slavery and the plantation system of the Americas with the household slavery of Ottoman empire, Molyneux rides the false equivalence train all the way to the end of the line: taxes are a modern-day form of slavery.\n\n\n&gt; When you force someone to hand over 100 percent of their earnings, that’s pure slavery. What percentage of your earnings are forced over at the hands of the state? We really haven’t fundamentally outgrown it as an institution. We’ve become free range serfs or slaves. We can choose our own occupations but we must still remit property taxes and income taxes and all forms of taxation to the state in order to secure our freedom.\n\n\nThen he repeats his thesis that slavery isn’t real capitalism\n\n\n&gt; And we’ve also thought that it has something to do with the free market so we think our enemies are racial and our enemy is the free market. Well it is not a racial institution and it was the complete opposite of the free market. It was a central, fascistically controlled pseudo market. It’s called “crapitalism”—crony capitalism—where you use the power of the state to benefit financial interests. That’s not a free market at all.\n\n\nAnd then he reminds us that the real victim of American slavery was, of course, property rights\n\n\n&gt; Forcing people to not do what they want with their own property. If slaves are property, you should be able to set them free, right? Banning people from setting their slaves free is not even treating slaves as property.\n\n\nFinally, he hammers home his point by denying the racial character of American slavery one more time and once again listing taxpayers among the enslaved people of history.\n\n&gt; Well the facilitation of slavery—the violent power of the state which made slavery possible and sustained its continuance—was imposed upon both whites and blacks and mulattoes and Chinese and Irish and you name it. It was imposed upon them against their will just as the national debt is imposed on your children against their will just as the bank bailouts are imposed on you against your will\n\nI just want to end by saying it doesn’t matter how gung ho you are about capitalism. Even if you’re the Second Coming of Ayn Rand, you can’t deny that the profit motive was core to the entire enterprise of slavery. Slaves were used because the market couldn’t allocate enough labor to sustain the massive transcontinental enterprise that was colonialism. To the extent that free labor could be drawn to the New World, it posed logistical problems for colonial management because there was an ever-present threat of revolt by free laborers.\n\nIt was the pursuit of profit that drove the slave trade to reach such an unprecedented scale. Profit prompted slave traders to pack black men and women so tightly onto ships that they could barely move. Profit drove overseers to literally work slaves to death. And though Molyneux gives the British the lion’s share of the credit for “ending slavery,” the prosperity of the Southern slave economy depended heavily on demand from British industry—particularly the textile magnates of Liverpool. [They even supplied the Confederacy]( http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/liverpools-abercromby-square/britain-and-us-civil-war/impact-cotton-trade) and maintained trade ties with them throughout the Civil War in defiance of the Northern blockade.\n\nI’ve done a lot of research into some of the other claims in this 40-minute parade of half-truths. And when I have time I’ll do another post. As much as I hate to spend any more time dissecting Molyneux’s videos or listening to his pseudointellectual blathering, there are actually some interesting and legitimate historical issues that are worth discussing, particularly the differences between slavery in the Muslim world and that of the Americas. So stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\n",

The witch hunts were a holocaust of women; a political move by the church, during the rise of Christianity and the fall of Rome, to discredit female healers and midwives who, up until then, had been respected, equal, and admired members of their community. Also, to change female sexuality from something that was celebrated amongst the old religions into a shameful sin and something that stands as an obstacle between men and holiness.\n\n&gt;The next time someone tells you that gender roles and gendered values are ‘just how it is,’ remind them that the Catholic Church murdered millions of women over hundreds of years through Europe, the states and other countries just because they were scared and disgusted by the thought of women being respected.\"\n\nLink: \nhttps://lunaeagreene.tumblr.com/post/169333216332/women-vs-christianity-the-burning-times-were-not \n\nFirstly: \n&gt;\"The Burning Times were not just a couple hundred witches burned by puritans in Salem.\"\n\nLet's start by correcting two things in the first sentence.\nThe English in this period, and by extension, their colonies in America, did not burn witches. They hanged people convicted of witchcraft. The other thing is that it was nowhere near hundreds of people that were hanged, not burned, in Salem. There were 20 hangings for witchcraft in Salem. And this includes men, women, and even pets. There were more people that were accused, but the number was never in the hundreds for Salem. \n\n&gt;\"The witch hunts were a holocaust of women; a political move by the church, during the rise of Christianity and the fall of Rome, to discredit female healers and midwives who, up until then, had been respected, equal, and admired members of their community. Also, to change female sexuality from something that was celebrated amongst the old religions into a shameful sin and something that stands as an obstacle between men and holiness.\" \n\nI also take issue with the statement that until Christianity came along, female healers were respected, equal, and admired members of their communities who were freely able to engage in sexual relations in the 'old religions'. Ancient Rome was not an egalitarian utopia by any means. Women did not have the same rights as men in Rome or Greece even before Christianity, and while men were more permitted to engage in extramarital affairs, women were not. Other pre-Christian societies in Europe likewise were not egalitarian utopias where women were respected and equal - healers or not. \n\nThe Church was not targeting these women for being healers and being afraid of them.\nPeople, primarily women, but also men and even animals, could be accused of witchcraft at many different times in European and colonial histories, often they were marginalized people in their communities such as widows and poor people, who may be accused when something goes wrong, such as a cow falls sick, and the person may have been seen walking nearby or even being rude to the farmer. Family and friends of accused might also in turn be accused, which does not limit it to women, as husbands could often be included, or anyone perceived to be \"behaving badly\" so to speak. \nDuring the Salem witch trials, John Alden was accused, and as evidence against his character, he was stated to have been trading with local Indigenous peoples, providing them with ammunition - this during a period of intense hostilities between English colonists and Native Americans, was part of this \"bad behaviour\".\nChurches often were not directly involved in this - the Clergy were not running around accusing people, this was community members, villagers, doing the accusing. And it was taken to courts, where the authorities were often rather skeptical, since witch craft is difficult to prove in a court of law. \nThe narrative of the Church murdering midwives is a common one, but it does not hold water.\nIs there a religious element to many of the trials? Yes, of course, Satan's hold on witches and the panic and threat of witch craft to Christian society was very much a predominant part of the trials.\nHowever, saying that the Church specifically targeted midwives and healers because they were misogynists is a completely different narrative that does not hold up.  \n\nSources:\n\nBen-Yehuda, Nachman. \"The European Witch Craze of the 14th to 17th Centuries: A Sociologist's Perspective.\" American Journal of Sociology 86, no. 1 (July 1980): 1-31. \n\nDemos, John. \"Underlying Themes in the Witchcraft of Seventeenth-Century New England.\" The American Historical Review 75, no. 5 (June 1970): 1311-326.\n\nDurston, Gregory.

        "text": "I've been reading These United States by Glenda Gilmore and Thomas Joseph Sugrue. Nevermind criminally ignoring economic factors in almost every significant event in US history from 1890 onward and simplifying history to character archetypes, I found some particular passages regarding global history quite fascinating as a case study of American stupidity (kidding, sort of)\n\n\"The United States could have expanded its influence in the Pacific, but opportunities were limited because other powers had already carved up much of Asia... the British had taken the lead in putting down the Boxer Rebellion in China\" (58)\n\nThis passage explains the \"lack\" of US involvement in Asia (because anything less than conquest is absence) by stating that European nations had already taken all the opportunities, already an incredibly oversimplified claim, but then uses the example of \"the British\" putting down the Boxer rebellion. So yeah, who cares about the *Eight Nation Alliance* and the fact that the Gaselee Expedition's Japanese and Russian troops completely outnumbered the British, who cares that using this as an example of lack of American involvement falls a little short when the US *is one of the Eight Nations*. We're making a point in a grand American narrative of isolation here! What's a Matthew Perry?\n\nBut wait, that's just an appetizer\n\n\"The idealistic Fourteen Points clashed with the punitive terms of the Treaty of Versailles... The treaty redrew the map of Europe by shrinking Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire\" (117)\n\nHere we see the *one treaty to rule them all, one treaty to bind them* taking the place of an entire peacemaking process lasting years. Also the shrinking Germany comment is giving me a bad feeling...\n\n\"Czechoslovakia became a nation, carved out of Southwestern Germany and northern Austro-Hungarian Empire territory\" (117)\n\nDing ding ding! It's our prize quote. Beware, Swabia! The Czechoslavkian nationals are coming for your land. I'm at a loss as to how they reached this claim. I've tried to look it up, maybe I've just had a hole in my knowledge of Czech history? Is this a reference to the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia being thus \"German land\"? Are Gilmore and Sugrue suggesting the Sudetenland is rightful German clay? If so, why would the Sudetenland be considered \"Southwest\" Germany? One can only dream of the answers. At least they got northern Austro-Hungarian territory right, gotta give them credit.\n\n\"the Poles, who had rebelled against Germany in 1918, became an independent country on land formerly in northeastern Germany, as did Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia\" (118)\n\nNo wait my bad *this* is the prize winning quote of the day. In the great alternative universe of Gilmore and Sugrue, German occupation of the Russian Empire involved swift and merciless annexation. The germans also successfully pushed all the way through Estonia! In only 10 days from October 11 to 21, 1917, Germany consolidated control not just of Saaremaa, Hiiumaa, and Muhu, but of Tallinn and Tartu as well! \n\nNone of the history of Eastern Europe is important, anyhow. The good East Europeans came to Chicago to help cut off pigs' heads and the bad ones were left behind and became ~~German subjects~~ commies.\n\nI'd have more passages to rant about, but I'm only a fifth of the way through this book.\n\nBook referenced:\n\nGlenda Gilmore and Thomas Joseph Sugrue, *These United States: A Nation in the Making, 1890 to the Present* (W.W.Norton and Company 2015)",

Sorry folks... \n\n&gt; Nazism, to break it down, means Nazzionalle Socialische, or \"National Socialism\". The early stages of the National Socialist German Worker's Party were in fact extreme-leftist principles about the abolishment of the upper class and the reunification of working industries.\n\nYes, taking the Nazis at their word when they were a relatively small political party trying to attract disaffected, struggling lower-middle class and working-class voters in post-WWI, post-Communist Revolution (both the successful October Revolution in 1917 and the unsuccessful but still quite alarming Communist Revolution in Germany c.1919) is sound history. It’s not like the Nazis ever engaged in propaganda or political opportunism of any sort. \n\n&gt; Hitler's belief in Völkisch equality, which is an establishment of a provisional government Welfare State and the complete abolishment of the Upper Class. This is Socialism, a far-left ideology. Hitler also required the complete turnover of all private property to the proletariat.\n\nThe only somewhat factual thing that I can detect in this paragraph is that Hitler and his fellow Nazis  believed in Aryan/German racial solidarity and class-collaborationism. Which in practice, once the Nazis were in power, turned out to be great business for those noted champions of far-Left Socialism German industrialists and other (non-Jewish) German bourgeois interests. \n\nAnd the last sentence of that paragraph is not only patently false historically, but as it turns out, the living standards of the German working class actually *declined* throughout the 1930s - ie. when the Nazis were in control. Oops.\n\n&gt; Hitler believed in:\n\n&gt; Government-funded abortions\n\n&gt; Government-funded food\n\n&gt; The government supplying the basic needs of life\n\n&gt; Total annihilation of Capitalist principles and Capitalists themselves (including Jews, who were actually more financially successful than others around them during this time).\n\n&gt; Far-left ideologies such as class-equality and social justice, along with the abandonment of private property\n\n&gt; A planned economy with the \"people\" as the ones making economic decisions, not the upper class\n\n&gt; “Equal\" wealth distribution among those deemed racially \"superior\".\n\n&gt; This is exactly why the Nazi's first targeted Jewish Businesses before anyone else. They stereotyped Jews as wealthy capitalists and part of the bourgeoisie. The predecessor to the Nazi Party, called the German Worker's Party, was founded by antisemitists who opposed Jewish Capitalism and also opposed capitalism itself before anything.\n\nI’m really not sure where to start with all of this other than: Jesus Christ that’s a lot of deeply misleading and oversimplified, ripped-from-historical context talking points *at best*. whew \n\nLink: https://www.reddit.com/r/Capitalism/comments/7sjnaf/farright_national_socialism_is_not_rightwing_at/\n\n",

        "text": "Bit of a throw back here but I rewatched bill wurtz's history of Japan video and noticed a bit of outdated information. I know these videos are designed to be concise and entertaining so detail isn't really an issue but he double downed on this one bad part in his follow up video history of the world so figured I'd write a bit of correction.\n\nNow the part I'm taking issue with is when he gets to the end of the Heian period and the rise of the Shogunate government. bill wurtz when explaining this period uses the old fashioned view of the Imperial government that it was more interested in writing poetry, art and courtly affairs then governance. This is what led to the rise of the samurai as the power vacuum left by Imperial indifference allowed the military to take control. This was the prevailing view for many years so its understandable that it would be included in the video. \n\nKarl Friday (historian on Japanese/Samurai history) argues the opposite. Rather then the Samurai coming about filling in a power vaccume and seizing control in a few decades. They were brought about by the Imperial government attempting to increase its control of the country side. The privatization of the military allowed for its quick expansion and its members were mostly made up from nobles of the middle aristocracy and rural areas. Civil and military aristocrats did not view each other any differently and military service was seen as a surefire way of increasing ones own rank. It was only after incremental changes in policy and ebbs and flows of Imperial power that occurred over centuries of development that led to the rise of military power and eventually the Kamakura shogunate.  Two of the Kamakura shogun's were in fact members of the Fujiwara clan which was the leading family during the Heian period and had a monopoly on the position of Imperial Regent. This goes to show how intertwined the members of the court and the military were. \n\n",

        "text": "[This](https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-pop-culture-obsessed-with-battles-between-good-and-evil) was linked in a philosophical(ish) sub that I subscribe to, and in attempting to dispel a comment that was attempting to agree with the article, I clicked on it and read it.\n\nI had no idea what horrors awaited me...\n\n&gt; Virtually all our mass-culture narratives based on folklore have the same structure: good guys battle bad guys for the moral future of society. These tropes are all over our movies and comic books, in Narnia and at Hogwarts, and yet they don’t exist in any folktales, myths or ancient epics.\n\nI mean, this is laughably ridiculous but lets go ahead with the details since we're here, shall we?\n\n&gt; In old folktales, no one fights for values. Individual stories might show the virtues of honesty or hospitality, but there’s no agreement among folktales about which actions are good or bad.\n\nMedieval romance is literally fighting for values.  With swords and shit.  *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight* is over 600 years old, for example.  Everyone (except the author of the linked article?) knows the story by now.  The whole thing is about virtue in the face of adversity even under pain of death, and the conclusion of the story reveals the \"bad guy\" to be Arthur's sister/nemesis Morgan Le Fay, who intended to test knights' virtue and scare the queen to death. (1)\n\n&gt; The ostensibly moral face-off between good and evil is a recent invention that evolved in concert with modern nationalism – and, ultimately, it gives voice to a political vision not an ethical one.\n\nI mean, you don't even have to read the whole thing.  Book one of *Paradise Lost* literally picks up after the armies of Heaven and the armies of Hell have fought a battle, you can't get much more battle of good vs. evil than that...\n\nThe below is from the **second page**...\n\n*\"Who first seduc'd them to that foul revolt? / Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile / Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd \nThe Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride / Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host / Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring / To set himself in Glory above his Peers, / He trusted to have equal'd the most High, If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim / Against the Throne and Monarchy of God / Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud / With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power / Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie / To bottomless perdition, there to dwell / In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, / Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.\"* (2)\n\n&gt; Good guys stand up for what they believe in, and are willing to die for a cause. This trope is so omnipresent in our modern stories, movies, books, even our political metaphors, that it is sometimes difficult to see how new it is, or how bizarre it looks, considered in light of either ethics or storytelling.\n\nThe author is apparently completely unfamiliar with Plato and Socrates as well?  I mean, the dialogue with Crito is precisely about this. Crito implores Socrates to escape his sentence of death, but Socrates refuses because of his respect for the law, which he deems greater than his own life. (3)\n\n&gt; Again, this is a point of pride that seems incoherent in the context of pre-modern storytelling. Not only do people in ancient stories not switch sides in fights but Achilles, say, would never win because his army was composed of the rejects from the Trojans’. In old stories, great warriors aren’t scrappy recruits, there for the moral education: they’re experts.\n\nSo the author hasn't read any Shakespeare either. Jack Falstaff is quite literally a bad warrior present in the story of Henry IV and V for moral education. He's a knight, but abuses his social status to cheat, steal, and defraud. His two claimed 'victories' in battle happen solely due to blind luck, because he couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag.  And his soldiers were in fact, rejects and/or scrappy recruits, since we're on the previous quote...\n\n*PRINCE HENRY (observing Falstaff's recruits for the Battle of Shrewsbury): \"I did never see such pitiful rascals.\"* (4)\n\nThis could go on but I think I've done enough damage and honestly don't want to read the article again.  I don't think I've ever read an article dealing with literary history in which I found every single major point to be wrong, so this one should get some sort of shit prize for idiocy.\n\n1.

        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not claiming Republicans are racist or making any statements about present day politicians or political movements or their adherents.\n\nWell guys, it has come to this once again: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OURy5WFp0zk&amp;t=42s\n\nYes, PragerU isn't so much low hanging fruit as a literal root vegetable, but people take it as fact and so here we stand, gazing into the abyss of dumb videos that drive us to drink.\n\nHowever, I want this to be a bit different than a lot of the **TOP QUALITY CONTENT**™ that we post here at /r/BadHistory. I want this to be an analysis of PragerU as historical propaganda, a category of Bad History all its own. Now, we all enjoy going through PragerU videos and pointing out every little inaccuracy from the epic to the minute; I know that I certainly do. However, it can be absolutely invaluable to dig a bit deeper and examine the things that are categorically true, but where the intent is to deceive the audience by conveying the argument through means such as association or implication. This is propaganda 101: Keep the things you're saying more or less factual, but understand how they will be interpreted by your target audience. It is *that* intended meaning that I wish to look at here today.\n\nBefore we begin we need we need to understand the purpose of this video; what's the argument they are making and what are they trying to accomplish. The basic argument is, \"Republicans are unfairly maligned as being racists and sexists. They are not racists and sexists and this can be demonstrated by their history.\" Keep this in mind, because it's key to understanding the Bad History implicit to the rhetorical devices they employ. This isn't Bad History because it is factually incorrect; it's Bad History because it's disingenuous.\n\nSo, you're probably asking yourself, \"Samuel_I, you old commie, what the hell are you on about? A Bad History post about the implication of something rather than their factual claims! BAH, I SAY.\" Well, your trepidation is understandable, so let's demonstrate via a simple example from the video. At [1:10](https://youtu.be/OURy5WFp0zk?t=1m10s) in the video the narrator states, \"**in 1860, just six weeks after the election of the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, South Carolina, a state dominated by Democrats, voted to secede from the Union. The Civil War that followed was the bloodiest war in US history. It led to the passage, by Republicans, of the 13th Amendment which freed the slaves, the 14th Amendment which gave them citizenship, and the 15th Amendment which gave them the vote.**\" Now, you'll notice that everything she says here is, in fact, historically accurate, if oversimplified. To a person not looking a step below the surface, that can seem pretty unobjectionable. The Bad History comes in from the implications present in the historical facts she emphasizes, the historical facts she omits, the words she chooses, the structure of her sentences, and how this all relates to the purpose of the video.\n\nLincoln, *the First Republican President* carries the association of the Great Emancipator in the public consciousness, thus invoking him brings those associations to the front. The audience is meant to understand that Lincoln freed the slaves, freeing the slaves isn't something a racist would do, he was a Republican, therefore Republicans weren't racist, therefore Republicans aren't racist. The same is true for the Republicans being the ones that brought about the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, or the Democrats being the ones to secede and start the Civil War. The point here isn't to illuminate the historical record, but rather to cherry pick bits of it out of context and rely on association/implication to do the rest. It smacks of white nationalist rhetoric that proclaims things like, \"The American Indians didn't even invent the wheel!\" Well, yes, that's true, but at the same time does that really lead to the conclusion that you're putting forth and is that really the point of _why_ you're saying it? Thus we reach a point where you can commit Bad History without even saying anything expressly false.\n\nEven still, it doesn't take a particularly stringent analysis to see some holes. In fact, the reality is that many Republicans of the time were racists or espoused racist views (as we would understand them today, which is the point of the video), [including Lincoln himself at various points](https://www.snopes.com/did-lincoln-racism-equality-oppose/). And while it is true that Democrats were the party of the South/slaveholders/segregationists, we can't remove that from the historical context of the time in an attempt to win political points in the here and now. Furthermore, we need to recognize that labels, institutions, and even people change over time. What was seen as racist in 1873 is going to be different from what people would call racist in 1973. And this isn't even touching the understanding of racism as institutionalized racism from a sociological perspective. \n\nAnyway, I hope this has been an educational process that helps illuminate the ways disingenuous actors will attempt to work Bad History into the conversation to force a narrative about the past to influence the present day.\n\nAs an aside, that's all bad enough, but the real cherry on top is that according to the video, history just pulled a Fukuyama and just stopped in 1964. Yeah, no need to worry about Strom Thurmond becoming a Republican or anything, but /u/mscott734 already has a good post on their [video on the Southern Strategy](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7q5u6b/prager_u_doesnt_understand_why_hoover_was_elected/) and I recommend you check that out.\n\nEdit: a grammar",

        "text": "I'm a little late with this one, but I wanted to do a quick write-up of SciShow's episode on [the AI gaming revolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhec39dVGDE0). Specifically the line, \"[Go is] a Chinese game that has existed unchanged for thousands of years.\"\n\nNow, this is going to be *very* nitpicky, but the rules have changed somewhat. While there is evidence (see [here](http://gobase.org/reading/history/china/) and [here](https://senseis.xmp.net/?GoHistory)) that the majority of the [rules of Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_Go#Concise_statement) are very old, some rules have changed and there is plenty of variation between different modern tournaments. The main rules that have been changed are:\n\n1) [The Scoring System](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Scoring). This can get a little technical, but there are two modern methods for scoring games. The basic question is do you count captured stones or living stones as points? The difference is often minor. Typically the methods are not different at all, occasionally one point different, and silly examples exist for more than one point difference. However, older methods could be quite different, such as the [\"Stone Scoring\"](https://senseis.xmp.net/?StoneScoring) method from the Ming dynasty that effectively imposed a 1-point [\"group tax.\"](https://senseis.xmp.net/?GroupTax)\n\n2) [Komi](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Komi), which are points given to the second player to balance the game. Figuring out a proper Komi is a major question in modern Go. However, considering how central Komi is to modern tournament play, it may be surprising that Komi wasn't widely used in tournaments until [1925](https://senseis.xmp.net/?HistoryOfKomi)! There are other methods of balancing the game, such as [handicap stones](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Handicap) or alternating black and white that were used instead.\n\n3) [Ko rules](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Ko), which prevent infinite loops of players capturing each other's stones. For much of Go's history the [\"weak\" ko rule](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Ko) was popular. This prevents players from capturing back and forth one after the other. However, it is possible to construct cycles of capturing that are still infinite without violating this rule. Stronger ko rules have been used to prevent this, such as the popular [superko](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Superko) rule, suggested as far back as 1929, that prohibits any previous board state from repeating. Other old variants exist, including [Tibetan Ko](https://senseis.xmp.net/?TibetanGo), which prevents strategies such as [snapback](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Snapback).\n\n4) The size of the board. This one might not be \\/r/badhistory so much as \\/r/inconsistentdefinitions, because the currently standard 19x19 boards did exist at least as far back as the Han in 200 AD. But other board sizes were and remain popular, especially the 17x17 board size.\n\nAdditional point: this is more of an \\/r/badmathematics complaint, but I want to nitpick the statement also found in the video that the Go board is especially big because you play on the grid corners, thus making the grid effectively four times bigger. This is very much untrue, as those grid corners are shared between neighboring grid spaces so this multiple of four dramatically overcounts the number of positions. Furthermore, Go board sizes are named after the number of grid points just like chess board sizes are named after the number of spaces. Thus, a \"19x19\" Go board only has 18x18 spaces. Whether you play on the points or the spaces is really just a (0.5, 0.5) translation, for any lattice-nerds reading this.\n\nIn summary, the rules of Go have changed somewhat during the past 2000+ years, and there remain regional variations to this day. I'm not sure that any of these rule changes would dramatically affect the way you program an AI, but they are changes to the rules, so the game was not entirely \"unchanged.\"",

        "text": "I'll pretty much c/p a comment I made in the r/videos thread.  \n\n  I made a small comment about some small problems I had with the video but even looking up basic facts I found there was a lot wrong with what the video said.  I kept adding to the comment as I realized just how wrong the video was  and now there might be enough to warrant a post here lol. I don't watch too many since I don't enjoy them but from what I've seen this might be the most inaccurate extra credits video they've made.  \n\nI can't find the askhistorians thread that talked about the pirate queen but I did remember the Portuguese beating the fleet and forcing surrender. For sources I directly used [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Tiger%27s_Mouth) to double check what I remembered from the askhistorians thread. Also thought [this](https://www.headstuff.org/history/ching-shih-and-cheung-po-tsai-pirate-monarchs/) article was well done\n\nI'm open to being wrong about my comment but do think the video has some flaws just based on established fact. \n A problem for me was that quite a few resources I read linked a Chinese source I can't read. \n\nMy Comment in [this thread\n](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7tfexk/cheng_i_sao_the_chinese_pirate_queen/)\n***\nHonestly this is badhistory that ignores what really happened with the surrender of the fleet\n\n\nThe video really underplays the role of the Portuguese and overplays the pirates being strong and wise.  The video says that  \n&gt;the red fleet would find itself simulaniusly fighting imperial forces, old allies, and western ships\n\nShe was fighting western navies but they were *the* major factor as she lost battles to them and I think the way its presented is badhistory.  Also misleading about the amnesty as the video gives the impression they had foresight and negotiated from a position of strength when really it was arguably a solid offer by the Imperial government to vulnerable (but still powerful) pirates.  I find this especially annoying because there are a bunch of articles on the internet by shitty websites that have an agenda when talking about the pirate queen and essentially make up the story you hear with this video.  Even wiki level articles mention stuff this video ignores or glosses over, you don't need to be an expert to get this right.  \n\nPortuguese with 3-6 ships (depends on the encounter) took on the red flag fleet and won.  Three engagements total one in September 1809, one in November, and one that lasted December to January. .  3-6 Portugese ships with max 750 crew took on  300-700 of these pirate ships with over 30,000 crew. Cheung Po Tsai was in command as Cheng Sao was not a commander herself even if she formally led the pirates. (keep in mind fleets often kept family on board so numbers aren't all pirate men).  The video only really mentions the November meeting and fails to talk about the Dec-Jan encounter that really led to the end of the red fleet.  Its honestly really poor history to ignore than and skip ahead.  \n\nCheung sent offers of peace to the Portuguese which they refused.  After the last battle the Pirates retreated up the river where the Portuguese couldn't follow and were blockaded in.  Eventually Cheung was convinced to surrender under favorable conditions to the Chinese Emperor.  This is just completly ignored by the video. \n\nThat's not to say that Cheng wasn't a remarkable woman who really overcame shitty odds to be a major player but I do find that in trying to pump her tires people overlook Cheung as he was really a joint successor.  Just like historically they overlooked Cheng because she was a woman and assumed the man led the partnership, the opposite is true in videos like this.  The historiography of the two are interesting as depending on agenda/assumptions one or the other is played up.  I would say that in modern times the idea of a super powerful \"pirate queen\" is the dominant narrative and Cheung is a relegated to side kick despite actually leading the fleet in command.  It was much more similar to the relationship the video described with her first husband.  \n\n&gt;as cheng's life wained the british stepped up to the fault lines she had exposed\n\nAlso the idea that Cheng Sao showed weakness that allowed the British to come in and exploit the Chinese is to my understanding bullshit.  The Portuguese had already shown the disparity in naval power that the British would exploit, that had little to do with pirate fleets (although it was an example of Imperial weakness).  Not to mention it was 30 years later the Opium wars started.  Imperial weakness may have continued but Cheng was not the reason the British saw weakness.  \n\nBut hey considering the channel doesn't properly cite things or respond to being proven wrong in the past I can't say I expected much from them.  \n\nedit: interesting aspect that still plays to women being influential is that one of the strengths of the fleet was that a wife of Cheung's lieutenant spoke English and was an expert in western weaponry.  Which allowed connections that helped strengthen them.\n\n***\n\nHonestly I'm usually on the fence for pop history badhistory but this is so erroneously wrong and misleading I really do think it would have been better if the video had not been made (which is not something I would say about plenty of other similar videos).  I never really held extra credits in high regard but I do know people who watch their videos and its sad they thought this was appropriate to make.  \n\nDespite causing the fall of the Roman empire I'm kind of a fan of women being empowered but that's no excuse to ignore historical fact for the sake of getting an invincible pirate queen to flaunt as an example of \"girl power\" (not to mention the truth is still her being badass).  If you Look up Cheng Sao you see articles like the one in Huffington post that is basically agenda driven nonsense where you can see the motivation of furthering a particular narrative.  My guess is that the creators just used these popular sources instead of actually doing any real research into the topic.  ",

        "text": "In a [post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7svvbo/altright_blogger_does_some_questionable_number/?st=jcvg6arw&amp;sh=2eb66636) yesterday, I responded to white nationalist blogger Ryan Faulk’s shoddy calculations of the death toll during the Congo Free State.\n\nPicking up where we left off, in the remainder of Faulk’s article, he tries to either minimize the atrocities or to absolve Leopold and the Belgian authorities of any blame. \n\nBut first, I would like to offer some more background on Faulk to provide an idea of who we’re dealing with here. He subscribes to an extreme biological determinist position through which he views not only history but practically every other social phenomenon.  On his site, he lays out his philosophy, which he refers to as “First Worldism.”\n\n&gt; First Worldism is the view that the policy stances and government outcomes we classify as “first world” and “third world” are a function of population genetics. The “first world” peoples are primarily, though not exclusively, European, with minorities of other races having people who have, on aggregate, genetic predispositions to first-world traits.  \n\n\n&gt; First-world traits are:\n\n\n&gt; * anti-authoritarian views of knowledge and truth,\n&gt; * a lower level of social sensitivity, conformity and consensus-seeking\n&gt; * support for free speech\n&gt; * opposition to heavy government intervention and regulating of private property (i.e. the consensus-economies of West, Central, South, Southeast and East Asia), support for free markets\n&gt; * lower crime, higher diligence and self-control, higher IQs.\n&gt; * less interest in grievance politics and bloc-politics\n\n\n#Argument 1: Leopold didn’t have control of the whole Congo\n\nFaulk first argues that the Belgium regime didn’t have effective control over the entire region for the whole period of the Congo Free State, so it can’t be responsible for all the deaths. He cites a statement by the Belgian embassy in London issued in response to a BBC documentary. \n\n&gt; Finally, the cultivation of rubber was geographically restricted to the equatorial rainforest around the northern Congo basin and to a lesser extent to the Kasai region (totalling one fifth of Congo’s territory). The estimated 10 million deaths for the whole of Congo cannot be ascribed to the Belgians, simply because at the beginning of the colonisation, they were not even present or active in the whole of Congo.\n\nBut this doesn’t really hold up to scrutiny. As noted in the previous post, population was likely dense around the Congo River and its basin area, i.e. the area under Leopold’s effective control for the longest time. The reason Stanley’s original population estimate of 26 million is considered unreliable is that he used estimates of population density around the river, which were much higher, to calculate the population of the interior.\n\nFurthermore, the worst abuses occurred in the 1890s after new inventions caused the price of rubber to skyrocket. At the same time, the Congo Free State was building railroads and expanding its control over the interior.  The CFS also engaged in [military conflicts]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lado_Enclave) beyond the territory of its nominal control. \n\n#Argument 2: The CFS lacked the manpower to kill that many\n\nHere Faulk tries to argue that the relatively small size of the CFS bureaucracy and military forces is sufficient evidence it is implausible that so many people could have died under the regime. This is reminiscent of a tactic of Holocaust denial. The scale of the atrocity is so unimaginable that it’s deemed impossible prima facie. \n\nFirst he looks at the [Force Publique]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Publique), Leopold’s private army made up of African soldiers and \n\n&gt; If we average the size of the FP in 1892 and 1908, we get 15,450 men in the FP at any one time. And with 3.286 tours of duty, this means that there were roughly 50,769 men in the FP during the entirely of Leopold’s rule.\n&gt; This translates to roughly 197 men killed for each member of the FP in order to reach 10 million kills. This seems like an extremely dubious figure.\n\nFaulk is arguing against a straw man here. The mainstream position isn’t that CFS security forces killed 10 million but that this number died as a direct or indirect result of Belgian rule. Many of these deaths were due to starvation and disease. \n\n\nBut these factors can’t be considered acts of god, exculpating the Belgian regime. Agriculture suffered as laborers died or were redirected from food production to meet unrealistic rubber quotas. Starvation and exhaustion weakened immune systems and raised mortality while displacement accelerated the spread of infectious disease as formerly immobile populations were forced to relocate.\n\n\nIn a report on a more recent conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the International Rescue Committee observes that only 0.4 percent of the estimated 5.4 million casualties is directly attributable to violence: “the majority of deaths have been due to infectious diseases, malnutrition and neonatal- and pregnancy-related conditions”\n\nBut just for the sake of argument, let’s look at the number that Faulk considers so “dubious:” 197 deaths per soldier. \n\nIn “Congo: The Epic History of a People,” Belgian historian David Van Reybrouck notes the exceptional cruelty of the infamous Belgian commander Leon Fievez. In his first four months of service alone, he was responsible for punitive expeditions that killed 572 people. In one expedition, he oversaw the looting and burning of more than 160 villages in a matter of days. Over the course of the expedition, nearly 1,350 people were killed and crops were destroyed. Van Reybrouck also notes that Fievez had the most profitable operation in the region.\n\nFurthermore, focusing solely on the regular army overlooks some of the main sources of violence. The coercive apparatus of the rubber industry was supplemented by irregular local forces. Some of the worst atrocities happened within the territory of concessionary companies like the Anglo-Belgian India Rubber company (ABIR). The company adopted a [post system]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abir_Congo_Company#Post_system) under which a couple of European administrators extracted rubber from the populace using a local militia of 60-100 sentries made up from native Congolese or former slaves.\n\nAnd because severed hands were accepted in lieu of tax, some Congolese would fight small wars with each other just to make up the difference in their unreasonably high rubber quotas.\n\n#Argument 3: Lack of documentation\n\nHere Faulk argues that there is a lack of adequate documentation. And he’s right, if you ignore a mountain of eyewitness accounts by journalists, missionaries, diplomats and reformers. He shrugs off the claim that Belgian officials might have destroyed records.\n\n\n&gt; On issue historians face when condemning Leopold II is a lack of documentation; even a BBC documentary blithely accused Leopold of destroying the relevant records. It’s not a charge that is easy to respond to; how does one prove that no records were destroyed?\n\n\nWhile you can’t prove a negative, there is evidence that official records from the era were destroyed coming from an eyewitness in the administration. In chapter 19 of “King Leopold’s Ghost” titled “The Great Forgetting” (p. 293), Horschild gives an account of a military aide to the king who witnessed the large-scale incineration of records in 1908 shortly before the handover of the free state from Leopold to the Belgian government.  According to the aide, Gustave Stinglhamber, the king said “I will give them my Congo, but they have no right to know what I did there.”\nNext, Faulk argues that the existing evidence implicates the native forces:\n\n\n&gt; But it shouldn’t matter, because from 1904 to 1908, in response to public outcry over the Congo, an independent council created by Italy, Switzerland and Belgium conducted an ongoing investigation and released periodical reports called The Official Bulletin of the Congo Free State.\n\n\n&gt; Of course this council did not report extreme genocide going at the behest of Leopold’s government. In fact, they reported that the abuses occurred almost exclusively when FP detachments were sent out WITHOUT a European commander, and that the presence of European commanders was what prevented atrocities and rape.\n\n&gt; (It is interesting to read these bulletins and see just how matter-of-fact they are about it; it’s just assumed that blacks will rape unless kept in order by whites.)\n\nSo what we have here is a perversion of the Nuremburg Defense. The officers, who were entirely European, aren’t held responsible for their soldiers who didn’t follow orders. But most historians argue that the Commission of Inquiry report corroborates most other accounts of the atrocities, especially the sentry system under ABIR. \n\nTheir account doesn’t absolve the Belgian officers so much as it reveals the colonialist bias of those compiling the report who are incredulous that their fellow Europeans could be implicated in such barbarity, so they blame it on a combination of poor white oversight and the unchecked “sanguinary impulses” of the natives. The Belgian commanders would issue euphemistic orders, like “remind them of their duty,” so either the soldiers misinterpreted this or it’s far more likely that they knew exactly what was expected and acted accordingly. \n\n&gt; “The order given to the commanding officer of a detachment was generally expressed in the following way: “so and so is instructed to punish or chastise such and such a village.\" The Commission knows of several expeditions of this type the results of which were frequently murderous. One cannot be astonished at it. For in the course of delicate operations which have for their **purpose the taking of hostages and the intimidating of natives a supervision is not always possible to hold in check the sanguinary instinct of the black**, for when the order of punishment comes from a superior authority it is very hard to keep the expedition from assuming the character of a massacre accompanied by pillage and the destruction of property. Military action of this character always exceeds its purpose, the punishment being out of proportion to the fault. \n\nThis line of reasoning is mind-boggling. It’s essentially saying that the Belgian authorities can’t be held liable e when the very purpose of the expedition is to coerce labor out of a group of people by brute force. How are those who gave the order somehow less culpable in the act merely because of overzealousness on the part of those who carried it out?\n\nWhen discussing the mutilations, the Commission similarly denies that any white men took part. But other accounts contradict this narrative. Leon Rom, a Belgian officer who is said to be the model for Joseph Conrad’s Kurtz, was reported by journalist and explorer Edward Glave to have gallows in his front yard and decorated his flower beds with two dozen severed heads. \n\nA Catholic priest relayed an account of the aforementioned commander Leon Fievez given by a local man:\n\n&gt; All blacks saw this man as the devil of the Equator...From all the bodies killed in the field, you had to cut off the hands. He wanted to see the number of hands cut off by each soldier, who had to bring them in baskets...A village which refused to provide rubber would be completely swept clean. As a young man, I saw [Fiévez's] soldier Molili, then guarding the village of Boyeka, take a net, put ten arrested natives in it, attach big stones to the net, and make it tumble into the river...Rubber causes these torments; that's why we no longer want to hear its name spoken. Soldiers made young men kill or rape their own mothers and sisters\n\nFaulk then makes another dishonest argument that since mutilation wasn’t written down in official policy that it wasn’t widespread, condoned or encouraged by the regime\n\n&gt; And in terms of mutilation – chopping off hands and feet – there is zero documentation that that was Leopold’s policy, nor did the investigation find any evidence that it was Leopold’s policy. In fact, the investigation claimed that this was done by indigenous members of the FP, particularly when a European officer was absent.\n\nIt’s true there wasn’t much official policy of any kind, and that was a huge problem. Officials had limitless discretion and a mandate to maximize profit, so the practice was widespread, particularly as a means to prevent expensive ammunition from being wasted on hunting. As Van Reybrouck notes:\n\n&gt; At various places, therefore, there arose the practice of cutting off the right hand of those they had shot and taking it along as proof of what the bullet had been used for… During the debriefing [the tax collector] was expected to present the hands as pieces justificatives—as receipts for expenses incurred.\n\nNext Faulk questions the practice on the basis that it is intuitively impractical.\n&gt; In addition, chopping off limbs seems to be a ridiculous policy given that the biggest problem Leopold had was a labor shortage. It is also known that limb mutilation had occurred both before and after the Congo Free State – and without any reliable statistics, there’s no way to know if it even increased during the Congo Free State.\n\nAgain, he echoes Holocaust deniers who point to the absurd waste of manpower to carry out the genocide so they are skeptical that the Nazi regime would rationally decide to devote resources to such an undertaking during wartime. It’s an attempt to apply rationality to an inherently irrational act of mass murder.\n\n\nA lot of the mutilations and executions weren’t of adult laborers but of their children, who were frequently taken hostage and/or subjected to rape and torture. And as the case of Fievez illustrates, the most brutal and deadly operations were also the most profitable. So there’s nothing to say that high death tolls or mutilations can’t coexist with high productivity.\n\nAnd while the practice of chopping off hands as a trophy in warfare might have existed prior to the free state, it wasn’t regularized into some barbaric form of bookkeeping by a state that exists to extract profit through naked violence on an industrial scale.\n\n#Argument 4: Denying Black agency\n\nHere Faulk makes one of his most disingenuous arguments by accusing those who assign blame to Leopold of infantilizing the people of the Congo.\n\n\n&gt; There are two more important facts to consider. The first is that there were roughly 200 Europeans in the Congo Free State administration at any one time, versus around 13,000  black FP troops at any one time. And so the mutilating, raping and killing that was done had to have been done overwhelmingly by the black FP troops.\n\n&gt; Now at the time, the Belgians blamed Leopold II for what the black FP troops were doing because they viewed blacks as “half-devil and half-child”; and whites were responsible for their action in the same way a dog owner is responsible for a dog’s action.\n\n&gt; “Sure, the blacks did the killing, but they’re YOUR responsibility. Blacks do what blacks do.”\n\n&gt; Modern day white “liberals” would of course be aghast at such thinking. But it creates a problem for intellectual consistency, they’re condemning Leopold for a standard that treats blacks as pets for whom the owner is to be in charge of and responsible for.\n\nHis dog analogy misrepresents the entire notion of chain-of-command that forms the basis of military organization. A soldier is not a dog. Individual agency aside, soldiers operate on orders. No one in their right mind would argue that when Belgian officers sent their soldiers out on punitive expeditions, they were totally ignorant of what they would or did do. And if they were ignorant, then they’re just as culpable for exercising lax oversight.\nAnd he’s lying about the number of Belgians. Records show that the Belgian population alone was 1,500 not counting other white European representatives of concessionary companies from different countries.\n\n#Argument 5: Propaganda\n\nFinally, Faulk ventures into flat-out denial, arguing—again without evidence— that Leopold’s critics misrepresented the regime by exaggerating the atrocities:\n\n&gt; And so if a dishonest or ignorant newspaper editor got some pictures or description of a battle in that war, he would have plenty of gory pictures and gruesome details, and he could then say, “this is Leopold’s Congo” to dishonestly seed the idea that this was normal Congo Free State policy for all Congolese.\n&gt; In addition, if say some men in the FP chopped off the hands of 20 people, well, 20 images can fill up an entire page, and would make it look like mutilation is happening all the time; and he could then say, “this is Leopold’s Congo”.\n&gt; You could then show the horrible hospitals, dirty and lacking supplies, without the context that this was actually an improvement over the “folk medicine” of the Congolese. But just images of the horrible hospital conditions, and then say “this is Leopold’s Congo”.\n\nBut the evidence isn’t just a few pictures. Much of it comes from eyewitness accounts of Protestant missionaries from all over the world. At the time, Leopold accused the Protestants of libeling the Catholic Belgians but even Catholic newspapers in Belgium and elsewhere reported the atrocities. And for a person with nothing to hide, Leopold went to great lengths to [harass and silence his critics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Free_State_propaganda_war)\n\n#”The Alternative Hypothesis?”\n\nMost of his final summary just rehashes the points that have already been refuted in detail, so I’ll just focus on a couple.\n\n&gt; Leopold’s Congo did not have any form of population statistics. And so there is no record of how many people died in the Congo; this makes it easy for people to pull numbers out of there. Moreover, it is the Congo, it is a place where people die all the time for horrible reasons and live in conditions that Europeans even at that time would consider torture. 200 Belgian administrators are not going to change that.\n\nSo here he’s massively downplaying the extent to which a colonial regime can exacerbate existing phenomena, like disease and starvation.\n\n&gt; The rubber quota was just a form of taxation. In fact, throughout history, labor rendered to the state was the most common way in which people paid taxes, since most people didn’t have currency. And that is how most of the Congolese paid their taxes, and Leopold’s policy was that no man’s tax should be over 40 hours per month.\n\nThe difference being is that with taxation, one usually gets something out of it in the form of public goods like education or infrastructure. The Congolese got nothing and had much taken from them. They were dispossessed of their land, which was nationalized and made the private property of Leopold. Their condition was in many ways worse than slavery because a slave master at least had some obligation to look after the well-being of his property. The CFS and its concessions were only concerned with how much value they could extract, and would do so by any means necessary.\n\nAnd I’ve never heard of a case where the IRS took a person’s family hostage and mutilated them because they didn’t pay enough taxes. Also, the rubber quotas were set by central authorities without consideration of local conditions, such as the number of laborers in a village, so they were in almost all cases impossible to meet.\n\nAs for the reforms limiting work to 40 hours, if they were even implemented at all in practice, they were done so only after the commission’s report in 1904 or possibly not even until the Belgian Congo period in 1908. Some historians have noted that despite the supposed reforms, it was business as usual in the Congo well after the Congo Free State period since the personnel did not change at all.\n\n&gt; In terms of cutting off limbs, that was a practice that predates and postdates Leopold’s Congo. In addition, several of the photos of Africans with limbs chopped off have Europeans posing with them; do you imagine that they would pose with them if they had done it themselves? Do you think they would want to take photos because they were proud of doing that themselves?\n\nAgain, Faulk is severely misrepresenting the facts. The Europeans he mentions posing with the severed limbs were missionaries trying to sound the alarm about the horrors of the Congo not colonial officials.\n\n&gt; And activists, looking for a flashy number, say “10 million” and quickly cobble together imagery, anecdotes and personal accounts, without doing the first level of research and ask “is this possible” or try to figure out if indicators of past population showed a decline or increase in population over the period.\n&gt; A similar thing happened in Britain during the industrial revolution as politicians learned of the frightful conditions of factories, ignorant of the fact that it was an improvement of the even more frightful conditions of peasant life.\n&gt; At least that is one alternative hypothesis.\n\n\nSo Faulk ends by insulting the work of historians who have devoted much of their lives to these questions and have done much more than “first-level research.” He concludes with the standard assumption that colonialism was a net benefit to the colonized comparable to the Industrial Revolution and that somehow the lives of the Congolese people were made better or unaffected by displacement and a cruel regime of forced labor.\n\nThe Congo Free State was a great pyramid of suffering and exploitation with King Leopold at the apex. In the absence of oversight or firm rule of law in an environment where brutality was incentivized, large-scale violence was inevitable. The losses incurred in the initial period, when the main source of income was ivory, drove the worst excesses in the rubber boom of the 1890s. Local officials were taken off salaries and put on a commission system based on rubber output, which motivated them to unimaginable cruelty out of self-interest.\n",

        "author": "RedHermit1982",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7svvbo/altright_blogger_does_some_questionable_number/",
        "text": "For those of you who are unfamiliar with [Ryan Faulk]( https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ryan_Faulk), he is a “race realist” blogger who operates the Alternative Hypothesis website and its affiliated Youtube channel. Faulk is widely known throughout alt-right circles because he has compiled a fairly exhaustive set of research papers on his website, which is frequently linked to in discussions on race on reddit and elsewhere. \n\nFaulk is a layman with no known education or training in any of the fields he writes about, but he often adopts the trappings of scientific method, giving his propaganda the patina of credibility. In addition to promoting racist pseudoscience on subjects like race and IQ, Faulk occasionally dabbles in historical revisionism, challenging the mainstream view on historical phenomena, such as slavery and segregation.\n\nTypical of Faulk’s approach is his article “Mythologies About Leopold’s Congo Free State.” In it, he tries to raise doubts about the population decline during the Congo Free State period lasting from 1885 to 1908 while also downplaying the culpability of Leopold II and Belgian officials in the atrocities that occurred when the Congo was under their stewardship. \n\nThough the number of people who died under Leopold’s rule is a highly controversial question— estimates range from 1 million to 15 million—the brutality of the forced labor regime is beyond dispute. The number of dead is a legitimate historical question, and it’s justifiable to scrutinize higher estimates given that the lack of evidence makes it practically unanswerable. \n\nHistorians have spent decades in search of an answer, consulting available records, genealogies and eyewitness accounts but apparently Faulk thinks he can achieve the impossible in an afternoon of googling, skimming papers and crunching numbers using laughably bad methodologies.\n\n##Dubious demography\n\nRather than take the obvious route of apologetics and acknowledge that the population decline happened but that it was largely due to disease, so the Belgians can’t be faulted, Faulk tries desperately to prove that it was impossible and that the population at the time of the establishment of the Congo Free State was less than 10 million. Maybe this wunderkind has stumbled upon some technique that has thus far eluded even the most renowned professional historians?\n\nThe entire article is a response to Adam Hochschild’s book *King Leopold’s Ghost.* Right off the bat, he reduces Hochschild to a straw man:\n\n&gt; Hochschild makes two key claims in his book:\n\n\n&gt; 1. Roughly 10 million people were killed **by agents of the state** in Leopold’s Congo\n&gt; 2. Roughly half of the population of Leopold’s Congo were killed\n \nHochschild never said that all the deaths were directly attributable to violence by “agents of the state.” Instead, he and other historians argue that the deaths were due to a mixture of violence, starvation, disease and lower birth rates, though many of those factors were inextricably linked with the Belgian regime.\n\nThen Faulk lays out his plan of attack:\n\n&gt;  Now the first thing to consider is – is this possible? Well I see three things that need to be established for these claims to be possible:\n\n&gt; 1. The population of the Congo\n&gt; 2. The extent of Leopold’s rule within the Congo\n&gt; 3. The number of Leopold’s Agents who engaged in killing\n\nFrom there, Faulk proceeds to estimate the Congo’s population using a series of methods that are increasingly unreliable. His first method is to take an estimate of the aggregate population of Sub-Saharan Africa in 1885, or “black Africa” as he calls it, and then calculate the population density, which he then applies to the area of the Congo to arrive at a population of 9.8 million in 1885. He does a similar song and dance to get a figure of 10.7 million in 1900.\n\nThere are a few obvious problems with this methodology. First, the estimates for the African population are as disputed as the figures for the Congo, and for the same reason: lack of accurate census records. They vary by as much as 50 million. Here he uses an estimate of an estimate, assuming a linear relationship between the 1850 population estimate of 111 million and the 1900 estimate of 133 million to arrive at 126 million in 1880. \n\nIt’s curious that he doesn’t use the much higher estimates made by University of Pittsburgh historian Patrick Manning, whom Faulk later cites. Manning gives a mid-range estimate of 150 million for 1850, which— using the growth rate of 0.25 percent assumed in the paper—yields an aggregate African population of 163.125 million in 1885. Using Faulk’s method, the population estimate of the Congo would have to be revised upward to 12.73 million.  Note: I’m not endorsing this figure. I’m just illustrating how problematic it is to estimate the population this way. With just minor tweaks to these assumptions, you could easily come up with 20 million or whatever figure you want, making these calculations worthless.\n\nFurthermore, even if the aggregate population figures for Africa were 100 percent accurate, it still would be absurd to use the average estimated population density of Sub-Saharan Africa to draw conclusions about the population of the Congo. \n\nFor various reasons, mostly related to geography, population density across Africa varies wildly.  It’s pretty much a universal constant that settlement patterns in pre-industrial societies tracked water resources, especially rivers, which were necessary for irrigation and transportation prior to the arrival of other forms of transportation. So without throwing out any figures, I think it is safe to assume that the population density of the Congo Free State, which encompassed the entire basin of Africa’s second-longest river, could be expected to be considerably higher than the average.\n\nThen Faulk moves on to the [aforementioned paper](http://www.manning.pitt.edu/pdf/2010.AfricanPopulation.pdf) by Manning, which is attempting to assess the demographic impact of the slave trade. Manning’s method is to look at more recent and reliable 20th century estimates of population and to work backwards based on an assumed default growth rate with rough adjustments for estimated effects of the individual circumstances of each. He uses India’s growth rates for that period—0.2 to 0.3 percent—and then sets modifiers for each region.\n\nFaulk uses Manning’s estimate for the Loango slave trade region, which includes all of the CFS as well as parts of Cameroon and all of Uganda. The estimate for 1850 is about 7.5 million from which Faulk derives an estimate of 8.5 million in 1885, and then he arbitrarily subtracts 1.5 million (I’m guessing he made another crude estimate of the population of the territories not included in the CFS).\n\nBut a closer look reveals a problem with Manning’s methodology: it ignores the peculiar impact of the CFS regime and applies some standard adjustments that appear to vastly underestimate the demographic effect. So starting with a default growth rate of 0.3 percent, it’s adjusted for three factors: slaving disorder (-0.2), slaving exchanges (+/-0.3) and post-slavery recovery (+0.4). So the adjustment applied would range from -0.1 to 0.5. \n\nBut if other modifications are added to account for known phenomena in the CFS—colonial disorder (-0.4), and epidemic and famine (-0.5)—you get a negative growth rate of around -0.7. There were documented outbreaks of sleeping sickness, smallpox and swine flu, and the regime diverted labor from agriculture to rubber extraction, exacerbating famine. \n\nIt's likely the effect of \"colonial disorder\" would be greater because of factors, like displacement, that affect birth rates. Leopold declared most of the property in the Congo to be his personal fiefdom. Entire villages were leveled to make rubber plantations.   And given that the CFS was extraordinarily cruel even by the standards of colonial regimes of the day, a growth rate of -2.0, i.e. what would be necessary to reduce the population by half during the period, is at the very least plausible.\n\nThe next figure Faulk produces also doesn’t come from historians attempting to answer the specific question of the Congo’s population. I suspect it’s because none of the historians who do this kind of research yield answers he likes, so he goes spelunking in the appendices of obscure reports. He derives the unlikely figure of 4.1 million for the Congo in 1900, which is about half of what most historians estimate.\n\nFaulk realizes this is off, so he applies yet another pseudoscientific methodology comparing the estimates in the table for other countries with other estimates to estimate how off the figure is by multiplying it against the average percent difference.\n\n&gt; Now the G-B results are, on average, 98.2% as large as the results from wikipedia, and they are on median 91.5% as large as wikipedia. And so to harmonize G-B’s Congo result with the wikipedia result, we can divide the Congo number by the average ratio and the median ratio.\n\n&gt; In addition, just to get an idea of the maximum discrepancy, we can see that G-B’s number for Nigeria is only 0.27 of the wiki number, and if the G-B Congo number was divided by this, this would give an estimated population of the Congo of 15.196 million in 1900. Now we don’t know if G-B is in error of if the government records are in error for Nigeria in 1900; I think that G-B is in error.  \n\n\nSo Faulk acknowledges the numbers are wrong, but proceeds to treat them as reliable enough to support his argument.\n\n\n&gt; Whatever you think of the G-B numbers, it is important to note that they estimated an increase in the population of the Congo from 1890 to 1910. Now by their method of estimating past population, they may very well be massively undercounting the Congo, which I think they are. Maybe it has something to do with the jungle climate erasing evidence of past agriculture more than other climates do, I don’t know.\n&gt; But they still showed growth in the Congo population for most of the period of the Congo Free State\n\n\nFaulk concludes with some really bad math:\n\n\n&gt; And so if there was a massive genocide, it appears to have been lower than the natural population growth rate. The population growth rate of the Congo from 1950 to 2016 has been around 2.8%. This results in a doubling roughly every 27 years. G-B’s estimate for year on-year growth averages to 2.3%.\n&gt; Now if the doubling rate from 1890 to 1950 wasn’t 27 years, but 30 years, then we would retrodict the population of the Congo to be 3 million in 1890.\n\n\nThe annual population growth rate is calculated using a simple formula: percent change over time divided by the number of years. \n\nAt a rate of 2.8 percent, a population would double in 35 years not 27, and at 2.3 percent, it would double in 43.5 years not 30. **Correction: As a reader pointed out, I made an error here by using a linear method to estimate growth rate, when I should have used logarithmic growth for population. But to prevent any further errors caused by my bad math, I double checked Faulk's calculations using an online [population growth calculator](http://www.endmemo.com/algebra/populationgrowth.php) and found that growth from 3 million in 1890 to 10 million, when a census was taken in 1924, would require a highly implausible growth rate of 3.5 percent and the doubling time would be 19.5 years.** \n\nThere’s no point in even crunching these numbers because the 2.3 percent growth figure is useless since it doesn’t come from a reliable source and it's inconsistent with all the other evidence.\n\nFaulk follows that up with some baseless speculation:\n\n&gt; In my opinion, the Congo probably had a lower population density relative to it’s neighbors in 1900 than it does today, due to the jungle being easier to control with technology. I.e. – in addition to industrial farming methods that flatter African countries get, the Congo would also get jungle removal.\n&gt; And another reason to think this is that the Congo’s share of the population of Africa has increased from 1950 to 2016. And so the Congo’s population relative to the rest of Africa was probably lower in 1885 to 1900 than it is today.\n \nThere is no reason to make any of these assumptions and no evidence is presented to support them. Faulk then summarizes his various haphazard guesses to come up with what he considers a reasonable range for the population.\n\n&gt; If someone was given an assignment to estimate the population of the Congo Free State in 1900, and didn’t know about the “10 million” killed by Leopold and thus what the population had to have been for that to be possible, they wouldn’t come anywhere near 20 million. They would come to a mid-range estimate of 7 million, with the highest plausible being around 10.7 million, with an absolute maximum of 15.2 million, a low estimate of around 4 million, and an absolute minimum of 3.1 million.\n\n\nWhile there’s reason to be skeptical of some of the higher estimates, like Henry Morton Stanley’s initial estimate of 26 million for the starting population, there’s no basis for denying that there was a significant demographic impact. Even the minimal estimates of the death toll are in the millions.  And while it’s hard to quantify exactly with the material that’s available, the depopulation of the region is well documented and palpable. As University of Sheffield historian Aldwin Roes points out in “[Towards a history of mass violence in the Etat Independent du Congo]( http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/74340/2/roesAW2.pdf):”\n\n&gt; More relevant than a sterile polemic about aggregated numbers would be the compilation of a more precise geography of the impact and experience of EIC rule. Even at a lower level of aggregation no precise “body count” can be expected, as most deaths have never been recorded. However, aside from indirect evidence provided by skewed age pyramids in later population surveys, there is an abundance of qualitative evidence of demographic crises at the local level. African testimonies and memories of specific massacres as well as various accounts by European eyewitnesses bear witness to the extent of turmoil, famine, warfare and population decline in most parts of the EIC.\n\nIn Part II, we’ll look at Faulk’s attempts to minimize or deflect blame for the various hardships imposed by Leopold’s Congo regime.\n\n",

Frustrated with Red regarding the whole idea as stupid, she arranges for their pastor, Dave, to come over and hang out.  It goes about as well as expected, until the two men discover their mutual love of the Green Bay Packers.  And, as it would later turn out, other sports as well.\n\nThis takes us to season 4, episode 11, \"Third Wheel\".  In the opening sequence, the license plate shows a 1978 license plate sticker.  Since the year on the sticker only advances by one at a time, we can conclude that there was no multi-year renewal that took place; the car was not registered in 1974 for a five-year period up through 1979.  This would mean that this episode was either set in 1977 with the vehicle registration renewed into 1978, or in 1978 as it had not yet been re-registered into 1979.\n\nAs the episode begins, we see Red and Pastor Dave excitedly entering the Forman's kitchen, having just returned from a thrilling Milwaukee Bucks NBA game that went down to the closing seconds.\n\nThe Bucks had a unique history, having entered the NBA as an expansion team in 1968-69.  They struggled that first year, as most expansion teams do, finishing with a 27-55 record.  This put them dead last in the Eastern Division, meaning that they could win a coin flip against the Western Division basement-dwelling Phoenix Suns for the 1st pick in the 1969 NBA Draft.  The Bucks won the flip and selected future airline pilot Roger Murdock, by which I mean UCLA All-American Lew Alcindor.\n\nThe next year saw a stunning reversal, with the second-year Bucks climbing to a 56-26 record and making the playoffs.  And then in the offseason, a stunning trade was made that brought Oscar Robertson into the fold as well.  The Bucks surged to a 66-16 record, the second-best regular season in NBA history to that point, and then in the playoffs dismantled San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Baltimore en route to a league title in just their third season of existence.\n\nThe following two seasons (1971-72 and 1972-73) saw the Bucks fall short in the playoffs, and are best remembered more for Alcindor's conversion to Islam and subsequent re-naming to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  In 1973-74, they beat Los Angeles in a five-game first-round playoff series, then swept Chicago in four straight to advance to the NBA Finals.  Opposing them was the Boston Celtics.  The two teams went back and forth through the entire series: Boston won Game 1, Milwaukee Game 2.  Boston took a 2-1 lead by winning Game 3, Milwaukee knotted the series by winning Game 4.  Boston then won Game 5 in Milwaukee to take a 3-2 series lead.\n\n[Game 6, however, would prove to be one of the greatest games in NBA history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9NUC_mflTI).  A Boston win at home would give them the title, but Milwaukee wasn't done.  They had a six-point lead late, but Boston roared back to tie it and force overtime.  Milwaukee had a two-point lead in the dying seconds of overtime, but Boston's John Havlicek put back a rebound to tie it at 90-90 and force a second overtime.  In the second overtime, the teams furiously traded punches back and forth.  Havlicek hit a jumper with :07 left to give Boston a 101-100 lead.  The Bucks, confused on the inbound play, saw the ball end up in Abdul-Jabbar's hands at the Boston baseline.  With nowhere to go as time wound down, he lofted an awkward sky hook, which dropped in to give Milwaukee a 102-101 lead.  A long Boston shot was off the mark, and the Bucks had won Game 6 with the series tied going back home.\n\nAs it turned out, Game 7 in Milwaukee was not a good one for the home team.  Boston carried play from start to finish, winning the game and the championship.  It was also the end of the line for Oscar Robertson, who retired after 14 seasons in the NBA.  And after one more season, which saw him miss 17 games with injuries, Abdul-Jabbar was traded to Los Angeles.\n\nThe next two seasons were a transition, with the Bucks dropping to a 38-44 record in 1975-76 (but still good enough for a division title in the mediocre Midwest Division), and then 30-52 in the disastrous 1976-77 season.  They went 1-3 against the Abdul-Jabbar's Lakers, with the three losses by a combined 50 points.\n\n1977-78, when the episode of \"That 70s Show\" in question was apparently set, looked to be different.  Although the Bucks weren't exactly running away with the division, they were hovering around the .500 mark and were competitive most nights.  And that's what prompted the excitement when Red and Pastor Dave came into the kitchen after having seen a game:\n\n&gt;**RED**: Boy, Kitty, you missed a great game.  The Bucks made a last-second shot and sent those Lakers home with their tails between their California fruitcake asses! Go home, fruitcakes! I've never seen old Pastor Dave so excited. He swore at the referee.\n&gt;\n&gt;**PASTOR DAVE**: 'Son of a stitch', I said, 'Son of a stitch'.\n&gt;\n&gt;**RED**: Oh, well, I'm sure that fooled God.  Hey, Dave, the Celtics are in town tomorrow.  You up for it?\n&gt;\n&gt;**PASTOR DAVE**: I'm in!\n&gt;\n&gt;**KITTY**:  Oh, Pastor Dave, tomorrow's Sunday.  You have church on Sunday.\n\n\n[In the 1977-78 season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIL/1978_games.html), Milwaukee played the Lakers four times and went 1-3 against them.  The lone win was in fact at home, on October 18, 1977.  But this was the opening night of the regular season, and rather than being a last-second thriller, the Bucks pulled away late for a 117-112 win.  No buzzer beater.  In addition, Kitty's reference to tomorrow as Sunday would place the game that Red and Pastor Dave attended on a Saturday.  But October 18, 1977 was a Tuesday.  And although a home game against the Celtics would in fact be played on a Sunday, it wasn't until November 13, 1977.\n\n\"But wait!\", you may think.  \"Just because a license plate was registered through 1978 doesn't mean that it's entirely during the 1977-78 season!  After all, it may well be the 1976-77 season, assuming that the car was re-registered before April 1977.\"\n\n[In the 1976-77 season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIL/1977_games.html) - assuming an early-year car renewal before April of that year - Milwaukee played the Lakers four times and went 1-3 against them.  The lone win was in fact at home, a 110-106 victory on March 14, 1977.  And the Celtics would in fact be coming into town, but not until March 17.  However, March 14 was a Monday and the 17th a Thursday, meaning that these couldn't be the games in question.\n\n\"A-ha!\" you may think.  [There's no guarantee that it wasn't actually the 1978-79 season!](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIL/1979_games.html)  These teenagers played fast and loose with laws on underage drinking and also with the devil's lettuce, so a little thing like a vehicle registration may have been something they didn't care about as well.\"\n\nAnd this takes us to February 16, 1979.  The Lakers had lost two games in a row as they went into Milwaukee.  The Bucks had an eight-point lead with 7:26 to go, but the Lakers went on a 12-3 run to take an 89-88 lead with barely four minutes to play.  The teams then went back and forth, with the lead changing hands nine time.  Adrian Dantley hit a rebound off an Abdul-Jabbar miss with 0:11 left to give the Lakers a 98-97 lead.  On the ensuing possession, Milwaukee's Marques Johnson hit a jumper from the free throw line with :04 left to give the Bucks a 99-98 lead that they would keep.\n\nExciting stuff, to say the least.  It's not truly a buzzer-beater, but it's definitely a last-second shot as Red described.\n\nBut there's the second part as well...which is that this game had to be played on a Saturday to line up with the script.  And February 16, 1979 was a Friday night.  In addition, the next time that Boston came to town wouldn't be until March 28 of that year, which was a Wednesday.\n\nAnd there's a further problem.  In the same season, Episode 15 (\"Kelso's Career\"), the following exchange takes place:\n\n&gt;**KELSO**: I've been selling my love nectar.\n&gt;\n&gt;**JACKIE**: What? Michael, you can't do that.  You're hot!  Women are gonna want to take your little Kelsos home.\n&gt;\n&gt;**HYDE**: My God, she's right. Think about it- a world full of Kelsos.  Libraries will fall into disrepair.  There'll be feathered hair as far as the eye can see.  We'll have to put padding on every sharp corner!\n&gt;\n&gt;**KELSO**: Hey, those sharp corners can be hazardous, man.  I mean, come on.  It's 1978! Things should be round by now!\n\nNow, Kelso is dumb - like, *really* dumb - but the fact that no one corrected him on a simple topic like what year it was would lead us to conclude that this was in fact set in 1978.\n\nIn order for Red and Pastor Dave to have seen the game on February 16, 1979, Eric's car would have to had a lapsed registration *and* it would have to be seen somehow in 1978.  For this to happen, Red would have to plant his foot so far up Eric's ass that it would cause a bend in time and space, possibly defying everything that we know about both topics, just to see a universe in which the Bucks played both the Lakers and Celtics on consecutive nights at home.\n\nAs the son of a Midwestern father, I have little doubt that this would have been *attempted*, but I have serious doubts that it would actually happen.",

        "author": "Inkshooter",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7rgx8s/roman_fascists_ancient_whiteness_and_scare_quotes/",
        "text": "I sometimes go to a local bookstore's reading group where people can share things they've written, often personal essays and poetry. Sometimes I share my stuff, but mostly I just enjoy listening. Last week, after everyone was finished reading their work out loud, I decided to browse the store's collection, and found a zine on the periodicals and pamphlets rack that caught my eye. It was called *Colonization and Decolonization*, by an author named \"Zig-Zag\", and I was immediately drawn to it because of the interesting illustrations on the front as well as the fact that you don't often see zines that have history as the main draw, as opposed to reprints of public-domain short stories, punk and metal news, or instructions on how to make Molotov cocktails. The zine turned out to be pretty abysmal in terms of accuracy, though.\n\n**[Here](https://imgur.com/a/639Jc)** is a link to the pages that discuss primarily history as opposed to contemporary politics. I omitted one page due to an extremely graphic image.\n\n**Before I write anything else, I want to make abundantly clear that Zig-Zag's primary points in producing the zine, that colonialism has destroyed and marginalized indigineous communities across the globe, that most indigineous peoples continue to suffer immensely under the rule of settler nations, and that white supremacy is ubiquitous and insidious in the Western world are entirely accurate. I think it's likely that Zig-Zag is an indigineous person themself, and the zine was likely created from a place of righteous anger and very real pain. I don't want my criticism of the bad history within to take away from that, I merely hope that people who may read this post that want to create their own activist material in the future do better research so that their arguments may be made stronger.**\n\nI'm not going to dissect the entire zine, because, again, while the main point the author is trying to make is accurate, There are LOTS of things Zig-Zag gets wrong, either through oversimplification, deliberate obfuscation, or patently bizarre theories. The author has an obvious disdain for traditional historiography, as the common names for lots of historical concepts, such as the American Revolution, are in scare quotes. I chose three particularly egregious errors that I want to address, as well as one thing that kind of put me off but could just be a misinterpetation on my part.\n\n**\"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" \"FASCISM.\":**\n\nIn their account of the \"history of colonialism\", Zig-Zag claims that colonialism (as in, what Western Europe did to most of the rest of the world from the 1400s on) was invented by the Egyptians, which was then copied by the Greeks and Romans. I suppose it's an argument of semantics, but while the Greeks certainly did their fair share of colonizing I don't think it's particularly helpful to categorize any and all conquest and rule of neighboring territories as colonialism. But that's not my biggest issue with this passage. Nor is the claim that European peoples were all hunters and gatherers before Rome came along, or that worshiped a vague entity called \"Mother Earth\". The doozy is this quote:\n\n&gt;\"Today, very little remains of the European tribal cultures, which were destroyed and assimilated into the Roman imperial system (which explains why European civilization is essentially fascist in nature). \n\nWOW. Who knew that the Roman Republic was actually already an Empire during the Gallic Wars? Who knew that they were able to wipe out the manifold \"tribal peoples\" across all of Europe, including the Proto-Balto-Slavs, the Sami, as well as \"tribal peoples\" that didn't enter Europe until Rome had kicked the bucket, like the Magyars? Who knew that  Benito Mussolini was, in fact, a reincarnation of Julius Caesar that drew on Caesar's well-established 19th century nationalist ideals to entrench Italian Fascism? It all makes sense though, because how else could all of Europe have been Fascist for the past 1500 years? The merchant republics of the Mediterranean all rallied around their Doges as dictators to pursue national renewal, and the various bishoprics and church-run territories were well-known for their deeply entrenched nationalism!\n\nExcept none of that is true. I suppose I should come to expect a VERY loose definition of \"fascist\" in zines such as this, but it's a ludicrous anachronism that isn't even consistent. Where did the Romans learn fascism from? Why did their European territories become fascist but not their immense holdings in Africa and the Middle East? Zig-Zag provides no further explanation to this throwaway line.\n\n**The Phantom Inquisition and Roman Wife-Slaves:**\n\nThe section on Patriarchy is pretty short and also the worst part of the whole thing, so I'm going to quote most of it:\n\n&gt;Patriarchy means 'male rule'. Most ancient civilizations began as patriarchal systems, in which adult males had all political, economic, and social power.\n\nWell, yeah, pretty much...\n\n&gt;Women had no more rights than slaves. In ancient Rome, the adult male of a household could kill his wife or sell her and their children into slavery.\n\nOh. Oh dear. While there were certainly women in Roman society who were slaves, there were also a large number of citizen women, who could not be bought and sold freely. Women were also allowed to divorce and own property in both the Republic and the Empire. I suppose a man *could* kill his wife and children, but they do that sometimes in modern times too.\n\n&gt;During the European Middle-Ages, millions of women were killed during the Holy Inquisition. They were accused of being witches and pagans.\n\nI've scoured my Church History books (it's one of my favorite topics) but I can't find a single reference to a \"Holy Inquisition\" in the middle ages that targeted witches and had millions of victims. This can't be referring to the Spanish Inquisition, which wasn't medieval, had nothing to do with witchcraft, and was a lot smaller scale than people think. Nor could it refer to the witch trials of the early modern period, which did indeed result in many women being murdered but in numbers in the tens of thousands, nowhere close to the \"millions\" claimed here. This will have to remain a mystery.\n\n**Afrikaans Don't Real:**\n\nThis isn't really bad history in itself, but more a creative decision potentially informed by bad history. Throughout the entire piece, Zig-Zag consistently spells \"Africa\" and \"African\" with a K. I pondered why this was, and after a quick Google I discovered [this](http://www.informafrica.com/information/why-do-some-people-spell-africa-with-a-k-afrika-vs-africa/) page, which outlined the belief that \"Afrika\" is a more \"Afrikan\" spelling of the continent than \"Africa\", which is interpreted to be a European, colonial invention. This claim is dubious to say the least since NEITHER spelling in the Roman alphabet is native to Africa, unless you count North Africa under Roman rule... where it was spelled with a 'C'. To give an example of a spelling in an African writing system, the Ge'ez script spells it with a 'ካ', which is not a 'K'. Furthermore, the spelling \"Afrika\" is used in both German and Dutch, languages spoken by nations that were heavily involved in the colonization of southern Africa, including the Belgian Congo. It's by no means incorrect to spell it this way, but the reasoning behind doing so is highly flawed, unless I'm completely wrong about this and Zig-Zag had some other purpose for the alternate spelling.\n\nAnd there you have it, *Colonization and Decolonization*, the zine. As I said before, I only addressed a few of the topics covered in the zine. It covers a wide range of historical periods, and I'm eager to hear further points from people who have more education and sources in areas I did not cover.",

        "text": "Hello fellow historians! Today I will be dissecting a small tidbit of badhistory from the non-profit Conservative digital media organization known as Prager U. Some of you may know them as Prager University, which is what they prefer to be called, but as they do not have any degree programs, let alone the two doctorate degree programs necessary to be called a university, they aren’t allowed to actually use that name so neither will I. Here is a link for those of you who wish to watch the video for context on the subject of this post.\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiprVX4os2Y\n\nIn this video that will be discussed Prager U argues that the Southern Strategy is not only a myth but three myths which they will attempt to disprove Do they have any evidence cited to backup their claim? Of course not! But that’s never stopped badhistory before! I will however only be looking at Prager U’s first supposed myth simply due to my library’s lack of sources on Southern politics in the late 20th century. I’m positive that the rest of the video is a wealth of badhistory but without proper sources I don’t feel comfortable delving into it for fear that I may create some bad history myself. And just a quick note before delving into this topic, I feel that it is important to define what the Southern Strategy is for those of you who are not American or maybe are just unfamiliar with the subject. The Southern Strategy was a Republican Party electoral strategy in the 1960’s to increase political support among white voters in the American South by appealing to racism against African Americans. So now that the term is defined let’s look at what PragerU thinks is a myth.\n\nSo the myth about the Southern strategy that Prager seeks to disprove is that “In order to be competitive in the South, Republicans started to pander to white racists in the 1960’s”. The evidence Prager U uses to refute this claim and prove that Republicans were competitive in the South as early as the 1920’s is that Herbert Hoover won several Southern states in the 1928 election and that Dwight Eisenhower won three Southern states in 1952 and six Southern states in 1956. This is a pretty weak counter argument as both cases are attributable to factors outside of party affiliation and do not prove that the Republican party had strong support in the South prior to the 1960’s.\n\nFirst let’s look at their claims about the 1928 election. Al Smith was the first Roman Catholic candidate for president and faced a massive uphill battle in his fight against the strong anti-catholic sentiment in the United states which had existed for the entirety of the nation’s history, and while he performed better amongst catholic voters than any candidate had ever done before, but he was unable to assuage protestant fears about his religious affiliation. The nomination of Smith as the candidate for president of the Democratic Party was actually so controversial amongst Democrats at the time that the Klu Klux Klan held massive rallies to protest a catholic representing their party. Smith’s religious views coupled with a distrust of urbanites (Smith was born and raised in New York City) in the 1920’s placed Smith at a serious disadvantage in the 1928 election. Hoover on the other hand was following up on President Calvin Coolidge, who had overseen the economic boom of the roaring 20’s, which allowed the Republican party to be affiliated with economic prosperity. Smith only managed to win 8 states in that election. 2 Northern states which he won through his appeal to catholic immigrants, and 6 Southern states which he won primarily due to his party affiliation. In the rest of the South a distrust of his religion and a desire to continue economic prosperity of the Coolidge administration gave Hoover the edge he needed to win the rest of the Southern states. It is notable however that Hoover, despite all of his advantages, only managed to win 47% of the Southern vote. This suggests that despite Smith’s faults many Southerners distrusted the Republicans even more than they distrusted a Catholic urbanite. All in all the 1928 election is a very poor example to use of Republican competitiveness in the South prior to the 1960’s due to the unusual circumstances of the election and the Republican party’s poor performance despite the odds seemingly being hugely in their favor.\n\nPrager’s other example is fairly more simple to explain as to why it was an outlier. The simple answer is that Eisenhower was a national hero who had greatly aided the United States in their war effort to bring down Nazi Germany. He was a shoe-in  for the presidency, especially since president Truman had associated the Democratic party with his unpopular war in Korea. It should be noted however that the only states that Eisenhower’s Democratic opponent, Adlai Stevenson, managed to win were all Southern states. As for the 1956 election Eisenhower was just finishing a successful first term as president in which he had ended American involvement in the Korean war. It was fairly obvious that he would win reelection and perform even better than he had in his first election, especially since his opponent was the same man he had trounced in the 1952 election. It is notable however that despite in the 1952 election the only states that Eisenhower lost were Southern states and in 1956 he also lost primarily in Southern states though with the notable addition of Missouri. Thus Eisenhower’s elections are also a poor example for Prager to use as an example of Republican presence in the South. In both cases that they cite Republican candidates who were unusually popular and in both cases Republican won every state outside of the South (with the exception in Missouri in 1956) and were still unable to win a majority of Southern states. With this in mind I’d say that Prager U’s examples ironically prove that the South was solidly Democrat as two historically popular Republican candidates were unable to win a majority of Southern states despite their electoral sweep of the rest of the nation. \n\nThank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it!\n\nBibliography\n-Silva, Ruth Caridad.

        "author": "historian87",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7q5fqq/the_myth_of_the_irish_slaves/",
        "text": "One of the more pernicious myths, typically spread around the United States, for political reasons, in the form of memes, is the myth of Irish slaves in the Americas. Let's get it out of the way immediately; the Irish were never slaves. Instead, they were indentured servants. Were they mistreated and forced into labor upon arrival to the USA? Yes. But indentured servitude had a beginning and an end. Chattel African slavery did not. Whatever those political reasons are for spreading this myth is irrelevant to this post. All that matters is the fact that spreading such a myth is harmful to the endeavor of the historian, which is the truth no matter the cost. Unfortunately for those who believe this myth it isn't true. A letter signed by 82 top Irish scholars gives a sense of the credibility of this myth \n\nhttps://medium.com/@Limerick1914/open-letter-to-irish-central-irish-examiner-and-scientific-american-about-their-irish-slaves-3f6cf23b8d7f\n\nA detailed study of the myth, and convincing proof against this myth, is given by a renowned librarian and scholar of Irish history. The study is very thorough and is in five parts \n\nhttps://medium.com/@Limerick1914/the-imagery-of-the-irish-slaves-myth-dissected-143e70aa6e74#.dugyl3ycm\n\nA detailed look into the Irish indentured servitude of the Caribbean can be found here \n\nhttp://www.irlandeses.org/0711rodgers2.htm\n\n\n\nSlavery, in Colonial America, had very detailed legal origins. Those laws specifically vilified blacks and absolved all whites from condemnation and participation in slavery. Indentured servitude also involved a contractual agreement between boss and worker. With African slavery, there was no contract involved and African children who were yet unborn would eventually become slaves as well. \n\nLastly, centering your understanding of Irish history around a pernicious and stubborn myth degrades the realities of actual Irish history. The history of the Irish, like all history, should be studied objectively, and as free as possible from social or political bias. This is so that the integrity of both the scholar and the sources can shine through. \n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7pggv2/best_of_rbadhistory_awards_winners/",
        "text": "Once a year we look back and celebrate the top contributions to the sub. The voting is now closed, the shiny reddit gold prizes have arrived, and we're ready to announce the winners. If you want to have a look at the posts that didn't quite make it, [here's the nomination post](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7j1qtt/the_best_of_rbadhistory_2017_awards_nomination/) where they are all listed.\n\n###Worst History\nThe worst of the worst goes here. There was only one double nomination in this category this year, so the prize will go to both posts.\n\n[**\"Islam was responsible for WW1\" and other amusing thoughts. Featuring: r/The_Donald**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6zsknd/islam_was_responsible_for_ww1_and_other_amusing/) by /u/SilverCaster4444 who not only took on the main topic, but also bravely took a dive into an absolute cesspit of a thread to fish out more pearls of bad history. Read it and weep.\n\n[**\"Hitler was a Voluntaryist\"**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7fixz0/hitler_was_a_voluntaryist/) by /u/Emass100. The sheer stupidity of the original claim is just the start, apparently Hitler's Germany was a transition state towards anarchy, and the holocaust was justified because of a boycott by a country called Judea (must have been those dastardly time travelling Jews again).\n\n###Most Unusual\nNo one expects this type of bad history! We had some great nominations here with posts about \"The Mutiny in Skylab\", \"Jack the Ripper writing Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Anime Conquistadors getting history wrong\", but the winner is:\n\n[**This Scottish King was also the King of Ireland, and was also black, and was also King of the Iberians and Hebrews, who are the same people as the Berbers and the Igbo, who all cut hair for a living**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5ohg2k/this_scottish_king_was_also_the_king_of_ireland/) by /u/ultach . I don't think I can add anything to explain that the title doesn't already cover. The post is debunking one big waterfall of borderline insane afro-centrist history, ranging all over Europe. \n\n###Most Informative Rebuttal\nThese are the posts from this year where you learned something new, have an extensive R5 and source list, or a combination of the two. We had two nominations here, and the voting was quite close, so both will win a prize here as well.\n\n[**\"Anti-semitism is historically a result of Jewish behaviour\"**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7295lg/antisemitism_is_historically_a_result_of_jewish/) where /u/silvercaster4444 tackles the age-old racist bugbear of the Jews somehow being responsible for all their expulsions and prosecutions throughout the ages. They created an extensive list of all claims and one by one counter them. The research is extensive and useful for whenever some racist redditor inevitably brings this up again.\n\n[**Bad cannon history at the New York Metropolitan museum**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7dlhsp/bad_cannon_history_at_the_new_york_metropolitan/) by /u/terminus-trantor who discovered a misdated Asian cannon in the New York Metropolitan Museum. This is an excellent piece of research with an exhaustive source list that's well worth a read, even if you're not into gunpowder weaponry. Out of curiosity, I'd love to know if /u/Genealogy_Ina_Bottle has an update on whether the mistake was fixed in the museum.\n\n###Best Media Review\nBad history in TV shows and movies is pervasive, be it leather armour everywhere, merging multiple historical characters or events into one to save on time, bad sourcing by using the wrong type of \"expert\", etc. In this category /u/cleopatra_philopater cleaned up the nominations with their reviews of bad Egyptian drama and a music video. The winner is:\n\n[**Katy Perry's \"Dark Horse\" is not particularly accurate to the shock of all present**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6hx93q/katy_perrys_dark_horse_is_not_particularly/) where it becomes painfully obvious that Katy Perry cares little about historical accuracy and takes many liberties with Egyptian history in her attempt to rewrite history to give herself an Egyptian heritage. Shame!  \n\nBTW their review of \"Hallmark's Cleopatra\" is well worth a read too. \n\n###Best Series\nSometimes the bad history is so extensive, that it requires multiple posts to review it. In this category we reward the tenaciousness of those who were willing to keep at it and post over and over about the same topic. In the past we've had such brilliance as the Guns Germs and Steel series and the Deadliest Warrior series of reviews, and I'm proud to announce that this year the winner is:\n\n[**The Nation’s Largest Collection Of Lighthouse Bloopers**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6wyyjl/the_nations_largest_collection_of_lighthouse/) by /u/garrisonhalibut who wrote a six part post thread on all the errors encountered in the articles on boatnerd.com about the Apostle Island lighthouses, a group of historical lighthouses located on Lake Superior. It's not just thorough, but also very entertaining to read.\n\n###Most Pedantic\nIf there's anything we love here it's ultra-Pedantry. Be it the weather in Buffy, Yakko's World Song from Animaniacs, or whether grannies ever started wars. This year's winner is:\n\n[**\"The Deadliest Warrior\"? More like \"The Most Inaccurate Warrior\": a look at woodworking, the national pastime, and historical anachronisms.**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6dqi0l/the_deadliest_warrior_more_like_the_most/) by /u/The740 which initially sounds like it might be one of ByzantineBasileus's reviews of the show, but it turns into a very detailed review of baseball bat history, outlining the history of the choice of wood, manufacture, and weight. And all that to counter the maple baseball bat used by the mafia enforcer in the show. It is beautiful.\n\nA close runner up was /u/Tiako with their post on \"[**Mesolithic Far Cry**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7i72m0/far_cry_primal_is_a_far_cry_from_an_accurate/)\" who will also receive a prize.\n\nAnd a honourable mention for a last minute entry from /u/thecorvus303 for a [Lego-copy toy tank review](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7n67es/model_kit_review_cobi_panzer_iv/) which I think would have done great if it would have had more time to get some votes. \n\n###Best Flair\nThis is often a tricky category when it comes to nominations because there is no good way to search for a specific flair or, even better, provide a user list with all our flairs, but we still think it's worth a category since the BadHistory flairs are a constant source of amusement and brilliance. The winner this year is:\n\n **/u/thecorvus303 with \"The existence of Jews violated Hitler's NAP\"**. Well deserved!\n\n###Funniest Post\nLots of our posts use humour to bring the message across, but every once in a while, a post comes along that is just hilarious from start to finish. This is a new category this year, so no previous winners to glorify, which means straight to the winner:\n\n[**Guns, Germs, and Steel, a reassessment**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/62urcv/guns_germs_and_steel_a_reassessment/) by /u/whatismoo. GGS is one of those books that makes most BadHistory users groan instinctively whenever it's mentioned, but whatismoo made us look back and reassess our harsh criticism of the book in their brilliant and funny post. \n\n###Funniest Comment\nAnother tricky category that's wholly dependent on what people remember, but to honour the peanut gallery and its ability to throw golden peanuts into a post, we still think it should be here. Part of the fun of every post is to read the snark, puns, and jokes people come up with in the comments, so this year's winner is:\n\n\n[**So these aren't conspiracy nuts or holocaust deniers, they're pen fetisists?**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5jzl95/anne_franks_diary_is_a_fraud_a_look_at_anne_frank/dbkbyzx/) by /u/ontopic when faced with a post debunking the claim that Anne Frank couldn't have written her diary with a fine ballpoint pen.\n \nThe runner up here was /u/thecorvus303 with \"**Unfortunately, no. The Crimean War was a hoax perpetrated by (((Alfred Tennyson))) to trick people into reading his poem about British cavalry saber charging Russian tanks**.\" who lost out by just one vote.\n\n###Best Snapshillbot Comment\nSnappy regularly knocks them out of the park, making a relevant comment quote to a post, and this year was no different. Its winning comment was:\n\n[**Lincoln was literally Hitler. Who never killed anyone, either.**](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/6u2xuo/bbut_sherman_was_a_bad_guy_too_he_burned_atlanta/dlpgtu4/) in a post dealing with claims that general Sherman was a bad person to for burning Atlanta and Savannah. Lovely bot, never change.\n\n###The End\nCongrats to the winners, who should now all have their gold, and thanks everyone who participated in this year's Best Of event. It's been fun writing this up.

The Germans weren't good at it at first. **When Stalin was killing 20,000 Polish officers in the Katyn Forest, he invited Hitler's SS to watch, to see how it was done.** He had devised a system to ensure there was no rioting and running, with carefully timed truckloads of soldiers and pre-dug graves. The SS officers stood around taking notes.\n\n&gt;Bloodlands, by Timothy Snyder, gives a pretty grueling account of it.\n\n[Link to Comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/7oq5o0/naked_and_humiliated_woman_cries_out_in_rage_and/dsbrel2/)\n\nThe redditor won't back down from his comment:\n\n&gt;It's in Bloodlands, which is one of the best researched books about the Holocaust I know of.\n\nAnd he/she continues to make up facts about the event:\n\n&gt;I guess that's how they knew where to look. They \"found\" the mass graves when Hitler attacked Russia and they no longer had to pretend to be Allies.\n\nIt is incredible that the redditor thought the SS participated and studied the massacre. Nazi Germany was expertimenting with mass murder before the Katyn Massacre happened. The user even cited Bloodlands by Timotyh Snyder as a source. I searched for SS participation in Katyn Massacre and no results showed up. Reviews of the book Bloodlands also turned up nothing about this SS invovlement. \n\nI believe the redditor mixed up details in the book and presented it as facts. \n\nFor those who don't know about the Katyn Massacre:\n\n&gt;The Katyn massacre was a series of mass executions of Polish nationals carried out by the NKVD (\"People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs\", a Soviet secret police organisation) in April and May 1940. Though the killings took place at several places, the massacre is named after the Katyn Forest, where some of the mass graves were first discovered.\n\n[Katyn Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre)\n\nWhat didn't make sense about the redditor's comment is that the Germans later found the grave by local sources and used it as anti-Soviet propaganda. \n\n&gt;In early 1943, a German officer serving as the intelligence liaison..., received reports about mass graves of Polish military officers. These reports stated the graves were in the forest of Goat Hill near Katyn. He passed the reports to his superiors. Joseph Goebbels saw this discovery as an excellent tool to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies, and the Soviet Union, and reinforcement for the Nazi propaganda line about the horrors of Bolshevism, and American and British subservience to it.\n\n[Katyn Massacre Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre#Discovery)\n\nThe Soviet government immediately denied the German charges. It wasn't until 1989 that Soviet Union revealed and admitted the crime. \n\nIt was estimated that 22,000 Polish nationals were murdered. ",

I'm not sure about the Soviets i could realistically see them making stuff that could go any way in terms of cost.\n\nAlso i'm talking about strategic cost like manhours and material cost, not money.

        "text": "**Sigh**. I can already predict some of the heated replies to this post. \n\nIn fact, any post that tries to list historical achievements of a particular ethnic group, culture, nationality or religion will find the exact same \"critiques\", so I'll just address some of them right off the bat.\n\n&gt; You said X-invention was invented by Y group of people. Wikipedia says it was invented by Z groups of people centuries before, Y just specialized it and made it more popular! FAKE NEWS!!\n\n\nInventions, contrary to popular belief, are not so cut and dry as:\n\n&gt;  \"Hey, look. I'm the person that invented this neat thing. Me, my country, everyone who keeps the same traditions as me, everyone that has the same religion, and everyone who shares the same skin tone as mine are to credit.\" \n\nHonestly, 90% of the time the \"inventor\" themselves aren't even the ones to completely credit, as all they did was \"up\" a pre-existing creation. Many don’t even do that; history just tends to happen to favor them. Textbooks round the world credit Thomas Edison for the creation of lightbulbs and telephones, but all he was a PR man who had a habit of pocketing the patents of others for his own gain. Thomas wasn't even the first in line to start working with electricity, there were dozens of men who spent their entire lives perfecting commercial lighting and communication before and after Edison, yet if you ask millions of people globally who invented lightbulbs/telephones, the answer will overwhelmingly be:\n\n\"Like... that Thomas dude. Thomas something... Thomas Eddie??\n\nHell as I type this, there's a teacher somewhere telling her students to remember that Thomas Edison was the guy who invented the lightbulb for the test next Friday.\n\nOr what about inventions that were improved later in time? Who gets the credit for creating telescopes? Galileo does, but all he did was improve an original design by [Hans Lippershey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lippershey). \n\nWhat about inventions that were \"invented\" time and time again by separate peoples throughout history? The concept of the \"Pythagoras theorem\" is credited to, well, Pythagoras. Historians disagree, considering as there's textual evidence of the theorem [millennia before Pythagoras was even born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plimpton_322), from [various](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhoubi_Suanjing) different [cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulba_Sutras) from around the world.\n\nThere are hundreds, if not, thousands of examples of this all throughout history. \n\nIt's as Isaac Newton said:\n\n&gt; [\"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\"]\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants)\n\nOr as Mark Twain more aptly put it:\n\n&gt; [\"It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a photograph, or a telephone or any other important thing—and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others. He added his little mite — that is all he did. These object lessons should teach us that ninety-nine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple; and the lesson ought to make us modest. But nothing can do that\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy)\n\nSo when a list-maker comes along every now and then makes a list about what accomplishments a certain group of people have made, it's not always as inaccurate or far from the truth as a few hecklers would have you think.\n\nYou know what **is** inaccurate *AND* far from the truth?\n\nTo claim that black people have invented absolutely nothing in the entire history of their race outside of peanut butter. \n\nWhich is exactly what r/The_Donald does [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6e03kt/cultural_appropriation/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4h70ho/cultural_appropriation/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5yt4rg/cultural_marxism_for_thee_but_not_for_me/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/sjwhate/comments/5a25r1/cultural_marxism_for_thee_but_not_for_me/)\n\n[Image in question](https://i.redditmedia.com/EtRgSZFgDNtu88B1LGZ-oQJXm9vYA9N6z9AW03KGQuE.jpg?w=748&amp;s=f45e62b4c9c2800533c775d3054a1908)\n\nA bit of background.\n\nThe webcomic series, or RedPanels, describes itself as \"Red Pill in Webcomic Form\" and \"the alternative webcomic\". It was created way back in 2015 to provide \"counter points\" to the \"liberal media narrative agenda\". The webcomic touches upon a multitude of popular subjects, ranging from immigration to nationalism, usually through a right-wing lens. Despite it mostly covering the seemingly mainstream pro-Trump sentiments, there are more obscure ones that display the author's more very... [* ahem *](http://redpanels.com/comics/vampire-jew-comic.png), [interesting](http://redpanels.com/328/)...\n[beliefs.](http://redpanels.com/6/). \n\nDespite the fact that the dude's plainly an [anti-Semitic pile of doo doo](http://redpanels.com/169/), having his swan song drawing end off with a literal [Nazi salute](http://redpanels.com/), It's a relatively popular web comic among social conservatives and neo-reactionaries, who don't know anything about his more... eccentric beliefs. (I hope).\n\nAnyways, there's not really too much to debunk in either graphics. They imply one of two things\n\n1)\tBlack People haven’t invented anything (outside peanut butter and mud huts of course)\n\n2)\tWhite people/culture have invented everything outside of the two above mentioned items\n\n  All one has to do to prove it wrong is simply list anything invented by a **b l a c c** person or literally anything **NOT** invented by a white guy outside of peanut butter. That's too easy, so I’ll do both and I'll analyze some comments at the end to top it off.  ~~since every low-effort post mentioning T_D gets upvoted hard on this sub and therefore receives a volley of hate for being “low-effort”~~\n\nNow, here's some inventions that could accompany the lonely missus in the final panel of the comic with that jar of peanut butter\n\n&gt; 1. Anything George Washington Carver made\n\nIt's a tad ironic that of the hundreds of inventions George Washington Carver made during his lifetime, he is most famous for one he had nothing to do with. Yes, I’m talking about Peanut Butter.\n\nThe consumption of things that can be described as peanut butter actually dates back to Incas and Aztecs, while the the first example of peanut better being patented goes to Marcellus Gilmore Edson of Canada (funnily enough, if you google his name, the first image that comes up is of GWC).\n\nHowever, if RedPanels/The_Donald is willing to credit peanut butter to George Washington Carver (aka something he didn’t actually make), they should at least give him the credit for *hundreds of items* he invented throughout his lifetime out of peanuts. The list includes: soap, face creams, axle grease, insecticides, glue, medicines. I mean just look at the [dude’s sweet mustache]( http://www.boiled-peanut-world.com/images/xGWCarver13.jpg.pagespeed.ic.NznFqbTvKT.jpg), it counts as its own major contribution. \n\nThe man also helped popularize crop rotation and enhancing the market value of countless plants which he used for his inventions. Those plants would later become their own major crops, such as sweet potatoes, soybeans and peanuts (duh). When he died in 1943 President Franklin D. Roosevelt dedicated funds to erect a monument at Diamond, Missouri, in his honor.\n\nNot bad for a man who was born and kidnapped as a slave, not bad at all.\n\n&gt;\tThe Answering Machine\n\nBefore 1935, life was a bit difficult for telephone users, to say the least. \n\nYou had to hope that the person you wished to call was near an answering machine in order to get your call across. If not, then your missed called was permanently lost. This all changed when Benjamin F. Thornton meshed a phonograph, some record discs, an electric motor, and few electric switches to create the world’s first answering machine.\n\nNot only would the phonograph record the calls people had made, Thornton attached a clock to the machine that would switch the discs so it would also stamp the time the call had taken place.\n\n&gt;\tTorpedoes\n\nIn the 1864 the Paraguayan War (between Paraguay and a Triple Alliance of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay) started and would last until 1870.\n\n Naval battles were significant, and weapon that could damage enemy vessels over a distance were sought after. André Rebouças, designed an immersible device which could be projected underwater, causing an explosion with any ship it hit. The device became known as the torpedo.\n\nWhile it was revolutionary, it wasn’t very effective and was overshadowed by Robert Whitehead’s version a handful of years later.\n\n\n&gt;\tThe Predecessor to Dry Cleaning\n\nThomas L. Jennings (1791-1859) was the first African American person to receive a patent in the U.S., paving the way for future inventors of color to gain exclusive rights to their inventions. Born in 1791, Jennings lived and worked in New York City as a tailor and dry cleaner. He invented an early method of dry cleaning called \"dry scouring\" and patented it in 1821\n\nJennings became active in working for his race and civil rights for the black community. In 1831, he was selected as assistant secretary to the First Annual Convention of the People of Color in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which met in June 1831.\n\n He helped arrange legal defense for his daughter, Elizabeth Jennings, in 1854 when she challenged a private streetcar company's segregation of seating and was arrested. She was defended by the young Chester Arthur, and won her case the next year.\n\nWith two other prominent black leaders, Jennings organized the Legal Rights Association in 1855 in New York, which raised challenges to discrimination and organized legal defense for court cases.\n\n&gt;\tModern Home Heating\n\nIn 1919 a patent was filled for a “new and improved home heating furnace”. It was the first time someone had thought of using natural gas to heat homes, replacing the previously used fireplaces and stoves. It was filled out by a woman - an African-American one (gasp) – named Alice H. Parker.\n\n Unfortunately, other than that, there’s not much else know about her, as she essentially disappeared from the pages of history after filling out her patent. \n\n&gt;\tCarbon Filaments, Improved Railroad Designs, and an early version of the Air Conditioner\n\nSince the previous example has to do with home *heating*, it’d be just perfect for this example to include home *cooling*.  And that’s exactly what Lewis Latimer invented, among others. Born from runaway slave parents, he grew up to collaborate with the greatest minds of his time, including Hiram Maxim, Alexander Graham Bell, and Thomas Edison.\n\n He worked with Bell to develop his telephone, created the carbon filament (a vital component of the lightbulb), He obtained a patent for the safety elevator and Locking Racks. He was later hired by Thomas Edison to review and test out patents, he also authored the one of the most most comprehensive books on electric lighting, “Incandescent Electric Lighting: A Practical Description of the Edison System.” \n\nLatimer next developed a method of making rooms more hygienic and climate controlled. He named his system an “Apparatus for Cooling and Disinfecting,” The device did wonders in hospitals, preventing airborne dirt and dust particles from circulating inside of patient rooms and public areas. \n\nLewis also had a taste for the arts as he: painting portraits, wrote poetry with friends, and composed music.\n\n&gt; Touch-tone Phones, Portable fax machines, and the Fiber optic cable\n\nWhile she didn’t single-handedly create these, Dr. Shirley Jackson helped provided immeasurable strides in telecommunication technology. Jackson conducted successful experiments in theoretical physics and used her knowledge of physics to foster advances in telecommunications research while working at Bell Laboratories. Dr. Jackson conducted breakthrough basic scientific research that enabled others to invent the portable fax, touch tone telephone, solar cells, and fiber optic cables, among others. \n\nMrs. Jackson was also the first black woman to earn a doctorate from MIT, the first black female president of a major technological institute, and became the first black woman appointed chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nOh, and “The Father of the Fiber Optic Cable” is considered to be Narinder Singh Kapany, a Sikh from Punjab.\n\n&gt;The Imaging X-Ray Spectrometer\n\nGeorge Alcorn was given the 1984 “NASA Inventor of the Year Award” for creation of the of the X-Ray Spectrometer, a device which analyses the X-ray emission spectrum a material produces results about the elemental composition of the specimen. \n\nNow, I have no idea what that actually is, it sure does sound impressive, and if it’s good enough for NASA, it’s more than good enough for me.\n\n&gt;America’s First Clock\n\nApparently, being credited with creating America’s first sticking clock apparently wasn’t enough for young Benjamin Banneker. He had to do it with a pocket watch he: \n\n&gt;borrowed, took apart, carved each miniscule piece into a larger scale, and rebuilt it.\n\nThis arguably isn’t even what Mr. Banneker is most remembered for. He also was one of the first African-Americans to publish an almanac -one he created through his self-taught knowledge of astronomy - not to mention he was part of the party which surveyed the original borders of what is now the District of Colombia. \n\nOh, and he was a prominent abolitionist too.\n\n&gt;\tThe Laserphaco Probe\n\nPatricia Batch is a person I can only describe as “a woman of *many* “firsts””. \n\nIn 1973, Patricia Bath became the first African American to complete a \nresidency in ophthalmology (specialist in medical and surgical eye disease). \n\nIn 1975, Patricia Bath became the first female faculty member in the UCLA Jules Stein Eye Institute's Department of Ophthalmology. \n\nIn 1983, Patricia Bath became the first U.S. woman to serve as chair of an ophthalmology residency training program.\n\nAnd finally in 1988, Patricia Bath became the first African-American female doctor to receive a patent for a medical invention.\n\nThe patent she received was for a new cataract treatment, one which harnessed laser technology and far more accurate than what used to be used to remove cataracts – manual grinding. \n\nThis (for obvious reasons) was incredibly difficult and excruciatingly pain. \n\nPatricia dubbed her invention the “Laserphaco Probe”. She received patients for it in Canada, Europe, Japan, and, the US. With her device, she managed to remove cataracts from patients that had grown massive and had caused their blindness for over three decades.\n\n&gt;Railroad Coupler and Rotary Engines\n\nLike many others on this list, there’s not much information one can say on Andrew Jackson Beard. We know he was born as a slave in Alabama in 1849, and worked as a slave for the first 15 years of his life before Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. \nAt 16, roughly a single year after he was freed, Andrew married and started a farm with his wife just near the small county he was born. While on the farm, he was able to develop and champion his first invention (a plow). Three years later, he patented a second plow. These two inventions earned him almost $10,000 (worth nearly 200,000 USD in 2017), with which he began to invest in real estate.\n\nFollowing his stint in the real-estate market, Andrew Beard began to work with and study train engines. In 1890 and 1892, while living in Woodlawn, Beard patented two improvements to the knuckle coupler. Beard's patents were U.S. Patent 594,059, granted on 23 November 1897 and U.S. Patent 624,901 granted 16 May 1899. The former was sold for the equivalent of almost $1.5 million (adjusted for inflation).\n\nAfter this, we don’t know much else about him. Little is known about the period of from Beard's last patent application in 1897 up to his death.\n\nHe was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\n&gt;Self-Propelled Street Sweepers\n\nIf you’ve ever had to sweep your home for chores, you’d know how difficult it can be. Now imagine instead of you booming your house, it was every street in your country, armed with nothing except a long horizontal head broom, shovel and dustpan. This is what street sweepers did for centuries till Charles Brooks came along.\n\nHistorically, prior to Brooks' truck, streets were commonly cleaned by walking workers, picking up by hand or broom, or by horse-drawn machines. Brooks' truck had brushes attached to the front fender that pushed trash to the curb.\n\nAs far as Brooks was concerned, the regular way of cleaning the streets was too daunting and not very cost-effective. So, he decided to create a sort of broom – or sweeper – and attach this device to a truck. Hence the concept was born of the 'street sweeper truck.'\n\nBrooks patent was approved on March 17th, 1896; his application for the patent was filed on April 20, 1895. The street sweeper could best be described as a truck frame mounted on the axles which are supported by front and rear wheels. There are drive-wheels for the sweeping, elevator mechanisms, and an endless chain that travels around a sprocket-wheel and travels up to an additional sprocket-wheel. There is a squared shaft, which is mounted at opposite ends in bearings in the upper parts of a pair of vertical standards consisting of the back or rear parts of the truck-frame and then sustained by braces, which extend from the standards to the truck-frame.\n\nThe patent drawings go on to explain the complete composition of the invention. For those who are lost on the technical terms, above, here it is in layman terms: The truck had brushes attached to the front fender which would revolve. These revolving brushes could interchange to a flat scraper that could be used in the winter months for snow and ice.\n\n&gt;Improved Air-Purification Filters\n\nRufus Stokes was born and grew up in southern Alabama. On November 5, 1940, just before receiving his high school diploma, Rufus Stokes enlisted in the US Army at Fort Benning, Georgia in the Quartermaster Corps to fight in World War 2. (This would make him the **second** child solider on this list. To be honest, I was expecting this list to have a couple former slave, but not former child soldiers).\n\nIn the Army, he attended a technical school where he received auto mechanic training. He was deployed in western Europe and served predominantly in the Rhineland campaign. Upon his discharge, he was decorated with an American Defense Service Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, and Good Conduct Medal.\n\nSoon after, he moved to Kansas City, Missouri, where Stokes was employed as a part-time auto mechanic. In 1947, they moved once again, to Waukegan, Illinois where he found temporary employment as a pipe and sheet metal worker\n\nBetween late 1947 and 1949, Stokes was employed as an orderly at the Chicago Veterans Administration Hospital, specifically in the Tuberculosis Sanitarium. It was during this time that he first saw the negative health effects of the city's pollution. In 1949, he left the hospital and found work at Brule Inc., an incinerator manufacturing company in Chicago. He quickly learned the process of combustion and was thought to have contributed heavily in the designs of new incinerators, but was never credited for his work. For that reason, he left to pursue his own interests.\n\nHe later created a smaller domestic version and a larger mobile version of the air purification device to show its versatility. This device further reduced the ash emissions of the furnace and power plant smokestack emissions. Moreover, it was not limited by design and configuration, meaning that its efficiency remained excellent regardless of industrial or residential applications. This was not true of typical air pollution control technologies, such as electrostatic precipitators, bag houses, and wet scrubbers. The larger the device that utilized these approaches, the more cumbersome and inefficient it became. The core of Stokes' technology was a unique utilization of what he described as \"the three Ts\": Temperature, Time and Turbulence. In his patent applications (U.S., U.K., Germany and Japan), he provided only data sufficient to obtain patent approval. Other critical processes involving variations of physics were not revealed, but nevertheless manifest in demonstrations to municipal, state and federal officials and engineering firms such as A.T. Kearney. The ability of the APC-100 to convert particulate matter and toxic gases resulting from the burning of rubber tires and other combustibles to steam was a constant source of intrigue to those who witnessed its operation.\n\nIn 1982, Rufus Stokes was granted a doctor of science degree from Heed University in Hollywood, Florida on account of his scientific achievements.\n\n&gt;The Wire/Electrical Resistor, IBM computers, and the pacemaker\n\nOtis Boykin was born on August 29, 1920, in Dallas, Texas. \n\nHis mother died while was just a year old and his father worked as a carpenter. He wasn’t able to complete his university degree because he couldn’t afford to pay the tuition. Most people (namely me) would decide to give up entirely after all these setbacks, but this didn’t prevent Otis. \n\nAfter dropping out of university, Boykin became a lab assistant, gaining just enough money to create his own company, Boykin-Fruth Inc. Using his own corporation as a starting point, Boykin patented a number of his own creations, including some that he had been working on before but hadn’t found the time to fully perfect. After that, Otis found immense success with his inventions.\n\nIn total, Otis Boykin would eventually come to hold 28 patents. Some of those include: The electrical wire resistor, IBM computers, chemical air filters, a burglar-proof cash register, and improvements on the pacemaker. Ironically, while he greatly improved on the device which would extend the lives of millions around the world suffering from heart disease, Otis himself died of heart failure at the age of 62, his inventions saving and continuing to save the lives of countless individuals.\n\n&gt;Home Security\n\nMost people would consider slow police action a bad thing, but for Marie Van Brittan Brown, it was a source of inspiration (and a really bad thing too, but I digress). \n \nAlthough she was a full-time nurse, she recognised the security threats to her home and devised a system that would alert her of strangers at her door and contact relevant authorities as quickly as possible. \n\nHer original invention consisted of peepholes, a camera, monitors, and a two-way microphone. Anything the camera picked up would appear on a monitor. An additional feature of Brown's invention was that a person also could unlock a door with a remote control. The finishing touch was an alarm button that, when pressed, would immediately contact the police. \n\nHer patent laid the groundwork for the modern closed-circuit television system that is widely used for surveillance, home security systems, push-button alarm triggers, crime prevention, and traffic monitoring.\n\n&gt;The Disposable Syringe\n\nPhil Brooks (also known as CM Punk) is an American comic book writer and retired professional wrestler.  He is currently signed with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He is best known for his time in WWE, where he was a two-time WWE Champion, including a 434-day reign from November 20, 2011, to January 27, 2013, that is recognized by WWE as one the longest wrestling reigns in its history.\n\nOops, not that Phil Brooks. The Phil Brooks I’m talking about is the African-American inventor, and receiver of US patent #3,802,434 for a “Disposable Syringe” on April 9, 1974.\nIt consisted of:\n\n\"A single unit douching device includes a flexible bag having an opening therein. A rigid nozzle is affixed to the bag at a location remote from the opening. A sealing means is also affixed to the bag adjacent the opening to seal the opening after douching materials are inserted through the opening into the bag.\"\n\n&gt;The 1-GigaHertz Microchip, IBM’s color PC monitor, and Industry Standard Architecture (ISA)\n\nEver heard of Mark Dean? Well you should have, He’s one of the most prominent black inventors in the field of computers. He was one of the original inventors of the IBM personal computer and the color PC monitor. \n\nHe is also responsible for creating the technology that allows devices, such as keyboards, mice, and printers, to be plugged into a computer and communicate with each other, as such he holds 3 of IBM’s original 9 patents and to date holds 20 others.\n\nOne of his most recent computer inventions occurred while leading the team that produced the 1-Gigahertz chip, a CPU with 10^9 hertz (or 1000000000 Hz) of processing power. It contains over one million transistors and has nearly limitless potential. \n\n&gt;CM-2: One of the World’s Fastest Supercomputers\n\nAn Igbo immigrant from Nigeria, Dr. Philip Emeagwali was born on 23 August 1954. At the age of 13, he served in the Biafran army in the Nigerian Civil War. (You read that right, he was a literal **child solider**)\n\nAfter the war, he left for America after the war in 1977, getting a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State University. He later moved to Washington DC, receiving in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and marine engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland\n\nIn 1989 he won the Gordon Bell Prize with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M, faster than any computer before. \n\nFor this (and other achievements) Philip Emeagwali has been celebrated as “The Bill Gates of Africa”\n\n&gt;Modern Game Consoles/Videogame Cartridges\n\nEver played video games? Of course you have! If you haven’t, well, err… you really should. And when you do, you’ve got Jerry Lawson to thank for making major contributions to the art. A completely self-taught engineer, as a teenager he made money by repairing his neighbors' television and radio sets. \n\nIn 1970, he joined Fairchild Semiconductor in San Francisco as an applications engineering consultant within their sales division. While there, he created the early arcade game Demolition Derby out of his garage.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Lawson was made Chief Hardware Engineer and director of engineering and marketing for Fairchild's video game division. There, he led the development of the Fairchild Channel F console, released in 1976 and specifically designed to use swappable game cartridges. At the time, most game systems had the game programming stored on ROM storage soldered onto the game hardware, which could not be removed. Lawson and his team figured out how to move the ROM to a cartridge that could be inserted and removed from a console unit repeatedly, and without electrically shocking the user. This would allow users to buy into a library of games, and provided a new revenue stream for the console manufacturers through sales of these games. Lawson's invention of the interchangeable cartridge was so novel and influential that every cartridge he produced had to be approved by the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nIn late March 2011, Lawson was honored as an industry pioneer by the International Game Developers Association. His accomplishments as an engineer and inventor were appreciated by the IGDA. One month later he passed away from complications of diabetes. \nR. I. P.\n\n\n&gt;The SuperSoaker\n\nA NASA scientist (who worked on the Galileo Jupiter probe and Mars Observer project) and retired US Air Force Commander and Chief, Lonnie G. Johnson holds almost [100 patents to his name](http://www.patentgenius.com/inventor/JohnsonLonnieG.html) Including various lithium fuel cells, rechargeable batteries, and reversible engines. But today we’ll be looking at his most important contribution to humankind – the SuperSoaker\n\nJohnson conceived of a novelty water gun powered by air pressure in 1982 when he conducted an experiment at home on a heat pump that used water instead of Freon. This experimentation, which resulted in Johnson shooting a stream of water across his bathroom into the tub, led directly to the development of the Power Drencher, the precursor to the SuperSoaker.\n\nLonnie G. Johnson now has his own company, Johnson Research and Development, and continues to do work for NASA.\n\n&gt;The Gamma-Electric cell\n\nHenry Sampson, (along with his partner George H. Miley), invented the gamma-electric cell (a device with the main goal of generating auxiliary power from the shielding of a nuclear reactor).\n\nI have no idea what that it or what it does, but it sounds useful and science-y, so I’m putting it here.\n\nOh, and he was a member of the United States Navy between the years 1962 and 1964\n\n&gt;The Illusion Transmitter\n\nValerie Thomas was interested in science as a child, after observing her father tinkering with the television and seeing the mechanical parts inside the TV. At the age of eight, she read The Boys First Book on Electronics, which sparked her interest in a career in science.  At the all-girls school she attended, she was not encouraged to pursue science and math courses, though she did manage to take a physics course. Thomas would go on to attend Morgan State University, where she was one of two women majoring in physics. Thomas excelled in her math and science courses at Morgan State University and went on to eventually become a NASA scientist after graduation.\n\nIn 1980 she received a patent for her invention of Illusion Transmitter, a device which NASA continues to use today, decades after her retiring from the organization.\n\n&gt;Electret transducer technology/The foil electret microphone\n\nHave you ever listened to music online? Recorded yourself with a microphone or used earbuds for privacy? Well, there’s a 90% chance you’ve utilized one of James West’s numerous inventions.\n\nBorn in Prince Edward County, Virginia, on February 10, 1931, James was pressured by his family and peers not to continue his passion for science academically ( were concerned about future job prospects for an African-American scientist. Afraid of the racism and Jim Crow laws of the South. They preferred for him to become a doctor\n\nHere’s a quote of his that essentially summarizes his situation:\n\n&gt; “In those days in the South, the only professional jobs that seemed to be open to a black man were a teacher, a preacher, a doctor or a lawyer. My father introduced me to three black men who had earned doctorates in chemistry and physics. The best jobs they could find were at the post office.”\n—James West.\n\nUndeterred, West headed to Temple University in 1953 to study physics and worked during the summers as an intern for the Acoustics Research Department at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. He received a bachelor's degree in physics in 1957, and was hired for a full-time position as an acoustical scientist by Bell.\n\nIn 1960 (while at Bell) West developed an inexpensive, highly sensitive, compact microphone. In 1962, they finished development on the product, which relied on their invention of electret transducers. By 1968, the electret microphone was in mass production. West's invention became the industry standard, and today, 90 percent of all contemporary microphones—including the ones found in telephones, tape recorders, camcorders, baby monitors and hearing aids—use his technology.\n\nAs of 2017, James West is still kickin’ and holds over 250 patents.\n\n\n&gt;The Fire-Escape Ladder\n\nJoseph Richard Winters was an African-American abolitionist and poet. His father was a bricklayer and his mother was a Shawnee Indian. \nOn May 7, 1878, he received U.S. Patent number 203,517 for a wagon-mounted fire escape ladder. During April 8, 1879, he received U.S. Patent number 214,224 for an \"improvement\" on the ladder.  In May 16, 1882, he received U.S. Patent number 258,186 for a fire escape ladder that could be affixed to buildings.\n\nWinters had noticed that firemen had to carry inconvenient ladders to burning buildings, mount those on wagons, then climb to windows, rescue people, and spray water on fires. All simultaneously, or lose precious time that allowed the fires to spread. Not to mention that the ladders themselves couldn't be too long or the engine wouldn't be able to turn corners into narrow streets or alleys.\n\nWinters thought it would be smarter to have the ladder mounted on the fire engine and be articulated so it could be raised up from the wagon itself. He made this folding design for the city of Chambersburg and received a patent for it. His second patent was given to him for improvements on his original design. His third and final patent was received in 1882 for a fire escape that could be attached to buildings. He reportedly received much praise but little money for his innovations.\n\nWinters’ invention was almost immediately utilized by the Chambersburg, Pennsylvania fire department who mounted the ladder on a horse-drawn wagon, and modern firetrucks still use a variation of Joseph Winters design. \n\n&gt; Telegraphs, Telephones, Electric Railways, and Incubators\n\nNicknamed “the Black Edison”, Granville T. Woods was quite the ingenious fellow. All in all, he patented around 60 inventions throughout his life, including a telephone transmitter, the trolley wheel and the multiplex telegraph.\n\nGranville was born to poor but free parents. Consequently, he received very little schooling that likely ended at the Elementary level.\n\nIn his early teens Woods took up a variety of jobs, including work in a railroad machine shop, as an engineer on a British ship in a steel mill, and as a railroad worker. From 1876 to 1878, Woods lived in New York City, taking courses in engineering and electricity—a subject that he would come to realize, early on, held the key to both his and the world’s future.\nWoods's most important invention is arguably the multiplex telegraph, also known as the \"induction telegraph,\" or block system, in 1887. The device allowed men to communicate by voice over telegraph wires, ultimately helping to speed up important communications and therefore preventing crucial errors such as train accidents. Granville also created the telegraphony, a combination of the telegraph and telephone\n\nGranville’s successes however caught the eye of a more… malevolent inventor. The inventor in question filed lawsuit to Granville’s devices, claiming they were stolen from him. The inventors name? Thomas Edison\n\nThomas Edison stating that he had first created a similar telegraph and that he was entitled to the patent for the device. Woods was twice successful in defending himself, proving that there were no other devices upon which he could have depended or relied upon to make his device. After Thomas Edison's second defeat, he decided to offer Granville Woods a position with the Edison Company, Granville declined. (Gee I wonder why?) Subsequently, Woods was formerly known known as \"Black Edison.\"\n\n&gt; The Blood Bank\n \nIt’s quite literally impossible to calculate how many people would have lost their lives without the contributions of African-American Inventor Dr. Charles Drew. No I mean literally, impossible. [One person in America needs blood every two seconds](https://www.redcrossblood.org/learn-about-blood/blood-facts-and-statistics). Imagine how many people need blood worldwide every two – no, every *one* second. You’d need one of the CM-2 computers mentioned above to be able to calculate that. All of those lives are indebted to Dr. Drew’s innovation and struggles as the researcher and surgeon who revolutionized the understanding of blood plasma – leading to the invention of blood banks.\n\nBorn in 1904 in Washington, D.C., Charles Drew excelled from early on in both intellectual and athletic pursuits. And I mean *excellent*. He was offered both athletic and medical scholarships from multiple colleges and universities. He decided to study at two of them, Amherst collage for his athletics, and McGill University to pursue his doctorate.  Drew graduated second out of a class of over a hundred. After becoming a doctor, Dr. Drew went to Columbia University to do his Ph.D. on blood storage. He completed a thesis titled “Banked Blood” that invented a method of separating and storing plasma, allowing it to be dehydrated for later use.\n\nIt was the first time Columbia awarded a doctorate to an African-American. He also became the first African-American surgeon selected to serve as an examiner on the American Board of Surgery, where he would later become the chief surgeon.\n\nJust before the U.S. entered World War II and just after earning his doctorate, Drew was recruited by John Scudder (a British Physician) to help set up and administer an early prototype program for blood storage and preservation. He was to collect, test, and transport large quantities of blood plasma for distribution in the United Kingdom. Drew went to New York City as the medical director of the United States' Blood for Britain project. The Blood for Britain project was a project to aid British soldiers and civilians by giving U.S. blood to the United Kingdom.\n\nDrew created a central location for the blood collection process where donors could go to give blood. He made sure all blood plasma was tested before it was shipped out. He ensured that only skilled personnel handled blood plasma to avoid the possibility of contamination. The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma. As a result, the Blood Transfusion Betterment Association applauded Drew for his work. \n\nDrew’s work would eventually culminate into the American Red Cross Blood Bank. Ironically, while Charles was responsible for the creation of the organization, he would eventually resign as the ARCBB practiced racial segregation of blood. They refused to accept African-American blood and would only transfer plasma to white soldiers and citizens. Outraged at both the practices racism and lack of scientific foundation Charles left the position.\n\nWhen Dr. Charles Drew died from a car crash in 1950, the ARCBB ended its discriminatory policy. According to legend, Drew was actually brought to the hospital he had helped found but was refused service on account of his race.  He died April 1st, perhaps the saddest April Fool’s joke played to one of the most monumental figure here.  \n\nNow obviously this is a very short list and I can’t possibly hope to list the achievements and innovations of every African person on the planet, both the one we know and the countless more we’ve lost to the pages of time… but the point still clearly stands and if RedPanels or T_D actually gave a shit about history they wouldn’t have made/posted the image. \n\nFor further reading:\n\n1)https://www.nationalgeographic.org/news/african-american-inventors-18th-century/\n2)https://www.nationalgeographic.org/news/african-american-inventors-19th-century/\n3)https://www.nationalgeographic.org/news/african-american-inventors-20th-and-21st-century/\n4)https://thinkgrowth.org/14-black-inventors-you-probably-didnt-know-about-3c0702cc63d2\n\n\nNote: This is an updated version of earlier one that got removed.

        "text": "I have already done several posts about this topic in sister subs, but I have recently again stumbled upon a few posts over on /r/history claiming again the age old fact which everyone knows: that Ottomans blocked Asian goods and spices from reaching Europe and that prompted Iberians to go around Africa and across the Atlantic. \n\nAnd i just *had* to do a big post here as well.\n\n So here are some of the sort of comments that pop up all the time\n\n[First](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7n2vi6/why_did_the_europeans_lead_the_age_of_discovery/dryloe3/) one is simple:  \n&gt;Well we all know that america was discovered during the search for new trade routes (cause the ottomans blocked the old ones). That is also what inspired most colonization - wealth. Gold from america and spices from asia\n\nWhile his second sentence - that wealth inspired most colonization - is sort of true (it was infinitely more complex than that) the first sentence, especially the remark in the brackets is totally wrong.\n\nAnother [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/7n2vi6/why_did_the_europeans_lead_the_age_of_discovery/drypqbq/)  is even more incorrect:\n&gt;Mediterranean countries benefitted hugely from trade with Asia. With the Ottoman conquest of the Byzantine Empire, they lost their link to the east, and had to find new routes. The Portuguese began sailing around Africa, and one Genoese man thought he could get there by sailing directly west.\n\nThis post in particular shows the full extent of the wrongness. It proposes that by loss of Byzantine empire, Europe “lost the link” to East, and “had to” find new routes. And only after this preconditions happened have Europeans began exploring.\n\nThe appeal of this myth is of course the simplicity and obvious casualty. One thing clearly led to another, and for our poor human minds looking for order in chaos, this might seem reasonable. \n\nUnfortunately absolutely everything about it is completely and utterly wrong on so many levels that it warrants a lengthy post. Not to be very philosophical myself I will quote Lybyer from all the way [back in 1915](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50860?msg=welcome_stranger#Footnote_32_33) tackling this myth:\n\n&gt;The entire hypothesis seems to be a legend of recent date, developed out of the catastrophic theory which made the fall of Constantinople an event of primary importance in the history of mankind. The great discoveries had their origin in a separate chain of causes, into which the influence of the Moslems of Spain, North Africa, and the Mameluke empire entered, but not that of the Ottoman Turks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reasons why this is so are numerous. Let’s break it down to few key ones. First from Iberian side we have few observations:\n\n**1. Atlantic voyages and going down African coast started well before 1453**\n\nThe Portuguese Atlantic voyages started after 1415 with conquest of Ceuta (Spanish-French expeditions to Canaries even before that). Madeira was colonized in the 1420s, Azores in 1430s. Caravels were used since 1430s and furthest point visited so far - Cape Bojador - was passed in 1434 and regular voyages beyond were being conducted afterwards. By 1450s the exploration down African coast- in actuality more slave raids - on which we have much information, brought Portuguese all the way past Senegal and Gambia rivers, to the vicinity of modern Sierra Leone. Here is a [map](https://i.imgur.com/cYFkRQ2.png) trying to show the extent of lands already discovered by around 1450  \n\n\n\n**2. Motives recorded by Portuguese themselves for start of exploration never mention  any kind of “lack” of spices**\n  \nWe just have to open the *[The Chronicle of the Discovery and Conquest of Guinea,  Vol. I](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35738)*, on Chapter VII by Gomes Eannes de Azurara who lists the reasons (he considered) why the Prince Henry decided to explore Africa: curiosity and zeal of service to god and king, new economic opportunity (but no mention of spices, just generally opening a new market in Guinea), gauging the extent of power of Moors, and finding allies against Moors (specifically Prester John) and finally spreading Christianity.   \nObviously not mentioning the unavailability of spices does not mean it didn’t occur, but still, contrasting with the importance it was supposed to have i think it would feature more prominently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*On the Mediterranean side of things we have other, more relevant, issues*\n\n\n**3. Constantinople was actually not the most important point for the spice trade at all, as Venice (and Genoa and French and Catalan) got the vast majority of their spices in Alexandria and Beirut** \n\n\nIt shouldn’t really be surprising when you think about it. Spice originated in India and SE Asia, and it went to Europe by ships on the sea route to Red Sea and Persian Gulf where land caravans would take them through Egypt and Syria to ports on Mediterranean.There it would be picked up by European traders and transferred by ships to rest of Europe. Constantinople would be a detour on that route, not the center point. See this Venetian routes to [Alexandria](https://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/images/map_alexandria.gif) and [Beirut](https://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/images/map_beirut.gif) as recorded by 15th century Venetian sailor Michael of Rhodes([source](https://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/michaelofrhodes/journey/index.html))  \n\nThe overland routes from China to the Black Sea, and from there Europe, for which Constantinople was important, were only a part of this Asia trade, and spices would definitely not go through there. To back up these claims, let’s show the table showing Venice pepper imports in years 1394-1405, basically much before ottoman conquest, from Wake: *\"The Volume of European Spice Imports at the Beginning and End of the XVth Century\"* (1986) [available in full here](http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:1986;3.621&amp;ev=1)   , page 632 \n\n\n\nArea | Pepper(lbs) | Spices(lbs)\n----|-----------|-----------\nAlexandria | 1,614,300 | 221,335\nBeirut | 414,250 | 449,987\nRomania (Constantinople)  | 67,920 | 43,687\n\nAs we can see, pepper and spices poured from Levant, not Constantinople in order of magintude larger amounts.\n\n**4. Fall of Constantinople had little effect on prices of pepper and spice (and from there we can conclude also the supply)**\n\nTo show this part, we will reffer to Frederic C. Lane and his paper [Pepper Prices Before Da Gama](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2115514?Search=yes&amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;searchText=lane&amp;searchText=spice&amp;searchText=prices&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3Ffc%3Doff%26hp%3D25%26wc%3Don%26amp%3D%26amp%3D%26amp%3D%26amp%3D%26amp%3D%26amp%3D%26so%3Drel%26Query%3Dlane%2Bspice%2Bprices%26acc%3Doff%26prq%3Deconomic%2Bimpact%2Bfall%2Bof%2Bconstantinople&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) where he lists the prices of pepper through the years in Venice. The expectation being that after 1453, if the trade routes were closed we would see the effect in prices. I’ll post the photo of the table he compiled [here](https://imgur.com/jbKJuuP). Analyzing this we can see that in the period of 1430- 1490 the price of pepper remained relatively the same. Compare that to events of 1499-1503 when the price of pepper really jumped which is related to both Second Venetian-Ottoman War and Portuguese incursion in Indian ocean that really stopped the flow of pepper. Analyzing previous years, we can really conclude there is no obvious shortage or stoppage of spices coming to Europe prior to 1499 related to Ottomans, or any other Muslim nation, at all. \n\nInteresting detail: Lane’s table shows another very curious incident - sudden spike in prices between 1409 and 1411 and remaining until 1430s. The reason is still unknown but one guess it was the result of the Zheng He expeditions which bought massive amounts of pepper, seriously altering the supply side of pepper for europe resulting in massive prices.\n\n**5. Egypt and Syria - the main spice routes-  weren’t even Ottoman controlled until 1517 - decades after the Columbus and Da Gama expeditions**\n\n\nOne of the most important things is that Ottomans were confined to the areas of [Balkan and Anatolia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1b/OttomanEmpire1481.png) , with Mamluk Sultanate controlling Egypt and Syria. The Ottoman conquest of Levant happened only in 1517 following the Ottoman Mamluk war, which is significantly after both discovery of America and Portuguese presence in Indian Ocean. \n\nAlso, but this I can’t prove, it is quite probable the Portuguese temporary stoppage of pepper flow to Egypt, and the unsuccessful expedition to Diu to expel the Portuguese, led to weakening of the Mamluk state and ultimately it being consumed by the Ottomans\n\n**6. Ottomans, Mamluks nor for that matter any other Muslims never ‘stopped the spice trade’ to Europe, nor would they want to (for a longer period)**\n\nThis is an important point and one which too many people just don’t think about. Why would the Ottomans stop the trade to Europe in the first place? Just because they were Christians? It would make no economic sense, and accomplish nothing. Even in times of conflict with some of the nations, like Venice, there were plenty of other traders filling the void: French, Ragusan, Catalan, Genoese, later English and Dutch also. I will only mention and hope I don’t have to go into details of the [French-Ottoman alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Ottoman_alliance) and [capitulations granted by Ottomans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitulations_of_the_Ottoman_Empire) as I am really not an expert in Ottoman diplomatic and trade relations. However their very existence is the ultimate proof that trade was never stopped.\n\nEdit Whoops. I forgot here to add some key data  \n\n\nTable 2. Venetian galley import average annuals for years **1496 - 1498** from Wake: \"The Volume of trade ....\", page 633 (13/16 in the link)\n\nArea | Pepper(lbs) | Spices(lbs)\n----|-----------|-----------\nAlexandria | 1,754,480 | 2,140,880\nBeirut | 603,150 | 563,231\n\n\n\nBasically, this data in the table above shows how much pepper and spice did the Venetians import by the end of 15th century. The total amount is even larger then in the beginning (table for 1394-1405) indicating not only the trade never stopped but that it even increased (but this might be just Venetians muscling out competiton). To be fair, just this data alone still allows the possibility of stopping the trade in mid 15th century and then recovering but a) that's unlikely as we have zero indications for this and b) if it even recovered than the point that Muslims stopped trade is still moot  \n\n/Edit\n\n\nEven in the 16th century, when the Ottomans really did control the Levant, and Portuguese the Indian Ocean, the trade through Egypt and Syria was ongoing. There are even some indications the spice route through Levant superseded the Portuguese route around Africa in the2nd half of 16th century. See this [table](https://imgur.com/SllqXXX) compiled by Reid showing pepper and spice imports to Europe. The values for 16th century indicate there was an ongoing trade through Ottoman areas to Europe. This theory (of Levant route being larger then Portuguese route in late 16th century) is very widely accepted, but some authors, like before mentioned Wake, made some IMHO very compelling counter arguments. However I do not think this is the appropriate time and place to go into this discussion. Suffice to say, whatever those details are, trade goods have always passed through Levant to Europe\n\n\n----\n**To come to some sort of conclusion.**   \n\nThe statement that Ottoman stoppage of trade caused age of discovery is totally unsupported and also unreasonable statement reducing all of the parties to ridiculous simplifications. \n\nIf we are to believe it we have to forget that Mamluk Sultante existed, and Ottomans were clearly some spiteful haters who would rather not earn money then simply trade with Europe.   \n\nThe Portuguese, and Spanish, aren’t that vilified to point of cartoonish, however their motivations are still reduced to simply responding to the complete absence of spice and trade. Instead of the more truthful version of them simply trying to open an alternate, more profitable, line of supply next to an already existing one. \n\nWhy is that so hard to grasp?",
