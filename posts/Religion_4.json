There will always be homosexuals and trans people in these faiths who cannot bring themselves to leave and staying and fighting as one of them or staying and fighting as an ally with them is a noble pursuit in itself. It‚Äôs also noble to leave a faith if you don‚Äôt believe there will ever be progress made on this issue in that faith. Neither approach is inherently right or wrong. It‚Äôs up to the individual.

        "text": "First, I‚Äôm aware this is a sensitive topic. I‚Äôm genuinely curious to hear people‚Äôs responses as I‚Äôm unable to make sense of this.\n\nWhy do Evangelical/conservative Christians oppose abortion? \n\nMy question is directed specifically to Christians who agree with all four statements below, which I believe should be most Evangelicals:\n\n1.\tSalvation for adults is dependent upon believing in Jesus‚Äô death and resurrection and requesting the forgiveness of sins through that death\n2.\tThose who aren‚Äôt ‚Äúsaved‚Äù will go to Hell and experience eternal torment\n3.\tGod would not send a baby/fetus to Hell for failing to believe in Jesus because they didn‚Äôt have the chance to believe\n4.\tThere are only two options, Heaven or Hell. Those who don‚Äôt go to Hell go to Heaven\n\nIf an individual rejects any one of those four premises, I can think of reasons to oppose abortion within the worldview. But if someone accepts these four premises, why would it be ‚Äúbad‚Äù to abort a fetus? It saves them all the suffering they would experience on Earth and guarantees they go to Heaven, which is supposed to make the best experiences on Earth pale in comparison. \n\nSo why is this bad? Why is it in fact ‚Äúgood‚Äù to require someone to live through life in a Fallen world where even the most fortunate people will experience suffering and the least fortunate will experience almost unending misery? Why is it better for someone to grow up and, statistically, be more likely to go to Hell than Heaven?\n\nI see anti-abortion artwork, poems, etc. that say things like ‚ÄúGod weeps over all the deaths from abortion,‚Äù and I can‚Äôt figure out why. Similarly, people often ask the question ‚Äúwhat if your parents had aborted you?‚Äù My only response is basically ‚Äúif your worldview is correct, that would‚Äôve been great.‚Äù And overall I have a pretty good life.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

You guys can add your own stuff in here to make it more appeal.

I never knew the word Armageddon derived from the name of a city. This has me curious about prophecies and narrations about who might be part of the end coming about. \n\nDo other religions have a concept of an awaited person who will either bring about the end of the world, or herald a new chapter of peace on earth?\n\nHow do other religions describe how the world will know said person is here? How will they be drawn to their presence?\n\nHow do other religions describe how the world will change under them? Become a world of peace and Justice or it‚Äôll be a sign of the endtimes?\n\nThanks in advance for your time!",

Al+Lah or The Lah became Allah, some propose, and others repeat this rather confidently as if they are 100% assured of this allusion. Even right here on Reddit. \n\nWell. Leaving aside the most gutter level of linguistic farce, this is incorrect and is based on one of the most stupendous mistakes one could make. \n\nYes. We see this in websites run by evangelical movements and of course ‚ÄúYoutube‚Äù. But has no basis. Some people, when asked for evidence to this claim easily point to even a wikipedia page. And they see the word ‚ÄúIah. And belief brought out by frequent citing on the internet is so much that we have become blind to what we see blatantly right in front of us. \n\nIts ‚ÄúIah‚Äù, not ‚ÄúLah‚Äù. It‚Äôs a capital ‚ÄúI‚Äù (I). Not a simple ‚ÄúL‚Äù (l). The thing is both look similar. \n\nSo you could imagine the level of sophistication in the proponents of this kind of argument. There is no more explanation needed. Some people have written large books about it, of course in the meantime making snide remarks. And they even bank on the so called \"islamic flag\" with a crescent moon. Mate, there was no \"Islamic flag\" of that sort in the 7th century. Since this came up, i thought to place it here. \n\nPeace. \n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iah)\n\n[https://youtu.be/rV13Zzl2PLU](https://youtu.be/rV13Zzl2PLU)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/11gsuug/why_were_the_early_jewish_people_so_dogmattic_and/",
        "text": "This question has just been bothering me lately and Iv been trying to find the right place to ask this.\n\nFirst of all this is not a anti Jewish post, this is specifically talking about the early Jewish people and not modern Judaism. honestly Modern Judaism has changed itself into something entirely different then what it originally was and thats something to be proud of. hell most critiques of Judaism have came from modern Jews. \n\n**Now getting into the topic**\n\nAlot of the early Jewish peoples dogma is found in their own text. they constantly Demonize other religions and make themselves out to be the better religion then all of them. We often times see accusations like \"child sacrficer\" or \"Adulter\" Thrown at other religions and then make themselves out to be these heros of \"god\" trying to make the world right. Despite much evidence would lead us to believe that the early Jews themselves practiced things like Child sacrifice. However..\n\n**They are not technically wrong, but they are also very ignorant.**\n\nWere tribes of Pagan and Cannanites commiting child Sacrificing? Yes likely so, Many gods were associated with that including Yhvh. Cannanites are more tricky with this because we only have jewish text and some other text that talks about them. However every outside source doesnt back up the idea Cannanites committed child sacrifices, however the sistering religions of the cannanites did. Moabites and Israelites all practiced child sacrifices at some point, hell even early Jews did. The issue is the early Jews make the claim that EVERY cannanite, Pagan or anyone that wasnt them to sacrifice children. Its as if they never bothered to understand other religions.\n\nAdultery however is where some of this idealistic im right and the rest of the world is wrong starts to shine. Accusing Pagans of being Adulters and claiming the Cannanites were as well but not understanding that alot of pagans had a practice called \"sex offerings\" in which two CONCENTING adults have sex with each other and dedicate it to the god, its still practiced by Pagans today. From the Jewish perspective at the time it makes sense they came to that conclusion when they didnt even bother understanding the other religion. We also see they called the Egyptian goddess Isis the great whore, not even understanding what that goddess represented in Egyptian belief. \n\n**The issue with the Jewish Dogma and why it likely happened**\n\nThe major Issue with this Dogma that the jewish people spread is it did not set Christianity up (though it didnt intent on making another religion) well and can be a major reason why christianity is as hateful as it is in scripture and in practice. The amount of lies that the early Jews made up about other religions out to be bad and going out of the way to highly disencourage questioning their authority does not encourage people to try to see or accept any diversity that is found in the world. Most event in both the tora and Tenakh can not be backed up by history. Hell there isnt even good evidence of Moses or Abraham and almost all books in the tenakh have no accurasy to them. The problem is the Tora constantly makes you feel guilty if you question \"the lord\" and almost encourages you not to which is a big critique some jews have made for the early Judism.\n\nThe early Jews being like this is to a point merited. the early Jews were constantly oppressed by other religions and people, even early text would show us that the early Jews were not even monotheistic and had many gods in their belief. [https://www.seeker.com/gods-wife-edited-out-of-the-bible-almost-1766083399.html](https://www.seeker.com/gods-wife-edited-out-of-the-bible-almost-1766083399.html)  \n\nAlot of scholars state that the switch to Monotheism was due to a traumatizing event that happened likely some kind of harsh oppression. They needed to make themselves out to be different then other religions because other religions where the ones oppressing them. While they werent the first Monotheistic religion they were the only around the group of other religions that they were surrounded by. At least thats what I think\n\nWhat can you guys tell me about this dogmatic situation? and do we have any text from other religions or society's that talk about the jewish people?",

I remember when I was going for confirmation, my catechism teacher told us that if we were unsure.. not to go through with it. I told my mom and she rolled her eyes and said I was going to go through with it so I can get married in a church.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm in my early 30s.. married (not by church) and have a baby that I'm iffy about baptising. I feel it's a cultural milestone but I am weirded out by what it represents. I don't see my baby as a sinner. I tried out church again a few times with my husband and I felt even more disconnected. I wanted to get married by church prior to baptizing the baby, but I felt like I didn't belong there. \n\nYet, when I am in times of trouble I call on Jesus. When I went for my emergency c section I did the sign of the cross. Habit? I don't know. \n\nYears ago when dealing with depression, I started yoga. I then got into more meditation classes/Kundalini yoga etc and the way I felt during meditation.. I felt like that is how my connection with God should feel. \n\nI guess I am just wondering if anyone has gone through something similar? I feel like a phony and confused. I believe that the bible has taught me certain values however I do not feel connected to Jesus or know how that feels to other people. Maybe I am being too literal? I'm not sure.",

        "text": "I have noticed that sometimes on this forum, we talk a lot about what people want, need, or get out of their religions (like on the \"what is my religion\" threads), but not as much about what different religions ask people to give.\n\nMy belief is that many of the most important impacts of religion come from committing oneself to the discipline of a particular tradition and working to meet the demands and rigors of that path, even and especially when it's difficult. It's in that devotion and perseverance that conviction is tested, character is forged, wisdom is won, and, hopefully, we have the opportunity for a genuine encounter with what is sacred and true.\n\nSometimes it seems like some folks are seeking a religion that simply confirms what they already think and endorses the way they already live. Everyone is of course entitled to their own values and choices about religion. We all have things we deeply believe and things we simply cannot accept, and some religious communities are abusive and harmful and no one should have to put up with that. But to me, this approach risks missing the point. \n\nSo I'm curious, what does your religion ask of you? What have you taken on and what have you given up for your religion? How does your religion challenge and push you?",

        "text": "Let me start off by saying that both religion and God(s) are to be criticized like anything else wielding power. Criticism isn't a show of disrespect but rather a show of interest and if there's anything in this universe that is strong enough to withstand criticism it is God. Just because you are offended doesn't mean God is. I'm saying this to encourage honest, intellectual but respectful discussion.\n\nNow, I've been trying to understand whether Judaism, Islam and Christianity worship the same deity (which is also a question I'd like addressed). All three religions being of Abrahamic descent should mean that they indeed worship the same deity ie. Yahweh. To me it seems that Islam and Judaism worship the same monotheistic deity, despite the fact that Muslims don't have a personal name for Allah. Christianity, with the introduction of the Trinity and Christ as God, takes a sligtly controversial and different direction from the other two. So, do Islam, Christainity and Judaism all worship Yahweh?\n\n\nWhich then leads to the title question; why would a monotheistic God have a name, let alone one from a man-made language? What use is a name to God especially if there is no other God to differentiate him from? You might find that strange but isn't it for that exact reason that the planets and stars in our solar system have names but the sun and our moon don't? If there was a second sun or moon then we'd need names for them. If there's only one God isn't Islam more precise for not having a name for Allah? Also, who named Yahweh? Himself? Why?",

        "text": "This past month has been a painful rollercoaster for me, and I am now completely disheartened.\n(If you are able to, please try to understand my thoughts. I ask that you to judge me too harshly. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è.)\nFor a few days I believed in nothing, and that deeply depressed me. \nI tried delving deeper into an uncertain Christian belief, loving and appreciating God for all he‚Äôs done, but the subject of judgment and potential Hell for my loved ones scared me. I talked to a preacher friend who mentioned that many think that these concepts were added in afterwards by men due to cultural influences; Hell is a thing of this world that occurs when someone has taken up evil as their cause, and that the weeping and gnashing of teeth merely refers to humans doing evil unto each other. \nThat set my mind a bit more at ease. Now religion and fear did not have to come as a package deal. Even still, my beliefs were never firm, I was trying to become content with just saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù\nSince then, I‚Äôve been trying the belief of universal oneness with a great one true Being that wishes to see us, the universe, grow and be happy as a part of Being (think Eckhart Tolle‚Äôs teachings).   People of this thought incorporate a lot of Buddhist teachings of being in the present moment, and perhaps most importantly for this post, believe that all the major religions are pointing to a common god. When we become one with Being, we will likely become much aware in the present moment, resulting in a state of bliss. There is no talk of Hell or even afterlife, and it seemed fairly reasonable to believe. This belief made me happy for the first time in a while.\nI still hadn‚Äôt made up my mind, though. Although I like the idea above, I couldn‚Äôt be sure that it was true just yet.\nThe situation went from accepting uncertainty to absolute fear over the last day, though. Just this morning, I had the thought that if the commonality of all religions, which attempt to put this universal Being into words, is a reason for subscribing to this belief, then what other commonalities might religions share? Then the thought of hell came back. Why didn‚Äôt this teaching mention any afterlife if religions like Hinduism and Islam do? \nAgain, is eternal Hell real? Well, I‚Äôd already explored the Christian side of things and the answer I came up with was ‚Äúprobably not.‚Äù But it occurred to me that I never thought of Islam‚Äôs perspective being I was never raised around it. Islam‚Äôs teachings were very scary for me: Hell is real and even eternal for some. Additionally, the Quran is claimed to be written by Mohammad, taken straight from the mouth of God; so if Islam was ever ended up being something I believed in, there would be no way to explain Hell away: God himself said that it‚Äôs real. I would be anxious, depressed, and terrified for the rest of my life. \nI immediately took to the internet to look up counters to Islam to prove in my mind that it could not be real and so I would no longer have to worry. If Islam claims to have a perfect book told by God himself, then finding one massive error would shatter its legitimacy entirely, since either God is 100% correct or the Quran was made up. But so far, I have found nothing. In fact, it seems to have more ground to stand on than Christianity. The Quran was supposedly made due to the fact that the Bible‚Äôs teachings were just a rough collection of man-made accounts with disputable legitimacy; one of my main reasons for doubting Christianity was accounted for by Islam. Even the science held up, or could at least be argued for.\nStill, I kept looking for things to disprove it so I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry. Then I found a quote from the Quran: ‚ÄúWe shall send those who reject our revelations to the (hell) fire. When their skins have been burned away, we shall replace them with new ones so that they may continue to feel the pain.‚Äù\nThis terrifies me. If Islam turns out to be real, I‚Äôd currently be rejecting the revelations and sentenced to eternal hell. \nNow what? All I wanted was to be free of worry that my loved ones may be burned, and now I have potentially landed myself in the worst pain imaginable. Do I keep looking to disprove it? \nIf I converted, it would likely be out of fear, and I would be miserable thinking of Hell for my friends, but if I turned my back, I may be running the risk of eternal suffering, either of which I‚Äôm not even letting myself wrap my head around so I don‚Äôt completely lose it.\nIf I do keep trying to disprove it, I better strike gold. I need to be certain that all is well; I can‚Äôt just kid myself into only mostly believing Islam and it‚Äôs promise of Hell isn‚Äôt real so that I can sleep at night, while the violent nagging of ‚Äúwhat if you made the wrong decision‚Äù attacks me.\nI talked to my dad. All he knew to say is that he‚Äôs sorry I feel this way, that he loves me so so much, and that he hopes I can be happy. I love him so much too, and I don‚Äôt want to worry him or my mom. I just want to be happy again. \nThank you so much for reading. All love.",

I don‚Äôt quite understand how does it work, how do they pray? What do they believe in other than the seven Laws of Noah. These laws are already in every other religion. I mean, what‚Äôs so special about it and how is it any different from Islam or Judaism? Any people here who are noahidst or know someone who is? I don‚Äôt want to annoy him with tons of questions about his religion because I already did many times, he gave me the answers, but they‚Äôre never enough for me, I want all the details, from the beginning till now if you know what I mean. Thanks a lot in advance",
