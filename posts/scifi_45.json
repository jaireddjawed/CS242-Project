The story was probably published in the late 2000's, however this based on someone else's search for the same story.\n\nFrom what we (myself and the other searcher) can remember, the story goes roughly like this:\n\nA young man wakes inside a pod with no memory of who he was or how he arrived in the pod.  Leaving the pod, he found that he's in a lush jungle and finds a little robot or animal companion who guides him through the jungle as he flees robot pursuers.  His guide takes him to the ruins of a human city where he learns that he is able to leap across large gaps, and that he has other superhuman abilities.\n\nHe later gets captured by a group of humans and dinosaurs who take him back to their base where he learns that he is an augmented clone of one of the last humans, and he was built to stop the war between the humans and robots.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been searching for this story for so many years, I would love to finally know what the heck I read and be done searching.  Any help on this quest of mine would be amazing!",

        "author": "straightCrimpin",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/z9w1rz/why_is_the_concept_of_civilization_sized/",
        "text": "It seems that most sci-fi stories tend to look for ways of traveling faster than light in order to tell their stories, be it through warp drives, FTL drives, wormhole travel, hyperspace, or some other means. Some sci-fi stories go the more \"realistic\" route and use generation ships, but these generation ships always move at something like 10% the speed of light and take a very long time to travel from place to place.  \n\n\n[Relativistic travel](http://jick.net/skept/STR/node13.html) would allow generation ships to travel incredible distances in relatively short periods of time (by their ships clocks), and a ship which could accelerate and decelerate constantly at 1G could reach relativistic speeds quite quickly. A ship with this acceleration could travel the diameter of the galaxy and come to a complete stop in less than 30 years. The biggest drawback to this in sci-fi is the notion that these trips are always one-way. You can't leave your family behind on your home planet because tens of thousands of years would pass for them, but that's not an issue if you take your whole civilization with you.  \n\n\nSo my question is, why don't we see \"migratory civilizations\" using relativistic travel more commonly in sci-fi? I would imagine a story of a civilization that mined it's local solar system for resources, turned it's home planet into an interstellar spaceship, and then shot off into space accelerating to nearly the speed of light depositing their planet into a new star system which they would then mine for resources the same way they did their home planet. The perspective of this civilization would be unique in that they wouldn't be looking to colonize other planets necessarily, mostly just travelling from star system to star system taking the resources.  \n\n\nIt would be interesting to imagine what a civilization like this would look like. Given the implications of relativity they could be warlike and travel from place to place culling local civilizations in order to ensure that none would build the technology capable of surpassing them in the thousands of years that would pass on these local planets in-between relativistic voyages. Or they could be peaceful and use the fact that so much time is passing around them to let local civilizations build and advance their own technology ultimately trading technology and resources. You could imagine that they would travel from one side of the galaxy to the other, with each trip local civilizations advance by 100,000 years but the migrants only advance by 30 years, so they can benefit by trading with these civilizations and learning new technology that their own civilization would have taken thousands of years to develop.  \n\n\nIf anyone knows of any sci-fi stories like this let me know. I'm curious to see what they look like.",

        "text": "  \n\nDecember 1st, 2022\n\nGood news, bad news.  The good news is that the radiation storm ended.  It started trending down at 04:38 UTC and by 11:00 UTC it was over.  I used the head, ate three Skor bars, and thanked god for turning off the microwave oven.\n\nBad news, NASA had absolutely done the math on radiation levels and by 11:30 UTC Mark got on the radio to give me the results.\n\n“There’s no easy way to say this Alex, but our health sciences division is telling me you got enough radiation that there’s a 43% chance you’ll develop cancer because of it.  That’s a lifetime risk mind.  We’re not talking about today or tomorrow or next year even.  But you’re going to need to keep a close eye on your health and if it happens, catch it as early as you can.”\n\nI went to space and all I got was this lousy tumor.  They had probably been giving this a few days of thought, because if you could tell me one thing that might have made that news go down a bit easier, it was what Mark said next.\n\n“One day we really are going to have science-fiction worthy starships, but it’s going to cost hundreds, maybe even thousands, of lives for us to learn the lessons we need to learn to build them.  No matter how careful, there’s always trial and error Alex.  Thanks to you, we know we have to do more for radiation protection.  That’s a lesson we were going to learn the hard way sooner or later, and you just saved a whole crew from being in the same position as you are right now.  You’ve helped humanity get a step closer to the future we all want.”\n\n43%.  Not a bad trade for helping all of humanity, is it?  You know the funny thing?  We judge ourselves based on outcomes.  If I actually get cancer I’m probably going to look back on this and think it was pretty stupid.  If I don’t then this is clearly the coolest thing I ever did.  If the rocket blew up on launch - stupid.  If aliens docked with Orion and I got to make first contact - brilliant.  \n\nThere’s a formula:  If **\\[something outside of my control\\]** happens, then **\\[my actions\\]** are **\\[good / bad\\]**.  How does that equation make sense?  Does that mean there are people sitting at home right now who are every bit as amazing and smart and insightful as Elon Musk, but random chance delivered them failure, and that’s how they see themselves?  Failures?  For want of luck?\n\nMark noticed the long pause.  NASA did their absolute best to keep me too busy to dwell on things for the rest of the day.  They even sent me a book and had a suggestion for the evening that sounded pretty fun to me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n“This is Alex Whelm, and for the next hour we’ll be spinning classic hits that just keep hitting and taking your calls from the moon.”  Nasa’s the switchboard, and this broadcast is going out live, world-wide.  \n\nSpace disk jockey!  I love it.  \n\nNASA even got permission from Adele (did you hear that we’ve all been pronouncing her name wrong?  It’s Uh - Dale not ah - Dell), and CCR (my dad’s favorite) for us to play some of their songs between questions.  And so, in compliance with NASA’s contractual license obligations, I’d like to thank Adele and CCR for their generous support of space exploration and discovery.  I wonder if I’m going to be shilling for Skor when I get back to Earth?  As long as I don’t have to eat another one.\n\n“Artemis, this is Mike from Denver.  How are you feeling up there?”\n\n“Hey Mike from Denver.  I’m alright.  Glowing in the dark a little, but with advances in modern medicine I could live another fifty, maybe even sixty, minutes.  Seriously though I’m ok.  Just a lot of doctors trips in the future so if anything happens we catch it early.  I snuck into the unknown and that means taking some chances, right?”\n\n“Artemis, this is Sarah from Long Beach.  Have you talked to Jess since you’ve been up there?  Any chance you’ll patch things up?”\n\n“Hey Sarah.  If your grill’s uncovered you should watch out, I see some weather moving in on you!”  I click off the radio and take a breath.  You’re allowed to do that you know.  Pause, think about things, no one’s ever going to penalize you for taking five seconds to think, unless you’re on Jeopardy.\n\n“You ever go out for New Years Eve to some big party?  That’s a lot like a relationship.  Everyone thinks of the countdown, the fireworks, the kiss, and honestly you could pretty well take any two random people, stick them together, and imagine them having a dang good time for the big five minutes.  But when you actually do go out for New Years Eve it’s totally different.  It’s hours figuring out your plans for the night, getting dressed to go out, driving to the party, finding parking which is both hard and expensive.  Then there’s hours and hours waiting around before midnight.  When you head home it’s fighting a traffic jam.  You’re tired, and everyone’s driving badly around you.”\n\n“All that other stuff - that’s life.  You really, really, really, need to fit together with a person if you’re going to enjoy being stuck in traffic with them, or searching for parking, or waiting in line for an over-priced drink.  If you’ve still got stuff to talk with them about, laugh with them about, joke about, after all the cliched new years stuff has been said.  Jess didn’t think we clicked that way, and honestly I was so swept up in how much fun I had with her for the countdown, that I wasn’t thinking about how compatible we really were once the fireworks stopped.  But if we weren’t clicking for her, then by definition we weren’t clicking.  It sucks, but… yeah.”\n\n“Artemis this is Brad from Kansas.  I hear you’re reading science fiction up there.  Any recommendations?”\n\n“I surely do Brad.  NASA was kind enough to send me a new release.  Just out today.  Woe to the Victor.  You can probably guess I’m a hard sci-fi fan and this has been scratching that itch!”\n\nDid you know Tom Clancy got his start because Ronald Reagan was reading the Hunt for Red October and got asked for a book recommendation?  Anyways, I hope Nathan H. Green appreciates the free global publicity.  I should get a cut, I’m unemployed after all.\n\n“Artemis, this is Cathy from Sarasota.  But you really loved Jess.  Everyone’s saying how sweet your love letters to her are, and the launch was so delayed you only tried to stow away after the break up.  I think it’s super romantic you were trying to win her back by doing this huge thing.”\n\nExcuse me?  Jess released the letters I wrote her?  The fuck.  \n\n“Sarah from Long Beach, this is Artemis.  I didn’t know those letters were out in the world.”\n\n“Artemis, this is Sam from Palm Springs.  After your Oprah interview a British tabloid published a bunch of your letters and cards to Jess.  She’s saying it was her room mate who sold them.  I’m wondering what it felt like to have to fly the Orion yourself.  You had no idea what you were doing?”\n\nThere’s no good way to be angry in outer space.  You can’t pace.  You *really* shouldn’t punch anything.  I’m also pretty sure complaining on the radio to the whole world isn’t a good idea.\n\n‘Alex Whelm goes on profanity filled rant,’ isn’t a good headline for NASA.  ‘Alex Whelm threatens Tabloid Boss,’ isn’t great either.  And, by the way, thanks NASA! \n\n“Hey Sam.  Thanks for that.  I didn’t know.  Let me answer your questions first though.”  Better to give myself a few seconds to cool.\n\n“I had absolutely zero idea how to fly Orion myself.  I mean there are joysticks that look like they are flight controls, but you’d have exactly as good an idea of how to do it as me.  So, it felt crazy dangerous.”\n\n“On the letters…  I guess I should think about Jess in this.  I’m the one who went and did something crazy, and I should probably accept whatever media stuff is going to come from it.  I can’t really complain right?  But Jess doesn’t deserve any of that, and if Katie really did sell those letters, I’m sure Jess is feeling really betrayed and hurt.”\n\n“Artemis, Rasham from Tampa.  You really think you shouldn’t go to jail yo?  My bud Max snuck into an old power plant, and he got ten years.  You like, stole a spaceship.”\n\nWow, I really pissed off someone in NASA PR.  \n\n“Hey, Rasham.  Well, it isn’t up to me right.  There’s going to be a judge who ends up deciding what should happen to me just like everyone else.  But I also think that almost everyone can think of many, many, times when something happens with the courts that just doesn’t seem fair, or right, and that’s a big problem.  Things should be fair, and I think most of us don’t think they are, or at least, worry that maybe they aren’t.”\n\n“Anyways folks we’re going to take a break for some music, and then I’ll be back to answer more of your questions!”\n\nYou can think about the human brain in two ways.  If you’re a Star Trek optimist, then you can think about it like Microsoft Word.  It’s a tool that can be used for an infinite variety of tasks, but it still has some order and form that can influence how it works, and how efficiently, or inefficiently, it handles different things.    \n\nIf you’re a Black Mirror pessimist, the human mind is much more like the computer at an auto-repair shop.  It is so specialized for the tasks of gathering berries and hunting elk, that you’re always having to find work-arounds to handle anything even slightly non-standard and if someone came into the shop and said “hey can you use this computer to help manage an intergalactic treaty negotiation?”  The shop would just have to say no, sorry, this software can’t do that.\n\nSo, which is true?  I’m super, super, super pissed off and just want to cuss everyone out.  But I also know that would be wrong to do and that I shouldn’t.  Am I MS Word and I can just write a few more nice sentences, even though for some reason it keeps trying to autocorrect “NASA” to “those assholes”.  Or am I the auto-repair shop computer system and we’re just going to have to live with the fact the customer name’s been changed from ‘NASA’ to ‘Asshole’ and the system won’t let us change it back.\n\n“Alex,” Mark’s voice cuts in over the radio.  “The broadcast’s on music, we’re off the air.  I’m so sorry about that.  Those questions never should have gotten up to you.  You did a great job dealing with it though.”\n\nI exhale.  Other people can do a lot to make it easier to be MS Word.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H. Green, a science-fiction writer with a degree in aerospace engineering, and I’m going to be doing daily semi-fictional stories tracking the Artemis I mission.  You can follow along through my reddit (u/authornathanhgreen). \n\nArtemis I Has A Stowaway is a work of semi-fiction. All incidents, events, dialogue and sentiments (which are not part of the mission’s official history), are entirely fictional. Where real historical figures appear, the situations, incidents, sentiments, and dialogues concerning those persons are entirely fictional and are not intended to depict actual events, personality, disposition, or attitudes of the real person, nor to change the entirely fictional nature of the work. Save the above, any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.\n\n© 2022 Nathan H. Green",

I've recently been working on an animated overview of the model. So far, I've just completed the animation for the version based on [how the stargate appeared in the original movie](https://www.gian-cursio.net/2021/02/stargate-2020-film-showcase/), but animations for the [SG-1](https://www.gian-cursio.net/2021/03/stargate-2020-sg1-showcase/) and [Atlantis](https://www.gian-cursio.net/2021/07/stargate-2020-sga-showcase/) version of the model are forthcoming. Hopefully, before the end of the 30 Days of Stargate event.\n\nFellow 3D artists, the model is available for download on my website if you follow the above links in multiple formats, I love seeing what people can do with it.",

        "text": "Bizarre and relatively interesting low budget movie starring GOT’s own Ramsey Bolton sporting Draco Malloy hair and pale blue/white contacts that made me question whether or not he was actually human.\n\n57 years ago humans were driven underground when aliens invaded and eliminated 95% of the population.  Some still live on the surface and soldiers topside are encouraged/required to report any “stragglers” they encounter so they can be brought underground “for their own safety.”\n\nProtagonist is a soldier named SUM1 who’s guarding a remote outpost above ground from the threat of alien incursion after his predecessor was suddenly taken ill.  His term of service is 100 days and he’s on his own except for a white rat he discovers and befriends. Twice a day he checks in with the disembodied voices of what I assume are his superiors to report. \n\nI noticed near the end, though, as he became more and more convinced the aliens were a lie/propaganda by the government to control the lesser economic classes, that his contacts were gone and he now had normal looking blue eyes.  \n\nAllegory for the scales falling from his eyes? Or something else?  Considering that the protagonist is literally called “Someone” and the aliens are called “Nonesuch” I think this is a likely hypothesis.  However, I can find nothing online addressing this at all.  It’s almost as if nobody else has noticed that bit about his eyes.  \n\nIf any of you have seen this movie and have any ideas of your own, I’d like to hear them.",

        "text": "November 30th, 2022\n\nHow hungry do you need to be to take a 1% chance of getting cancer in return for some chocolate bars?  I’d left my Skor bars back at my cot, and the thought of wading through a sea of deadly radiation to get them has kept me hungry.  Well, NASA’s also been perfectly clear that I’m to sit exactly where I am no matter what.  \n\nThus, I’ve also peed my pants.  Three times.  You know what they don’t have onboard Artemis I?  A washing machine, or a wardrobe.  I’m going to be stuck with these clothes for the rest of the mission.\n\nNASA’s been trying to figure out the source of this radiation storm to get a handle on when it might pass, but when it comes to space weather, they’re in the dark. \n\nAnyways with the radiation sensor exposed to the full power of the storm I can watch its progress.  Since yesterday it’s done nothing but go up.  650,000 𝝻Sv/hr with the “little numbers” changing so fast I can’t read them.  \n\nI am back in touch with NASA though.  They very helpfully let me know that, if not for the water tank radiation shield, I would be in fatal doses of radiation within hours territory, and yet I don’t see anything around me reacting.  You could forget it was happening if not for this tingling on your teeth like they’re dirty.  Then again, my teeth are dirty, I hadn’t thought to bring a tooth brush.\n\nThere’s some house keeping work that NASA is handling.  The Orion’s orbit around the moon is causing some fluctuations in orientation that NASA’s had to updated the flight controls to handle.  The computer freeze resulted in a few missed correction burns that they’ve been trying to figure out how to make up for.  They’re upset I used so much fuel figuring out where the radiation came from.  Blah, blah, blah.  Mark straight up told me they still have more than enough fuel to get me home - so this is all just worrying for nothing.  \n\nThey claim to be busy.  I’m just sitting, without even a book to read or a gage to be checked.  \n\nThe other thing is that I asked NASA a question this morning, and they haven’t answered.  \n\n“Hey guys, just how strong can this storm get before my water-tank radiation shield won’t be enough?”\n\n“We’re doing the math on that now Alex.  Let you know just as soon as we can,” Mark said.\n\nThen silence.  As though I forgot.  As though that isn’t the only thing on my mind.  Well, I guess they accomplished that, now I’m also thinking about why they aren’t answering.\n\nThey did tell me to change up my little radiation vest fort, taking off the one I was wearing and using it as a headrest.  That’s a nice thought, that the water tank isn’t giving me enough protection on its own to shield my brain.  \n\nAssuming I don’t just die of this, I’m starting to think I’m definitely going to get cancer.\n\nYou know the worst part about cancer?  The hope.  If you just told me I had 6 months before I’d need constant care, and after 1 years I’d be dead, then I’d make the six months count.\n\nI’d party it up like crazy, then I’d go off into the woods with a spear and have a fight with a grizzly bear.  I’d want to arrive at heaven and have God say, “dude, why would you have done that?!”\n\nBy the way, Jess *hated* that idea.\n\nWith cancer you’ve got that hope.  Treatments, experimental drugs, surgeries, five year survival rates with double digit percentages.  But really, almost always, you’re actually talking about spending the last months, and years, of your life thinking about nothing but your health, always sick and feeling terrible, and getting more and more worn down until one day you just… stop.\n\nI know this is a personal thing, and honestly to each their own, I don’t judge.  But I spent my whole life hoping for long shots to pay off.  That I’d be an astronaut, go into space, maybe even be the first person on Mars or something amazing like that.  I’m sick of hope.  So fuck cancer.\n\nAnyways, frequently asked questions about using your drinking water as a radiation shield: if the water is absorbing the radiation, won’t it get radioactive?  I got a lot of days left in this mission and drinking water is non-negotiable.  \n\nWelcome to radiation shields 101 with your host: the guy who’s logicing this shit out right now.  So first of all, “radiation”, in the common usage, is really just a catchall term for a whole bunch of different “particles” that can damage human cells.    \n\nUranium isn’t radiation - uranium gives off radiation.  There are all different types of radiation but as one example gamma rays, and x-rays, are just light, regular photons like what come out of a flashlight - just at different frequencies.  ‘But light doesn’t damage things!’ ah but it does given time and intensity.  Haven’t you seen a piece of paper that’s left in the sun get yellowed over time?  Well imagine that’s your DNA.  Turns out as you change the frequency of light you also change how well it can penetrate materials and the damage it does to DNA.  Steel, which is totally opaque to the visible light spectrum, is like glass to x-rays.  \n\nIn the case of gamma rays or x-rays the photons hit the water molecules shed their energy into heat and are gone.  So the water isn’t radioactive, it is just warmer.  If you shine a flashlight onto a swimming pool it won’t charge up and start to glow when you shut off the light, so if you shine x-rays onto the pool it won’t start glowing back x-rays.  And yes, for you overly eager students in the front row, the water will start to glow but in the harmless infrared spectrum. \n\nBut there are other kinds of radiation as well that involve protons or other subatomic particles.  Again though, it isn’t about those particles simple existence, it’s about their speed.  You bump them into something and get rid of that speed and they become inert.  \n\nSo, the way I see it, a radiation shield should work by putting atoms between me and the radiation source.  The particles of radiation cascade in, hit the atoms of the shield, and lose their energy going from deadly radiation to harmless slow moving particles.  My water stays safe to drink, and I don’t get cancer.\n\nRiddle me this though: why is the water in a nuclear reactor radioactive?  The uranium is encased, so what’s getting into the water that is radioactive?  I remember something about neutron flux from a documentary…  But I can’t remember the details.  I ask NASA, they promise to get back to me.\n\nRegardless, by inference this all means that blocking radiation is a % thing.  For such and such a thickness of water X% of the particles that make up the radiation should pass through, missing the water’s atoms, and then hit my two radiation blocking vests on the chair, and the two panels of the vest I’m now using as a head-rest.  \n\nWhen I was messing about with the Orion’s orientation to try and figure out where the radiation was coming from, the radiation sensor basically dropped down to zero.  Say 99% radiation blocking.  The vests, specially designed for this, figure they’re 60% shields, each panel.  And there are 4 panels between my chest and the radiation source.  So, 0.4, 0.24, 0.142, 0.0852%.  That means I’m blocking 99.9148% of the radiation. \n\nThat sounds pretty darn good, until you consider how small and pathetic us humans are compared to the grandeur of the universe.  650,000 𝝻Sv/hr is what the radiation sensor is reading, so call it about 580 𝝻Sv/hr that’s getting through the shield.  The alarm triggered at 130 𝝻Sv/hr.  Fantastic.  Just fantastic.\n\nI bet a real astronaut would be sitting here and just thinking heroic, stoic, thoughts.  They wouldn’t be imagining dying in a hospital bed from radiation poisoning or wondering how getting fired from NASA affects their health insurance.  How long do you have after you get fired to sign up for COBRA?  And, by the way, what's with that name?  That's like naming a program to feed the homeless FAMINE.  Where do you even find a bear?  \n\nA real astronaut would just be quietly sitting here, maybe looking out the window at the unmoving pinprick stars and thinking about their training or the mission.  \n\nThey’d probably be thinking that this cloud of radiation is from two black holes slamming into one another, and even after traveling for millions of years, it is still strong enough to kill us puny humans.  \n\nI’m hungry, my underwear is wet and clammy, and all I can think about is what a frail, pathetic, stupid, idiot I am.\n\nSeriously, my biggest accomplishment in life was basically figuring out how to do a magic trick where I swapped out the dummy Moonikin for the bigger dummy ‘the amazing radioactive Alex!’\n\nI’m not very good company today.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H. Green, a science-fiction writer with a degree in aerospace engineering, and I’m going to be doing daily semi-fictional stories tracking the Artemis I mission.
