Also figuring out ways I can make my life easier. I don’t really see a point in pursuing a formal diagnosis as I don’t think it would do much for me considering the effort and cost it would take. \n\nIf anyone can suggest some sources or share your own experiences with self or formal diagnosis I would really appreciate it.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! (English isn't my first language so sorry for any mistake) \n\nAs most people here I've been researching the possibility of having autism, so I started remembering how when I was younger, around 6 to 8yo, I saw some child psychologists, and also I was for a while in a special class at school (for people with learning disabilities and such), so I asked my mother if she remembered why I was put on those sort of things.\n\nTo make the long story short, one of my teachers told her to put me in therapy because I just had to have some sort of learning disability, that I was different, so that's what my mom did, and after some meetings with a few doctors, psychologists, other teachers, everyone said the same, \"don't worry, she's just to smart! she's just a bit lazy, but all kids are!\", my mom repeated this many times while she was recounting this, \"you couldn't have anything because you were smart!\" \n\nSo... I guess what I'm trying to say is... I mean I identify with all the symptoms, I've actually been reading \"unmasking autism\" and relate so much to everything the author says! Reading through this community finally feels like everything \"clicks\", everything makes sense... but if this is true. how come nobody noticed before? I think I had every opportunity to be diagnosed if I am actually autistic...\n\nAnyway sorry for the long post, but I just wanted some opinions, maybe this is all in my head, I don't know... Thankyou for reading though! :)",

        "text": "I'm still trying to figure out if I'm autistic. \n\n \\* I can't get the idea that I'm autistic out of my head, and whenever I convince myself I'm not, something brings me back in (An unlocked memory, if you call it) When you were trying to figure out if you had autism, was it the only thing you can think about throughout the entire day? Because it's like that for me. I simply can't get out of my head, butI'm also scarede, because I don't think I am? \n\nI don't know. It's weird because all my life I go to two states. The realistic one and the really weird one. The realistic one can feel the serious consequences of their actions and feels 'present', the other one is just me being stuck in my head all day with my weird monologues. I'm usually the second one. \n\nBut whenever I want to empathize with someone or look into another person's shoes realistically, I would imagine two stick figures. And then I would add words to them to that so they can feel 'real'.  Mostly because putting myself in their situation doesn't help. \n\nLike....\"What this person is going through is obviously sad, but I don't feel sad for them.\"\n\nAnd then I start to imagine the two stick figures to feel some emotion. It was my way of 'putting myself in their shoes\n\nAlso, does anyone have weird facial expressions? When I was younger I learned that a close family friend died, and I couldn't stop myself from smiling when I heard that. I also hated myself for not being sad when I heard that they died.\n\nWhat was even worse was that at their funeral I couldn't stop smiling. When we had to walk up to their coffin I waved at the corpse while biting my cheek because I wanted some action to distract myself from smiling (which didn't work)\n\nI smiled when I learned that my aunt died (And again, felt nothing), and I was scared to show my face around my family members when my uncle died because I knew that I would start smiling. \n\nSpeaking about facial expressions, did anyone else teach themselves how to smile? I remember smiling when I was a baby, but I also remember wondering why people smiled or laughed. At least when I was younger. \n\n\"What does a natural smile feel like? Do people just smile on purpose or something?\"\n\nI don't know why I was thinking that because I'm pretty sure I used to smile and laugh when I was younger. But for some reason, I also remember smiling manually. Like...straight up teaching myself how to smile. I think I did it at the carnival. \n\nI was like \"This is a happy occasion. Just smile like everybody else\"\n\nAnd then it was just...a new trick I learned. I remember being so proud that I can smile without feeling like smiling. I used to show it off as a child, like smiling at adults for no reason but felt discouraged that they didn't notice I can smile on command. \n\nThen I learned that smiling at people can have positive effects so then I smiled all the time when talking to people because whenever I was deadpan, or just neutral, people would ask what was wrong with me.\n\nit was only recently (like three or four years ago) That I remember a smile just coming on, at the appropriate time, and just letting it happen. It felt nice.  Now I do it all the time when I feel happy, and it feels like such an award, you know? A smile where I don't consciously lift any muscles AND at appropriate times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd do people get tired when talking to others? If I spent time with my cousins for a good five hours, or a day, I'd feel too tired to talk for the next. Or worse, annoyed because I feel like I spent enough time with them for them to be satisfied.  Once my social interaction time reaches a threshold, I would just hide out playing games for the rest of the day alone, because I love my alone time. (My cousins always called me anti-social, lazy, mean, and boring for that)\n\nI do this with my friendships as well. Like they're just pets that I need to spend a certain time with until I feel like they need more attention, or I need social interaction. My mom told me that I'm a horrible friend because I don't spend enough time with people, and my sister told me that she wouldn't want to be my friend. Am I a horrible friend for needing more time alone than others? Should I just force myself to spend time with them when I don't feel like it?\n\nRestaurants were even worse. Loud noises don't bother me, but if you get me in a public place full of people, I will fall asleep in the car afterward. Does anyone else do that?\n\nAlso, I remember, when I was a kid, I was given a book to read. I had tutoring in an hour at my school, but I was excited to read the book that I completely forgot about my tutoring, and read almost half of the book in the afternoon. My parents were understandably angry, and I remember constantly thinking about the book until I finished it, I felt incapable of putting the book down. Is that hyper-focusing or normal?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all I have.",

        "text": "Many people have mentioned to me that I could be autistic, and the more that people say it the more I can see it! Tell me what you guys think\n\nI've always been unsociable, and feeling like I don't fit in at any social events, and it feels like I'm a different person when interacting with different people. I barely recognise the person I see in the mirror and I feel like a freak, an alien or just an outcast, or all three at the same time. I hate anything unorganised or messy, it just really annoys me and I have an urge to just go clean it up, and I can't focus when things are messy. In social situations I basically always avoid eye contact, its absolutely terrifying. Even making eye contact with someone from across the room in school creeps me out a lot. In school, on my way to classes, I usually see my friends and I find it really difficult to smile and say hello properly without being indecisive whether to wave, say hello, smile at them or do something else. \n\nI'm really sensitive, and I detest loud noises, most of the time they give me panic attacks or anxiety attacks and it's so annoying. I have to cover my ears and even then I can still hear everything. Last Spring, I used to go to the library for some quiet space, and about 400 feet/120 metres away was a traffic light, and I could hear it every time it went off. I could also hear conversations outside, I couldn't make out what people were saying, but I could still hear it. Another time, I was in English class just writing some stuff down, and I could hear a pillar drill or something downstairs. It was kind of faint, but the person next to me couldn't hear it when I asked them. People always say that I'm too quiet, but I feel like I'm talking loud/shouting when I talk at a normal volume. Direct sunlight for too long can give me headaches, but I guess thats more sleep deprivation and bad eyesight. Sometimes I feel like the sun is just more or less bright than usual and it's super weird. I have a sensitivity to pain, so I have to act like a punch dosen't hurt much when it hurts like hell. \n\nSometimes its easy for me to read people's feelings, like its a language I can read, or just feel from them. It only works with certain people and other people are much harder to read. It sounds weird to say but I feel like its a superpower.\n\nI feel like I don't fit in anywhere, and I'll always just be out of place and it annoys me so much. I moved schools and house in the same year, so once I was somewhat used to moving houses, I had to deal with another change, and I had a lot of trouble making friends. Even now, a year and a half later, I still don't feel like I fit in. As of lately, I feel like my friends hate me and I can't tell my friends about it, because obviously. \n\nFor some reason, I find immense comfort in music. I can handle silence, but music always just helps me calm down, and theres basically always a song playing in my head, even when I don't know that its there. \n\nI've taken online tests, and I know they aren't accurate, but for the majority of them they say that I have mild to severe autism, but I don't know if it's true or not. I'm too scared to ask my parents to get a test because I'm scared that I'll be judged for being autistic if I actually am. \n\nWhat do you guys think? And sorry for the really long post",

        "text": "So I'm a recently self dx'd autistic/ADHD, and there's a bit of a chance my spouse is on the spectrum as well. We clicked so strongly as soon as we started dating, we're practically inseparable and just love each other's company. I've really wondered if we're experiencing the 'autistic resonance' that some people talk about online. But if we start trying to have any kind of conversation that touches on serious matters, when either of us is really tired/stressed, it changes. \n\nWe both have trauma that we're in therapy working on, so that definitely plays a role. But the way my brain kind of stops working and the things that I'll say, and really regret, it just feels so out of my control while we're in the midst of it. I can't focus, things feel like there's tremendous pressure, I'm self aware that my thoughts are racing and I kind of know what's happening, but if I'm tired it feels like I just can't get myself in check.\n\nI've read some posts here and there about ADHD harshness, but I don't understand what that is. I know to my gut, for me, it feels like preventing stress buildup and fatigue is the only way to manage what happens with me. I'm still working with my therapist and I'm slightly better at preventing harsh comments, but I feel like continuing that work will only get me so far.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why I think I have a disability and wish I was formally diagnosed. I want know if I'm being selfish or immature thinking this should be OK, but I'd like to be able to say something like, \"I'm too tired/overwhelmed for that kind of discussion right now. It's going to be very hard for me to regulate my emotions and have a productive discussion, so please ask me later.\" \n\nThis is hard, because in a relationship it's a little unfair to shut down discussions because it's invalidating. My partner wants to be heard, and I'm basically saying I can't hear her right now. It's not that I don't want to listen and help  though, it feels like I can't. I feel like if this is more of a trauma thing, it will slowly improve over months and years of work. But if it's also AuDHD driven, we may need to acknowledge and account for a very real mental and physiological limit. I don't know if that's even a thing. \n\nI'm very new to this and I don't want to kind of use my disability in a selfish way, so what do you think this is and what kind of accomodation is reasonable to expect?",

        "text": "\nI’m 22 and diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I have a really hard time expressing my feelings. The symptoms I lost below, I haven’t been able to explain it during my past therapy sessions. I’m planning on writing these down and giving it to my psychiatrist in my next visit. I desperately feel alone and want to know if anyone experiences these issues. \n__\n\nIn the middle of a conversation I will just zone out. I get quiet and feel a lost of energy and just want to be alone and notice I start speaking very quietly basically like whispering. I don’t know why this happens\n\nI seem to always make things about myself in conversations it’s the only way I know how to relate but my friends have noticed and they say it’s quite annoying \n\n\nI take a lot of things literal and don’t know when someone is serious or joking \n\nEveryone says my humor isn’t funny and quite confusing, I guess the way I see things are very different to others.\n\nI find it so hard to do simple things. My room can never stay organized. First, it takes me ages to bring myself to clean and then a few days later it’s suddenly messy again and it’s just an ongoing cycle. The problem is I see the mess and I really want to clean up but I can’t bring myself to do it. And when I finally do it , it makes me feel so exhausted. L\n\nI can be very decisive and impulsive. My friends have mentioned a lot how I say things without thinking and sometimes it’s blunt and quite rude. \n\nI also forget what I had just said like a minute before moving on to another topic. \n\nI have trouble recognizing people’s facial expressions and tones. Sometimes I can’t tell whether people are happy or upset with me. And people always say it’s hard to interact with me because the things I say they never know if I’m joking or serious because my facial expressions and tone are out of sync.\n\n\nI go through so many phases of hyper focusing on things and it’s something I can’t stop thinking about until I wind up losing interest. And I ramble on about it and talk about it as much as I can with friends and family. It’s quite embarrassing but I can’t help myself.\n\nWhen I get excited I flap my hands and jump up and down. I know it looks childish so I try not to. \n\nWhen I’m stressed I need to fidget with my fidget toys but they don’t seem to help much. The way I can explain it is that I feel like I have electricity running through me and there’s no way to let it out. I feel irritable a lot of the time because I don’t know how to explain how it feels inside my body and brain. \n\n\n\nSometimes I randomly feel like I need to cry  \n\nBig crowds overwhelm me, not because I’m scared of people it just feels like too much going on around me with noise,  lights and people. \n\nI like to plan things ahead of time. I don’t like when plans are changed.\n\nI get attached to people so easily like a child and I hate it so much\n\nIt’s very hard for me to finish any assignment up until the last minute. No matter if I enjoy it or don’t the only thing that pushes me is until the last few minutes it’s due.\n\nI go from one extreme to the other. For example I can be very excited to extremely disappointed. If I get critiqued on something I go and do the complete opposite I don’t know how to be balanced. \n\nI find it hard to follow instructions with more than one step involved, unless clearly laid out in written form. I require everyone to be very clear with me, otherwise I won't feel able to complete a task. I know this will only get worst once I get a job if I can even get one",

I’m at the point when I’m certain that I have broader autistic traits and a lot of symptoms towards adhd too. \n\nI’ve struggle with depression and anxiety near enough my whole life, particularly depression. I’ve got a history of self harm. I used to cut myself, but haven’t done that in years. \n\nBut I still get these urges in times of stress to slap myself. It’s a lot of rapid slaps to my face, thigh, back of the head… this can sometimes be scratching too. \n\nSo right now I did it because long story short my partner had some bad news and hid himself in bed, I got frustrated because I couldn’t help, I made his situation worse by pushing myself too much… and now I’ve gone for a walk and I couldn’t even focus on which direction to take so I ended up screaming and punching my own head. \n\nWhen I self harmed before, it was with a blade, it was controlled in the sense only did it in secret, it was in hidden places on my body, and although there were a lot to of cuts and they all drew blood I never went deep enough to warrant hospitalisation. And once healed I was able to cover them up with a tattoo. \n\nIt feels different than todays situation. And the many other situations when I’m fighting the urge to slap myself when the world gets flipped without notice. Like, there’s no planning or discretion, I’m not tempted to use a blade, but there are similarities in that both happen when it gets too much. It’s not like the intent is to hurt myself as it was in the past, it’s more like a compulsion to shake myself into gear, or to sweep the bad feelings way. I get the same feeling when I break down screaming. \n\nI’m wondering whether this is a me thing or a spectrum thing. Can anyone relate? I hate the feeling of losing control and being lost, and the worst part is I made my partners day worse by laying me compulsion to help onto him. Like, ffs he was having a shit time and I’ve made it all about me, making it worse.\n\nI thought I’d have grown out of hurting myself by now. I can’t make sense of anything. All I’ve done is made things worse for lot being able to control myself. \n\nThank you \n\nAlun.",

I almost feel like I need to just SCREAM really loud and get my happiness out there or else I'll explode from emotion overload. I definitely don't want to jump to conclusions and say this may be a sign I'm on the spectrum but its something I have a hard time dealing with so any explanations or ways to deal would be super helpful :D.",

        "text": "Hi everyone\n\nSo, I've been sauntering vaguely downwards into an Internet/Reddit hole (haha rabbit hole get it) about autism the past week or so. I relate to a lot of autistic experiences, have a lot of traits, and tests on embraceautism all indicated I'm probably autistic, although I won't go into it now else I'd break character limit and nobody will read the post. **I think I meet all of the DSM-5 sections A and B criteria, except for A.2, the one about differences in nonverbal communication.** \n\n* I gesture when I talk, with my hands vaguely up and in front of me, the way a lot of people do. I point to things as I'm explaining a question. \n* I've never noticed having to make any effort to read body language. I think it comes naturally, I've never made any effort to study body language/psychology/etc, and I don't find myself analysing somebody's movements the way some autistic people describe. **I don't struggle to know how people are feeling from their nonverbal cues.** \n* I took the RMET for interest's sake. I got 28, which to my understanding is average for NT people, although I know the test is not diagnostic. I did find that for a lot of the questions I was thinking \"This person is just staring at me. Well, so it's not disgusted, it's not...\" and so forth, although it didn't take a lot of time/effort to think it through.\n* I draw a lot of stylised people in various poses, and I've had anime phases. So I definitely know what body language corresponds to what emotion in art. I have to look up references for drawing open mouths of any variety but that's just a I'm-bad-at-drawing-mouths thing.\n* I don't have a monotone/exaggerated voice in conversation. I unconsciously pitch my voice up when being polite. (It frustrates me when this happens because I'm nonbinary AFAB and talking high-pitched upsets my dysphoria)\n* A long list of observations about eye contact, that don't really go anywhere at all:\n   * I never noticed any eye-contact problems before I started thinking about it. I can look into people's eyes and it's fine? When my teachers (I am in high school) are lecturing I can look at their eyes and it doesn't feel weird, although I normally doodle on my page or watch the board instead of watching their faces. Sometimes when I'm looking at someone's face I find my gaze on their brow or their mouth instead of their eyes, although I might be imagining this. \n   * Pre-rabbit hole, I remember tendency to observe a speaker's pose and gestures, what they're wearing, their hair, jewellery, etc, and clothing creases (those things can be hard to draw so I need to collect data). I notice when someone has a funky beard, blinks a lot, or talks with big mouth movements, etc. \n   * When listening to someone talk I'm happy to stare at their face. When I'm asking a question and I haven't rehearsed it, or I've been asked a question and I haven't rehearsed the answer, I feel less deer-in-the-headlights if I look past someone instead of at their face. I had a mock interview a few months ago, and the feedback was that I broke eye-contact sometimes but it always returned. Thinking back, I'm pretty sure I was looking past the interviewer at the window when answering but looking at her face when she was asking a question. \n   * I've noticed in the past that I don't really look at my mum's face when I am happy and spending time with her, even though she is my favourite person. I have this friend, somewhat close, who stares into my eyes sometimes and it unsettles me. It's probably a personal space thing though, because she leans very close and I like my space. \n* When I was very young I used to wave by making a chopping motion. People often (not recently, although it might be because I wear face masks) ask me if I'm sad or angry when it's just my face and I'm feeling fine. These are really the only things I can think of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TLDR my question is, if my nonverbal communication is pretty NT, should I stop looking into autism as a possible explanation for me being the way I am**, since you have to meet all the section A criteria to qualify for diagnosis? I don't notice difficulty with nonverbals, so it can't just be masking, can it?\n\nI think self-dx is valid but I care about the diagnostic criteria because autism is a medical thing and I can't let myself believe I am something that I'm not. If you have opinions about any of this, experiences that are related, etc, please share because I'm pretty confused right now.",

It's weird to explain but I'll give my current situation:\n\nI LOVE Hadestown, it's been my fixation for 5 months, I know almost every fact about the show and I listened to the album more times than I can count. But here's the thing, I feel very guilty when I want to do something related to Hadestown. If YouTube recommends something about the subject, I'll feel shame or guilt for thinking of clicking the video and I don't know why, so I try to ignore it. The same for hearing the music, I feel the same.\n\nI don't know if it might be a trauma of mine? Or maybe I'm growing tired of it? I still love consuming any type of media related to Hadestown, but when I have to make the decision, I stutter and have doubts. Maybe it's the fact that I fear when I get *really* excited about it and my mind just numbs itself and only pays attention to the content I'm watching.\n\nI feel like I should be more enthusiastic about it, and I am when I am consuming or talking about things from Hadestown, but I don't know if I should be feeling this.\n\nIdk, is this an hyperfixation? Does anyone have the same (or a similar) problem?",

        "text": "I’ve suspected for a while that I could possibly be autistic. Its only the past year Ive heard people talk about their experiences with autism and only the past few days Ive been open with myself about the topic. My whole life I’ve felt drained, so many things that are common and normal are so hard for me but I’ve almost always been able to adapt to the people around me and fit in. People never believe me when I say how I have such a hard time being social or doing other things that from the outside I seem to do well or at least fit in just enough to be labeled as quirky at most. Honestly even for myself I’ve never considered autism because I can force myself to fit in enough. Ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since a young age but am not medicated. Ive always chalked my problems up to that.\n\nI’m 26f and I still don’t have my license to drive. It’s something I’ve always tried to accomplish because I’ve always lived in places where a car is needed for any independence. Due to different circumstances, i’ve never taken the test. The past couple months I’ve been determined to get my license I want to have more independence and quite frankly I’m looked down on by others for not having it. Driving scares me, I live in a semi rural area with very high speed limits and two lane highways. There are constant fatalities from accidents. I had learned how to drive in the past but it’s been years and relearning in this area has been so difficult. My mom tells me I look so nervous and unconfident that they will fail me for that. I’m not a bad driver but it’s so draining and overwhelming and I don’t looked comfortable doing it because I’m not. I know the laws and how things work but I find myself second guessing constantly. My spatial awareness is rough, I always feel like I need way more space than needed. Even though I think I can pass the test I still find driving so tiring that I don’t think I’ll ever go out of the routes I know and that I have to drive. Driving has always been the bane of my life the biggest thing that’s made me feel like a failure, to see everyone else do it without a second thought. To see 16 year olds get their licenses and yet it’s so hard for me. It was when I saw a tiktok today where an autistic woman was explaining why it’s hard for her to drive, even though she does, that it clicked that this might be why I’ve always had such a hard time with it.\n\nI’ve also had so many breakdowns lately about driving, my mom said I could drive her somewhere so I could practice and our friend offered to drive us. It was one of my last times to practice before my test. I got so upset I couldn’t stop crying and ended up not going at all. Then when I went to take my test in the morning I was told I didn’t have everything I needed and had to reschedule. I cried literally the whole day. Both those times felt so embarrassing, I hate crying and it felt so dumb to be so upset about it when I knew logically that it could be rescheduled and it would be fine but it felt like my world was ending. I’ve always been one to get really thrown or upset when plans are messed up but this was especially bad. I’m sorry this is so much but I’ve never spoken about any of this.\n\nAll this to ask does anyone else feel this difficulty with driving and what if anything has helped? And just any tips in general are appreciated.",

During these last days, I've realized that at this point in my life, I'm very much stuck. My parents clearly don't think testing is necessary and my school doesn't offer it so there's nothing I can do right now. \n\nAs I've continued to research, I've only become more and more confused. I went from wondering if I'm autistic to wondering if I have autism, adhd, a personality disorder (specifically avoidant), social anxiety, general anxiety, whether it's in my head, whether covid has made me think this way, whether it's something else I'm completely missing, recently whether I have alexithymia, rejection sensitive dysphoria, some combination of any number of the above, whether any of this actually affects my daily life, whether everyone feels this way, whether I'm just weird.\n\nAnd I just can't anymore. I spend every waking moment thinking about this whole thing despite knowing I can't find closure until I get older and I want to stop. Anyone know how to stop obsessing over this and just move on for now? I've done pretty much everything I can at this stage of my life and I know that but I can't shake these thoughts. I want to be able to just live again, please does anyone have any advice?\n\nI don't identify with any of the above labels by the way.

I am not capable of murdering someone, it's not like I see enjoyment in doing such thing anyway, but I think it's pretty clear that if I have to save the world in exchange for one life? The decision is pretty obvious.\n\nMy mother looked confused and I think horrified? She (also my sister and my dad) couldn't believe I would do such things to her or anyone in the famil. She said she would prefer letting the world die before killing someone she cares about. I asked \"why? Why can't you murder me if millions of lives depend on it?\"\n\nThe discussion ended there because I could tell she was getting angry and I think I bit sad her son would say such a thing.

        "text": "About 4 months ago I began seeing a therapist through my work benefits, because my marriage was taking a down turn. During my first therapy session, the provider asked if I wanted to be tested for anything, so I said Autism and ADHD. I first got the idea I could be autistic from a billboard saying “Sensory sensitivity is an an autistic trait” and I felt like it rung a bell with me. \n\nAt first my therapist didn’t believe I was autistic, and compared people with ASD to highly intelligent people working in Silicon Valley, like Elon Musk (clearly not knowing much about the condition). Though she also said I likely have Dependent personality disorder. After taking the quiz, she saw that I was likely on the spectrum as high functioning. \n\nIn the state that my marriage was in, the therapist recommended that I don’t tell my partner in order to protect myself. My partner and I had “separated” months prior though we were still living together raising our kid. The biggest obstacle in our relationship was that I don’t step up enough to be the “man” of the relationship. I’m seemingly unmotivated to get a better paying job because I’m comfortable with where I’m at (it’s always challenging for me to do the application processes and interviews as well). There was always a lack of proper communication in our relationship. I would call it an unmatched “love language”. I never doubted my love for here and I thought I’d always expressed it accordingly, but she always felt like I showed disinterest, and my unwillingness to be the “man” of the relationship, to go out and work hard to support the family didn’t help either. I grew up in a different type of household from her, and apparently love isn’t enough to keep a relationship steady.\n\nThe entire time my therapist told me not to tell my wife about my condition, I was dying to tell her.. it explained so much about our relationship problems! I eventually came to the conclusion that I was not communicating effectively enough with my therapist, and painting my wife out to be more of a witch than she really was. When I told my wife I was on the spectrum, she told me it made so much sense. From the first date we had, where I would stare at her and said a total of maybe 20 words, but she told me it seemed like it was coming from a genuine place. All in all, her knowing didn’t help a relationship that was badly damaged, as she is also going though some things of her own. It felt good to get it off my mind, and I feel that she now has a better understanding of my mind works. She suggested that I get an official diagnosis. \n\nOver the past few months I’ve been doing my research on ASD, and people who are high functioning. I have so many similarities with the condition, and I feel a greater understanding of myself. Meanwhile, there are times I do things and begin to question if I’m really Autistic? Some days are such a struggle for me- the social interactions, the motivation to do anything, and going out into the world with tons of visual and auditory stimulation can make simple tasks seem difficult. I mentioned to my friend how difficult grocery shopping is for me because there’s so much going on in a grocery store that I’m easily distracted and it takes me forever to shop for anything. He told me that it’s not because of Autism, and that I’m just “indecisive”?\n\nOther days I can move freely throughout the world and it feels like nothing is holding me down. On those days I question whether I even have ASD? I feel so confident and capable, but sometimes it seems the freedom is associated with the day not presenting any challenges. For example, yesterday I felt like a master of myself, while today (a gloomy stormy windy day) I felt stressed and had a meltdown. The sound of the wind and the rain beating on the house. My kid not wanting to follow instructions to get ready for the day, and talking back to me in a way I felt disrespected. Eventually leading to an emotional moment for the both of us. I had to have a serious talk and felt emotionally drained afterward. \n\nI laid on my stomach with my face into the mattress breathing heavily afterwards, it helped me prepare myself for the rest of the day…\n\n\nI am so lost some days on how to function as an adult is “supposed to”, while I feel best living my daily life at its own freedom, but I feel as if I will not make it very long on my own, co parenting in this world full of obstacles. I can have all the confidence in the world swept away from me in a mere moment. I want to get officially diagnosed, but I am afraid no provider will take me seriously if they see that I can SOMETIMES function as a neurotypical person. \n\nI have pursued several jobs of my personal interests and have yet to find one that doesn’t burnt me out because of the demands they present physically or mentally. I’ve settled for a job with little social interaction that pays barely above minimum wage on my state, providing excellent benefits, but I’m only able to make a living off of it because of luck and the support from my crumbling marriage. There are times I am just thankful to be where I’m at because mentally I feel like I could so easily end up being someone homeless if I didn’t have the support around me. \n\nI have no one but my wife (whom our marriage is crumbled), my son, and her family as mine are all deceased. It’s a tough ass world out there some days. Especially on days where I feel the real life pressures. Many days I buckle under that pressure, and I don’t know what I would do without my supportive cast. I was living like a hermit before I met this woman.\n\nI ask myself: Do I have ASD, or am I making excuses and way more capable than I think?",

        "text": "Has anyone noticed an increase in anxiety upon diagnosis and unmasking?\n\nA bit of background, I've been on sertraline for about 10 years for anxiety. I realised late last year I am autistic (have my assessment next week). And since realising and I began to unmask, my anxiety seems to have increased and I feel like the sertraline isn't working as well any more .\n\nI reduced in sertraline and am considering coming off it on to an snri, but maybe I just need to increase it? I'm waiting on referral to mental health team as I feel I need more concise care than that of my GP (I'm very sensitive to meds and changes).\n\nBut I'm just wondering if anyone has felt similar regarding increase in anxiety?\n\nThanks for reading 💜",

        "text": "Autism runs in my family. My brother is nonverbal and I have near relatives who are higher functioning. The more time I’ve had to reflect on growing up and being an adult, the more I realize how little I understand the world around me no matter how hard I try. I’ve always been shy and introverted and 99% of my social interactions have felt awkward or embarrassing. I was the “prodigy kid” growing up, I have perfect pitch and was top of my class and graduated college early, there was always something for my parents to brag about. Despite my success my social life has been lacking and I’ve felt alone in my thoughts and feelings for the longest time. Relationships can be difficult to navigate because I’m asexual and intimacy for me both physical and emotional can be challenging. I have a lot of tendencies that I share with my brother- we pace around the room when our minds are racing, we get fixated on something particular for a while, we have sensitivities like noise. I also think I’m just a more sensitive person in general emotionally and it’s hard for me to take things lightheartedly. I feel like a lot of these things are starting to add up in my head and getting a formal diagnosis would give me a huge relief",

Even though it didn’t bother me as a child, it’s something I’m now realizing.\n\nI feel like I wasn’t raised in an environment where I was really expected to have friends, and because I didn’t understand what close friendship was growing up, that I didn’t know to feel bad about it.\n\nIt’s just weird to me how unbothered I was by my lack for friends and normal social interactions. I think once I got to late high school though, that changed and I felt rejected. As I got to that age, I think I started to notice some peoples negative reactions to things I did and said, and would try to tone it down (especially by acting more humble about my musical abilities). But I’m general, I didn’t know what I was doing wrong or how to fix it.\n\nI feel like a lot of what I hear about autistic masking is people being super systematic, organized and observant with social interactions, and creating complex rules and system to act “normal”. But for me I never felt like I had the ability to be so detail-oriented about it, and usually didn’t notice there was an issue with how I was acting until years later.\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading my very long rant. If you have a similar or different experience, I’d love to hear it! This all makes me feel weirdly sad for some reason LOL.",

Just blank. \n\nIs this what that is?! Lmao.\n\nGreat, another thing to worry about.\n\n2. Does everyone who is autistic consciously develop a social script to go by when conversing with others?\n\nI haven’t meticulously done this… I guess because I only recently discovered I’m probably autistic.\n\nI have set phrases I remember, like “how are you, what have you been up to, how’s X going”, based off of context and the person.\n\nWhen I have an upcoming encounter than has been planned, I do have to give myself enough time in advance to prepare, and I always freak out about what to say beforehand. I’ll rack my brains trying to figure out what to ask to not come across as boring or uninterested (when tbh, I really am most of the time).\n\n3. Can anybody give me any advice on how to make a script, or link any resources, or maybe even share their own script with me? I have absolutely nothing to go off, and this may be why my social interactions can be quite awkward.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Im a 46 year old Hairdresser in the UK, I experienced a burnout in April 2021 due to stress, anxiety, and personal problems including the end of an abusive relationship. I was signed off work for three months. During my absence, my boss harassed me constantly, asking me what colour formulas /ratios I use to use in certain clients that were my regulars for many years or when I would return to work, and making me believe that my colleagues could not take their time off to go on holidays because of my absence. I eventually received a letter from my employer asking for permission to search my medical records and complete a questionnaire to determine whether my employment should be terminated. I felt intimidated and experienced panic attacks, fearing that I would lose my job. I explained my circumstances to my employer, including that I had brought many customers to the salon since starting work there in July 2019 and that I always carried out my work to perfection. However, I felt that I needed more support and understanding during this difficult time and I was just getting pressure and unwelcome text messages instead.\n\nI returned to work before my sick leave ended as I felt guilty that some of my colleagues were on holiday. However, I never disclosed that I was diagnosed with autism back in my country 30 years ago as I felt that it would not benefit me and could lead to negative repercussions. I eventually disclosed my autism to my employer to explain why I never engaged in social activities on work nights out, why I was sometimes absent from the floor, and why I shut myself in the bathroom for a few minutes. I also explained that I had mood swings and more frequent panic attacks in the salon, which my colleagues did not understand. However, my boss's attitude towards me lately was that I was being a bit crazy and that it was good to be crazy. This led to everyone avoiding me, and I felt isolated.\n\nThroughout the year, I felt constantly under pressure and mentally drained. I had trouble sleeping at night due to the intense stress I was experiencing. Even after explaining how my work could be improved, my appointment book constantly changed, and I sometimes did not have enough time to complete appointments. Every day, I felt like I was carrying the weight of the world on my shoulders.\n\nIn June, I had a dental emergency and needed to make an urgent appointment. I offered to return to work as soon as the appointment ended, and all they needed to do was call the client and explain the situation. However, my boss called me and accused me of faking all of my diseases, saying that there would be repercussions for my absence. I raised a grievance and asked for reasonable adjustments, but they were not upheld due to company policies. My grievance and appeal were later found unsubstantiated by an HR company brought forward by my boss.\n\nThis situation has left me feeling humiliated and unable to face my boss or leave my flat to see people. I feel that my boss is taking pleasure in the sarcastic messages she has sent me, which have had a substantial adverse effect on my condition. I have been signed off work since and have sought the help of Legal Services Agency in the UK who have advised me in the early conciliation talks with ACAS and my employer before I take a claim to tribunal over discrimination. However, I do not believe that this company can represent me in the tribunal as they are a charity and cannot charge me for their services. I’ve ended being dismissed last October and since then my life turned upside down, I can’t think of going to job interviews without experiencing extreme anxiety and once it led to me to be feeling lost in space and time and I couldn’t even speak English (which is not my native language btw) This situation has caused me severe anxiety and has affected my ability to communicate and to carry on with my day to day tasks and hopefully justice will be made, but I just don’t really have anyone to speak with as during this time I’ve also managed to people to stay away from me because they were never friends and I find it hard to be left alone at this age.\nPlease always fight for your rights and never ever let anyone do this you , I have reached out this conclusion to late for me unfortunately but sharing this would hopefully make more people aware",

I saw so many doctors and was diagnosed with ADHD by the time I got to second grade. However, my mom recently told me that one of the specialists she took me to said that there was a \"very high probability\" that I had asperger's syndrome (that's what she called it, this was like 20 years ago). I guess my mom didn't realize that asperger's is autism because she told me it had to do with being sensitive to sound. For some reason she didn't have me tested for autism and just kept me on the ADHD meds. \n\nI'm an adult now, and knowing all this really makes me think I should get assessed by a doctor. Maybe I can improve my quality of life with counciling. At the same time I don't know if it's worth the trouble.

I’m researching right now to see if I should seek diagnosis so I’m looking for all the insight and advice I can get. \n\nAlso a a side note my brother is also looking into it possibly being autistic so he will be mentioned in all of the videos and photos. \n\nFirst video- A whole class recital preforming for the classes parents and then graduating a grade (probably 1st, 2nd or 3rd). During the recital I could not stay still like the rest of the kids (nor did my brother). I swayed side to side, even doing raptor hands while doing so. I stomped my foot several times and stood on the sides of my feet too. I think I even jumped once or twice. At one point I took both my hands and made a triangleish shape and looked through it and kinda hunched over and swayed side to side. I had completely forgotten I used to do that but the video helped me remember that I used to do that thing with my hands all the time. I’m not even sure why. My brother had shut down during the recital and just stopped singing and started hugging himself really hard and trying to hide behind me. He also swayed side to side a lot. \n\nThen the recital was over and we hd to wait in line for graduation. Me and my brother both swayed side to side, spun around, stomped our foot, kept dropping our hats, stood on the sides of our feet and jumped up and down while waiting. None of the other kids moved much at all. When it the kid in front of me went to receive their certificate, as soon as they grabbed it I ran (literally ran) over and hugged my teacher before she even turned to look at me. That was the end of that video.\n\n2nd video- Class surprise present game of some kind (1st grade, maybe 2nd). The whole class was standing in a circle passing around a bag with gifts in it. Me and my brother kept jumping up and down several times (no other kid jumped even once). We kept getting distracted and swaying side to side. We both kept trying to reach for the bag even when it wasn’t our turn (like another kid was picking a present out of it). No other kids were really moving much at all other then the game required.\n\n3rd video- Us opening birthday presents. My brother ran in the room, saw the presents and then ran out flapping his hands and jumping to get me. I came running in and started jumping when I saw the presents. We then continued to open our presents.\n\n4th video- Us at a toy store for our birthday (maybe 5, not sure). The whole time I was holding one of my wrists up in front of me with my other hand. Both of us did a lot of the stuff we did in the other videos.\n\nPhotos- Several photos of us lining up toys (we did this our entire childhood, one of favorite ways to play). Some photos of us doing raptor hands. Photos of us taking toys everywhere with us (except school cause we would get in trouble for that but we did sneak them in our bags). Which we did for an unnaturally long time (and still do when I’m feeling anxious). \n\nAnyways, are these all signs? Or am I reading too much into it?",

I've also considered social anxiety and ADHD but I don't think they quite fit. If you could have a read and lmk what you think I'd be grateful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReasons I think I might be autistic:\n\nI've wondered about being autistic for a few years now, but I was always worried about making stuff up for attention. Recently retook some autism tests so I'm wondering again. Aspie quiz: 70 NT, 140 ND. AQ: 37. CAT-Q - 139, 41/49/49. Although that last one might be because I'm trans and not out at school so I camouflage a lot anyway. \n\nThings that I do that might be stimming: hugging myself and squeezing or pinching, cracking my knuckles (there's a thing I do with both hands to get all my knuckles at the same time), fiddling with clicky pens, drawing on myself, swaying, making noises, repeating something that was said.  \n\nI rehearse conversations out loud or in my head. I plan out my day - I'll be sitting in class and thinking that at lunch time I need to go to the locker room and hand in a form and go to the canteen before holing up in the library, and I'll plan out what order I'm going to do those things in to be most efficient. When I have a plan and it gets disrupted I get upset, and don't know what to do with myself. If I'm doing something I want to keep doing that thing, and if you ask me to do something else I'll be upset. But after I've been interrupted, it's hard to get back into doing something. \n\nI'm not a very social person. I have friends at school, but I have always preferred to sit by myself. Spending any long amount of time with most people leaves me feeling exhausted, and I need to focus to figure out how I should be behaving and what I should be saying. I think I mask a lot at school, and when I get home I'm really irritable because I'm so tired. A friend once told me I was fun on school camp and like a completely different person, and I think that's probably because I stopped masking after a while. \n\nI struggle with some social cues. When I was younger, I used to speak loudly at inappropriate times. Kept getting told off for it, and I don't do it anymore. I hate phone conversations because I can't see the other person and I can't figure what I should be saying when. I struggle to understand when people are teasing me that it's a joke. I don't understand play scripts because the dialogue seems inane without descriptions of how the characters are speaking. Teacher once asked me to read out a line how I think it should be said in class and I froze up because I have no idea how to do a voice without something to copy. I do like copying sounds though, and I also make a bunch of sounds in safe situations - singing really high, cat- and bird-like sounds, etc. When I was a little kid I talked a lot in sounds after I learnt to speak, and my mum joked that I was talking in Russian or Portuguese or Korean. \n\nIf I'm alone, I can entertain myself for hours without technology or a book or anything, just by wandering in circles, spinning around, watching shiny things move, sitting in a tree, etc. I also like to jump on/climb on things. \n\nI've always been very sensitive to loud noises - they make me stressed especially if I'm trying to focus. I've needed earplugs to get through events, and I've left a school event after a few minutes because the music was too loud. I hate online tests because everyone is typing around me and I feel trapped by the sound. I also don't like to eat garlic, lollies, etc not because I don't like the taste but because it leaves a funny feeling in my mouth that I can't get rid of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReasons I'm worried I'm not actually autistic: \n\nI don't struggle with eye contact. Sure, it's hard when I'm giving a speech or doing an interview or something, but neurotypical people struggle with eye contact in those situations too. In normal conversation, I don't often make eye contact, but when I do it's not hard or strange.\n\nI like people. People are cool! I like to watch them and write down things they say, and it's nice when they're friendly to me. \n\nMy play was imaginative play, and I was roleplaying Warrior cats with my friends until I was eight or nine. I don't mind non-fiction books but I generally prefer fiction. \n\nI don't think I've ever had a special interest. I can hyper-fixate on something for a few hours, but I've never been interested in one thing for more than two-ish weeks, and I don't think I've ever been interested in something enough that it would count as a special interest.\n\nI also don't have any problems with clothes tags. The vast majority of them don't bother me at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading back that's a pretty long post, oops. If you read it all, leave a nice comment or something? Thanks :p",

        "text": "I'm not just talking about the obvious stuff like working for a tobacco company. It gets as silly as me not wanting to be a cashier at a place like a grocery store, because then I'd have to make snap visual judgements about who to card and who not to and as to whether I believe the documentation they present to me (both my mom and I have had multiple people falsely accuse us of having fake IDs when buying alcohol and make whole a scene out of it). I have even decided I don't want to do stuff like be a teacher, doctor, veterinarian, or therapist. This might seem counterintuitive. These professions are supposed to be in the business of helping people, so it seems like I'd be more drawn to them, right? Far from it.\n\nA pattern I have noticed in all of the helping professions like this is that you pretty much inevitably have to juggle lots of power dynamics in a socially acceptable manner, which means that at some point, you are pressured immensely, sometimes by the law, to do things that clearly aren't what's best for your students/clients/patients.\n\nHere's one example out of many possible similar situations across fields like this. Say you are a pediatrician and you are confronted with an anti-vaxx parent who doesn't want their child vaccinated at all. That parent's 15-year-old, who has never had a vaccine in their life, shows up at your practice wanting to get vaccinated. Legally and socially, you are expected to side with the parent, regardless of their stance and how it affects the child's wellbeing. \n\nIf you go ahead and allow the 15-year-old to consent to their own vaccinations, even though it would be the best thing for them and the odds of them reacting adversely are nothing compared to what happens if they catch what they're being vaccinated against without any immunity, you face steep legal penalties and probably wouldn't be supported by your colleagues either because of the social norm that parents always have the last say when someone has not existed an arbitrarily determined number of years, even if it were their personal opinion that vaccines are a good idea for the vast majority of people. You are also expected to protect the liability of whatever place you are practicing out of.\n\nIf situations like that regularly came with the territory of a full-time occupation, I would either lose my license/certification to practice that thing very quickly or my mental health would take a massive nose dive. I already struggle with this in my part-time job as a math enrichment teacher. Working just three hours a week, I've had to deal with helicopter parents complaining to my boss about the autonomy I give their children when they take a class with me and being unpopular with coworkers for being the only one to fight for kids getting disability accommodations and/or academic acceleration when the situation warrants it.\n\nI haven't encountered anybody else who thinks about this and people seem to think it's a bit over-the-top. It seems like most people don't feel the all-consuming emotional turmoil that I do when it comes to playing their part in maintaining the social order of the above career choices.",

        "text": "Up until I was around 8 years old, I was pretty much nonverbal. The only person I would talk to was my grandmother. I wouldn’t even speak to my dad or other family members and especially strangers. When I started preschool, I wouldn’t talk to other children or teachers. I didn’t participate in learning exercises and remember always flipping my worksheets over to draw spiders. I also have very vivid memories from 3 years old+ which my fiancé thinks is odd; she says most people can’t remember anything younger than around 6 years old. I was diagnosed with autism at 6 years old, primarily because of being nonverbal and not interacting with the world around me. Around 8 years old, my dad got very impatient with the fact I wouldn’t say a word and told me that if I couldn’t ask for things, I couldn’t have them. This was in reference to me going to the fridge to get something to drink. I remember it being distressful and crying. After a few hours, I finally went up to him and asked for a drink. He was shocked, but very happy. This started becoming a thing that my dad kept doing with me. We’d go out to eat and I’d point at something on the menu to the waitress and he would tell me I can’t have anything unless I asked the waitress myself with words. I didn’t say a word; he’d order and then after they brought out food, he’d give up and order something for me. After several times of trying this, I eventually said “I want” to the waitress and pointed at something on the menu and this was acceptable. My dad didn’t believe in autism or really any types of mental health things and thought I was just shy.  \nI struggled in school my whole life and only had 1 friend growing up. We became friends at 7 years old and remained friends for 13 years. I think my friend rubbed off on me and I began “masking” because I’d mimic things she would do and eventually became comfortable talking. After masking for so long, I feel like no one can tell I have autism and I convinced myself that I’m completely neurotypical and never told anyone I have autism. After being diagnosed at 6 years old, nothing else was ever done. My mom would tell someone I have autism in my youth and I would deny it because I wanted to be like everyone else and I thought that term was another word for “stupid” (Sorry, just saying how I felt). I was never educated on what autism means, symptoms, or anything.  \nI decided to go to college a few years ago and was nervous because I’ve always struggled with academics and learning in large groups of people. I had an IEP when I was in school so I learned in a small class of 5 people usually. When I got to college, I did remarkably well; I think because I love science and obsessed with learning every single thing about it; I was going into healthcare, so most classes involved science. I considered getting an IEP because we were taking an online test and I couldn’t focus because of other students typing. I ended up being allowed to wear ear plugs, so I was fine. I graduated with a 3.7 GPA. Now I work in the operating room and I feel like I fit in well for the first time in my life. You’d be surprised how many surgeons have autism.  \nI feel like the way autism impacts me has changed since I have gotten older. The only real issues I have are that I don’t like being touched (you know those people who touch while communicating), I don’t like noises, I struggle to express how I feel with words and facial expressions, and it’s hard for me to read other people; like I can’t tell if someone is joking and can be too literal.",

I’m hesitant to seek out a new one because of my past experiences. \n\nI don’t really understand therapy. In the past I have come in asking for help with low self esteem and anxiety. The therapist always centers their treatment around essentially telling your self the opposite of your intrusive thoughts. You think you are ugly? Go tell your reflection it’s beautiful! Anxious about work? Think about the good things you like about work! You notice people don’t like you? Love yourself! This seems extremely condescending to me. Like I’ve been living like this for 35 years. Don’t you think I’ve tried those things? If it was as simple as “love yourself!” Don’t you think I would be just fine? I just can’t do it. It doesn’t help. \n\nSecond “love yourself!” Pisses me off too. The only feedback I get from the world is that I am hated on sight by everyone. Even if I like me, who cares? Me thinking I’m great doesn’t change the fact I have no friends and never will. It doesn’t change the fact that I’m completely useless to most people. I want to have genuine friendships but I can’t. So how does “loving yourself” help anyone?\n\nCan someone look at how I interpreted these interactions and tell me if I’m just not seeing the point? Or if I’m just missing something overall? I find this whole thing so frustrating.",

        "text": "I am wondering about myself. I have many suspicions of being autistic, and probably since I was about 8 I personally remember experiencing a transition in my personality and behavior.\n\nI talked to my biological mother and she told me when I was younger (~5yo) that I talked to everyone and that I was super smart and didn’t seem to have any noticeable behaviors that struck concern. On the other hand, they my brother checked out because he didn’t talk until he was two years old and he always was rocking back and forth. The doctor’s dismissed him and said he was fine.\n\nIn my early child hood I was put into foster care, went in at 7yo and returned to my parents at 8yo, and soon after that my parents divorced (in a rough way), and I was eventually put with my dad, but he pit me and my brothers with baby sitters, so we were constantly bounced around. At this time, I became very reclusive and “mean” as people would describe me, when in reality I was traumatized by the way my parents’ fought and I feel like constantly being moved around called my development to take a turn.\n\nWhen I turned 13yo me, my siblings, and my dad all moved into my now stepmother’s house, and I just went to highschool like usual. My parents never really spent much quality time with me at all, I always hid in my room away from everyone and really just didn’t talk most of the time.\n\nThere are some more really crazy and traumatizing things that happened during this time, but when I turned 17 I moved in with my boyfriend who I am still with and I was finally able to be myself, and the past 3 years (Im almost 20yo now), I have noticed a lot of telltale signs/traits of me being autistic.\n\nEveryone I talk to tells me no, because as a kid I was talkative, but I feel like I was on autopilot this entire time and I always masked how I felt, I have always just “acted” normal.\n\nI can’t even understand what people are talking about half the time. I didn’t realize how much I got made fun of in school until my (only two) friends pointed it out to me, and now as an adult as I take care of myself I just notice things that apparently are autistic traits like eating the same thing every single day, changing clothes multiple times a day because I am not comfortable, flicking my wrists and ankles, and seemingly feeling like the world is ending if my little schedule gets interrupted. I can’t even sympathize with my significant other, regardless of how much I love them. I try to share their interests but I cant and they think I don’t love them or care, but its not that, I just can’t understand their excitement, because its not my own.\n\nI feel like I am in denial and I don’t know what to believe. I think I am autistic because all these traits I have as an adult are obvious, but people tell me its not possible because I was a talkative child. Is it possible to have my development deterred because of traumatic experiences?",

I am special, as are each of you in our own way.. someone going to rip me for that I’m sure. NT people hate me saying that.\nSo that’s my background in a few lines. \n\nI’m a parent to two boys and the oldest 3 I am kinda coping with but together i meltdown quickly, I can’t really handle everything going on around me, there’s too much to watch, there’s so much to hear and before I know I literally am hold my ears wanting to leave the room or and go to hide or slip an ear bud in. I love my boys more than myself, truly, I am told a lot that I am a good father by people .. everyone except my mother in law, but we all have those. \nI am joking bit but in truth I am really struggling with solo parenting. Even if I avoid the meltdown myself I am a nervous wreck after a day alone, I spoke to my partner but it fell on death ears… can’t blame her, she carry’s a lot for me because shops for example are overwhelming so she does all of the food shopping, which I reciprocate in my own way by doing house work at home .. and I pay for the shopping lol. \nCan anyone relate to the feeling of struggling to cope more than others seemingly do ? And if so does it get easier as they get older, once you have to worry less about safety ? Mine are 18 months and 3 years old. \nAs I say I am autistic, I have no friends and work alone (intentionally) so I don’t have anyone to ask really. I am new to Reddit so excuse the long text, also dyslexic.. my apologies for adding extra work for you cracking the code.

But I had to run errands yesterday and I'm fucking beat today. It's not that it was \"hard\" to mask, I just think I didn't realize how much cognitive overload I go through trying to remember to do this, that, the other, and pay attention to what people are saying. Not to mention following instructions is a lot less clear when it's not directly communicated where I can go back and see this is exactly what they said. \n\nAnd masking didn't really feel \"fake\" either? Because it wasn't like I was putting on this show, more like just different parts of my personality were coming out. But if \"putting on a show\" means that I was socializing when I didn't want to, adding conversational spice to be polite and engaging, then maybe. I remember feeling like this every once and a while when I was high masking and used to constantly going, and I'd only ever burn out or feel worn out every once and a while. Even then I felt good because I was \"productive\". Now? I'm just tired. \n\nWould I love IRL friends and relationships? Absolutely. And I'll jump on the chance the second it comes around. But all that socializing based on performance isn't the way to get it, at least not very often. If it were, I wouldn't be as isolated as I am now, and all I did in college would have meant something. With online conversations, you can get to the point, you can say exactly what you mean and what you want, you can just put yourself out there and whoever wants to talk to you will talk to you, you can even reach out to people and not face the bitter sting of rejection or being ignored nearly as often, and it's way harder to misunderstand. \n\nI'm told all the time I need to \"put myself out there\" and go to places I hate that are loud, obnoxious, and boozy. Considering we're gleefully in a death of mass disabling and death for the sake of \"normal\" right now, no thanks. So surely there are other people like me I can meet if I just....I don't know....hold on? Keep doing what I'm doing?",

        "text": "I'm still trying to figure out who I am and to be honest, it's more hard than I could have guessed.\n\nFor starters, I'm a teenager (16), second, I suspect I have alexithymia so I don't know what I'm feeling 99% of the time and for last, I'm an obsessive person and being autistic is the only thing I can think of 24/7. It's been hell, for multiple reasons, but it also includes over analyzing every movement I do to check if \"that's autistic or an allistic thing\"\n\nMy deep research initiated about... 4 months ago I think, but I've been suspecting for much longer. The thing is, sometimes I feel VERY confident that I'm autistic and in the next day I'm suffering and having a burnout of sorts for weeks accusing myself for lying and seeking attention. \n\nLike, today, I wanted to buy a Fanta (a beverage) for my partner, and without thinking, I just walked and did everything without problems. Everything went great. I should feel great because social interactions are a thing I struggle a lot and need preview preparation and a script to function, but now I can't stop repeating the scene in my head and using it argument to say I'm just acting autistic when I'm not.\n\nI feel shamed, I hate myself so much, I don't know what to do, I really don't want to look like I'm acting or \"You want to fulfill a diagnosis with a personality that it's not actually you\", like my parents tell me. I just feel so lost, I want to have an answer and end this torture as fast as possible.",

        "text": "Hi. This is going to be a long read, so I understand if no one wants to read it. I just need to talk about everything.\n\nI am not diagnosed. I know that here, self diagnosis is accepted, but I still feel awful feeling this way without a proper diagnosis. I have heard it is very difficult to be diagnosed due to issues with actually speaking to a professional, and how sometimes autism gets dismissed for something else, or just ignored. I have an autistic friend who swears that I am, and she has known me since I was a young teen, now almost 20yo. She got me to take the assessments she took, and she is formally diagnosed, and I scored above the maximum requirement for each assessment. Its just the fact Ive been dismissed as being “stubborn” or “misbehaved” my whole life, like I have been gaslit this whole time, that I don’t know what to do or what to think. I’ve never been a bad kid, I was a straight A student, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t struggle to keep up my entire life, especially socially.\n\nI have severe social anxiety, separation anxiety, and sensory issues. I cannot talk on the phone, I cannot keep a job, I cannot order for myself at restaurants, I can’t even make an appointment for myself if I needed to. If I had to call 911 if I was in a dangerous situation, I don’t know if I could. I can’t even handle speaking in person to my own family, it is so hard for me. I get sweaty and nervous just sending a simple text to anyone. I don’t go anywhere alone. I barely even go to the bathroom by myself. I never shower by myself, I don’t sleep by myself, I won’t eat unless someone else is eating, etc. I try to sleep while my boyfriend is at work so that I am not trapped in my own mind. \n\nSensory issues are another major issue I have. I change clothes multiple times a day, especially socks. I will not touch my floor without socks. I can’t stand wearing my hair certain ways or even tucking it behind my ear frustrates me. I can’t stand loud noises. I cover my ears around trains or speakers. I keep vibrations and sound haptics disabled on my phone because they scare me. I don’t like flashing lights and certain colors make my head hurt. I constantly twist and pop my ankles/wrists so much that it hurts, but I can’t help it. I don’t like touching people and I don’t like them touching me, I always refuse hugs and handshakes, and people just think I am mean, but I just can’t do it. I only wear the same old clothing as I always do because anything new or uncomfortable frustrates me. I can’t handle heat. Being slightly sweaty makes me want to just sit in the shower in cry.\n\nCurrently, I want a diagnosis. The problem with this, is that I can’t do it myself, and I am too afraid to even tell my parents how I feel about this. They are close minded, and I know if I told them how I thought I was autistic, that I would be met with blank stares and would be gaslit like I always have been. I want their help, but I can’t even talk to them. They won’t accept it. They would tell me I am too smart for what I am saying to be true.. but, thats not how it works at all. They don’t even believe that I have allergies when I told them.\n\nI am happy to have my current S/O, they help me get through a lot of these things and they are acceptant of my self diagnosis, and they encourage me to just be myself. But am I the only one who desires a real diagnosis? I know something is wrong. I can’t even take care of myself. I could quite literally not be independent and fend for myself it I needed to.\n\nThe last thing I am confused about is why? Why didn’t my parents think anything was abnormal? I walk on my tip toes. I have clear issues with how materials felt. I didn’t have friends. I clearly have an eating disorder, and I even verbally told them this. Why did they dismiss all of it? And could this be why I am so doubtful of myself? \n\nI don’t know. Thanks to anyone who actually read all of this. There is so much more I actually want to say. I don’t know what to do at this point in my life. The way I live my day to day life is a struggle and it hinders me from being a person, or at least that is how I feel.",

        "text": "Because I'm an adult woman I've had a really hard time finding information on Autism that is more geared towards my gender and age. It seems like everything I initially found was based on young boys so I really questioned myself. But, the more research I've done and the more \"looking inward\" I've committed to, the more I'm realizing that I'm Autistic. I still haven't decided if I want to confide in my loved ones about my suspicions because I don't think I can handle them trying to invalidate me while I'm still figuring it out. I'm also scared to pursue a formal diagnosis because women are brushed off so often. So for now I'm posting on Reddit. Hopefully, something here helps somebody else. If you guys think I'm really missing the mark, let me know. (Author's Note: I tried finding the most reliable possible articles. Feel free to dig deeper if I have a source on here that is meh. Doing my best.)\n\nHere are some things that got me thinking. This is not a complete list but these are what I think of when I think of why I'm pretty sure I'm Autistic: \n\n1. **Sensory Processing Issues-** The sensory stimulation that bothers me the most is *tactile stimulation*, something that I've struggled with since I was a child. I can't go into the sand with shoes on because if any sand gets in my shoes and I can't get it out I have to throw them away. Sand on my bare feet is something that caused me immense physical discomfort as a child and as an adult I can tolerate it but I prefer to avoid it. Unexpected touch can overwhelm me very quickly and even make me upset, and other odd tactile sensations are usually off the table. For example, carving pumpkins is hell. The goopy stuff inside is an absolute no-go. Beyond tactile stimulation, I'm also very *sensitive to sound* and when I'm in loud social settings I've begun to wear Loop earplugs. I'll also wear the earplugs when I'm emotionally overwhelmed because having to hear less calms me down. I don't wear them all the time but I've certainly started wearing them more. As a child, I would simply leave parties and hide in a quiet room. As an adult, I find a couch or chair on the outskirts of the room. Too much loud noise makes me feel like I'm physically shutting down. \n2. **Eye Contact Issues-** I remember as a child realizing that people liked to look each other in the eyes when they talked. This made me super uncomfortable and I would often look at someone's forehead, nose, or another part of their face and pretend I was looking at their eyes. The older I got, the more I would engage in an internal dialogue of \"Look at their eyes! Look at their eyes!\" to force myself to engage in the way that I thought I was supposed to. I think I've probably taken it too far and now I stare at people lol. \n3. **Masking, Mirroring, and Social Anxiety-** When I was around 8, I was at a painting studio with my grandmother, one of my favorite places. I was painting my little clay item and watching all of the people around me talking, laughing, and moving, and I remember thinking that they knew something I didn't know about each other. It was like they were speaking a secret language with their bodies that I was too awkward to understand. They were so comfortable interacting, something that took immense energy and focus for me. I simply didn't understand the social rules and it drove me crazy. In my teen years, I started realizing I could simply copy the traits of those around me to fit in. My laugh wasn't my own, the tone of my voice wasn't my own, and the words I used to sound more like my peers were part of a mental script for \"the right thing to say\". It wasn't all hard though. I had lots of neurodivergent friends (and even love interests) growing up. They were often other kids like me, who didn't fit in in the \"normal\" crowd. The older I got, the better I got at masking what I felt needed masking and mirroring proper behaviors. As a result, I connected with more and more \"normal\" people. But, we never quite clicked. As an adult, I finally feel comfortable checking out at the grocery store or chatting with a stranger not because it feels natural but because I've gotten so good at faking a friendly conversation that I'm confident they won't realize it's all for show. It took me a long time to realize neurotypical people don't do these things. \n4. **Info Dumping/Oversharing/Overtalking-** I'm sure it comes as no surprise that I'm a talker given how much I've written. I started talking at a much, much younger age than normal and have always had an affinity for words and writing. My mom once said (in a statement that will haunt me for the rest of my life and crippled me with anxiety as a teenager), \"She started talking when she was six months old and she hasn't shut up since.\" That's probably why I got so good at mirroring and having these scripted conversations. I'm not very good at people, but I'm good at talking. If I have an interest, you won't hear the end of it and I often realize in hindsight that maybe I was being a bit annoying going on and on about the history of wild boars in California's Central Coast. You know, typical conversation stuff. When I'm not talking about something that I find interesting I'm usually oversharing. \"Hey stranger, want to know my deepest hidden secrets? Because you're about to.\" I'm a shockingly open book. In general, I struggle to control the word count but have gotten better and better about it the older I've gotten. As a child, I was often in trouble for talking and I developed a lot of trauma and shame around being \"annoying.\" That's probably why as an adult I usually apologize when I'm done talking. I know I don't have to, but I definitely worry that people still think I'm the girl who never shut up. While Autistic folks can be nonverbal or have developmentally delayed speech, [other people (like me) talk early and a lot.](https://awnnetwork.org/actually-its-crooked-autism-and-precocious-speech/)\n5. **ADHD-** Like many girls, it wasn't until adulthood that I realized I had ADHD. It started because I took a quiz online. About a year later, I had my formal diagnosis. It explained so much- the reaction sensitive dysphoria, the executive dysfunction, the talking, the short term memory issues. It explained so much about me, in fact, that I stopped investigating. But, in the past six years since I've been diagnosed, I've realized that I've got more going on than just ADHD. ADHD doesn't account for much of my social struggles, for example. At least not to the degree I experience them. And, as it turns out, [ADHD and Autism can be comorbid conditions.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8918663/)\n6. **Trouble Making/Keeping Friends-** Let's chalk this up to masking only taking me so far. Eventually, the real me comes out and she's a bit awkward, very chatty, can suck at boundaries, and has atypical interests. All of that makes it tricky for people to form close friendships with me. At work, for example, I've gotten closest with my neurodivergent coworker and am not particularly close with my very neurotypical coworkers. This is in part because my ND coworker and I can infodump to the ends of the Earth with each other about early childhood education, shows we both like, etc. and we're both pretty comfortable sharing our personal lives with each other and crossing \"sharing info\" lines that other people might not want to cross. Another example of this is with my close friendships in general. My best friend is Autistic and half of our friendship is sending each other obscure text messages only the other one would understand and laughing hysterically. My wife is also Autistic. In fact, when I look around at my life, the only neurotypical people I've ever felt comfortable around are my closest family members and I don't even drop my guard around them because they wouldn't understand. \n7. **Aversion to Social Gatherings-** This is another tricky thing that I haven’t fully gotten the hang of. I have a really hard time pretending to enjoy social gatherings that I’m not feeling happy about and even if I’m into the idea of a social gathering, I’m usually the first one ready to quit once we get there. The exception is my small group of close friends. I still feel uncomfortable around them but I’ve put up a pretty strong shield of telling jokes and I really like hearing them laugh. My social gathering of preference is one other close friend at a time. Family gatherings are especially stressful and major family events like Christmas with extended family are fun in theory but I usually spend the entire time somewhere off to the side interacting with as few people at a time as possible and complaining to my closest loved ones that I’m having a terrible time lol. \n8. **Trouble Self-Regulating-** Self-regulation is something I really struggle with and while this is an aspect of ADHD as well I think in my case it’s both the ADHD and Autism. When something bothers me, it’s usually a “big deal”, even if the real situation isn’t as big as I feel it is. In fact, extremes kind of rule my coping skills and things often feel like emergencies that aren’t. As a parent, this means I sometimes get really overwhelmed over small things and I’ve had to learn to apologize to my daughter and start over or step away when I’m upset so I can properly handle a given situation. Living in a fully neurodiverse household, emotions can sometimes run high. \n9. **Chronic Pain-** I've had musculoskeletal pain since I was a child that I couldn't explain which went undetected on scans. As an adult, it got so bad that I was going to rheumatologists and neurologists desperately searching for an answer with no luck. We eventually landed on CFS/Fibromyalgia. Turns out, chronic pain conditions are common for Autistic folks and [research is starting to suggest a link between CFS, Fibro, and Autism.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/complementary-medicine/201106/is-autism-related-cfs-and-fibromyalgia)\n10. **GI Issues-** I first started experiencing digestive issues as a child, including severe stomach pain after eating, difficulty going to the restroom, and GERD which caused vomiting. As an adult, I still really struggle with stomach problems and having difficulty with certain foods. [Who else has lots of GI issues? Many Autistic folks!](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8608248/)\n11. **Motor Difficulties-** I didn't start to walk until I was nearly two years old and as an adult I have never met somebody as clumsy as me or who runs as slow as me. I'm often hitting objects, dropping things, I can't play sports, I have very poor balance, and I can't run. While [motor difficulties alone are common](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8480230/) for Autistic folks, [comorbidity between Dyspraxia and Autism](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/autism/other-conditions/) might also be the cause. \n12. **Heat Intolerance-** When I was searching for answers about my chronic pain, one of the things that I would mention was my near inability to handle hot weather without practically falling apart at the seams. I mean *seriously* I cannot handle anything beyond a temperate climate. Turns out, what I thought might be a symptom of some terrible autoimmune disease is also [an aspect of Autism](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/heat-intolerance-and-autism-spectrum-disorder) I wasn't aware of. \n\nThanks for reading. I’d love to hear more about your experiences with self-diagnosis and what lead you to suspect Autism.",

        "text": "I had my assessment yesterday, but I won’t get the results for another two weeks.  It was a lot shorter than I thought it would be, and we didn’t cover what I thought we would, so I don’t know if it was just really obvious that I’m autistic or if he decided quickly that I’m not.  He said he was evaluating me for autism and ADHD, but I’m worried he didn’t do enough to properly evaluate me for autism.\n\nHe put me through some psychological testing that included repeating back lists of words, drawing something from memory, pattern matching, solving riddles where he’d give me three clues and have me tell him the word they described, repeating back the details from a story, and choosing a picture that best matched the word he gave me.\n\nAfter about an hour of testing he said he thought he had everything he needed from the testing, and we went back to his office and he talked to me for another hour.  We mostly discussed the document I brought which lists my symptoms, and included a lot of information from my mom about my childhood.  She wrote about how I was super shy and withdrawn, almost never made eye contact, didn’t engage in conversation much, was extremely distressed about loud noises, and did the stereotypical hand flapping and arm waving.  I don’t think he read the entire thing while I was there, but he was reading parts of it during the pattern exercise that took me a long time.\n\nHe didn’t spend a lot of time on the childhood stuff though, instead mostly focusing on my experiences as an adult.  We talked a lot about my social difficulties, and while he didn’t label me as autistic, he was giving me advice as if I already had an autism diagnosis, so maybe that’s a good sign.  He even said to me at one point that he wasn’t sure if I disagreed with what he was telling me or if I was just thinking about it, because my face was emotionless and there was a lack of nonverbal communication from me.\n\nHe also had me take the MMPI after I got home, which I struggled with because the questions were so ambiguous and I could only answer true or false.\n\nHe called my wife right afterwards, and they talked for 20-30 minutes.  She told me later he said something about me probably being neurodivergent, but the way he said it has me wondering if he’s ruled out autism.\n\nI’m worried that his assessment wasn’t thorough enough and that he’s going to misdiagnose me.  The first hour of testing seemed like it was more for ADHD and IQ than it was for autism.  I’m not super familiar with official autism assessments like the ADOS and MIGDAS, but none of the testing he did seemed to match what I know about those assessments.  I also know it’s common for an autism evaluation to take 3-5 hours just for the testing, and mine was very short.\n\nWe have another appointment in two weeks for him to discuss the results with me.\n\n\nDoes it sound like he did a proper autism assessment, even though it was so short?\n\nHow do I know if I can be confident in his findings?",

        "text": "Hello, \n\nfor clarification in advance, (if my \"user flair\" isn't visible) I am not *yet* officially diagnosed, but waiting for my chance in a lengthy waiting list ~~since it sucks to be an adult and find things out too late~~. Please forgive me if I write oddly or slightly unclear, I've been told as such and it makes addressing things a little difficult.\n\n**Situation:**\n\nWhen you happen to be a part of a chat community of \"friends\", let's say, of approximately 10-20+ people. You might **not** be close with them and/or may **not** know the larger part of them. And, someone makes a (written) statement, it matters little what it is about, say \"I like cats.\", And you give your opinion to it, or make a statement of your own related to this same, related topic. \n\nThen another person does it after you (without interacting with what you've said or added). The next persons will then **only** respond to the original statement or that person that came after you, but skip you entirely as if it was never seen or read. \n\nHow does that make you feel? How do you respond if that *keeps happening* all the time?\n\n**. . .**\n\nPersonally, I have a lengthy history of being ignored, even in the face, and I simply don't know how to respond to it. I catch myself overthinking if I should have said anything, wondering if I phrased it correctly, even consider isolating from social interaction and maybe become a mute entirely. People will even avoid me *after* addressing me, they'll say something to me but dodge the things I'll say in return, unless they *need* it badly enough to get ahead. (Example: a service you offer)\n\nFor clarification, again, this is not a rant or an expression to feel sorry for myself, this is to reveal my thought process and my self doubt that develops accordingly. I hold no grudges against people, but situations as such make me wonder if it's targeted at me, specifically. \n\nSo, it may not *just* be a \"How do you respond?\" but also a \"Do you recognize this kind of situation as well?\" Or, maybe you have any tips on how to deal with those situations. Everything is very much appreciated! Thank you for reading.",

        "text": "So I have two therapists, a current and a former, that believe I'm a level 1 autistic but they can't diagnose me, and my formal evaluation came back that I'm so smart I can't relate to people normally, plus the impacts of childhood emotional trauma. My position after several months of reflecting on the results of that evaluation is that the evaluator was biased and flat out wrong.\n\nThe main reason is that I believe I'm only traumatized because I'm autistic, and the emotional abuse I suffered would have had more mild consequences had I been neurotypical. If I'm a neurotypical genius with some mild emotional abuse, as the evaluation suggested, I wouldn't have been on disability by my mid 30s. \n\nMy evaluator largely ignored my overall medical history. By the time of that evaluation I had over a decade of doctors mostly telling me the things I felt hurt, shouldn't actually hurt, and it must be in my head. My \"anxiety\" never improved, I was constantly overwhelmed, and my body seemed to just be falling apart from nothing but raw stress. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and somatization, but I think both of those symptomatic diagnoses are the result of so many years of unattended sensory issues, masking, etc. I think the reason I got to a point that I couldn't work was actually severe autistic burnout. \n\nIn spite of the evaluator finding I wasn't autistic, I have been trying and using autistic strategies, and they work for me. I'm finding that usually when I'm \"grumpy\", I'm actually overstimulated and need a sensory break, or burning out and in dire need of rest. I plan my weeks trying to allow the down time I know I'll need to recover. I love my noise cancelling headphones and I'll use them when my hearing sensitivity gets bad. I've realized I actually do have a strong tendency to ramble about a topic, and thanks to the fact that my son was evaluated and found to be very bright but also moderately ADHD, I realize that I have overlapping ADHD traits. I'm trying to unmask at home with my new wife, letting myself be weird and bounce my legs or do weird things with my hands, because it helps me feel better. We play like kids sometimes and it's wonderful. \n\nBut I also remember my mother's 1990's typical rants that autism and ADHD were over diagnosed and kids were kids, some just need more help to grow out of childish behaviors. And my father's disdain for my love of video games, nerdy stuff, and generally not being manly enough for his approval. I think I really was one of those kids that was smart enough and pushed enough, to mask very hard and very young. I'm still trying to figure out what behaviors I might have suppressed.\n\nMy family mostly doesn't seem to believe I'm autistic, and I just want to be comfortable somewhere saying, \"Yes, I'm a level 1 autistic and that's why I'm on disability.\" I feel judged so often, I look healthy, used to have a great job, and I'm very intelligent and capable when I'm not overwhelmed... but in the kind of burnout I'm in, I'm overwhelmed 50% or more of my life right now. I really do not think neurotypicals understand what I'm experiencing, only autism seems to pull everything together into a coherent experience for me.\n\nI've lurked here for a long time, I've read so many posts like this I almost feel cliche with this, but I guess I could use the same validation others are often seeking here. Is it OK to call myself autistic here, and hopefully the other related subreddits?",
