Im not on pc but would be cool to see the comparison from title image in the anime vs the silhouette in th manga. He could've bank rolled the lab, know the ins and outs like stussy. Stussy works for the world gob but sides with vegapunk. Duveld bank rolls mads, more specifically vegapunk, is a double agent for the world gob, opposite to stussy. If we take wano out of the equation, in whole cake we're introduced to these underworld emperors. It could just that there wasn't time to develop the characters. We now get stussy, Morgan's appears again, he's literally in a recent cover story.",

        "text": "Top tier:\n\n1- Luffy\n\nLuffy is entertaining, lovable, and he perfectly encapsulates what I love about Onepiece: adventure, friendship, courage, utter madness.... His solo adventure during the marineford saga solidified him as the best strawhat for me.\n\n2- Jinbe\n\nI think he is a well balanced character. He doesn't have the greatest highs, but he is the one character without any lows. His bond with Luffy is one of the best written in the series.\n\n3- Sanji\n\nI think he has the most depth of any strawhat. He has a very broad range of emotions. Can be serious and badass or very goofy and ridiculous. Has one of the best developed bonds with characters like Luffy, Zoro, and Pudding. His main problems is his questionable gags and low moments (punk hazard) which puts him below a character like Jinbe.\n\n4- Robin\n\nRobin has one of the best stories in Onepiece with some of the best characterization. Seeing her develop onscreen from a nihlistic suicidal woman to a woman who fights for her life was one of the best character arcs in the story. Her dream is probably the most relevant to the plot after Luffy's. We can see her actual dream progression unlike with many other strawhats and their dreams. The problem with Robin is her sidelining post Enies Lobby, not having the best developed individual bonds with the rest of the crew (in the same tier of Luffy/Zoro&amp;Luffy/Ussop), and the questionable fanservice.\n\nMid tier:\n\n5- Zoro\n\nLovable and very entertaining. Zoro has some of the best fights in the series, as well as great moments. He is a very likable honorable man. He doesn't have the most depth and Oda clearly sees him as a badass strong guy type of character, but there isn't much wrong with that in a fighting manga like Onepiece.\n\n6- Franky\n\nI liked Franky a lot in the pretimeskip. His design and his characterization in Water 7 were very appealing to me. I liked his role in Dressrosa and still like him, but he barely has much sceeentime right now. He almost feels like a side character.\n\n7- Brook\n\nOne of the best backstories in the series and one of the best character designs. Brook is very likable, but he has even less screentime than Franky. His last good moment was in WCI before he disappeared from the manga.\n\n8- Chopper\n\nI don't hate Chopper as many other people do, but you can't deny that he was downgraded post timeskip to become a mascot for the series. His screentime is mostly him looking cute. his design isn't that good and he doesn't use most of his forms anymore. That being said he still has his moments every now and then and still contributes to the crew as a doctor, and helped cure the virus in Wano. He doesn't deserve to be in the bottom tier.\n\nBottom tier:\n\n9- Nami\n\nOnce my favorite character early in the series with one of the best backstories and characterization, Nami had a huge fall from grace. Her fights if present are the worst of any crewmember: either fanservice (like Kalifa), require huge amount of suspension of belief, or boring and with bad choreography. She doesn't even fight herself anymore, Oda gave her a sentient weapon who does everything for her. Her dream progress is done offscreen (because who cares about map drawing) and her best talent is utilized offscreen (because who cares about navigation). Once praised for her intelligence, she barely utilizes it anymore for Oda prefers to give tactical feats to male characters like (Law, Sanji, and Jinbe). No strength and no intelligence, what is she good for? She is mostly an eyecandy right now. Other female characters like Robin, Vivi, Bonney, Pudding, and Hancock all receive attention and development from Oda despite the much less screentime, but not Nami. Her best development is Oda giving her assshots in the new arc instead of the traditional boobshots. Despite being one of the original 3 crew members in the story, Nami has been so overshadowed by Sanji, that most Onepiece fans would claim him as the third main character alongside Luffy and Zoro. All of that while her fans are still hoping for the long awaited development and origin story from Oda, which will likely happen in an SBS.\n\n10- Ussop\n\nThe W7 development was probably my favorite character arc in the series. He had a good fight in Thriller Park, and things were looking good for him. Then Oda turned him into Buggy. This is one of the East Blue strawhats, he should have more screentime, more development,...\n\nUssop has probably shown more courage against Chu in Arlong Park than against the beast pirates, this speaks a lot about his character. His best achievement in Wano was tricking an orphan girl, he was seriously struggling with fodders, not commanders and not Tobi roppos, fodders...\n\nHis screen time is making some funny faces, that's it. The last time he had a significant prolonged interaction with Luffy (a classic bond) was in pretimeskip. All the while his fans are still waiting for Elbaf to be his arc just like how Wano was Zoro's arc and how Egghead Island is Franky's arc",

I don't think those celestials are worth that.\n\nso as per my theory, Dragon was on Rogers ship and visited laughtale, and he knows the history, he doesnt want to wait for some joyboy to appear so taking all in his own hands.\n\nmeans dragon can be a person who knows about the last island, world history and leading a revolution against them, unlike other members of roger pirates who are living retirement life\n\none more thing\nGarp took ace in on request by Roger, becoz all this time Roger took care of his son dragon and also saved him from world govt.\n\nHope it gets accepted and all fans can read it and give reviews.",

        "text": "Top tier:\n\n1- Luffy\n\nLuffy is entertaining, lovable, and he perfectly encapsulates what I love about Onepiece: adventure, friendship, courage, utter madness.... His solo adventure during the marineford saga solidified him as the best strawhat for me.\n\n2- Jinbe\n\nI think he is a well balanced character. He doesn't have the greatest highs, but he is the one character without any lows. His bond with Luffy is one of the best written in the series.\n\n3- Sanji\n\nI think he has the most depth of any strawhat. He has a very broad range of emotions. Can be serious and badass or very goofy and ridiculous. Has one of the best developed bonds with characters like Luffy, Zoro, and Pudding. His main problems is his questionable gags and low moments (punk hazard) which puts him below a character like Jinbe.\n\n4- Robin\n\nRobin has one of the best stories in Onepiece with some of the best characterization. Seeing her develop onscreen from a nihlistic suicidal woman to a woman who fights for her life was one of the best character arcs in the story. Her dream is probably the most relevant to the plot after Luffy's. We can see her actual dream progression unlike with many other strawhats and their dreams. The problem with Robin is her sidelining post Enies Lobby, not having the best developed individual bonds with the rest of the crew (in the same tier of Luffy/Zoro&amp;Luffy/Ussop), and the questionable fanservice.\n\nMid tier:\n\n5- Zoro\n\nLovable and very entertaining. Zoro has some of the best fights in the series, as well as great moments. He is a very likable honorable man. He doesn't have the most depth and Oda clearly sees him as a badass strong guy type of character, but there isn't much wrong with that in a fighting manga like Onepiece.\n\n6- Franky\n\nI liked Franky a lot in the pretimeskip. His design and his characterization in Water 7 were very appealing to me. I liked his role in Dressrosa and still like him, but he barely has much sceeentime right now. He almost feels like a side character.\n\n7- Brook\n\nOne of the best backstories in the series and one of the best character designs. Brook is very likable, but he has even less screentime than Franky. His last good moment was in WCI before he disappeared from the manga.\n\n8- Chopper\n\nI don't hate Chopper as many other people do, but you can't deny that he was downgraded post timeskip to become a mascot for the series. His screentime is mostly him looking cute. his design isn't that good and he doesn't use most of his forms anymore. That being said he still has his moments every now and then and still contributes to the crew as a doctor, and helped cure the virus in Wano. He doesn't deserve to be in the bottom tier.\n\nBottom tier:\n\n9- Nami\n\nOnce my favorite character early in the series with one of the best backstories and characterization, Nami had a huge fall from grace. Her fights if present are the worst of any crewmember: either fanservice (like Kalifa), require huge amount of suspension of belief, or boring and with bad choreography. She doesn't even fight herself anymore, Oda gave her a sentient weapon who does everything for her. Her dream progress is done offscreen (because who cares about map drawing) and her best talent is utilized offscreen (because who cares about navigation). Once praised for her intelligence, she barely utilizes it anymore for Oda prefers to give tactical feats to male characters like (Law, Sanji, and Jinbe). No strength and no intelligence, what is she good for? She is mostly an eyecandy right now. Other female characters like Robin, Vivi, Bonney, Pudding, and Hancock all receive attention and development from Oda despite the much less screentime, but not Nami. Her best development is Oda giving her assshots in the new arc instead of the traditional boobshots. Despite being one of the original 3 crew members in the story, Nami has been so overshadowed by Sanji, that most Onepiece fans would claim him as the third main character alongside Luffy and Zoro. All of that while her fans are still hoping for the long awaited development and origin story from Oda, which will likely happen in an SBS.\n\n10- Ussop\n\nThe W7 development was probably my favorite character arc in the series. He had a good fight in Thriller Park, and things were looking good for him. Then Oda turned him into Buggy. This is one of the East Blue strawhats, he should have more screentime, more development,...\n\nUssop has probably shown more courage against Chu in Arlong Park than against the beast pirates, this speaks a lot about his character. His best achievement in Wano was tricking an orphan girl, he was seriously struggling with fodders, not commanders and not Tobi roppos, fodders...\n\nHis screen time is making some funny faces, that's it. The last time he had a significant prolonged interaction with Luffy (a classic bond) was in pretimeskip. All the while his fans are still waiting for Elbaf to be his arc just like how Wano was Zoro's arc and how Egghead Island is Franky's arc",

The straw hats already have 3 of them, but they are yet to find the fourth one. There is a way to find laugh tale with just three road poneglyph. All you have to do is draw a triangle with the three coordinates and laugh tale will be somewhere on the edges of this triangles. So, you just travel the triangle until you come across laugh tale and it doesn't matter what the 4th coordinate is. I don't think luffy will do this as it's a shortcut but some other pirates who manages to get three road poneglyphs and decipher it, may use this shortcut.](https://preview.redd.it/qeg054ut6ana1.png?width=816&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5ea9a15cf3861e570f0f72381cd1d8622a61f147)",

        "text": "Just watched One Piece Red an I have some confusions \n\n1:- When Shanks offered Uta to take the Medicine and sleep, wouldn't that woken up everybody anyway as it was stayed when the user goes to sleep the affect of their power goes away too which caused Uta to take those mushrooms to stay awake\n\n2:- Uta's death doesn't make any sense. Cause all she had to do was go to sleep and the devil fruits powers would have stopped as she was eating those mushrooms specifically just to prevent that. She should have survived logically(or probably she is not dead cause in oda's story characters are not dead untill you see them dead). It felt lousy just like how Kuina died from falling from stairs when she was strong enough to defeat all the elders in her dojo(Unless those stairs were coated with armament or conqurers haki).\n\n3:- Didn't the moment when they defeated the Demon King Simultaneously should have ended the illusion cause it was stated in the ancient drawings(and in one piece world everything from the past is always accurate). It just felt like a plot device to make Uta forcefully sing again and die in the end\n\n4:- How the freak Observation Haki allows you to see what happens through another's eyes. That's just doesn't make any sense\n\n5:- What was wrong with gear 5 like it looked like it was added last minute. So is this taking place after wano or is it taking place before wano(cause big mom)\n\n6:-Uta's devil fruit ability was supposed to pull everyone into a dream world as explained in the beginning but how come she woke everyone up with her song instead at the end(no disrespect for the scene just asking)\n\n7:- This is probably the biggest one \nHow did Shanks defeat that demon king Tot Musica in Elegia in the Past when you need to defeat it both in the dream world and real world simultaneously to defeat it completely\n\nThis movie was good but felt like a lot of unnecessary elements were put together that doesn't make any sense as plot devices to move it forward\n\nIt feels like this movie was supposed to go in a different direction with an entirely different story but they changed it last minute so it could fit in with the continuing story of the Manga\n\nSince she is declared to be a canon character of one piece I hope Oda gives her a better story in the original manga. If anyone from the one piece creators, editors or staff or anyone related is here please tell Oda sensei to make a good story for Uta in the original story and give justice to the character",

        "text": "As the title suggests, I’d like to discuss the similarities of certain arcs pre-time skip and post-time skip. I’ve noticed multiple parallels between some of them.\n\nWhiskey Peak vs. Punk Hazard. Both introduce a “big bad” that is taken on many chapters later, see the addition of temporary crew members, and set the course for the next few islands. Both see the escorting of a deposed ruler.\n\nDrum Island vs. Dressrosa. Both see the overthrowing of an evil ruler, and the straw hats getting new allies. They both act as a pit stop between inciting incidents and the big country overthrowals. \n\nAlabasta vs. Wano. Overthrowing evil rulers, big obstacles for much of the crew to overcome, important poneglyphs, you get the gist.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the future? Well, I’m predicting this next arc to act as a mix of Skypeia and Water 7/Enies Lobby, with big WG involvement, new powers being explored (dials/mantra vs Pacifistas), massive lore reveals, and ways for much of the crew to get stronger (dials/challenging opponents/new moves vs. whatever happens).\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

But as the series continues and Shanks is constantly powered up as a result of the lore that as one of the current Emperors, he will be a worthy adversary for Luffy (among other instances where he's seen in the anime or movies and his mere presence scares people into stopping wars), it increases the mystery of the beginning of One Piece where he lost his arm. We now know Shanks as his history is revealed more as an Emperor of the sea, with control of conquerors haki seen capable of controlling (or scaring really) or knocking out animals and people. \n\nSo why is it that he lost his arm against a simple sea monster? One we know Luffy can beat sleeping even before the timeskip? \n\nObviously the safe and likely answer for a long ass series like this is that Oda possibly hasn't thought about the power scale increasing to such a length and/or wanted to give an emotional stake to Luffy's backstory and motivations. \n\nBut MY question is out of curiosity, if any of you can think of any in-world reasons why Shanks would let a sea beast of that level take his arm?",

For example, Marco’s devil fruit heals him so quickly he doesn’t even register the pain from the majority of attacks. King can tank most anything, Katakuri can dodge most anything, and Marco can heal most anything. \n\nNow obviously this doesn’t really work for Zoro, we don’t know enough about Jesus Burgess to say either way, and I haven’t seen Film Red and have managed to avoid spoilers, meaning I don’t know enough about Ben Beckmann to say. Either way, it’s still a cool little trend imo and it plays a large part in terms of making those 3 feel as powerful as they do- one thing I think Oda does really well with his characters is making them *feel* powerful, and with those 3 especially I think this feeling of being untouchable really plays into this. Anyways, what are y’all’s thoughts on this?",

        "text": "In recent years, the anime \"One Piece\" has gained a massive following and has been lauded by fans and critics alike. However, as someone who has watched the show, I have to say that I believe it is vastly overrated and poorly written.\n\nOne of the most significant issues I have with \"One Piece\" is its lackluster storytelling. The plot often feels convoluted and nonsensical, with random events happening seemingly out of nowhere. It's as if the writers are just throwing everything at the wall and hoping something sticks. The story lacks a cohesive structure, with many story arcs dragging on for far too long and losing their impact as a result.\n\nThe show's pacing is another major problem. It is incredibly slow, with entire episodes devoted to characters simply standing around and talking. It feels like the creators are trying to stretch out the story as much as possible to keep the audience engaged, but in reality, it just ends up being incredibly boring.\n\nFurthermore, the character development in \"One Piece\" is lacking. The main characters are all one-dimensional and rely heavily on tired tropes and stereotypes. They lack any real depth, making it difficult to care about them or their journey.\n\nAnother issue with \"One Piece\" is its over-reliance on filler episodes. These episodes do nothing to advance the story and often feel like a waste of time. It's frustrating to watch, as they detract from the show's overall quality and make it difficult to keep up with the actual plot.\n\nOverall, while \"One Piece\" has some interesting concepts and moments, it ultimately falls short due to its poorly written storytelling, slow pacing, lackluster character development, and over-reliance on filler episodes. It's hard for me to understand the massive following the show has gained, as it simply doesn't live up to the hype.",
