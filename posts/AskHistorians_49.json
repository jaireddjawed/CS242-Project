        "text": "I recently came across [this old webpage](http://www.cindyvallar.com/goldenage.html) about golden age piracy which gives a demographic breakdown for pirates. The author claims that over 50% of golden age pirates originated on the Isle of Britain, mostly English but with significant numbers of Scots and Welsh.  The page also claims that as little as 2% of pirates originated in other European states and that just a little less than half would have originated in the colonies, though exactly which colonies aren’t explained in detail only American and West Indian are given as descriptor.  I always assumed that piracy in the period of the late 17th and early 18th century would have been a more multi-cultural occupation but is that true. Were Brits and British colonists more likely to take up piracy than people from other countries? If so, what led to this great disparity in the demographics of piratical activity? Why were brits so much more likely to take to the seas seeking ill gotten gains?",

        "text": "Hi - I posted this on /books with another title and one suggestion was to post it here. As you might have way more historical context to my question. \nSo I copied it and here goes; \n\nI'm currently reading through the original versions of the Sherlock Holmes books. One thing I have noticed is the amount of money described during their cases. Often it will be in the context of how much a person makes, pays for a certain thing or service. But the one thing I cannot understand is; what did they spend their money on back in the 1860-1890? \n\nAs an example, in one of the stories a man is discribing how much him and his wife, a widower, makes a year.   \nHe tells that his wifes late husband was well off, and made good investments that returned 7% a year, she is discribed as having a fortune of 4500£ - He is said to make around 700£ annually from his business.    \nSo we can calculate their yearly income at 315£ + 700£ = 1015£ annually. Taxes are not discribed, and I do not even know where to begin trying to calculate taxes in the 1880s England.   \nThe shopkeeper tells mr. Holmes that his wife and himself is comfortable and because of this, they afford themselves a house of 80£ a year.   \nMeaning that they pay roughly 8% of their annual income in rent. (I would LOVE to only pay that!)   \nFurthermore in another story a governess is described to make between 35-120£ annually, but 120£ being rare. So for the sake of easy mathmatics, let us use the sum of 50£ annually.   \nThis means this couple could hire a governess easily. I'd assume they could also hire a butler, a maid and perhaps one or two more servants and still not pay more than a combined 200-250£ wages to their servants.   \nSo to recap 1015£ income - 200£ wages of servants - 80£ rent = 735£ remaining for all other expenses. I would imagine that this would leave the couple rather more than \"comfortable\" - I'd wager that it would put them close to being rich, if not wealthy. They are essentially living compleately off of the dividend of the ladys stocks - Not bad.   \n\n\nAm I putting too much thought into the discribed economy of the victorian age?   \n\n\nTLDR: The prices discribed in Sherlock Holmes seems really low compared to the discribed income of the \"customers\"",

This got me wondering about if this type of rhetoric has ever been used before. \n\nMuch like the current conflict, the Vietnam war was a large scale conflict involving one side with a massive nuclear arsenal and the other side being provided military aid by another nuclear armed superpower. The US instituted a draft and was spending huge amounts of blood and resources to fight the war and there were several periods of escalation in that war as well. Despite all of this, ultimately the US was defeated and had a huge smear on their reputation and clout as a superpower at the height of the Cold War. \n\nBeing born after the war and in the United States I only get a certain perspectives on US military history which, as critical as it often is of the Vietnam War, is likely to conveniently leave out some details. \n\nMy question is: **Was there ever a time in the Vietnam War where the US threatened the use of nuclear weapons? Was there any fear in the general public (in the US or elsewhere) that the US would use nukes in the conflict?** \n\nSecondarily, were there serious concerns at the time about the Soviet Union or China taking a more active role in the Vietnam War which would result in US and USSR/CCP soldiers directly trading bullets which would then risk further escalation?",

Here’s a link to a list with what each unit looks like: \n\nhttps://rtw.heavengames.com/rtw/info/units/egyptian/\n\nFor those who don’t want to look through it you see a lot of people shirtless in these short skirt-like garments, headwear that looks kinda like it drapes down the back of a person’s head and along the sides and kind of round flattish headwear for others. The armor some units wear looks something like little scales.\n\nIs this based on another, previous era of Egypt? Like the old, middle, or new kingdom? Or is this just a complete mishmash or orientalist tropes? \n\nIs this based on a specific source or set of imagery? Like how it seems like most Roman soldiers wore mail but almost all of them are depicted as wearing segmented armor cause that’s how it’s depicted in Trajan’s column.",

According to the little amount of records I could find on this family they were fairly prominent throughout their history, took part in the Norman conquest of England as well as Ireland, some settled in wales (where most of my family claims we immigrated from) while others stayed in various parts of England as well as Ireland. \n\nObviously I’m hoping to be somehow related to this family as it seems to have a very rich history. I just can’t get over that my family name has a few more letters and is pronounced slightly different (although most strangers tend to pronounce it the bohun pronunciation), yet everything else seems to corroborate what I already know about my family history. I’m just wondering how often family names morphed in the time of the Bohuns glory days and there after, as well as if anyone has any tips on how to track family lineage this far back.

The button is about 2  inches across, it's round and looks to be made of metal. The button reads \"My Love\" and is written in simple dark font on a plain white background. The film is a mainstream film, a drama with high production values, released by MGM.\n\nMy question is about this button. What does this button have to do, if anything, with the fact that it's being worn by a prostitute? Could it be an indication of her actual profession? Like, could it be a subtle way to attract customers? Or, could it be referring to a political issue, perhaps something about the health and safety of working girls? Why would the director/costume designer choose this button for this character?\n\nI took a screenshot of the scene with a clear image of this button but I'm not being allowed to post it.

Was there enough movement of goods that a courier crew would have fulltime jobs going from city to city transferring objects back and forth? How would they find work? Were they insured in the event of highway bandits? Could someone who had been doing it for a while \"break out on their own\" and start their own business, or was the courier market fairly dominated by a few companies?

Essentially, this character comes from a line of people that are what I described as \"Military Families\", an entire family/lineage is essentially bound by the laws of the state to serve the military in some capacity. The difference being from regular conscription is this is all singular family (families\\*) focused, where different lineages offer service to their lord. I know what you are thinking \"Sounds a lot like nobles\", well, heres the part that throws the wrench into the plan for that. They are not quite given any real noble 'privilieges' for their service, but they get instead tax breaks and better privileges than the rest of the lower classes, in fact part of their job is to be there to SERVE the nobility and act out their will. Are there any real-world historical examples of non-noble families serving in an extended military capacity that carries through generations? Love to find out!",

The idea that Christianity is responsible for the development of hospitals seems to discount any non-western or non-Christian contributions to the development and use of hospitals. My own research into the topic suggests this is not entirely correct. I read the earliest places an individual could receive healing of any kind was in Egyptian and Greek temples. However, the Romans also appear to have constructed spaces (the valetudinaria) specifically to treat slaves, gladiators and soldiers around 100 BCE. The concept of a hospital also seems to have gone through a number of developments in Byzantium and throughout the Arabic world, as well. Could some clarification please be provided?",

And yet, just as they are notoriously influential, they are notoriously thorny reads. Marx is brilliant and methodical but slow moving, complex, and sometimes quite inaccessible. Socialism and communism in all their many variants and branches can be broadly defined by their populism and their embrace of the exploited, and often uneducated, working class. So I wonder, how did Marxist thought, as embodied in these two works, ever gain such popular influence as to feed and sustain the spread of socialism and communism in the 20th century?",

        "text": "It is well-known that Irish-American politicians such as Tip O'Neill and Ted Kennedy sought to use their positions to influence US policy over Northern Ireland from the 1970s to the 1990s, including putting pressure on various US Presidents lean on the British Government.  \n\nAs a Senator with Irish-American roots who served during this period, who was involved in foreign affairs and who reportedly views Northern Ireland as paramount to his relationship with the United Kingdom as President, how involved in these efforts was Joe Biden?",

        "text": "Am doing my dissertation on social media algorithms changing the face of musicianship in the same way that the MTV generation reshaped music videos. To do this im looking to track some of the careers of individuals like Justin Bieber, Bo Burnham and Shawn Mendes. In this research i've found that things get mentioned like \"Shawn Mendes getting 10,000 likes in one day\" and \"Justin Bieber did a lip sync cover of Friday by so and so\". I believe these examples would be invaluable data points for my research, but am not sure where i would actually find discussion and data from these instances. It's not enough that i just give them lip survice, i want to be able to get exact dates, discussions and plot it on a timeline.\n\nMy question is, is there some sort of \"way back machine\" style web site that tracks previous news stories about online news. I'm thinking a kind of internet historian database that where things like a 10,000 like in one day song news article would be found. I know this is a slightly niche thing to be looking for, which is why i've came here. If anybodies gonna know, it's the internet.\n\nThank you very much :).",
