        "text": "Im 33, my wife 27 died suddenly in October. Hypothetically If i ever heal and love again, if i remarry, then when I die and go to heaven, who do I see?\n\nTo expand on this, a great comfort can be found in the belief I will be reunited with my wife in heaven and spend eternity in peace and bliss with her. But in my case I am not old with death just around the corner for me and i have a huge amount of time left on earth to live more than likely. I will hopefully not spend all my remaining days on earth alone in grief and sadness and will love again, perhaps even marry again. But if I do, and I loved my late wife with all my heart and miss her and deeply want to see her again, but I also then find that I love my future wife equally but differently, snd spent my remaining days on earth with her then we both pass away from old age, when i get to heaven, will i be reunited with my first wife and spend eternity with her, will i be reunited with my second wife and spend eternity with her, or perhaps both or something else entirely.\n\nIn the leading two scenarios on or the other is left out, and given the intensity of the bonds we formed, that would end up being very painful for them and me and this is supposed to be a place of bliss without the pain of our mortal lives. And it is not fair.\n\nBut in the scenario with everyone together, then how does that work because i swore an oath of loyalty to love them and only them till death do us part. Which, death did part us. But now we’re beyond death…. How would this possibly work fairly for anyone and again not lead to pain?\n\nI see these as no win situations all and so the only logical and fair choice is to suffer my time on earth alone to simply spend eternity with my once and only wife in heaven. But that is a horrible way to live and i dont think my late wife would even want that for me.\n\nSo im left confused and more than a little scared, and in a crisis of faith and religion too.\n\nI hold what can be described mostly as non-denominational christian beliefs in this context because thats how i was raised and what brings me comfort and familiarity but i am simply spiritual and open to all religions.\n\nTherefore, i would appreciate responses from a multitude of religious backgrounds and faith’s. Including those that do not have a traditional Christian view on the concept or even the existence of heaven. \n\nAll perspectives are welcome and ill find comfort in everything.",

        "text": "It is too easy to critique religion as simply a set of dogmas to adhere to, or silly beliefs about some celestial dictator, that can be readily refuted as illogical. Religion is not about believing in the right god(s); although on a superficial level this has been a major preoccupation.\n\nSacred texts, doctrines and dogmas, although often congruent, are peculiar to each religious tradition. The stark differences between the exoteric tenets of the various world religions are incompatible and are the cause of much antagonism between faiths. Many individuals of the same faith quarrel with each other over pedantic differences in their understanding. What is ubiquitous to the world’s religions, however, are practices of attaining numinousity.\n\nEvery religion, every cultural tradition has some deep insights into the nature of consciousness that we are all entitled to. The spiritual traditions of the world are now the birthright of every human being. These traditions constitute an ecology of practical ways to participate in the transcendent reality. Religious practices are and always have been about connecting with nature, gratitude, singing and chanting, mediation, fasting, prayer, rituals, pilgrimage, ceremony, feasts, holy days and festivals.\n\n&gt;“ … *a natural function which has existed from the beginning, like the religious function, cannot be disposed of with rationalistic and so-called enlightenment criticism. You can, of course, represent the doctrinal contents of the creeds as impossible and subject them to ridicule, but such methods miss the point and do not hit the religious function which forms the basis of the creeds.*” - Carl G. Jung; The Undiscovered Self, p. 19\n\nAt a certain point early human beings began to recognise the way in which certain behaviours, movements, dances, songs, would reliably produce certain states of consciousness. The “*religious function*”, discovered by our prehistoric ancestors, opened them up to experiences of the mysterium tremendum et fascinans. \n\nGradually, performances of these certain behaviours became ritualised and further symbolically elaborated into myth. Eventually, institutional religion, theology, and philosophical attempts to bring rationality to mysticism, to bring logical coherence to the nature of reality as revealed through these numinous experiences. \n\nPractices of achieving altered mind states are found quite ubiquitously in traditional cultures throughout human history and are often associated with mystical or spiritual insight. Many spiritual traditions and practices are derived from ancient shamanic techniques initially used by natives as methods for inducing numinous ecstatic mind states. \n\nShaman employ a range of practices to reach these altered states such as flagellation, fasting, rattling, dancing, drumming, singing, breath control or various forms of meditation; yet none of these methods are as effective, nor as ancient and overwhelming as the use of hallucinogens to produce visions, high doses of which are not taken lightly nor for fun. \n\nThe shaman’s role varies from one culture to the next, however they typically function as priests, sages, seers, prophets, diviners, healers, communicators with the “spirit world”, and the curators of the local religious mythology. \n\nIn many cultures the word “shaman” literally means “one who knows”, “man of knowledge”, or “go between”. The shaman is often proposed by anthropologists to be the “first profession”. Shaman were the original doctors, scientists, councillors and artists. They were also the self appointed keepers of an ancient herbal knowledge and the occult relationship between man and nature’s visionary plants.\n\nTraces of shamanism may be found among peoples who have been converted to other religions, as in the Finno-Ugric peoples who became Christians, Turkic peoples in Central Asia and Asia Minor who became Muslim, and Mongols who became Buddhists. \n\nThe classic archaic model and most complete expression of shamanism is still practiced in the Arctic and Central Asian regions. Among many American Indian peoples and Australian aborigines shamanism constitutes the most important aspect of religious life.",

Other pagan traditions such as hellenism, heathenry, kemetism, celtic paganism as well as semitic and arabian polytheism are no longer practiced by large groups of people and are not mainstream. They have become small religions when they used to have a lot of power and influence over the regions they were practiced in. Obviously, the rise of Christianity, Islam and even buddhism played a huge role in the downfall of many pagan religions. How did hinduism survive throughout all of that into the modern day?",

        "text": "I've never read the book, or seen the show, just so we know. I was just looking up some ted-ed videos about literature and that was one of the books they discussed. This prompted me to go look it up.\n\nTo make a long story short, it tells the story of a dystopian future where fundamentalist Christians take over the US and begin to enforce highly misogynistic polices. Apparently this was inspired by Christian groups protesting second-wave feminism in the 80s. Not to be too fanciful though, the world is mostly based on Puritan society. \n\nThat said, honestly it comes across as bigoted to me. Granted, I don't think much of the Christian Right, but honestly the world of that book isn't what they're trying to create. Truth to be told, it looks more like a world where incels took over. It also seems to assume that all Christians are like the Puritans, even though in reality they're sorta looked down upon by other Christians (mostly due to the 'salem witch trials' thing). \n\nYeah, there's many things to criticize the Christian Right for, but this book doesn't look like the author did any actual research into Christianity. I mean, they're bashing gays and abortion and the teaching of evolution and whatnot, but they're not going around saying that women should be treated like freaking cattle. There's the trad wife thing, but that's more strongly associated with white supremacy than Christianity, and honestly it looks pretty damned tame compared to what that book depicts.\n\nI know its supposed to be a story about complacency, but honestly it comes across to me like a derogatory depiction of Christians. I have pondered myself what such a world may look like, and it wouldn't look anything like that. Honestly, it would be rather benign as long as you're not gay or believe in evolution. Not that I'm saying that's okay, it would be rather horrible, but honestly even my darkest imaginings look like a complete joke to that book. And as stated, honestly I find it hard to believe that Christian men would be willing to treat women like they do in that book. It literally has them committing adultery whenever they please, even though its literally one of the ten commandments to not do that. Oh, and it rarely involves consent, so there's that too. I also find it hard to believe that they would seriously launch a violent take over of the country. There's been a lot of terror attacks in the US over past couple of years, but I've never heard of a single one of them being being motivated by Christianity. Think of the Christian right what you will, they're clearly not interested in a violent take over. And let's not forget here, not all Christians are left-wing, so this Christian right IS receiving criticism even from other Christians. \n\nI also happened to look up that 'banned mormon cartoon' a few days ago (I ran into it some years and years ago). Honestly, I can't help but see parallels between that cartoon and this book. Doing research on that mormon cartoon btw, I've found that it originated from some material put out by some evangelicals to teach people how to convert mormons. Looking up the studio, apparently they also liked to make a lot of media advocating conspiracy theories. In particular, in the sequel to that tape that cartoon originated on they tried to claim that Mormons were part of some grand illuminati-like conspiracy. Clearly, the people who made that cartoon can't be trusted.\n\nMy point is, is the book and the netflix series fundamentally anti-Christian propaganda? The author isn't Christian, and its filled with Christians doing shocking horrible things like you would normally see in bigoted media. I mean, I'm not even Christian myself here and I find it shocking. I definitely won't be reading that book (besides, I never could stand seeing or reading about women being abused, due to my mother's experiences, I even quit some fantasy novel a creative writing instructor recommended to me just because it has a scene near the beginning where some woman is struck by a man). Clearly, media like that isn't for me. There's enough horrible things in the world, and that one thing just hits too close to home for me.",

        "text": "Two months ago, I was with a group of older men and they were discussing how the vast majority of them were atheists, but still believed in a higher power. But that higher power might not be from a classical god.  Something out there that created everything. I had to point out that they were not really atheist. But one of them began to tell me a story of what he thought about religion. \n\nHe claimed all current religion derives from this story and in fact all current religions are false because this story was lost to time. There is a superior alien race on a far away planet. This race has been around close to the beginning of time. They advanced in their society and finally became a race that was able to visit other stars and planets. \n\nBut this race, over time, began to have major problem on their home planet. Their sun was causing havoc on their planet, and the only way to protect their planet was with gold. The gold was used, somehow to create a more powerful magnetosphere. I'm assuming this was because their sun was growing larger and heating up the planet as it was beginning to die?\n\nSo they began to send out missions to neighboring stars. In hopes to find planets that already had life there. Whenever they did find a planet that had life, they would advance the dominate civilization to a level at which they were able to dig for gold. Extract that gold, and have that gold ready for this civilization to pick up at specific times throughout history.  \n\nSo if there were dinosaurs on Mars. They would change the DNA of dinosaurs somehow to allow them to advance to such a level of intelligence, that they were able to learn how to work machines and be able dig for gold and how to smelt that gold, to be ready for extraction when this race came back to pick it up.\n\nNow the problem is, the amount of time in which this race comes to visit each planet that is extracting gold is unknown, it's completely random. And the last time these aliens came to collect their gold was roughly 10,000 years ago. During the time of the Egyptians. He went on about how the pyramids were somehow involved as a temple of worship to those gods. And since these aliens have not been back since then. Language, religion, race, whatever you name it, was able to run wild in different directions. \n\nAfter he told me this story, I simply asked if he was trolling me. He said no. He was dead serious. I went on to then ask him like 50 questions to break down his argument, and at the end of the whole thing, he was firm that this is what he believed and that those aliens were coming back anytime now, to collect all the gold, that stupid humans have been collection for them ever since. This is why we store gold in bulk in just a few locations on the globe. \n\nHas anyone ever heard of a story like this? The more I thought about it after that discussion. I remembered it being extremely close to the original Stargate movie. But some of the plot lines were altered.",

I learned that they thought that bats were linked to the underworld. They also thought there was a “heaven” and a “hell” and that humans’ world was in the middle and had a bit of the two worlds. Now probably everyone knows a bit about shamans, that supposedly they were in contact with the spiritual world.\n\nWith that knowledge we can make a link with religions, by realizing that religions (gods) are mainly spiritual, people that have witnessed god or allah or anything like that in their dreams have witnessed a bit of the spiritual world. \n\nI am christian and when i was a kid i saw the “sun” and someone infront of it with his arms open and then it disappeared when i blinked. What i saw was in a side where the sun doesn’t show. The light and the person had disappeared right after i blinked. Now what if the whole spiritual world was real?\nIt would mean that shamans actually were in contact with it, if our gods are in it too why don’t we all live like natives? \nThey are the ones we should take example of in middle world.\n\nThey were the people that were the closest to the gods. \n\nFor that reason I will try to now dedicate my future into studying all the native tribes and travel the world to discover the truth and the true way to attain the spiritual world",

Especially because what you might think your religion believes might not be what it actually preaches. \n\nEven my religion teachers in jr. high and my current highschool one actually taught me to *not* just read the Bible blind but to understand the recognized meaning and historical context when reading because it’s such a hard piece of writing to digest, it’s hard to understand what it is saying without help and might be misinterpreted. And whenever they taught something, it would always have good reasons to be believed, not just “You should believe that *blank* is right just because,” but that “we should because *blank, blank* and *blank.* (According to Catholic religion.) You don’t need a PHD and spend hours per say, but just *something.*\n\nOn top of all this, even at a young age, I was always taught to not be *that person.* You know the one- the kind that are passive aggressive, shove faith down people’s throats, and always make people of other religions uncomfortable rather than being *a nice human.* Yes we were taught to spread the word of God, but in a way that was respectful, not forceful, and to lay off if they stay their ground. Because yelling at someone to convert, (weather literal or passive aggressively,) is just going to do the exact opposite of your goal, on top of the fact that it’s just the nice and mature thing to do.\n\nSo than why are so many people who claim to be devoted Catholics/Christians/(any religion) do this? I know not everyone goes to religious schools, (the only reason we can afford the one I’m going to is some scholarship program,) but even in confirmation classes I feel like this was made clear, at-least in mine. \n\nAll these people do is drive people away and ruin friendships. They also spread false teachings; I’ve seen people who say they’re catholic say stuff like “if bad things are happening to you, you must be doing something wrong.” Even though many stories in the Bible is basically “Stuff is going to happen- it’s going to be shit, but you need to keep going anyways” (in a more graceful way if saying it obviously.) not only do they spread false information about what we believe God wants from us, but they openly ignore what (we believe) God is saying.\n\nNot only do these people make others feel bad and contradict their own faith, but they give a bad rap saying that *all* Christians are these judgmental people who think that everyone else is evil and stuff. It hurts being on other subs and people using these generalizations too, because me and many people I know aren’t like this.\n\nSorry for the rant, but why do some people do this? I know it’s not intentional, but the way that they treat people is horrible even ignoring all that misinformation stuff.",

        "author": "feanoric",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/10gcys0/on_universality_of_morality_and_religion/",
        "text": "In my religion, Christianity, there is a universal morality, but there is preference for in-group. If someone in Church needs help, ideally Christians have to help other Christians first and then people outside. This is based on St. Paul's letters (as Jesus very rarely interacted with non-Jews). This is also based on common sense, because you cannot help others without first helping your own. It also applies in the context of the family; you have to help your family first in normal circumstances and considering all else more or less equal.\n\nNow, we have to distinguish morality from the rituals. Even in universalist religions it is not required for non-religious people to practice the faith, but it is universally expected for the religious people to practice their morality among each other and themselves.\n\nHowever, I understand that morality is not always universal in every religion. Some realigion may have a special treatment for a group, such as a priest class, or against an enemy such as Canaaneans in the Hebrew Bible... or against people who practice a specific different religion or lack of. Universal morality as today was never really fully sustainable without huge modern states and laws that prevented tribes from killing each other, and I doubt it is the natural state of humans (in-group vs out-group), but in globalized states I think it is a good form of morality.\n\nSome people call non-universal \"hypocrisy\" but there is no reason to assume all morality is universal, and for most of history it never was. These moral systems did not pretend to be universally applied. In the past you were told to love and forgive even enemies in your own tribe, while hating and killing even innocent people from another tribe. This is an extreme example, but usually people had two sets of moral rules for people in the group and people outside. Judaism is a good example of this, they have countless rules for their own people, but they do not believe they apply to people in other countries or even non-Jews living among themselves. On Islam I cannot say, but it seems they do have a base universal moral system, especially for monotheists.\n\nI'd say that the closest way we have today to how people in the past saw their enemy tribes is how people in the west think about Nazis. As pure evil, almost as demons and unredeemable. In fact, it is almost taboo talk about a \"good nazi\" even when it is easy to think about a \"good communist\" or \"good capitalist\". I think the reason is, of course, how evil nazis were, but it gives us a glimpse of how strong hate felt for our ancestors. It is hard for us to understand how much people in the past hated enemy tribes, and later other countries, but reading some history, people killing babies and selling women as slaves was common until a few hundred years ago.\n\nNeedless to say, religious morality evolves as any other and no religion denies this. Every religion has a moral school (or multiple) but that does not mean that moral school is exactly as it was 3000 years ago, nor pretends to. There is also a common, secular morality around that changes faster, but it has its own flaws as any other moral system and often it has problems reconciliating people with totally different values, which is a huge problem in the West, such as when migrants and refugees come. I guess the tradeoff is that more universal moral systems are more relativistic, while more specific moral systems are less relativistic.",

A few years ago I started to really get invested in my Turkic side of the family and culture, because I feel like I have been starved of their influence (sorry for the dramatization) Well, as I was researching my roots and my culture and started to learn the language by myself because my father sadly forgot a lot of it since moving abroad, I found out that before we became Muslims we actually had our own religion, the religion of the Mongolian and Turkic people, which is Tengrism. The few things I’ve found out about it made me feel so…understood?! It resonated so much with me, more than any other believe system ever did. The things is, the more I researched it the more I realized that there are nearly no sources on the internet or otherwise (like books for example, at least I could not find any) to learn about rituals, prayers and just the whole system in general. I know about some things, like throwing water when a loved one is going on a journey (which my grandma always used to do when we visited her and had to leave again) and the evil eye talisman as well, but other than that I don’t know anything. Is there anyone in the infinite depths of the internet who could possibly help me? I’d really appreciate it, thanks in advance.",
