        "text": "Masha Gessen, writing for the *New York Review of Books*, and Mark Adomanis, writing for *Forbes*, have gotten into an extended and rather acerbic debate over the last week about whether Russia is in a demographic crisis or not. \n\nTheir exchange is as interesting for the composite picture they sketch of Russia as for what their mutual criticisms tell us about the pitfalls of presenting and interpreting statistical data:\n\n**[Masha Gessen: The Dying Russians](http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/sep/02/dying-russians/)**\n\n&gt;If this is true—if Russians are dying for lack of hope, as they seem to be—then the question that is still looking for its researcher is, Why haven’t Russians experienced hope in the last quarter century? Or, more precisely in light of the grim continuity of Russian death, What happened to Russians over the course of the Soviet century that has rendered them incapable of hope?\n\n**[Mark Adomanis: 8 Things Masha Gessen Got Wrong About Russian Demography](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2014/09/03/8-things-masha-gessen-got-wrong-about-russian-demography/)**\n\n&gt;As one of a very small number of people who closely follow Russian demography, and as someone who would like the issue to receive more attention, I was extremely disappointed [in Gessen's summary of Russian population trends]. Gessen’s article is so littered with factual errors that it would actually subtract from a non-specialist’s knowledge of the topic: someone who knew nothing about Russian demography before reading the article would end up believing a number of things that are not true.\n\n* Bonus link: [In the comments section](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2014/09/03/8-things-masha-gessen-got-wrong-about-russian-demography/?commentId=comment_blogAndPostId/blog/comment/1575-3236-6894), a user called Bill Nagel posted some critical points of his own about Adomanis's piece, which Adomanis actually responded to, but without addressing any but one of his points.\n\n**[Masha Gessen: Russia’s Dying: A Postscript](http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/sep/08/russias-dying-postscript/)**\n\n&gt;Mark Adomanis claims to have found eight errors in my piece on Michelle Parsons’ and Nicholas Eberstadt’s books on Russian demographics. To prove his points, he gets extremely selective with dates data [..]. [E]ven if we use the Rosstat figures, they will show nothing like the decisive and sustained reversal of the depopulation trend that Adomanis claims has occurred.\n\n**[Mark Adomanis: Russian Demography and Useful Idiocy](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2014/09/09/russian-demography-and-useful-idiocy/)**\n\n&gt;Russia’s recent health improvements are real and significant (their duration, on the other hand, is a matter of genuine scholarly debate). That is not an opinion of the tinfoil hat brigade, but of numerous professional demographers. Desperately pretending otherwise, as Gessen attempts to do, is an exercise in exactly the sort of politicized propaganda that she decries.\n\nIn the end, neither of the authors comes out looking particularly good (Gessen, in my view, worse than Adomanis), but in the course of their debate they do succeed in digging up an informative range of data, allowing us to weigh each of their arguments in comparison. And  they also instructively demonstrate some of the unfortunate ways in which writers, when all too wedded to their theses, can be tempted into selectively or misleadingly presenting and interpreting data.",
