However, I learned today that even though most folks fall under the hidden description, some are genuinely cool. \n\nI do tech support for that one fruity phone company and a guy came in with an issue and described what he’d done to fix it. This was my goofy self’s time to shine and I figured I’d share the tidbit that made the rest if the day bearable.\n\n\nCustomer: I’ve tried everything! Turning it off and on again, resetting all settings, restoring it to factory settings, prayer, and even unicorn horn dust.\n\nMe: Well was the dust freely given or taken through an act of aggression? Where did you get it from? \n\nC: Third party source. Now that I think about it, it did smell of ancient conflict.\n\nM: See that’s why you gotta get your stuff from places that are UWB certified. The Unicorn Wellness Beaureu makes sure that all their stuff is legit. It’s more expensive but it’s a superior product.\n\n\nThis, of course, was interspersed with srsbsnss but the fact that the customer played along let me build a rapport and made the whole thing more pleasant for both of us. It was a very fun chat with a genuine Entertainer that really made my day. Didn’t get a survey from them, but after the smile I had during the chat, I’m not even bothered!\n\nEdit: some spelling",

        "text": "Resigned like 2 weeks ago. It wasn't as dramatic as I once thought. I gave a two week notice which quickly turned into a one week notice with some \"I dont give a fuck\" behavior of mine being displayed like 3 hour breaks (lol) because I just couldn't do it anymore. I thought knowing I had just 2 weeks left would make this less boring but nope. It just made me more inpatient and I couldn't resist myself. \n\nHere is my last call, nothing special, but a beautiful memory. I had taken a 30 min break (instead of 15) and had come from my 3 hour lunch (instead of 1 hour). I got to spend an hour with a crazy lady before this one. I had just 10 minutes left until I could sign my resignation letter when I heard a weird \"beep\" on my left ear. In order to avoid getting another call I need to employ some auto-in calculus. \n\n-Me: Intro\n\n-Cx: I had an appointment....\n\n-Me internally: Oh hell no, there is no appointment in this account. Im fucked. \n\n-Cx: But I cancelled it so I want to make a new one\n\n-Me internally: Thank god\n\n-Me: Ok sure, let me pull up the appointments and I will get you the soonest one so we fix your issue as soon as possible. (IT related issue-sending tech out)\n\n**Hold**\n\nNow it has just been like 2 minutes, I still have 8 more to go and Im not taking another call. ACW is quickly pressed on the Avaya so if the call drops and we happen to be back to back I can waste time trying to call him back. I had 5 min of auto-in after talking with that lady so this needs to last at least 3 more minutes but Ill try to make it last 8 more minutes. Will I be able to find a way to pretend Im busy for 8 minutes? \n\nI quickly pull up the appointments and see we have something in 2 days. I need to waste time so I will give him something in 3 days first...\n\n**Back with cx**\n\n-Me: ~~Wassup my dude~~ I found something in 3 days but I know thats a long wait and its unacceptable so if you dont mind Im gonna try and get you something sooner. Please just stay with me on the line\n\n-Cx: Yes please, thanks.\n\n**Hold**\n\nSo now I just change the date to the appointment I had in 2 days. It has been 4 minutes now. I just have 6 more to go. With this 2 minute hold I will take it down to 6 minutes and god will just need to give me 3 min of auto-in cause Im gonna use 1 min of ACW (more and my name will probably be heard by everyone in the center as random supervisor screams it and tells me to go back to auto-in which shouldnt matter because Im leaving now that I think about it...).\n\nI quickly do a dirty old trick and find something sooner. Instead of 2 days it will be 1 day of waiting. I grab the 1 day appointment before its taken and proceed to blatantly lie to dear cx\n\n**Back with cx**\n\n-Me: Good news, I was able to find something in 2 days, but I still want to do my best so if you just give me like 2 more minutes I will try and find something even sooner\n\n-Cx: Ok thanks I will wait\n\n**Walk back and forth for 2 minutes while on hold since I already grabbed that sooner appointment**\n\n**Goes back with cx**\n\n-Me: As I said sir, I was able to find something sooner. Youll get the tech there in just a day instead of two. This was the soonest we had. So now that we scheduled your appointment is there anything else I can help you with?\n\n\n-Cx: No thanks \n\n\n10 minutes passed by. No acw used required, just logged out. A perfect example of auto-in calculus. I proceeded to sign my resignation and find true happiness in the drive back home lol!",

        "text": "So today was a bit slow. Not many calls but I had some paperwork to work on today so I didn't mind. This is also why, when I got a call that I don't typically handle, I decided to be nice and take a look into it for the caller anyway so she wouldn't have to wait for the standard 10-15 minutes in the queue she was *supposed* to go to.\n\n\n\nMe: What can I do to help you today?\n\n\n\nRude Chick: I'm trying to enter this card number into the website to bill this customer, but it's not working.\n\n\n\nMe: I see. When you type it in what is the decline message?\n\n\n\nRC: I don't know. I got out of that screen.\n\n\n\nMe: Okay. Let's see if I can get it to pull up again, will you give me the card number?\n\n\n\nRC: *mumbles*\n\n\n\nMe: Sorry hun, I didn't catch that, could you repeat that for me?\n\n\n\nRC: *mumbles slightly louder*\n\n\n\nMe: I am so sorry but I still didn't hear you-\n\n\n\nRC: *putting phone directly in front of her mouth and yelling so loud I still can't understand the first part*-9! 8! 7! 5!!\n\n\n\nMe: Ma'am.... I understand why you're frustrated right now but when you yell at me like that it's hard to understand and I can't help you. Let's just take it a few numbers at a time, ok?\n\n\n\nI finally manage to get the number from her and get a decline message telling me basically something is wrong and to get another form of payment.\n\n\n\nMe: Alright RC, it says that it was declined and to get another form of payment. I can't see exactly what the issue is but my best advice for you is to let the customer know he needs to call our customer support team, and in the meantime he does need to give you a different card or cash or something to make sure you will still be paid for your services.\n\n\n\nRC: Can't I just talk to them and get it fixed? \n\n\n\nMe: Unfortunately no, this likely is a funding issue and we can't speak to you about this customer's account information. He will need to to call in so we can tell him what to do to get the card up and running again. \n\n\n\nRC: Well why don't you just tell me what it is without giving me account information?\n\n\n\nMe: I can't, I don't have access because I work with our partners like you and not the customers. \n\n\n\nRC: Then why am I even talking to you? I want to talk to someone who can actually DO something!\n\n\n\nMe: I *have* done something. I checked the card and found out that this is not a website or hotel issue and I've given you steps to take to resolve it. The customer needs to call us and you need to collect another method of payment for him, or you may not be paid. I'm trying to help you as best as I can.\n\n\n\nRC: I want to talk to someone with access to his account who can make the card work.\n\n\n\nMe: I can transfer you, but if he doesn't have any money on his card there is nothing we can do and we can't give you much information since you're not the cardholder.\n\n\n\nRC: So he's broke?? \n\n\n\nMe: I don't know. There are several things it could be, none of which we can discuss with anyone but the cardholder. Please tell him to call the number on the back of his card.\n\n\n\nRC: You know what? I want your supervisor. You sound *lazy*. \n\n\n\nMe: .... One moment please.\n\n\n\nI put her on hold, and took a few deep breaths to calm down. It seems silly that she got under my skin so badly but she was VERY condescending and that bothers me personally quite a bit. Then I decided to notate the account to make sure my supervisor could pull it up when she spoke with RC. Wouldn't want to be *lazy* and leave vague notes. An email from a co-worker popped up, asking me a question about some invoices I had looked into the other day, that was pretty important so I had to respond to that right away. \n\n\nNow I'm thinking it might be best if I walk over to my boss's desk and tell her about the call before I send it over. Wouldn't want to be a jerk and cold transfer, you know? It's only across the hall and I needed to stretch my legs, I'd been sitting all day and that's just lazy. On my way over one of the newbies asked me a question about a call she was taking, I'm a team player so of course I stopped to listen and tell her how to fix the problem. I got over to my boss's desk and explained what happened, she rolled her eyes and told me to send it over.\n\n\n\nWouldn't you know it, by the time I got back she had hung up. I guess in my attempt to be thorough and not *lazy* I had taken too long for RC. Called over to my boss, said she hung up and shrugged, then took the next call. She never did get over to our department again so either she got the right queue and they told her the same thing I did or she took my advice and had the cardholder call in. \n\n\n\nYes I'm petty as hell.",

        "text": "Okay, so I’m on this Reddit because I now also work in a CC. But here is a story of something that I did many years ago that I feel a bit bad for. \n\nBack story:\n\nI had a bad medical Injury from a high up fall that caused me to lose my job for missing time, need two surgeries and a couple rounds of PT. Before this I had a credit score in the mid 700s. I always paid my bill.\n\nI tried to keep up, but interest and late fees kept piling up. This whole ordeal with my injury took about two years. Eventually, I couldn’t keep up with my prior financial obligations, and I fell behind on pretty much everything other than food, rent, and utilities. My score dropped into the 500s and eventually I claimed bankruptcy. \n\nSo, as you can imagine, during this time, I got many calls from bill collectors. I’d try to be nice and apologize that I couldn’t pay but not give them my life story. I know people don’t care, and I’m not looking for sympathy. I know their job is to push, typically I’d just be polite, then hang up. \n\nSo I get this one lady who was being absolutely nasty to me. This was like 6 years ago so I can’t remember verbatim what was said, but she was telling me that I should “be an adult and pay your bills.” \n“You should be ashamed of yourself” “You shouldn’t be charging up a credit card and not paying it back.” \n\nThen a few other things, honestly during this time, from being cooped up I was pretty depressed. So telling me these things when I already feel like a loser, kinda struck a chord. \n\nAt one point I told her “you know, I know this is your job, but I had a medical issue that caused me a lot of hardship. Prior to this I always paid my bills. Everyone has a story.” \n\nI had never experienced anything like that, from a bill collector, but I guess they have different approaches. \n\nSo, I said “you know, I’m having a hard time believing someone with a legitimate company would talk the way you are. Can I have your full name, and company name again?” \n\n...being sassy, she spells her name out for me. \n\nWhile still on the phone with her, I look her up on Facebook and start quoting things off her public page. \n\nShe immediately gets a little timid and defensive \n“I don’t care! I don’t care.” \n\nI made a couple of jokes about her and she finally hung up. \n\nI never looked her up again, but I’m going to guess she made her page private after that. \n\nLooking back now, it was a little crazy I did that, but she was being so rude and the idea just struck me.

It's a little bit long but this is the nightmare I endure on the regular.\n\nme: Hi your speaking with teddirez, can I start with your policy number please\n\ncustomer (c): what was your name? peter??\n\nme: no it was teddirez\n\nc: thanks kevin, listen.. you people sent me a letter saying my premiums have gone up, i just want to pay the same as last year nothing has changed rant rant rant\n\nme: that's no good, let me see what I can do about that, do you have the policy number handy there?\n\nc: I don't have it\n\nme: it should be on the letter we sent you, top right.\n\nc: ...... no it's not there\n\nme: in big bold letters, usually starts with XXX (it's clear as day on every letter we send)\n\nc: i can't see it.\n\nme: that's no problem, I can find you with your name, date of birth &amp; address\n\nc: yeah it's Betty (not real name)\n\nme: thanks Betty, your full name, date of birth and address?\n\nc: don't my details come up with my phone number?\n\nme: yes they do, but for privacy we need to ensure we're speaking to the right person\n\nc: \\*sigh\\* Betty Smith\n\nme: \\*internal sigh\\* thanks again Betty, and your date of birth and address please?\n\nc: i don't like giving out my date of birth\n\nme: i know, no one does but we have to unfortunately\n\nc: \\*another sigh\\* it's five (beep) ten, nineteen (beep)\n\nme: i'm sorry Betty, sounded like you might be pushing some buttons there on the phone and I missed what you said\n\nc: i wasn't pushing any (beep)ns\n\nme: sometimes if you're not quite holding holding the phone right it happens (makes finger gun salute to my temple)\n\nc: I (beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep)\n\nme: i'm still getting the button noise Betty and I missed it again\n\nc: let me put on your speaker phone\n\nme: no no that's o...\n\nc: hang on\n\nme: (looks for somewhere to hang a noose)\n\nc: ^(is that better)\n\nme: not really, you're very quiet now. nevermind lets keep moving. your date of birth and address please\n\n# c:  6 7 1956  47 abc st mytown\n\n(now with the phone IN her mouth or something and me madly hitting down on the volume)\n\nme: ok thankyou, yes I can see your premium has gone up $40 over last year  (in the grand scheme of things $40 month is sweet fa)\n\nc: yes nothing has changed but now my car is worth less and the price has gone up\n\nme: that does happen unfortunately, insurance works on risk, our business costs typically increase just like everyone else like electricity etc.\n\nc: when I made a claim they said my premium wouldn't go up\n\nme: that's right, we're protecting your no claim bonus\n\nc: but it's still gone up and you people said it would\n\nme: well it hasn't gone up due to your claim, but as I said there are dozens and dozens of factors that come into pricing, including your age the age of the car, number of accidents in the area in general. you're still receiving all our other discounts and of course our wonderful service. ;-P\n\nc: can't you do any better?\n\nme: as you've utilised our claims service recently, we haven't increased your premiums as a direct result but we can't offer any further over and above all the ones you're already receiving\n\nc: I couldn't be bothered ringing around, i'll just pay it\n\nme: (finally) ok will that be visa mastercard or amex?\n\nc: it's a mastercard visa\n\nme: (i'll work it out, just say the numbers) ok go ahead with the numbers\n\nc: it's 4 5 6 4 (that's visa) twenty 6\n\nme: is that 26 or 2 0 6?\n\nc: 4 5 6 4 (alright already I got that) twenty 6\n\nme: (oh ffs) \n\nwe get there eventually, pretty sure she said batman symbol or something along the way\n\nme: ok I just need the 3 digit CCV number on the back\n\nc: I was told not to give that out or people can take my money\n\nme: (lol) yes that's right, we need it in order to process your payment.

Boy I've got some good stories, but for now this one in particularly is in my head.\n\nI was transferred an escalation for a customer who refused to verify HIPAA. As a Health Insurance company, this was obviously a huge deal!  \n\nTo be compliant, the customer needed to verify their Phone #, Name, and DoB.  \n\nThis customer was more than happy to provide the previous rep with his Date of Birth and phone number, but refused to verify his name, eventually asking for a supervisor. \\*Enter Me\\*\n\nMe: Hello, this is Hawwk, I'm a supervisor with XXXX Insurance, how can I help you today sir.  \nCx: Yes, I'd like to \\*blah blah blah\\* (can't remember exactly what he needed, it was a long time ago) and your representative was being very unhelpful.  \nMe: \\*Obligatory \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience statement\"\\* and I'll be more than happy to help with that, but first, for the protection of your information, I need to ask you to verify your Name, Phone number, and DoB.  \nCx: \"\\*Phone #, DoB\\*\"  \nMe: \"And your name sir?\"  \nCx: Why do you people keep asking for my name? You have my Phone # and my DoB, you should be able to see me in your system by now!  \nMe: Yes, I do see your name on my end, but in order to verify your identity, I need you to confirm it.  \nCx: Well, I don't feel the need to verify it when you have it there in front of you. Are you going to help me or not?\n\nNow, his issue was easy to fix, and I knew it could be done within a few moments. I was having a decent day, so I tried an alternative method. (name obviously changed for privacy)\n\nMe: Okay sir, in that case I have your name as \"Jimothy Antwhite\". Is that correct?  \nCx: No, that's not my name! My name is Timothy Antwhistle!  \nMe: Thank you for confirming your identity sir, now I can help you with your issue.  \nCx: ...\n\nThe few seconds of silence that followed where it took him a second to realize what I did was fantastic, and it was less than a minute before I had him off the line.\n\nTL;DR Patient wouldn't verify his name, so I read back a slightly incorrect name on file and tricked him into correcting me.\n\nEdit: formatting",

        "text": "I work in a call center for a clothing retailer. There is a ladies' cotton dress that lots of women order from us year after year, and which sells out early in the season. Leftover inventory at the end of the season is deeply discounted and usually consists of hard-to-find sizes and includes last year's colors.\n\nMy skinny Queen B customer called yesterday asking about the dress. She was one of those rude people who calls from the car and leaves the phone on speaker in the passenger seat so you can barely hear them, and who has a million questions but interrupts you every time you open your mouth.\n\nIn between interruptions I manage to let her know that this year's colors are earthy with some pastels thrown in. She spends a few minutes whining about this year's colors and then asks about one of last year's leftover colors -- a jewel tone. I tell her that we do have her size (00) in that color. She asks, \"Well how many do you have?\" We're not supposed to tell people the exact number, but she kept hammering me with the question, and so I told her: One. We have one. (True.) And it's on sale for half price. She still hemmed and hawed. I start knitting as she mutters to herself and just let her trail off. Then she says, \"Well, I'll have to call you back. I'm in the car and I have a 20% off coupon at home.\" At which time I advise her that if she buys the dress now, she can still call us when she gets home and we can give her a credit for the 20% off retroactively. That way she can be sure not to miss out on this, the last dress in the color she wants. She said no, implied that I was trying to cheat her in some way, then hung up abruptly.\n\nGuys, I was honestly trying to save this \"lady\" a buck, and she was so rude!\n\nSo the minute I got off work, I went online and bought that last jewel-toned dress in Size 00.\n\nI'm a Size 16 and don't even know anyone that skinny. But Queen B can go hang.\n\nGuess I'll x-post at r/pettyrevenge",

I know where it is you just need to get it back to me\n\n(Me): and the LP team will do just that! But you have to be speaking to them and not me, if I could just give you the contact details you'll be in touch with them in no time\n\n(C): I'm not doing that! I'm talking to you right now and you need to fix this right now in case anyone picks it up\n\n(Me): You definitely should contact them as soon as possible in case something like that happens, but as Ive explained you have to be speaking to the LP team, that's what they're there for\n\n(C): Well that's it then! If you won't help me then your company has stolen my property and I'll be getting in touch with the police, so give me my phone now\n\n(Me): The first thing the police will ask you is if you've contacted lost property, which you haven't, they will then tell you to contact lost property as it's not yet a police matter \n\n(C): Well then you'll be hearing from my solicitor about your illegal business and stealing of lost property\n\n(Me): That's fine, but again you still haven't followed the LP procedure and as we both know the quicker you do that the more chance you have of getting it back\n\n(C): Then you need to start helping me and get me my phone back!! I've been trying but you aren't doing anything!\n\n(Me): As I've explained before, we don't handle LP and I'm more than happy to put you in touch with the people who do \n\n(C): Fine then, give me your name, I'm going to write to your employer about your horrible customer service and that you stole my phone\n\n(Me) Yeah no worries, I'm LegitLogia and I can give you the email or physical address for where to send your complaint if you'd like? But you'd be better off writing to LP first as that would help to get your phone back otherwise you'll just be referred to them by customer service \n\n(C): F*ck you and your bullsh*t company stealing people's f*cking phones, I'm going to the police the newspapers and I'll be telling everybody about how f*cking horrible you were\n\n(Me): haha okay then have a lovely day *hangs up*\n\n\nThis is partly paraphrased as it was the other day, but this is a common occurrence as our number is the first point of call for customers, most people are fine with it but a good amount really don't want to \"jump through hoops\" and go to the lost property team instead. Kind of funny how they'll spend 15 minutes arguing with you about how time is of the essence when they could've spoke to the people who could actually help in 5.\n\nPeople don't want a solution, they want to be mad.",

        "text": "I worked for a third party logistics company for a few years and we did home deliveries of large items for a few big retailers. One of the retailers needed a signature for their deliveries so people would have to take time from work since we didn’t typically do weekend or after hour deliveries. \n\nWell one day I get a customer who requested to speak to a manager so I got the pleasure of speaking with them. After reading the tracking notes, we had been unable to contact the guest so no appointment had been set up. For some reason, the guest took off work expecting it to be that day although there had been zero communication between us and through a fit that we didn’t know to deliver. \n\nThe customer was screaming for a few minutes and I kept trying to explain to him but had no luck as I wasn’t able to talk. Regardless of if we scheduled something or not, he did take off work so I decided to try to help him since I don’t have unlimited PTO and I thought that the policy of making people miss work is bull. I managed to calm him down and told him I’d call him back with an update since I’d have to find someone to run this to him. \n\nWell I start making some calls and I get an email forwarded to me from our customer service box which reads as follows; \n\nTitle: DELIVERY SERVICE BLOWS\n\nHad to take an afternoon off for you ignorant cocksuckers to deliver only to have you call after the delivery time to tell me no one verified delivery. WRONG. Your time is more important than mine. Fuck you! I hope everyone in your company and family gets incurable cancer and dies a slow agonizing death you worthless piece of shit. Go fuck yourselves\n\n\nDeciding this was something that required immediate attention, I look up the email address in our system and lone behold, it was the same customer. After figuring that out I made the decision to call the customer and tell him that we are not going to deliver the item today or ever and that we were sending it back to the shipper. \n\nAs you can imagine, the customer lost their mind. After a pretty lengthy tirade filled with profanity and threats, I disconnected the call with a smile on my face. \n\nA week later another supervisor call comes through and wouldn’t you know, it’s him. He reordered the item but this time was as nice as could be and played dumb about the whole ordeal so I also played dumb. I told him I would get it delivered ASAP and would call him with an update about what day we can deliver it.\n \nAt the end of the day he called me back and I told him we were also sending this one back as well and that we would not ship anything for him going forward. As you can imagine, he lost his mind again.\n\nAll of this for a cheap plastic kayak.... \n\n\nTL:DR; Customer wished incurable cancer on coworkers and family so we sent their item back and banned them from shipping with us again ",

        "text": "It's been a weird week, we've had a lot of people calling us over and over again in the same day which is pretty unusual. There's only 5 of us and we all sit in the same area so we can hear and discuss the calls we just had, it helps when this happens so that we can all be on the same page and just say the same thing. While a lot of calls have been awful this week this one was one of the worst and had the most satisfying ending, at least to me. Brace yourself, it's long!\n\n\n\nThis person, who is a contracted business partner of ours, wanted to change bank account information. My company requires this to be faxed in, I know it's old fashioned and emails are easier but it's our policy and I have to stick to it. That doesn't mean an email can't be used later if there's a problem, it just means we have to try the fax first. I was the first person he spoke to on the day all of this happened. \n\n\n\nMe: *opening spiel* How can I help you?\n\n\n\nImpatient Person: I sent you a fax TEN DAYS AGO to change my bank account and you didn't get it. NO ONE TOLD ME, so I faxed it again and I need a confirmation it was received.\n\n\n\nMe: Sorry about that, sir, when did you re-fax it?\n\n\n\nIP: Like ten minutes ago.\n\n\n\nMe: I see. Unfortunately, our faxes come through electronically, not just like a paper from the machine. We get hundreds of faxes a day so this makes it a bit easier for us. It *can* take up to 48 hours for us to show that a fax was received, but generally it only takes an hour or two to receive and sort it to the right place.\n\n\n\nIL: This is BULLSHIT, I've already had to wait ten days and the last time I called I was transferred THREE TIMES until I got to the right person, just for them to tell me it didn't come through. I WANT A CONFIRMATION!\n\n\n\nMe: That's understandable, but I definitely won't be able to tell yet. If you can call my department in a couple of hours, I can check with the person who recieves this information and confirm it for you. If they don't have it, we'll try something else and do our best to make sure we get this to the right person today. It will still take another day to change and take effect so I recommend not billing anything until then.\n\n\n\nIP: Unbelievable. What kind of business are you people running where you can't get faxes even though I have a confirmation page??\n\n\n\nMe: Those are confirming the fax was sent, not received. It is important to follow up with us and make sure we got it because we don't know you're sending it, so we can't let you know it didn't come through.\n\n\n\nIP: I had to get through three departments just to get to you! \n\n\n\nMe: When you call back use 1-800-555-5555 to get straight to us, then you don't have to get bounced around and we'll just confirm it for you or escalate it from there if it hasn't come in.\n\n\n\nIP: Where do these faxes even *go??*\n\n\n\nMe: The department responsible for entering that information.\n\n\n\nIP: How many departments do you even have??\n\n\n\nMe: A lot. \n\n\n\nIP: This is unacceptable, after TEN DAYS-\n\n\n\nMe: *done with it* I'm not asking you to wait another ten days. I'm asking you to wait two hours.\n\n\n\nIP: *hangs up*\n\n\n\nPeople hanging up on us is nothing new, I just rolled my eyes, notated what happened, and moved on. I was not totally unsympathetic and I was prepared to let him just email it to me, I would personally send it over to the right place if we still didn't have it when he called back. That department doesn't take calls so that's the only way I could make sure we got it and it would be done. So we all can follow along, that \"department\" is one person not at our location so we can't transfer to them or go talk to them. They do data entry from home, not in our state. We talk to them via email or IM. This is important later.\n\n\n\nThe next time he called, he got one of my coworkers. I'll use fake names for my coworkers to make it easier to follow :) This is the conversation they had according to \"Amy\":\n\n\n\nAmy: Looks like we received your fax, sir! Now it just needs to be entered. The person who does this is aware of the wait you had so she is going to get to it as soon as possible, but even if she did it right now it won't take effect until tomorrow. Please call us directly at your convenience tomorrow and we'll confirm it for you and help you submit your billing that's had to wait for this to get updated.\n\n\n\nIP: I want it done NOW. I will not wait a second longer your company has had over a week to take care of this!!\n\n\n\nAmy: I'm sorry but it does take time for our system to get this entered properly so we can make sure we send your money to the right place. \n\n\n\nIP: I've had to call over and over and over and I'm sick of it! I want this resolved RIGHT NOW before I hang up!!\n\n\n\nAmy: I can't make this go any faster for you but you could email this person at (support email) and I'm sure she'll be happy to email you when it's done and I can tell you the steps to take now to submit your pending invoices so you don't have to call and can just submit them when she lets you know?\n\n\n\nIP: So you can't do anything? What good are you to anyone?\n\n\n\nAmy: I know you're upset but I'm trying to help you as best as I can, sir.\n\n\n\nIP: Worthless. *hangs up*\n\n\n\nAmy is tough and experienced but no one likes being called worthless. She was mad but after a quick vent to us she brushed it off and took another call. Guess who calls in 10 minutes later and gets another coworker?\n\n\n\nJesse: How can I help you today?\n\n\n\nIP: I want to talk to Amy.\n\n\n\nJesse: She's not available, but I'm happy to help what's going on?\n\n\n\nIP: She gave me this email address to reach the person who changes the bank information and no one has replied yet. I want to make sure she even gave me the right address since she couldn't do anything else right.\n\n\n\nJesse is our most senior rep. She trained Amy and me, and is very close with all of us. The call took a colder turn after this, lol.\n\n\n\nJesse: Spell the email you have out.\n\n\n\nIP: supportemail@company.com.\n\n\n\nJesse: That is the correct address. You will have to wait for a response.\n\n\n\nIP: Can't you confirm my email even went through? Your faxes are awful I can assume your email servers are just as bad.\n\n\n\nJesse: No one here has access to that email, so I can't confirm that. The only person who has access is not at this office. You'll have to wait for them to email you back. \n\n\nIP: *hangs up*\n\n\n\nJesse sits right next to me so I heard her side and she told me it was IP again, likely now calling over and over until he heard what he wanted to hear. Sure enough, my phone rings. \n\n\n\nMe: This is sh605, what can I do for you today?\n\n\n\nIP: I want to talk to Amy.\n\n\n\nMe: She's on another call, can I help?\n\n\n\nIP: I JUST TALKED TO HER!\n\n\n\nMe: When did you call?\n\n\n\nIP: Like 5 minutes ago!! (Not true, closer to 15 or 20 at this point.)\n\n\n\nMe: She's since taken another call and is unavailable.\n\n\n\nIP: LIAR! I'M NOT GETTING OFF THE PHONE UNTIL I TALK TO HER AND SHE EXPLAINS WHY I HAVEN'T GOTTEN AN EMAIL BACK-\n\n\n\nMe: She doesn't monitor that email. Only our coworker who is out of state does. Amy cannot do anything about this.\n\n\n\nIP: I'm going to wait until she's off the phone-\n\n\n\nMe: Not on my line, you won't. \n\n\n\nThat was the most satisfying push of the release button I've ever had. I quickly IM the group his phone number, and we all stopped answering his calls until we clocked out, which was really only about 20 minutes later. The best part is our IM group includes the receptionist who answers and directs calls from our main number, and she told us he had called her yelling that we weren't taking his calls. She told him she can't make us answer the phone, and he hung up on her while just screeching nonsense. He hasn't called back since.\n\n\n\nI also emailed our coworker out of state, who let me know his paperwork has fallen to the bottom of the pile and likely wouldn't be done til the next day. Which was Friday. Meaning his changes won't take effect til Monday :) Petty revenge but still made it that much better.",

        "text": "I've worked at call centers before. They haven't been too bad. I could tolerate them. The work was not absolutely terrible. I left the call-center industry because I wanted to work in other fields. A few years passed and I decided to come back to work at a call center. I mean, why would it be hard? It wasn't hard the other times I've worked in a call-center.  I struggled a little bit at first when I went back. My call times were higher than they should have been, but I had great customer survey scores and my Quality Assurance was decent. Overall, I was a great employee. I was dependable, hard-working, respectful and was aware of the expectations that were given to me. Then, something hits me like a brick wall. \n\nI start to despise the voices of the customers that speak to me. Many customers start to sound like one-dimensional clones of each other. I know what they will say, and I know what they will unreasonably expect. They are entitled. They are liars. They are irresponsible. They are illogical. The only customers who seem to be genuinely good end up getting screwed over and there is nothing I can do to assist them. I still use empathetic words, but without any feeling. Yet, I still genuinely empathize with the customers whose anger is justified. I am frustrated with them and for them. \n\nI received a customer compliment call, but the manager gave the credit to another employee. I've received acknowledgement from this manager before, but why give the other credit to another employee? Then, I received a QA ding, and my survey scores took a dramatic dive. The most discouraging part is that I never showed any outwards disrespect to any customers and the reason that they gave me such a low survey score is because of the company. Not me. I've seen the customer's reason. Yet, the scores are still tied to me. Upper management see numbers, not the reasons. Now I will have to receive 'extra help' because of survey scores I had absolutely no control over.\n\nMy attendance was perfect until I had to come into work late. I was less than an hour late due to an emergency. I've never once missed a day. I have a demerit on my records now. They cannot work with me. \n\nI want to leave. Maybe it's because my statistics are lower. Or maybe it's because I slowly am starting to resent and despise the customers that I service. I look at people outside of work and wonder what type of customer they would be on the phone. I stereotype them. \n\nI despise the fact that information is not clear from the company I work for, and I have to use my 'intuition' to figure out the best response. I despise the fact that the company can have arbitrary reasons for some of their actions. \n\nI do not want to hate humanity. I also do not want to be weak and leave just because things are getting hard for a little bit. It's funny because people think it's just a 'call-center' where we just sit on the phones and converse with people. \n\nThis job isn't lucrative, but it pays well. That makes it a trap. I wonder how other employees have worked there for years. The average time-frame I would say is 1.5-2 years. Typically it averages to that because a few stay for 3+ years, while the majority leave within a year. \n\nI do not want to feel like an entitled millennial who wants to leave because things are 'hard'. I just don't know. Which is why I'm here. \n\ntdlr; I feel I am a great worker that can contribute positively to a team. Yet, the company makes me wretch. The customers make me wretch. I am starting to not look at human beings the same. Like many others, I was naive about humans. I thought most people were good, but it has showed me that most people are heavily flawed, and the good ones (customers) get taken advantage of. I want to leave. Am I a weak-minded millennial? Turn-over rate is high there, but many people stay 1+years. Are they the strong ones?",

They should give everyone over the age of 70 one of those Life alert button necklaces for free.\n\nI work 411 directory assistance, which until a month ago I didn't even know still existed. It is 99% old people. And for some reason every day we get tons of calls of people who SHOULD have dialed 911. We ask \"are you able to hang up and call 911\" and usually they say \"oh yeah\" and do that.\n\nBut these two women said they could not. Or that they did but it wasn't working or no one answered. Which, tbh, is very plausible these days as scary as it is.\n\nSo one time I had to get them on the line with their local emergency dispatch after trying to get her to calm down long enough to give us so much as an address for EMS to get to. \n\nThe other time, the lady was in an assisted living place and had fallen too far from her nurse call button. She had been calling for help but no one came. We got the name of her facility and my supervisor called the place and we were transferred to the floor the woman lived on. No answer. Which is... appalling, tbh. \n\nWe even offered to call the police or EMS since they'd have to go through SOMEBODY on staff right? But the woman kept refusing. We finally got someone to go up there and help this poor woman but it took 20 minutes from the time I answered the call. ",

        "text": "I just discovered this sub and have a couple stories I'll probably share at some point, but here we go to start...\n\nJust some context. I work as an inside sales associate for a solar company. We receive leads from lead sources and receive requests for information about solar. I handle these request by both calling customers and taking calls from customers. My job is to make sure that they are qualified candidates, and then set up appointments with our outside sales consultants.\n\nWe received a warm transfer from one of our lead sources and I took the call. I gave him the usual spiel, asking if he had any questions about solar or if he was just looking to receive a free quote.\n\nHim: “Yeah, I want a quote, but I don’t want to give you any information over the phone.”\n\nMe, a little hesitant, “Okay, that’s fine, I just need your name and email and we can correspond that way.”\n\nHim: “I just told you I don’t want to give you any information over the phone.”\n\nMe: “Sir, I won’t be able to help you unless you can at least give me your email.”\n\nHe let out an exasperated sigh and gave me his email address.\n\nMe: “Alright! I’ll send you an email right now and we’ll work to get you set up with that quote.”\n\nSo I got off the phone and manage to find the lead we received attached to the number he used, and his email. This made things easier too as it provided me with his name and address. This already all felt a little weird.\n\nI sent him an email asking for his name and address, just to confirm the information I already had, and he responds with all the same information except he gives me a different address than the one our lead source provided us with. So I search the new address to see if there are any other leads pull up in our database, and a woman’s name shows up. She has the same phone number as the man I just spoke with, and the same address as the one he just provided me with- but different last names. More alarms are going off in my head.\n\nOne of the things we always check is our customer’s credit score to make sure that they qualify. It’s a soft pull so it doesn’t show on any credit reports. It’s protocol to pull it before setting appointments, as it is a big factor in knowing whether or not someone qualifies. I first pull it using the original address the lead source gave us - nothing pulls. So I then pull it using the address he gave me. His status comes up as *Not Scored: Deceased* and I lost it. I just started laughing hysterically, my eyes tearing up. It had been a long day, I was exhausted, and this was just so absurd to me at that moment. He couldn’t possibly be dead! I was just on the phone with him!\n\nI had the attention of two of my co-workers now, one of them who looked at my screen and realized why I was laughing, and the other was just confused. I explained to her what had happened and she said, horrified, “the first time that happened to me I almost cried!” I couldn’t help it. It was just so ridiculous. After a minute I was able to collect myself. I immediately sent an email to one of my supervisors reporting it as plausible fraud and flagged his account. I never heard back from him again.",

Our current call segments include us calling prospective students and asking them some basic questions about what they would like to study in college and whether they would like more information about this particular college. This is incredibly important to note.\n\nI've only been working at this call center for about 5 days, with today being only my 4th day of calling myself. As such, I'm not super comfortable with calling as everyone else here is, but I've got my greeting down pat etc. We cycle through calls pretty quickly as we mostly get answering machines. Another thing to note is that there are some answering machines that sound like a real person talking.\n\nSo I cycle through, and my computer auto calls a number for a prospective student who I'll refer to as Morgan, to protect the student's privacy. The call goes through, and it rings a few times before it sounds like someone picks up and answers the phone. I'll refer to the mysterious masculine voice as MV from here on out, and I will be Me.\n\n&gt;Me: Hi, I'm calling from \\[university\\] in \\[city\\]. Is Morgan there?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MV: Hello. Yes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Okay.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MV: Hello? Yes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Hi, *&lt;thinking that he hadn't heard me&gt;* I'm calling from \\[university\\] in \\[city\\]. Is Morgan there?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MV: Hello. Yes. I just need to take something out of the microwave.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Okay, I can wait.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MV: Do you know anything about water pressure or sprinkler systems? Is your company selling anything like that?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: No, as I said, I'm calling from \\[university\\] in \\[city\\]. I'm calling to ask if Morgan would like additional information about our school.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MV: The garage door is opening. Was that you?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: *&lt;dumbfounded&gt;* What?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MV: No. Did you open the garage?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: No, I'm just calling from \\[university\\] in \\[city\\] for Morgan.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;MV: *&lt;something inaudible&gt;*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Uh... I'm calling from \\[university\\] in \\[city\\]. Is Morgan there?\n\nAt this point, I figure that I've been duped because the mysterious voice doesn't answer, and I wasn't sure whether it was a real person I was talking to or one of those weird answering machines that sounds like a real person. I chocked it up to an answering machine and coded it as such. I know that seems rude, but I honestly wasn't getting anywhere with what was going on, and we're told to code it as such if we think that it's an answering machine.\n\nHas anyone else had a weird experience like that when calling off a list? If so, what happened, and how did you react?",

The worst technical issues and also the people who call repeatedly for no reason.\n\nOur average handle time is about 30 min per call and I’m treated like a god by my manager because I average about 15 min a call.\n\nSo recently an elderly lady called me with a nearly impossible to fix issue with our backend systems. I had to call and chat about 20 other departments to get this issue resolved.\n\nShe was a spicy elderly lady, full of funny stories. We were on this call for about 2 hours since I had to reach out to just about every department in the company.\n\nAnyway, she tells me that she used to be a long distance operator for the bell systems in the 1950s and 60s. Apparently she worked in a room with hundreds and hundreds of other women in a center that was open 24/7. Only women were hired to be operators back then.\n\nShe said she worked the late night shift a lot and there was one gentleman who called every night while masturbating. Identified himself as a retired army colonel. Did this for years. She said management couldn’t/wouldn’t do anything. Maybe it wasn’t illegal to jack off on the phone then idk but it was such a regular occurrence that ppl there got used to it and expected his calls.\n\nAfter years of this the calls stopped suddenly.\n\nOne night an elderly lady called the operators and said “I just wanted to let you girls know that the Colonel passed away a few days ago and so he won’t be bothering you anymore. I’m sry for what he did.”\n\nMy customer said she didn’t know what was weirder: the fact that the colonel did this habitually or that his wife knew about it and had enough of a conscience to let the operators know he had died and to apologize.\n\n....millions of stories, I have....\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Ok I'll have to summarize this because this was a LONG call. I work for a cell phone carrier, and not a cheap one. Basically, I'm a support coach, which means I'm mostly answering questions for newbies and giving them advice, but sometimes I have to take sup calls and pretend to be a sup because we don't have enough sups right now (or ever). \n\nA woman called in and immediately asked for a sup. The agent did what she was supposed to, which is try to figure out what was going on and deescalate if she could before getting me involved, but it just made her madder.\n\nSo she just kept ranting and being angry about not getting a sup until I took the headset from the agent because I don't have my own phone.\n\nMe: Hello, my name is Joshua, I'm a supervisor on the floor for (company). I understand you were asking to speak to a supervisor?\n\nCaller: Yes, I have been ASKING and ASKING but this agent REFUSED to transfer me, she kept asking me what was going on, though I've already talked to seven agents and I don't want to speak to anymore agents because none of them can help. I've never had such bad customer service.\n\nMe: I'm very sorry this has gone on so long, I can assure you the previous agent was just following our procedures when someone asks for a supervisor. How may I help you today?\n\nCaller: Well I have these charges on my May bill and I don't know what they're for and I didn't make them and I won't pay them.\n\nMe: Oh, no, I'm sorry about that, I'll be happy to see what's going on and get it resolved for you.\n\nI pull up the bill. She maxed out the month on carrier charges, purchases from the Google Play store that were charged to her cell account. You can make up to $100 a month. After we go through it together she admitted some of the charges were legit but about $92 of it were to the app \"Choices\", a game, that she claims she's never even heard of. After a while I put her on hold and get a sup to credit the $92 to her, mainly because she's called 8 times, and that app is kind of sketchy. \n\nShe thanks me, and calls me ma'am, but I let it slide. My voice is on the high end, and I know a lot of male collegues who get called ma'am a lot. It happens.\n\nThen we spend about 15 minutes taking about the remaining balance on her account. After the credit, she still owes us $380. I patiently explain that she hasn't paid the remainder of the May bill, the June bill, or the July bill, though that's not due yet. \n\nShe is upset because she knows she made a payment in May, but that went towards the April bill. She gets angry thinking I'm saying she paid that bill late. I try to explain patiently that the April bill wasn't due until May 23rd, it's just the April bill because it generated in April. She IS NOT getting it, and repeatedly insists that she paid the May bill. She also tries to say I accused her of not paying the April bill, which I very definitely didn't do.\n\nAnyway, I'm trying to stay patient but eventually even I get flustered, so after the 7th time she called me ma'am I reply \"I'm not a ma'am.\" \n\n\"If you're not a ma'am, what are you?\"\n\nI am not even sure how to take this, I'm mildly shocked she said it. I don't exactly take it as her being aware of non-binary identities though, to say the least.\n\nAnyway, I try to stear the conversation back to going through the bill, when she eventually gives up and asks for MY manager. At all the call centers I've worked we're not supposed to get someone else, though, we're the supervisor, even if we're not really, we're supposed to handle it. So I tell her there's no one else available. Which is pretty much true anyway.\n\nShe asks for my last name and operator number. I don't HAVE an operator number (I work for an outsourced company, not directly for the cell provider, and we don't have them.) And there's no way in hell I'm giving her my last name. Plus, my last name is sort of weird and people think it's fake when I make dinner reservations and stuff so she is NOT getting it.\n\nShe gets really suspicious that I won't give her this info, because she's \"worked for a call center before\" and \"knows how these things work\". She wants my direct extension, I don't have one. But other people from my company have them. But they are not outsourced, but I'm not going to tell her that. She wants my location, I'm definitely not supposed to tell her that.\n\nShe then has decided I'm not really a supervisor (which hey I'm not) and starts screaming at me to send an email to my actual supervisor to call her back. I'm not about to tell her I don't have email. I'm really loving my job right now, I'll tell you that.\n\nShe starts being really abusive, saying she's going to go on social media and tell everyone about this so they'll know I'm pretending to be a sup and the higher ups will listen to the call. I tell her good, they'll know I tried to help her and she wouldn't listen and that I did nothing wrong.\n\nShe keeps screaming how awful I was, and that she KNOWS I'm a chick pretending to be a dude, and I'm trying to figure out how to rescind that $92 credit I gave her (I couldn't), and eventually I transferred her to an actual sup, mainly so she couldn't leave a survey for the call, which wouldn't have gone to be anyway, but to the original agent, who's been listening in the whole time.\n\nThe sup who took the call from me talks to her for 10 minutes, repeats everything I said, and then afterwards assures me I did nothing wrong.\n\nI love getting to pretend to be a sup but still making the same amount of money as an agent....",

        "text": "The call center I work in happens to be for a company in computer software, and we are a small department at the main headquarters, simply because we have kind of a niche software and don’t need a separate location to manage the support teams. A lot of what I do involves talking to ITs for businesses, but I’m cross-trained in about 14 different applications, so my calls can vary greatly depending on the subject. One could be for a software install, another could be assisting someone find payments they received, and another could be how to explain to someone how to open a browser and type in a web address and then login to that site. \n\nThis was the worst call I’ve ever received in my nearly two years with this company. It came from an IT who decided that they wanted to spend the entire call just being a terrible person. \n\nMe: “customer support, this is ‘x’.”\n\nIT: “What if I don’t want you to record my phone calls?”\n\nMe: “I’m sorry, is there something I can assist you with today?”\n\nIT: “Yeah, you can tell me why calls may be recorded if I call in. If I want to use your product and need help, I shouldn’t have to wonder if the call is being recorded if I don’t want them to be.”\n\nMe: “I’m sorry, I’m not in charge of deciding which calls are recorded and which aren’t, I’m just here to help. Do you actually need help today or is that all?”\n\nIT: “No, I need you to remote into this PC and install this software. I just don’t like that you can record calls and I can’t tell you not to do that.”\n\nMe: “I’m sorry you disagree but that’s the company policy. I don’t make the rules, I just help with the products.”\n\n-They go round this same dialogue with me for another two minutes or so and then switch gears- \n\nIT: “Okay, so are you going to transfer me to a man who can help me then or are you going to do this for me?” \n\n(I’m a female so that line had my blood boiling.)\n\nMe: “Sir, I am trying to help you, but you haven’t let me remote in. And also, I work remotely, so I don’t even know if they can record my calls, okay?”\n\nIT: “Okay, I should probably stop ‘messing’ with you because you probably don’t think this is as funny as I do, since I have a ‘sarcastic’ sense of humor.”\n\n\nAs I’m nearly finished, this final exchange happens:\n\nIT: “Oh hey, I was on a plane ride with the owner of your company once, what was their name again?”\n\nMe: “Uhhh, do you remember their position with the company?” (We don’t have a single person as our owner, as we are owned by several large corps.)\n\nIT: “Yeah, your OWNER. Do you not know the name of your own company’s owner?”\n\nMe: “Well, seeing as I don’t get to sit down with the ceo and other higher ups, I don’t always remember their names.” (I figured trying to explain the ownership situation was pointless.”\n\nIT: “So you don’t even know the name of your owner? What kind of an employee are you? Do you even like your job or care about it?”\n\nMe: “Sorry I don’t remember the name of every higher position in the company. Your program is installed, was there anything else you needed today?”\n\nIT: “No, that was everything, bye.”\n\nI ended the call and immediately went into an unavailable status, as the guy was so immediately abrasive and aggressive, and kept piling it on the entire call, that I was holding back tears by the end of it. I consider myself a tougher person, as I handled wireless sales and tech support at a store for two years for one of my jobs, and was screamed at yet still smiled, more times than I care to remember there. \n\nThe blatant sexism and excusing their rudeness as “sarcasm” left me furious. This was the first time I’ve ever told a superior about feeling harassed at this job. I gave them their name, cell phone they called in on, and the name of the business they called for, so we could monitor if they call back. \n\nMy manager took it upon themselves to call this person back directly and basically say that they would be banned from calling in again if they harassed us in this way in the future. The guy went from super sarcastic and aggressive with them, to suddenly tucking tail and asking for my work email so that they could send me an apology note, because I have always provided great support the other times they’ve called in. (This person was a repeat caller for businesses, and was never pleasant, but had never been this crazy until now.)\n\nLong story short, they emailed me to “apologize”, and once again cited their sarcastic sense of humor as something that others don’t always “understand”.  \n\nYou’re not sarcastic, you’re just an asshole. \n\n",

My first iPhone release was the 4s in October 2011, the day after Steve Jobs passed away. We got unlimited overtime on the day we could take pre orders and basically 9.5 out of every 10 calls were about the iPhone. \n\nI dont know what it is about the iPhone that brings out the worst on people. Some highlights from that day include people trying  to upgrade to the iPhone a month after they had already upgraded. A customer complaining about us not caring for their loyal customers (His account had been open for 2 or 3 months) people cussing me out because they were not eligible for upgrade or because we could not give them the phone for free. My favorite customer though was a lady that was eligible for an upgrade. \n\nMe; Ok ma'am it does look like you are eligible for an upgrade, no the phone gets released on random day, but we can order it for you now.\n\nLady: You know I'm just glad that Steve Jobs created such a wonderful tool for us to use. In his honor I think we should be able to get the device discounted, as I think he would want us to be able to enjoy his invention.\n\nMe;  Wa...wha... huh? I'm sorry?\n\nLady: I just think that the phone should be discounted for us that would like to honor Steve Jobs.\n\nMe: We cannot change the prices on these phones.\n\nLady: That's not fair.\n\nMe: Sorry ma'am I can process an order and you'll get.....\n\nLady: Let me speak to your supervisor.\n\nOur supervisors were swamped that day.

        "text": "So it isnt often that a call center has to call another call center, (sometimes I wish we had a code to let them know we know what we are talking about) but we had to call Mediacom on behalf of a remote office we did IT support for long story short: their tech arrived, said the problem was outside the building and he would have to send other technicians. He never sent anyone else.\n\nFFW a week and the lady that runs the remote office is furious they haven't had internet for a week. I call mediacom back, they try to walk me through the troubleshooting steps, I try to explain this isnt about that and troubleshooting a system we troubleshot last week makes no difference, I humor them and have to loop the remote office into the call to get them to follow the steps. Now...heres where the breakdown occurs, our phones are from the late 90s so when you merge a call into a new one you \"transfer\" it to an open line and dial the third person. I tell them I'm going to loop the office in and it is going to put them on hold he says it's fine, I hit transfer and dial, while it is ringing the other call center guy hangs up and the dead tone is ringing in both mine and the other lady's ear. I tell her I'll call back in a second. \n\nI give him the benefit of the doubt that our phones are old or maybe his line dropped idk, things like this happen. \n\nI call mediacom back, go through the robot, it resets our still dead router, I spam 0 and say representative as I usually do to get connected. I explain the situation, he asks to speak to the on site personnel (furious lady) so I start the transfer again, connect everyone and he tells her, after sounding very understanding with me, that the robot just reset our modem and it would take 5 minutes to come back up and then promptly hangs up. I have to spend a minute explaining what he meant to the lady and that I would try again. \n\nI am a bit annoyed but resolute in getting this ticket closed. \n\nCall mediacom, try to get a rep before the robot resets the modem again, (turns out you cant if you call the customer service line about an internet issue) get to a rep, explain everything, try to tell them troubleshooting isnt even what I need to talk about, they say it is required before they move forward, I allow it because i know how it is. I loop the lady in and as soon as everyone is connected his line drops. \n\nOut of frustration I leveled with the furious lady and said I was pretty over them too. I then gave her their account information and told her if she wants to chew their ear off she is more than welcome. Normally we try to stay between the techs and the users but this time was different, she was capable and familiar with the system enough that I wasnt worried about how she would handle it and generally I think she was thrilled to be the point of contact instead of having to go through us first.

        "text": "I used to work for a hospital billing/collections company. An automatic outbound call went out for me to collect on a past due balance for a lady. When she answered, I introduced myself, told her about her balance, and tried to collect on it. This is what happened: \n\nMe: Hi, I’m calling from Hospital in regards to your balance of $158 from a date of service. Are you able to pay that today?\n\nLady: I already paid that.\n\nMe: Hmmm....I’m sorry, but I don’t have any record of your payment. How did you pay?\n\nLady: I mailed a check like a month ago.\n\nMe: Okay....hmm...I’m sorry again, but I’m looking through your account and I don’t have any indication that we received a check from you.\n\nLady: Well you cashed the check! \n\nMe: Oh my! Okay, well, do you recall the address you sent the check to? \n\nLady: Yeah I sent it to 123 Dumbass Lane.\n\nMe: (knowing that isn’t our address, I google it) Ma’am, that’s not our billing address. As I’m looking this up on Google, it looks like that address is for a different doctors office. It’s for Dr. Noname. \n\nLady: Thats a specialist I see, but it couldn’t have been them that I sent the check to because the check is cashed. \n\nMe: Well perhaps, since you sent the check to Dr. Noname, then their office was the one that cashed it.\n\nLady: So you’re telling me that I owed exactly $158 to you AND Dr. Noname?\n\nMe: No....I don’t know how much money you owe at Dr. Noname’s office.\n\nLady: Okay well the only way they would have cashed it is if I owed them $158, too, don’t ya think? I just find it strange that you’d think I’d owe the same very specific amount of money to two separate offices.\n\nMe: Well, it’s possible that you owe more than $158 to Dr. Noname and they cashed your check as payment toward your overall balance. I’m not exactly sure, to be honest. But I do know that you did not send your check here, so we could not have possibly cashed your check.\n\nLady: I don’t think you know what you’re talking about. I can’t believe you’re trying to say that I would owe exactly $158 to two different people at the same time. That’s ridiculous. You know what? If Dr Noname’s office cashed my check, then you need to call them and tell them the money belongs to you and get them to send it to you.\n\nMe: No, ma’am. That is your responsibility.\n\nLady: I can’t believe you’re telling me it’s my responsibility! I AM THE CUSTOMER!\n\nMe: I cannot call another business and demand that they send us money. \n\nLady: I’m not dealing with this anymore. I guess you won’t be getting paid then.\n\n*Click*\n\nCAN ANYONE TELL ME ON WHAT PLANET HER LOGIC MAKES SENSE? If you accidentally sent your internet provider your rent money, are you going to tell your landlord to call your internet provider and get the money from them?! ",

        "text": "Prepare for an outpouring of spite and resentment.\n\n\n\nI don't you what Americans call this breed of person, the cheeky chappie. What I'm describing is the guy who thinks that being an arsehole makes them a bit special, a bit edgy. They can get away with stuff because, as their mothers will have inevitably said at some point 'He's been in a bit of trouble but he's a good lad really'- 'a bit of trouble' here meaning anything from pinching sweets from the newsagents to armed robbery. The kind of man that will openly mock someone and then laugh hugely, sincerely believing that because *they* laughed, that makes it a joke. He's very proud of 'telling it like it is', which is a gossamer-thin excuse for rudeness. And last of all, he will lie, lie his little head off with no shame at getting caught out if they think it's to his advantage.\n\n\n\nThey come in a number of varieties- this was a guy from Manchester, 45-55 by his voice. Now I'm not going to type out the dialogue as I don't think the words alone will convey my point, or why he made me so uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nHe came on blaring about how he's a loyal customer and his family had been with us for years. I checked- it was ten months. We don't do loyalty bonuses anyway so I was spared that awkwardness but still, come on.\n\n\n\nWhat he was saying had too much gloss, it was patter- like he was auditioning for a job at a small county radio station. He was trying way too hard to give off a 'hey, I'm a good guy' vibe. He kept asking for my name, but only referred to me as 'love' for some reason.\n\n\n\nHis issue was that his contract was coming to an end, and he was expecting 'a nice likkle discount' on a new one. He claimed we'd promised him a certain deal before- we hadn't- and when I gave him the quote he told me, didn't ask, told me that I could do better. I said no, but he wanted his 'likkle discount', wheedling and threatening at the same time.\n\n\n\nI explained that (due to some really shabby and unscrupulous practices, there was a bit of a scandal a few years ago) the energy industry was heavily regulated so we can't offer special deals. He chuntered on about that a bit, and then said- I will quote this bit-\n\n\n\n*couldn't have sounded more devastated if he was being forced to watch his firstborn being stung to death by bees* 'Well, I mean... yeah. I don't want to leave, I mean I've been with you for these many years now *no you haven't, you dick* but I can't really see a way round it, I'll... I'll have to find another supplier'\n\n\n\n*DRAMATIC PAUSE*\n\n\n\n*which I allow to continue for a slightly uncomfortable amount of time*\n\n\n\nThen I explain, with the most sincere amount of giving a shit I can muster, that due to the aforementioned regulations I cannot try to persuade him to stay with my company, financially or otherwise. Fantastic, I thought, he'll bugger off now.\n\n\n\nBut no, after more cogitation and thinking noises he decides that he'll take what I can offer. Funny that, considering all the hundreds of cheaper options that were a mere click away... And this is the part of the call that made me suspicious of him.\n\n\n\nI'm sure everyone has felt like a customer is trying to trap them. You don't know quite what they want, but they keep asking you to confirm again and again seemingly unimportant details, repeating things back to you using slightly different words so you have to go back over it in your head to check that yes, that's what you meant.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, we've all had customers that need all the details of the details to satisfy their internal logic and allow them to have confidence in your service. This guy wasn't like that.\n\n\nHe was a master. He asked me about the new contract, and I explained the terms. He claimed to have no idea how it was all worked out but was zipping through the bills online very quickly so why he was pretending that I don't know. I realised early into the call what was going so, although generally I'm not a script person, I stuck to the thing word for word. Every other sentence ended with 'is that right love?' or 'so you're guaranteeing xyz are you love, is that what you're telling me?', 'so are you absolutely telling me now xyz love, can you promise me that?' or 'so you're saying here and now that xyz, you're committing to that?' And I had to tiptoe back through the language he'd used to see where it differed to what I'd actually said, and explain again.\n\n\n\nOn and on it went, until eventually he was done with me, he'd had his fun. I still don't know what his aim was. People can be rude to me all day long, but what I really hate is being manipulated. I honestly felt slightly dirty when I came off the phone. And he took me 20 minutes into my break. The worst sin.\n\n\n",

Just for reference, his mentally capacity  is that of a 10 year old. We are also having phone troubles in 2 of our locations as there is a fire in the area and it burnt down a cell tower making call quality hot garbage for cells and land lines, this is important. This client is also a frequent flier and a few months ago was calling 20 - 30 times a day because he was upset his sister was living with him.   \n\n\nMe: Mental health Facility this is Despite\\_Snow\n\nClient: Hi this is Name and I- (Quality dropped and I could hardly hear the client, just getting bits and pieces)\n\nMe: I cant hear you at all can you repeat what you said?\n\nClient: (Bits and pieces)\n\nMe: Okay, I cant hear you at all. I'm going to hang up I want you to call right back to see if that fixes the phone. (wait a few seconds no response that I could hear) Okay I'm hanging up now (end call)\n\nI got another phone call before he was able to call back in, but I saw his number pop up on caller ID and my coworker got him. She couldn't hear him at all either and told him the same thing; that shes going to hang up and he needs to call right back. About 10 minutes go by with no incoming calls and he finally calls back\n\nMe: Mental Health Facility this is Despite\\_Snow\n\nClient: Can you hear me?\n\nMe: Yup, I can hear you now\n\nClient: Its about time!  \n\n\nMe: (Alright this is gonna be an issue I can tell) So what can I do ya for\n\nClient: I need to check when my appointment is\n\nGot him all squared away with is appointment and at the end of the call the client asked me why we kept hanging up on him. I did my best to explain to him that the fire is causing issues with the phones and we couldn't hear him. He tried to interrupt half way through but I just barreled through because knowing this client he would continuously interrupt and I would never get done explaining the whole fire situation.  \n\n\nClient: Well okay but if you hang up on me one more time were gonna have problems!  \n\n\nI honestly didn't know how to reply so I just said \"Okay\"  \n\n\nClient: Ugh! I want to talk to your supervisor! I want to file a complaint!   \n\n\nMe: Okay. Hold on one second.   \n\n\nI got him over to my supervisor to file his complaint and she called me a few hours after to get my side. She told me nothing was going to happen and it was being filed as unfounded but she needed my side for documentation. Oh and bonus, we are required to send out a letter when someone files a complaint so they know where it went and what happened. Today he called in upset that we had sent him a letter and he didn't know why. I asked him who sent out the letter and he read the whole letter to me. At the end I asked him if it was our HR representative \"Jill\" (Not her real name) who sent it and he said no and wanted to spell the name out for me it was \"J-I-L-L\" and I told him \"Okay, yup that is Jill and Ill get you right over there\"",

We notified them a few times and we even have a little message that pops up online that tells them so I mentioned it at the end of the call to be nice and bring their attention to it. That was my mistake.\n\n\nThis call came in around lunch:\n\n\nMe: Sh605 speaking, what can I do for you?\n\n\nCaller: I need to talk to someone about payments.\n\n\nMe: That’s me, what’s going on?\n\n\nC: I called last week and was told you were invoicing the client and it’s your biggest client, they said this company owes over a million dollars!\n\n\nMe: *trying not to laugh at obvious bs* Ok, when was the invoice sent? Who is it for?\n\n\nC: What, you don’t know who your biggest client is?\n\n\nMe: We have several very large clients, but even if I knew who I still need the invoice date.\n\n\nC: You’re just bullshiting me, you’re saying you can’t look in your own system??\n\n\nMe: That’s not what I said. I’m not a mind reader, I need names and dates so I know where to start. \n\n\nCaller 2: *suddenly speaks up* Uh hi this is C2 and I believe this is actually in reference to a tax issue.\n\n\nMe: *pulls account* Oh yeah, I spoke to you this morning, C2. We just need some information updated to release those payments. We can do it right now.\n\n\nCaller 1(the first guy on this call): Ok, let’s do that.\n\n\nWe spend a surprisingly pleasant few minutes updating the info and going over how to resubmit things that the business failed to process online in time. Then things went downhill again when he asked when we would release the withheld payments.\n\n\nMe: Well, we have to verify this, and then they would be released. I can’t give a definite date but I expect over the next week or so to be safe.\n\n\nC1: That’s ridiculous! We are a small business and we can’t hang on to a balance due this large. We are not doing business with you unless you pay this tomorrow.\n\n\nMe: With all due respect, you didn’t notice this until I told C2 as a courtesy this morning. This doesn’t just happen we asked for this information for months before we started withholding payment. I think some time to verify and send the payments out is not asking too much.\n\n\nC1: I CALLED LAST WEEK AND NO ONE TOLD ME THEY SAID YOUR CLIENT OWES A MILLION DOLLARS\n\n\nMe: That sounds like you were calling on something specific, they may not have thought to check on that I you were just asking about a recent invoice for one company.\n\n\nC1: DON’T REWRITE THE BOOK I’M THE DAMN AUTHOR I HOPE THAT MAKES THINGS CLEAR!\n\n\nMe: What?\n\n\nC1: YOU HAD BETTER SEND THIS OUT TOMORROW OR-\n\n\nMe: Don’t threaten me. We will send them out when we verify what you gave us is correct. \n\n\nC1: YOU HAD FUCKING BETTER OR-\n\n\nMe: If you keep talking to me like this I will end the call. I have been respectful to you and I expect the same in return.\n\n\nC1: IF YOU HANG UP...\n\n\nMe:...\n\n\nC1:...\n\n\nMe: Go ahead, this is a recorded line. If I hang up what?\n\n\nC1: I expect this payment by the end of the day tomorrow.\n\n\nMe: Sir, again, we need time to verify the information and send the payments. It will not be tomorrow and I’m asking you to honor your contract while we sort this out.\n\n\nC1: No I will not and you WILL pay me tomorrow!\n\n\nMe: We will pay you when we verify the information you gave us is correct. I will let the contracts department know of the situation so when they get reports about your business they will know what’s going on. They might have questions so you could get a call from them. \n\n\nC1: GO AHEAD, REPORT ME, I HAVE A GREAT LEGAL TEAM!!! YOU HEAR THAT C2?? NO CUSTOMERS FROM (my business)!!\n\n\nC2: *sigh* Yes...\n\n\nMe: Ok well is there anything else-\n\n\nC1: Go fuck yourself *click*\n\n\nI am praying they cancel this guy.",

They were referring to our entertainment.  This caller in particular just happened to luck into his cousin answering the call.  Cold caller with no caller ID - recognized solely by voice, his first name, and birth date.  Of course being his cousin, he knows all the family dirt.\n\nSo thus begins the hijinks.  The said cousin's mother died when he was young, so of course my husband told him that C's mom would be very disappointed with him. And proceeded to tell him how his mom died in an accident.  He then threw out the he should have used the inheritance for school, not buying a rc car track that went under in less than 6 months.  Referred to the fact that he hadn't spoken to anyone in the family for over a year.

I've had some interesting calls in the roughly six months I've been working here, and one I just had today was no different...\n\nI am 'M', caller is 'C'.\n\nM: Thank you for calling [TRICARE Contractor here], my name is Michinoku1, how can I help you?\n\nC: Yes, I'm trying to find out what's going on with my account - I just got a bill in the mail, and it's saying TRICARE isn't covering because I show some other form of health insurance, but that's wrong - I don't have any other health insurance.\n\nA look over her account shows indeed a flag for \"OHI\" - TRICARE works as secondary if a beneficiary has OHI.  In this case, a further check of her account shows the flag is active, but no OHI is listed... so something needs to be cleared out.\n\nM: Okay ma'am, so I do show that the system says you have OHI, but I don't see any OHI plans on file with us.  I'm guessing there was something that was missed when it was removed originally, so I'm going to need to get you over to the Claims department to have that removed.\n\nC: Ugh, I'm going to have to be transferred again?  Because I just got done talking to [Co-Worker's name here], and he said the exact same thing.  This is the third time this has happened!\n\nM: I understand, ma'am, but I unfortunately can't remove the flag myself, or I would - that's something the claims department handles.  I can get you over there and they can take care of the issue.\n\nC: Well, I would like to speak to a supervisor.\n\nM: Okay ma'am, but like I said, I'd need to get you to the Claims department, since they're the ones that handle that.  I would get in trouble if I was to just straight transfer you to an Escalations representative.\n\nC: Whatever, just get me to the Claims department and a supervisor there (something I can't do; I have to transfer them to the department and THEN the reps there can transfer to a supervisor).  This is the third time I've been told this, that I'd need to speak to someone in Claims, and I can't keep doing this!  I keep getting the run-around, I don't have a job, I'm supposed to be at an interview, I just got a $7,500 bill, and I'm so frustrated that I'm going to take this all the way to my senator!\n\nA quick check of the \"Recent Interactions\" tab in our call software shows that she hasn't called us since February, and it wasn't over her account showing OHI.  Also, is it my fault she doesn't have a job?  I digress.\n\nM: Okay ma'am, I'm going to go ahead and notate a few things down and get you over to the Claims department.\n\nI did a few quick notations in the call tracking software and quietly transferred her over.

(I've shortened this slightly.) \n\nFor non-Americans, Obamaphones are free crappy phones you can get from the government that are for poor people.\n\nThis literally happened 3 hours ago.\n\n\n\nCust: i need $100 yr again\n\nMe: Hello, my name is Josh. Thank you for contacting (carrier). I will be happy to assist you with your account. To begin with, may I have your phone number?\n\nCust: XXX-XXX-XXXX.\n\nMe: Oh, I'm very sorry, this is a prepaid account. You will need to reach out to our prepaid department, their number is XXX-XXX-XXXX.\n\nCust: my phone suspended. I can't pay anything until Sept. \n\nMe: Oh, no! I'm sorry to hear about your phone being suspended. You can always still call into customer service on a suspended phone. Prepaid can help you with making arrangements.\n\nCust: I need $100/yr plan again.\n\nMe: I'm very sorry, you will need to talk to prepaid about any plan changes. I'm looking on their website, here, and I'm showing their cheapest plan is $30 a month.\n\nCust: you're not helping.\n\nMe: I can understand being frustrated if you're not speaking to the correct department. Unfortunately, I am not able to access prepaid accounts.\n\n(She doesn't respond to me for several minutes, so I start non-responsing her.)\n\nMe: I haven't heard from you in a while, is everything going well?\n\nCust: NO IT'S NOT GOING WELL.\n\nMe: I'm sorry you're frustrated. I want to make sure everything gets handled for you. Please reach out to our Prepaid department so that we can assist you today. \n\nCust: i can't call in, it make me make payment.\n\nMe: Oh, no, is there another phone you could call in from?\n\nCust: im so pissed with (carrier) right now.\n\nMe: I understand you're frustrated, is there another phone you could possibly use to call in?\n\nCust: my hubby not have phone.  i can't pay anything until sept. i need $100 for yr.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, you will have to call in in order to speak about plan options with Prepaid. \n\nCust: i have landline.\n\nMe: Great! Could you please call into prepaid with your landline?\n\nCust: no if i call in ill cuss, yell, scream\n\nMe: You're going to have to call in in order to get service.\n\nCust: no if i call I cuss    yell   scream\n\nMe: You're going to have to call in.\n\n(This is where she closed chat on me.)",

A lady (AL for angry lady )had called really angry about her package being missing and was demanding a tracking number. Just to give extra context, English is not my first language and although I’m very fluent there were somethings I wasn’t quite used to, like dictating in English and the phonetic alphabet...\n\n\n- Me: ok ma’am, the number is 1...\n- AL: 1. Next \n- Me: “A” as in apple \n- AL: A as in apple, Neeext\n\nNow, the next letter was a Z, and for the love of my life I couldn’t think of a word in English with Z. \n\n- AL: are you still theeeere? I need the number!!!\n\nThis was on one of my first weeks so I was panicking about being yelled at.  I couldn’t think of ANY words that begun with Z. So I just blurted out the following:\n\n- Me: sorry ma’am, Z as in Zombie\n- AL: whaaaaaaat? How can you be so unprofessional? Zebra, Zoe, Zucchini, Zinc! ( and all sorts of words with Z) why in God’s name would you say Zombie? Just give me the rest of the number....\n\n\nThis experience was later shared in our end of the day nesting discussions and afterwards they would constantly remind us that we could type alphabet in our resources tool and we would have both the phonetic alphabet and one based on the products we sold. \n\nIt became such an inside joke that when I became an escalation agent on the week of Halloween we sent all sorts of Halloween themed info and memos. One of them was the not to be used Halloween alphabet with Zombie for the Z. ",

We worked from paper, not a computer, this was over 20 years ago. There were probably 15 of us, and two floor managers who monitored calls. One big boss in the back. \n\nIf the person wasn’t home we would mark the paper as call back in an hour, call back tomorrow, etc., then put the paper back into circulation and follow the last persons notes. \n\nOne night the two floor managers started yelling at me across the room and wouldn’t stop, when I got a little off script and I couldn’t hear the phone call because they were being so loud. Later I called a lady asking for her husband, which was the customer, and she tells me she’s already told us 5 times that night he wouldn’t be home until the next day. The paper wasn’t marked correctly so I marked it ‘don’t call back tonight’ and circled it and put stars beside it to make sure everyone would see it. \n\nI went to complain to the managers that this paper system didn’t work well and they needed a separate box for the next day, instead of lumping all call backs into the same bin to be grabbed by whomever when their stack was low. \n\nThe big boss heard me and called me in and I told him about them yelling while I was on the phone instead of correcting me after the call was over. Mentioned my frustration with the system they had. He told me if I didn’t like it I could leave and any retard could do the job. Pissed me off. Luckily this was the first day after I got paid and only worked about 4 hours a day at minimum wage. In my rage I saw his softball trophy shelf including a glove and bat. I grabbed the bat and smashed the shit out of his lamp and told him he could keep this retards pay for the day and walked out. ",

I won't go much into detail, but if you'd like to know more, you could have a read [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/8wixwx/completely_uncalled_for_rant/) or [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/8xda9s/the_lesser_of_two_evils/). This time it wasn't directly a call center concern. It was an email by a worried customer to a colleague - don't know in which department anymore - and he forwarded it (and his reply) to other departments and to us.\n\nCustomer: \"Dear..., we went on a tour with the catamaran last weekend and we had a nice ride with a light swell and we are pretty much regained now. The only thing we were wondering about were the seagulls sitting on the surface of the water we rode towards. We never saw them flying away. What happens to them? I hope they didn't die!\"\n\nColleague: \"Dear..., we are glad to hear, that you had a relaxed holiday and we will try to help clarifying what happens to the seagulls.\n\n**What you maybe didn't notice was, that all seagulls on the open sea wear a PPE, a personal protection equipment, made of tiny helmets and life vests. So if we hit them with one of the two hulls they'll be fine and just get back up to the surface.**\"\n\n(*I really loved that passage, because I imagined how stupid seagulls might look with that \"PPE\" and how they would turn back up like a roll-poly doll. But he didn't stop here.)*\n\n\"No, just kidding and we hope you don't take it amiss. Now to the real explanation: Due to the two hulls and the general higher position of the catamaran there will be no harm to seagulls, as they pass the hole. They maybe get wet or shaken a bit, but usually nothing more. And if they're about to get hit by one of the hulls the natural flight instinct kicks in and the seagulls fly away to the sides on a height where you won't see them.\n\nWe hope we were able to clear things up for you and hope to see you again.\"\n\nTL;DR: Colleague made fun of a worried customer by creating a funny fictional fact, but clears things up in the end.",

After telling him this about 4 times, he said he would make a payment on the other card for $0 so that his card information would \"pop up\". Again, not how it works.  Then I got to hear about how he was outside his house and he's an old man and it would take him awhile to get into his house to get his credit card information. This was after he started out the call by saying three previous agents hung up on him for no reason. The only way that would happen would be if he was using profanity, which I assumed by that point that he was. After finally getting his bank info and making the payment, I noticed we put a float on his payment, which meant it wouldn't be available for 2 weeks so we could do additional verification because he had had some returned payments in the past.

It is now 15:30 and I have yet to receive a call! I am I completely dissatisfied!\n\n&gt; **ME**: Ah I'm really sorry about that. Let's just do some security and we'll see what's going on.\n\n&gt; **BI**: Actually it's concerning my daughter's account so you'll probably need to do security with her.\n\nSo this dickhead lost his damn cool for for a case update on an account that wasn't his and thereby prolonged my AHT. Absolute dick! So I do security with **AC** who gives me permission to discuss her account with her father. \n\nTurns out that she had received a cheque from a \"friend\" who said that he had \"too much money\" and wanted her to put some money in her account.

It did \\*NOT\\* inform them to call **BI** and update him. That would be a massive data breach. Even if **AC** was \"only 17\"^* at the time. Back I went.\n\n&gt; **ME**: Hi there sir. Sorry for the wait. Having read through your daughters case, it looks like you asked to be rang today but it does not mention that you would be guaranteed a call. I'm sorry if you were told that you would definitely be getting a call. \n\n&gt; **BI**: ARE YOU CALLING ME A LIAR?!\n\nYes. There is no way in hell he would have been guaranteed a callback.\n\n&gt; **ME**: No sir. What I meant by that was that *even if* my colleague guaranteed that you would be getting a callback, we wouldn't be able to discuss your daughter's account with you because you are not named on this account. To discuss the account would mean blatant data breach and hefty fines reaching into the millions. We have to adhere to the Data Protection Act, or DPA.\n\n&gt; **BI**: She is ONLY 17! I have to help her handle this!! What DPA?!\n\nThen get yourself named on the account. Would've taken him two weeks.  \n\n&gt; **ME**: I'm really sorry sir, but [bank] would never ring you personally to discuss an account on which you are not named. \n\n&gt; **BI**: So either you're both lying or one of you is telling the truth. Who is telling the truth?!\n\n&gt; **ME** (bluntly): I am. And if you're still unhappy with that I can get you through to our complaints team. Everything is recorded and they'll be able to determine exactly what was agreed with yourself and my colleague.\n\nHe accepted the offer so I got him through. I later messaged the advisor in question. Yeah, turns out **BI** was lying through his teeth.\n\n---\n^* **BI**'s words.",

It needed to go into a trust name. I'm assuming she didn't understand (wasn't listening) when the rep asked her what name to put it in and she agreed to put it in hers in the interim. So, onward to my pleasant conversation with her. \n\nCUST: Yes, I got a COLLECTION notice for an account that shouldn't even be in my name. Take it out of my name right now or I'm going to sue you people. Account number is 0000000. \n\nMe: Thank you so much, I apologise for any inconvenience this has caused. Let me just take a look at the account. \n\n*The account is in her name, but it's closed. We only send closed accounts to collections.*\n\nMe: Okay ma'am, it looks like this account is already closed. You're receiving collections letters for an outstanding balance. \n\nCUST: THIS ACCOUNT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN IN MY NAME. I AM NOT PAYING AS LONG AS IT'S IN MY NAME. IT SHOULD BE IN *TRUST NAME*. FIX THIS RIGHT NOW. \n\nMe: I apologize. It looks like we were waiting on some documentation from you for verification of the trust, but we didn't receive what was needed. You'd need to send it again. \n\nCUST: I SENT YOU EVERYTHING. YOU HAVE IT ALL. CHANGE IT NOW. \n\nMe: As I explained, we don't have what we need. You need to send it again. \n\nCUST: WELL YOU CAN TALK TO MY ATTORNEY. ILL GIVE YOU HIS NUMBER AND YOU CAN CALL HIM AND HE WILL FIX THIS. IM SUING YOU PEOPLE. I WONT PAY AS LONG AS IT'S IN MY NAME. \n\nMe: If you choose not to pay, that's fine, but it will affect your credit score. I cannot call your attorney because this is an inbound call center. He can give us a call to sort this out. \n\nCUST: *literally screeching* FUUUUUCCCKKK YOUUUUUU!!!!!!! *click*\n\n\nI felt bad at first because maybe she misunderstood the process, but damn.\n\nEdit: Eventually saw that customer was from my trashy ass hometown.

I just paid you guys thousands of dollars on an *online retailer* company gift card because you told me you can lower my bill and give me that channel. \n\nMe: *sighs*. Sir, we do not offer channels free for 2 years. And we never ask you to pay with gift cards, it looks like you received a scam call.\n\nCustomer: what do you mean it was a scam? It was your phone number. You guys told me that if I paid an advance of 6 bills that you would lower my bill to $46 a month and give me channels free. I want my channels and I want my discount. You guys told me that since you are now affiliated with *online retailer* that you needed me to pay you with their gift card. \n\nMe: sir we never ask you to pay with gift cards, and scammers can mask their numbers to be any other number. I'm sorry that you got scammed but I am not able to give you what you're asking for.\n\nCustomer: *goes quiet for a few seconds* It was YOUR PHONE NUMBER. I want my channels and I want my lower bill.\n\nMe: well like I said before, I can't give you that.\n\nCustomer: well, I want some sort of compensation for this. I want my money back. You guys need to give me money since you gave them my information. \n\nMe: because this was not an error on our part, we unfortunately would not be able to provide you compensation for the scam that you fell for.\n\nCustomer: so you're telling me that you are not affiliated with *online retailer*? \n\nMe: no sir.

We wouldn’t start getting any calls until about 7:10 when they opened the transfer queue and it was usually about a call every 5-10 mins until around 8:30 or so.  Depending on the order we went ready sometimes you wouldn’t get the first call until 7:45 or so.\n\nThings were pretty lax, we’d log in and have a team meeting, but on this particular day the nice lady from our resource department (monitored call levels, approved aux time, etc) was asking us to skip our meeting and get live as soon as possible because we had thousands of calls in queue.\n\nNo one had any idea what was going on, but here were my first three calls until I figured it out.\n\nCall 1.\n\nMe: Thanks for calling how can I help?\n\nCust: Yes I am so angry at your company!\n\nMe:  Oh no! I don’t want you to be upset with us, can you explain what’s going on so that we can get this straightened out for you?\n\nCust:  You can’t fix this, my daughter is scarred for life.  Why would you show pornography on Nickelodeon????\n\nMe: Well ma’am I certainly apologize that this happened, but we don’t control the content that is on each channel, we just rebroadcast what they give us, but I know that Nickelodeon doesn’t show that kind of content.  Are you sure that’s the channel it’s on?\n\nCust:  Yes I double checked and this is completely unacceptable, how are you going to compensate for corrupting my daughter’s innocence?\n\nMe:  Well ma’am something isn’t right here, let me go verify a few things to see what’s going on and we’ll go from there.\n\nWe had a demo room right beside my seat so I went in , thinking this woman was crazy, turned it to Nickelodeon and sure enough.... porn.  I turned it off as quick as possible so someone didn’t think I was trying to be freaky at work and went back.\n\nMe:  okay thanks for holding ma’am.  I verified it and I don’t know why, but it’s showing the same thing here.\n\nCust: Right I told you so!  How are you going to compensate me?\n\nMe: Well ma’am as I had stated earlier, we don’t control the content, nor are we even allowed to modify Nickelodeon’s feed in any way, so really you’ll have to take this up with them, they are owned by a company called Viacom and Id be happy to get you their contact number\n\nSurprisingly she didn’t fight anymore and took the number to go on a crusade against Nick.\n\nWell...... then here comes call number 2\n\nMe:  Thanks for calling how can I help you?\n\nCust: Hi, I’m not really sure what’s going on, but I like to listen to the Hawaiian music channel every morning because it helps to calm me down, but well, it’s not showing Hawaiian music, it has pornography.\n\nMe: oh wow, I’m sorry about that sir, I’m not too sure why that would happen, but we’ve been having some problems with our channels and we are getting it reported to fix as soon as we can.  Give me just a moment to get some information.\n\nSo I went and verified it again, this time on a little small TV out of site and yep! It had porn too.  Now I knew it wasn’t a channel issue, but had to be something on our end.  The team chats suggested the same thing.  We worked on getting it reported and escalated up to engineering, but I told the guy and he was fine.  The third call was the best though.  This guy was very country.\n\nMe: Thanks for calling how can I help?\n\nCust: Yeah, well, this Jim down here in Abaleine, Texas (oh yeah like now I know exactly who you are) and I don’t know if anyone told y’all yet, but the terrorizers done took over y’all satteRlatts.\n\nMe:  Well Jim I appreciate you calling and sharing your concerns but we’re having some troubles with our channels and we’re working to get them fixed.  What would make you think that though?\n\nCust: well I think y’all got tooken over because I went to turn it to watch my Fox News and low and behold they had al qaeda on there.  So it looks like the terrorizers done took over y’all satteRlatts.\n\nI go back to verify what’s going on this time.....\n\nMe: Jim everything’s okay, that’s just Al Jazeera\n\nCust: Al who?\n\nMe: Al Jazeera, see what happened is somehow our channels got jumbled around and instead of turning to Fox News it turned to Al Jazeera, it’s one of our channels in a different language, you can think of it like the Fox News of the Middle East.\n\nCust: Wait so we’re not under a terrorist attack?\n\nMe: No sir everything’s okay\n\nCust:  whew that’s great so I guess I’ll get out of the bunker now, thank ya so much I was so worried.\n\nMe: no problem sir we’ll have it fixed and get your Fox news back up as soon as we can.\n\n\n\nI lost it!  Somehow all the channels just got jumbled, but what a coincidence that of all channels Al Jazeera was the one that ended up on Fox News.... priceless",

To produce accurate bills, we need regular meter readings, which either the customer can provide or a meter reader will come round and do it.\n\n\n\nWhile we are responsible for the meters themselves, we have nothing to do with the cupboards that are built around them. Generally they open with a triangular key, and these are readily available.\n\n\n\nHowever, lots of councils and social housing providers replace these cupboards en masse- they lock with standard Yale keys, but worryingly often they're not given to the householder. They will then at some point get a request for the meter readings and be unable to open their meter cupboards. They call the council, they don't have the keys. They call maintenance, they don't have the keys. They call anyone they can think of whose hands these keys might have passed through, but no luck. There's not a lot I can advise really, but today this happened-\n\n\n\nMe- 'I'm sorry, I know it's a pain, but I really can't reassess your bill without meter readings.'\n\n\n\nCust- 'This is just daft. I know it's not your fault love, it's bloody council. I didn't even ask for it in the first place.'\n\n\n\nMe- 'I'm trying to think who else might be have the keys. There'd be a big bunch of them somewhere, if they did your whole estate. How about-'\n\n\n\n*MASSIVE SPLINTERING CRASH*\n\n\n\n*a moment of stillness, and then a chuckle*\n\n\n\nCust- 'I've got that reading for you love' (gives me the numbers)\n\n\n\nMe- 'So...'\n\n\n\nCust- 'Found that key, it were on the end of my leg.'\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This will be long. FTP, on mobile and not sorry about it, hope this fits here, yada yada yada. TL;DR at the end. \n\nWhen I was a freshman in college, I worked for Institutional Relations, the department that cold calls everyone who has ever so much as spoken the name of the college to badger them for money, for almost one semester. I say almost because, while this was never a pleasant job due to the people we called getting quite angry with us, there was one particular call that I could not in good conscience continue with, but was essentially forced to. This was a small liberal arts college that did fairly well financially and had a high alumni donation rate for its size and type. \n\nEveryone knew that IR was a crap job, but it paid the best of all the work-study options and they always fed us dinner, so it was a popular choice. It never felt great to call people asking for money when most of them were either currently paying tuition or still paying off loans, but luckily most people recognized the number and just didn’t pick up the phone. There are different calling pools we got assigned to on shifts, like first-year alumni, alumni who have given before but not in the past five years, alumni who give yearly, etc. On this particular night, I was assigned to call parents of current students. It’s also important to know that we had a policy in place that we were not allowed to end the call unless we had done “The Ask” for a donation three times, though we didn’t get in trouble if we were hung up on. The script was almost identical for all calling pools: start by updating contact information, ask them questions designed to get them reminiscing about their lovely experience at the college (“build rapport”), and then once they’re nice and buttered up with nostalgia, hit them with the asks. \n\nSo far my shift had gone pretty quietly with no one really picking up or having “time to talk right now.” I saw that my next call was to the mother of a current sophomore. She answered, I opened by updating her contact information as the script said to, and then began building rapport. I asked if her daughter was enjoying her experience. The mother’s voice breaks and she says that she did, but over the last holiday her daughter had gotten in a horrible car accident and was on medical leave. It was the sort of situation where they didn’t know if she’d ever regain the ability to feed herself, let alone return to school. I put her on hold and asked my supervisor if I could end the call there because it was clearly upsetting. I also expected that the family was probably overwhelmed with medical debt and would not be in a place to donate even if I did get to the asks. The supervisor said no, that I had to do my three asks, and went over to her desk where she was able to listen in to my call and make sure I stuck to the script. She signaled to me that she was listening and I should continue. I returned to the mother and asked if her daughter had done any extracurricular activities. She said she had played a sport but would probably never be able to again. By this time she was audibly crying. The next questions were about if she had friends, what her favorite classes were, basically asking the mother to recount all of the things her daughter used to love but will probably never get to experience again. Between each question I looked pleadingly over to my supervisor, who signaled each time that I must keep going. Finally the mother told me that this call was extremely upsetting and hung up. I proceeded to quit my job. \n\nIf this had happened now, I would have ended the call anyway and said screw the consequences. I feel so awful for essentially traumatizing that woman and reminding her in excruciating detail of all the things her daughter could never do thanks to the accident. Alas, I was young and afraid of getting in trouble. So, to that woman, wherever you are, I am so incredibly sorry to have put you through that, and I will do my best to never do that to a person again, regardless of what my boss is telling me. Luckily now I work in academia, and my field of research doesn’t usually require me to even talk to people, so the chances are pretty low. \n\nTL;DR: Woman is clearly being emotionally scarred by this phone call, supervisor forces me to keep script anyway because we might get money out of her. \n\nEdit: formatting.

        "text": "This isn't so much a conversation with a specific customer, more a description of my first day as a telephone operator- domestic and emergency.\n\n\n\nI'd left school and within a month had started training at BT- who pretty much had a stranglehold on UK telecoms at the time. We all worked for 3 weeks to get accredited, and after a few hours of supervised training calls, we were off on our shifts. I was doing nights so I stayed up the previous night, and got up at...\n\n\n\n4pm, on September 11th 2001. I came downstairs and my mum had the telly on, unusual for her in the afternoon. I walked into the sitting room and was confronted by those famous images- the towers falling, firemen covered in dust, the massive swirling column of dust and paper- and I thought maybe it was a film. Although it was afternoon here, it was still 11am in New York so the news was patchy and confusing but I grasped what was happening and, having just left boarding school was thinking of people I knew who lived there.\n\n\n\nThe next couple of hours was a blur of nervousness until I presented myself at work for the start of my 7pm shift. To clarify- my duties were to handle 999 calls (finding out what service the caller wanted and passing them through), resolving connection problems, taking reverse charge calls, all that sort of thing. Sometimes stressful, but relatively straightforward.\n\n\n\nThe first thing I'm told is that 'North America is down basically, some patchy service in Canada. Oh and the switches are going crazy, you're on international overflow until it calms down'. I was not trained to take international calls, and wouldn't be for some months until I had proved my competence. It's a whole different set of standards and protocols, and I didn't know a single one of them at the time.\n\n\n\nThere followed 10 hours I was entirely unprepared for. 'North America is down' meant that due to massive demand on those circuits and actual damage done to the equipment the vast majority of calls from the UK to the US were not connecting. There are reserved lines that are protected but if you were just a normal person with a normal phone your chances of getting through were minimal. \n\n\n\nHysterical panic from people who couldn't connect with loved ones aside, there were some comments made that night I'll always remember. Some snippets-\n\n\n\n999- 'I'VE GOT PAKIS LIVING NEXT DOOR I CAN SMELL THEIR FUCKING COOKING THEY'RE THE ONES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR'\n\n\n\nInternational- *epically drunk and pretending not to be, therefore making it all the more obvious* 'I've been trying to get through to my friend in Florida for TWENTY minutes. I know there's some trouble going on (winning my understatement of the millennium award) but really, there's no excuse for this'\n\n\n\n999- 'You'll learn, fucking kaffirs. The degenerate west will fall, this will happen again and again until it does' (I had a worrying amount of these calls that night, and in the months that followed)\n\n\n\n999- 'Oh my godddddd, the Houses of Parliament/The Tower of London/random London landmark is on fiiiiirrrre, a plane hit it' *hysterical laughter*\n\n\n\nAll mixed in with what I would later realise was the general lunacy of the night shift. So you see why I called this a baptism of fire. In one night I think I realised how weird and demanding and fucked up and just totally self absorbed the general public can be. As my career in customer service has gone on- during the banking crisis in 2008 when all day every day I had people screaming at me and sometimes threatening violence- I can look back and say 'Is it as bad as your first day on this job Onion? Is it?' and I can say no, no it isn't, and that's got me through some rough times.",
