Or grow it even more, even. I know the country was already supposedly independent by then but they seem to have still had enough influence to impose some kind of land reform/redistribution even after the war, like they did with Japan…and yet I don't think they did.

Especially as equal rights of men and women was written directly into the german constitutional law in 1949.\n\nOften a section from the german civil code is quoted here, which was abolished in the family law reform of 1976, (roughly translated): \"The wife is allowed to work, if this is compatible with her duties to marriage and family\". \n\nNow how was the situation of wifes exactly who wanted to earn their own money 50 years ago? Did employers demand a written permission from their husbands? Or could a husband go to court and sue to declare his wife's work contract as void? Or was this section of the german family law just kind of \"guideline\", and more or less irrelevant if a woman really wanted to go to work?",

In the article, an archeologist mentioned that inside the city walls were the important buildings like temples, but nearly all the people actually lived outside the walls. I thought that explained how so many huge cities like Babylon have such a small area enclosed by their walls. I also always assumed that large cities must of had miles of farms and pastures to support their populations since, according to Google, even with modern farming techniques you need about 5 acres of land to support one person. So a city like Hattusa with 30,000 people must of had at least a couple hundred square miles of land dedicated to agriculture, and they still would have had to import a lot. And that's to say nothing of Babylon's 100,000+ population. But if that's true, I don't really understand how the walls functioned if most people, and presumably most of their possessions, were not only outside the walls, but not even within visual distance of them. Unless the walls were just to protect the priests, aristocracy, etc.  \n\n\nDid most people live outside the city walls, with at least some people up to several miles outside the city walls (making it impossible to outrun any attacking chariots, etc.), or am I missing something about how these cities kept themselves fed?\n\nIn case of attack, did everyone at least try to hole up behind the walls while their homes outside were ransacked (which seems to defeat the point of having walls), or were the the people in the suburbs left to their own devices?",

And by a sequence of what I call a mixture of miracles and political intelligence (he was a boy still), he gathered warriors and became powerful. And not just some warriors, but (by wit and a lack of ability to forgive), he overthrows initially all tribes in the Mongolian steppe and becomes the Khan of all Mongols.\nAnd he doesn't stop there. At all!\n\nDo you know anything in addition to the told story which explains the seemingly incredible developments, - something which is not shown in the story?\nAlso: To what extent was the conquering of the world by the Khan à là \"it just happened since he couldn't stop the battling, like in a rage\" (which is in accordance with the book)",
