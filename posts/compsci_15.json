I shared the image recognition algorithms that I came up with on this subreddit, which seemed quite popular, so I thought I'd also share the model of physics I came up with that is rooted in the same ideas.\n\nThe core concept is that elementary particles are discrete, combinatorial objects, that contain a finite amount of information (i.e., the information that describes their properties, like charge, mass, etc). I then show that if we assume that energy and information are proportional to each other, then with some technical assumptions, the model produces the same equations for time-dilation as the special and general theories of relativity. \n\nThough the subject matter of the paper is technically physics, it is really a paper on discrete mathematics, information theory, and computer theory, and so I thought it would be interesting to this crowd.\n\nLink: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323684258_A_Computational_Model_of_Time-Dilation",

Any CompSci graduates willing to suggest colleges I should look at. I really want to look at some good options but I haven’t found many that are realistic.\n\n3.  What are the differences between a CompSci major and Business majors in terms of job opportunities. I have read that CompSci majors have a higher out of college salary but does that continue to increase as you move up in the world like business does? Ex. A high level business exec could make up to 7 figures with the right job, is there any comparable computer science based positions?",

Nodes do not know what other nodes are pointing at it.  \nI want to find every node's distance to node x, so for example every node pointing directly at x has a value of 1 and every node pointing to one of those has a value of 2 and so on. It is safe to assume every node has some path to node x.   \n\nIt does not matter particularly how long it takes but obviously faster is better. Also don't worry about storing the nodes in memory or anything like that, this is more of a hypothetical problem. Also assume the task can not be parallelized, it is running on one computer. \n \nMy current solution is: \n\n    nodeX.distance &lt;- 0    \n    while there are nodes with a null distance:    \n        for each node that's distance is null:    \n            if currentNode has any connections with a non null distance:    \n                currentNode.distance &lt;- 1 +  min( currentNode.connection's distances)    \n              \nIs that a good solution?

(i.e. such that rows and columns are in ascending order).\n\nIt is clear to me that it is O(n\\^2 log n) - you can just sort all the n\\^2 numbers, use the first n as the first row, the next n as the second row, and so on.\n\nWhich leads me to the tricky part. I'm confused about how to prove that it is also Omega(n\\^2 log n). My thinking is that I should show that if this problem could be solved in o(n\\^2 log n) comparisons, it would violate the sorting lower bound, but I'm not sure how I would go about doing that.\n\nDo people have any suggestions?\n\nThank you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Very similar to this process mining field is also the field of \"Petri net synthesis\", which is a subfield of formal methods\n\nRecently I stumbled upon a research field that is called 'grammatical inference', where researchers have developed techniques to learn an automaton (for regular language) or even a CFG (for context-free languages) from example data, and some of these techniques can even learn probabilistic languages.\n\nI've noticed that all of these fields are quite focused on their own community and seem to be rather unaware of what is going on in those other related fields, and seem to be missing out on opportunities for knowledge transfer between the fields. One of the main reasons is that it is hard to find relevant articles from scientific communities other than your own, since the terminology (and therefore the required search terms) can be different. I happened to stumble up this grammar inference field purely by accident, and that made me wonder: are there any other related fields and related techniques that I am unaware of and am not finding because I am not searching for the terms that are used in their terminology? \n\nTherefore, I would be very interested, does anyone know a research field or technique for learning a language from sequence data that I did not already list?\n\nEdit: a typo",

I thought it was interesting since it's entirely deterministic, and doesn't use regression or other traditional AI techniques, but instead makes use of information theory. \n\nAn informal summary of the algorithm, underlying theory, and code, is all here:\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/project/Information-Theory-16\n\nI believe it's polynomial in operations (specifically O( N^2 )) as a function of the number of pixels in the image (N), but I confess I haven't done a thorough analysis yet. It is however (in its current form) reliant upon Octave's calculation of entropy, which I think might be a bottleneck in the algorithm.\n\nThoughts are welcome.",

That is, constraints are \"cross joined\" or \"projected\" onto each other. Just like relational databases. (Ex: Dr. Dechter describes Arc Consistency as \"Constraint Cross-joined with a Variable's Domain\". While Path-consistency is discussed as \"Constraint X cross-join Constraint Y cross-join Variable's domain\").\n\nAnyway, the book more or less assumes you're doing things with the standard Table-representation of relations. But it has a throwaway line about the 0-1 matrix representation of relations, and never really elaborates on this representation (aside from it being possible).\n\nBecause my particular use case has a very small domain-size, I think that the 0-1 matrix representation might be useful. I've written up some basic functions which implement a few primitive operations (select, join and projection), but I'd be more comfortable if I had a book to guide me.\n\nIs anyone aware of a book on the subject?\n\nThe only book I'm aware of on the subject is maybe Volume4 of Knuth's \"Art of Computer Programming\". However, Volume4 is yet incomplete (and the important constraint-programming section is planned but not yet published in any fascicle). I've briefly looked at other constraint-programming books but none of them seem to elaborate on the 01 matrix representation either. I'm wondering if I'm looking in the wrong spots and maybe need to look at relational theory or something to find this info...\n\n----------\n\nFor people who aren't aware of the 0-1 representation of relations, [I've written a post elsewhere on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerTIL/comments/9fuccg/relations_with_closed_domains_can_be_represented/). Its certainly an exciting subject to me, but I assume that someone else has already mastered this subject matter and maybe I can learn from them.",

        "text": "I am due to start a mechanical and electrical engineering course at uni in the next few days, however these past few months I have been thinking about a switch to computer science. This would mean taking a gap year as the uni wont allow a transfer, so I have till the end of tonight I guess to decide what I'm going to do as the move in day is saturday.\n\nBasically, the more I have looked into the subjects , the more I have been put off of mechanical engineering, so if I were to start I would change to just electrical engineering. The thing I am put off by is the practical work and the practical work I would have to do when I get a job. Throughout school I have hated any practicals in physics, which includes working with oscilloscopes , ammeters voltmeters etc as it just involved testing circuits and writing long lists of results from the circuits, which I find quite tedious and boring. I also found the reports we had to write on these practicals about the accuracy and precision of equipment etc etc, also very boring. When choosing the degree initially I didn't keep that in mind and chose it just because I like maths and physics (less so with generators and electromagnetism as I find the concepts harder to grasp). Taking all of this into consideration, I am leaning towards a computer science degree.\n\nMy main reason for choosing engineering was the problem solving aspect of it and computer science is all problem solving, I have been trying some online courses in programming in python and watching some computer science lectures and have been finding them quite interesting. While the programming side I am interested in, the algorithms, data structures etc, I don't have much knowledge about and at this point am not 100% sure if the course would suit me as I have had no experience with the other topics. I was hoping someone could give some insight into the other topics in computer science and help me get out of this rut as I don't want to take a gap year just to find out that I don't suit computer science\n\n",

Almost every week, my professor give assignments(PDF files which describes like you have to create methods and classes following a description).\n\nI always somehow figure out a solution to those assignments and get a satisfactory grade on Canvas. My point is that I almost learn nothing from a professor or given materials. I'm not confident with my coding and knowledge about CS. Although my professor is nice and try hard to teach us as understandable as possible, they(instructions, or materials) sound surface and not practical. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEasy to read(due to my bad writing)\n\n1. The lecture doesn't give me sufficient knowledge of CS\n2. I want to study it deeply, but I'm not sure I have enough amount of time to learn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any of you have an insight or an idea, please put a comment! Thanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
