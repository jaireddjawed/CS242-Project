        "text": "History has shown time and time again that monarchies are extremely problematic and inefficient forms of government. In order for a monarchical government to function, there needs to be a clear line of succession within the ruler's family. Even the slightest of complications in the inheritance plans can (and often has) thrown their nation into shambles.\n\nThe sample of available heirs (and in extension, the nation’s political stability) is also dependent on the ruler's family size and relationship dynamics. If the ruler's family is too large, then there are too many competing heirs that often end up squabbling amongst themselves for power. Such infighting commonly escalate into civil wars that wind up tearing their nation apart.\n\nOn the other hand, if the ruler's family is too small, then the line of succession can easily be compromised by any sort of unforeseeable circumstances. In other words, if a ruler has a small family, their heirs cannot easily be replaced if they wind up dying prematurely. This problem is exacerbated if the deceased heirs pass away before they’re able to continue on the family line. If there are survivors available, they might be unfit to rule. As there isn’t a clear succession plan, the nation’s future is uncertain, and is very likely going to be thrown into a power vacuum.\n\nSometimes both of those scenarios feed into each other. I’ve heard of stories of victorious heirs purging their own relatives to eliminate rivals, and then being murdered themselves by other enemies. Thus leaving very few (if any) survivors of a ruling family.\n\nDespite these problems, historically speaking, monarchies can be found all across the globe. Cultures as diverse as the Sumerians, Mayans, Fijians, Medieval Europeans, Chinese, Zulus, etc. all used there for their government systems. Why is despite how fragile monarchies tend to be, they are so commonly found throughout world history?",

        "text": "Humans spent millennia evolving under pretty brutal conditions. However, in the last 200-250 years or so, and especially the last 100, there has been a departure from many barbaric traditional and ubiquitous behaviors, and I'm wondering if any work has been done to study the effects of this more enlightened behavior. At the same time, fertility rates have dropped and the Flynn Effect appears to be reversing as of late. Thus, it occurred to me that many of these behaviors we now view as abhorrent, may have still actually had some purpose from a Darwinian perspective (perhaps not dissimilar to how some animals e.g. abandon the runt of the litter to give the other offspring a better chance of survival) and I was curious if study had been done about this.\n\nPerhaps one of the more benign and easily observable phenomena along these lines is adherence to religion. TFR has dropped off significantly as society has become less religious, yet very religious groups such as the Amish, Hassidic Jews, etc. maintain extremely high TFR. Religion is ubiquitous throughout the world for nearly all of recorded history, so perhaps it is a construct that humans developed that helped them be more reproductively successful?\n\nSimilarly, for most of human history, a victorious army might be likely to indiscriminately kill men and rape/kidnap/enslave all the women of a conquered enemy. One could imagine that this might cause the \"weak\" genetics of the conquered to be replaced with the \"strong\" genetics of the conqueror and over generations and generations, create humans that were more \"fit\" in the Darwinian sense.\n\nThe list doesn't end there. Beating your children as discipline was common. Severe persecution of criminals and those who disrupted the social order was common. Absolute power structures were common. Overt racism and xenophobia was everywhere. High status men might have numerous wives and dozens of children.\n\nWhile we rightly regard these things as bad for society now, one can't help wondering if they have some greater evolutionary basis given how long lasting and ubiquitous they were. Has any study been done about how modern enlightened behavior and attitudes might be affecting humanity as a whole in the very long term?",

        "text": "Prompted by a now-removed post here, I'm wondering about rites of passage....\n\nMy memory of reading classic anthropology-type books was that every author seemed to confidently assert that X was the rite of passage for marriage, Y was the rite of passage for moving from childhood into adulthood, etc. They would always confidently tell the reader that these predictable social transitions always had a rite of passage.\n\nOf course, they would argue among themselves. So, Evans-Pritchard might tell us that among the Nuer the right of passage to adulthood would involve an initiation ceremony into the mysteries of adulthood (IIRC), following which there would be a hunt, and then the newly-minted young men would head off to a camp (a \"nak\", IIRC) where they would hang out together.... Then someone else would come along and point out that going to a nak could happen years later, so maybe that isn't part of the rite of passage.... Blah, blah, blah. .... But, if I'm remembering this correctly, they always assumed that there was \"a rite\" - a single (often religious) event.\n\nBut is this idea of a \"rite\" actually valid? Or is it a construct? Obviously birth and death are universal and occur at clear times, so it would be weird if they weren't ceremonially marked. But, for example, in the case of transitioning to adulthood, is there instead a sequence of events which typically but not always occur, and the quest for a \"rite\" is simply an over-simplification?\n\nSo if we look at present day Britain, we can see that as people move into adulthood they may have a religious rite (confirmation, bar mitzvah, amrit, etc. - though most don't), leave school, be able to order alcohol in public (though 25% of 16-25 years olds don't drink), get a driving license, be allowed to vote, graduate from university (though half don't), get a place of their own to live.... We kind of understand that it's a jumbled and flexible sequence. But would an outsider, doing some field work before going back to the Martial Anthropology Institute - oversimply this and construct a notion of a rite?\n\nOr put another way, if Evans-Pritchard was being less judgemental (or maybe had a more contemporary mindset) would he instead of described a sequence of life events (being put in charge of cattle, religious initiation, hunt, nak, owning cattle, etc.) rather than talk about a \"rite\"?\n\nMy reading is out of date now... so what is the current thinking on this?\n\n(Disclaimer: my anthropology studies didn't continue past the undergraduate level - so it isn't like I have a PhD in this or anything. So I'm coming at this as a passably well informed amateur, with quite out of date understandings. Apologies if anything above is too dumb!)",

I'm an undergraduate student about to graduate this semester from a combined B.A in History and Classics but as I look into grad programs I'm starting to wonder whether I should veer more towards anthropology.\n\nFor clarity, my research interests definitely integrate aspects of both History AND Anthropology because I'm so heavily focused on the social justice aspects of my work and understand that History hasn't always represented everyone, but that, likewise, many people recorded their experiences textually and that's a meaningful factor in understanding the past. I also don't exclusively examine texts or exclusively examine material culture---I do both. I also employ comparative historiography and comparisons in material culture (i.e, comparisons between how ancient Greeks visually depicted ancient Egyptians and vice-versa).  I believe that, in the majority of cases, it's the best methodology to employ when studying history and especially the people living it. For me, social and cultural (and in some cases archaeological) aspects are extremely important. \n\nI've tried asking different professors in the Social Sciences department at my university how they'd categorize my interests---and the irony of it all is that whether I ask a historian, anthropologist or sociologist about my work they all think it aligns most with their respective discipline. \n\nI'm hoping to work in museums in the future as a curator of ancient and premodern \"art\" (more accurately artifacts in many cases) especially in regards to curatorial ethics; or in higher education as a professor. I know for the latter it's easier to carve out a niche, but for museum careers I'm really unsure. I'm planning to get an MA in Museum Studies, but in regards to electives or getting further postgrad education (MA or PhD) I don't know if I should go the History or Anthropology route, or if my academic focus really is such a 50/50 split that it's worth it to try for a dual-degree in both.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

Some university in the United States has been working on a 3D interactive database model for an archaeological dig site either in Greece or Italy. The website allowed you to maneuver through a 3D environment that showed the layers of the dig and what artifacts were found where. It was important because it, among other things, visually connected the spatial proximities of various artifacts to one another. Each time you clicked on an artifact in the render, things like notes, pictures, or even associated audio files were linked. If I remember correctly, it was hosted on the university library's website. While not widely available, and still very much in progress and actively used by researchers, it could be found through conventional searching methods if you know what to look for. \n\nSorry that this isn't more specific. I've been thinking about this model for weeks, but I can't quite put my finger on the required search terms to find it again. If anyone has any ideas, I would be very grateful.

Are they breaking off from their community and then meeting up with them when it gets dark or every few days?\n\nI know that broadly, a lot of crops are bigger, juicier, and more nutrient/calorie rich than now, so if anything gathering enough to sustain would be more labor intensive. And plenty of edible items don't necessarily look edible, especially prior to centuries of genetic modification. And some items that do look edible either have no nutritional value or are actively poisonous. Which makes gathering an unknown item it more of a gamble.\n\nHow did they know where to look, considering they're nomadic to begin with vs intimately familiar with their small patch of the landscape? How did they know not only what was safe to eat, but what actually had nutritional value and was worth the labor involved? Would there have been disagreements? Was there a system for testing whether something was both safe and nutritious? Was there technology involved in gathering, like digging implements, cutting implements? Did they prepare the food on the spot (i.e., for acorns prep involves removing the shells and grinding them down)? Gathering is pretty much a solo job, so would they split up and then pool their findings back together? Or was everyone effectively gathering for themselves/their immediate dependents?",

        "text": "  \n\nThis is quite a specific question, so I start with some context before I pose my question. I have done historical research on the impact of the local context (Mende agency, missionary presence, British colonial administration) on the fieldwork of the Dutch social anthropologist Sjoerd Hofstra among the Sierra Leonean Mende (1934-1936). Hofstra’s archive contains fieldnotes on his encounters with Gbessi, a ‘Mende-man who acted like a woman’, and the dream which, according to Gbessi’, led him to his distinctive gender expression.\n\nGbessi travelled around Sierra Leone’s Southern Province as a masked Bundu-dancer of the Sandei-‘secret-society’, the female equivalent of the Poro. He had ‘quite the voice of a woman’, ‘walked slowly and hesitantly like a woman’, ‘\\[made\\] on the whole the same movements and gestes’ (gestures), and did work normally done by women, such as assisting in childbirth. Gbessi’s mother had been the leader of a local Sandei-lodge. When Gbessi’s mother died, she appeared to him in a dream, in which she told him where to find charms which would make him a gifted Bundu-dancer. Under the surface of a river he encountered non-ancestral spirits (*ngafei*), who indeed provided him with a charm. Yet, the spirits demanded that he would live the rest of his life as a woman, as men were not allowed to dance for the Sandei-society. After three days Gbessi found himself in his own house again. \n\nIn his fieldnotes, Hofstra writes that Gbessi already ‘acted like a woman’ before he ever dreamt of his mother, the charm and the non-ancestral spirits, suggesting that Gbessi sought to ‘explain’ a non-normative gender expression with the dream. It is unknown to me if Gbessi only told this story to Hofstra, as a European visitor with money and connections. However, Hofstra’s Mende guides/interlocutors Thomas Conteh and Samuel believed the story, and mentioned that they knew of more people like Gbessi: ‘who are between men and women.’ They were also somewhat afraid of Gbessi. \n\n**Question:** Is there more (historical) information on the way people like Gbessi (perhaps third gender?), related their gender expression to dreams (or ‘explained’ it in this way)? Perhaps in a broader West-African context? \n\nPS: The background story of these encounters is quite interesting as well, as Gbessi was imprisoned by the Dodo-*ndomahei* (‘Paramount Chief’) at the time. Some bathing Mende-women had supposedly seen Gbessi looking at them, against custom for a man. Hofstra, Conteh and Samuel questioned this narrative of the ndomahei, accused him of 'money-hunting'. Conteh and Samuel stated that the Dodo-women actually liked Gbessi. As they thought Gbessi's treatment and fine against ‘native rules and feelings’ they decided to free Gbessi and help him escape without paying his fine. Later, Gbessi told Hofstra that he had had a second dream, now with both the spirits and the Dutchman in it.",

I’ve since learnt that Graves was helped immensely by an uncredited lover in developing the theory and I sort of feel odd that the only sources I can remember on the above topics were written by men, so I’m definitely interested in reading feminist voices on the subject.",

And the thing is I am not sure what do they lack. **Of course, I know it would be best to ask them,** but these are not people I know personally and one of them explicitly told me that he cannot give me further comments since it would be unfair to other applicants. Also, if more than one person told me the same thing independently, I kind of lean to think  it's kind of objective weakness.\n\nSo I would really appreciate any advice, what kind of info would you expect to find in a future fieldwork plan in a 5-page proposal?

        "text": " \n\n**Journey after death**\n\nAfter death, the individual soul (*jīva*) enters an energetic subtle body and reaches the immediate upper sub-world called *Preta* *Loka.* There the soul waits for ten days for the inquiry of its deeds by God. During this period, its subtle body gets food from cosmic energy. Individual souls have different shades in their energetic bodies based on their qualities and deeds done.\n\nThe first world, *Bhū Loka,* is subdivided into four sub-worlds called *Martya* *Loka*, *Preta Loka*, *Naraka Loka* and *Pitṛ Loka*. This earth on which human beings exist is called *Martya* *Loka* or *Karma* *Loka*, which is the first sub-world of the first world, called *Bhū* *Loka*. This first sub-world is the place for doing deeds and hence, it is called a *karma* *loka*. Above this first sub-world, the other three upper sub-worlds of the *Bhū Loka* and the other worlds existing above the *Bhū Loka,* are invisible to human beings due to the unimaginable power of God. **But by the grace of God, some souls can see them.**\n\nWhen the inquiry is over in the *Preta* *Loka*, the individual soul with its subtle body, travels along one of four channels starting from the *Preta* *Loka* which is the junction. The channel along which a soul is sent depends on the inquiry of its deeds and the corresponding fruits that are to be enjoyed by the soul. The *Naraka* *Loka* and the *Pitṛ* *Loka*, which are the two uppermost sub-worlds of *Bhū Loka* lying above the *Preta Loka*, are called *bhoga lokas.* All worlds lying above the *Bhū* *Loka* are also called as *bhoga* *lokas*, which are the places meant for the enjoyment of the fruits of one’s deeds. The four possible channels through which souls are sent after the inquiry in the *Preta* *Loka* are:\n\n1. The third sub-world immediately above the *Preta* *Loka* is called *Naraka* *Loka,* which is hell. All sinners go to this world. Their souls are present in bodies which resemble black smoke. This body of smoke is called as *dhūma* *śarīra*. Note that the ‘food’ for all energetic bodies is cosmic energy itself. But for the souls in the *dhūma* *śarīras* this ‘food’ from the cosmic energy, is almost not supplied. The souls constantly suffer from terrible weakness. Very very little cosmic energy and that too very rarely, is supplied to them now and then; just to maintain the very mild energetic bodies. *Naraka* *Loka* (hell) is headed by Yama Dharmarāja. In the region just above this regular hell, special hells headed by Kālabhairava also exist.\n2. The uppermost sub-world of *Bhū* *loka* is called *Pitṛ* *loka* to which all neutral souls go. This sub-world is located on the moon. The body of the soul here is made of mild moonlight and is called as a *pitṛ* *śarīra*. Food for these bodies is supplied in the form of the light energy of the moon.\n3. The next immediate world above the *Bhū* *loka* is called *Dyu* *loka*. It is also called as *Jyotirloka* or *Bhuvarloka.* Souls who have done social service for fame on this earth, reach this world. In this world, the soul gets a body, which is like a little bright light and is called a *jyotiḥ* *śarīra*. Food is supplied to these bodies from the cosmic energy. This world lies is between *Bhū Loka* and the sun.\n4. Above this second world, exists the *Suvarloka* or *Svarga Loka* starting from the globe of the sun up to the pole star (Dhruva). It is also commonly called heaven. Souls reaching this world are those who have done good work of social service, which is not for fame. The here gets a body called a *bhoga śarīra*. Food for this body to is supplied from cosmic energy.\n\n**Once a soul attains an energetic body, material food is not at all required by its body.** It is said that the material food given to deserving priests, reaches the departed souls. But this is only an *arthavāda,* which is a lie told for a good purpose. It ensures that even a greedy person performs the death rituals and donates food to deserving receivers. It is very important to ensure that the receiver of our donation during any ritual is deserving of our donation. Donation to the deserving brings merit, while donation to the undeserving incurs sin.\n\nDo not think that the donation of food, clothes and money done to undeserving receivers is a mere waste. Actually, it yields punishment since such donation is sin. The Veda says that a receiver is deserving only if the person possesses the following two things (*Śrotriyasya chākāmahatasya*):\n\ni) Spiritual knowledge of the Veda (or of the holy scripture of one’s particular religion) and\n\nii) The lack of aspiration for receiving anything in return from the donor or performer of the ritual.\n\nThe priest is the principal receiver of the donation of money (*dakṣiṇā*) offered by the donor. Hence, the priest must explain the spiritual knowledge to the donor and other people assembled so as to improve their devotion. If this is not done, the whole ritual is a sheer waste! If the priest does this divine duty in the service of God without any aspiration in return, God will take care of everything for the priest.\n\n**Money cannot be the solution for everything whereas God’s grace solves all problems.** The merit earned in donating to deserving priests protects the departed soul as well as the performer of the ritual. I am not saying that the ritual should not be performed. \\*\\*What I say is that the ritual must be performed properly with perfect knowledge of the background (\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*Jñātvā kurīta karmāṇi—\\*\\*\\***Gita).** **By doing the rituals perfectly, good fruits are attained and the punishment for the sin of doing the rituals wrongly can be avoided.**\n\nFor souls who are on the path of *pravṛtti*, which is the path of worldly justice, we discussed the four channels along which they are sent depending on their good and bad deeds on earth. These four channels are limited to the *Bhūloka*, *Bhuvarloka* and *Suvarloka*. The individual souls after enjoying the good and bad fruits of their deeds in the upper worlds or the sub-worlds of *Bhū* *Loka*, return to earth. **This cyclic rotation always continues in** ***pravṛtti***\\*\\*. In the path of\\*\\* ***pravṛtti***\\*\\*, there is no spiritual knowledge or devotion to God. There is only doing good deeds to serve society and avoiding bad deeds which harm society.\\*\\* Social service is the highest merit in this field.\n\n[https://www.universal-spirituality.org/images/banner480\\_b3\\_v2o.jpg](https://www.universal-spirituality.org/images/banner480_b3_v2o.jpg)",

The exact location is less important if you'd have an otherwise fitting recommendation, since I'm writing something between fantasy and social science fiction, so the culture will be a synthesis of elements from several times/places rather than a faithful depiction of one.\n\nThanks!",

(But my parents and sister told me it is more common but not so much more and that sexism is not about hating women nor seeing them as lesser inferior beings, that it's about men having had the roles of power, because they were stronger so exerted strength to get them, etc. But that women were also thought to have a just as important role, in the home.)\n\nI believe it's thought that women like men as a gender more than men like women as a gender due to this. Because people think sexism means mistreating, hating, etc. And that it's thought women treat men better and with more respect.\n\nI believe it's thought that women like men in a more well rounded way than men like women, because of sexism and because because people think men objectify women and that if you took sex away... men would prefer men in all other ways (they think women are unfunny, they think that men are superior, etc.)\n\nI believe it's thought that sexism towards men is only a thing as backlash against sexism towards women. So women who hate men hate them for how men treat women.\n\nI believe traditional roles are not seen as equal but different and are instead seen as representing a belief that women are incapable and to serve men. \n\nI believe that when men do typically female hobbies and jobs women propel them to success and praise them for the bare minimum (which they wouldn't do for a woman with the same skills), like drag queens and gay male makeup artists. But women doing typically male jobs or hobbies are held to higher standards, have to prove themselves more, are not given the same support and are even verbally abused (Female gamers, female Mps, in sport, etc.) And that there are boy's clubs that are hostile towards women in male dominated workplaces, but not girl's clubs that are hostile towards men in female dominated workplaces.\n\nI believe it's thought that women hate each other, get jealous, compete and have internalised misogny, but that men have stronger bonds, friendships and camaraderie. (Even though my psychologist told me that it's instead believed that women mostly support each other.)\n\nMy parents and sister told me I was wrong about all of these things and that most people don't think these things, my sister identifies as a feminist herself. But I asked this on this very subreddit and they said my beliefs are \"extremely common.\" And everybody on here tells me this whenever I have asked. Why the contrast? What are your opinions? \n\n(They also said Reddit is an echo chamber &amp; confirmation bias and that most normal people don't interact with strangers online and wouldn't go on Reddit.)",

        "text": "I have been reading a few books written by sociologist Orlando Patterson, specifically his comparative study of slavery, Slavery and Social Death, as well as his history of the concept of freedom, Freedom In the Making of Western Culture. In both books, he makes use a concept he calls the \"Personalistic Idiom of Power\" to describe the power structure and the understanding of power that many societies had at one point in time. Specifically he says the West African Ashanti, Ancient Egyptians and most Mesopotamian civilizations are good exemplars, but seems to be willing to expand the concept to nearly everybody excepting the Greeks, Romans and later Western nations.\n\nEssentially the idea is that instead of a binary between free unowned people and owned slave, all people were in a sense the object of property. One was \"owned\" in a certain sense by their family, their community and so on, to the point where even the ruler was often thought of as owned by the Gods. Instead of \"rights\" or \"freedom\" the ideal position was to bound up in protective relations of power in which you have many benevolent masters and protectors, allowing no single master to dominate you, nor your boundlessness to make you vulnerable. He notes an Ashanti proverb, \"If you have not a master, a beast will catch you\" (Slavery and Social Death, 27). Freedom was not seen as a good thing, but rather being socially unbound from family, community, etc, meant that one could be easily captured and dominated with no one to offer protection. It was better to have the protection of many masters. So, for instance, a wife is not at the complete mercy of her husband because she is also under the control, and thus under the care of her father. Only the slave was under the complete domination of one person, in a condition of natal alienation, having no rights or claims, under the singular domination of his master.\n\n\"A person departed from the condition of slavery to the degree that he was able to spread the source of his protection as wide as possible-without, at the same time, making it too diffuse. Thus the real antithesis to slavery in societies where the personalistic idiom of power was dominant was what may be called countervailing power. People did not seek to be \"free\" (in the modern Western \"bourgeois\" sense of isolation from the influence of others) in such systems because, ironically, this was the surest path to slavery. Rather they sought to become embedded in a network of protective power.\" (Slavery and Social Death, 28)\n\nMy question is this: Does this idea of a Personalistic Idiom of Power actually hold water as an analysis of the mentioned societies? To what societies can it actually be applied? He seems to get it from an analysis of the Ashanti but generalizes it to include many more civilizations. Is this valid, or is the concept being overinflated? Is it even a good analysis if the dynamics of power among the Ashanti?",

Also, how plausible is some kind of civilization close to the early Sumerians in scope (population/agriculture/social complexity) pre-ice age? Finally, could writing have been developed pre-ice age and been lost to time (potentially due to not needing a transactional system with a smaller agricultural and pastoral scope during the ice age) or is it likely writing would have persisted through this time period due to its utility?\nApologies if this has been asked elsewhere or is too hypothetical with insufficient evidence.",
