I've been given over a dozen so far (over about 6 months). Most of them are around 10 years old but still boot up. If they are locked behind Windows (or iOS) passwords, it's ok because Linux writes over that. Linux Mint works pretty well on these old machines. After I'm done tinkering with them I offer them to people who need computers. \n\nI take anything with no questions. A few that I got were junk not worth working on. I salvage RAM and hard drive and then take them to Best Buy for their ewaste program.\n\nI've kept some of them that are kind of nice once I get them up and running again.

        "text": "I'm not sure when this \"no box\" policy started, but I have been an Amazon Prime member since they opened for business decades ago and have never had so many issues with my deliveries or returns. \n\n*No Amazon box provided for deliveries. \n*No box accepted for returns.\n\nRecently I received an email from Amazon upset over a few of my recent returns not being in the condition they should have been in... And so starts my rant...\n\nWHAT DO THEY EXPECT? When they don't protect items when they send them and they don't \"want\" items protected when returned, the chances of the item being damaged in transit is going to be HIGH.\n\nI can understand a large boxed item like an exercise bike or a microwave not being boxed because it already comes in a heavy duty box and it's too big for Amazon to use their own box, but everything else? They need to box it. \n\nThey are supposed to provide you with an Amazon boxing option, but that's not always the case. More and more, I am not being presented with that option. \n\nAside from the manufacturer's box getting heavily damaged through transit (because it was never meant to be shipped), the result can be your expensive item being stolen because everyone can see what it is. Please don't tell me that everyone who handles that box isn't tempted to make it disappear. Then, once it arrives at your door- IF it arrives at your door- you better hope there is no foot traffic near your home. It looks like you left something out from a garage sale and anyone nosey enough might decide to make a grab for it.\n\nThen there are the returns. Whatever your return reason may be (maybe your item came in a damaged manufacturer's box that was never meant to be shipped), Amazon isn't letting you box up your items for that return. It can be anything from a tiny little bracelet or keychain to a keyboard or a purse. Anything really. Just pick a random item. Something delicate. Something that didn't even come in a box in the first place and maybe was sent in a packaged envelope. \n\nAnd by \"not letting\" you use a return box or envelope, I mean \"not letting\"! I have tried, especially with the smaller items that don't have their own box. Neither Kohls or UPS will allow you to package it in anyway. Obviously the item doesn't get it's own label. It's usually too small or awkward shaped for that. It gets thrown in a box with other items and half the time disappears. I usually have to contact Amazon weeks later to upload my proof of return so I can get my refund. \n\nSo the email. The email Amazon sent complaining over a few of my returns not being in pristine condition... Blaming ME for issues they caused with their policies... Well Amazon, what do you expect? Obviously I have no control over how you ship an item and I have no control over how you return ship an item. If YOU don't care about protecting items during shipment, it's probably going to get damaged in transit going one way or the other or both. \n\nTo protect myself I now video document all of my Amazon purchases from the time I see them at the door to when (if) I return them. This no box policy has backfired on them tremendously. Probably costing them a ton of money. Don't let them blame YOU the customer. This is 100% on them.",

        "text": "Hello all, I wanted to post this in a group that could appreciate it as a frugal success. I will try to add pictures in the comments if I can. My fiancé is 6 foot three and has been wanting us to get a king bed for a while \n(we have been sharing a full-size bed). I do not have the money to buy a quality king size mattress at full price. I told him that I would find us a mattress and frame in time, but if I was going to partake in the purchase of it, I was not going to be able to pay full price. He agreed. One thing most frugal people know is if the price isn’t right now, just be patient. I was able to find a mattress that was originally sold at target for $1,395 priced brand new from one of those “pallet buyers” businesses for $399.50. I then found a great condition three year old IKEA bed frame with headboard on Facebook marketplace for $50 that was originally sold for $459. My fiancé and I are very happy with our purchase and now my frugal friend and her boyfriend are looking for a king bed as well to try to beat our price paid!",

She tries to work when she is in a good head space but she just can't do it. I guess my biggest issue is finding a way for her to watch TV. Without TV she will sleep all day. At least with tv she will be up some of the day.\n\nShe has to move to a new place. The landlord is already being super nice with the rent. After rent she has about $120 left for the month. She gets enough food stamps but that $120 needs to pay her electric and anything else she needs.\n\nShe watches hallmark most of the time and old shows like golden girls and Raymond. Stuff like that. I think we could get her free or cheap internet. Her tv isn't anything special but with prices if a smart tv would help with content then I might be able to buy her a 32in.\n\nI guess the question really is, what is everyone's opinions on the cheapest/easiest way to get her some tv? I looked and it seems a peacock subscription would get her hallmark. Is there anything better or cheaper?\n\nAdded info if needed is at my house we have Comcast and have Verizon for phones. My MIL has a flip phone on our Verizon plan so if the offer something I can look at that too.\n\nIf you have any questions i will try to answer throughout the day. Im at work now. Thanks for the help.",

        "text": "Hi all, \n\nApologies this has gotten quite long. \n\nI’m pretty frugal , I hate overpaying for things and this culture of having to spend money just to exist. However, as much as I cut costs EVERYWHERE - I do like to make a point of my lifestyle not affecting my friends negatively. If I do find a great deal on something that’s too many/much for me I also like to be generous with my frugal finds. \n\nMy problem lies in another frugal friend of mine - you’d think that we’re more compatible with our shared frugal values but I’m finding that she is making me feel quite used, and we aren’t able to extend our frugal principles the way we practice them together. Specifically the way we eat and drink around each other. \n\nHere are some problems I have : \n- she will ask to have dinner together. I used to always host dinner so we could cook instead of eat out, but that was because I lived alone and am close to her workplace, and had the luxury of not worrying about pissing off flatmates. I now do not live alone , and everytime we plan to have a meal together and I know my shared spaces aren’t useable, I make sure she knows that we will have to meet outside my house and instead will have to eat out. This has led to : \n-her asking to meet for dinner, me saving up and skipping meals to get the most out of a meal out , only for her to say she’s already eaten and is surprised I haven’t (when she’s asked to meet for dinner!!!) and I end up being the only one eating at a restaurant because I’m starving by then and she nothing or a coffee etc. i always feel bad for the staff \n- Or her trying to suggest free food /pay what you can stores when we try to meet for dinner , which are aimed at the poverty line , which I feel uncomfortable using as we both are well enough salaried and no longer actually required to be frugal. And her cancelling plans last minute if I don’t agree to this. \n- Her asking me to “be there while she meets with someone who makes her uncomfortable” and she will take him to a restaurant and will order nothing while he orders a meal - and I order a drink because I feel bad for the staff who have a 3 person table but only 1 person is ordering ! Again, she tried to change this meet up into a non-restaurant item (which she had told me for once, and I had already eaten) but it become clear that her guest had been expecting to get a meal with her and she hadn’t told him she had eaten. Although I wanted to be supportive to her with a person who was a bit rude to her, I didn’t appreciate her putting me on the spot like that and being oblivious to how this affects the staff. \n\nWe also have a 5 person friend group, we are all quite generous with each other and have known each other for ~15 years. The others were always very generous to me and her while we were low income , and then I was generous to her as I got a proper job and no longer had reason to take others generosity without reciprocation , and she was the last to come out of low income life , but still doesn’t pitch into the group activities/meals/drinks but will happily partake. It’s not just me who ends up covering for her, but I seem to be the one getting annoyed about it. \n\nTo be clear we in middle class salaries now, she’s very open about her new job paying well. She also is very open about her love language being gifting and how much she spends/spent on her lovers and how money is no object when she loves someone (valid, just adding this as an indication of how she’s not in a dire situation) \n\nAnother habit of hers is that she will never bring a bottle of wine or beers etc to our group events but she will almost always say yes when offered a drink (tbh it would be weird in this group if anyone didn’t offer). If I ask her beforehand if she’s going to pick anything up before we head to event (as I do), she’ll always say she’s not planning on drinking. The entire group is quite into drinking - and the others can be quite fancy , but I always make sure I’m contributing if not bringing my own (bargain) drinks so I’m not scrounging off anyone. As they’re quite generous with me, I always let them know to help themselves to my drinks but I’m finding it difficult to exclude her from this when she never contributes. Especially since I host a bit, (and maybe because she feels my cheaper drinks are less of a deal when she drinks as much as I do?) she often will rely on my contribution more than the others. (Although there is one other friend in this group she does rely on spending a lot of money too, but doesn’t seem to care). \n\nWe are very aware we’re the more frugal ones in this group, and we have had perks to our relationship and have good discussions and share tips about deals /savings tips etc. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or an explanation as to\n- why she doesn’t just tell me/others to have food at home and then we go for a walk etc instead of always asking we can meet for dinner that she’s already eaten? \n- Why she doesn’t seem to want to reciprocate with the close friend group/has an expectation that costs will be covered ahead of time and therefore not necessary to split. (One person in the group is an avid planner and gets anxiety if they don’t plan and book things well in advance, and I always make sure to offer and split then for their efforts and to be considerate of their labour as well acknowledge I benefit from it) \n\nI’m just a little frustrated and lost about how inconsiderate this feels, and I am feeling used despite our shared values about finances. I feel I’m always bridging the gap between her frugality and her desire to do things that require her to spend money on/FOMO. We used to be quite close but this is causing a rift. What would you do \n\nPlease feel free to tell me if I’m being entitled also, I do have issues with feeling my indebted to anyone (was financially abused as a child) and making sure I contribute. I also might be assuming too many things about the staff, which is on me. This may be more of my own issues than I realise.",

The last car I owned  (more than 10 years ago) was one I bought from my father.   I've never bought a car from a dealer.\n\nI'm nearly financially independent, so I have quite a large budget for a vehicle.  However, while I'm still living in an urban area (and parking on the street, where it's basically 24/7 \"bumper-cars\"), I don't want to buy a really nice vehicle until I move out of the city.  But I want something reasonably reliable in the meantime.  I just don't want to get ripped off if I go to a dealer to try to buy a car.  I also will probably feel very nervous trying to do a \"test drive\" in an urban area, since I haven't driven regularly in a long time.\n\nDoes anyone have some tips/advice?",

Since then, I found a few eBay stores that sell primarily “returns”, that may have been worn at most a few times, and are shipped in their original box.  I’ve been able to purchase the exact same sneakers for her for $67, $80, $64, and $47, and all 4-pairs were as described in excellent condition with no signs of wear, dust or dirt. Like all eBay purchases, you still have to scrutinize the pictures and description to assess overall condition, and you won’t always get your favorite color, but for high-cost sneakers like my wife wears, the savings far outweigh the fashion.",
