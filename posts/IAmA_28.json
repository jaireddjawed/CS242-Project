We built an AI-powered system assisting them in doing an amazing job. So yes, we can all agree that automated phone trees are frustrating. Thankfully that's not what this is about.\n\n- We're not a bot IVR system (\"Press 1 for an awful experience, 2 to get frustrated\").\n- We're not replacing humans with robots\n- We are not ushering the downfall of humanity (but I've enjoyed that discussion, so thanks)\n\n-----\n\nHello Reddit! My name is Justin Maxwell. I've designed websites, apps, products &amp; led design teams for Apple, Google &amp; Android, Mint.com/Intuit, Sony, and some very bad ideas startups along the way, ranging from those that fizzled out to those that turned into books &amp; movies...like Theranos. (Oh, I even got to make the vector art for Jhonen Vasquez's Invader Zim logo along the way.)\n\nEventually I realized I'm a terrible employee, I hate writing weekly status reports for managers, and I like building things directly for customers I can speak with. So, in 2015, I started [Smith.ai](https://smith.ai) with Aaron Lee (ex-CTO of The Home Depot) — we're customer qualification for small businesses, with humans assisted by AI. We're popular with Attorneys, I.T. Consultants, Marketers, and a long tail of everyone from home remediation to agricultural lighting systems providers.\n\nIn the past 3 years we've been growing in the high double digits, answered hundreds of thousands of calls, our customers love us, and we're able to even give back to the charities &amp; communities our team cares about. What sets us apart is our combination of humans + AI and extreme focus on customer need. So, ask me anything!\n\n**Proof:** (first time trying truepic, lmk if this is incorrect) https://truepic.com/GXRIPLLA/\n\n(this is being x-posted to /r/law and /r/lawschool)\n\n-----\n\nThank you all so much for this incredible discussion. I honestly thought this was a 1 hour AMA that would fizzle out by 10am PST...and then we hit front page and the AI doomsdayers showed up. Then we got into some real juicy stuff. **Thank you.**\n\nEdit (2018.08.29): I do not wish to [add you to my professional network on LinkedIn](https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2015/09/a-new-universal-new-yorker-cartoon-caption-id-like-to-add-you-to-my-professional-network-linkedin/406783/).

Three years ago, I started spending nights and weekends trying to help gamers gain control of their lives. \n\nI now work in the Addiction division of McLean Hospital, the #1 Psychiatric Hospital according to US News and World report [(Source)](https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/rankings/psychiatry). \n\nIn my free time, I try to help gamers move from problematic gaming to a balanced life where they are moving towards their goals, but still having fun playing games (if that's what they want). \n\n--- \nVideo game addiction affects between 2-7% of the population, conserved worldwide. In one study from Germany that looked at people between the ages of 12-25, about 5.7% met criteria (with 8.4% of males meeting criteria. [(Source)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508060/)\n\nIn the United States alone, there are between ~10-30 million people who meet criteria for video game addiction. \n\nIn light of yesterday's tragedies in Jacksonville, people tend to blame gaming for all sorts of things. I don't think this is very fair. In my experience, gaming can have a profound positive or negative in someone's life. \n\n---\n\n**I am here to answer your questions about mental health &amp; gaming, or video game addiction. AMA!**\n\n\n\n**My Proof:** https://truepic.com/j4j9h9dl\n\nTwitter: [@kanojiamd] (https://twitter.com/kanojiamd)\n\n---\n\nIf you need help, there are a few resources to consider:\n\n- [Computer Gamers Anonymous] (http://cgaa.info/)\n\n- If you want to find a therapist, the best way is to contact your insurance company and ask for providers in your area that accept your insurance. If you feel you're struggling with depression, anxiety, or gaming addiction, I *highly recommend you do this.*\n\n- If you know anything about making a podcast or youtube series or anything like that, and are willing to help, please let me know via PM. The less stuff I have to learn, the more I can focus on content. \n\n**Edit:** Just a disclaimer that I cannot dispense true medical advice over the internet. If you really think you have a problem find a therapist per Edit 5. I also am not representing Harvard or McLean in any official capacity. This is just one gamer who wants to help other gamers answering questions.\n\n**Edit:** A lot of people are asking the same questions, so I'm going to start linking to common themes in the thread for ease of accessibility. \n\n- [Gender dynamics, and why male gamers can be assholes to female gamers online.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9asjht/iama_harvardtrained_addiction_psychiatrist_with_a/e4zregm/)\n\n- [How I went from failing into college to psychiatry training at Harvard Medical School] (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9asjht/iama_harvardtrained_addiction_psychiatrist_with_a/e4z5pro/)\n\n- [How intelligent gamers become avoidant in life. Part 1] (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9asjht/iama_harvardtrained_addiction_psychiatrist_with_a/e4y5qc5/)\n\n- [How intelligent gamers become avoidant in life. Part 2] (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9asjht/iama_harvardtrained_addiction_psychiatrist_with_a/e4yjbl4/)\n\n- [On Lootboxes and addiction.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9asjht/iama_harvardtrained_addiction_psychiatrist_with_a/e4y5qc5/)\n\n- [On ADHD, gamer cognitive fingerprint, and a few random points about not being able to follow through.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9asjht/iama_harvardtrained_addiction_psychiatrist_with_a/e4ybeg0/)\n\n- [How gaming crosses the line from being a healthy coping mechanism to an addiction.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9asjht/iama_harvardtrained_addiction_psychiatrist_with_a/e4y4y55/)\n\n- [How gaming is different from substance use addictions, like heroin.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9asjht/iama_harvardtrained_addiction_psychiatrist_with_a/e4xrw8x/)\n\n**Edit #9: Ok guys, I'm completely tapped out. I've been doing this for over a day, and I just don't have any juice left. I'd like to say thank you for reading, participating, and sharing your opinions. I've learned a lot about gaming addiction today, and I'm grateful. My hope is that I'll be able to take the questions and comments from this AMA and digest them to more effectively help people who are struggling. If you're late to the party and have questions, shoot me an email (problematicgamingama@gmail.com), and if you need help, please do so as well. I'm inspired to create more content that is widely available, because there's just no way I can help all of you individually. Thanks L'Reddit!**\n\nI'll try to respond to backlogged comments over the next few days. \n\nAnd obligatory thank you to the people who gave me gold! I don't know how to use it, and just noticed it. \n\n\n",

When I am not flying, I work on a project called BaseBeta -- if you are jumper, check it out at [basebeta.com](https://basebeta.com) \\-- with my girlfriend Jean and a team of volunteers that is dedicated to providing laser profiles of wingsuit/tracksuit exits, providing gps start analysis tools, and approach beta.\n\nProof: [https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/basebeta/redditIAMA.jpg](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/basebeta/redditIAMA.jpg)\n\nFor additional media visit:\n\n[youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/brendandubs)\n\n[brendandubs](https://instagram.com/brendandubs)\n\n[facebook](https://www.facebook.com/brendanweinsteinofficial)\n\n[gregoryinoonan](https://www.instagram.com/gregoryinoonan/)\n\nUpdate 1: Fell asleep over here. Keep the questions coming. I'll be doing my best to answer them throughout the day.\n\nUpdate 2: Thanks for all the love reddit. Gonna keep doing my best to keep up with the questions.\n\nUpdate 3: Floored by the response this thread has gotten. So stoked that there are so many budding future wingsuit pilots.\n\nCheck out [dropzone.com](https://dropzone.com) to find your nearest dropzone to start learning to skydive. That's the first step! For the large number of folks interested in risk, self delusion, sports psychology, I recommend reading \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" by Daniel Kahneman. That was one of my favorite reads this year and super relevant to what we do.\n\nThere were also a fair number of questions about money and work. Software development is a job you can do in many places around the world. I currently do contract work for a fully remote company. My girlfriend does remote software development work as well. Neither of us have formal education for it and are self-taught. My main motivation for pursuing that career path was having a healthy budget for wingsuit adventures. I've still found myself living out of a car for many months, but I am super happy. The path is not for everyone, but if you really want to make it happen -- you might want to consider the benefits of remote IT work combined with the occasional paid sports gig. It's not a bad life.\n\nWill be back on tomorrow to answer more questions and will be calling it a wrap after tomorrow (August 28).  \n\n\nUpdate 5: It's been fun reddit! Thanks for the great questions, jokes, and dialogue. I am most responsive on Instagram. If you have more questions and want to chat, hit me up there. Stoked to see how many people are interested in getting started with skydiving. I think you all should do it. Cheers!",

In the village on Anaktuvuk Pass we had more food mailed in and finally we had a floating plane which brought our boat and more food to the head waters of Noatak River. In total we consumed around 240lbs of food with a calory-density of around 2200cal/lb.\n\n​\n\nThis summer was special in the Brooks Range: In the east, June was unusually cold and snowy. There is little measurements to back this up but Kirk Sweetstir, a bush pilot legend in the area said, that he has never seen a June that bad in the 30 years he's been out there. This also caused the only other team attempting the full traverse this summer to abort their plans. Thanks to our extensive mountaineering experience, we were able to battle our way through hip deep snow and later through dangerously deep rivers. July was much better and in the end we even had really hot days on the Noatak River with temperatures up to 75 degrees (24 Celsius).\n\nOur website: [http://northwards.ch/?lan=en](http://northwards.ch/?lan=en) \\[please note: Not all content is translated to english, please use Google Translate if you are interested.

Expected a couple questions and now they are coming in fast. Please use Ctrl+F to find the usual questions like \"How much did it cost?\", so I don't have to answer that 100 times. Other than that. Keep it coming. I might not be able to keep up right now but I'll try to answer all questions in the coming days.\n\nOh yeah, also we have a facebook page: [www.facebook.com/BrooksTraverse/](https://www.facebook.com/BrooksTraverse/)Also I have Instagram. Maybe I'll be a bit more active if I get some followers, haha:  [**reiemanuel**](https://www.instagram.com/reiemanuel/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ok, I'll go to bed now. If there is something you really wanna know: Keep asking, I'll come back from time to time and answer some more.**",
