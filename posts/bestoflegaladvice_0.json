(It might have been me, honestly. We'll never know.)\n\nI know this might be kind of a bummer, sometimes deleted posts are some of the most off the wall, pants on LAOP's head, fun to read! But inevitably, the comment section turns into a bunch of people using comment removal sites and bashing LAOP's for deleting, and basically everything that makes up rule 9. And we like rule 9, even if sometimes it takes away a fraction of the fun. \n\nThis rule will *not* apply to BoLA posts that are posted before an LAOP deletes their post. However, any attempts to use comment retrieval sites after a deletion will result in a lil' smack on the hand and a very stern look of disapproval. \n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go put on my footie pj's, watch the Ted Lasso premier, and wait in vain to see if Hozier drops his new album two days early. Catch you on the flipside.",
