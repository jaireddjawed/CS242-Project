So what I'd do is try to make jokes out of the whole thing and yeah when you're making a big joke out of it it's never going to be scary.\n\nI recently saw Skinamarink and I really loved it and I totally understand it's not for everyone but I've been obsessing over it and eating up all the youtube content about it I could find. There's a video I saw of a guy reacting to it except he's live watching it on twitch and the whole time trying to make jokes about it and talking over it and reading chat. And then he's like yo this shit doesn't scare me at all bro I'm too messed up nothing scares me. And that just reawoke that frustration in me.\n\nI guess it just annoys me because people are missing out on something they might actually enjoy because they feel this need to not take it seriously and then after that even take pride in the fact that it didn't have the desicred effect on them.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: I feel like what I said is being interpreted by some more as me having an issue with people not being scared of horror media.

He was explaining that movies aren't the same as they used to be largely because the 'at-home' profits aren't there. \n\nBasically, before streaming filmmakers could rely on two sources of profit: the theatrical release and the 'at-home' DVD\/VHS. Let's say there's a $25M movie and then marketing costs $25M. And then theaters take ~50%. So to be profitable that movie needs to generate $100M+. If you didn't meet it during the theatrical release, you had a chance to meet it during the at-home release. \n\nWith streaming there is no 'at-home' release. That means you need to be successful after the initial release. To accomplish this, movies are catered to a much wider audience. They're designed for a global release rather than national. Essentially, nuanced films are less likely to be profitable on a global market and are a bigger gamble. \n\nHorror seems to be one of the few genres that can create nuanced films for the sake of story telling largely for the fact that success on a global scale has never been achievable at the scale of drama and comedy.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678755270.0},{"title":"Thoughts on Disturbing Behavior (1998)?","author":"prolelol","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11qu56l\/thoughts_on_disturbing_behavior_1998\/","text":"Shame that it was too short at only 84 minutes when it was originally supposed to be 115 minutes long.

Not only was the story some of the worst writing I've encountered, the entire VIBE was different. \n\nI think I see where they were going, that the evil has spread into the very fibers of Haddonfield. Much like what happened to Derry Maine. But holy God they missed the mark in my opinion. \n\nHas any sequel ever dropped the ball as hard as this one?

I hate to do this because a lot of people like the film and I can see why.  It\u2019s got atmosphere for days, performances are good across the board, and there is a certain genuineness to the whole production.  This isn\u2019t me hating the movie, just a frustration with the handling of the themes and plot.\n\n2) I knew the plot and twist prior to seeing the film.  \n\n3) I\u2019m actually interested in hearing how other people interpreted the story.  I hated the ending of Swiss Army Man until a friend shared their interpretation of the ending, then I loved it.  So maybe someone else\u2019s take might change my mind.\n\nSo let\u2019s begin:\n\nThe film seems to want to establish Goodman as having done something wrong by attempting to debunk supposed paranormal phenomena.  Several moments suggest this is his big sin and mostly a pathological attempt to avoid the guilt he has over what happened when he was a kid, and partly from a religious based childhood trauma.  Suggesting only guilty or bitter people would be skeptical of the supernatural?\n\nCharles Cameron accuses him of covering up or editing out things, but we never see that as the audience.  The first bit we see with Goodman is him exposing a fraudulent psychic (redundant phrase).  Nothing suggests he covered anything up.  So what was he doing that was so bad?  Exposing a fraud as a fraud?\n\nEven when he interviews the subjects, he seems mostly respectful and asks reasonable questions.  YouTuber Ryan Hollinger (who I generally love and would recommend for horror review content) described Goodman in the review as arrogant and condescending and generally unlikable and I\u2019m not sure what movie Ryan was watching.  Hell, a lot of people are unnecessarily hostile to Goodman.\n\nBut\u2026all of the above issues are sort of irrelevant.  Because the movie undermines every point it seems to be trying to make with the \u201ctwist\u201d.\n\nFirstly, it further vindicates Goodman\u2019s skepticism.  None of the stories he looked into were real.  They were all just a comma fantasy.  So we have no reason to think he ever debunked anything other than real frauds.  Yet the movie continues to act like exposing the truth was somehow wrong because it hurt people\u2019s feelings.\n\nBut more than that, did Goodman even have a show?  Since we learn Charles is just the impression of a former teacher for one of the doctors in the room.  We have no reason to think this professor was a debunker, since he would have taught a medical doctor, and yet Charles is cited in the first scene as being Goodman\u2019s inspiration for the show and his career.  And the doctor in the last scene indicates Goodman was a professor, but doesn\u2019t say anything about him formerly being a TV host.\n\nSo, with the twist, we actually know even less about Goodman\u2019s character, even as everything about the theme and plot rest on him.\n\nAlso, if we take the apparition of Callahan as literal, why is is ghost going after Goodman instead of the real bullies?  \n\nThe most generous interpretation I can give is that Goodman was a professor, who\u2019s father was a jerk and who had experienced the events in his childhood, but the entire debunking was just a coma fantasy meant to symbolize his dealing with guilt.\n\nSorry for the long post but I\u2019ve been eager to talk about this with someone.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678724044.0},{"title":"Is the Scream TV series worth watching?","author":"The01dLonelyPigeon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11qozet\/is_the_scream_tv_series_worth_watching\/","text":"I\u2019m debating about checking the show out but I\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s actually worth it or a waste of time before I do.

She's talking about how she's not going to take it back, and she's not sorry. She thinks she's talking to someone else. You see her walking around but it looks like the camera is a fixed angle or a fixed point. You see MBB and Ghostface in a chase, and then the camera angle starts to change and follow the action. Ghostface has her pinned and is about to kill her when you see an arm extend out and stab Ghostface in the back. He falls to his death and MBB looks up, but she's not thankful, she's horrified. This whole scene was actually from this person's perspective, and they kill MBB.\n\nImmediately after this scene you see a recap of Sam dropping the mask on the ground at the end of 6, and somebody picking it up. It gets into our main casts lives, and the core four is closer than ever. It's teased that the online chatter from Scream 6 has formed a little community of Ghostface worshipers who are trying to take his place. More new fodder cast is added. Sam has been getting texts from a random number that are a little creepy but not threatening. After one of the murders, which seemed off, she gets a text saying we need to meet now. They set up a time to meet as an ambush. After a little while of nothing happening she turns around only to see Billy's mask she dropped in the last movie. She's about to lash out when the guy drops the mask he's holding up and says, \"Woah, hold on, I'm here to help,\" and it's none other than Noah Foster.\n\nHe tells the core four about Brandon James, a man who killed people in 1994. He thinks that partially helped inspire Billy Loomis in 1996. He, Kirby and Mindy have a nerdgasm over scary movies and what not. They go and investigate with the help of Kirby and Gale and find some old things of Billy's. He had random notes on Brandon James before his death. As they find this out, a Ghostface attacks but is shot from behind. By Emma Duval.\n\nThe Brandon James storyline gets resolved. He's been killing other Ghostfaces imitators (hence the first scene) who are trying to take credit for the stuff he inspired. He also wants to protect Emma (it's revealed MBB in the first scene had been talking about screwing over Emma). In the last act, before that's revealed Chad\/Tara had set up a trap and were wearing Ghostface costumes. Brandon kills Chad (who dies protecting Tara), and Tara is wounded.\n\nIt ends with Emma trying to place peacekeeper between Brandon and Sam, explaining to Sam what's happening and some backstory on him. Tara stumbles by in this moment bleeding out and Brandon finishes her off in one of those moments that stresses you out because you know who that is but he clearly doesn't. Sam kills Brandon brutally in a rage. It ends.\n\n**SCREAM 8**\n\nOur opening scene is another classic phone call Scream-style...except the person on the phone is Gale. Ghostface comes after but she's dealt with this many times now and fends him off. She's bleeding badly and pulling herself towards her phone that fell on the floor. There's another Ghostface standing over it. She struggles to her feet to run the other way only to bump into another one. These Ghostface's kill Gale.\n\nSam is in the psych ward. She hasn't recovered from losing Tara. She's seeing her in her dreams and doesn't know how to cope. After this one by one all the main cast start getting picked off by numerous Ghostfaces. Noah who is hanging out with Mindy, Brooke from the show, Kirby, people introduced last movie, people from old movies, etc. One after another they all die. All except Emma.\n\nEmma is terrified and flies to get Sam's help. Sam is not happy to see her and reacts manically. Emma is begging her for her help. The longer the conversation goes the more calm Sam gets. The longer it goes the more tense Emma feels. She starts realizing Sam is the mastermind behind this. Tara's death finally caused her to snap and truly embrace the Loomis inside her. Emma tries to escape but gets killed.\n\nSam leads a meeting in a warehouse. She is surrounded by Ghostfaces. Sam used the online community that created Ghostface worshipers to build herself a Ghostface army. That way she can finally end all of this. She puts on her fathers mask and says there is only one thing left to do.\n\nWe cut to Sidney Prescott at home chilling with her family. She sees on the news everyone who has been killed, including Gale. She sends her family off to be protected.\n\nThe last act of the movie is Sidney vs. an army of Ghostfaces. She takes them out almost John Wick-style but obviously more realistic and horror based. It ends with only her and Sam left. After an intense battle Sidney kills Sam, finally concluding the Ghostface part of her life so she can move on.\n\nWhatcha think?","upvote_ratio":0.25,"created_utc":1678768344.0},{"title":"Vivarium (2019)","author":"Halloween__1978","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11qhlrl\/vivarium_2019\/","text":"In Vivarium (2019) when the child is screaming then the woman (Jemma I think) says \u201cYour fcking disgusting\u201d why did she say that?

I also like the first Creepshow film too, and will try the second one.","upvote_ratio":0.42,"created_utc":1678730912.0},{"title":"Dissecting The Outwaters (2023) : An Effort to Know the Unknowable","author":"Bashful_Ray7","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11ppylw\/dissecting_the_outwaters_2023_an_effort_to_know\/","text":"  \n\nThe following essay will attempt to theorize, decipher, and explain (in the best manner I can, given the opaque material) the events of my favorite horror flick of the last several years; The Outwaters (2023) directed by Robbie Banfitch.\n\nI will do my best, after a third viewing, to provide some answers to those left baffled and a medium for discussion for those who would love to pitch their own theories in the comments. I understand that, for many, this movie did NOT work and I completely understand and sympathize with those who feel this way. However, I have been relatively enthralled by it and would love to discuss it with enthusiasts in the comments. This thread will have explicit and in-depth spoilers, so avoid if you intend on viewing this film (as blind viewing is absolutely ideal).\n\n****For those only interested in a TLDR timeline, it's wayyyy down at the bottom.****\n\nFirstly I would like to provide a few premises for the ideas I will present.\n\n1) To recap characters and terms for reference, Michelle (vocalist), Angela (make-up), Scott (Robbie\u2019s brother), our cameraman (Robbie), our physical villain (Axe-Robbie, just the term for Robbie after he picks up the axe and is told to \u201cshow them\u201d. Robbie and Axe-Robbie are the SAME PERSON just at different points in \"time\"), our supernatural\/eldritch horror villain and the cause of the insanity the group experiences (\u201cThe Light\u201d). The events that occur later in the film during Cards 2 and 3 while the characters are under the influence of The Light will be referred to as \u201cThe Nightmare\u201d.\n\n2) The events are portrayed as found footage. As such the events CANNOT be a delusion. What we see as the viewer is actually what happened. If the events we witness were all in our cameraman Robbie\u2019s head, they would not have been captured on film. If you\u2019re seeing it, it\u2019s actually, physically happening. I will walk through the major events in the movie with rough timestamps so you can follow along if you would like.\n\n3)  Once \u201cThe Nightmare\u201d begins the rules of time, in the linear way we experience it, are largely irrelevant. The film presents to us in the opening moments that the recordings are shown to us as they were recorded chronologically. This means they are also presented in the order IN WHICH ROBBIE EXPERENCES THEM, as he devolves from eager cameraman to axe-wielding, disemboweling, head-staking mad man. However, the events he experiences DO appear to occur sporadically or \u201cout of order\u201d in a traditional linear sense. \n\nTake events A,B, and C, where \u201cevent A\u201d is Robbie peering up at the figure on the hill and \u201cevent C\u201d is Robbie picking up the axe at the top of the hill to \u201cshow them\u201d (translation: kill them). Whereas time generally flows: A -> B -> C, the film depicts events A, B, and C occurring in seemingly random order or, at times, all at once. Robbie is able to attack himself with the axe because time is not flowing A -> B -> C once The Nightmare begins. Events A and C are happening simultaneously. Robbie seeing himself on the hill AND standing on the hill with the axe are happening at the same time because events in time are no longer occurring in a linear fashion. Rather, they are happening in random sporadic order or, at times, all at once.\n\nFrom this It also seems we can conclude there is a time loop. More on that later.\n\n4) Many of the events in Cards 1 and 2 are repeated in Cards 2 and 3 with some gruesome differences. I will try and make note of those moments as best I can. Of note, the only person in the group who seems cognizant of this is Robbie. The rest of the group seems to act out past events as they previously occurred, unaware they are now drenched in gore (as an example). We also only ever see two versions of Robbie simultaneously. At no point do we see multiple versions of anyone else at once. I believe this is because Robbie is the one who peers into \u201cThe Light\u201d and is tasked with \u201cshowing\u201d the group what he experienced\/has come to know.\n\n5) I will letter different points throughout the following explanation and connect related points so that it makes it a little easier to connect the dots on certain theories. For example, if point A connects to point G, I will place a (G) at the end of point A to note their connection. At the end I will do my best, with a broad stroke, to create a linear timeline of the movie\u2019s major events\/deaths. It won't be perfect, but it's as close as I can come to forcing linear, chronological rules of time on a movie that doesn't follow these rules.\n\nWith those prefaces established, let us dive in\u2026\n\nA) 0:35 \u2013 Film opens with a hysterical 911 call and we are introduced to our soon-to-be victims. Here it is stated that the footage is shown in order of its recording, putting to bed any theories that the proceeding events are a delusion\/dream (camera could not record a delusion). A few important squeals here include Angela\u2019s repeated \u201cWhat\u2019s happening!?\u201d that we will revisit later. Robbie says \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it already happened\u201d, as out of the group he seems to be the only one cognizant that events are repeating. First hint that time will jumble sporadically through the movie. Another definitely from Robbie, \u201cshh, shh, shh\u201d to Angela who is freaking out, and \u201cdid you see it?\u201d(\u201cit\u201d referring to The Light and the strange voice\u2019s demand that Robbie \u201cshow them\u201d \u201cit\u201d.) Mentioning these just to \u201ctimestamp\u201d, as best we can, the moment later in the movie that the phone call is made. At the time of the call, Axe-Robbie has already killed Scott and Michelle (more on that later). (W, X)\n\nB) 5:34 \u2013 first of a few earthquakes (second around 17:00). My only theory on these is that the shifting earth is perhaps what \u201cawakens\u201d or \u201cexposes\u201d The Light. Another theory, due to the presence of a gas mask and quarantine sign later in the movie, is that some sort of nuclear testing\/bombing occurred which stirred or exposed The Light. (A, PP) (Credit u\/yitzilitt for helping me remember that the desert in question is the Mohave desert. The Mojave Desert was\u00a0used by the U.S. during World War II for testing various nuclear-radioactive weapons to compete with the Soviet Union, which supports this theory)\n\nC) 10:00-14:30 \u2013 Robbie flies home for his mother\u2019s birthday, spends time hanging out with Angela, recruits her to fly back with him to do Michelle\u2019s make-up for the music video Robbie and Michelle are making. \n\nD) 19:00 \u2013 Angela stays Robbie\u2019s apartment. She\u2019s married\u2026 which has implications later. They party, she definitely sounds a bit coy and flirty when filming him... Scott is volunteer to go with them to the desert for the filming (MM)\n\nE) 23:50 \u2013 Michelle stacks some small rocks for some reason? Unexplained, but I believe seeing this is why Robbie inexplicably stack rocks and dirt later (CC)\n\nF) 25:35 \u2013 27:11 \u2013 our group swims in a lake. There is emphasis on Robbie filming straight down into the water on a light, and he says he never wants to leave. He won\u2019t. END OF CARD 1\n\nG) 27:55 \u2013 Five mules stare at the group. They likely become pieces of the large Fused Beast seen later during The Nightmare. (KK, also K. This lettering was a coincidence, I promise)\n\nH) 30:20 \u2013 Group pitches some tens. Note, ladies tent is blue, guys is green.\n\nI) 32:40 \u2013 Robbie says he\u2019s going to \u201cthe lakebed\u201d (I will reference this area a few times later) and sees a faintly red figure in the distance, but does not comment on it, just sings \"La, La, La\" to the tune of the song Michelle sings IMPORTANT REMEMBER THE LA LA LA FOR LATER. This figure is himself, Axe-Robbie, having disemboweled and decapitated his friends, covered himself in blood, disemboweled himself, set the camera down, and is sundered off through the desert. Note the time of day, mountains in the background, and landscape of the lakebed Interestingly, The Light is already influencing the group, and it seems a time loop is present, wherein Robbie witnesses the final moments of Axe-Robbie, so when we see things from Axe-Robbie's perspective later in the film, it would follow that Robbie is in the distance on his way to becoming Axe-Robbie in a loop again and again (T, SS, TT).\n\nJ) 35:25 \u2013 THE AXE is seen on the hill, where Axe-Robbie will find it later and go on his spree. (V, PP)\n\nK) 36:35 \u2013 Coyotes howling, perhaps also animals that comprise the Fused Beast, given that many animals are shown, but we do not see any once we see the Fused Beast. (G, KK)\n\nL) 37:40 \u2013 The loud booming \u201cthunder\u201d begins. If we want to go with the nuclear testing theory, this could be the sound of the bombs \/ explosions that may have happened at some point in the past that disturbed\/unearthed The Light (remember, linear time means nothing, so the explosions could have happened in the past, but the sounds could be emanating now). Even if you don\u2019t subscribe to that theory, you do hear what appears to sound like actual thunder a few minutes later\u2026 AND the deep booming noise, they are two distinct noises so the booming is NOT just thunder as the group surmises (B, PP)\n\nM) 38:10 \u2013 Scott unzipping the tent, we see this later and more gruesome during The Nightmare (U, II)\n\nN) 42:30 \u2013 Robbie peers into The Light. The Light peers back.\n\nO) 43:20 \u2013 Robbie talks with Angela in the ladies tent regarding Michelle\u2019s strange nightmares about her mother, and the pair bicker.(AA, JJ, DD, P)\n\nP) 44:35 \u2013 Robbie talks to Michelle about the light, \u201cfolding in on itself\u201d and making \u201ca rip\u201d and \u201ca tear in the space in front of me\u201d. This is essentially what happens to time, as explained in section 2 above. Placing his mic in a hole near where he saw the light he gets a loud audio feedback. Remember this noise for later. The two talk about their nightmares (AA, DD, O, JJ)\n\nQ) 47:24 \u2013 Robbie and Michelle find a \u201cbig bullet shell\u201d. Possible nod to military\/nuclear testing theory (B, PP)\n\nR) 47:26 \u2013 They discuss a rattle snake, making a POINT of discussing the rattle. I believe this is a Red Herring, leading the viewer to believe these snakes have been altered by The Light into the red snake-like creatures that we catch glimpses of later (but they have no rattle). The truth of what those are, I believe, is not revealed until later in the film\u2026 (Y, Z, LL)\n\nS) 50:50 \u2013 Michelle dances and frolics through the lakebed for the music video shoot.\n\nT) 51:45 \u2013 Angela, Michelle, and Scott stand together, in a line, on the lake bed, at night. Note the order that they stand in\u2026 we get a variation of this scene later during the nightmare\u2026 (I,SS, TT) END OF CARD 2.\n\nU) 53:40 \u2013 Scott unzipping the tent to go outside due to the loud booming noises, an event repeated later during The Nightmare (M, II) \n\nV) 55:30 \u2013 Robbie sees himself to-be, Axe-Robbie, standing on a hill peering down on him. This is shortly AFTER Axe-Robbie has been told to \u201cshow them\u201d, but the viewer does not see this until much later. Axe-Robbie runs down the hill at attacks Robbie. THUNK. Robbie witnesses The Light briefly. Disoriented from the blow to his head, Robbie returns to the tents and comments to Angela that his \u201chead is raining\u201d. He lays down next to Scott. (J, PP)\n\nW) 57:07 \u2013 Axe-Robbie follows him and proceeds to torment the group. The first thing we see is a flash of blood in Robbie\u2019s tent and hear Scott\u2019s screams, as he is the first victim of Axe-Robbie (the only time we see Scott again is during The Nightmare sequence later when he repeats unzipping the tent for the first time, except covered in gore). We see Michelle run off, Robbie mumbles nonsense to himself (a side effect of his head injury, and\/or an effect of the perversion by The Light). We hear Michelle crying hysterically for her mother, and at 58:21 you hear a few axe blows and Michelle is silenced. She is second to die. (A, Z, HH)\n\nX) 1:01:12 - We catch an extremely brief glimpse of a naked Axe-Robbie going to town on someone (again, it\u2019s important that Axe-Robbie is naked), but he stops when he notices Robbie. Robbie runs forward into some gore and right into Angela and tries to comfort her \u201cshh, shh, shh\u201d while she screams \u201cwhat\u2019s happening?\u201d just like the opening 911 call. Call has been made at this point. She screams in pain and makes a point of looking down at her stomach and shrieking \u201coh my God!\u201d after witnessing her injuries. She begs Robbie not to leave, but he does. Angela either succumbs to her injuries, or Axe-Robbie returns to finish her off. It would seem from the gore seen in both tents (guys and girls) as well as Michelle\u2019s head (she runs off from the tent ,but her head ends up in the girls tent later) that Axe-Robbie does much of his work disemboweling and beheading the group\u2019s corpses inside the tents (A, Z, BB, PP, QQ)\n\nY) 1:04:15 \u2013 First glimpse of the red snake-like creatures. These are not snakes, they are the animated intestines of Robbie\u2019s murdered friends. We get some \u201cproof\u201d of this later when Robbie finds a mutilated Angela in her tent and he is \u201cattacked\u201d by tentacles resembling her intestines. Also implied by Robbie\u2019s obsession with disembowelment, including self-disembowelment at the film\u2019s end (LL, Z, R)\n\nZ) 1:07:40 \u2013 Robbie returns to the ladies tent which is covered in blood, and catches a glimpse of blonde hair (Michelle\u2019s head). This corroborates the theory that Michelle is killed second, offscreen while screaming for her mother not far away from the tents. Also implies that Axe-Robbie did much of his disemboweling and head-chopping in the tents (A, X, Y, LL)\n\nAA)  1:08:00 \u2013 Robbie speaks to his mother over the phone, who is having nightmares similar to the nightmares Robbie and Michelle were having. **Robbie undresses himself at this point, which is surprisingly important later**. Robbie\u2019s mom having similar nightmares may imply that The Light\u2019s influence is far beyond just the desert and may be affecting people in the city as well now that it has \u201cawoken\u201d or entered our reality. (O, PP, QQ) \n\nBB) 1:10:55 \u2013 Robbie sees naked Axe-Robbie\u2019s bloody feet stalking him (X, AA, FF, PP QQ)\n\nCC) 1:11:45 \u2013 Robbie stacks rocks for some reason, perhaps mimicking Michelle from earlier? (E)\n\nDD) 1:13:00 \u2013 Robbie sees The Light, sees tunnel vision and hears some loud screeching similar to when he placed the microphone inside the small tunnel\/rock cavity earlier (P)\n\nEE) 1:13:45 - Bloody water, and a heartbeat sound. Perhaps The Light is a living, breathing entity (u\/PockyClips theorizes in the comments that The Light is a portal a being uses to pass into our reality). Or perhaps it is the sound of Robbie\u2019s own heart thumping as he struggles in the water. Odd that his camera seems to be unaffected by being in the bloody water but I wont nitpick it much given the other loony things happening.\n\nFF) 1:14:48 Robbie vomits on his feet. He appears to pull\u2026 a layer of skin off his feet? He pulls SOMETHING off his feet, and I don\u2019t remember him wearing socks\u2026 he holds it and it looks like a fleshy membrane. The blood vomit is why Axe-Robbie has profusely bloody feet as shown in earlier scenes. (BB)\n\nGG) 1:17:07 Robbie sees the group of friends traversing the desert in the distance. He calls to them but they ignore him, or cannot hear him due to the intense wind, except for one figure in the back who stops briefly to look at him. One might argue that this is the figure Robbie video\u2019d in point (I). However, at that point Robbie was alone at the Lakebed, not with his friends in this desert area. As such, I conclude point\u2019s (I) and (TT) are connected, and this instance is its own thing.\n\nHH) 1:18:25 \u2013 Robbie discovers Michelle laying in the lakebed and she runs from him. This a scene replaying from when she was awoken in the night during Axe-Robbies initial attack. She's laying down, just like when she was laying down sleeping in her tent, and is startled awake by the sound of Axe-Robbie's attack and runs away. Robbie does not understand what is happening or why she is running from him. He begs her to come back, but she runs from him just like she did before. This is a glimpse of what the chase in the dark looked like before Michelle was killed offscreen (W)\n\nII) 1:22:00 \u2013 Scott wakes up in the guys tent from hearing the booming sound, both he and the tent covered in blood but he doesn\u2019t seem to notice the gory difference. He repeats the events that happened prior, where he goes to open the tent and investigate the noise. Robbie tries to warn him not to go, showing that he has retained SOME knowledge of what has occurred prior even if Scott doesn\u2019t. Likely attributed to Robbie being the one who saw The Light. (M, U)\n\nJJ) 1:25:00 \u2013 Robbie is all of the sudden home and his mom is sobbing. This is NOT a delusion because it is captured through the camera. Robbie actually IS home all of the sudden, made possible in The Nightmare where timing and location of events make no sense. He is then peering through the plane window at Scott, who he apologizes to as the plane flies off. We also see a strange sequence in which Robbie sees a female figure who speaks some gibberish about her daughter. I believe these were the nightmares that Robbie admitted to Michelle he had, or perhaps even Michelle\u2019s nightmares that Robbie is now experiencing as a side effect of The Light\u2019s tainting. These things are now REAL, and tangible, and no longer just in Robbie\u2019s or anyone else\u2019s heads (AA, O)\n\nKK) 1:29:30 \u2013 Robbie finds a large creature that appears to be an combination of all the animals from desert (definitely the donkeys, perhaps the coyotes and birds and such as well, which would make sense as we were shown two scenes of coyote howling and birds and bats flying a few times). It wails horrifically in pain. I wish we saw more. The size of the beast definitely APPEARS to be larger than just the size of five fused donkey\u2019s so I believe the Fused Beast is an amalgamation of ALL the desert animals. We do not see the animals again once we witness the Fused Beast (other than the Intesti-Snakes in the next scene), and I don't believe we hear much in the way of animal noise either... and it lends some \"point\" to the scenes prior where we listen to all the animal sounds in the desert. They are one, now, as the Fused Beast (G, K)\n\nLL) 1:31:45 \u2013 Robbie is in the blue tent with Angela (blonde hair is seen on the floor, presumably Michelle\u2019s corpse, or at least her head) and the pair are attacked by the snake-like creatures that I believe to be the group\u2019s animated intestines. (R, Y, Z)\n\nMM) 1:34:00 \u2013 Now A MUCH complained about and confusing scene **because we, the viewer, do not witness the original version of this scene**. Robbie is in Angela\u2019s tent. Angela all of the sudden is nude, saying Robbie\u2019s name over and over with a devilish grin on her face, moaning, and is touching herself while covered in gore. This, too, is a repeated scene. I speculate that this is a replaying of Angela and Robbie hooking up at Robbie\u2019s apartment when they partied earlier in the movie. Just like Scott does in the scene shortly before this in point (II), Angela begins acting out things that happened before, seemingly unaware of the grotesque differences between then and now (and we know events that happened outside of the desert can happen now since Robbie sees his mother\u2019s house and the airplane). We, the audience, do not witness the original encounter because of course sane Robbie does not video tape their illicit affair, which makes this scene seem random and confusing to the audience. However, this time he does record, and their affair is revealed to us in a horrifying manner. (D)\n\nNN) 1:35:00 \u2013 The big moment! Robbie finds the axe and he, along with the audience, hear the voice. \u201cShow them\u201d. It is at this point Robbie becomes full-fledged Axe-Robbie. I believe what Robbie is meant to \u201cShow them\u201d is essentially a concept out of Lovecraftian lore, where a human witnesses a being so beyond their own comprehension it complete deconstructs their mind and they act in inconceivable ways believing they are enlightening or elevating the existence of themselves or others. In this case, the thing beyond comprehension is The Light, and by witnessing it Robbie has been exposed to something he cannot grasp, cannot truly quantify (though he tries, \"the sky opened up... the sky opened up\"), and he is powerless to be a pawn in whatever end it seeks (in this case, it seems, ritualistic mutilation and the corruption of flesh, as seen with our group's fate, the Intesti-Snakes, and the state of the Fused Beast. Ritualistic sacrifice is a common method of appeasement with regard to cosmic\/lovecraftian dieties). Again, allow me to state that the events ARE NOT JUST IN ROBBIES MIND, or else the camera could not have captured them. Having witnessed The Light Robbie is the vessel for its will, and all the things he sees, experiences, and does are very real. Robbie will show them. He is powerless to resist. Lovecraft would be proud, no?\n\nOO) 1:36:00 \u2013 We go into an extended light show, captured by the camera. Perhaps this is what Robbie meant when he says \u201cthe sky opened up\u201d. Perhaps it is the inner workings of The Light?  We will probably never truly know. But what we do know is this is what Robbie witnesses right after being told to \u201cshow them\u201d and right before he goes on his killing spree, thus it is indicative in some way of The Light's form or influence. (Credit u\/PockyClips for introducing a theory that The Light may be Yog-Sloloth, a Great One from HP Lovecraft described as \"malignant orbs\" and referenced in other works related to tentacles and time loops)\n\nPP) 1:38:00 \u2013 Here, I believe we get a bit of a perspective swap. VERY IMPORTANT and probably the most debatable portion of my theories but hear me out between this point and point QQ below. Before the light show, we witnessed the moment that Robbie became Axe-Robbie (\u201cShow them\u201d). After the light show the perspective switches back to regular Robbie, reeling, having just gotten thwacked in the head from Axe-Robbie (you hear the footsteps and axe thwack as the light show ends). REMEMBER, both versions of Robbie exist simultaneously. Robbie looks down from the blow and finds the restricted area sign and gas mask, lending to the nuclear testing theory as the possible reason The Light was disturbed\/awoken. This is also a Red Herring to make viewers believe that perhaps radiation or a biological weapon of some sort drove the characters mad and perhaps it was all in their head. Remember, however, that the camera captured the events. If the characters were just loony from some sort of radiological poisoning, the camera couldn\u2019t have captured it. (B, V, J, X, AA, QQ)\n\nQQ) 1:39:00 \u2013 Robbie stumbles over to Axe-Robbie, who is kneeling down NAKED (another indication that perspective swapped at 1:38:00 after the light show. Regular Robbie was likely clothed at the point that Axe-Robbie first attacked him, as we see Robbie undress when he gets the call from his mother later on AFTER the initial attack). Axe-Robbie is clutching the axe, shaking and clearly disturbed trying to process that he just attacked\u2026himself... Meanwhile Robbie is a bit hysterical from his wound also (we know this from earlier scenes when he goes back to the tent and says \u201cmy head is raining\u201d which is not how anyone of sound mind would communicate that they had a massive injury) and cant quite remember his own name at this point. \u201cHi, I\u2019m\u2026 Me\u201d. At one point earlier in the film he tries very hard to remember his own name and DOES recall that he is Robbie (I forgot timestamp of that). Axe-Robbie approaches him and swings the axe, Robbie runs. Note the tone of Robbie\u2019s voice when he says \u201cHi, I\u2019m\u2026 Me\u201d. It is the same shaky tone he uses when he conveys that his \u201chead is raining\u201d and \u201cthe sky opened up\u201d as he lays down next to Scott. So I conclude that, at 1:38:00 after the light show we have a perspective swap from Axe-Robbie back to Robbie. (PP, B, J, V, X, AA)\n\nRR) 1:39:17 \u2013 Perspective cuts back to Axe-Robbie running over the lakebed and we see a glimpse of the stakes. At this point, Axe-Robbie has already killed Scott, Michelle, and Angela, disemboweled and beheaded them in the tents, and carried their heads to the lakebed.\n\nSS) 1:40:15 \u2013 We see the impaled heads of Robbie\u2019s friends on stakes, in the same exact order as the way they were standing at the end of Card 2 (T). So once again, a scene repeats, just in a much more horrific way. In the same way that Robbie sings \"La La La\" as he views bloody Axe-Robbie in the distance in point (I), Axe-Robbie sings La, La, La as he views Michelle's head, further suggesting that Robbie witnesses his \"future\" fate as Axe-Robbie in point (I), and further reinforces the time loop (I, T, TT)\n\nTT) 1:41:24 \u2013 If you saw the movie you know what happens next, Robbie cuts off a certain appendage, carves his legs up, disembowels himself, sets the camera down, and sunders of through the desert. Notice the time of day an orientation. With the mountains to his left, that would place Robbie off in the distance to his right, catching a glimpse of his \u201cfuture\u201d self (La, La, La) Axe-Robbie, bloody and stumbling off across the lake bed, and so the loop continues.  (I,SS).\n\nTL:DR \n\n\nIn an effort to form a cohesive timeline\/follow the loop of Robbie becoming Axe-Robbie, it would seem to occur as such\n\n1) Axe-Robbie attacks Robbie, wounding his head\n\n2) Robbie lays down in his tent with Scott\n\n3) Axe-Robbie attacks and kills Scott. Robbie, Michelle and Angela run\n\n4) Axe-Robbie catches Michelle, kills her while she screams for her mother\n\n5) Robbie interrupts Axe-Robbie attacking Angela, which causes Axe-Robbie to run off before finishing the job. She appears mortally wounded however, or at the very least, Axe-Robbie finishes the job once Robbie leaves her (in spite of her begging him to stay).\n\n6) Axe-Robbie finishes disemboweling and beheading the group in the tents (likely all post-mortem), which is how both tents end up completely drenched in blood and why we see Michelle's head in the tent later. \n\n7) Axe-Robbie runs the heads to the lakebed and sets them up on stakes\n\n8) Axe-Robbie mutilates himself and wanders off to (presumably) die\n\n9) Meanwhile Robbie, having peered into The Light, is amidst his journey through The Nightmare on his way to becoming Axe-Robbie.\n\n10) After experiencing a relentless stream of bizarre events, Robbie is commanded by a voice to \u201cShow them.\u201d He picks up the Axe and becomes Axe-Robbie\n\n11) Back to step 1)\n\nOf course it doesn\u2019t flow perfectly linearly like this \\^\\^\\^ but it\u2019s about as close as we can probably get to arranging the major events\/deaths in some sort of \u201cnormal\u201d linear take on time as we know it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSO..... what do you all think?

A female vampire working as an assassin for hire.

Basically it's a gothic horror film set in the modern day. A busload of tourists have their bus breakdown, as buses in horror films tend to do, near a weird castle that has a curse upon it, as weird castles in horror films tend to do. As the film goes on, two things become apparent. First, the seven travelers each personify one of the seven deadly sins (with gluttony, wrath, and lust being the most obvious ones, whereas sloth and envy honestly come off kinda forced). Second, they are being killed off one by one by a beautiful\/evil succubus. This definitely made for a fun viewing experience as you don't see the seven deadly sins utilized much (aside from Seven, of course) and you also don't tend to see the succubus variant of the vampire. There's definitely a slasher vibe to the proceedings and the ending, without spoiling too much, was very \"fuck you\"in a way that made me cheer. I would definitely recommend to anyone who's into 70s european horror and feels like they've already seen mostly everything. There's definitely familiar elements at play here; a cast of characters consisting of overly horny, greedy, shitty people (just like as in any giallo of the time), the femme fatale vampire, the ruined castle, an occult vibe, but I can't recall any other film putting them all together in the same way this one does. \n\nHas anyone else seen this?","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678573204.0},{"title":"What's your favourite non-English language horror films?","author":"NearbyOrangutan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11osc76\/whats_your_favourite_nonenglish_language_horror\/","text":"I'd like to recommend Poochandi (2022, Tamil) and Kumari (2022, Malayalam).

I thought it may have been Maniac (1980) since it's about a guy scalping women but then realized he does all his killings with a knife rather than a saw. \n\n2) This might be 00s and I am almost sure it is from a franchise since I recall wanting to see others in the series. Towards the end, a girl is captured in something like a saw mill and she is tied up in a bikini (or underwear?) and jean shorts. Was almost certain this was Wrong Turn 2 but no, and doesn't seem to be any of the sequels either. The scene is similar to one in Tucker & Dale vs Evil but the girl is sitting up rather than lying down and more scantily clad. Some other hillbilly horror franchise that I'm missing? Also seem to recall that this was the second movie in the franchise but could be wrong. EDIT: REST STOP 2\n\n3) Finally, not sure if this is 80s or 90s but there's a scene in one of the characters (male) goes into an attic and is confronted by a creepy elderly woman wearing a typical grandma nightgown who suddenly jumps on him in a supernatural way and nails his arms and legs to the ground very quickly.

I saw \u201cEli & Mary, sins paid in full\u201d but the underneath all I could make out was \u201cJosiah\u201d and \u201cdance\u201d. \n\n\n2) at the beginning of Chapter II, when the cop handcuffs Eli, Eli says something like \u201cGo ahead and toss it\u201d and nods toward the trailer. Um\u2026 did he mean what I think he meant and the cop did what I think he did?\n\n3) During the Gypsy reading does she say \u201cYou not save her\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re not safe here\u201d ? My subtitles said the first one, but if that\u2019s true did she mean the little girl or Mary? Also,  why did she speak English all of a sudden?\n\n4) And why did the Gypsy appear between his legs during the trip? Lmao, so random. \n\n5) What song was playing on the alarm clock that caused Eli to smash it? I\u2019m assuming the same one at the end that was Pa\u2019s favorite, but I could barely make it out. \n\n6) What did Mary stop and look at in the supermarket? It was a bunch of kitchen utensils but I couldn\u2019t tell what we were supposed to be focusing on. Maybe the knives? She had a fixation with knives, like her dream we saw Ross chopping the apple with similar knives. \n\nAnd, finally, my take on the movie: I think that Josiah was less a figment of Tommy\u2019s imagination and more of a ghost\/spirit. He even appeared to Mary at the end. I don\u2019t think Eli and Mary were banging and I\u2019m basing that on Mary\u2019s demeanor toward Eli when he showed up to her house in Chapter III. I think Josiah blamed the pregnancy on Eli to the mom and that\u2019s part of why she hung herself. This also ties up why the Gypsy blamed the moms death on Eli. I think Eli and Mary probably were close, like a lot of twins. Josiah might have diddled them all, and because of that they all grew up with lingering issues. I\u2019m basing that on Tommy\u2019s reaction when Josiah went to touch him (by far, one of the most disturbing scenes I\u2019ve ever seen), and Josiah saying that Eli showed Tommy how to jerk off. \n\nIn the end, Eli was right. Josiah was there to exact revenge. \n\nThere\u2019s probably more thoughts I\u2019ll remember and come back to edit later.

I am running a session of Dungeons and Dragons tonight, and want to incorporate some horror elements.\n\nThe scenario will be billed as a heist to break into a trading depot for a consortium of arms dealers to steal all the gold they can carry. Think Pirates of the Caribbean + cheesy fantasy.\n\nThe players arrive at the compound, and there are bodies nailed roughly to the wall, all around the perimeter. That is the first indication things have gone awry. The compound was overtaken by a cult\/rabble fanatics trying to find a tomb underneath one of the buildings and release some dark entity therein.\n\nMechanics are easy, and the general structure is still a heist - there are patrols, rabid dogs, a mechanic for how aware of their presence the cultists are (essentially a threat level), and when\/if they find the tomb I can handle that too.\n\nWhat I need is more window-dressing. What kind of horrible sights, what eldritch anomalies, can I throw in to increase the tension? Gore is fine, but I want more than gratuitous gore. Something to do with human depravity, and the psychological breakdown of the players' characters (are they seeing things, or are those shadows moving?), but also this is now desecrated ground and supernatural shit is definitely going on. \n\nThoughts so far:\n1-2 dead cultists will get back up, and Stranger Things style their bodies will float, break, and rearrange into a sinister looking monster of visceral flesh and broken bones. They will also encounter several bodies hanging by their feet with their abdomens' opened, the implication being they are ready for butchering. Last idea I have is a tea party set up in one of the buildings, or a couple of dudes playing cards, except that this is just a fucked up tableau of corpses (inspired by the similar thing in an episode of Narcos).\n\nSo.

So I'd have this story (whether it be a film, a comic, a TV series, etc.) be set sometime from the 1950s to the present.\n\nI'd write Dracula himself as being quiet, calculating and extremely patient. During the day he's a mortal human who is unaffected by holy items. At night he gains all his powers and any sickness or injuries sustained during the day are instantly healed. His healing factor makes him immortal during the night and only holy items can repel him. Rather than being Vlad the Impaler, his age is left ambiguous but it's hinted he's from the Roman era and he's taken on many identities. Over the centuries he's studied a wide variety of subjects such as science, languages and dark magic. For example he can reanimate corpses as mind-controlled zombies. In order to read someone's mind though they have to let him in but he's very persuasive. Every month the people living near his castle draw blood from themselves which he collects. When hunting people he'll sometimes give them a fighting chance to make it more fun and challenging for him.\n\nRenfield and Harker are sent together to Dracula's castle as their boss thinks it's good experience for the intelligent but young and inexperienced Harker to go with the older more experienced Renfield. Renfield is pretty unpleasant but is too good at his job to be fired. When they arrive at Dracula's castle the place and its titular host seem normal and pleasant enough but as they spend more time there Dracula's true nature is slowly revealed. Harker tries to rationalise it but Renfield quickly catches on and immediately sucks up to Dracula. Dracula leaves Harker in his castle and takes Renfield (who rather than being driven insane, follows Dracula willingly) with him to England. In this version they travel by train.\n\nHarker is rescued by vampire hunters Van Helsing and Quincey and the trio set out in pursuit of Dracula. Helsing hunts vampires for the threat they pose, Quincey hunts them because he loves the thrill of the hunt. Dracula's brides tell Dracula about Harker's escape and he sends loyal agents throughout Europe after them. While they're able to evade Dracula's agents, they are significantly slowed down by them so by the time they return to England Dracula has been there for days and has started cultivating a power base. Not sure how I'd progress the story from there.\n\nOn a side note one idea I've thought of is that Lucy is Van Helsing's niece who growing up enjoyed her uncle's tales of monsters but is shocked to realise he was telling the truth about them.\n\nPlease give me your thoughts and suggestions.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678547569.0},{"title":"Smile vs the nighthouse???","author":"DeskAdministrative42","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11om0tv\/smile_vs_the_nighthouse\/","text":"Have a free afternoon without the missus who hates horror, these 2 seem good which one I better if you had to choose?  \n\nalso open to other similar reccomendations of really disturbing\/scary films if u have any","upvote_ratio":0.55,"created_utc":1678546207.0},{"title":"What if Jason saved the final girl?","author":"godspilla98","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11olcnt\/what_if_jason_saved_the_final_girl\/","text":"It\u2019s as simple as that he comes out of the woods an whacked his own mom for neglect.

In some cases though, the shadow won't have enough strength to separate from the host, acting on their own but unable to cause any harm due to the nature of the host and shadow's connection, while in other cases, the shadow will have excess strength, and rather than separating, it will be able to completely take over the host's body, everything appearing the same aside from the lack of speech, thought, and attached shadow. \n\nThe only way for the shadows to separate from their host is by killing them, and sometimes the shadows that have taken over their host sneak into survivor settlements hiding as one of them, only to take them all out from the inside if they are not noticed in time.\n\nAgain, I'm really sorry if this doesn't fit the rules and guidelines in any way, but this is the only place I found that could be appropriate to ask for this sort of advice. \n\nIf this doesn't fit in this sub, I'll happily delete my post, just please tell me instead of acting like it's obvious that this is the wrong subreddit  (speaking from experience) :\\]","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678519803.0},{"title":"Friday the 13th Part 5","author":"ChrisGregoryT","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11op5g8\/friday_the_13th_part_5\/","text":"\n(SPOILERS)\nFriday the 13th Part 5, also known as Friday the 13th: A New Beginning, was released in 1985,  it's the fifth installment of the iconic horror franchise. The movie was directed by Danny Steinmann and starred John Shepherd, Melanie Kinnaman, and Shavar Ross.\nThe movie starts with Tommy Jarvis, the protagonist from the previous installment, being transferred to a mental health facility after being released from a psychiatric hospital. However, he soon witnesses the murder of another patient, and he suspects that Jason Voorhees, the infamous killer, is back. But the murders continue, and it's unclear who the killer really is.\nUnlike the previous films, Friday the 13th Part 5 features a new killer and a different approach to the storytelling. Instead of focusing solely on Jason Voorhees, the movie introduces a copycat killer who mimics Jason's modus operandi. This decision was controversial among fans of the franchise,  but I think it was a clever way to continue a storyline that was increasingly hard to believe.\nThe movie also features a new group of characters, including the troubled teenager Tommy Jarvis, who becomes the main suspect in the murders, and a group of troubled teenagers who are sent to a halfway house to receive therapy. The characters are not particularly well-developed, and their interactions feel forced and predicative and in some cases outright goofy.\nThe movie's violence and gore are on par with the previous installments, featuring gruesome murders and graphic scenes of violence. \nCritics and audiences were mostly negative towards Friday the 13th Part 5, with many criticizing the lack of Jason Voorhees and the subpar writing and acting. The movie currently holds a 16% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is considered one of the weakest entries in the franchise.\nThis movie is what I like to refer to as \u201cParty Horror\u201d. It\u2019s really only good for watching with a group of friends so that you can drink and make fun of the movie. Even with that in mind there are much better Party Horror movies in the franchise.

I love the movie both in a way that I appreciate how it defined the genre, and that it still holds in so many ways. Norman Bates is my favorite fictional killer. \n\n\nI didn\u2019t watch the sequels because I initially thought it didn\u2019t make sense to pay attention to them, after all Hitchcock had nothing to do with them. But the fact that Anthony Perkins was still there was a valid reason, he even directed the 3rd one. Although I normally don\u2019t care much about actors, this is one case where the portrayal of the character was so strong that no remakes or alternate takes will ever make sense. \n\n\nThe sequels have great and shit elements about them, but overall I\u2019d say their existence is justified. It\u2019s kind of like a well written fanfiction by someone who really gets the character and respects the work, but doesn\u2019t necessarily have the best story to put him in. They\u2019re  enjoyable if you want to see more of the character but also don\u2019t want to watch the original work getting raped just to keep dragging it on. For the most part, at least. \n\n\n**Psycho 2** - the premise is actually very interesting to me. I like true crime and you often see arguments between people who can sympathize with some murderers vs people who think families deserve justice which can only be given through absolute punishments. Here, Bates spent a long time in an institution, is now cured and gets released. I personally think that is fair, because he was a victim too. But Lila, Marion Crane\u2019s sister and ex wife of Sam Loomis, disagrees. \n\n\nHer stance should be understandable to many, but at what point does a victim looking for justice become a villain on a quest for revenge? Here, there\u2019s not much ambiguity there. Lila is mental. She turned into a bitter woman who puts up a fucked up plan to make Bates lose his sanity again, even throwing her own daughter into the equation which is interesting if she really thinks he\u2019s so dangerous. Clearly her motivation is just to ruin his life at all cost, so it\u2019s impossible to sympathize with her especially when Perkins again portrays Bates as a very likable and sympathetic character who is just dealing with a lot of shit. \n\n\nI liked that some other characters including the sheriff took Bates\u2019 side, that was refreshing. They represent people who believe in the second chance and take a more sympathetic view of the situation. \n\n\nLila\u2019s daughter, Mary Loomis, was an ok character too for the most part, a genuinely caring girl who pretty quickly refused to continue with her mom\u2019s plans, which pushed Lila even further into madness. It was interesting that the relationship between her and Bates remained undefined as he slipped back into madness just as they were getting closer. There is one moment where he actually asks her why she ended up helping him, like is there more to her feelings than just doing the right thing, and then the scene gets interrupted. I would say there was more to her feelings, but it is good that it went unexplored because that is part of the tragedy of his character (to be continued in Psycho 3) \n\n\nNow the bad parts - while the Lila storyline has a really solid premise, it becomes a bit underexplored and instead of properly developing that tension, a third side to the story is introduced as Emma Spool, Norman\u2019s \u201creal\u201d mother. This whole storyline is ridiculous for many reasons. \n\n\nIf she was so obsessed with getting her son back, why didn\u2019t she approach him when he was institutionalized? When he comes to work in the diner with her, she barely reacts or tries to establish any connection with him, wouldn\u2019t she want to do this leading up to her confession? Why is she invading his house secretly and killing people? Apparently she tries to protect him but if it wasn\u2019t for Mary giving him an alibi and Mary attacking him at the end, he would have been arrested again over her shit. And then she calls him on the phone and apparently convincingly makes the case that she\u2019s his real mother in just a few seconds. Yeah sure.\n\n\nPlus, it just doesn\u2019t work, Norma Bates is such an important character that adding a new mother makes no sense,  especially someone who has absolutely no established relationship with Norman.\n\n\nI get why he kills her and falls back into the setting he had before, with her corpse watching from the top room. It\u2019s psychologically sound, because another interesting point that the movie brought up was that just curing him from the influence and memories of his mother didn\u2019t work, because there was nothing to replace that superego role with. He was cured but his psyche had no frame of reference that would give rules and shape to his life, so you can understand how he feels at ease again by placing the mother back in that role, literally having her looking out from the top window making sure he follows her structure. \n\n\nWhat I think should have happened is that Lila who already broke him should have simply continued playing Norma to the point where he accepts that she\u2019s back, kills Lila and then puts her there. Even his \u201cdialogues\u201d with mother simply follow the same Norma pattern so Emma Spool makes no sense. \n\n\nI\u2019d truly love to remake this movie because I think it has much potential and could explore the themes it started in a deeper way without the distractions, on the other hand Anthony Perkins again put a perfect portrayal of Bates which can\u2019t be repeated. He does the character justice, the ending scene is epic, and with all the flaws, it was a good watch (6.5\/10)\n\n\n**Psycho 3** - The biggest problem about this movie is that it's stuck with the shit Emma Spool storyline with some new additions, namely she isn\u2019t the real mother, she was just stuck in the love triangle with his real mother\/her sister. And this information is supposed to be very important but it just isn\u2019t, I mean who cares, the mother was always Norma and this whole background plot doesn\u2019t change anything for Norman so I didn\u2019t understand the whole \u201cinvestigative reporting\u201d storyline that went into it. \n\n\nMy problem with this movie were the very annoying supporting characters who took way too much attention without adding anything. E.g.  the reporter - she is obnoxious as fuck, completely irrelevant to the story that unfolds, and didn\u2019t deserve her role at the end. This actually pissed me off, she should have been killed. Or she should have been more involved and written differently, maybe the character of Maureen should have been a blend between Maureen and the reporter in some way to keep the story tighter. \n\n\nMaybe there is something interesting to say about the role reporters play in these cases, but that angle wasn\u2019t explored here at all so she just wasn\u2019t needed aside from leading the investigation that will provide this fascinating new info about Emma Spool no one cares about, which doesn\u2019t affect anyone in any way; and as an \u201cI told you so\u201d character who is convinced Bates is bad despite town people believing in him. The ending makes me so bitter because this bitch not only survives but feels like she was in the right, and she\u2019s like the least sympathetic character you can imagine. Also, Norma and Emma both lived in this small town with like 20 people in it, you seriously needed a journalist to dig out a story about a murder-kidnap love triangle cause no one remembered this?\n\n\nThe main premise that got watered down with these side characters is what happens when an insane person meets another insane person, and can they find love together? This is a good premise, and I wish it went even further \n\n\nNorman as Norma wants to kill her only to find that she slit her wrists in the bathtub which snaps him out of the madness and gets him to help her. She falls for him and accepts his past (another super annoying moment when the journalist believed that Maureen would change her mind if only she saw the article about Emma Spool - wtf? No one fucking cares about Emma Spool.) He falls for her too, which leads to very interesting inner struggle between him and \u201cNorma\u201d (yeah I\u2019m not going to say Emma Spool fuck that). \n\n\nThere is also an incredibly sad and depressing scene where he could have had sex with Maureen but can\u2019t go through with it, you really feel so bad for the guy and how much his mom and the world took from him. It\u2019s beyond sad and very well performed. That there is real horror. \n\n\n\nNow the ultimate stupidity - Maureen dies by accident and the final conflict is between Norman and the reporter, and then Norman fights off Norma by figuratively \u201ckilling\u201d Emma\u2019s corpse all over again. What the fuck, that should have been done for Maureen and not for the idiot reporter who fully deserved to die. \n\nIn the end, Norman is arrested and on his way to be institutionalized for life, which I see as a very unsatisfying ending. He proclaims he is at least finally free but he also somehow still holds the fake mother's corpse hand so clearly not, a moment that really makes no sense. I\u2019m not demanding happy endings at all cost even though I'd want one for him, but this was not a good ending. The ending in Psycho 2 was not a happy ending but it was strong (not to mention the original), but here I had the feeling the movie actually wants the viewer to see it as a good thing that he gets locked up and that the reporter was right and survived, cause see, he really is dangerous. And all you feel is sympathy for him and how he pretty much deserves freedom if you take into account how much everyone messed with his life and sanity. \n\n\nAnyway, the movie would have been better if the whole focus was on the love story (I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this because I hate romance, but this is like one time romance can be interesting), if it went really deep into exploring if two people like that could save each other, or if they\u2019re too fucked up to ever be ok. If Maureen was more consequential and competent (more like Mary before the very end of Psycho 2) and through her we got even more insight into Norman\u2019s backstory - for example in Psycho 2 he mentions his mom was a sweet person once before going mad. This makes you want to know more. He is the main character for a reason, the viewer should learn more about his past that is the most fascinating story after all, and not some Emma Spool nonsense. It should end either with them getting together but knowing that it could turn bad any time (kind of like a romantic Babadook), or tragically with him killing her and finally giving up (I\u2019d prefer the first option.) \n\n\nI still thought it was worth watching just to see the story continue, his character was still good, the look and feel was there, but it could have been a much better story. (6.5\/10 but the type that left me pissed off and depressed in the end)\n\n\nTl;dr - both Psycho sequels had some interesting ideas that warrant their existence, but got sidetracked with poor storylines thrown into the mix. There\u2019s a lot of lost potential there. However, the portrayal of Norman Bates remains perfect and the sequels don\u2019t shit on the legacy. They were made respectfully and with a good sense for the tone of the story and the protagonist. But fuck Emma Spool.","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678522166.0},{"title":"Watched Scream (1996) yesterday and was pleasantly surprised!","author":"DarkRythm8520","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11odocg\/watched_scream_1996_yesterday_and_was_pleasantly\/","text":"So yesterday I watched the original Scream with my friend.

She ends up following the light from the hallucination up an incline where it turns out to be light from the outside. She emerges in a lake.\n\nNow imagine my surprise to find that people on Reddit think the movie follows the US ending. How is that possible? Did they all miss the first few minutes like the people who claim to have watched the Lost finale yet think the characters were dead the whole time? Did I imagine it?\n\nNo. A little while ago I found this on IMDb:\n\nThe original draft of the script featured an alternative opening, which would have addressed the inconsistency between the different versions of the first film (the U.S. version omits the final scene, where it is revealed that Sarah's escape from the cave was a hallucination). The opening scene would have shown Sarah following a vision of her daughter into an abyss and ending up in a lake that would take her outside the cave. This explains why the dog used to trace Sarah's steps later in the film stops at the lake, rather than the side of a mountain as per the ending of the U.S. version of the first movie.\n\n\nIt doesn't seem like they ever filmed that...but it exactly describes what I remember. I know memory is fallible, and it's possible that if I'd read that years agou brain could be telling me I *watched* it....except I didn't read it then. I went into this movie totally blind and never read anything about it afterwards.\n\nSo does anyone know if there's a version of it with that opening?

But there's suspicion as to whether the survivor is responsible for the murders. \n\nThere's a slow burn getting to the skin crawling climax, but the directors insert a lot of chilling segments to keep you satisfied and enthralled with what's going on.

The piano is followed by a hissing hi-hat that seems to be spitting its disapproval of the piano's bold opening. The piano then repeats its inquisitive and stuttering opening, ignoring the cymbals' interruption, and is  joined by a bass guitar. Meanwhile the cymbals repeat their percussive warnings, but they are ignored; the buildup and anticipation then explodes into a hypnotic melody as the crystalline serenity of the pool's surface is completely wrecked by a resounding splash, sending waves and water droplets spreading in every direction.\n\nThe singer's staccato matches the opening piano notes, and like the piano he sounds hesitant at first but then rises in pitch and intensity to match the musical maelstrom that has been unleashed and is now spreading in concentric circles of rhythmic waves emanating from the epicenter of the canonball entry. After a few energetic minutes of splashing in the water, the music fades until it is once again replaced by smooth silence. But we all know that the serenity is only temporary; the piano is about to break the water's surface again. And again. And again.\n\nSo... yeah, if I was driving across the country and had to listen to one song on repeat, it would be this one, and I know I wouldn't get sick of it.\n\nWhat's your favorite song from a horror movie soundtrack?","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678375906.0},{"title":"Possom - Is the Puppet visually based off of Philip?","author":"c_draws","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11n76l8\/possom_is_the_puppet_visually_based_off_of_philip\/","text":"Recently watched Possum, and I thought it was great, haunting, but great.

My expectations were very low, given it came out in 2019 and I barely heard a peep about it since. I thought the atmosphere was pretty good- the acting and pace left a LOT to be desired. There was zero chemistry whatsoever between Jason Clarke and Amy Seimetz. They are supposed to be pretty happily married in the beginning and its just cold and flat from the start. Particularly Seimetz- she was very cold and aloof. Almost like she didn't want to be there. I think the movie was slow enough as it is, but there could have been more endearing and thoughprovoking scenes between Louis and Ellie if they didn't choose to kill off Ellie instead of Gage. Gage is a literal toddler, and isn't capable of understanding death so we lose any nuance we could have had with Ellie's understanding of death. Also, a malicious killer toddler to ME is more frightening than a creepy little girl.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID- when they did bring back Ellie from beyond, I thought all the scenes with her were very well done and quite creepy. The eye sagging (whether just a quirk of the actress or some kind of effect) was effective and the scene where he's tucking \"her\" into bed and she's just staring like a corpse is pretty damn creepy. The practical gore was very very well done, in particular the Pascow scene. The Wendigo was a nice touch. \n\nI will give this movie a 5\/10 since I have nothing better to do on this midnight shift.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1678349591.0},{"title":"Virus (1999)","author":"ChaotixEDM","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11mka35\/virus_1999\/","text":"This movie is criminally underrated.

I got a lot of recommendations for lesser known horrors and created a list, these are the first three I watched. This includes spoilers:\n\n**Road Games  (1981)** - I really like these middle of nowhere road movies, I watched the Hitcher around the same time too so I liked how the vibe continued. The main character is very likable, well-written and acted. He has a dingo who doesn't get hurt in the movie, and the atmosphere is great. There's also Jaime Lee Curtis there though I can't say she did much for me. The actual story is pretty straight forward and the villain isn't very fleshed out the way for instance Ryder is in The Hitcher, but that's not necessarily an issue. The tone is not too serious without ruining it with comedy. It's a fun and entertaining watch, nothing hardcore but I recommend it when you're in the mood for something well written and not too dark, but with a realistic premise that creates good tension. (7.5\/10)\n\n\n**Long Weekend (1987)** - this movie is told from the point of view of the villains. A psychopathic, deranged, murderous couple on a long weekend determined to destroy all life around them out of incompetence, ignorance or random malice. They also hate each other. Eventually the nature fights back and manages to survive with great losses, so the good does prevail. \n\nTechnically I should hate this movie because seeing animals die is very hard for me. The movie is also a trip into the psyche of two most mundanely vile and obnoxious characters and their relationship. It's hard to tell who is worse - the wife is a whiney, stupid moron who never does anything but complain about every situation she's in. She hates everything and sulks all the time. The husband seems like a better and less annoying one, except for his inexplicable urge to run around creating orphans out of animals, chopping trees for no obvious reason and running over things. The best thing is that the couple despises each other, and both sides often call the other out pretty accurately and insightfully while being very hypocritical at the same time. \n\nEven though all this doesn't sound like a fun experience, it's actually a very good movie somehow. The main fear it plays on in my opinion isn't nature but rather a certain type of women and relationships in general (7.5\/10) \n\n\n**Wake In Fright (1971)** - I both appreciate and hate this one. Since I watch so much horror, I am able to deal with animals dying on screen although I really hate those scenes, and I try to not let them make me think less of a movie. Nothing else bothers me in horrors. I like to be edgy and think that I'm good with everything, it gives me a dumb sense of pride.\n\nBut the animal brutality that happened here really mentally fucked me up, I don't know last time anything was so hard to watch. Also, I repeated to myself that it's just a movie, just to get to the end and read that the scenes were real. With respect to the intent behind it, the scenes were taken from an actual kangaroo hunt and the message at the end wants to bring attention to this issue, but for fucks sake seeing that..\n\nWhat's up with Australians randomly shooting animals?\n\nAnyway, back to the movie. Aside from that part, I like the story, it's a drunk nightmare of bad decisions and what you get when you're staying with Australian rednecks who can only drink beer instead of water and you're drunk 24\/7. The main character is just making very bad decisions every step of the way and is just as much of a moron as the others. There's no real villain, it's more of a drunk trip and in that way it's pretty original. As a viewer you also feel kind of stuck and like you just want to be somewhere else. \n\nI'd say it's objectively a very good movie, but I didn't enjoy watching it at all (7\/10)","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1678270125.0},{"title":"horror with death metal in the soundtrack","author":"fannypack666","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11l16fn\/horror_with_death_metal_in_the_soundtrack\/","text":"I've always wondered if any films incorporated death metal or something similar into the soundtrack.

I don\u2019t generally pay attention to reviews for the horror genre, but if it receives a decent scoring on RT, I\u2019ll tend to give it a shot. I don\u2019t really dislike horror movies to begin with. Even the really terrible ones, I tend to have a good time with regardless.\n\n___\n\nI\u2019m a bit of a sucker for a good slow burn. Something didn\u2019t feel right, however, when after the first 40 minutes had surpassed and absolutely nothing had happened. Not even an inkling of the bizarre. Saying that, this has me even more invested for when the inevitable leads to the unbelievable. A strobe light appears.\n\nWe see a stranger looking out over the camp, but only from his darkened silhouette, outlined by the fading horizon. Something terrible is about to happen. Finally, all that buildup is about to pay off. There were footsteps and then, \u201cI\u2019m raining from my head.\u201d\n\nWhat follows is 10 unsullied minutes of pure darkness. Not tonally, not narratively; literal black on the cinema screen. \u201cWow, they\u2019re really stretching this scene out.\u201d I remember thinking to myself, \u201cMust be an artistic thing they\u2019re going for.\u201d People are screaming.\n\nFinally, glimpses at a source of light. That went on for what felt like a really long time. They\u2019ve really built this thing up. This is going to be insane! Ok, we\u2019ve got a flashlight. It\u2019s not very good, but it\u2019ll do. A surprisingly thin flashlight. Queue the pinhole camera. I actually love when this perspective is utilized well in horror. It really lets you focus on what the director wants you to see, but without exposing too much, leaving room for your imagination to run rampant!\n\nAlright there\u2019s some blood on the ground. Oh shit what\u2019s that! Oh nevermind, just some more blood on the ground. Some weeds with blood on them. Blood, blood, blood. Another strobe light. Blood. A pool of blood. Now we\u2019re in an ocean of blood.\n\nAh, finally \u2013 day light! Wait, what just happened? Did we just spend 20 minutes looking through the perspective of a pinhole? At blood? On the ground? Whatever, no time to reflect I guess, because now we\u2019re puking blood! And snakes. Except they don\u2019t look like snakes. It looks like someone is pulling on a hose with a string. What are those three prongs in the sand? Aaand more blood on rocks. \n\nWait, is it already getting dark again? No, please. They\u2019re not really going to make us go back and\u2014omg it\u2019s the pinhole again. And there\u2019s more blood. On more rocks. And here comes the strobe light again. I\u2019m not even epileptic, but I feel like this is annoying me into epilepsy. Like to the point where I can\u2019t look at the cinema screen anymore. And there\u2019s more blood. Oh shiny flashes of blood on our hands look like stars. Is that a boob? More snakes! And we\u2019re back into the ocean of blood.\n\nWe hear ourselves repeat Hail Mary full of grace for 20 full minutes. More snake things are being pulled by a string around our naked bodies covered in blood. There\u2019s a giant moose creature thing. We can hear it, so we know it\u2019s there. There\u2019s a pinhole view of it, but at this point, I have such a headache from trying to comprehend anything \u2014 let alone everything \u2014 that\u2019s been happening on screen. And the screams. Oh my god, the fucking screams. Over and over. This really does feel like hell, and it\u2019s taking place in a public movie theatre. And I\u2019m being forced to watch it all. Now there\u2019s a pretty light show? We\u2019re moving through the stars.\n\nAaand it\u2019s daylight again. After multiple annoyingly misdirected shots, we finally see what those three prongs in the sand are. It\u2019s our friend\u2019s heads. On spikes. Did we do that? I don\u2019t even care at this point. And we cut off our dick. And now we\u2019re cutting our legs. And now we\u2019re cutting our stomach open. And our intestines are falling out. Finally. We must be close to the end now. The main character reaches for the sky as his guts fall about. Fade to black. \u201cThe Outwaters.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWhat the hell, man. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019ve been spoiled by the likes of Cloverfield and the Blair Witch to the point where I can no longer appreciate the found footage subgenre.\n\nI would absolutely love to hear what ya\u2019ll thought about this one.

He\u2019s not just playing some goofy, comical teenager, he\u2019s high on the fact that he\u2019s actually high. His final minutes in this movie are pure GOLD. Matthew Lillard understood the assignment.\n\nGo back and rewatch it with this in mind, and let me know what you think.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677972835.0},{"title":"Hot Take: The Mist's Ending Was Hilarious","author":"Zauberer-IMDB","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11ka3fc\/hot_take_the_mists_ending_was_hilarious\/","text":"I know a lot of people say it was a depressing gut punch, but there's this sort of adage that comedy = tragedy plus time. Normally that means it can be funny later on, but comedy in general is 90% timing, and here, in this movie, the timing was basically \\*Kill family\\* beat \\*Saved by military\\* NOOOO! Roll credits. It is like a dark Curb Your Enthusiasm episode, just cue the music over the credits. It's a classic set up followed by a punchline situation, and it's of course ironic. I literally laughed the first time I saw it.\n\nI think the issue, for me, is just how quickly it happens. The car stops, there's no immediate danger, they knowingly exchange looks, come to a suicide pact super quickly, he executes everyone, and the military immediately shows up establishing they're going to save the day.\n\nThis could have been rectified by a) more immediate threats, b) more time spent on either aftermath or lead up or really both, c) no military.

I think he says that he is Dracula but I am not certain. Anyways, most of the film is just dialogue between the two of them in this dark and empty building and he mainly talks about how weak and insignificant humanity is.

Thus relinquishing his own immortality so that his spirit could survive on in Corey. This now made Michael vulnerable to being killed.\n\nSo why did Michael eventually turn on Corey later in the movie and kill him anyway? Well, there was a scene where Corey slept with Allyson. I suspect that he impregnated her with what would be born as a new Michael. Therefore, after this, Corey had once again become expendable, as did Michael's own life. He knew he'd live on in Allyson's unborn child, so he gladly entered into one final duel with Laurie, the only victim who got away, knowing that his death would put the people of Haddonfield at ease, not knowing that a new Michael was brewing inside Allyson and would continue his legacy once born.","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1677987413.0},{"title":"What are your favorite Shudder originals?","author":"thunderkhawk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/horror\/comments\/11ica99\/what_are_your_favorite_shudder_originals\/","text":"I'll go first.

I went in with pretty low expectations and did not come out of it disappointed.\n\nTo start out, I feel that the secondary characters were very well introduced. You spend most of your time with the friend who has it all figured out; the very first person you\u2019d presumably grasp onto if something were to go wrong. In contrast, the two other companions get much less intimate screen time and their acting does have you feeling much less connected to them. They did a genuinely good job at making them feel like the \u2018friend of a friend,\u2019 and not necessarily the type you\u2019d go out with alone.\n\nI know this is a fairly commonly used trope in the horror genre, but there was something so desolating about your core friend being taken and consequently being stuck with the other two. I\u2019ve seen this used many a time before, but this movie did such at good job at really striking that feeling of despair. Like no\u2026 don\u2019t leave me\u2026 not with these two. Throughout the rest of this movie, I constantly found myself going between thoughts of leaving them behind and wondering if I\u2019d be worse off alone. First time in a while that I\u2019ve felt this trope was implemented well.\n\nThe creature. I really didn\u2019t know if they were going to continue on with this Blair Witch-styled tease of the unknown for the remainder of the film, or if we were actually going to see something of substance. There\u2019s a certain way that they could\u2019ve gone about the monster that had the potential to really turn me off to this movie, and I was almost expecting as much. Man, was I happy to be wrong about that. The creature design was excellent. Equal parts creepy and disturbing, with still enough hidden from you to keep you guessing. \u201cThis thing is fucked! Why are it\u2019s hands like that? And those eyes\u2026 what\u2019s under that hood? Is that even a hood?\u201d\n\nI think my absolute favourite part of that movie, however, consisted of those series of events that took place at the commune area. When the last companion thinks he sees his wife, but then that turns into the first glimpse you get of that *thing*. Then that one townsfolk drops some subtle lore about living abnormally long, and then you go upstairs to hear this moaning and whaling, only to enter into silence\u2026 to find these people that should be long dead\u2026 but they\u2019re not. And then the scene that follows right after of that *thing* at the door. You only see its beastly legs because it\u2019s so tall. But then it bends down and uses its hands to begin crawling inside. So creepy and disturbing and well done!\n\nI didn\u2019t mind the ending. I think there are some other directions that they could\u2019ve gone with to make it stick with me longer. There\u2019s something about films like this, with a particularly dark ending, that I feel have the potential to add so much to that feeling of hopelessness. I know these movies are completely unrelated, but an ending akin to what they had going in Life (2017); something where you think there might finally be a light at the end of the tunnel, only for it to be infinitely worse than you could\u2019ve ever imagined. It\u2019s that sort of ending that has the movie stuck in my mind for the next month. It\u2019s that sort of ending that has me coming back, year after year, thinking \u201cI need to experience that again.\u201d I really thought this movie was setting itself up for an ending like that, but what we got is still well implemented. It doesn\u2019t detract from the overall experience at all, but more something I\u2019ll just end up forgetting over the next few days.\n\nAnyway, overall excellent movie. I really hope that we see more like this in the future. I had forgotten how much I\u2019ve missed these Blair Witch types.

The setting and the character of Ryder is iconic. But I wonder what others think about it.\n\nA few questions:\n\n1. Could Halsey (protagonist) have saved the girl, Nash, if he shot Ryder while he was sitting with him in the car?\n\n2. Why doesn't Halsey shoot Ryder in that moment - is it because he believes Nash would die, because he thinks he would face legal consequences, or because he can't make himself do it?\n\n3. If Halsey did shoot Ryder, do you think he would be arrested for murder of him and potentially Nash if she died in the process, or do you think at that point the cops were clear that Halsey was innocent and would not see it as a crime in this circumstance. \n\n\n4. Is Ryder's main motivation for Halsey to kill him like he consistently claims? If so, why? Is it because he acted at the very beginning and managed to kick him out, which impressed Ryder in some way? I felt as if Ryder saw a potential in Halsey that could be unleashed if he killed him (and obviously he did also want to get killed), maybe himself in the past. \n\n5. Do you think there is anything surreal or supernatural present in the story? I personally think the story should be taken literally and not seen as if elements of it\/Ryder are in Halsey's head, and I also don't see Ryder as a supernatural being. But I think there is a surreal feel to the story and that there is an obvious connection between Halsey and Ryder that isn't just bad luck on Halsey's part - from the fact Ryder was so fixated on getting killed by him to the fact Halsey was confused for Ryder in several scenes (blamed for his crimes, taking his place in bed with Nash etc) \n\n6. Do you think Halsey could become like Ryder now? I don't really have that impression based on his personality and the fact that I don't see him killing Ryder as some \"loss of humanity\" or whatever. Ryder needed to get killed to stop, and just because he got what he wanted, I don't think that act of killing is immoral in any way. But from narrative pov and with previous points in mind, it almost feels like that's how the story could have gone, I just don't see it. \n\n\nI rated this movie as 8 before but the more I think of it, I think it deserves a 9.

This time, we are doing our second-ever Cross-Genre Challenge!                    \n###**THE \/R\/HORROR CROSS-GENRE CHALLENGE**                    \nWriters that enter the contest will be assigned two separate genres, one horror (ex. body horror, serial killer, alien invasion) and one non-horror (ex. road trip, political thriller, rom-com), and will be given six weeks to write their own feature-length script. \nThe contest begins today, March 3rd, with weekly progress threads every Friday and scripts due by April 14th, 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time. So you have six weeks to write your feature script. Weekly progress threads will be posted on \/r\/screenplaychallenge                                        \n****                                 \n**A FEW RULES:**                   \n- Your screenplay must be a minimum of 70 pages.                \n- Assign genres that make sense and you can see the writer crafting a story out of. For example, Animation would not be an appropriate genre to assign as it's difficult to convey the benefits of an animated film in its screenplay.                    \n- Copyrighted material is not a genre, \"Friday the 13th sequel\" is not allowed. If you want to assign a genre similar to Friday the 13th you would assign \"masked killer.\"                      \n- For your script to compete in the contest, you must give feedback on three other scripts. Feedback threads will be posted on our subreddit and you will have until the ending of the voting period to give you feedback (which does not need to be in-depth)  \n****                                    \n**THE PRIZE**                      \nWinners get to choose their own prize from a selection of options. These range from $100, commissioned concept drawings, blu-ray orders, and printed book copies of their screenplay with original art.                   \n****             \n**TO ENTER THE CONTEST**                                 \n1. In this thread, post something along the lines of \"I am entering the screenplay contest.\"                  \n2. You will be given a \"horror genre\" and a \"non-horror genre\" for your screenplay.                    \n3. Give another writer a \"genre\" and then give a different writer a \"horror genre\" (You can do this multiple times if there are people still missing quotes\/genres, but give time for others to have a chance).                   \nThe point of the contest is to test our creativity and challenge ourselves a bit. However, if you really don't like the genre that you receive, you can request another one. We don't want anyone to get stuck with something they hate or feel they cannot write.                 \n****                      \nAfter you\u2019ve gotten your two genres, join us over at \/r\/screenplaychallenge and feel free to visit our [website](horrorscreenplaychallenge.com) as well.

Martyrs is the first film that made me need 30 minutes of silence after watching. The director has a way of really making you feel for the characters and makes you feel totally shocked by what you are watching. As for the other films listed above they do not really have that. I struggle to take them seriously so they do not scare me the same way. I do think the first Hostel is a great horror film, and i do believe that the story is based on true events but it does not take me on an emotional journey where i feel bad for the characters in the same way. They rely to much on shock factor to really engage me in the story. \n\nMartyrs is not only disturbing and devastating in the worst possible way but it is a great fucking film and i consider it a masterpiece.

Its 2 and a half hours long and like I said I'm not a big military\/war movie person and yet I'm rewatching two days in a row because its that good. The bleakness is stunning.

If you've seen anything recently that you'd like to say a few words about, this is the spot.  All are welcome.\n\n**M3GAN (Unrated) (2022)** I'm usually not sold on surprise box office hits, but this was great fun.  As for the \"unrated\" edition, I hadn't seen the PG13 version so I have nothing to compare it to. There was blood, but nothing really over the top, then a handful of F-bombs.  I though there was a famous dance scene that never happened?  Anybody seen them both for comparison? (Peacock) \n\n**Wild Beasts - Belve Feroci (1984)**  Long before Yogi found a picnic basket fill of blow came this outrageous Italian animals attack flick. PCP finds its way into the City Zoo's water supply and soon the streets are full of bloodthristy lions and tigers, stampeding elephants and even a polar bear! Gore and nudity, this movie delivered the goods. Director Franco Prosperi was one of the three documentarians who made the all-time cult classic Mono Cane.  (DVD)\n\n**Gamera (1965)** Daiei studio's answer to Toho's Godzilla. Gamera has got to be one of the most absurd movie monsters of all time. He's a prehistoric turtle, but he walks on his hind legs. He has hands like a human, which he uses to catch and rescue small children. He eats fire, and when he retracts his appendages, jets shoot from the holes allowing him to spin and fly like a UFO.  And he\u2019s kind to children. In this introduction, he\u2019s awakened by a nuclear blast in the arctic, and the military is stumped when fiery weapon attack just make him stronger. Leave it to a 10 year old to know the turtle just wants to mind his own business. I may have even preferred the Gamera franchise to Godzilla when I was a kid, but not really for this one, but the in color sequels that followed.  (DVD)\n\n**1974: Le Possession de Altair (2016)** Mexican found footage, shot on Super 8. A young married couple\u2019s lives turn upside down when the wife shows signs of possession, and signs point to an incident in her childhood. Basic possession story? Sure, but a full length feature on Super 8 had a great aesthetic, and the ending was really cool. Good movie. (Theater\/Alamo Drafthouse)\n\n**Zombi 4: After Death (1988**) An unofficial Zombi sequel from Claudio Fragasso has the old fashioned Voodoo kind.  A young woman accompanies a group of mercenaries to an island, only to unlock repressed memories that she escaped it as a child, when her parents were killed after their western medicine proved no match for good ol\u2019 fashioned Voodoo.   Outrageous, silly and gory. (TUBI)\n\n**The College Girl Murders (1967)** A red-hooded monk with a bullwhip, a Bond-style villain with an alligator pit, a swimming pool with a peep window, a bible with a poison mist, this movie has a lot going for it, including comedy. This was a late-era \u201cKrimi\u201d the German genre that influenced Italian giallo, and the first one I\u2019ve seen, though I\u2019m guessing earlier ones are less campy. I will definitely be seeking out more.  (TUBI)\n\n**Edge of the Axe (1988) A** not bad little slasher\/whodunnit filmed in Big Bear, California by the same Spanish born director of 1974\u2019s Vampyres.  When this came on the streaming services not too long ago I was confusing it with the video nasty Axe aka Lisa Lisa, otherwise I\u2019d have watched it immediately! (SHUDDER)\n\n**Ebola Syndrome (1996)** A loathsome Chinatown waiter, on the run from murders he committed in Taiwan, contracts Ebola from a tribeswoman he raped on her deathbed in South Africa, and spreads it to the customers when he spits in, and jerks off on menu items, some of which are made from ground humans that he killed. Gross for the sake of gross, from the same director and actor team that brought us The Eight Immortals Restaurant in 1993. (DVD)\n\n**A White Dress for Mariale (1972)** It's the dress her mother was killed in 30 years ago and she wears it to a party, bullet holes intact...and she may not even be the craziest person there! With Ivan Rassimov, Luigi Pistilli, Evelyn Stewart, Pilar Velazquez. Very good giallo. (TUBI)\n\n**Nine Guests for a Crime (1977)** A wonderfully sleazy Ten Little Indians-style late 70s giallo featuring bed-hopping and death threats during a millionaire family island vacation.

It's a cool idea and I was pleasantly surprised that they had him kill that girl. Even though it happened off screen, it was effective and unexpected. It was also a huge failure to act on the side of the main character, which makes things interesting - you'd think it wouldn't be hard to shoot a guy in such situation. This almost gives it an added layer of depth, otherwise it's pretty straight forward but not in a bad way (8\/10)\n\n\n**Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum** - this was such a bad movie, I don't get the reputation it has. The worst of found footage meets the most stereotypical Asian horror - annoying shaky cameras and close-ups of character faces mixed with occasional appearances of some creepy girl with hair over her face standing in the corner as the camera catches her between the shakes. There's absolutely no story there, it's painfully annoying to watch. I have nothing good to say, it's not even a movie, it's not worth a rating.\n\n**Terrified** - I watched this movie before and forgot about it, so when I kept hearing so much praise for it I went to re-watch it to figure out why I don't remember it at all. It's good, I get why people like it, it's not a boring watch but just feels too unresolved for me. Overall ok (7\/10)\n\n**The Divide (2011)** - one comment from this sub got me to put it on my list, aside from that I never heard anyone talk about it and even the rating isn't great. It may have many flaws (e.g. a whole seemingly important storyline disappears after the first part of the movie, why doesn't the main girl release the landlord when he's obviously less of a threat than other guys; how does that brother manage to be conveniently absent for most scenes; the romance plot is completely random and dumb...) but aside from that, it's actually a really good watch. First, the setting is always fun, a group of random people stuck together. Second, the storyline with Rosanna Arquette is brutal. The overall atmosphere and pessimism work well here. Finally, the ending is pretty cool. So, many good ideas, but not really high-level writing, the story could have used some time to get more polished and then some actors are also not great, but if you accept it's a B movie you'll be surprised by how many things about it work. It's not boring and it still sticks with me. (7.5\/10)\n\n\n**Infinity Pool (2023)** - I appreciate the original idea. It's not bad but it lacks something for me, and it's hard to say what. I get that partially the feeling it leaves you with is similar to how the character feels, so there's that. A sense that you just saw all this craziness and still feel uninspired. Maybe that's the point, in that case it achieved what it wanted. What I wanted after that scene with Mia Goth's character on the car was to see the protagonist do to her face what he did to his clone. I don't remember the last time any character annoyed me to such extreme. That is also an accomplishment. Also, although the movie is described as trippy and weird, the story is pretty coherent which is good. So, no big issues with it, intellectually I can appreciate a lot, but it didn't really do much for me and I feel like there should have been more to the story. It's ok, but what's the point? (6.5\/10)\n\n**A Serbian Film** - what shocked me about this movie is that it's not such a bad movie at all. I mostly postponed watching it because I expected total unwatchable trash of a story, but the story is there. It's a relatively believable story, acted well, written ok, with some deliberate comedic elements that mix well with the tone of the movie. I would almost call it a black comedy. What happens to the main character is legit fucked up, and you can wonder if killing his whole family in the end was the best choice. The only comment I have is that his wife is so unrealistic, yeah right she's so loving and understanding all the time it's kind of hilarious. I also like how creative it was with sexual gore, like fucking the eye socket, woman fucking herself to death with a rod, decapitation, teeth removal... and they managed not to involve animal abuse which I appreciate. It's not a dumb movie. It achieves exactly what it wants to achieve (7.5\/10)\n\n\n**Unsane** - I was avoiding this because I heard it was shot on an iPhone so I assumed it was found footage and I wasn't in the mood. It's not found footage, and at least for me, the camera was not an issue. The movie had a perfectly fine feel to it. It's also a surprisingly good movie. I liked how the protagonist was a pretty bad person, and the mix between a stalker and a greedy institution created a realistic threat. I love how the movie shows the exploitative and greedy aspect of mental health\/therapy, it doesn't seem the least bit far-fetched. The stalker is a pretty pathetic figure and at one point teleports ahead of the protagonist, but it doesn't really take from the movie. It just seems like the movie wanted to say something more about her character and like there was some backstory with her dad but then it didn't really matter. Overall, very strong (7.5\/10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also tried skinamarink again but still couldn't go beyond 15 min that felt like 3h, I guess I have to wait for the right moment.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677862457.0}]
