        "text": "For some context, I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/99yskp/advice_nmom_her_great_favors_upon_us_baby_coming/) about NMom's behavior about a month ago. TLDR on that post; NMom threw 'favors' in my face in order to paint herself as a self sacrificing victim - these favors were really regarding my sister and not me. After this happened I decided to confront her about the ridiculousness of her claims because I'm not going to let her cause rifts in my relationship with my sister and let her get away with baseless claims. This entire experience has been really eye opening for my sister who didn't realize the extent of how crazy NMom is and she is now actively keeping a distance from NMom since her claims and behavior have been so outrageous that they went far enough to have caused a temporary rift in my sister's marriage. There is too much information to share here and it gets so petty it's embarrassing so I'm not getting into those details.\n\nMy relationship with NMom has obviously gone downhill since this confrontation after almost an entire year of distance and calm - calm because I've kept a very, very distant and cautious relationship with her until I let my guard down this summer believing my mother was changing since becoming a grandmother. Obviously, I was wrong. Anyway, I'm now 38 weeks pregnant and due any day. My mother hasn't communicated with me in over a month and I doubt she's even going to come down to visit my first child. Husband and I have also made the decision to stay at his parents house when we visit the city our parents live in during the month of December. So again, back to keeping a very, very distant relationship with mother. The only reason I haven't cut her out completely is really cultural reasons that keep us part of a very large extended family dynamic plus the fact that my husband won't do that - which is really what this post is about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband values family beyond anything else. We currently live really far away from any family and have a very small number of friends who we only see occasionally due to the nature of the city we live in (everyone is always traveling). It's really just us and it affects him a lot. He's always down about the fact that we don't have family close by especially when it comes to big occasions - religious holidays or even big things to celebrate in our lives. I've felt it too but I believe I stopped having family when I was back in high school because of how damaged our relationships were so I don't feel as strongly as him about it. These days we've been talking about how crazy it is that baby is going to be here any day now and he's just so down. It's yet another big moment in our lives that we're going through without anyone here to enjoy or share in it with us. Every weekend he asks me if I'm ready to call my mother and my answer is 'no' but he keeps asking and hoping things will change anyway even if it is a damaged relationship. When I talk to him about my mother's behavior he's understanding but believes that for the sake of family things should be ignored or resolved on our end even if the parent is hugely at fault/ selfish/ aggressive - whatever the case. He gives examples of his own mother who is far from perfect and has some similar tendencies but it's certainly a very different dynamic and just isn't comparable. He tells me how he wishes things would be okay with my mother and that NMom and I having issues affects him too because he wants to keep these relationships in our life. (This statement actually really pisses me off because I just want to say, 'don't you think I want a mother that cares about me too?!') I guess this is a rant and I don't really know what I'm asking but I just wish I could somehow make this better for him, and us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\\* Of course Redditers just need an excuse to rip apart my spouse, my best friend, and my greatest support. I am honestly blown away by some comments so maybe I'll take a step back and clear up a few things: My husband puts me and our child before ANY family. My husband simply asks me once a week if I'm ready to call my mom followed by 'it's okay if you say no'. My answer every week is 'no' and he won't ask again. The reason why he asks to begin with is because culturally we've been raised to have a very, very strong level of respect and care towards our parents and although he understands my 'unique' situation he always wants us to make sure we're doing our part. For example, I've seen him deal with his verbally abusive father time and time again. I strongly believe he should go NC because I see it's straight up abuse but instead he deals with his father in a calm and collected manner and is always forgiving despite how hard it is because at the end of it all he wants to say he cared and he tried even if his own father didn't. He isn't pushing that mindset on me, it's just his way of dealing with things.\n\nMy husband isn't being a whiny bitch about being NC with NMom or being far away from family - that is due to circumstances that I don't need to explain but suffice to say, we travel at least every three months to visit different members of our family because both of us want to be there for them and be a part of the lives of our nieces and nephews. He also isn't complaining to me about being NC - I can just tell when he has days where he's really saddened by certain situations in our lives and this isn't something that can just be brushed under a rug and forgotten. And yes, he did have a time in his life when his family was very very connected and he's able to look upon that time with so much fondness that he hopes to be able to give a similar experience to our child. There are no doubt lots of benefits to young children being raised in an environment filled with lots of friends or family as long as those relationships aren't toxic.\n\nSo, lovely redditors, please stop jumping on everyones spouses in such a harsh manner. \n\nI hear the advice of marriage counseling to give him greater understanding and will look into it, so thanks for that as it wasn't something that really crossed my mind.",

The last time we spoke was when her husband was screaming at me, I never really got the chance to let her know why I really went NC, not because of him, because of her.\nSo I decided that seeing her in person would be too much for me, I wrote an email yesterday.\nA long email saying that I wish I could have been more clear with her, I don’t want contact at all anymore and this is why. I laid it all out as objectively as I could, the mental abuse and manipulation. I didn’t leave any examples, just the facts. This is what you did and the consequence is NC until you get some real mental help. \nI ended it saying I don’t hate you, I love you and I hope you get the help you need.\nIt was a real relief writing and sending that to her, at least it’s off my chest and in front of her face. I said what I needed to say.\nShe responded by making herself the victim *shocking!* she won’t acknowledge the abuse, and actually won’t stand for my abuse on her in the email(?)\nIf anything, I’m content with saying my peace and letting her go. I obviously have a lot of mixed emotions, and I’m trying my hardest to not let myself feel guilty. Be happy with my life and hope the best for her.\nThere may be some blow back from extended family in the future, but I’ll cross that bridge when I get there.",

        "text": "**tl;dr at the bottom**\n\nI never liked the narcissist terminology because if some human behavior is so alien to me that I have to learn a new vocabulary to understand it, then it's probably not the obvious and natural explanation. \n\nThen recently it all clicked for me. It's about parenthood. \n\nEvery child needs a role model to look up to, who can protect them in the world and teach them how to live.\n\nThe problem is that being a parent is extremely difficult, maybe the most difficult human task to learn.\n\nTo be a parent you must conquer yourself. You must face fear and fight a stronger person whenever someone threatens your child. You must make decisions by yourself for the good of the child. You must let go of your addictions and pay attention to your child when they need you.\n\nChildren are hard wired to expect all this but they don't have the strength to demand it, and narcissists are just people who take advantage of this need, without actually making the effort to become virtuous.\n\nThis applies both to narcissistic parents and narcissistic friends, spouses etc.\n\nIf a child's respect or safety is threatened in a social situation, it's much easier for a weak parent to join the \"stronger\" person in attacking the weak child, than to face a stronger threat and protect the weak child. It goes against the natural instinct of self preservation.\n\nIt's much easier for a parent to hit a weak child in private than to face intimidation in public.\n\nIt's much easier to blame a child for their needs, than to put your lazyness aside and make a consistent effort for them. \n\nInstead of being someone who is worthy of being looked up upon by being courageous, hardworking, virtuous etc, it's much easier to put down someone who needs you and depends on you so that you appear to be better. \n\nIn The Pimp Game he says, \"how will the ho look up to you if you don't look down on her\", well by being virtuous people look up to you. By exploiting their need to look up to someone by putting them down, you may be looked up to for a while but you're kind of missing the point. \n\nInstead of becoming strong, it's much easier to find someone weaker who can't fight back and win every fight against them. \n\nInstead of actually having to make an effort for your partner, be honest and change when it is needed, it's much easier to feed their vulnerabilities so that they can't leave you. \n\n**tl;dr: It's not \"narcissism\", it's just the animalistic strong/weak dynamic of nature. They just go for the easy way and take advantage of the weak and dependent, instead of having to grow.**",

        "text": "TL/DR: I got bored of the healthy girlfriend, I enjoy the abusive Ngirlfriend. What is wrong with me?\n\n\n\nI married a Narc woman. When we met she was a golden child perhaps recovering from the abuse of her mother and grandmother. Later she went into postnatal depression that lasted about four years. Oh God how she hated the baby. She violently refused treatment. She came out of her depression with a fully fledged NPD. After a few years I couldn't take it any longer and left. Took 3 and a half years of intense, unrelenting legal battle but now is done. False allegations, kidnapping the kid, perjury, hiding assets, physical violence... Anything and everything you can imagine in a divorce from hell, she did.\n\n\n\nBut now it's done. It's finished, there is nothing else to do or to fight about. In the meantime I have dated a very large number of women. For a while I was caught in a loop where I was very sad to see that random stranger women I didn't care about desired and enjoyed me while the woman I had dedicated my life to had despised me for so long. I kept having anonymous sex, and it kept making me sad but I kept having more that made me sadder because the more desirable I found myself to be the more obvious my marriage had always been awful.\n\n\n\nFrom all these women eventually emerged a girlfriend and in time I stopped seeking new women and after a while I wasn't having sex with anyone else. She is a good person. She was my friend, my confident, my partner. But I did not love her. I never felt passion. Intellectually I knew her to be perfect for me but there were no fireworks. I let the relationship go cold and we broke up.\n\n\n\nNow I am dating a Narc. She is a textbook narc and so is her mother. There are so many red flags I don't know where to start. She has no female friends, she is a golden child, she makes up stories about herself, she thinks she is special and above most everyone else, she continuously insults her dog... The full Npackage. \n\n\n\nI am thoroughly enjoying the relationship. When it goes up it's exhilarating. I absolutely enjoy the love bombing phases. When it goes down I distance myself, it's like watching a football game on TV. I find myself commentating in my head: \"now she is trying to make me jealous\", \"oh look at the gaslighting\" and so on. I really, *REALLY* like her physically. The softness of her skin and the smell of her sweat go straight into the most primitive part of my brain. It's like being at the top of a bell tower when all the bells are ringing. There is no space to feel or to think anything else. Her skin on my fingertips it's the whole universe. \n\n\n\nSo, what is wrong with me? Why do I let Ms Perfect go and why do I enjoy the crazy one so much? How do I get better? I want to love healthy women, I don't want to be stuck with the crazies for the rest of my life ",

I been living with them ever since.\n\n\nBut in these 4 years, they systematically destroyed my career, my self-esteem and my real estate business which I set up because the destroyed my engineering career .

I see that it’s extremely embarrassing for a 36 year old to still live with his family and I want to make more money so I can move out once and for all. I rarely talk to my mother or my brother because all they want to do is accuse me of something or manipulate or humiliate me one way or other.\n\n\nI am setting up a Web Design business right now, but I am stuck for some reason and I don’t know why.

Can you please help me figure out what this could be?\n\n\nI have read about learned helplessness and I am not sure if that is it because I don’t know if I am thinking whether or not I will be a failure even if I move out so my brain is holding me back from even attempting to try. \n\n\nI don’t know what it is, but I am sick of this life living with them and I want to move ahead in life.

I was lucky enough to find a job the same week I moved, which was great, but I started realizing right away that the social environment was not for me. I’ve been treated quite rudely, ignored, and trained in a very unorganized way. I was trying to stick it out and see if friendships begin to form, but right now my confidence has gone to zero. Two women I work with directly have begun to “undo” my training. I am chastised for doing my work by the book, and I am encouraged to do things the wrong way. Comments have been made that I’ve been shown favoritism by our male superiors due to my appearance, and these women need walk only a few feet away before they begin talking about me (I clearly hear my name and catch them staring). If I’m cheerful with a customer, they reenact it. If I am normal, I am approached about the “nervous” look on my face. My other coworkers have begun to warm up to me, but are also friends with these women and seem unconcerned with their antics. I had previously considered one of these women a friend and was shocked by her behavior today. My confidence level is zero and I am so, so uncomfortable every minute I am there. \n\nMy coworkers call, text, and email outside of work every day. I was told it “looks bad” that I am not attending weekend bar outings with the company. This is a minimum wage job, not a career position. All I want is a simple job, a relationship, and good grades. I spent the last year living under constant, rage fueled abuse with my mother just to afford school and a move to this city. I want a fucking break. I have worked a lot of iffy jobs, but I have never felt this kind of dread going to work. When I was being abused, there were times I felt like I had nothing to lose and was so motivated to change my circumstances. There were also times when the stakes were so high I was afraid to move and lost my entire inner spark. I’m currently feeling the latter— like I have been sucked dry emotionally and just want to curl in a ball. I need my confidence and my drive back if I want to find another job. I cannot be bothered with this bullshit right now and I have been in a very negative tailspin.\n\nI am hoping someone here will understand why this is creating such a dark, urgent fear in me. All I want is simplicity. I do not want my personal shell to come under fire at work. I do not want to be *known* and examined at work. My damn soul feels tired.",

        "text": "I finally distanced myself from a close friend who I have come to believe is a covert passive aggressive N. We used to have daily phone conversations that were more like therapy sessions, with her in the therapist role. She would call me on her way to work every morning, like clockwork, and I would be expected to open up and generate heavy personal talk about whatever was bothering me.\n\nOver time, I became dependent on her validation and approval, and would run to her with any problem I was having, which is what I think she wanted, as this gave her a lot of power and control in the relationship. All she had to do is periodically withhold the validation and the supportive attitude, and instead become aloof, dismissive and critical and begin subtly ignoring me, and I would feel confused and upset and eager to make things right again, even though I had no idea what was wrong. Her rejecting behaviors were so covert that if I confronted her I would no doubt sound petty and overly sensitive. But over time I learned to trust my gut and to trust that the way this hot &amp; cold behavior made me feel, was a reliable indicator that I was dealing with a toxic person, and a false friend.\n\nSo I finally worked up the nerve to tell her that I didn't want to have the daily morning therapy sessions anymore. I had begun to realize that they were draining me, and that I would hang up feeling negative and icky. I found that, if you're going thru a traumatic time, having a supportive listener to talk to is very helpful, but if you're not in a crisis, then having to open up and put on display whatever is going wrong in your life, so that it can be discussed and analyzed, is not helpful. My friend wasn't *actually* a therapist, so talking about negative heavy subjects, first thing in the morning, without any purpose in mind than just to vent, was putting me in a depressing, angry mindset by the time we hung up.\n\nThe most amazing thing about being done with this \"friendship\" is the amount of peace and calm I feel. I hadn't expected that not doing the morning therapy sessions would have this much of an effect. It's really amazing. I've realized I was continually attracting new drama and things to complain about, into my life, simply by having her there, the eager audience who was feeding on all of it. By continually complaining and venting and doing my victim dance with this friend, I was thereby attracting more of this kind of energy, so that eventually, my days were full of drama and conflict, which I would bring to her for our morning therapy routine.\n\nSince I stopped talking to her, I've come to realize what a toxic person she really was, bc her absence has brought so much calm and peace. I actually had something happen this week that was a big deal, something negative, and I would normally have gone running to her to vent and complain and get her validation. Instead, I have handled it totally differently - like a grownup. The peace that is now running through my days is stunning to me. I think that that particular friendship survived and thrived on drama, so drama kept manifesting in my life, and once the friendship was gone, so was a lot of the drama. That particular person wasn't a direct source of drama and conflict, but I think that is what she feeds on through her targets, so you need to keep generating that negativity if she's going to stick around.\n\nI think this particular kind of N experiences their grandiosity/superiority by being above you - poor little you with all your problems! They can take pity on you and befriend you through your crisis. I've had to realize that normal people don't want to put themselves in the middle of someone's problems they met on the internet and set themselves up as the person's #1 adviser and cheeerleader. I've learned that someone you just met who wants to be your mentor, and give hours every day to listen to your problems, is a red flag.\n\nMy friend apparently has had a string of people like me, that she's found on forums, people going through hell because of a N, who are traumatized, and she swoops in and quickly establishes herself as their biggest supporter, and spends hours on the phone counseling them through their situation. I have no doubt I will soon be replaced with a new person just like this. She doesn't seem interested in a friendship between equals, where you're just regular normal friends. This is how I knew that by ending the morning therapy sessions, I would be effectively ending her interest in me. If she can't be \"above\" me (poor little me), then I have no use for her. Her work is done.",

        "text": "So at the beginning of the month I moved in to a new flat as a lodger; it’s just me and the landlord, a guy a couple of years older than me, in the flat. I have an inner ear issue that causes frequent dizziness, with flare-ups varying from slight nausea and falls to not being able to turn my head on the pillow, lasting from an hour or so to a couple of months. It just so happens that a week after moving in I’ve had a slight flare-up of my dizziness, so I’ve had a couple of falls here. Last night I had a really bad 3 or 4 hours and my landlord and his girlfriend (who was spending the night) found me on the kitchen floor holding a bag and my head. \n\nI told them both I would be fine, since the flat is all on one floor I’d be fine to crawl to my bed once my stomach settled a bit, but my landlord handed me a glass of water and said he’d give me a few minutes then come back for me. He did just that, and helped me walk to my room and made sure I was safely on my bed with my phone, a full bottle of water, and a bag right next to me. Since then I’ve really been struggling not to cry at how nice he’s being.\n\nWhen I was 14/15 I spent too long talking to my grandmother as she was giving me advice on an extra-curricular award I was working on. Unbeknownst to me my father had plans to drop me and my sister home before heading to the flavour of the month for sex. As punishment for delaying his dick-wetting he ran over my foot. Over a decade later I still have massive problems with my foot and this week have had to spend half a month’s rent replacing all of my winter shoes because my toes have been numb/had pins and needles after moving and since last winter yet more requirements have been added to what my doctor/the nurse say I should be looking for in shoes to avoid flaring up my old injury. But with his girlfriend waiting for him in his room, while I was perfectly capable of crawling, my landlord went out of his way to help the *day after* I’ve had a reminder that my father’s reaction to a slight delay in being alone with his not actual girlfriend is to cause me permanent damage, slap me for crying from the pain, refuse to allow me to seek medical attention, then go absolutely apeshit when I didn’t immediately help him hide the cause of my injury from my teachers the next day. \n\nThe first year after my inner ear damage became permanent I was living in a house with 3 other students. Two of the girls I’d already lived with the year before. During a particularly bad flare-up where I hadn’t been able to walk or keep food down for a couple of days I asked one of the girls if she would get and make-up a cuppa soup from my cupboard. I heard them laughing downstairs and shouting things like “man up!” When the dizziness started easing up I was advised to use walking sticks so I could get to lectures. A normally 15 minute walk took around an hour, but with the sticks I could attend my classes. The girls told me I shouldn’t go out in public if I had to use sticks, and when they failed to convince me they warned me not to acknowledge them in public because they would be too embarrassed to be seen with someone with walking sticks. \n\nMy landlord has been telling me since the day I moved in not to apologise for things; I just laughed and told him people have been trying to stop me for years so that was a lost cause. Interestingly he’s mostly moved from saying “don’t apologise” to “why?” Hearing myself saying things like “for removing my make-up?” has sort of made me realise how fucking ridiculous I am being sometimes, which is something no one who’s tried to break me of the habit has done before. He text me today asking how I was and in my response I apologised for disturbing his and his girlfriend’s evening. He basically text me “don’t talk bollocks, you didn’t disturb us”. When he got back to the flat he was going to catch a bus somewhere, but wasn’t sure if he’d get there in time, so I offered him a lift (I am safe to drive, I’ve checked with my doctor). I’ve been warned by my doctor to go slowly when walking down stairs, so I apologised as I was walking in front of him. He told me that when I apologise I make him feel guilty. He also told me not to apologise for apologising, which I don’t think I’ve actually done with him as I normally start laughing when I catch myself doing that. He’s stopped me a couple of times when I’ve over-explained things, sort of a “all you need to say is x, I don’t need to know everything”. So I get the impression he’s dealt with people with FLEAs in the past.\n\nSo I don’t know. My main reason for posting is that I’m struggling to handle him being so nice, and I really want to cry today because of it. But I’ve been curious about the ‘why’s and his apparent knowledge of FLEAs. This evening though I can’t stop wondering about his comment about feeling guilty when I apologise. I really want to ask him about that, and about his experience with FLEAs, but I’m not sure if or how to do this for many reasons, one of which being the likelihood I’ll cry.\n\nShark week has chosen to make its presence known today, and I’ve been a bit emotional about the fact that this coming Saturday is when I’ll have lived the same number of days as my mother did, plus the aforementioned reminder of my father’s behaviour that led to my foot being weird this month, and for some reason I had my first nightmare about my father in months the other night. Essentially to be honest it’s impressive I’m not crying over something like my avocado being cut slightly wonky today, but I’m hoping that next week I’ll be more emotionally stable and might be able to ask him without making an arse of myself. Should I/how should I ask him about these things?\n\nAnd possibly more importantly, how do I stop finding it so hard to be helped?",

        "text": "Obligatory throwaway, and I'm not sure this is the best sub for this, but...\n\nMy (23M) former (online only) best friend of the last 9 years is allegedly starving himself to death. I say allegedly, because he has faked suicide attempts before, all I have is his word and that doesn't mean much right now. \n\nSince about 2013 I have assisted him with his many issues, OCD, depression, ... I am not a trained mental health professional, but I helped him cope or at least exist to the best of my abilities. Quite often sacrificing my own well-being for his sake. My personal value was defined by him and his need of me. It wasn't healthy.\n\nI am struggling with aspergers, physical issues and chronic depression, though on a path to recovery. Having found a temporary job, restarting higher education, started therapy, and met an amazing guy who let me believe in myself. All in the few months since I broke off contact with that friend.\n\nThis went on until about April this year...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave to disclose, I am gay, he was bi, and there was an unspoken desire for something more in both of us. But by then he had got a girlfriend he obsessed over for about the same length of time as I've tried to help him. \n\nIn 2013, he pulled this manipulative move where he would fake his suicide to get back at her, emotionally. I went along with it, even though I was 18 years old by then, they were 16-17. I should've known better, but I didn't. I never even stopped to think if she was deserving of such a move (as if anyone could be deserving of that). She hurt my friend and that was good enough. I definitely see how fucked up it was now. I don't think I am that person anymore, I try not to be.\n\nWhatever happened in the last few months doesn't justify it back then. But, she was visibly undoing his progress, he sank deeper into drug abuse, was more drunk than sober, would talk shit on her and flirt with me (I was trying to get over him) then get mad about it the next day. I found out they were dating because he (said he) was hospitalised after a suicide attempt, and he told me everything about it.\n\nWe broke off contact after a fight. I always helped him, but I was struggling with college and a lot of other parts of my life were falling apart. When I needed help, he always turned it back around, so it was about him again, and I needed to comfort him. \n\nI couldn't do that anymore...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last message he sent me that day, was basically 40 lines of hate. Attacking every fibre of my character, the things I'm passionate about, saying I'd use my autism as an excuse to be a horrible person, when I've always told him mental illnesses don't have to define who he is.\n\nI should've let that message be a bridge burner, but after weeks of contemplation, I responded to a message he left me. \n\nWe talked, he didn't believe he did anything wrong, it was my fault for taking it that way, overthinking it. Whatever was said was his 'anger' and 'shock' speaking out, he didn't mean it. Besides, I was just as bad as he is.\n\nI cut off contact again, this time not granting him a last message...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, I received an e-mail, I panicked, I tried to contact him, I called in to work that I wouldn't be going today, to deal with this situation.\n\nHe responded, claims he hasn't eaten in 4 days and that he'll die in 2 more. He's hallucinating and his body is in emergency mode. I don't know what any of that means but he still strikes the same tone and still feels 'all there'.\n\nThe fact I even can doubt my closest friend if he needs help is fucked up to me. That it got this far, when did it start? 2013 makes me think he always was capable, I was capable. \n\nHe withdrew my responsibility for him. I tried my best to help him, but I gave him an ultimatum. 'Go to a hospital because I can't be here with you if you don't.'\n\nHis reply? 'ok, see you again, I guess...' A few hours later...\n\nHim: sorry, goodbye \n\nMe: get checked in\n\nHim: fucking hell why\n\nMe: I won't enable your 'self destruction'\n\nMe: get professional help\n\nMe: I have nothing else to say\n\nIs this what a genuine cry for help would be like? Am I a horrible person for keeping my distance, to protect myself? I don't know what to do. Noone healthy does things like this, but he'd take me down with him if I got involved again. I couldn't save him after 7 years, I can't just talk to him when he's 'starving' and pretend it's all alright. I don't want to see him as hopeless, but I can't be the one hoping for him.",

        "text": " I've posted a few times on reddit about a friend I knew for about 8-10 years. She has abused me and gaslighted me into thinking we were close and that I was crazy for most of the time that I've known her, and I finally *finally* got my head on straight and realized it. I cut contact with her completely. I realized that she's a narcissist.\n\nIt took her two months to notice that I'd stopped contacting her. Two full months, if that is any indication of how little she really cared for me. I literally dropped off the face of the planet for two months and she did not notice.\n\nShe texted me on Sunday saying that she would be in my state (IL) and would like to hang out. I politely said \"No, I'm sorry I can't. My husband and I are very busy during the month of October, and we have plans the weekend that you will be in town.\"\n\nShe told me that it was good to see that I am finally doing something with my life, because I never had anything going on before. I am an introvert, I ENJOY having a quiet, unbusy life. She knows this, I've told her many times that just because I'm not frantically running from one activity to another does not mean I'm not busy, but she acted like it was stupid that my life is not full of the meaningless endeavors that hers is.\n\nShe then called me a liar, saying if I didn't want to see her then I should just say so. I was not, am not, and never will be a liar. I. Tell. The. Truth. And there are very few things in this life that make me angrier than when someone calls me a *liar*.\n\nI did not respond. As I said, I had cut ties with her. I was finally brave enough, smart enough whatever you want to call it, and had succinctly told her we would not be spending time together while she was in town.\n\nShe then messaged me this: \n\n\"Alright, I get the message lol, but after 8 years of knowing each other, do you at least have the kindness and maturity to have one last phone call or facetime? \n\nI really thought there was more to you than how you're handling this, and I'll be honest, I'm incredibly confused by what's happening.   \nI would love to know why you'\n\nyou're treating me like this, and hear your side of the story. I don't want to view you as a bad guy for the rest of my life. You're not, you're clearly hurting.   \nObviously I can't force you, I just though you of all people wouldn't just ghost someone.   \nregardless of what path you choose, I will be praying for you and I hope you have an incredible future ❤\"\n\nAgain, I didn't respond. It was becoming clear that she was baiting me. \n\nShe texted me one last time, basically saying goodbye, and then sent me a two page email this morning, right before I went to work, saying she is disappointed in me, but not surprised because I was always a shitty friend to her and never valued her and that I need to grow up, that I'm handling this wrong and she understands why I can't face that fact because I'm so immature and evil, and a TON of other hurtful, mean things that just are NOT TRUE.\n\nEven though I know it isn't true, I am still so hurt by her words. I have never been anything but a good friend to her, I did not deserve to be treated the way she treated me, but she is making me the villain here.  \nI am not saying I'm a saint, by any means, but this is uncalled for and just plain mean.\n\nI'm just so hurt and sad and angry and relieved and I don't know what to think.\n\nLink to the letter: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tnp1ODXmtccRs8BIURGm0de0DR0zYu7CYjv-N1vbGjs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tnp1ODXmtccRs8BIURGm0de0DR0zYu7CYjv-N1vbGjs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nShe does a good job of making me look like the bad guy here. IDK what I'm looking for on this post, just maybe some reassurance that I'm not the piece of shit that she says I am.\n\nIt's really hard for me to come to terms with the fact that I was abused in this way. My heart is breaking, but I'm also *furious*. This is all so fresh. Please help. ",

Naunt and her are fighting, n aunt has looked like she's gearing up to sue for like 2 years. Husband jokingly wants me to go just to report the drama. E grandma and I never had an especially great relationship.. Not bad but she's just not a warm person. Never called on birthdays or holidays, when I call she's polite but keeps all calls under 3 minutes because of long distance $.. She has a lot of poverty traits from the great depression. She didn't travel out to my wedding, or my brother's, and neither did any of my Aunts /uncles or cousins although all were invited. No excuses, no bad blood, just not a close family and I guess they didn't feel like it. For the record, historically I travel to their state for major life events (all cousins weddings), and major some major holidays. \n\nEgran has 4 daughters, and navigates all of her relationships to her grandchildren and great grandchildren through her daughters. She is 88, but she's never reached out to my kids. I've sent birthday invitations, I call maybe twice a year. Nmom talks to Egran for an hour every Sunday, so there's not much I can say that Egran doesn't know. I've been NC with nmom for 8 months, I don't have any idea what nmom has said. She has a tendency not to tell Egran anything that would reflect poorly on her though.. \n\nNot sure if it's relevant but Egran has ~500k cash in her will that she's dividing evenly amongst her daughters with instructions to then divide amongst the grandchildren and great grandchildren as the daughters see fit. Nmom has already told us years ago not to expect anything, because she needs it.\n\nSo I'm not going to the funeral, certainly not bringing my two very young children. I'm lightly entertaining the idea of a solo trip to see the grave. I don't even know how to feel though. Right now I don't feel anything. \n\nI'm just curious for those who have been through this, how did you navigate? Do you have any regrets, anything that you'd do differently?",

It just occurred to me that I'm not in touch with any of the people I had relationships with (friends, gfs), and I've known these people for many years.\n\nIt's just that I never really bonded with anybody because I was never really myself. Whenever I get closer to someone, my betrayed childhood trained fight or flight kicks in and I blow the whole thing up over some nonsense. I don't see myself ever really being vulnerable or honest with anyone.\n\nI've met some new friends in the last couple of years who are decent people, but they're all in their twenties and themselves are estranged from society, which is the only type of person I can relate to.\n\nI can't even imagine having someone I trust and actually love and respect walking the journey of life with me. I never stayed in touch with anyone for more than 2-3 years, except of course my narc \"friend\". Who am I going to hook up with? A female narc survivor who never learned how to function in society either? Or a 25yo with daddy issues?\n\nIt's one thing to spontaneously fall in love with someone in your twenties or early thirties and start a family. It happens as a surprise and it's the natural course of life. It's a totally different matter to have to find a mate among all the other failures because you don't want to die alone. One is a flower, the other is shit. \n\nIt feels like these developmental stages are built upon one another, and because my fundamental human connection of trust was damaged, as in I bonded over betrayal rather than over trust, everything that was built on it always collapsed.\n\nI'm not at the stage when I'm young and energetic and want to socialize anymore, but that is the developmental task I failed at so I can't build a meaningful romantic relationship on top of it. My needs are different now, I just want to stay at home in a quiet environment.\n\nI just feel like everyone got on the school bus and I missed it and was left behind.\n\nEdit: typo",

It was a tough but cathartic write, and I sent it to my nmom by registered mail; I wanted a signed confirmation she got it.  Maybe it wasn't the best choice to send it to her, but it was my choice and I stand by it. \n\nNow however, I received an email from the aforementioned Nmom.  My wife read it by herself to let me know if there was anything important in it, and then I asked her to delete it; I want nothing more to do with my Nmom.  My wife did delete but didn't clear the deleted items folder, and so like a curious and soon-to-be dead cat, I found the email and read it.  It's pasted at the bottom of this post, so I'm open to interpretations if people are so inclined.  But it opened a bag of emotions for me.\n\nShe tells me she's proud of me.  Multiple times.  And I can't help but scream in my head, \"then why did you wait until NOW to tell me that?  I never internalized that from you when you said it, because you were yelling at me so often!  Would you storm to your student's desk and tip their desk over, or tear up all their favorite items when they misbehaved?  No?  THEN HOW WAS DOING THAT TO YOUR OWN SON ANY DIFFERENT?!  If you treated your students like you treated me, you would be fired and brought up on charges of assault so fast your head would spin.  SO WHAT MAKES IT OKAY TO DO IT TO ME?!  Would you scream and yell at your gifted student because he got a B, or turned in an assignment late?  So what gives you the right to do it to me?  \n\nAnd don't you DARE tell me it's because you are my mother; you've studied literature, you of all people have read and agreed with [Kahlil Gibran.](http://www.katsandogz.com/onchildren.html)  If it's not okay to do to your students, and it wasn't okay when your own mother did it to you, WHY IS IT OKAY TO DO IT TO ME?!  Is that what makes me gifted and special?  Did I have special thick skin to endure that abuse?  \n\nIf you are so proud, why did I never feel that?  I wanted so badly for my efforts and accomplishments to be enough for you, but they never were.  High school ended fifteen years ago; middle school almost twenty.  THE PRAISE IS A LITTLE TOO LATE, DON'T YOU THINK? \n\nObviously I'm not going to respond, and she will never hear this rant.  She's out of my life, and she's not allowed back in; she had three decades of chances with me.  But I think I should have just listened to my first reaction and deleted her message before reading it.  Thank you guys for giving me a place to scream at the sky in frustration.  \n\nAnd now, her email, with identifiers removed;\n\n&gt; /u/talented_fool,\n\n&gt; I have read and reread your certified letter of goodbye many times. I have so many things to say in reply (not that you want, or are expecting one) that it would be book length. What I am most profoundly sorry for is that I did not communicate enough how much I loved you, valued you, and was proud of you.\n\n&gt; So, for your wedding anniversary, here is a short list of moments that I was-and still am-incredibly proud of you:\n\n&gt; I think your finding, courting, and marrying [wife] was fabulous. She seems to be your true sole mate-you complement each other in so many ways, and you make each other laugh all the time. She is a smart, resilient, resourceful, compassionate, and beautiful woman. It is no mean feat to find and click with someone like that. I am so proud of you for accomplishing this successful marriage. This is something that I did not do so well in my own life, so I am proud of you for seeing beyond my examples.\n\nThat's one thing you taught me well; how NOT to marriage.\n\n&gt; I know [wife] has big struggles with the pain and mobility issues of her condition. I am so proud of you for being there for her and doing all in your power to make things easier/smoother. It is not an easy road for the two of you, I am sure you both had to make many adaptations and changes as a result. I am proud of both of you for coping and handling this so well, where others would have caved.\n\n&gt; I am proud of you for making and maintaining a great network of friends in your area (and beyond). I well remember how you struggled in both [hometown] and [hometown2] with kids your age bullying or marginalizing you. You had a tight group of friends in [hometown2] but it was small, and you have come into your own and have a big group in [current state].  I tried my hardest to make that easier for you as a kid; I really believed that moving from [ht#1] to [ht#2] would be the fresh start with a different caliber of kids so it would not happen again. I am so sorry that it happened here too, but I am so proud of you for having the resiliency to get beyond it.\n\nI didn't have that resiliency; you and society beat it into me.  The first fifteen years of my life was a never-ending lesson in how to not cry, mostly from you\n\n&gt; I am proud of you for making friends everywhere you have worked, and for making such a success of your job at [employer]. That is not an easy thing to do in this age where employees are often treated as completely replaceable. It is a testimony to both your people skills and hard work that you’ve thrived in your career. We both know that I firmly believed that a college degree was necessary for success, but you have proved me wrong in a big way, and I am so proud of you for that.\n\nYeah well, it never was a necessity; it's not what you know but who you know.  Oh and thanks for reminding me how I got laid off earlier this year.\n\n&gt; I am proud of how you have kept a good relationship with your brother. You were so good as his best man. Even though I knew you were incredibly unhappy/mad/upset (I don’t know what word to use) with me, and I was worried that it might be awkward as a result. You were unfailingly polite to make no waves on his special day.\n\nWe bonded over the trauma you collectively inflicted on us both.  [Brother] had the right idea all along, there is nothing of emotionally redeeming value you had to offer.  [nd [SIL] asked and I said yes.  It was their special day, not a time to air our grievances.  I tolerated you for the first two decades of my life, I can make nice for one day so I never have a reason to see you again.\n\n&gt; I am proud of you for seeking out and going to therapy as an adult, whether it is just for you or couple’s therapy. I cannot begin to tell you how sad I am that one of the results is that you want to completely cut me off. However, I knew you struggled with depression and other issues for many years. I tried helping you by taking you to different therapists several times. None of them meshed with you, and you were not willing or ready to trust and work with any of them. I tried to find good people for you; I am sorry none of it was helpful. I don’t know if you are aware, but I have gone to therapy with different people on and off my whole adult life. Some of them were jerks; some gave horrible advice that I wish I never followed, some were okay; the one I see now is helpful. I am truly sorry for things I did when you were growing up that gave you pain and made you feel unloved. I hope that someday you can find room for some forgiveness.\n\nThose therapists were patronizing and worthless.  Therapy is no good to someone who doesn't want it, and [therapist1] was not worth whatever you paid him for the years you dragged me there.  Lest we forget, you dragged me to [therapist2] to put me on ADHD meds as a condition of getting my driver's permit.  And then you let [brother] get his six months later, the week he turned 16 without so much as a note of caution to him.  Is that the price of being \"special\" and \"gifted\"?  You can shove those terms where the sun don't shine.\n\nI've already forgiven you.  But that has nothing to do with you; I'm already bitter and jaded at the world and my childhood, I don't need some extra luggage of caustic hate at you to haul around.  But just because I've forgiven you does not make everything better; you stay far away from me and the family I have built.\n\n&gt; I was proud of every single thing you did musically-from preschool on! You did [instrument1] and your teacher thought you were excellent-I was so proud of you for how you practiced and performed. You did not like it, so you let me know by dropping [instrument1] off the top bunk. Although I was not happy that it broke, I was proud of you for letting me know. I did sit down to talk with you about it-without any yelling. I could tell that you were too young to express how you were feeling, but you unequivocally did not want [instrument1] to be part of your life. I remain proud that you showed your true feelings.\n\nNot what you said when it happened; and there was yelling.\n\n&gt; I was proud when you took up [instrument2] and did well at that. You did [lots of musical stuff]: it was a big part of your life, and I was so proud of you. You even took up [instrument3] and some composing or orchestrating parts for [music teacher].  And you looked so incredibly handsome in a tux. I went to every concert and was proud of you for every speck of your musical accomplishments.\n\n&gt; I was so proud of you taking and excelling at [subject]. And I was even more proud that you let me be a part of that by relearning what I knew and working with you on it. In the end, you surpassed my knowledge, and I was, and remain, so proud of you. You earned the school [subject] prize, and I was proud of you for that.\n\nAs I recall, you were constantly on me to do my homework, and yelling when I didn't do it.  If that's what you call \"helping\", maybe you should go \"help\" yourself.  \n\n&gt; I was proud of how you handled [stepbrother]. He was often a jerk and a bully, and I bet there were things he said and did when I wasn’t around that were awful. However, you defused the situations without creating chaos, which I thank you for. When he was an even bigger jerk than usual at one of our house parties, by being mean to [friend's brother] you stood up to him and came and found me to let me know. I was so proud of you for making sure that stopped.\n\n[Stepbrother] was a jerk who was raised by [stepfather]; the man you married.  Like father like son.  \n\n&gt; I was proud of you for all your Lego creations. You loved the Lego kits and would race to put them together as on the box. Then you would dismantle them and make your own unique structures. It was messy but so creative!\n\n&gt; I was proud of you for how you learned to cook and bake (remember the morning you woke me up with homemade muffins?) and have carried that on through your whole life! I was proud that you knew to use the fire extinguisher the time you and [brother] decided to make pasta while I was out, too!\n\n&gt; I was proud of how you taught yourself to read-without my even knowing-no one helping you! I have never known anyone who did that! What a sign of your intelligence.\n\n&gt; I was proud of how with your powers of observation, you taught yourself math concepts early on, too. I had you putting cupcake liners in tins and counting them to keep you busy while I was making dinner and you stopped me to tell me that you didn’t need to count them, they were in rows of three. You were about three and had realized the concept of multiplication!\n\nI also observed you and Dad fighting all the time, and you being difficult with and taking advantage of cashiers, and you driving agressively, and you breaking things to vent your anger.  I observed you running to other men for comfort after the divorce.  I observed you blaming Dad for all the flaws in your first marriage.  I observed a whole lot.\n\n&gt; I was proud of your grades-you graduated in the top 20% (15?) of your class-that is a huge accomplishment. I was also proud of how hard you applied yourself to studying for the SAT-you raised your scores 120 points! That’s amazing!\n\nRecall that you forced me to go to that SAT prep class and take the test again; my scores were already ahead of the curve, but nooooo, I had to be better because I was \"special\" and \"gifted\".  And why the hell should I care how good I did in school?  It wasn't good enough for you.  I'm willing to bet if you had the ability to force me to retake high school for a better grade, you would.\n\n&gt; I know I gave you a hard time about your grades; I nagged you a lot. Not only had I seen evidence of a very superior intellect very young (the two examples above), but professionals had told me you were a genius. In nursery school, a friend going for her Ph.D. at [ivy league university] needed to give intelligence tests, so I allowed her to test you. The results were incredibly high-she was the one who made me realize I had to do whatever it took to get you to the best school system we could afford. Unfortunately, it took five years to sell that house! In middle school, [bulls hit therapist #1] had me take you to another round of these tests; again, it came back extremely high. [Bullshit therapist #2] in Branford also told me you were one of the brightest kids he had ever worked with. Many adults did. I am guilty of often conveying my dissatisfaction with your grades, as I never stopped believing you were capable of genius or near genius work. But I was also proud of them, especially how you upped your effort by taking two math courses in 10th grade and working so hard in 11th and 12th.\n\nWorked so hard... I hated it.  You forced me to work so hard.  I didn't have any dreams after school of what I wanted to be, I just wanted the pain of living with you to stop.  I just wanted it all to stop. How the hell I wasn't suicidal those last few years, I will never know.  If I had the correct social circles at the time, you bet your ass I would have been stoned and high all the time!  \n\n&gt; I was proud of how you were a great pet owner-that may sound silly, but not all kids are good to their pets. You loved [childhood dog](and later the cats) and treated her so well.\n\nYou do recall the four or five hamsters I killed through neglect?  I do.  I also recall after dog died, you called Dad, the man who almost choked you to death, to bury the dog and then collapsed into his arms sobbing about the dog, how she can't be dead.  It disgusted me, how you could sat all these negative things about him, and then run to his arms when the world got too emotionally heavy.\n\n&gt; You and [brother] had your spats and bad moments, as all brothers will, but you were a great big brother, and still are. Yes, I am proud of you for that.\n\n&gt; I was proud of you as an artist. You didn’t think you were good at art, but when you were young, you did great in art classes, and again, your teachers pulled me aside to tell me you had a real talent. I tried complimenting you and putting your art work up at home, but it wasn’t enough to convince you.\n\n&gt; I was proud of how hard you worked in [sport1] classes in [hometown1]. You had [diagnosis] (as I did when I was young), your doctor told me to take you to lessons, and have you [sport1] all the time to stop it from getting worse. You were [good at sport1] and it not only didn’t progress, but it disappeared! You were so fast in [sport1], and your form was so good, that your coach wanted you to join his competitive team. You didn’t want to, so I didn’t make you, but I was so very proud of you.\n\nYou forced me to go do a sport.  I didn't want to do any of them, but you still signed me up anyway.  The bullying was the worst in the sports teams.  I didn't even realize I had the option to say \"no\" until high school.\n\n&gt; I was proud of how you did [sport2] for many years and then [sport3]. I realized years ago in hindsight that you stuck through [sport2] for more years than you wanted to for me. I thank you for that. I wanted you to be physically fit and didn’t know what other sports to go with after you turned down [sport1] (you did not want basketball!). I also naively thought the team would be a good way for you to make friends and become part of the community in [hometown2]. But you stuck with it through junior year, and that was true grit.\n\nNo, that was you having told me for so long that I needed to do a sport, any sport, that I was actually afraid of not being on a team.\n\n&gt; I could write more, much more, but this is already 4 pages. Enjoy your anniversary. Know that I loved you, always loved you with all my heart, and always have been proud of you.\n\nYou are fifteen years too late.  Actually, you're twenty years too late.  I needed to hear and internalize this a whole lot sooner.  But I didn't.  I wonder why...\n\n&gt; Love,\n\n&gt; ~~Mom~~ Valerie (she doesn't get to use that title anymore)\n\n \n\n\n\n",

I’ve been planning for this since I was like 10 years old (24 now) as leaving my family was one of my childhood dreams. I’m not even in an ideal/stable life situation (wanted to wait until I had a stable career/a decent amount of money before NC), but even VLC with my Ns causes me distress and it’s like I’m still wearing a ball and chain. I realized I won’t be able to be truly free and successful with them contacting me and slipping in their venom which causes endless relapses, triggers, flashbacks, etc. The ultimate act of self-care and desire to move on and up in life is going NC from these people! I won’t lie and say I’m not horribly terrified. I’m scared they’ll hunt me down after I go NC. \n\nI’m contemplating writing a one-way message to them as a goodbye/don’t try to contact me any further notice... I’d appreciate if you guys have any ideas for the message. I know it’s not necessary, but I it’s closure for me. I kinda want them to know I’m going NC vs disappearing randomly \n\nI’m getting ready for the first step into living my dreams with NC!!!",

        "text": "Hello community,\n\nI am glad to have educated myself on what I am going through by reading much of the literature and posts on this for a few months. It has helped me gain much insight - yet of course that is only the first step. I know I am just beginning my healing journey. I am also posting on CPTSD as many of my symptoms align with that. \n\nMost recently my biggest hurdle is dissociation. I understand this is a maladaptive coping mechanism that we often develop in childhood to \"deal\" with the emotional trauma we are suffering. \n\nQuick background. I am no longer in contact with my Narcissistic mother, I just realized this about 2 years ago - that she/was is an abusive that is- prior to that I was brainwashed by her and believed all she said. \nI got married one year ago to an incredible loving man and during this time her emotional torture was so terrible I knew I had to make a change. I have been no contact for 6 months. \n\nWhat is interesting is that I can almost pinpoint times in my life as an adult I felt detached from my emotions when something terrible was happening, and on the contrary very in touch. I see now after the above 2 years or so, it's really the latter, it is always dissociation. I can feel for small things, and I feel true love for my dog (I know sounds strange) but for all else and even my new husband it is quite flat or detached. \n\nAnyway I am looking to find a therapist that works with this once I relocate soon. I wanted to hear your thoughts and advice and stories - and what helped you. Or anything you may have to say :) ",

Still no success but graduating college early next year so that's promising). I was discarded in July of 2017, hoovered in February of 2018 but I told her that there is no going back. Since then, have been maintaining a safe distance from her despite the fact we work together. Because of that, I am nice to her face but I don't let her close to me. She recently admitted to think I was still pining for her and I told her that I don't pine for her at all. She seemed to take it well and said she'd like for us to stay friends. I'm extremely scared of her and I don't know what to do in this situation. She recently had another supply (her other ex girlfriend) but she's now discarded her, and I'm triggered and absolutely scared out of my mind she's coming after me.\n\nShe's never threatened me but gaslighted the absolute hell out of me and still tries to. She even admitted to gaslighting me, which makes me question whether she truly is an N or just an emotional abuser. The idealise, devalue and discard relationship cycle is absolutely on point with our relationship. Has anyone else experienced their N admitting to abusive behaviour?\n\nI can't shake the feeling that doom is impending. I was diagnosed with PTSD, which is hard as I was already wired as an anxious person and have been in therapy for anxiety for a while. I feel like my N is either going to murder me or have me framed and sent to jail. I am so convinced I'm going to jail for whatever manipulative bull she can come up with that I'm preparing for it. I feel suicidal.  I feel helpless and crazy. Has anyone else had experiences like this?\n\nI've set very firm boundaries and she knows I'm no longer here to be her punching bag or wanting a relationship with her. Is it possible she will leave me alone now she knows I'm not here to be those things?\n\nPs. I'm sorry if this is scattered, but it's hard to really put into words how I'm feeling and thinking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "So I dated my boyfriend for three months. I’ll tell you the story though I’m sure you’ve all heard it before. \nWe met on Bumble. He was smart, sexy, funny. Everything I thought I wanted.  He love bombed me real good. Calling me his future wife, telling me how he had waited so long for the right woman, calling me sweet pet names, romantic gestures. Telling me every day, several times a day how beautiful he thought I was, how he had “won the lottery” by finding me. \nBut I look back now and there were red flags I didn’t even know were flags.\n “You’ll tell me how much you love me often right?  I need to hear that”\n“Are you eager to please me?”\n“You’ll have sex with me whenever I want right?”\nWe spent a magical weekend together, and the day after it was over it was like a switch flipped. He became an asshole overnight. When I made an offhand comment about how quickly things were progressing between us he told me I was “ruining his good feelings”. And I got my first silent treatment. Then the devalue phase began. And last the rest of our relationship. \nHe would accuse me of cheating constantly. He would imply that I was a slut. He would never commit to seeing me, I would have to beg. He would tell me it was my fault he was treating me bad. Because when he treated me well I acted “crazy”. Anytime I would question why he avoided conversations about the status of our relationship he would ignore me. Any slight could lead to another silent treatment which always lasted for days and days. \nHe forgot my birthday and never even acknowledged or apologized. \nI have a young son, and he would often tell me I was babying him. And he couldn’t understand how I could miss him when I traveled for work. \nI found out a few things about his that explain his ways:\n- he never knew his father until he was 16 or 17\n- his mother ignored him for most of his childhood and when he turned 18 she moved back to El Salvador and left him\n- he told me once during the love bomb phase that he “didn’t receive any love as a child”\n- he has no friends\n- he lives to work. He’s incredibly detail oriented\n- he has never lived with anyone. He doesn’t enjoy going out\n- he has no sense of humor. Like barely ever laughs at anything except if It was embarrassing about me\n\nTwo weeks ago I returned from travel (during which he insisted I was picking up other men). And I spent the night with him. I thought it was our most intimate time together ever. I felt like we really connected. I remember massaging his feet after we had sex and he commented “I feel like this is something people would do in a relationship” I remember thinking that was an odd thing to say. Like he didn’t know what a real relationship was like?  \nAnyway, the day after that night together he stopped talking to me. I haven’t heard from him since. I sent dozens of texts to no avail. I feel like my heart has been ripped out. Of course I googled “how to deal with the silent treatment”. And after reading article and article I realized what he was and what had happened.im ashamed that I still want him back. I want back the man I thought he was anyway. I want back his sweet and kind words that were so few and far between. I want back the fleeting intimacy we shared when we slept together. I miss him. And I hate myself for it. ",

        "text": "I've been dealing with a family breakdown now for the past 2 years almost. I have had to leave them as they are all narcissitic and have bought into their group delusional narrative. None of them are willing to let that go, apart from myself (the scapegoat). \n\nI have some support, in the shape of friends I knew 20 years ago, but I never knew them that well.. point being they have offfered me some support, but not ongoing support. And my 'best' friend is in bad trouble with alcohol, so he is out of the picture. And in any case, he is an alcoholic and narcissist himself - of course my friends have all been narcissists, as I was unaware of the dynamic set up through my developmental years. \n\nAnyway, I went to go for a run last night, feeling out of sorts with a head cold, but went anyway. And I met a guy I used to go to college with, and live with about 20 years ago. He was their with his young kids. I am a very avoidant person, but I hadn't seen him in so long that I said I best go over to him and say hi. \n\nLong story short, within a minute of speaking with him I told him that I have issues with my parents. The conversation carried on, and we got to talking about work, and what we are both doing. But, in hindsight, I shouldn't hve mentioned anything about m family issues to him. I did live with him 20 years ago, and he knew some problems I had in the past - so maybe I felt like I could trust him. But it wasn't right. Plus, I think he might be some form of 'caring narcissist' himself.\n\nOn my run it occured to me that it was one of my parts that told this guy about my family troubles. It wasn't my adult part, but one of my younger parts. I have read Janina Fisher's book on part work, and am now thinking I should read it again. \n\nIt feels like a never-ending battle sometimes though, and all I want is some human contact, and warmth. And that's why I opened up to that guy so immediately. It's hard walking around alone knowing your family is so terribly insecure that they have to hate on their own children to survive. It's the definition of tragic. \nI just have to emphasize to myself that this is the pain I must use to eventually find my true self. If I keep pushing forwards, through the challenge, I will get there. \n\nHave you found yourself opening up to people too quickly? Even after a year or two of being aware of the perils of Narcissism? \n\nI was glad to know that I had this sub-reddit to come back to and let out my concerns. It's all a learning process, I suppose. It's so hard to trust people, and yet there I was letting out my personal issues to a guy I hadn't seen in twenty years, and knew he wasn't exactly a saint to begin with. \n\nSorry if this post rambles a bit. I'd like to hear your thoughts on isolation, and how it tends to bring about both seemingly opposite behaviours of a) not trusting anyone and yet b) suddenly opening up to someone way too much (as you have to try to trust someone). \n\nI suppose the root problem is I still don't trust myself enough, as I haven't yet found my true self amidst the emotional torment of my dysfunction family. \n\nReally, for those of us who have came from dysfunctional narcissitic families, our primary aim should be to trust ourselves first, shouldn't it be? \n\nThanks for reading.

        "text": "This summer, I got pushed past the brink. I'm 36, and I should have left my family in the dust like I had the instinct to do in my early 20s, after college. Unfortunately, I got shamed / guilted into sticking around, and then nmom got sick, and it became much harder to escape the toxic dynamic. After nmom died a few years ago, I thought things might heal with the rest of us. Unfortunately, that's when it became clear that my nfather was just as responsible for the constant warfare in my family, the relentless pitting of siblings against one another. It all crested this summer when I was kicked out of the family home, where I was staying because I was inbetween apartments (there was a fire and subsequent construction in my previous building). I was kicked out, literally, because I addressed my sister in law (spouse of my golden child / narc older brother) in the wrong tone. It didn't matter what I actually said to her (inquiring if she was mad at me about something), it was that I apparently \"threatened\" her by doing so (and the threatening was done by my tone, apparently). So.. kicked out of the house. Well, that brought the trauma all up to the surface again.\n\nSo anyway... settled into my new apartment, one day I just can't turn off the tears, and I'm just sobbing and sobbing and grieving. And I realize that I don't want any of them in my life anymore, and now that my mom's dead, I can move on without \"guilt\" just like I should have 14 years ago. After my family got back from a trip they all took together (I wasn't invited, of course) my father reached out to see if I would go to another session of grief counseling with him (I had previously attended one session with him, at my suggestion, bc I thought his therapist would make him hear me. The therapist actually helped me bc he said that he understood if I wanted to go no contact with everyone since I was the scapegoat, and that I shouldn't feel bad about being a scapegoat because this is a dynamic that gets set into place long before I was even born). So, ironically, the therapist made me feel empowered about going no contact, which is what I had the instinct to do so many years ago.\n\nSo, long story short, I responded to my dad's request to go to therapy again by saying that he should check back with me in a month, because it was a harrowing summer, and I have a lot on my plate right now. I just didn't have the energy to direct to this. Well, it's been almost a month now, and I'm dreading that he will get in touch with me again. It keeps me up at night and gnaws at my stomach. I really just don't want to see any of them for a long, long time but the fear of the drama and further bullying is what eats at me. I want to find a way to take the space I need without having to declare \"I don't want you in my life anymore.\" Some have suggested that simply ghosting, evaporating out of their lives, is preferable, and for me it very much is. I just don't know how to deal with the dread and anticipation I feel for this miserable encounter that is probably coming soon.\n\nEdit: the reason I don't want to have to declare that I don't want to see him anymore is because my father is HIGHLY aggressive, and if you give him an inch, he'll take a mile. I've been his dumping ground for rage, and the slightest thing will set him off. So I'd just rather not say anything at all. But, what *do* I say?",

They want you to be dependent on them for their approval/advice/support/validation.\n\nWhen you become dependent, they can enjoy an enormous amount of control over your emotional stability. They can choose to play withholding games with their affection and attention, and suddenly begin treating you like a nuisance and like they don't have time for you. They will be cool and distant, and unavailable if you need them, where before they'd rush to your side with advice and support if you so much as stubbed your toe.\n\nDuring these aloof periods, when you feel like you have to chase after them for their attention, they might make passive aggressive comments that are subtle put downs, and other covert jabs and snide remarks. They will question your judgment and make you doubt yourself, where before they were always so supportive! Suddenly they might start ignoring your text messages, or take a long time to respond, where normally they read and reply quickly. You can't put your finger on it, but something has shifted, and you are feeling ignored, like you've been demoted and are now considered low priority.\n\nThen the winds change again, and they snap back to being your #1 supporter. You are expected to open up and share your innermost thoughts and struggles for their inspection, and many of your conversations with them will be more like therapy sessions. Without even being aware of it, you will gradually become dependent on their approval.\n\nI believe that this type of N experiences their grandiosity by ministering to their brood of wounded souls. They see themselves as superior to you. The entire dynamic is built around them playing therapist and confidante, to you, the troubled one. The focus will be on you opening up and spilling your guts. I think it gives them a great sense of power to worm their way into a person's confidence and win them over, and make the person trust and depend on them. They want to have a lot of influence over their dependents, and I think this gives them their supply, when their mood (whether they are hot or cold, aloof or warm &amp; available) controls another person's emotions.\n\nWhen they become distant and passive aggressive and critical, you will doubt your own perceptions, bc you are so used to them being warm and supportive. You will let things slide, their little digs and demeaning comments, and the evidence of their grandiosity and arrogance, bc it conflicts so much with the person you believed them to be, the person who lovebombed you and took you under their wing and gave you so much flattering praise.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else here has encountered this kind of N? I would love to hear your story.",

I’m very happy for the first time in a long time. \n\nAunts and Uncles from out of town visited my little family once this year but apparently have been visiting the state like 2+ times more than they led me to believe and have visited my Nmom (it’s her siblings and their spouses) and her nhusband each time. Apparently it’s been really weird for them and Nmom made a comment to one of them that she might want to reconcile with me. \nI think it’s pretty damn cowardly for her to say it like that. If she wants to she can contact me and not put others in the middle of things. She has some of my information, I think she is trying to make herself look better by saying that to them.\nBut who knows really. Only 1 of my aunts really understands the gravity of the situation and is very disappointed in Nmom. Everyone else thinks I’m being immature and selfish. \nAnyways. I told my aunt that the only way I would speak with her is if we had a therapist or moderator between us and her husband isn’t allowed to come. (He screamed at me and called me the c-word the last time we spoke while I was holding my baby, and his whole family hates me and is loud about it)\n\nI have doubts she will contact me, she is great at making herself the victim.

Have you experienced reconnecting after NC? A part of me wants to just let it all out and tell her that she abused me verbally and physically and why we are NC. Another part of me thinks it’s just fuel for her to be the victim again and make me the bad guy again.

But only recently have I learned to actively say no and put up boundaries.\n\nBut my Nmom is getting older, and actually needs help.  She's widowed and living alone in Florida.  I know she is lonely and miserable.  It's hard because I am also pretty lonely and miserable, but I know I absolutely cannot make any connection with her.  Yet I know how much it can hurt, so when *anyone* is feeling like that, my natural inclination is to help.\n\nBut it's gotten to the point that I know she needs actual help.  She fell a couple months ago, and broke her arm.  She wants to move to a more manageable house, but doesn't have anyone to help her move.  She's always taken advantage of me in the past, but now I know she needs legit old-people help.  But I am completely tapped out with her and just can't be around her.  I feel so guilty about this.\n\nHow do you handle this?  Anyone go through anything similar?",

        "text": "I have a 11-year-old son who I see 3 times per week &amp; he lives with his mum who I separated from 5 years ago. At the time I wasn’t very knowledgeable on relationship dynamics but after I separated I started researching things &amp; also working on myself. The main reason for this is that I was clinically depressed at the time &amp; my ex constantly said I had mental issues &amp; I got to the point where I believed I had. Over the last few years I have realised that it wasn’t me with the problem it was her. When I was in the relationship I could never put my finger on the problem. It was like I knew something was wrong, but I couldn’t figure out why &amp; I could never put it into words. I do believe now that she is narcissistic &amp; I would just like some opinions whether this seems to be the case?\n\nShe would constantly undermine me with our child. If I was trying to get him to sleep in his own bed &amp; he started making a fuss she would allow him to come down stairs &amp; If I protested she would call me out on it &amp; label me as awful or nasty for trying to get him into a bedtime routine.\n\nShe would lie where ever possible instead of owning up to something when it was obvious she was lying \n\nThis is one I find it hard to describe &amp; I will give an example. If my son was misbehaving or wasn’t doing as he was told instead of telling him off she would say something like “stop doing that or your dad will go in a mood” it’s as if she was making me look bad for getting annoyed when my son was misbehaving even if I wasn’t mad. This really frustrated me to be honest. It was as if she was saying that I was wrong for getting mad over something that my son was doing which was clearly wrong in the first place &amp; instead of her been upfront with him &amp; chastising him she manipulated the situation to get him to do what she wanted &amp; at the same time make me look like the bad one. She still does this to this day.\n\nShe blames my son for everything, if she knocks a cup off coffee over, he made her do it.\n\nShe promises things like holidays with him &amp; has no intention of taking him or she knows it’s not possible but still promises him then lets him down at the last minute\n\nTo get him to behave she would often use guilt or threaten him. For instance, if he was misbehaving she would run to the front door &amp; pretend to be shouting to a police officer outside.\n\nShe has done things in the past which I would class as bad parenting decisions like substance abuse. When I have confronted her about this she isn’t concerned that the thing she is doing is bad for my son, she is more concerned about how it would make her look if people found out. Her favourite phrase is ‘people know I’m not a bad mom’ or she would say ‘are you trying to say I’m a bad mom’.\n\n",

        "text": "So, I have this neighbor family that my nuclear family is fairly close to. We live in a very rural setting and not many people live around, so it's nice to know there's other people near that we can hopefully count on if a vehicle is stuck or some other type of emergency happens. The matriarch (and there's really no other word to use for her, as she's totally the boss of everyone there) is a fairly nice woman, very down to earth, helpful most of the time. But...\n\nShe is totally ALL ABOUT HERSELF and totally living inside of her own head. No matter what, *every* conversation is about her or through her filter. Now, I'm somewhat used to this because both my father and my sister are total NPD types, but I've never seen a case this bad. Not only this, but she also MONOPOLIZES every conversation so that nearly every single second is her talking. It's almost impossible to get in a word and if you do, she says \"Uh huh\" casually, without even giving any recognition to what you say, and then just keeps right on talking. \n\nThe most galling is when *I've called her* to tell her something important about us or our lives or what is happening over here. I get about 2 sentences out and then from that point on it's all about her view on the subject again, immediately followed by various things that are not connected at all to it. She apparently loves the sound of her own voice.\n\nAnother typical symptom is her schedule run-down: What she or members of her family have been doing earlier, what they're going to do today and what they plan on doing the rest of the week. This is her favorite thing (beside telling about all their meals) and she does this every single phone call and then gets off the phone.\n\nIt's *astounding* that you can have a 30-minute conversation with someone and NOT ONCE do they ask how you are feeling or doing or what you've been up to. It's like there is zero interest in us as human beings other than the fact that we possess a working set of ears and a cell phone. The *only* reason I put up with it (and have not said anything, but I'm very tempted) is because she and her family are the only people we have as neighbors. But every call leaves me feeling drained and bummed and many times I just don't answer or make an excuse to get off the phone - and even that is hard to do against a barrage of words!",

        "text": "But I'm free, I fight for values, s, and I never gave up, never will I.\n\n\nMy last NC move was moving out of desperate necessity, I understood things were going so bad I had to choose to show my claws (the term I use for a person with extreme dissociation using different strategies) or die after a long life of abuse. The monsters who already saw me gone once were doing all they could do to destroy me. The recovery has already been expensive with food, shelter, and therapy. At the moment I'm left with $50 after I lost a lot of the money in critical unexpected things. I've plans and ideas, and I'm not looking for advice (also, I'm not going open my heart and my story with dudes I'll stop talking to the following day, to be honest. And if I do, may I continue to learn only doing what I truly want), consider this as vent. \n\n\nI think the thing that sucks most is nobody does anything to stop abuses, who is lucky is here and will hopefully go NC or already is, who is not here will be abused for God knows how long, some maybe can't even post Internet. Imagine if I die today, who is gonna look up for me (excluding a borderline and narcissistic missing the toy)? Imagine the same for the ones abused. Imagine how many cases of abused children there are we are not aware of. In my school, there used to be a once a year 10 minutes of silence for the deaths caused by Nazis. I'd like the same for the abused children (the one who couldn't save themselves). I consider all the person with such difficult stories brother and sisters. So yeah, I'm not going to let this go forever if you want to hear something cool. The thing that always kept me strong enough to survive was values, I had no friends, no help, nothing. My goal has always been Be different, be a good father, have a good family. I added another one: to make the ones working in the social sector and public/psychiatrists in Italy start recognizing abuse and stop forcing dudes into abusive houses. This is for Italy (my native country) but I'd like more activism around the world too, as I'm sure there are many countries with sad stories, Reddit is often populated by people who  don't have troubles with money (don't dare starting an argument with me till you try malnutrition because you can't afford food), but poor people must have even worst stories. As a rule of thumb, the more the isolation, the stronger the abuse and lessen the chances the child is gonna be saved, this is my opinion.\n\n\n I can't sleep if I don't tell myself one day things will be better and people will know what's going on in abusive homes. I have the guts, and I hope a lot of action will join me, this is my dream. I could also be a businessman and make a shelter with a rule that who is saved has to donate afterward, most abused children have such a potential the shelters wouldn't have any problems, as long as people who would work more for the money and less for the values are kept away. People like to invest in all kind of useless things, the ones participating in such a project would invest in giving basic opportunities to people who never had them.\n\n\nGrammar: I'm not native, grammar nazis, don't f..with me.",

        "text": "I believe my mother to be a covert passive aggressive style of N, which means she doesn't bully you with explosive displays of N rage (that's my father). She is a master of turning on you with sudden coldness that is so powerful it can take your breath away. Her abuse currency is snide passive aggressive remarks that I believe are designed to demean you and to keep you in your place. I am the family scapegoat, so I've had to deal with her Jekyll and Hyde personality more than anyone (she has a sugary sweet, doting mama persona who always says \"I love you!\", while out the other side of her mouth there's these snide snarky bullying comments and the cold hearted dismissive selfishness).\n\nA few months ago I was home for a family reunion (my parents live 1000 miles from me). My mother had her cell phone open next to me and I saw that the pic she had saved as my profile pic, was this unbelievably unflattering image of me from my N sister's wedding in 2016. During that period of time, I was still with my first N boyfriend, who was evil incarnate and I was in abusive relationship hell. I had put on a lot of weight, and I showed up to that wedding looking like shit, like I'd been through a war. It was one of the worst time periods of my life, and N sister happened to get married in the middle of it. I hate seeing any pics of me from that wedding weekend bc they are evidence of how truly miserable I was at that time.\n\nSomehow my mother selected one of the worst photos of me, one that I hadn't even seen before - it wasn't taken by the wedding photographers. I was on the dance floor and happened to look round at the picture taker and I looked dumpy and had this stupid expression on my face. Just for emphasis, I actually split the back of my dress that night. And this is the pic that my mom chooses to use for me in her cell phone! She claimed, when I called her out, that it was a new phone and she didn't have any other pics of me. Yeah right. She could ask me for a new one, or use one of the dozens and dozens of pics my photographer father has on his laptop. Or she could just not use a pic for me at all, til she got hold of a good one. The fact she chose this unflattering pic of me from my sister's wedding (where my mother chose to publicly make her snide bullying remarks on several occasions and embarrass me), speaks volumes.\n\nSo that's my mother.\n\nNow it's 2018, I'm long out of that awful N relationship, and I've formed a great group of friends with people from a Meetup for loved ones of Ns. I also have other friends, a couple of whom I've known for 15+ years. My mother likes to make snide remarks about my social life, which admittedly withered a lot during the years I was with my N exes (isolation is an incredibly common side effect of abusive relationships). But it's been coming back to life the last year, and the last 6 months it's been flourishing.\n\nMy mother, though, still likes to characterize me in this veiled snarky way, as a friendless loser. My N sister does the same thing. It's like the \"sad little person\" role has been assigned to me in the family script, and I am expected to continue playing that part, no matter what is *actually* going on in my life.\n\nSo my mother likes to repeatedly ask me what I did over the weekend (this was her favorite question during the time period when I was isolated bc of my first N ex). Nowadays, she likes to ask what I did over the weekend with \"that group\" (she means the Meetup group friends I've made). The implication is that *they are all I have.* I don't have any other friends. *I'm still the sad loser I always was.* One time I confronted her, when she was yet again asking what I did over the weekend with \"those people.\" I said that I have other friends too. She came back with, \"You hang out with them and with \\[So and So\\] right?\" So and So is one of my oldest friends. The comment was demeaning - it was meant to imply that my social life is still limited, that I'm still basically friendless, even though this couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nI just told her in reply that it's sad she's gotten so out of touch with my life.  :-)\n\n**I wondered if anyone posting here has a N parent who specializes in snide, snarky, passive aggressive remarks designed to make you feel like a loser?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I’ve learned so much here, so I very thankful for that.\n\nI want to show you my specific family dynamics. Hopefully you guys can shed some light and/experience.\n\nGrowing up, I was the gc. My family, especially my mother, would shower me with love. I have 3 younger siblings.\n\nAs a child, I somehow instinctively used so many narc tactics with my siblings. Triangulation, silent treatment, etc., I really exhibited really bad narcissistic behaviour, and so I was unable to bond with my 2 younger brother. Instead I spreaded shame and toxicity. I am of course very remorseful now. The pain now runs deep. \n\nAfter studying, and learning all I can about this affliction, I’ve seen the harms and evil I used to do.  \n\nI am now trying to mend fences, and foster growth and closeness with my siblings. I try to engage positively, create great feelings. However , I can feel the enmity, maybe slight hostility with me. This is all subconscious. I’m not sure where their awareness levels are. However communicating is so hard. \n\nI feel like my brothers have many fleas, and are perhaps unconscious of how they behave?\n\nThe full circle thing I’m referring to is, have any gc’s come fully around, self actualized, and reunited with your siblings? Having some type of brotherly love and real communication? In a sense, I’m kind of being scapegoated by my siblings. \n\n\n",

My Nmom took out a Parent Plus loan in the last year of school that is due every month currently that she can definitely afford but refuses to refinance and pressures me to make payments to. It is her responsibility and under her name, and she has MY contact information in the system and I have to call in with the last four numbers of HER social to make payments, and it is based on HER income which is over double what I make.  I have made six full payments to it so far, which I had to stop two payments ago because it was making me fall behind in my rent, groceries, car, medical expenses etcetera. \n\nSince I let Nmom know I can't make payments to this as of now, she has left me alone, changed the email and started to finally make payments. I told her, that when I start making more money from the new job I got promoted to, THEN I'll THINK about helping her. If I can't afford HER loan, what does she want me to do?...Mind you, I have kept up to date with all the loans under both my AND her name, which make up like 80% of my total school loans so I'm taking care of it  and have made generous payments to it because I'm trying to fix my credit, which with careful monitoring and life changes I've been able to get up to a good score :)\n\nShe has told me she doesn't care about if the govt takes her house away or throws her in jail, because symbolically it was for my school and she won't even try to help herself and call and make a damn payment of even $10.00. She wants to guilt-trip me into making payments for her and continues to bitch about her own financial situation. She KNOWS she can afford it and I can't. SHE is the one who took out the loan, and I didn't hold a gun to her head for her to take it out. It was HER decision. She has horrible credit because of HER horrible choices. I make half as much as her, have no kids and have everything under control. Someone explain this to me lol.\n\nAnyway, she keeps telling my grandma, who comes from a third-world country and has never had a post-secondary education, and my two younger sisters that I don't pay my school loans...??? She only tells her side of the story and try to make me look irresponsible, but I don't have an irresponsible bone in my body Hahahah.  And they always bring it up against me as if it's something I should be ashamed of when I'm doing fine and the one that should be ashamed is nMom. \n\nNsis and Esis are both 7-8 years younger and have already been to jail for petty crimes, at their ages they have not accomplished as much as I have at their age, still live in Nmom's house and have a lot of other issues dealing with people that I never had. They really think they have me with the student loan and I'm sitting over here like \"and what about it??\" I just tell them to mind their business and don't pay attention to their bullying remarks.

I don't care.  I have this apathetic attitude towards them.  I no longer have this anger that wells up in my stomach when I talk about what they did to me.  I talk about what happened like it's a fact and emotion doesn't come out of it anymore like it used to.  I dont care about them anymore.  I dont care what they do or what they say about me.  They feel so distant to me.  Like they're dead already.   However, I get fearful still when they find ways to meddle with my life and  I talk about what they did to me and get hyper-focused about it.  So no vengeance, no anger, but still fearful.

And i might have suspected that he really wanted to hurt me. But after that he made fun of me in front of his friends, these guys that were in his band. \n\nI remember feeling completely cut off from him at that point, and the child version of “well, there’s nothing i can do in this situation to fix this.” And I think I felt sad about this.\n\nAnd this is STILL the way that I feel when, as an adult, a boss or a manager decides to try to make a punching bag of me. \n\nI am sad, because there is nothing that I can do to fix the situation. That person’s got his own problems he’s gotta fix. \n\nAnd I also go by “When people show you who they are, believe them.” \n\nSo do I have to smile at him anymore? Hell no. I will ignore his ass from now on, and do my job and bide my time until I can get the fuck out of there. \n\nWhy do human beings do this shit to each other? \n\nIf I was four when my dad dropped me, and then punished me by teasing me in front of his friends and withholding love from me, and preferring my little sister over me, is he still responsible? For something that probably happened in 1982? When he was 29? \n\nIf my dad is a dumb wop who didnt finish high school, and HIS dad was the same plus traumatized by WWII, and HIS dad was the same but traumatized by WWI, how mad can I be about this? \n\nIf I am figuring this shit out and it brings me peace, but I can’t be around my toxic family, then all of the programming that our society crams down our throats about family being a sacred institution needs a major pop culture overhaul. \n\nTV shows, movies, pop culture needs to start portraying the family as what it is. \n\n",

It's a wonderful place, I feel safe, and people have been so welcoming.   Emotionally, I felt a transition inside that I was happy... really happy, such that all the crap was worth it just to be where I'm at.  They don't know I've moved.  I never put up a for sale sign and my house was on the market a whopping 5 days (a house my mother always called a dump).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I get this phone call from Switzerland - aka my GC brother.  I thought he was blocked, but it was one of the many numbers I had to block after NC and I must have passed it over.  I didn't recognize the number so I let it go to voicemail.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's blocked now.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn his voicemail, his words and his tone were two different entities-  as I've come to expect.  He said he missed me and wanted to talk to me, that we hadn't talked in a long time.  He sounded pissed the whole time.  He said my enabling father, (who is almost 80) has stage 3 pancreatic cancer, in his first round of chemo and the prognosis is good.  He added that I could call him and he would fill me in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven't felt guilt in a long time, but I was battling it after this call.  I know I owe them nothing after the hell I've been through, from her abuse and their enabling of it, for turning their back on me and telling me I needed to let it go. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven though my father's lack of protecting me when I was a child, assistance with gaslighting into my adulthood, and guilt tripping when I went NC by sending me letters putting me down has caused me irreparable damage, I still have compassion for them as human beings and in a way love them.  It's hard to know what you'll feel when this happens so I didn't know how to prepare, though I knew some day it would- no one lives forever.  I had hoped the guilt would be less, if not absent.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't be responding to him or getting involved - but feel like telling my brother that he chose them and to enable their abusing me, so the parents, their house full of my mother's hoarded crap, my almost 90 y.o. mother and our now incapacitated father are his problem now.  Switzerland was the main one telling me to get over it, and I feel like telling him that if they didn't enable her, she would stop abusing me, so this is on them...but I know it would not do any good.  They will never change, so why waste my voice and mental real estate.  I finally realized that 3 years ago...hence no contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems so odd that I finally take this step and get a point where I leave it all behind (seriously, I got rid of just about everything except my car, clothes and a TV and have started fresh)...then 2 weeks later, this.",

I didn't want to hang up on my dad in our first phone call in 10 months.}*\n\nThe conversation with Mom confirmed that we didn't have a healthy relationship. She feels betrayed and pissed. She told me repeatedly that I used to be her best friend. I told her that her last visit went very poorly, she told me that was a long time ago. I told her it was an eye-opener, she told me \"and you put it all on me\" (in other words, \"you blame me for everything and won't take any responsibility yourself\") and I shrugged (which isn't helpful over the phone) and didn't agree to anything. She passed me back to Dad and stormed off. I caught him up on the conversation since he's hard of hearing, and told him he's not responsible for my relationship with my mom.

Talk about dealing with your baggage - ammirite?! 📷;) \n\nI… I have a lot of feelings about this milestone accomplishment.\n\nI’m proud of myself. I’m a stronger, more self-assured person than I have been since I was 20. Stronger even since then, because I was still a kid with reasonable insecurities back then. But over the past 5 years - what were insecurities became failures, obsessions, weapons.\n\nI was in a relationship with someone who, brick by brick, ripped apart every single positive feeling I had about myself. I hated myself. I hated my body. I hated everything about me for never being good enough. And I punished myself for it. My life’s worth and my worth as a person, a woman, and as a partner boiled down to my body. The shape and appearance of it, what it could be, what it was, and what it wasn’t.\n\nLearning to be kind to myself has been the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. I remind myself that I’m listening to the things that I say about myself. I remind myself that the voice I hear telling me I’m not good enough - that’s not my voice - it’s his. I have worked tirelessly for months to make MY voice stronger. Louder. THE ONLY OPINION THAT MATTERS.\n\nThe last five years of my life have included many ups and downs. I want to take a moment to explore that. I want to honor the journey i’ve been on so I can understand just how resilient and powerful I truly am.\n\n[Me just 3 months after we met and 1 month after we started dating. ](https://i.redd.it/wurgfn9o33m11.png)\n\nWhen I met him (July of 2013), I had my insecurities, but I was still happy with myself. I felt like a confident, attractive woman. I felt desirable and I liked the skin I was in, imperfections and all.\n\nBut I did have some very serious issues that needed to be addressed. I was constantly seeking approval. From my friends, from my family, mostly from the father that never considered me good enough to claim. I grew up being my father’s most closely guarded secret. I have an entire side of my family tree that doesn’t have any idea I even exist. And growing up like that changes a person. I had to be the best at everything. I needed to get “A’s”, failure was not tolerated. I took extra classes. I took classes above my grade level. I graduated High School at 15 years old. I HAD TO BE AMAZING. Because if I was then maybe I could be worth claiming. Because then I’d be worth loving.\n\nSeeing a pattern yet? Because it took me 25 years to recognize that terribly designed pattern…\n\nI met my abuser when I was 20. And in me he found the perfect victim, brilliantly conditioned to seek approval. It was a match made in hell.\n\nWhen I told him that my fitness goals stemmed from a hope to cosplay my favorite comic-book hero, Raven, he latched onto that. He talked to me about how he dated someone who was overweight and how it had caused her physical damage. He talked to me about his mother and her issues with weight and how disappointing it was that she had once been such a beautiful woman. He commended me for taking ownership of my health and being passionate about it.\n\nThis is very important. He was laying down the groundwork for equating Weight with Worth. He rewarded me emotionally for being more Worthy than his ex. And he supplied me with a cautionary tale - his mother. A once beautiful woman who lost her Worth when she gained her Weight.\n\nBeing rewarded with his positive regard - it was like a drug dose for me. Finally! Someone who found me valuable enough to claim! And so began the siege on my personal regard.\n\nIn February of 2014 I moved to Seattle and he came down to help. We packed all of my stuff into a cargo van and drove from Los Angeles to Seattle. During that drive he stopped us at an In n’ Out restaurant. As we’re eating he looks over at me and says “It’s important to me that my partner is a healthy person. I wouldn’t want to start a family with you unless you’re at a healthy weight.” He further explained that it was important that I maintain my healthy weight between children. He said he would support anything I did to make my achieving and maintaining a healthy weight a priority.\n\nLooking back, this… this is an objectively horrifying thing to say to someone. Even worse - saying this to someone that you’ve been in a relationship with for 5 months and who is 500 miles away from home with all of her things in a van that you’re driving - even if I’d known better self-preservation would have inclined me to agree. But I didn’t know better. In my mind he was giving me the exact recipe for earning his commitment and love. “That makes perfect sense, I understand.” I knew my role and I knew what I had to do.\n\nBut I never could do it.\n\nHe didn’t give me a recipe. What he gave me was the Kobayashi Maru. A test I was designed to fail and an accomplishment I could never, ever achieve. Because, and this is important to understand, It’s never about what you can do for someone to love you. They don’t want you to “lose weight”. That’s NOT THEIR GOAL. What they WANT is to KNOW THEY CAN CONTROL YOU. That’s the goal. You don’t “win” when you reach the goal - they just move the goalpost.\n\nOver the course of the next 16 months I was steadily, and consistently, pushed to feel like I failed to maintain my side of the bargain.\n\nHe would point out women on TV or in real life and mention that I could look like that.  He would poke at my belly in front of friends when I raised my arms to yawn. He asked me to shave my face and my ass because he didn’t like the hair on them. (This was asked of me while taking a shower together. A shared moment turned into shame.) He told me that his parents, and especially his father, complained to him about my weight and appearance.  One night, while we lay in bed, he told me that he was disappointed that I’d given up on the goal I was so passionate about when we met.\n\nI gained 40 pounds.\n\n[2 months after the first breakup. Just after he came back. ](https://i.redd.it/171yfjfr33m11.png)\n\nI felt defeated. I felt ugly. I felt like a worthless failure.\n\nThe relationship ended and I’d never hated myself more. He ended the relationship by looking me in the eye and telling me that he couldn’t even bring himself to touch me. That he knew I wanted him to but he just didn’t want to.\n\nI broke.\n\nIt took me several months, during a horrible breakup period, to just TRY to move on. Knowing that my failures and my looks pushed him away - how could I not punish and hate myself? But finally, finally I began to start to heal.\n\nIt was like the shallowest gasp for breath of a drowning person because not long after - he came back.\n\nNow there were more hoops. I had to prove that I was the right choice. I had to prove I was better and healthier. Every day was a test.\n\nI wasn’t allowed to spend the night at his house unless I’d exercised. It was “motivation.” I once called him crying whenI had a migraine and I really didn’t want to exercise because I was afraid I’d vomit from the nausea - but I wanted to see him. His response, “Just go to the gym anyways. You don’t have to exercise but this way you won’t break the habit.”\n\nI lost 20 pounds.\n\nEven the act of living with him was something to be earned - and I just never could. He gave me the key. He told me to bring my clothes. He expected me to come home every night. But he wouldn’t tell me that I lived there. He wouldn’t let me say that I lived there. I was allowed to hold and touch - but not have.\n\nAnd he, once again, would equally punish and reward me by example. One day he saw a picture of one of his ex-girlfriend before me through mutual friends on Facebook. He pointed out that she had gained weight and lamented that she was punishing her boyfriend by forcing him to accept her weight gain.\n\nI knew exactly what he was trying to say.\n\nI gained 30 pounds.\n\n[Two weeks before the second breakup.](https://i.redd.it/q7hzmfpu33m11.png)\n\nThe relationship ended, and again I picked up the pieces of my battered self-image. And if it wasn’t made clear enough to me that my weight was a motivator and a factor - he sent me, in writing, passages of his feelings about it.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[His writing that he sent to me after the second breakup.](https://i.redd.it/br9iba7i73m11.png)\n\nMy mother flew up to help me recover; i don’t know that I could have without her. This blow - this final nail in the coffin of my esteem - it shook me completely. I didn’t know what to do or how to move on from this. WHY COULDN’T I EVER BE GOOD ENOUGH?!\n\nRemember when I said it’s never about being good enough?\n\nAfter months of therapy and help from my mother, I fought my way back to myself. I didn’t feel like I was drowning anymore - I was breathing real fresh air. I found a passion for challenging myself. For getting healthy not to reach a number but to reach an accomplishment! To finish a race and to smile and say “I did it!” I signed up for races that I was excited to complete.\n\n[My first Spartan Race. 6 months before living together. ](https://i.redd.it/xhe1kanz33m11.png)\n\nHe came back. He purported to be supportive. To be loving. To be different. In a way it was, he was different because I was. I had found my passion and my passion happened to give him the results he wanted, for a while.\n\nI lost 55 pounds.\n\nWe moved in together. My life fell apart the moment we signed the lease.\n\n[My lowest weight. Right when we started living together.](https://i.redd.it/2kxskdz143m11.png)\n\nI was at my lowest ever weight. I looked like a goddess. All muscle and tone - but it wasn’t enough. I had belly. I had jiggle. “You’re so close Serra!” “You’re going to look incredible when you’re done!”\n\nHe was never satisfied.\n\nTrue, he always called me beautiful. And that seemed to help assuage his guilt. However “beautiful” was always followed by the figurative “but”\n\nYou’re beautiful but - your facial hair. You’re beautiful but - your weight. You’re beautiful but - the shape of your ass. You’re beautiful but - think how great you’ll look if you look this good now!\n\nI gained 20 pounds.\n\n[2 months into living together.](https://i.redd.it/miy6cg7543m11.png)\n\nIt got worse. My work became a nightmare. My home was a prison. I never slept because his cats kept me awake all night. I was sleep-tortured for nearly a year. And not with normal cat behavior. He had bred in them the same needy, desperate, destructive nature that he cultivated in me. They would spend all night yowling, crying, screaming for his attention. They would violently attach one another in efforts to get his attention. They would violently attack me. \n\nAnd on top of it all - I was still never good enough. I didn’t even have love or affection for myself as comfort. \n\n[My average sleep for a period of 9 months. The red markers are the times I was woken up by his cats.](https://i.redd.it/ma1jms9743m11.png)\n\nComfort was getting out of work after a 12 hour workday, getting in my car and driving to a drive-thru, parking in the garage of my building so I could eat my dinner and cry. Crying because I was miserable and I didn’t want to go home and face him.\n\nI gained 50 pounds.\n\n[My employee badge photo for my new job. My heaviest weight.](https://i.redd.it/psplx5k943m11.png)\n\nAnd then, finally, the breaking point. It was like a switch flipped in me and instead of hanging on and continuing to try to prove myself - all I wanted was to get away.\n\nI worked in stages.\n\nI got a new, better job. Better treatment and better hours. I got my life back.\n\nI pushed for us to find subletters so we could break our lease. I moved into my own place.\n\nI didn’t know how much happier I’d be in my own place without him until it happened. I would sit around my house and feel a peace I hadn’t felt since I moved in with him. Even my DOG was happier. (No surprise as living with his cats had been a prison for her too.)\n\nI let go of the relationship and removed his hold on my mind.\n\nI went to therapy to discuss the years of conditioning and brainwashing. I found the source of my trauma - what made me a target to abusers and how my own mental conditioning and behaviors allowed the process to repeat itself.\n\nI rediscovered my love for racing. For being the Wonder Woman I always knew was inside of me - now unhindered and unleashed.\n\nI have committed myself to being single for an entire year. The purpose of this being to know myself, confidently and comfortably, so much that I will never accept another person’s version of me.\n\nSomeone at work actually recently asked me how I'm motivated to workout or eat healthy because they have a hard time with that motivation. Something I've learned about myself in my \"intentional relationship with myself\" is that the lifestyle isn't hard for me.\n\nAnd the thing is? It's not hard for me because in my heart it's not about \"eating healthy because I have to lose weight\" or \"exercising because I need to burn calories and lose weight\". It's not a chore or an obligation. And it’s not for him.\n\nIt's a genuine joy and privilege, because what I love more than anything is climbing mountains, hitting goals - just being an athlete. I AM an athlete. So everything i do - the exercise the nutrition - it's all in pursuit of challenging and furthering my athleticism.\n\nAnd what that means is that I need to be hyper-aware of people or partners who ever even HINT about making my nutrition and exercise exclusively about weight-loss.\n\nBecause people like that want to get in your head and make you feel like you’re not worthy enough exactly as you are. Behavior like that turns something you love (be it yourself or your passions) into something ugly and self-defeatist. You’ll spend your life clawing for acceptance that was NEVER THEIRS TO GIVE.\n\nSo my next partner will need to understand that I am an athlete. And they can support me, or join me, as an athlete. But that's it. That's the only relationship they're allowed to have with my training. Or with my self-image.\n\nYou’ll never be good enough for the wrong person.\n\nSo be good enough for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I, uh, may need a new badge. ;\\)](https://i.redd.it/5azq3aql73m11.png)",

Or is it realism? Is there a difference? Nothing to look forward to and, whilst I'm being honest, no hope.\n\nEverything feels like pure pitty at this stage. A laugh or a how are you is just because someone feels sorry for me.\n\nI can't take anymore disappointment. I can't keep trying over and over and not get one bit of happiness. Sometimes I feel so envious of others to have a child or a partner. The grass is always greener to be sure, and I won't kid myself into thinking that those individuals are as happy as I **think** I would be if I had either but if I felt like there'd ever be a chance of me having either I know I'd have more drive in me. But alas these things will just never happen. I'm an outsider, always have been. And lots of people have appreciated me for that very trait over the years but I can't honestly say I've ever been loved for it.\n\nIts even showing physically. It feels like my body is giving up. Facial warts, Cellulitis, Cysts all in the last year and all brought about by stress. Half functioning Kidneys and Liver too. Not from drugs or drink or an accident. Just pure stress at 20 years of age. I've had my last rights due to that damage and even that is a tainted memory. Woke up out of an induced coma to come home and hear stories about how it was an attempted suicide. I just couldn't take the rejection of someone I knew for years.

If so, what do I tell the operator? \"Somebody I don't like is at my door\"?\n* NParents file a 'missing person' report on me, because me not responding to them means I must be lost or dead (yes, they would do this)\n* They find out where I work, or somewhere I go to frequently, and force contact/ambush me there\n* They contact local police stations, organizations, etc asking about me and trying to get my name out there, or maybe even saying I'm mentally unwell, to do a \"wellness check\" on me\n* Trying to sue me\n\nMy NParents are completely unaware of any abuse ever having occurred, and they think that, despite me limiting communication with them, I'm going to rejoin them in a few years and we're all going to be a good ol' happy family again.

        "text": "A bit of background:\n\nI grew up in a religious household. My father was/is a baptist preacher of the fundamentalist variety and all my extended family (save one uncle) are also zealous Christians. I was disciplined in the typical way: spankings with a belt, spankings with a wooden spoon, spankings with a switch (I had to go outside and pick a branch off a bush that I would be then spanked with), and spanked with a fairly large paddle that had been painted bright red with the words \"Red Dragon\" painted across it in black ink. On one occasion, when I was very little, I had been caught running about the house without my clothes on, little kids are known to do. My father took me into the bedroom and took out a knife and told me that if he caught me with my 'pee pee' out again, he might have to cut it off. Soooo yeah. That's what discipline was like in my house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy older brother always had behavioral issues (shocking, I know) and was generally considered the black sheep of the family. I observed his behavior and the consequences he met with, and I decided I was going to avoid those types of run-ins at all costs. I immersed myself in music and literature and generally tried to stay out of trouble. I always had a strained relationship with my brother. In retrospect, he exhibited many traits of borderline personality disorder. He was definitely narcissistic. I always felt like a cloud followed him around and I felt like I had to tip-toe around him in order to avoid his outbursts, which were sudden and violent.\n\nOne of the tipping points for me to begin alienation came when I was in college. It was a strict Christian college and the student body was treated almost as if we were children. We had curfews and \"lights out\" and we would earn demerits for trivial things. One of the rules was zero tolerance for drinking alcohol. I had no problem with this because drinking never appealed to me. One summer, my brother and I went golfing and then we went over to his house afterwards. He handed me a cider to drink and I looked at the bottle and ascertained that there was alcohol in it. He just laughed and said I'd have to drink a ton of these to get drunk and that one bottle wouldn't do a thing to me (which is true). So I drank about half a bottle and then left for home. Months went by and then I started school again. One night my brother came by the parent's for a visit and I was there as well. I don't remember exactly how he flew into a rage, but it was over something trivial. Suddenly he began trying to fist fight my father and then when I tried to get involved he cursed at me and said my life would be a failure etc. and that he would get me back (for what? I still don't know).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple days later, I got a call from the Dean of Students at my college asking to meet me. I had no idea what it was about. He then told me he had been notified that I had been drinking alcohol and that I could be expelled for such behavior. The cider from months ago didn't even register with me and so I was arguing that there must be some mistake. Then he said my brother had called the president of the school and said I had been drinking that summer and I should be expelled. Of course, I panicked and tried to explain what had occurred. Besides, it was during the summer and I was not under their jurisdiction when I'm not in school. I was basically reduced to a puddle of tears as I pleaded with them not to punish me. Then they said my brother had called again a few days later and tried to take it back and said for them to ignore his first call. Of course, my brother never told me what he had done. I wasn't kicked out of school. But I resolved never to see my brother again. And I didn't see him for months, until I was told he was coming over for Thanksgiving. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my family that under no circumstances should he be allowed to show up for Thanksgiving and pretend nothing had happened. But my mother begged me to just ignore it and move on . . . basically keep the peace. I refused. And when he came over, I had already left. It was the first time I had stood up for myself. I spent Thanksgiving sitting in my car at a gas station eating Combos and listening to the radio. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths went by and finally my brother decided to apologize. I accepted his apology, but I knew that he had done something so horrible that a simple sorry wouldn't fix it. I knew he would just blow up at me again. It was just a matter of time. That eventually happened when he and his family came up to visit me and my wife at our summer cottage in Massachusetts. I had recently bought a few books from an old bookstore and was eager to leaf through them for a couple hours. So while my brother and his wife went out to the beach, I went up to my room and browsed the books. Of course, he took this as me trying to \"avoid him\" and he got pissed, but kept it to himself. The next morning he said they were going to drive to Maine (about an hour-and-a-half away) and visit a few outlet shops etc. I had already done that trip several times over the years, so I said that, and I was going to take a rain check and do some general chores around the house which needed to be done (mowing, weeding, etc.). Our cottage is in my wife's family trust and general up-keep is part of the requirements for using the cottage. \n\nWell, he flew into a rage and started accusing me of trying to avoid him. I was bewildered and asked him to sit down and try and talk more civilly about things, so I could understand what he mean't, but he wouldn't have it. He started cursing at me outside and a several  the neighbors noticed and had gone outside to see what was happening (which is a BAD look). It was incredibly embarrassing. \n\nOf course, a few hours went by and then he texts  asking if we want to meet for dinner. No mention of the huge scene earlier that day. No acknowledgment that it had ever happened. So we spent one awkward dinner together and he and his wife left the next morning. As I waived bye to him and told my wife that was the last time I would ever see him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are just two examples of what life was like living with him and associating with him. There are tons more stories I could share, but I've already rambled on enough. So, is my choice to sever that relationship justifiable? I knew that he would never change. There would always be these kinds of scenes and one day I realized I no loved him, nor did I car if he lived or died. The accumulation of years of these kinds of experiences had rendered me dumb and indifferent to his existence. ",

I leaned over and said to my friend \"That's \\[Brother\\] right there.\" and he simply raised his eyebrows (he's super coy...we've been at this awhile) and asked \"Should we say hi?\" He has known my brother since the boy was four years old. He knows him well, too. \n\nAnd then, I made a snap decision, because I had been wondering that too. Should I say hi? Should I go over there and \"be the bigger person\" and initiate contact? Tell him I *see him*? I decided **No.** So, I said loudly, \"No, he saw me. He can say hi if he wants to. He knows where to find me.\" \n\nI've always told my youngest siblings where to find me (the oldest of the younger brothers is 100% a Golden Child basking in the glow) and that my doors are open to people who are *willing to accept that I am not a liar.* But, see, if I'm not a liar, that means that my mother is actually a horrible person who has emotionally and verbally abused me, and that everything *she* has said since I left is a lie. And that is a lot to accept. Thus, I will wait. They're all under 25 and they've got a loooooong life ahead of them if they want to keep dealing with that Toxic Waste Mess.",

Every time I get upset he holds our relationship at gunpoint. If I ask to be left alone, he continues to interrupt me. When he is mad he will blow up my phone, and he doesnt like to talk on the phone. ",
