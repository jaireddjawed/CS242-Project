I had three assignments this week and 8 discussion boards for my class. I currently am also taking 2 other courses and working full time. I don’t understand the material. I handed in one of my assignments which was fine. Assignment 2 I only did half of because I didn’t understand. And the 3 one I didn’t even submit because it’s not close to being where I want it to be. And now I’m going to get 10 points taken off when it’s only worth 30. My class is completely online and he doesn’t post on how to do anything. Just assigns the material. I’m struggling and when I asked for help, he made it seem like I was an idiot for asking. I don’t have a background in accounting. I don’t know what to do. I’m crying so hard right now, I only have 4 more classes to go before I can graduate. What are my options? Please no mean comments. My school doesn’t offer any tutoring since I’m a graduate student. It’s to late to withdraw. I’m really struggling and just want to make it through the night",

For my 2 upcoming semesters, I get to choose some electives teaching Python. I took 1 Python class in college but it was all about using the turtle library to draw simple graphics so not very helpful for analytics. Before grad school, I had 0 experience applying programming to analytics so I don't know much about how Python is used differently compared with R for marketing positions. For now, I have not chosen any of those Python classes but I am considering whether to change my electives. I am wondering if knowing R is enough to get me a marketing analyst job or if I need to be familiar with both R and Python.",

        "text": "Hello there! I am unable to make a huge decision for myself so I must resort to reddit strangers.\n\nTLDR; Should I quit my master's program when I already finished all the classes and only have thesis left? There are so many different things I would rather be doing with my time but quitting feels embarrassing, especially after going through so much.\n\nRight after finishing my bachelor's for software engineering, I got into full time job and a data science master's program. I tried pulling off both while also doing TAship and had to eventually quit my job to finish classes. In the end, I got to the thesis stage. But I couldn't sit around for another year so I got a great job that I really like in Germany. \n\nThis semester was supposed to be my thesis semester however I absolutely hate the topic which pretty much feels like free labor. \"Create a system for this private company for free and your thesis will write itself!\"\n\nI also don't connect with my advisor and he doesn't give a shit about me. I stopped reaching out 2 months ago and he hasn't reached out once. \n\nI really want to drop out because I am so tired of trying to make this work and making sacrifices for it even though I don't even like or believe in what I do anymore. But I feel ashamed of the idea of dropping out because it's a prestigious school and in the end, I would come out like a failure. \n\nI also am afraid of how it would reflect on my CV. Or how not having a master's degree would keep me from going up in my career. \n\nAny experience or advice anyone has, I am all ears.",

        "text": "Hi. Just trying to work through the idea of going to grad school. \n\nSome background. I am 28 and have spent 7 years in the restaurant industry. I graduated from a prestigious undergrad university but have always struggled with direction and have rebelled against traditional career path and “steps” of adulthood. (I’m also an artist so I sort of had that starving artist mentality). I had a bit of a crisis this summer where I felt completely done with restaurants and like I have so much more to offer. And I am at the age now where the future doesn’t seem like an intangible thing and I know I don’t want to be serving tables forever. So, I went on a job search and tried for a more stable job with salary and PTO and all that jazz in the event execution space. It’s not for me. So I feel put back to the drawing board of what to do and what path to take. Try for another job change? Or go to school to lead to an ideal career change?\n\nI have always had the thought that if I didn’t do music full time, I would love to be a therapist. I am passionate about mindfulness and psychology and have been personally committed to managing my decade long struggles with mental health. I have spent a good amount of time directing my own studies in the subject. So from time to time I wonder if I  should go to grad school to become a therapist. Deep in my heart I KNOW I would love the study, I would love the career, and I would feel super fulfilled helping people navigate their own mental health journeys. But every time I consider it, I look up a few programs and immediately freak out about the tuition and the amount of debt I would have to take on. I would love some advice from anyone who has gone to grad school. Do you feel like the cost is worth it for a fulfilling change in life direction? Were there online options that were more affordable? Did you have to take time to justify the cost to yourself and how did you do so? Does anyone completely regret it? Any advice from real life experience would be very appreciated.",

Since my Master's degree is in history, but I have experience conducting polsci research (I have two conference papers under my belt, and revising a policy paper that is planned for publication), I'm trying to obtain references that can speak to my polsci research capability, and ability to seamlessly transition into this field.\n\nThe program I'm applying to requires four applications. Here is who I have so far:\n\n1. My Master's thesis supervisor. While she cannot comment on my work in polsci, she is able to discuss that I am researching topics beyond history.\n2. My Insurgency professor, who, while a historian, can comment on my polsci capabilities.\n3. My TA supervisor, who I have a good relationship with.\n\nAs I am looking for a fourth reference, I am deciding between two options:\n\n\\- My African history professor. For his class, my research paper focused on genocide studies and the limits of peacekeeping, albeit from a historical lens.\n\n\\- My boss, who is a political scientist - I'm working as a Research Assistant, but not directly below him -but who has only really known me for almost month.\n\nSo, based on what I've included here. Which professor do you believe would be the better option? While I believe a letter from a political scientist would be helpful, I am concerned that it would not be as substantive as I would like, considering the short time he's known me. I welcome everybody to give their thoughts! Thanks in advance for your appreciated help.",

Now there are 3 levels to CA, I'm currently in the first level and the college course which is Bcom hons my bachelor's degree corresponds with the second level(which is the most difficult out of all three as only 1.29% of people pass). Not the whole of it but 25% of it.\n\nSo now I'm thinking that I might fail a sem and would have to restart college by going to a different one, or if i pass somehow i will transfer to a different college as managing ca with the college I'm currently enrolled at is very difficult.\n\nNow i want to ask that here we have two scenarios,\n1. I fail college, and with a new year start a new degree at a different college and pursue CA side by Side\n\n2. I somehow pass, and because i want to complete the professional course i transfer to an easier college.\n \n\n\nNow i really want to go to the us to do a MSc finance/mba program or maybe a MsBa.

It’s not a requirement for me to take a year of physics to graduate, and as of right now, I’m in Physics 1 and struggling HARD. I do not think I would do well in Physics 2, to the point that I do not know if I would graduate on time. Most grad school programs I have looked at have one year  of physics as a pre-req and I am not sure what to do! Any advice would be appreciated.",

I was just wondering if it is feasible to apply to a math grad school with the intent of applying math to the social sciences or if I should just stick to just computational math. I want to get an applied/computational math grad degree not a psych one since the funding is different for the two domains and I feel like the math one would give me more options. For reference, I'm asking this for a personal statement, I'm not sure if I should include psychology in it because although that's what I want to apply the math to, I'm not sure if it would impact admission to certain schools.

I asked to defer until fall 2023, so I would be able to keep that as an option, but they’ve requested I pay a $2,000 deposit to keep my place. I thought of using this as my “back up”.

        "text": "I am applying (pretty last minute) to a HESA program at the university I work at. As full time staff I would be elegible for a tuition waiver of admitted, so my degree would be free. They just started admitting students for a new part time program that’s targeting towards people who are currently working in higher Ed. I have my bachelor’s but it’s in speech pathology, and it took me 8 years to get (I started as fine arts, switched to psych, then ended up in speech). I went to college at 18 and had no idea what I wanted to do, and I also worked full time as a server, as well as moved to 3 different states, so it took me a really long time to graduate.\n\nI also took part in no extra activities during college- despite going to two pretty large universities, I was always a commuter and wasn’t involved in anything other than going to class. Now that I’m re-doing my resume to submit with my application, I’m torn whether I should list my restaurant experience or not. I only have 3 “related” jobs to list (2 non profit jobs and the admin role I’m currently in). Everything else has been serving or bartending for the last 15 years. \n\nMy thoughts on including it are to show that I was working full time through college, and that I’ve always had at least 2-3 jobs at once, in hopes of high lighting my work ethic. Currently I have written lots of detail for my 3 related jobs, then I have another section labeled “other work experience” where I just list the restaurants  and dates. Without that section my resume looks pretty bleak. Does it make sense to include it?",

How detrimental will this be for grad school (in particular, Master's programs)?\n\nI've heard doing not as well in one course isn't a problem, but I just can just say I got rather unlucky with the one course I didn't do well on.\n\nI can take another real analysis class next year, and doing well in that may compensate (but I would of course need to do well). However, that course is in term 2 next, meaning that grad schools won't see my grade in that course should I improve my grade.\n\nI'm a Canadian in a top 3 uni (in Canada) and want to apply to grad schools in Canada and possibly in other countries, if that gives any relevant information.",

Although I do have research experience, my UG coursework has been pretty laughable. I got through DiffEq with a poor idea of what a Laplace transform is, and I was able to get good grades without learning very much. I realize now this was to my own detriment, but now that I'm looking at graduate school, I'm worried that I might be very behind other students. \n\nDoes anyone relate to this experience or have related anecdotes?",

There's also rudeness like when one of my classmates answered the lecturer's question, this group of 4 clapped in an obviously mocking way. Then they answered the question while shotting down his answer. I am apalled by the immaturity that still exists.\n\nWe also had a submission wherein the lecturer only gave the term but not what it is, so we had to research it ourselves. It was an easy find. But there were classmates who were asking for the template for it. It's a simple Google search!\n\nThen there are also group works and I am so frustrated with the passiveness and lack of participation of some members.

When I first started college I became super depressed and didn't know what I wanted to do with my future. It also didn't help that all courses were online due to COVID my freshmen/some of my sophmore year. I didn't try very hard in my classes and came out with a couple Cs and Bs. I only realized what I wanted to do after my sophmore year. \n\nI really would love to get a PhD in pharmacology or organic chemistry but I feel like I don't have enough to show for it. I enjoy working in the lab and I think I'm a decent writer.  I haven't done much in the way of actual research yet but I will be starting actual research with a professor next semester. I really want to do a summer internship but I think I have a next to zero percent chance of getting one. I  have little to no lab experience as of right now besides doing lab assignments in class. I also have no way to pay for housing (my parents live in the middle of nowhere so unfortunately living with them is not an option). \n\nI don't recall getting a single A in a science course and my GPA average is \\~3.4. I read about graduate admissions, and I see that if you are getting Bs in science courses, you can forget about it. I even talked to the professor I'm going to be working with and he said 3. 4 is pretty low end. Does that mean I should re-take all of those courses or try to get as much research experience as I can? Would I essentially have to do freshmen and sophmore year over again for a decent shot? \n\nSorry If I come off as rambly or stupid but I feel trapped and I don't really have anyone who understands.",

I graduated nearly two years ago but stayed an extra year to work and hangout with friends, as I was unsure what I wanted to do. I now live in my hometown which is two hours from my college town and as you'd expect, I am very attached to my university and the town it resides in. I really want to go back as I love the learning environment and feel very comfortable in the town. Comfortability is super important to me. I'll be living in my hometown for at least another year, so I'd be returning as a 25 or 26 year old. The program would save me money and is flexible but I also know some people might advise against this decision for various reasons. I'd love any advice because I've changed my mind so many times when it comes to figuring out what I want out of life, lol.",
