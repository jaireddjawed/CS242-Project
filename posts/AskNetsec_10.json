My problem with that is, even though I am giving 6-8GB of RAM (out of 16GB), it is still kind of buggy and slow.\n\nThis led me to try and doing penetration testing practice from the host (OSX) itself, thinking that I'll install whatever tool I'll need. But man oh man, there are so many tools which I would have to go over if I try and do everything manually.\n\nAnother option that I am considering is that I have a Seagate Barracuda SATA drive, so I buy the necessary connectors for that and try installing Kali there and have a dual boot option. But, I really do not want to do this, as I'm worried that I'll mess up the partition somehow.\n\nI have given up googling because they go over boilerplate installing material, whereas I need someone who is using a setup currently with VulnHub or HackThebox.eu\n\nSo help me in setting up an environment, please.",

For a whole two months the internet was losing its mind over it, then it seemed to have dropped off the map. \n\nHas there been any significant news since the announcement of the second set of routers affected?\n\nAnd, most interesting to me, has the stage 1 initial infection vector been uncovered? I get what happened after stage 1 activated(deriving an IP from EXIF in a photobucket post, which fetched stage 2 and 3), but how did stage 1 get into and execute in the first place? AFAIK, it was using known public vulnerabilities in various routers, but was each model targeted with a separate attack, multiple attacks, or was there a over arching common weakness in the affected routers?\n\nThe most ive heard is that it was a worm of some sort that affected routers which supported 'NAS on router'(routers with USB ports that could host an attached drive as a network storage space). If thats the case, were affected routers actively sharing, either internally or externally, a NAS drive on the router? Was just stock firmware affected or could it affect third party FW like DDWRT, OpenWRT, tomato, etc? Does it only affect edge routers, or would internal routers be susceptible(in the case of having, say, an ISPs internet facing router connected to another router hosting a different internal subnet(yes i know, double NAT bad))?  \n\nThe lack of in depth knowledge of something so potentially damaging is disconcerting to say the least. Id at least like to get an idea of how stage 1 got execute permissions on so many routers, but all google turns up is article after article on stage 1 -&gt; stage 2,3 mechanisms and 'reboot now!'",

A \"open\" network that uses a captive portal with a TLS1.2 login page\n\nThe Networking team is in favor of #2, because otherwise someone could stand up a rogue AP and collect NTLM hashes, which are trivial to break, and then they'll have everyone's passwords.\n\nI'm in favor of #1, because even though #1 is vulnerable to NTLM password collection, someone could just stand up a rogue AP with a fake captive portal and collect credentials anyway. And at least with #1, you'd get some layer-1 encryption keeping the connection confidential (yes people should be using TLS, but of course not all sites use TLS, and SNI breaks your privacy anyway). In fact, your layer-1 encryption will also be preventing MTIM and other active attacks too.\n\nDoes this sound correct? Is any of my statements-of-fact or logic wrong here? What would you do? Let's assume for a moment that we cannot use certificates, that MSCHAP2 is the best WPA2Enterprise algo we can use, and that we're on a busy city street where WiFi sniffing is super easy (which is true).\n\nThanks for your thoughts.",

Pretty certain it's her but facing denials so looking to actually get some proof so it can be shown beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nNetwork is mainly Apple hardware so devices include Apple iMac, Apple Airport and iOS devices. On the iMac there are parental controls so time spent is limited per day. No parental controls on iOS devices but their Wi-Fi access is time managed.\n\nI do have a PC but it is hardly used and is off most of the time and don't really want to run this 24/7 for network monitoring.\n\nI have a Synology Disk Station DS213+ and recall running something to help monitor my router way back when I was having issues with connectivity. Not sure this is relevant today as it was monitoring logs from an old router when I had a dodgy ADSL connection. Now working with a NetComm NF10WV router with NBN (Australia).\n\nIronically the Synology has been off a lot this month to try and put a stop to the watching of shows that are store on it. This has had the negative effect of stuff just being streamed off the internet.\n\nLooking for a solution that is free as I have zero budget for new software and can't really do with a solution that requires the PC to be on.",

        "text": "[r/asknetsec](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec),  I was recently contacted by a local high school student for an assignment for his business class.  They were to learn about various careers and provide a report.  Below are my responses to his questions.\n\nI'm posting looking for corrections or criticisms.  Specifically, I'm interested if anything I said does/doesn't apply to RE, Threat Intel, SOC Analyst, Auditor, or other fields I'm less familiar with.\n\nMy real target audience is me, a decade ago, in high school with a vague idea that I think I would be a good engineer.  I don't think I wasted time between then and now, but there was a LOT of luck involved, and a clear vision of the possible could have mitigated that.  I know a couple kids growing up who might have chosen infosec if they had known more about it then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n////////// My Response ///////////\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne reason I am agreeing to do this is that I really enjoy the work I do.  I left \\[Rural Midwest\\] 10 years ago and didn't even know these kinds of jobs existed.  Now I've returned doing a job I love and living within 15 minutes of the home I grew up in.  I don't think information on my career field has improved for high school students since I left, so I like to try to provide that exposure when opportunities like this present themselves.\n\n**1. Tell me about what exactly you do and what a typical day consists of.**\n\nPosition / Title / Profession:  I'm a Cyber Threat Hunter.  I'm technically hired as an Information Security Consultant for a very large company, but my team calls us Hunters. I think of myself as an Information Security Engineer (able to move back and forth between \"Hunter\", \"Red Teamer\", \"Penetration Tester\", \"Physical Tester\", and a little \"Security Architect\" as the need arises).\n\nMy team strives to help our clients improve their information security posture, as well as determine if the client has been or is currently hacked.  We work for Department of Defense, Federal Agencies, some State Governments and private companies.  We'll help them by providing:\n\n1. Hunt assessments:  Where we'll go to the customer site and deploy a pretty broad range of tools, conduct client and potential threat analysis, and search for anomalies in order to identify if the client has experienced a breach, or threat intrusion.  If we identify an intrusion, we'll hand the investigation over to an Incident Response team and provide assistance to them as needed.  This is typically done over a 4 - 6-week period but some really big clients have us working on 6 month or longer engagements.  Usually we go to the customer (DC, San Antonio, Atlanta, New York, Denver, Columbus, etc.) but we can sometimes do the work remotely.\n2. Training offerings:  Most of our clients have their own internal teams.  They hire us for surge support, to cover a technical gap their team doesn't have the skills for, or to coach their team to perform better.  In the course of those jobs we've developed week long training courses that we provide fairly regularly.\n3. Red Team and Physical Penetration Testing:  My previous job did this exclusively, but I don't do it as much anymore.  In information security (sometimes called \"Cyber\" when in a Government context) Red Team is a group used to simulate a bad guy.  They attempt to break into the network, perform reconnaissance, steal sensitive information, and sometimes manipulate systems/data.  Physical Penetration Testing is similar, but it happens in the physical world.  Physical testers, try to break or sneak into sensitive buildings, install remote access tools, or steal data or merchandise. You can probably imagine the tools a Physical Tester might use (lock picks, duct tape, cameras with long lenses, pen-cams, badge printers, electronic badge readers, etc.).  Red Teamers use an analogous mix of \"hacking\" tools (RATs \\[Remote Access Trojans\\], Password crackers, email and web servers, numerous reconnaissance tools, whatever native tools are on the target system, and a number of specialty tools or exploits depending on the situation).  Both of these engagements are used to help clients identify their own weaknesses and vulnerabilities so they can then patch them, as well as provide a thinking adversary for the clients' defenders (SOC \\[Security Operations Center\\], Hunters, Incident Response Team, Guards, etc.) to practice against.\n\nAs you can see there is a fairly broad range of activities that I might be asked to do.  Currently, I'm probably only actively on an engagement with a client half to a third of the time.  The majority of my time is spent studying, experimenting, refining our classes, or preparing to go on an engagement.  For engagement prep, I usually have a pretty good idea what skills I'm going to need in the planning stages (about a month out).  I can practice anything I need to in that period.  Also, I tend to help any of my teammates with the skills they need for their engagements and vice versa.  There's such a broad and deep range of skills required that most (all) of us can't stay up-to-date on everything all the time, so we specialize and become the go-to guy/gal on some specific skillset.  Speaking of up-to-date:  this field is constantly changing.  Every day there are new attacker and defender techniques and tools published each of those affects how we perform all of the above engagement types.  So, staying abreast of the current state of InfoSec takes quite a bit of time as well.  Secondly, we're constantly polishing and maintaining the courses we offer.  So, I spend plenty of time improving exercises, setting up demos, or incorporating new techniques/tools.\n\n**2. Is this a typical job and was it hard to find? How did you go about getting the job?**\n\nI'd say no, my exact position is not very common.  However, the field of Information Security or Cyber Security is very broad and growing.  There are numerous technical skill levels, and plenty of opportunities to off-ramp from the more technical tracks to management, auditing, consulting, or in-house teams (all of which have different compensation, lifestyles, challenges and opportunities).\n\nIt's hard for me to judge how hard it was to find my position.  I didn't know \"Hunters\" existed in the information security sense when I left the military 3 years ago.  I knew \"Penetration Testers\" (kind of like a Red Teamer) existed and I was pursuing a certification in that specialty.  That's when I got a call from one of my wife's friends who was managing a team in Northern Virginia.  The team had a series of challenges I had to pass that tested my coding ability, persistence, and to some extent mindset.  Then I interviewed and got the job.  The pay was OK to live in such an expensive area, but the position was a great foot in the door to the community.  That's where I really gained most of my technical skills, progressed as a Physical Penetration Tester, and learned about Hunters.  That team split up for unrelated reasons.  I then leveraged a personal contact with my then boss to get this position where I've been honing my defensive skills.\n\n**3. What are your work hours and how does experience affect your position in the job?**\n\nAfter about a year in this position working about 50% at home (in Northern Virginia) and 50% at the office I asked to go full remote and relocate back to \\[rural Midwest\\].  I had a great relationship with my boss and other managers and had a couple major projects successfully under my belt.  Ultimately, they agreed, and I was able to move my family back home while keeping that job.\n\nHours for my specific position are very flexible.  When not traveling, I work from an office at home.  I have to get in about 40 hours a week, but they can be whenever I want (for the most part).  Mostly, I do 5x 8hour days a week 8 - 5 with lunch, but if I want to take off a day I'll do 4x 10hour days a week.  When I do my time can revolve around when the people I need to talk to are doing theirs.  I work with teammates from Los Angeles to DC, so keeping track of their time zones, when they're on lunch and what their most productive hours are has been an unexpected interesting twist.\n\nI knew when I left the military that remote work was possible in the career track I was aiming at (penetration tester at that time).  However, I also knew no one was going to take a brand new to the field guy and let him work remote.  Also, I needed a lot of in-person mentorship at that point, so I didn't even look at opening that were remote.  I set out to build my resume in this field with the ultimate goal of moving back to \\[rural Midwest\\] with a remote position.  Since that time, I worked under some really smart guys (and gals), ran my own projects and generally became a known quantity to my team.  At that point I was able to successfully pull the trigger on a move to full-remote.\n\nASIDE:  I just realized I've been talking about remote work a lot and haven't explained why that's such a big issue for me.  I have a wife and child.  All of the grandparents and great grandparents live in \\[rural Midwest\\].  This area is just home for my wife and I so that's where we want our family.  As you can see, living and working in this area is, and has been, a major goal for us since we left 10 years ago.  For the most part Red Teamers and Hunters will work for the military teams, consulting firms, or in-house teams for government or private companies.  Military teams are all located at large hubs for the services (Maryland, Denver, San Antonio, Augusta) all places I don't really want to live anymore.  Government teams are usually co-located with the government offices they support (a lot around DC, so that leaves state government and I'd rather live in DC than \\[Midwest state capital\\]).  In-house teams for private companies are usually located near either the company hubs or near the big military/government areas (so they can pull from the talent pool of people leaving those jobs).  So that leaves the consultancies which are also usually around the military or government InfoSec hubs or in up-and-coming \"hip tech hubs\" like Seattle, Southern California, Austin, Charlotte, or Raleigh with a couple notables in weird places, but they have a lot more leeway with remote work and usually cite it as a perk over government jobs.  So at least for the time I'm tied to being a consultant because it allows me to work in \\[rural Midwest\\].  Also, I really enjoy seeing a new environment with each new engagement, learning what they’re doing well and not-so-well, and applying those lessons to other clients.\n\n**4. Does your military background help you out in your job?** **Did it give you a one up on others looking for your job?**\n\nMy military background definitely played a major role in helping me get on the track I'm on.  (Note: there are people on my team doing the exact job I'm doing with no military experience, but they have other skills that fill gaps in my and other team member knowledge).\n\nMany of our government and military clients will require security clearances to work on their networks.  Having my clearance from the military easily put me ahead of anyone with similar skills that didn't have one.\n\nI was a Signals Intelligence Officer.  As such I received quite a bit of training on various technologies with a lot of overlap with my current position.  Also, the military planning structure works in a way that the Intelligence Officer usually has to play the adversary when we \"Wargame\" our operations.  This helps us develop an \"adversarial mindset\" that is useful in all aspects of my current job.  Also, I spent a tour with a special operations team that gave me Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape (SERE) training that is especially useful for physical testing.  That tour also improved some of my computer/coding skills and helped hone my adversarial mindset.\n\n**5. What is the most challenging part of your job?**\n\nIt's really difficult to stay up-to-date on all the latest techniques, tools and tradecraft.  I'm probably a professional learner more than anything else.  If my skills were to stagnate I'd be pretty useless in this profession before long because it moves so fast.\n\n**6. What is the education background that you needed to land such an interesting and exciting job?**\n\nMy career path has been meandering with peers getting on and off the track I followed each step of the way.  I'll say that I received a BS in Engineering from \\[Midwest College\\].  A 4-year degree is required to be a military officer.  Having a STEM degree helped me with my assignment to Signals Intelligence but is not a hard requirement.  After the military I think my positions came as a result more of my military experience.  About a third of the people I know doing this don't have a degree but gained a lot of military experience from the enlisted side.  I know one guy who was military but didn't get any computer experience there and no degree, who was all self-taught. He is a rockstar, but definitely took the hard road.\n\nThe people that I think had the most straightforward path to this job went to the Air Force Academy for Computer Science degrees and became Cyberspace Operations Officers.  But I know History majors, Sailors, Coast Guardsmen, Soldiers, Airmen, Marines, and Civilians all doing this job.\n\nAlso, professional certifications... Some are really good, and some aren't worth the time let alone the money to take them.  The community tends to value certifications that require practical application assessments over multiple choice certifications.  Occasionally, I’ll need a specific certification to improve my knowledge in some aspect or meet some client requirement.\n\nAnother military benefit is the GI bill.  A couple guys I know have gotten a free bachelor’s degree after the military, and I'm planning to get a masters on my GI bill.\n\n**7. Who relies on you doing your job correctly?**\n\nUltimately my job is about informing organizations about their information security risks, helping them appropriately allocate resources to improve their security posture.  Success looks like either my team or the client finding the bad guys quickly to reduce damage.  In the case of a private company that damage could mean loss of intellectual property, business plans, strategies, and customer data.  Those can have enormous costs to the business like lawsuits (Target paid about $20 million to settle a lawsuit over stolen customer data last year) and government fines.  Better securing our Government clients is better securing the personal information of all Americans (OPM hacks of 2014 and 2015), the plans and capabilities of our military, and the continued operations of critical services.\n\n**8. What are some benefits that your job offers and is it worth it?**\n\n* It's really fun:  I like the competition aspect.  I like catching the bad guy, I like sneaking past the good guys (like capture the flag), I like winning.\n* I get to live where I want:  It's been a goal of mine for a long time.\n* I still get to travel but not too frequently that it's a problem.\n* I like the subjects, I like reading about security, testing and experimenting and would probably do it still if I wasn't getting paid.\n* Continuing education benefits:  My company recognizes the value of providing training, so each Hunter gets an annual allowance for time and money to take certifications or other professional training.\n\nAll the above make it pretty worth it for me.\n\n**9. What is the worst thing about your job?**\n\nFor the specialized consulting service that we provide our team needs to be more \"InfoSec famous\".  We have to go and speak at conferences, write articles, and publicly release code.  That requires putting ourselves out there (collectively and individually).  Most of my team comes from a world of secrecy where we don't tell people what we do or who we do it for.  I did that for 7 years and am still not very comfortable \"going public\".  Aside from that I don't like public speaking anyway.  I can kind of get away with it during the classes I teach because I really like the topic and student interactions, but it's still probably the worst part of my job.\n\n**10. Finally do you like your job? Do you recommend it, and who do you recommend it to?**\n\nYeah, I like my job.  And I like the field of Information Security.  I'd recommend the field to anyone with:\n\n* a passion for breaking stuff, figuring out how it works, and putting it back together (sometimes differently).\n* a passion for security and improving systems and processes\n* an aptitude with computers\n\nAdditionally, there is a shortfall of skilled InfoSec Professionals, and the field is growing.",

        "text": "We are creating a web service that will ultimately have tokens to monitor bank transactions, and make payments on behalf of our customer.   Because the signup process for our service is so intensive, and requires so many steps, the team is trying to save the user some sign-up pains.\n\n**Currently the team is recommending:** that when the user signs up and gives a Username (email address) and password, that we do not require authentication of that email account before moving forward.\n\n**My concerns are:** \n\n*  If the user mis types their email address during signup, and does not authenticate, they may end up not being able to sign back in, or even find their account.\n\n*  If we start billing via their bank or payment system, and they can no longer login, or reset their account, it will be a very bad experience for the customers.\n\nI'd like to get a gauge of what people think here.   Is this sustainable for a short period of time.   Given a choice here, is this a 50/50 choice, a 60/40 choice, or a really, really bad idea?\n\nIf you have had any personal experiences with something like this, I'd love to hear those thoughts as well.  Don't go easy on me.  :)\n",

I say stealing a cert and signing the miner with it or any backdoor for that matter then distribute it would have a far more devastating effect.\n\nEdit: It turned out that you have to put your hands on the proper code signing certificate; those found in web servers are only trusted by browsers not by the operating system.
