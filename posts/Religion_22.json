        "text": "I ask this sensitive question because some people cite news about priests or pastors abusing children, but rarely quote statistics on the issue to prove that religion has something to do with it. Of course, sexual abuse can be found in institutions in all religions besides the typical cases in Christianity and Judaism, but often news focus on those religions.\n\nIt is understandable that people have a higher moral expectancy from religious people, which is understandable, but I wonder if the emphasis on the abuse of children by religious leaders is justified statistically speaking.\n\nI think that at this point even atheists agree that most religious schools are usually OK and even better than secular schools. I joke that it is almost a requirement for atheist parents to send their children to religious schools, because it is so common in Western Europe and usually atheists have greater income to choose private schools.\n\nI think this is important because parents need an objective way to know if a school is safer, and some religious schools have been remarkable and are very respected. For example, a religious school that had an abuse case in 10 years and handled the issue swiftly may be safer than a public school that had multiple abuse cases in the same period, but as people expect higher moral standard form religious schools, they probably will choose the public school even if it is not safer statistically speaking, because the moral expectancy, paradoxically exposing their own children to greater danger.\n\n**In essence**: Is Sexual abuse by religious leaders in schools statistically more significant than abuse elsewhere? Is religion even a significant variable here?",

        "text": "**Quranic createdness** refers to the doctrinal position that the Quran was created, rather than having always existed and thus being \"uncreated\". In the Muslim world the opposite point of view — that the Quran is uncreated — is the accepted stance among the **majority Muslims** (Nowadays). Shia Muslims on the other hand argue for the createdness of the Quran. \n\nThe dispute over which was true became a significant point of contention in early Islam. The Islamic rationalist philosophical school known as the **Mutazila** held that if the Quran is God's word, logically God \"must have preceded his own speech\".[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quranic_createdness#cite_note-SKHE-77-1) The Quran is believed to express God's eternal will, but the work itself must have been created by Him at some point in time. \n\nWould that mean Allah has been cursing Abu Lahab for all eternity. Before he was ever born. Before the world ever came into existance. His wife too. Destined to suffer in hell in all eternity. Before ever being born. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and he ˹himself˺ perish!  Neither his wealth nor ˹worldly˺ gains will benefit him.  He will burn in a flaming Fire,  and ˹so will˺ his wife, the carrier of ˹thorny˺ kindling, around her neck will be a rope of palm-fibre.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;111:1-5\n\nThe controversy over the doctrine in the Abbasid caliphate came to a head during the reign of Caliph **Abd Allah al-Ma’mun**. In 827 CE, al-Ma’mun publicly adopted the doctrine of createdness, and six years later instituting an inquisition known as the mihna (test or ordeal) to \"ensure acquiescence in this doctrine\". The mihna continued during the reigns of Caliph Al-Mutasim and Caliph Al-Wathiq, and during the early reign of Caliph Al-Mutawakkil. Those who did not accept that the Qur’an is **created were punished, imprisoned, or even killed**.\n\nAccording to Sunni tradition, when \"tested\", traditionist **Ahmad ibn Hanbal** refused to accept the doctrine of createdness despite two years imprisonment and being scourged until unconscious. Eventually, due to Ahmad ibn Hanbal's determination, Caliph Al-Mutawakkil ʿAlā ’llāh, released him and the Mu'tazila doctrine was silenced for a time. In the years thereafter in the Abbasid state, it was the minority of Muslims who believed in Quranic createdness who were on the **receiving end of the sword or lash**.\n\n \n\nThe influential scholar Al-Tabari (d.923) declared in his *aqidah* (creed) that (in the words of Islamic historian Michael Cook) the Quran is\n\n&gt;God's uncreated word however it is written or recited, whether it be in heaven or on earth, whether written on the 'guarded tablet' or on the tablets of schoolboys, whether inscribed on stone or on paper, whether memorized in the heart or spoken on the tongue; **whoever says otherwise is an infidel whose blood may be shed and from whom God has dissociated Himself**.\n\n12th century Almoravid jurist Qadi Ayyad, citing the work of Malik ibn Anas, wrote that:\n\n&gt;He said about someone who said that the Quran is created, **\"He is an unbeliever, so kill him.\"** He said in the version of Ibn Nafi', \"He should be flogged and painfully beaten and imprisoned until he repents.\" In the version of Bishr ibn Bakr at-Tinnisi we find, \"**He is killed and his repentance is not accepted.**\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would mean majority Muslims now technically consider 'islamic golden age' caliph Al Mamun to be a vile heretic. \n\nThe ulema and the major Islamic law schools became truly defined in the period of al-Ma'mun, and Sunnism—as a religion of legalism—became defined in parallel. Doctrinal differences between Sunni and Shi'a Islam began to become more pronounced. Ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali legal school, became famous for his opposition to the mihna. Al-Ma'mun's simultaneous opposition and patronage of intellectuals led to the emergence of important dialogues on both secular and religious affairs, and the Bayt al-Hikma became an important center of translation for Greek and other ancient texts into Arabic. This Islamic renaissance spurred the rediscovery of Hellenism and ensured the survival of these texts into the European renaissance.\n\nAl-Ma'mun also attempted to divorce his wife during his reign, who had not borne him any children. His wife hired a Syrian judge of her own before al-Ma'mun was able to select one himself; the judge, who sympathized with the caliph's wife, refused the divorce. Following al-Ma'mun's experience, no further Abbasid caliphs were to marry, preferring to find their heirs in the harem.",

I like to entertain notions contrary to what i actually believe. SO : If XYZ(you name the religion) are **right about Jesus** *then* 1 John 4, Romans 10:9 and other proof texts are subterfuge (actions which further themselves based on a deception) to ensure the conceit that \"Jesus is God\" lives by repetition. \n\nSo in this view it's a hybrid of Cargo-Cult and CopyMe. Christians are engaging in sympathetic magic. In the meme-like repetition re: *Jesus's deity* is the (bogus) conferral of his deity. This is the inadvertent conspiracy theory theory about Christianity. It lives simply by its own propagation - like panspermia. \n\nHow it originated isn't important since it's under the law of nature. IN summary: the theory here is people test eachother for their belief in Christ's divinity (i.e. the antichrist spirit or The Holy Spirit) just due to behavioural contagion. I do not believe a word of the above. I simply like to scenarioize from the perspective of \"another worldview\".\n\nI would get around to watch Ricky Gervais' \"The Invention of Lying\" it is however a long \"watch later\" list. Does anyone here give any value to this particular hypothetical take on Christianity?",

For context, I would describe myself as an agnostic-atheist. \n\nMainly, when I look at comparative religions, the one thing I don't see their advocates answer is the 'Problem of Evil' - of an omnibenevolent God existing while evil exists in our world. I am looking for arguments that can be put forth to reject or challenge the problem of evil, or those that can outright answer the question: how can a 'good' God really exist in our world where suffering seems to be the only universal certainty of our existence? \n\nMany thanks for any responses. This topic is of great interest to me.",

Rather than believing in the traditional concept of hell as a place of eternal suffering for those who have sinned, I believe that God is more merciful than that. It seems unfair to me that someone who may have made mistakes in their lifetime would be punished with eternal torment, rather than being given the opportunity to learn and grow from those mistakes.\n\nInstead, I believe that God is loving and understanding, and that everyone who has ever lived will have the opportunity to experience the love and joy of heaven. This doesn't mean that we should be free to live our lives however we please without consequence, but rather that we should be given the chance to learn and improve, rather than being subjected to endless suffering.\n\nIn my belief, the end of physical life does not mean the end of existence. Instead, I believe that our souls will continue on in some form, either in an afterlife or through some other means of spiritual existence. Whatever the case may be, I believe that God is loving and compassionate, and that ultimately, we will all be given the chance to experience the love and joy that God has to offer.\n\n Is there a religion similar to what I believe in?",

        "text": "The older I get and the more I go through the more I realize that \"God\" seems to be the catch all way to explain everything that happens in life and yet the existence of God takes mental gymnastics to \"prove\". I have read studied and practiced numerous religions and faiths trying to find one that works and I realize they all just use God as a focus for their own beliefs. Because of the way our brains work we want to understand and to be able to manipulate. That's how we survived as a species. Of the countless numbers of other life on this planet we are the only ones that have the ability to think about and communicate these concepts and yet we have no actual answer nor does any culture or people have an actual history of where they came from because we didn't always have language we just survived and as language evolved we began to make up stories of where we came from. It's like your life. You became aware you were alive at some point but you didn't always know it. People claim and believe all sorts of things but if God existed there would have to be a universal truth. All the stories about encounters with God come down to a person's perception of events and stories get manipulated. I never understood how so many fantastical things happen in stories and yet in real life no one ever experiences any of these things. We spend so much time debating but all of the debates come down to abstract concepts and beliefs. I see outrageous claims but yet these amazing things are so few and far between they seems to be preying on people's desperation not life. I see people claim to be able to heal uncurable diseases. Why aren't they just going to hospitals and curing wards full of people? There's always an excuse why  they don't. They want to believe they have this special power. Why would a universal God that created everything only choose very specific people or why would only some people know how to tap into power. Why would there be as many explanations for things a s there are cultures and people. Why would Jesus only appear to his followers and not to all the multitude of people who called for his death. Why would Mohammed receive revelation in a cave from a spirit. Why is it that it's always one person. Why would Moses receive God's commandments alone? Why do people believe that they can perform rituals and incantations to get rich or have love but there are more people none of this works for. There are always reasons why but they always come down to not really explaining anything other than saying well it must be because you don't believe or there must have been a reason God didn't want to do this. We are pattern seeking mammals. We want to maximize the things we consider good and minimize the things we consider bad and so we try to find patterns on how this happens not believing the actual most likely scenario which is that things just happen. We can control how we see things so when we decide to do something and see change we think it must be something magical when it's really just us. When we pray or meditate we are settings goals and intentions but we are also taking some kind of action to make it happen in our lives. We also don't want to die or lose people and things we love so we create all these ideas of resurrection or rebirth or eternal life. There is absolutely zero proof that anything is eternal yet we cling ro the idea that after this life we get eternal happiness or existence if we do something specific. Reincarnated enough times or praying ro the right God or living a certain way yet time and time again the world continues on and we continue to evolve our explanations as the world evolves. I don't see the hand of God in all this I just see the hand of Humans trying to exert control over the situations they encounter in life. We are not born with a universal understanding of God. We are taught by our culture and then as we go through life we form our own opinions and conclusions. Sorry for the long post but this has been on my mind so much and I just needed to get it out. Everything I read is someone's hope or belief that something is true and yet there's no actual proof. Every \"supernatural\" experience I've had has a natural explanation if I'm honest about it.",

If you believe in heaven, do you think someone can go from heaven to hell in the afterlife? I mean after all, Satan is supposed to have turned evil in heaven. I know that most Jews don’t believe in a Christian like devil (or afterlife lol) but I am still curious for thoughts on the matter. Conversely, do you think someone can get out of hell and go to heaven after death?",

From top to bottom, players, announcers, coaches, fans, invoking God and prayer so freely-on air, on field in press conferences.  This despite an increasing number of people saying they don’t believe in God.  \n\nIs this due to the raw and desperate nature of the incident forcing an artifice-free reaction?  Is it due to the higher percentage of Black Americans believing in God, and the rest of us following their lead?  Are people joining in because they want to believe/belong, despite their true beliefs?\n\nI find it astonishingly beautiful.",
