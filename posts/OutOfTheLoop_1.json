        "text": "A friend of mine shared something in Slack about Questionable Content ending after 5000 strips. I remembered reading QC years ago, but I don't think I've read it since around 2005 due to lack of interest and I was impressed that it was still running after ~20 years. I went to check out the comic's page and saw that it's up to strip #5003, and it doesn't seem to be wrapping anything up. I clicked back to strip 5000 to see if there was an explanation for anything, but there's just a regular comic (I have no idea what's going on in the story, but it doesn't seem to be significant in any way) and a message from the creator saying that the comic isn't ending. I was confused, so I did a bit of searching and the first thing I found was that there are two subreddits for the comic: /r/qcontent which is less popular but seems to support the comic, and /r/questionablecontent which is larger but is much more critical of the comic. The latter has posts decrying the comic with people [very publicly announcing that they're going to stop reading it](https://www.reddit.com/r/questionablecontent/comments/11oewmk/the_end/), and some even giving advice on how to [avoid the comic entirely](https://www.reddit.com/r/questionablecontent/comments/11ngjwt/happy_5k_heres_how_to_say_goodbye_forever_on/).\n\nFrom what I've been able to tell, it seems like a lot of people expected the comic to wrap up when it hit 5000, there's some sort of wedding that people were anticipating that would end the comic, and that some people in both subreddits think the comic has gone downhill recently (though I can't tell if the dissenters are a majority or vocal minority). So my question is why are so many people \"quitting\" the comic at this point, and was there ever any significance in the 5000th strip?",

Typically, Twitter is pretty supportive of Trans people, but this one they've seemed to take an issue with. A quick Google search of Dylan Mulvaney shows that they are a TikTok influencer that documented their transition, so it doesn't appear to be someone that was temporarily impersonating someone who is trans. \n\nI guess I just don't understand why this situation has caused a stir when Twitter is generally pretty trans-positive.",
