        "text": "The vast majority of successful online businesses are created by young people. In fact, not infrequently, it is the very young who come up with ideas. Of course, they may already be of legal age by the time their business reaches regional, national, or even global recognition.\n\nHowever, countries only allow adults to start businesses. What should you do if you are still too young, but you want to start a business and you have a very good idea? You can ask your parents to start a business in their own name, but for you. Open a bank account where your money can go... Well, these things don't usually work out. Don't forget that it is your environment that has the least confidence in your success, your idea is good.\n\nWhat can you do then?\n\n1. Avoid ideas where income comes from ads (you have to sign contracts and you can't do that)\n\n2. Avoid ideas where the income is provided by payments from companies (sales and services to companies...)\n\n3. Find an idea that meets the above findings, but can generate income.\n\nHow come there isn't one? You are wrong! Your customers can also pay by sending money from their mobile phone to your mobile phone. But what kind of idea meets such a condition? More than a hundred. I will list a few in the introduction:\n\n1. Internet beauty contest, where voters can vote for the pictures of the girls on your page after sending the voting fee.\n\n2. Tutoring: You can teach what you know. Let's say mobile use, use of computer programs...\n\n3. Mail partner finder, where the young person looking for a partner writes their biography and what kind of partner they are looking for, and after the fee sent from their mobile phone, you display it anonymously with a password on your page. If the interested party receives an answer to the password, you send him the answer.",

Some people decide to change their lifestyle after a serious health problem or accident. However, in these cases, they are often forced to change because of their unfortunate circumstances.  \n\nI experienced some significant changes in my life, including enrolling in a university and temporarily living in another city, as well as traveling to the USA and England for work, but these were all temporary decisions. My first permanent change occurred when I relocated to a new city in my home country for a better job and quality of life.  Although I was initially apprehensive, I quickly adjusted to my new surroundings.  \n\nAdditionally, purchasing a new flat and deciding where to live was a significant change for me. Along the way, I also experienced minor changes in my everyday life that helped fulfill my needs.  \n\nLater, after I met the love of my life, we decided to get married ‚Äì however, it was a different change, something that came on its own, not by force like the changes I mentioned above.  \n\nPerhaps none of my personal changes were as big as my wife‚Äôs major change when she decided to live thousands of kilometers away from her home country though.  \n\nAlong the way, I am also making minor changes in my everyday life that help to fulfill my needs. Throughout our lives, we are continuously making choices and carrying out small modifications at every moment.",

Here's a little bit of it :\n\nMany years ago, God made Angels, Demons &amp; Earthlings. They all cared for each other and God. One day, the eldest of the angels made a prophecy saying That Humans will steal the secret of immortality and will defeat the God. King of the Demons, being immortal, who cared &amp; loved for the god more than anyone else, set war against humanity. God, who didn't wanted their children to fight, had no choice but to let them fight cause he believed in the prophecy. And the war started. \n\nIn the war, The demon king started to lose against humans. So he went to 'Death' &amp; made a deal with him. \"Help me win this war and I'll help you in future when the humans steal the immortality, for the prophecy can't be denied\". Death, who is always fair, was afraid that he will lose his job, helped demon king win the war. God, Who was in distress, got angry on demon king for their cowardice and banished him to underworld. He made sure that death won't do anything in future that's not justice.\n\nYears later, after long inactivity from God, humans won over the angels, captured them, cause they thought secret of immortality lies to the angels. A human who was friends with one of the angels, couldn't see her suffer. So he embarkes on an adventure with his 3 friends, to find demon king and convince him to talk with death as it's demon king's part to keep his promise.\n \nAnyways, sorry for that long text lol. I have made almost all of the story in mind. I haven't wrote it down anywhere yet. \n\nDo you guys have an imaginary story like this? It's could be sci-fi, adventure, comedy or romantic, drama etc. Most of times, we don't write it and it's just in our mind but you guys can tell me about a part or a summary of it.

The man offered to drive us there, saying he was headed in that direction. Bob and I were tired and kind of agreed, but John refused, citing his mother's warning never to go with strangers. We didn't want to leave John alone, so we declined the man's offer and said we would walk home with our friend. The man insisted that he could drive us and said it was not a problem, but eventually let us go. Sometimes, I wonder if the man was genuinely trying to help us or if he had ulterior motives and John's refusal saved us from harm.",

        "text": "Like 99.8% of the World population, me no like-a the dentist. Many a moon ago, I was working as a salesman and got to this dentist's office. Dr. Hector and I have the same birth day, except he was born one year earlier. Since I visited his place o'business frequently, I would stop by and chat. One time, I noticed that he was staring at me. Out of the blue, he pulls out a Kleenex, pulls down me lower lip, makes a cursory and asks me \"latinloner, when was the last time you got a cleaning?\"\n\nIt was the beginning of a beautiful friendship, as Rick Blaine of *Rick's Caf√© Americain* would say. \n\nWe've been good friends in thick and thin. He's given me 2 molar crown, not *gratis* but at cost. Damn, he's a good dentist: the only thing that has ever hurt were the novocaine injections, very light tough, very thorough. Also, 1 of only 2 veterinary dentists in the region.\n\nBut, what really got me in the feels was about mid January. Dr. H was in a tight spot and called me up and said if I could loan him some money to pay his home light bill, I could hear his voice cracking up. I had recently gotten a severance payment so I immediately said yes. Dr. H told me I would have me money back in a week or so. \n\nA week or so later, I have the money in my pocket and Dr. H's hand in mine. He looks me in the eye and says \"latinloner, you have free dental care *for life*. Take that to the bank.\"\n\nHell, in the last 2-3 week I've gotten a thorough cleaning, some cavity Mafia hits and replacing some expired repairs. When this is done, Dr. H is gonna give the ol' rocky skull pegs a whitening. \n\nI feel that I couldn't thank him enough. Sometimes I feel embarrased not paying him, but I wouldn't have good dental health without him. I tell **errybody** about him and I've been told that if you say \"latinloner sent me.\", Dr. H gives you a discount.\n\nI wanted to share this story about my good &amp; dear friend Dr. Hector. He's having a baby soon too, number #2!",

Hilarious:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHomer Simpson: Hey there, Bertrand! Did you know that balloons are the coolest things ever?\n\nBertrand Russell: Hello, Homer. I'm not sure I would agree with that statement. While balloons can certainly be entertaining, I wouldn't call them the coolest things ever.\n\nHomer Simpson: Oh come on, Bertrand. Balloons are amazing! They come in all shapes and sizes, and you can fill them with air or helium and make them float. Plus, they're great for parties and decorations.\n\nBertrand Russell: I don't dispute that balloons can be fun, Homer. But from a philosophical perspective, there's not much to say about them. They're just objects that can be inflated with gas.\n\nHomer Simpson: What? That's it? You're not gonna get all deep and philosophical on me?\n\nBertrand Russell: Well, there's not much depth to explore when it comes to balloons, Homer. They're simply a physical phenomenon that can be observed and explained by science.\n\nHomer Simpson: But what about the emotions they evoke? The joy they bring to kids' faces? The sense of wonder when you release a bunch of them into the sky?\n\nBertrand Russell: Those are valid experiences, Homer, but they're not unique to balloons. Many things can evoke emotions and create a sense of wonder. I think it's important to remember that while balloons may be entertaining, they don't hold much significance in the grand scheme of things.\n\nHomer Simpson: Hmm, I guess I never thought of it that way. I still think balloons are pretty awesome, though.\n\nBertrand Russell: And there's nothing wrong with that, Homer. As long as we recognize that their significance is limited, we can enjoy them for what they are.",

I'm working on backup plans to get us out of the country if it comes down to it. \n\nMaybe it's a product of being the son of a military man, where for the first half of my life we were moving on to whole new places every few years. But I don't get being loyal to a place.\n\nI can understand being loyal to a community, to a point. They're your people. Your friends, your family, your neighbors. Your tribe, so to speak. But when that community hurts you? Actively wishes you ill? Refuses to consider you one of them? Some people, given the opportunity to leave for greener pastures, choose to say \"No. I'm going to make this place better from within. I'm staying.\" Even if it means putting themselves and their family through more hurt. \n\nMaybe I'm selfish. I'll own that. But I just don't get it. Can someone explain it to me?",

        "text": "Hello! On mobile so apologies if formatting is weird. I posted this in the cottage core subreddit but received no engagement. I would like some input from artists and creators out there, disabled folks and accessibility allies as well. Really, any and all who this may apply to. I have this grand plan and life goal but I wanted to bounce ideas off people. \n\nMy partner are in the planning stages of a large move. We are very grateful to be in a position where we plan to buy a large piece of property. We have been working towards this for 12 years and we are very close. It started as a dream for just the two of us, to live, hike, and preserve our own land but it grew into something larger the more we thought about what we could do with this property. \n\nOur plan includes sharing the land and making it accessible for those who need it. It will be our property and our home. But we‚Äôd like to be able to share it with others. A safe place for folks to experience nature. \n\nThis idea came about from cottage core inspired posts all across Instagram. Seeing beautiful humans in their fairy costumes and witchy outfits out in the woods. Vikings with handmade shields. Garden weddings. Ah! So cool! One of my favorite disabled creators was modeling an amazing gown she made and taking photos including her mobility aid. She made a reel about the difficulties of navigating the terrain to get a good location for the photo shoot. I thought ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt it be cool to make an accessible trail to a pretty spot for her to take photos?‚Äù \n\nOf course, the train went off the rails from there and our ‚Äúplans‚Äù for our future home turned into what my partner best describes as ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building the Enchanted Forest.‚Äù (If you are unfamiliar, google it. Turner, OR.)\n\nWe talk about building a cabin that could not only be a place for our friends and family to stay but as a ‚Äúlocation‚Äù and make it accessible as well. Accessible as in ADA compliant and as accommodating as we can make it. We talk about being a venue for small ceremonies. (Partner is ordained.) Cottage core, D&amp;D themed, any ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù wedding. Other structures for an artist‚Äôs retreat. Locations for photo shoots. \n\nThe main outcome I‚Äôd like to see from this goal, if things came to fruition, is a space in a beautiful wooded area that is accessible, absolutely inclusive, and safe. Everybody deserves to enjoy nature and it‚Äôs not always accessible to folks. I want to change that. Not trying to build an amusement park or summer camp. Kind of like an more interactive VRBO? Not hundreds of people at a time. Again, preserve the land, don‚Äôt disrupt neighbors, etc. \n\nIf you are still reading, thanks for sticking with me. With ALL that background information, I have a question. How do I not weirdly say, ‚ÄúCome out to our private woods in the middle of nowhere to take your tiktoks!‚Äù?\n\nI‚Äôm kidding about the phrasing, of course. However, if I was looking for a place to shoot, even if it sounded awesome, I would personally be a little hesitant, especially in our early stages. In hindsight, I had my senior pictures done on the lovely property owned by the photographer so maybe it‚Äôs similar? Obviously I would ‚Äúmarket‚Äù, for lack of a better term, in reputable ways. Meet with community groups, follow any ordinances, laws, etc. But I still worry people might say, ‚ÄúHeck no. This is how horror movies start!‚Äù\n\nWith that said, what would you think about something like this? Have you come across anything similar? I would say my mission statement would be ‚ÄúMake Nature Accessible for all.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm kind of just bouncing ideas around hence the sporadic nature of this post. I invite and appreciate any input, questions, and feedback. \n\nWith gratitude.",

Relationships lasting anywhere from 3 months to 1 yr and 3 months. Mostly on the longer end. \n\nToday, I broke up with probably the nicest and most understanding person I've ever dated in these 5 years. He told me he was proud of me after I broke up with him. Like who does that. We're probably going to remain friends once we've both healed from the initial transition(we only dated for like 2 months and were friends before). \n\nBut anyways, I am really proud of myself for finally making this a reality. I've been dreaming of this day for a few years and I finally had the strength to make it happen. I don't really know what to do now. I'm currently solo backpacking in Europe which was one of my lifelong dreams. It's great! \n\nI dont have a huge friend circle so I'm worried I'll be lonely. Any tips for being single?",

There will be liquor served and he says I have a tendency to get flirty when I'm drunk and said if I come home wasted he'll be pissed. He's convinced I'm gonna cheat or something even though I never would.\n\nI told him I won't even go if it matters that much to him but now he's saying he doesn't mind if I go.

Nothing abnormal for anyone.\n\nNormally, I remember those moments and ... while I cringe a little... I use them as a benchmark for how far I've come as a person in that time. And I kind of take pride in my progress.\n\nNormally, I'd guess I relived those moments every few weeks, maybe once a month.\n\nLately, it's been multiple times a day, and I can not figure out why.\n\nMy best guess is that I am suffering from cabin fever waiting out the cold, combined with a promotion at work that's been extremely challenging to this point. That's all that's changed in the last few months.\n\nI don't know. It's not crippling me, I still work and live just fine. It just seems strange that this happens so often now.",
