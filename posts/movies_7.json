Do you know any good films made on a less than $50k budget because I want to watch some. I hear Tubi has some. I suspect Netflix and YouTube have a few, but they aren't popping up on my algorithm, so I am hoping to find some recommendations including what platform I can watch them on.

        "text": "**Quality of the film:**\n\nThe film was overall done at the same quality of Joe Dirt, Office Space, and other cult classic films destined for Comedy Central releases. Entertaining for a background or repeat watch but not something that stands very strong on its own.\n\nFor me, it's really hard to identify the exact elements that make a film seem \"cheap\", but all I know is that if I saw Idiocracy on constant reply on the oldschool Comedy Central TV era, it wouldn't have surprised me.\n\n**Pretentiousness:**\n\nI heard enough comments about how Idiocracy was \"a prediction of the future\" from Reddit that I finally decided to give it a watch.\n\nBut oh my gosh, the pretentiousness of the thing.\n\nAnd it wasn't even sly, undertoned pretentiousness. It was blatant, rednecks are bad, overproducing, yee-haw-ers. I'm sure to an extent Mike Judge thought he was just being funny BECAUSE of how blatant it was, but boy it does seem that a lot of people with an air of superiority have latched onto the film.\n\n**Actively Harmful:**\n\nThe \"idiots over-reproduce\" theme is remarkably disgusting. Like to the point where I don't even want to share the film with friends now.\n\nWhen we are still in a world where people are blaming genetics for success and intelligence, rather than the many societal and systemic issues people face - especially non-whites - making \"dumb people reproduce a lot hhurrr durrr\" a critical message of the film was at minimum in poor taste.\n\nSeriously I would LIKE to think that Mike Judge, who seems to be an overall decent guy, didn't mean for the messaging to be that way. So I'll call it irresponsible negligence on his part, rather than deliberate.\n\nBut this messaging is one of the core foundational arguments of ultra right-wing, militant/fascist groups - that Jewish / Blacks / non-Aryan / etc - people are somehow inherently inferior and that their reproduction is polluting / harming society.\n\nMaking it redneck conservatives / culture-based rather than race-based doesn't make it any more acceptable, in my opinion.\n\n**Overall Rating:**\n\n3/10\n\nI get a few chuckles but I sadly can't recommend the film to anyone else, the film doesn't sit well with me after the fact, and it has one of the most pretentious fanbases I've seen in a while.",

I was stoked.\n\nFast forward to 2006. I’m sitting in my bedroom, watching the Starz channel, and “Son of the Mask” comes on. I decided to watch it, of course, and for the rest of my life I have to live with the consequences of my decision. \n\nIt was the biggest piece of shit I’d ever seen. It was stupid, annoying, unfunny, badly written, horribly acted, the special effects were abysmal, it was downright terrifying at times, and Bob Hoskins—BOB FUCKING HOSKINS—had an embarrassing cameo as Odin the All-Father. \n\nIt was the first time I can remember really hating a movie on a visceral level.",

And someone else has already written it for you... All you had to do was not screw it up. \n\nSeriously.... It's embarrassing and I'm not watching with anyone, I didn't buy a ticket to see it (Netflix), and I didn't recommend it to anyone.... But it's EMBARRASSING me for everyone involved. \n\nThe filmmakers understand they're making a movie based on one that's very nostalgic for people and what's the first thing they do? THROW A GAMEBOY IN THE GARBAGE? WHAAAAAAT? It really doesn't get any better from there.... \n\nLebron is not a good actor so why have him act so much?\n\nJust bring in Bugs early, have the Monstars go crazy, and Lebron saves the day.... It's really not complicated. 1.5 hours max. \n\nAnd 2 hours? Good God that's WAY too long. \n\nThey story was way too complicated for no reason. It was all around just a bunch of BS just to try to bring an emotional attachment into the movie. Of course he loves his kid, jesus, but it's not about that.... This is supposed to be Space Jam! \n\nJust all around awful.\n\nTL;DR... Space Jam A New Legacy uneccesarily gets away from literally everything that made the original movie good.",

And it’s almost been 50 years since AH Was released. For example, when I was young, American Pie was hilarious. And Scary Movie. I’m sure over time in like 20 years, kids will see it and say “this movie is old, I don’t get it…” I feel like Airplane was like that too.

From Lucas developing the original idea to casting the characters and building the universe with the help of Ralph McQuarrie’s concept art.  \n\nThen the financial troubles with Lucas trying to get the movie funded from the studios and ultimately negotiating the *brilliant* deal giving him control over merchandising the films.\n\nDuring the production, Lucas was so stressed out from directing and doing basically everything that he nearly had a heart attack- there could be some really intense scenes about that\n\nThe film could spend some time showing the geniuses that ended up starting ILM and how the new camera tech was implemented into the scenes\n\nInclude Ben Burt and John Williams doing their things of course\n\nCan’t forget the fact that Lucas’ wife basically *saved* the film with her editing\n\nI could honestly go on and on, I think this story is so rich and fascinating and would make for a terrific movie.  At its core it’s basically about a guy with an artistic vision who never gave up on it despite so many setbacks and so little encouragement from the people around him and it paid off in spades.\n\nI don’t consider myself much of a “film buff”, but as a “movie fan”, I would really enjoy this.",

And now because the audience who grew up in the 80s and 90s are full on adults its pretty clear what people want to see. Which is the oldschool marvel paradigm which made marvel popular in the first place.\n\nPeople want to see\n\n- The Xmen\n- The Fantastic Four\n- Hulk \n- Blade\n- Spiderman \n\nFor those of you new to marvel, these are the properties that made marvel extremly popular in the late 80s thru the earlt 2000s. And because much of the now adult audience is in their peak money making years this is what we want. I personally feel like the old MCU could just be regulated to one aveneger film every other year and tie up loose ends on tv.\n\nI know it wont happen cause of contracts but in an ideal world Marvel would just hard launch phase 5 with Xmen. Have it be a soft reboot in tone. \nAnd it would make since as people would begin to HATE superheroes due to the snap. Also with their foodsources disappearing it would explain why so many vampires are being bold now\nThe fantastic four are apart of the government so theyll be unaffected. And hulk is hulk. Also the MCU should take on a darker tone. Not the grim and gritty tone of the 2000s, but a tone more akin to Nolan or Ridley scott. They have the budget, i think they should move away from the TV feel and every MCU film should be a prestige film.",

Though Alex Jones the conspiracy theorist has been around for awhile he was a little less famous at this point in time. Detective Loki in the beginning talks about Alex Jones having the iq of a 10 year old and not mentally capable of kidnapping because he is a nimwit. You also see Detective Loki’s Gold ring which has the Freemason symbol “a secret society”. Then of course the movie unravels with this kidnapping children secret cult that turns out to actually be real. The movie itself is called Prisoners.😳 HOLD UP FBI IS OUTSIDE",

        "text": "I just finished watching Saving Private Ryan for maybe the 3rd or 4th time the whole way through, and most of it is as I remembered, however this time whenever watching the death scene of Irwin Wade, I was completely drawn in and felt like I was with the squad watching this man go through all five stages of grief in a scene under 5 minutes long.\n\nFirstly, I have to mention the bleeding of Wade's wounds. The bleeding of his wounds just flowing and flowing without stopping after they clean his torso off over and over with water is almost nauseating. This was the most convincing and \"realistic\" depiction of \"bleeding out\" I've seen in a movie or on TV. Not only that but the sheer panic and fumbling around with medical instruments of Wade's squad mates as they try to help him set the tone for the whole scene as being out of their control.\n\nThe way that Wade goes from scared, but hopeful that it isn't as bad as he thought or that they can still stop the bleeding, to realizing when his hand is guided to his wound that \"is bleeding more than the others\" he screams out in panic and realization \"Oh god, my liver.\" as he knew he was dying at exactly that moment.\n\nThere are so many parts of this scene that are just so grisly and surreal it is hard to think of any scene in any other movie of any genre that genuinely made me feel emotions like this scene did. I felt sympathy, empathy, fear, and an actual knot in my stomach during the entire scene up until Wade died.\n\nDo you have any scenes that stand out as making you feel this way? I literally watched the movie last night and have been thinking about Wade's death in particular the entire day today and how amazing it is that a film can make me feel grief in a way.",

        "text": "I know it's been three months since Christmas but the sequel is releasing soon so I guess this is as good a time as any and just hear me out.  \nI wholeheartedly believe that **Shazam (2019) should be remembered as a christmas film**, and could be watched as part of the rotation of christmas films in many family's traditions.  \n  \n\nFirst of all, the film has the sincerity of 90's christmas movies. The whole plot revolves around Billy, who tried to find his family, and ended up finding the family he needed, but not exactly the one he searched for. There's no lampshading, or meta jokes. Most of the humor comes from the absurdity of the situation, of a kid who somehow turned into a superpowered adult and all that it entails. It really is more Big (1988) with superpowers as the cast and crew called it. \n\n\nThere's a heartfelt scene lost on many superhero films nowadays, about Billy overhearing his foster parents say that it's Billy's choice to call their house a home, but they will still give him a place full of love regardless.  This scene resonated with me since I recently moved 700 miles to college while seeing this film in theatres, and this film taught me that even if my biological family is hundred of miles away, I can still find a family in college that could help me through the hard times, and luckily, I did.\n  \n\nOf course, like the old classics there is an out-of-place [horror scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB2bRJ2jvPM) that just pops out of nowhere just like 80's and 90's flicks (called kindertrauma), and is surely to be removed from movies aimed to kids nowadays. The best thing is that the horror scene directly follows the heartfelt scene, so audiences would definitely be surprised by the sudden change in tone (and remembering the shouts of the people around me, they definitely did).\n  \nAnd... that's it. I don't want to spoil a film that released only four years ago, so watch it on your own time and tell me if you agree. Shazam (2019) is so precious a movie to bundle it with the other grimdark and dour films of the DCEU, and it could definitely be watched standalone without watching any other DCEU film.",

I think Scorsese has had some great effects in his films, although I was disappointed with a few of the cgi blood effects in The Irishman. \n\nObviously the credit is also massively due to the effects crew but you can also notice appreciate the directors who consistently picked crew members well.",
