I've been getting really good performance reviews and last year accepted a large counter-offer to stay as the pay was my only real issue when I was about to accept another offer. The job has its downsides, but I work with a great tech stack, a tech-focused company, I'm happy with my pay, and work on lots of interesting projects.\n\nDuring covid I spent some time working remotely in a new city with unofficial approval from my manager and loved it out there, my mental health was significantly better and I made a ton of new friends. Unfortunately, I had to move back home with my family again after 4 months due to a 3-day office mandate. \n\nIt has been 5 months at home now, and I feel like I am regressing in terms of growing as an adult living back at home and I'm at the point where I'm about to say screw it and just move anyway and worst-case life off my emergency fund for a bit. Unfortunately, the job search has not been going well with the current job market and my low years of experience. I received a few offers so far, but they were either too far below my current pay or just a step back in terms of career growth.\n\nIn the 5 months, I've been home, almost no one has complied with the office mandate and I've gone in a total of 5 days. Additionally, there are many employees at my company all around the country that continue to work remotely, however, HR is not allowing people to change work statuses at this time. I'm thinking of just telling my manager that I would like to stay, but need to move on X date. I have asked in the past about getting remote status officially and my manager supports it (he doesn't show up to the office either), but because of HR \"freeze\" on work statuses I haven't been able to get it.\n\nHow could I propose this to my manager in a way that indicates I'm willing to leave over this, but without risking my job and relations with him at the same time?",

During that time, I've worked for two companies, a large Fortune 100 company and a smaller company. \n\nCompared to when I was job hunting in 2022, this market is way different. Even if I have an internal referral for a role, I'm still getting automated rejection emails. The only recruiters who message me about fulltime positions are trying to pitch consulting firms or small startups (think 2-6 engineers in the entire company).\n\nNeither work environment seems ideal to me, but if I had to pick, I guess I would choose a consulting firm. My spouse is still employed and I have my own savings, so I'm hesitant to take something that doesn't align with what I want.\n\nFor those of you who have worked for a consulting firm, how was it? I understand that no two consulting companies will be the same, but I'm looking for a general overview of that space. If you were me, would you just be patient and wait until the job market bounces back? Obviously nobody can predict the future, but I'm curious to hear how long you all think that would take.",

How transferable is this to industry, provided I’m okay with another 1-year MSc in (bio)statistics/data science if needed? Alternate plan is to do an accelerated BSc in CS.\n\nHey everyone. I finished my Bachelor’s in Biomedical Science in Canada, and for a year after graduation, had worked in wet lab research. [After taking the time to explore my careers and interests](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/108lqd1/computer_science_biostatistics_health_informatics/), I was planning on doing an accelerated bachelor’s in CS + a master's in biostatistics. Through this, my goal was to do research using data science within a biomedical/clinical context, while also having robust credentials for industry if things go awry.\n\nHowever, I recently got offered a fully-funded Master’s position by one of my professors. They are primarily appointed in the CS department, with research in ML for drug discovery, cancer biology, etc. The project aligns very well with my interests, however, as my current credentials are in biomedical science (not CS), he is only able to offer the position through a Master's in Biology, as opposed to a Master'ss in CS.\n\nThat being said:\n\n* How transferrable would this MSc in Biology be towards the general CS/DS/ML industry? \n* Overall, provided my interests, would this be a wise decision career-wise?\n\nI’m also fine with doing another internship-based MSc in (bio)statistics or data science after this program, if need be (e.g. if the MSc in Bio isn’t recognized). I would have enrolled in those directly if it weren’t for missing prerequisite courses (which I plan on taking in the BSc in CS or MSc in Bio).",

Would this dead-end my SWE career? I'm hoping to use it sort of as a mental reset period, prep more LC and maybe work on some personal projects, but ultimately return to SWE after a break.",

        "text": "I have about 3 years dev experience and joined my current company 2 years ago because I felt like I wasn't learning much at my old job. The main reason why I joined my current company was that it offered better career progression and the team I joined had several senior/principal-level engineers that I felt I could learn a lot from. All of them but one left in my first year and now the last one is also leaving. There is no indication that we will be able to backfill the role as my company is not very competitive in terms of compensation. \n\nWhile I do feel like I learned quite a bit during the last two years, I got very disappointed when my manager called me to tell me that I need to step up more and act as a senior. While this is definitely what my career aspirations are, I already struggle as a mid-level with the load and the fact that half of the team is people who don't do anything. I am now the most senior member of the team and while one of the juniors is pretty self-sufficient and doesn't need much support, we have another two that I just don't feel I can work with or at least not with both of them being on the team. \n\nOne of these people is a BootCamp graduate, who takes more than a week to complete a ticket that is a one-line change like removing a feature flag or renaming something. After observing her for the last 6 months (she has been in the team for about 9), I am convinced that she is taking advantage of the remote work and not doing anything or even staying at her computer. Even if I give her clear instructions on what to do and she has done it numerous times (we have some tickets that are pretty much the same changes over and over again and each ticket has specific instructions on which files to change so that it can be picked up by anyone), she still takes 7 working days to raise a PR. A PR with literally one changed line. \n\nThe other junior we have is actually an intern and has 0 knowledge but at least tries to do stuff. He has a very frustrating habit to argue about stuff, e.g. he read somewhere that something can be used in a certain way and then pair programs with me and argues why we don't do it when it is something completely unrelated to our stack. This happens frequently and not only when he pairs with me.\n\nI have been trying my best to support them and have been making sure there are very tiny tickets that can be picked up by either of them so they get experience in making any sort of code changes but I am honestly so tired and frustrated and I don't know how to explain all of this to my manager without sounding like a bitter dev who doesn't like juniors.  I feel like I still need guidance and mentorship for some of my work and I can't deal mentally with supporting 2 more people. It was manageable while we had an actual senior developer but I don't think I can do it now. \n\n  \nOtherwise, I would prefer not to change the company as my current one supports full remote, my manager and PO are very nice, we don't have any strict deadlines, overtime or micromanaging or anything, the stack is modern, even without a very competitive compensation package my salary is still okay and with all recent layoffs and the state of the market in the UK, I really wish I wasn't thinking about leaving.   \nI want to talk to my manager about the team but I don't want to make it sound like I hate the juniors,  I just feel like I can't deal with them while also still doing a lot of learning myself.",

Or someone's like \"gonna go set up for my daughter's birthday party\" and they basically either worked a half day, or finish some work at night. And people are fine with that.

        "text": "Hey all I need some career advice. I’m a new grad Sales Engineer. As a sales engineer our compensation is called OTE (On Target Earnings). Our base salary ratio to commission is usually a ratio of approximately 70:30. I have a little over a year of experience and my breakdown is as follows\n\nBase Salary: 100k\nStock: 5K\nCommission (expected): 25k\n\nThis brings me to an OTE of 125k and TC (total compensation of 130k) While commission isn’t guaranteed we historically hit quota quite a bit and last year I exceeded my previous OTE of 100k by about 15k. Within my new role based off Q1 alone I’m expecting to make at minimum my OTE and despite the economy anywhere from 140-150k\n\nAt 3-5 years of experience at top companies I can expect 200-250 OTE plus some equity but not as much as Engineers with similar years of experience in their field. \n\nWith all that said I’ve always liked programming and have taken a few intro to CS courses (CS 101/102 + discreet math + assembly) alongside my degree (MIS) I’ve also practiced some leetcode and am brushing up on DS/Algos. If I managed to switch to software engineering within my company (huge preference for internal hires) my base would be 120kish with TC at about 150k for a new grad role. \n\nI’m currently weighing switching because despite my field allowing remote work and flexible hours (love it) frequent travel will likely be a reality for me as I become a Sr. Sales Engineer. That being said, will software engineers out earn me considerably around the senior level? I have the soft skills for sales based on success in this role and sales jobs I had in college but at heart I’m an introvert who would like to minimize customer interaction. Also anyone who has taken a similar route advice would be much appreciated.",

I'm a self taught full-stack web developer looking to acquire their first job. I do have a STEM degree, but it's not CS-related.\n\nI realize that the duties of a support engineer can vary widely by company, but based off of speaking with my contact at the company, the role at this particular company would include:\n\n* Deal with technical issues relayed to the support engineer by the customer support team.\n* Focus on bugfixes and automating processes where possible.\n* If desired, work on tickets for the development team if there's free time.\n\nMy contact said that a successful candidate in this role would be promoted to a product developer after around a year with the company. Also, the qualifications listed for the job were those of a full-stack web developer, and the job description said they were looking for a web developer to fill the position.\n\ntbh, it sounds like a good opportunity to me. I've read that some people end up getting lured into the title of \"support engineer\" just to have it end up being more of a help desk position that doesn't involve any development, but if the job description is to be believed, then I don't think that's the case with this company. Being a non-CS graduate who's self-taught, it seems that my options in the current job market are incredibly limited. The pay for the role is pretty good, and I figure that at the very least, it would look a lot better on my resume for future web developer applications compared to my current non-tech job.\n\nThoughts?

        "text": "I’m about 1.3 years into my first job. I work for a large bank. Due to our releases interrupting business to customers, we have to do releases overnight. Typically when I attend one, I log on at 11 PM on a Friday. Several times, I have been online until 5 AM. The worst case scenario: 8 AM- best case scenario: 2 AM. And this is always after working a normal day. There’s not really any official compensation for doing this, so I never like it. It used to only happen once a month, but lately we have been doing like 2 per month. The senior devs go to almost every release. Then Monday after, everyone logs back in at 8 AM as usual. No one ever seems bothered by it, but the all-nighters kinda wreck my weekends. The fact that I hear no one else complain makes me feel like a slacker for not linking this.\n\nI have looked up this topic and I don’t see other people talking about it, so, is this rare? Is it common? Should I just get used to it? Please share your thoughts and experiences. Thanks!",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nStruggling with how to approach a tricky situation at work, would really appreciate any and all advice!\n\nI've worked for the company I'm currently at for \\~8.5 years or so, starting a year after college. We're a small (\\~10-15 people) agency in a relatively small market. In October of last year, I was promoted to senior developer. However, this coincided with our most senior dev, let's call him Bill, leaving the company (on good terms, found a dream job elsewhere), as we were gearing up to start a large application project building off of a smaller project we'd built over the last couple of years for a government contractor (atypical for us, bulk of our clients have been local startups, we'd never, in my time, done any government or gov-adjacent work prior to this project). Needless to say, the project has and continues to involve some serious complexity, even without all the red tape we need to cut just to deliver our work. Another senior dev and myself were slated to fill in as co-team-leads. My bosses assured me the timing of my promotion was coincidental, that they had been thinking of giving me a raise for some time already.\n\nBetween team leadership not coming naturally to me, this project being super complex, to there being a pretty severe learning curve in adapting to Bill's absence (both his domain knowledge of the project and his expertise as a team lead), the last few months have been pretty hellish, to the point where I've started to think about resigning in the next couple of months. Honestly, I'd been thinking about leaving prior to all this, that I could really use a change, feeling I've gotten too comfortable and disengaged at this company after all this time.\n\nI'm worried about a few things, though:\n\n* Will a 6 month stint at my promoted position raise a red flag for future prospective employers, when I start applying for jobs again? I'm not sure how I could tactfully explain away why I left so soon after my promotion\n* Should I be worried that my employer might frame my resignation as screwing them over such that I couldn't use them as a reference going forward? I could see my resignation being received pretty poorly. The company doesn't have any immediate in-house fill-ins for me like they did for Bill, other than piling more on to the remaining senior dev or pushing a less senior person to take on more work. And, they've been struggling to recruit new staff. I plan to offer my resignation with some plan to stay a while longer to help offboard my responsibilities as best I can, to try to not burn any bridges and leave on good terms, but the pessimist in me feels the discussion could quickly get contentious. This has been my only job out of college, so dependent on using my experience here to fill out my resume.\n* On the flip side, am I just giving up too early? Does this situation sound like normalish growing pains?\n\nI could easily be overthinking and blowing all this out of proportion, but I can't help feeling I might be gearing up to get myself in a nasty bind if I don't handle this situation well. And to be perfectly honest, between struggling to grow into this new role and dealing with burnout, I haven't put my best foot forward at work recently, so I could see there being room for things to turn around. But while I've genuinely loved a lot of my time at the company, I am feeling increasingly skeptical that they value me in-line with how much work I do and that they have a plan for the company going forward other than hoping their current people don't burn out and walk.\n\nAlso, any tips on figuring out potential salaries to ask for in future employment? I have been given raises throughout my time with the company, but I think I may be currently underpaid for the amount of work I do / would expect to earn if working for a company in a larger market. An offhand comment about salaries when chatting with another employee makes me believe I'm not as highly paid as some people on staff with equivalent workloads, although they do have more years experience in the industry. \n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I was laid off and am now looking for a new job.\n\n1. I'm seeing many contract jobs (6mo-1yr) on job boards. I don't know much about working as a contractor, but my intuition (that is not really based on anything) tells me that it's better to get a full-time position at a company. I'm assuming as a contractor, you do not get full benefits and working hours are stricter because you're hourly? Again, don't know that much about contracting in the SWE industry.\n2. Consulting this early in my careers feels like it doesn't really make much sense...? I feel like it's important to have strong mentorship during your early engineering years to develop a strong foundation, and as a consultant, you're kind of just working on your own if I understand correctly? Would love to hear thoughts on this.\n3. I have had a couple recruiters from recruiting agencies reaching out to me on LinkedIn to talk about opportunities that might interest me. It kind of feels weird going through a middle-man (they talk about job opportunities at big companies, like Uber, Walmart, etc), and I've only ever talked to recruiters who work for the companies of interest in the past. Should I be weary about going through a third party recruiter?  \n\n\nTIA!!",

My plan has been to get a job and start working immediately as I don’t have the finances to stay for my masters, I always figured maybe somewhere down the line I could have a company pay for it. I have recently been offered a job for $75k in the Greater Boston area. However I was just informed that since I do research at my university that they would cover my masters if I decided to stay and keep doing research. The company that offered me the job isn’t that big or anything I was necessarily excited for, they were just the only job offer I have been able to get as of now. My options stand as to either take the job, or continue my education for another year and a half for free to receive my masters and then find a job after. I’m at a list of what direction I should take so any advice would be appreciated. Thank you",

        "text": "I've found a lot of questions about reneging on offers, but most seem to be related to quitting just before starting, which is not my situation.\n\nLong story short, I've been interviewing with companies A and B. A sent me an offer, which I thought was good, but I was also annoyed with them due to being slow on sending letter, not being sure on their tech stack, and other minor things. I stress \"minor\" things. The interviews for B finished up a week later, and they sent me an offer that was better than A. I formally accepted B (instead of immediately countering A, like an idiot) and sent A a note thanking them and declining.\n\nA responded that they would really like to counter no matter what and they really want me on board. I sent them a counter with a healthy raise on top of B's. They should reply later today, and they might decline anyway, since it's a bit much for the position. But assuming they do accept, how bad is it to have to contact B and say \"sorry, I'm actually out\". I really hate to do that, in general, but if A does accept I'm not sure I can turn it down.\n\nOther random info:  \n\\- A and B are in the same industry  \n\\- Both are very large companies, but not FAANG or anything  \n\\- It hasn't even been 24 work-hours since I submitted the paperwork, so it's not as if things are far along. Still breaking my word, though.",

We are very much committed, but the distance is emotionally trying for both of us. She is calling me for 4-5 hours a day. It has become a distraction from my work and is affecting my performance.\n\nI am considering asking to take a trip to be with her, and to work remote from Europe. I also do not like my current location and eventually want to move, although obviously not immediately (there is plenty of paperwork to get sorted first). I have a solid internet connection in Europe. How soon is too soon to ask to make this trip and to work long distance? Obviously I would work to North American hours and keep the job administratively in the US.",
