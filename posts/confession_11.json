I would wear a long sleeve shirt or sweatshirt and I would hide it in the sleeve while I vaped. If you hold the vapor in long enough you can exhale and nothing will come out. I put my head down on my desk and I exhaled but I didn’t hold it long enough and a bunch of vapor surrounded me. My teacher who was also my baseball coach gave me the most confused look because there was a white cloud around me but there was no smell and it just disappeared. 14 years later and this moment still makes me laugh.",

They usually tease me with little remarks on my height or weight  but the last straw was last week. A pencil was thrown at me and that was definitely my last straw. I demanded for them to apologize, but then again I was told I was overreacting. I decided to act like everything is fine so no one is suspicious, and I’m going to bake cookies for the whole class. I am however going to bake a batch specifically for this kid, but with laxatives in them. I’ve always been petty but was never one to act first when stuff like this happened. I’m planning on telling them that they ‘overreacted’ and if he’s insulting my baking skills as he is going to be the only one that will get sick since everyone else is getting a second batch.
