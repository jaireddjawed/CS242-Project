I enjoy the frequency range of that pair as well as the comfortability, but i‚Äôm looking for a pair of headphones to wear away from my desk, ie. laying in bed, going on walks, doing chores, etc. \n\n‚Ä¢ Budget: I‚Äôm willing to spend a bit over $200 but would like to keep it within that range.\n\n‚Ä¢ Source: I‚Äôll be using my iPhone 12 pro to stream music from. Wired headphones are fine, though i‚Äôd prefer bluetooth.\n\n‚Ä¢ Isolation: Don‚Äôt care too much about this, a little bit of noise cancellation would be nice, but it‚Äôs not too high of a priority.\n\n‚Ä¢ Yes, I will be using these headphones in public.\n\n‚Ä¢ Preferred Type: I think I‚Äôd like some on-ear headphones, as IEM‚Äôs usually irritate me or don‚Äôt fit, and my DT 770 are already full sized over-ear.\n\n‚Ä¢ Preferred Tonal Balance: Definitely need an overall tonally balanced pair.\n\n‚Ä¢ Past Headphones: DT 770 Pro. I love these things, only complaint is they hurt after wearing them for like 4 hours straight.\n\n‚Ä¢ Preferred music: Just about anything, but the top genres for me currently are punk, jazz, rap, metal, and all encompassing sub-genres.",

These troops were deployed under Germany. \n\nI think it fringes on glorification, although they also sing about every other significant figures/events in the same way.",
