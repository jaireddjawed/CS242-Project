        "text": "I am teaching my non-native English speaking elementary students to identify different syntactic elements in a sentence. We have just finished with noun phrases, and today we start working on verb phrases.\n\nMy plan was to represent an entire sentence as a verb phrase with its one, two or three arguments (no adjuncts for the time being) to show that the arguments are essential parts of a verb phrase if you want a complete sentence. My colleague disagreed with my approach, correctly stating that \"a sentence is a subject + a verb phrase\", according to how it's always taught.\n\n**But why is this the case? Why is the subject considered special when from a syntactic perspective it is simply another noun phrase and argument of the verb?**\n\nI looked for an answer in Kroeger's Analyzing Grammar, but it directs to his Analyzing Syntax (Chapter 2.3), which I don't have. The preview on Google Books redacts the relevant section of the book. \n\nIf anyone could help me understand why the subject is treated as special and not part of the verb phrase?",

Essentially, counting numbers are read like telephone numbers.\n\n709: seven zero nine\n\n565: five six five\n\nThere are two problems with this system, but I think I solved them.\n\nDifferentiating Actual Telephone Numbers: Either the word tele precedes the number, or the hyphens are read too. 123-456-7890 is thus read one two three dash four five six dash seven eight nine zero.\n\nRepeating Numbers: Obviously, saying one zero zero zero zero zero zero for one million is annoying, so we would need to create meta numbers (numbers that count numbers). We'll ask our friend Latin for help. One million would be one hex zero.\n\nMy question is: does a system similar to this exist in any of the world's languages?

Are there other languages or studies that have shown this? Perhaps Chicano English or Gullah English?\n\nAnecdotally, in regions of Catalonia there was a heavy Andalusian migration, but it didn't affect the Spanish accent despite them having Spanish as a native language. However, the Catalan is different, but instead of showing Andalusian cadence, the phonology is just more in line with Spanish as opposed to the Catalan in the surrounding regions. For example, instead of schwas, **some** pronounce them more open. \n\nBut this might not be related to migration, but the bilingualism of newer generations, which is probably how the other languages adapted their accents from one heritage language to the \"new\" language spoken.",

I know that the Indo-European gender system ultimately comes from a system of animacy distinction and its association with human gender is a later development, thus in many IE languages the masculine gender is used for words such as \"who\" as a holdover from when it used to mark animacy. Did something similar happen with the Semitic languages? The gender system in them seems more important for eg. the verbal morphology than for most IE languages.",

Quite clear, documented historical fact. Well known fact in fact. Why dance around the issue?\n\nOr watched one last night on the 1942 Fall of Singapore, where the Japanese \"unalived\" 5,000 allies, I mean, they were very well known to be killed in action, and then they \"unalived\" around 74,000 prisoners in Changi and on various \"unalive\" marches.\n\nI mean, they were killed in action, it's pretty clear, and then they were either worked to death or straight up executed.\n\nI mean, it's History, it's a known fact, why use soft language? Are we trying to look at history with rose coloured glasses?\n\nWhat is gained by making history soft? I mean, history was always brutal and cruel. I mean, it's happened, it happened the way it did. People were killed, murdered, assassinated, tortured, executed, and more.\n\nAnd there's nuances in those terms, Franz Ferdinand being unalived was very different to Jack the Ripper unaliving his victims, there was absolutely different endgames between assassination and murders.\n\nThe \"unaliving\" of the Allied prisoners in Singapore was very different to when they \"unalived\" Jewish prisoners in Europe.\n\nI mean, to me it seems like we're trying to make it seem \"yeah it's fine\" when we talk about how they \"unalived the Jews\"\n\nWhat is there to be gained by dancing around the holocaust? Making it sound softer than it actually is?\n\nTo me, things like this should get spoken about as they were, in the brutal terms they existed in.\n\nOr is this another example of [soft language that George Carlin spoke about](https://youtu.be/o25I2fzFGoY)?

We welcome questions from people of all backgrounds and levels of experience in linguistics.\n\nThis is our weekly Q&amp;A post, which is posted every Monday. We ask that certain types of questions be asked here instead of in a separate post.\n\n**Questions that should be posted in the Q&amp;A thread:**\n\n* Beginner questions — if you’re looking for a general answer that can be found in an introductory textbook, then it probably belongs here. If you ask in a separate post we’ll ask you to move it here.\n\n* Questions that can be answered with a simple Google or Wikipedia search — you should try Google and Wikipedia first, but we know it’s sometimes hard to find the right search terms or evaluate the quality of the results. Instead of removing these questions, we just ask you post them here.\n\n* Asking why someone (yourself, a celebrity, etc.) has a certain language feature — unless it’s a well-known dialectal feature, we can usually only provide very general answers to this type of question. And if it’s a well-known dialectal feature, it still belongs here.\n\n* Requests for transcription or identification of a feature — remember to link to audio examples.\n\n* English dialect identification requests — for language identification requests and translations, you want r/translator. If you need more specific information about which English dialect someone is speaking, you can ask it here.\n\n* Questions about prescriptivism — such as whether it's good or bad, when it's appropriate, whether something \"counts\" as prescriptivism, etc. These questions usually need the same general answers clarifying the role of descriptivism/prescriptivism in linguistics, so please post them here.\n\nWe’ll ask you to move your post to the Q&amp;A thread if you post it on the front page and we think it fits one of the above categories. You’re free to post your question here.\n\nIf you post your question to the Q&amp;A thread and don’t get an answer by the end of the week, you can post it as a separate post. If it’s already the weekend, you might want to wait to post your question until the new Q&amp;A post goes up on Monday.\n\n**Discouraged Questions**\n\nThese types of questions are subject to removal:\n\n* Asking for answers to homework problems. If you’re not sure how to do a problem, ask about the concepts and methods that are giving you trouble. Avoid posting the actual problem if you can.\n\n* Asking for paper topics. We can make specific suggestions once you’ve decided on a topic and have begun your research, but we won’t come up with a paper topic or start your research for you.\n\n* Asking for grammaticality judgments and usage advice — basically, these are questions that should be directed to speakers of the language rather than to linguists.\n\n* Questions that are covered in our FAQ or reading list — follow-up questions are welcome, but please check them first before asking how people sing in tonal languages or what you should read first in linguistics.",

        "text": "I was only six years old when I first became interested in the realm of linguistics; though, at the time, it intrigued me for drastically different reasons than the reasons it does today. As a kid linguistics meant getting to skip class with some lady every couple of days, teaching me to say my “R’s” while playing a few board games like “Candyland” and “Snakes and Ladders” to somehow incite me to roll my tongue better, I guess. Today, as a second-year university student hoping to eventually obtain a Master of Science in Speech Language Pathology, language has begun to fascinate me in more ways than I can imagine, and with every class I take it seems to further emphasize this idea of mine. \n\nWith this fascination however, I have also come to the realization that there is surprisingly a large amount of politics that go into linguistics as well, especially regarding woman who do not receive enough credit for their incredulous work on languages around the world. One case in particular that I came across was the work of Alice Kober’s on Linear B, which, for those who do not know, was the previously undeciphered writing system that was used throughout the late Bronze age in Greece (Skelton 50). If even mentioned, Kober is typically portrayed as someone who set the “real decipherers” on the right track, instead of being recognized as who she truly was; a key component who made the decipherment in the early 1950’s possible.\n\nWhen I was tasked with researching Linear B for my English class, the first results that popped up on Google was that the decryption of Linear B is all thanks to a man named Michael Ventris. The more I read, the popular narratives depicted Ventris meeting the original discoverer of Linear B by pure chance as a schoolboy, and from there his curiosity grew. This curiosity then combined with his pure genius, which ultimately allowed him to “single-handledly decipher the script” into what we know of it today (Cracking the code: the decipherment of Linear B 60 years on). Most articles and websites do state that he built off the work of previous scholars, and Ventris did acknowledge Kober’s work in the decrypting of the script, but her name was forgotten and overshadowed by men; an issue that our world seemingly has been dealing with since the beginning of time, especially regarding science and discovery throughout history. Like, for example, Lise Meitner who helped discover protactinium, the radioactive element, but was left off scientific papers for being a woman and because she was Jewish (Women in Radiation History: Lise Meitner). Even today if you search up “protactinium discovery,” the credit is mainly given to only men, which unfortunately is a fact that is all too familiar in Alice Kober's situation, too.\n\nSo, you might be wondering, if Kober really impacted the Linear B’s decipherment so much, how come she never spoke up about her involvement herself? Well, even though Kober “came within a hairs breadth of deciphering the script,” she unfortunately had an “untimely death in 1950” as it was just three years before the decipherment was officially figured out (Fox 11). Of the 622 pages of “Documents in Mycenaean Greek” by Micheal Ventris and John Chadwick, the eight pages that mention Kober’s work explain that she discovered that Linear B tablets had “grammatical inflections” throughout them, including passive participles, masculine and feminine functions, conjunctions, and even plural/dual endings at the end of phrases (15). Another one of her crucial contributions was her development of “The Grid” which suggested a “tentative phonetic pattern” (16), or, in other words, instead of using letters to create words like we do in English, the Linear B symbols represented *syllables*, or groups of sounds essentially. This conclusion along with her grammatical contributions and the original development of “The Grid,” helped Ventris use process of elimination after Kober’s passing to further decipher this “Grid,” and, combined with the help of Linguist John Chadwick, we came to know the decipherment that we have today (the images at the end show Kober's initial \"Grid\" in comparison to Ventris' first \"Grid,\" where you can see the similarities between their structure). \n\nNow I want to be clear that I am not trying to diminish the work that Ventris and Chadwick contributed to Linear B, as their contributions were obviously vital as well; however, I just feel that more people need to know how important Kober was on this project too. One of the books that I have actually been using as a reference throughout this post was written by Margalit Fox in 2013, *The Riddle of the Labyrinth: The Quest to Crack an Ancient Code,* and from what I have researched, Fox is one of the first people to truly analyze Kober’s work in Linear B, which finally brought Kober’s contributions into the light and highlighted some of the struggles Kober faced as a female professor and researcher when stereotypical gender roles were still very prevalent. We are still experiencing the repercussions of these stereotypes today, and thankfully with the use of social media we are finally able to learn about some of these female researchers who are long overdue for a proper acknowledgment, but nevertheless, it also leaves me wondering whether other discoveries that are primarily credited to men, were actually majorly influenced by unknown women, too. \n\n[Alice Kober's initial \\\\\"Grid\\\\\" \\(Fox 162\\)](https://preview.redd.it/aqptxtg3r4fa1.jpg?width=610&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1c08e874d01a5a8818221ccfd25b22b4db68d629)\n\n[Michael Ventris' first \\\\\"Grid\\\\\" \\(Fox, 164\\)](https://preview.redd.it/jewqaz6zq4fa1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12cb6ab3645281d4f649b8cef7e30a41c27ff884)\n\n# Works Cited\n\n“Cracking the Code: The Decipherment of Linear B 60 Years On.” *University of Cambridge*, University of Cambridge, 13 Oct. 2012, https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/cracking-the-code-the-decipherment-of-linear-b-60-years-on. \n\nFox, Margalit. *The Riddle of the Labyrinth: The Quest to Crack an Ancient Code*.

        "text": "Hi all!\n\nI think this question is kind of basic for many of you. But I think it is something that I have only came to realize the more I study French.\n\nLet's take some examples with indirect object of French and English:\n\nI send you a letter\n\nHere, a letter is direct object, and you is an indirect object.\n\nI can rewrite it in this form and it is clearer\n\nI send a letter to you\n\nNow, with the preposition \"you\", it is clearer that \"you\" is an indirect object because the preposition marks it.\n\nIn French, it is also:\n\nJe vous donne une lettre or Je donne une lettre à vous.\n\nSo both languages agree with each other. \n\nBut I am thinking of an even simpler example like this:\n\nI am think about this story today (Here, despite the presence of \"of\", \"this book\" is a direct object of the verb \"think\")\n\nYou lie to your girls (Here, despite \"to\", \"your girls\" is a direct object of the verb \"lie\")\n\nBut in French, it is defined differently!\n\nAujour d'hui, Je pense à cette histoire (Here \"cette histoire\" is actually an indirect object, because of an à\", or in French grammar, an indirect object complement)\n\nVous manquez à votre filles (Here \"votre filles\" is an indirect object, because of \"à\")\n\nSo, the presence of a preposition is an criteria for classifying the property \"direct\" or \"indirect\" of an object. I have checked this website:[https://www.scribbr.fr/elements-linguistiques/coi-complement-dobjet-indirect/](https://www.scribbr.fr/elements-linguistiques/coi-complement-dobjet-indirect/) and it states that the presence of a preposition is the criteria for identifying an indirect object (or indirect object complement). Bescherelle Grammaire states one of the criteria is \"se construit avec une préposition). Before that, it states \"On peut identifier COI sans faire appel au sens\" (We can identify indirect object complement without **recoursing to meaning**). \n\nAnd I think a bit deeper about it, it makes sense. In French grammar, there are classes of words that depend entirely on whether the object follows a preposition. Think of 2 pronouns \"y\" and \"en\", or a whole class of relative pronouns such as \"dont\", \"lequel\". Of course, they replace only unanimated objects, not animated.\n\nSo my observation points to a tentative conclusion that in French, an indirect object (or indirect object complement) is marked solely from a grammatical perspective, not based on meaning. In English, what are French indirect object will be direct object. The principal marker of an indirect object in French is the presence of prepositions.\n\nIs this the right observation? A counter-argument that nullifies my observation's validity is that the presence of a preposition in English is just a construction. Some verbs are followed by one or many prepositions which indicate a specific meaning.",

The example she gave was as a response to someone historically anti-gun buying a gun.\n\nIt *seems* kind of subjunctive to me, in a superficial semantic sense, though Croatian (and presumably its sibling dialects) is said to lack a subjunctive *proper*/morphological. Maybe it's just subjunctive in meaning, without being *grammatically* subjunctive? This said, it doesn't really carry the meaning usually associated with subjunctivity. \n\nI *feel* like I've seen similar constructions in English, but can't think of any perfect examples. It seems kind of similar to the seemingly optative construction in 'would that I live a long life', and a (fairly) literal translation of the phrase 'da i to doživim', 'that I would experience that,' does seem to work in English.\n\nI did try to consult the literature, but it wasn't clear exactly how to look it up.",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I am a Middle and Secondary Education/French major (with Spanish and linguistics minors) at university, but I am majorly interested in teaching French at the university level (with research pertaining to SLA, language pedagogy, etc.). I created a model of SLA based on my own experiences as a language learner, and during my Ph.D., I want to support this with data from a classroom study. Teaching high school for a few years before pursuing this will give some \"informal\" ideas on how to tweak the model. But it seems like a Ph.D. in SLA or SLS would be the most ideal context for doing such research, right?\n\nI had a linguistics professor at one point that recommended against a Ph.D. in SLA. They said that there is a lack of job opportunities for those in SLA (besides teaching ESL) and that it would be better to do a Ph.D. in linguistics. I know that I'd particularly enjoy a Ph.D. in SLA more.\n\nSo, Linguistics Reddit, if my goal is to be a French professor but research the idea explained above, should I do a Ph.D. in French Linguistics or a Ph.D. in SLA? It seems to be a toss up between my desired, long-term career and the research idea, although they are related.",

        "text": "I have been thinking on the importance of aesthetics. This came to be because one of the main arguments against a spelling reform of English is that closer-to-phonetical attempts most often result in very ugly spellings. The IPA itself is exceedingly ugly which makes me wonder how did it caught on (I will also apreciate comments on this). \n\n(Another main argument is that it would require a different spelling for each dialect, I think the solution to that is to consider that basically everyone is widely exposed to Received Pronunciation and like it or not it is the standard)\n\nSimilar arguments are often conjured in other fields such as the problem with alternative musical notations, bad/unclear notation in maths and physics, etc.\n\nI realize aesthetic values vary widely widely across cultures and fields, there will probably never be a \"universal solution\" but there must be specific developments going on (again, comments on such are highly appreciated).",
