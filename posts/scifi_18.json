To pass the time, I've started running through SF movies on Netflix and Prime Video.\n\nTo date, I have watched 2:22, Samaritan, Titan, Coherence, Parallel, The Adam Project and today was Alpha Gateway.\n\nAlpha Gateway is more or less the same premise as Parallel and Coherence.  Oh and it's British - really, really British - cars on the left side of the road, tea, all that fun stuff.  A scientist discovers how to travel between parallel universes and mayhem ensues.  I liked it fine for what it was but there's almost no special effects.\n\nAny recommendations for tomorrow?  I have most of the major streaming services - Prime/Netflix/HBOMax/Paramount+/Peacock/Disney+/Hulu.  As I said in another thread, I've seen all the big stuff so if it's been released to theaters in any kind of wide release, I've probably seen it.  Really prefer scifi with one or more of \"Spaceships, Lasers, Robots\".",

It doesn't show in my history (may not be available through the service any more), and doesn't show up in my emails as a \"purchase\" invoice. I don't remember the author, or even a single name of one of the (at least) 14 books in the series, so I'll list what I have, and if y'all are able to work this miracle, it'll make me extremely happy.\n- The series is actually two separate sets, one occurring around now-ish, and the other a couple of thousand years later\n- set 1: aliens send a virus to earth that kills 99.9% of the population. The first book is primarily the aftermath, with very little alien involvement. After that it's an insurgency scenario.\n- One of the characters is a hydroponics nerd, living in rural Montana (I think)\n- One of the characters visits Steinbeck's house as he's roaming the country, trying to find a way to defeat the aliens\n- One of the characters is a yound girl that eventually kinda becomes a ninja. There's a showdown in a mansion in the San Diego area. She eventually sets up a base on Catalina, off the coast of LA, and narrowly avoids assassination by cianide in beer.\n\n- Set 2: Starts with an asteroid mining ship that discovers an alien vessel burring in the ice.\n- That ship was part of a race of friendly aliens that have been trying to aid humanity against a hostile race that lurks outside the oort cloud\n- Eventually there's a huge space battle (not super helpful, I know)\n\nThere are more bits and pieces that I remember, but I read about 100 books in 6 months during the time period, so things are fuzzy.\n\nTldr: I think I'm going insane, and hope to enlist the help of The Internet, or at least Reddit as I search for a sci-fi series.",

        "text": "It's often misused a lot Star Trek is often called \"raypunk\" or \"atompunk\", but it's more \"rayprep\" or \"atomprep\". The big difference in anything -punk is the status quo is undesirable and our protagonists are challenging the status quo and -prep is about the status quo being desirable and it gets challenged by antagonistic parties.\n\n\nThere's not a lot of new -prep and I kinda need that in my life experience of an undesirable status quo and I want to see a future of a status quo worth protecting and bonus points if you can see where bot factions are coming from.\n\n\nWhat I liked about Star Wars was it was about the recently eroded desirable status quo being resurrected and challenging the new status quo that replaced it. So it feels punk and prep. Like 75% punk and 25% prep.",

I also notice the more i watch the scenes on YouTube the more sounds or things i notice that i didn't notice before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing video 9atrn6ecpdfa1...*",
