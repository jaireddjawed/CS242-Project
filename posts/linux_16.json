China also wants to replace over 50 million computers with Linux. So i wonder, how popular is linux in China? So i did a ddg search and didn't find much of use. I even went to a Chinese youtube like site called bilibili. And after all my privacy disappeared faster than the prote- anyways, i didnt find anything useful there either. I did a search on searx for Chinese computers with linux. And huwawei is selling laptops with deepin in Chia, which is pretty neat. But how popular is linux in china? How many know about it there? How many devices come with linux preinstalled? So many questions.",

        "author": "SaxonyFarmer",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/10x8x13/incron_not_starting_script/",
        "text": "I upload a file from a bike computer to my PC via Dropbox (bike computer-&gt;Dropbox-&gt;my PC) and want to start a Python program when this happens. Today, I have a CRON entry that runs every 5 minutes looking for a file but I want this process to be triggered when the file is uploaded.\n\nI have installed INCRON and defined an event table to test that this will work when a file is uploaded. The event table for this test (and for my experience):\n\n    \t/home/dave/Dropbox/apps/WahooFitness/   IN_CLOSE_WRITE   /bin/bash /home/dave/Scripts/WahooFileFound.sh $#\n    \t/home/dave/Dropbox/Test/        IN_CLOSE_WRITE   /bin/bash /home/dave/Scripts/TestFileFound.sh $#\n\nThe first line of the 'incrontab' is for a file to be uploaded from my bike computer.  The second is simply a test since I ride only once a day.  Once I am confident this test will work, I will schedule a Python program to run when the real bike computer file is uploaded.\n\nI can see that the event is triggered when I create a new file in the folder:\n\n    \tFeb 02 15:27:16 davesdesktop incrond[561422]: PATH (/home/dave/Dropbox/Test/) FILE (TestFileFound.txt) EVENT (IN_CLOSE_WRITE)\n    \tFeb 02 15:27:16 davesdesktop incrond[561422]: (dave) CMD (/home/dave/Scripts/TestFileFound.sh TestFileFound.txt)\n\nINCRON says the script is started but it does not execute. If I run the script from the command line, it works as expected, producing the file in /tmp and sending the email. The script:\n\n    \t#!/bin/bash\n    \tset -eu\n    \t# Original:   V1\n    \techo \"From TestFileFound.sh: Test File '$1' from '$HOME/Dropbox/Test' was found!!!!\" &gt; /tmp/TestFileFound_Message.txt \n    \t# Send email \n    \tEMAIL=\"&lt;my email address&gt;\" \n    \tSUBJ=\"Test File from '$HOME/Dropbox/Test' was found!!!!\"\n    \tmail -s \"$SUBJ\" \"$EMAIL\" &lt; /tmp/TestFileFound.txt\n    \texit\n    \n    It is marked executable:\n    \n    \t[15:20:30 ~]$ ls -l Scripts/Test*.sh\n    \t-rwxrwxr-x 1 dave dave 312 Feb  2 15:22 Scripts/TestFileFound.\n\nI do not see the file created by the 'echo' message in the /tmp folder nor do I see any emails when this script is triggered by the INCRON event. \n\nI have various scripts and Python programs scheduled by my user CRON that successfully create emails to notify me when they have completed and I see those emails in my GMAIL inbox.\n\nWhat have I not done or done incorrectly that this script is not running when triggered by INCRON?\n\nThanks ahead of time for any solutions or suggestions you can offer.\n\nDave",

        "text": "Quick background:  Lab environment with a RHEL 5 system that has almost nothing installed on it - proprietary setup for a very...very old system.  Former administrator had built a samba share that allowed a local user to move files off of RHEL to a share on the windows domain.  System \"works\" until this last week when the network time/date were all skewed...\n\nNow even after a resync to prevent drift, the RHEL generates a mount.cifs 113 error on boot and anytime I try to use the samba share one of two things happen:\n\nA) Error trying to connect, timeout.\nB) Able to see the shares, and I'm able to move data FROM windows to the RHEL, but seemingly no permissions to write or move data.\n\n/etc/fstab shows the mnt shares but it doesn't have a credentials file to reference.  So I tried to manually smb through the system using smb://&lt;domainuser@ipaddress/share&gt;    This brings up a credential window, now I THINK I'm putting in the syntax correctly but maybe i'm not here.  The system autop-opulates but when I put in my password it doesn't accept it.  I'm much more comfortable in windows than linux so it's possible I'm messing this up, but I wasn't able to find much on the credential window.  Is the system name (windows here) supposed to be a FQDN format?  Do I continue to use forward slash instead of backslash for windows nomenclature?\n\nI've also pulled up the man doc for Mount.Cifs and it looks like I could specify the username/password for the windows domain but when I attempt to run it, it says mount.cifs doesn't exist.  \n\nTroubleshooting steps:  Inspected IPs, checked services on both linux and windows, checked if the port was listening on windows, able to SSH from windows into linux (can't SCP across though), recreated a new smb share and verified same issues, verified account on windows domain wasn't locked out.",

I've looked at several sources and this seems to be the safest way to dual boot on a laptop. Is there any helpful sources that any of you can provide so that I don't overlook anything (e.g., I wanted to see if there was a way to not allow windows to even know the presence of another ssd so there is minimal chance for any overwriting). I am a novice in this feel and would appreciate any insights on continuing with this setup.",

The official one had some issues with memory leaks that would always end up freezing my main laptop, and the UI wasn't quite how I wanted it to be.\n\nThis ended up with my wanting to develop a new GTK client for my needs, which was originally just going to be for WebDAV servers, but then I remembered about rclone and how it can connect to pretty much any storage provider out there. From that point I changed gears to making the application work with more cloud providers, thus getting to current state of Celeste.\n\nCurrently Celeste can connect to Dropbox, Google Drive, Nextcloud, ownCloud, and generic WebDAV servers. More storage types are also planned for the future, including Microsoft OneDrive and Amazon S3.\n\nIf you have any questions about the project or just want to leave some feedback, feel free to leave them in the comments below or on the project's GitHub page linked at the top :).",
