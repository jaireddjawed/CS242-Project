It also focus more on a grand narrative of things not writting biographies per se but including anecdotes about individuals lives in the narrative (best seen in Herodotus, who mixes biographical details, histories of specific empires and peoples and geography). And when we get to a more modern period, say the reign of Henry 4 (that took place at the same time as the Ming) if one want to write about him there are only two primary sources one could use (at least those I found on Wikipedia) : Jules Berger de Xivrey *Recueil des lettres missives de Henri IV*, Pierre de L'Estoile, *Registre-journal du règne de Henri IV.* How much should an historian trust them when writing a biography of the King ?\n\nSo to rephrase my question : How did Chinese handle having to write history without reliable and easy sources when they weren't used to work like this ?\n\nI'm sure they know how nowadays but how did they do at the beginning and what did they think of western history recording tradition?",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I am no scholar of Shakespeare and haven't the slightest idea about his personal track record with historical accuracy, ergo this question. Sorry if it's a bit silly.\n\nI recently finished reading *Hamlet* and couldn't help but wonder why Denmark's rival in the play was made to be Norway, which at the time of writing would have a) posed little to no military threat and b) been in personal union with Denmark. Sweden, on the other hand, had recently broken out of the Kalmar Union and had already been engaged in multiple skirmishes with Denmark-Norway since then (the Northern Seven Years' War, for one, would've taken place just a few years prior to the composition of *Hamlet*). Also, since the royal residence in *Hamlet* is said to be the lavish Elsinore/Kronberg, which was first constructed as late as the 15th century and would've been quite well known among Shakespear's contemporaries, I can only assume the events depicted took place after that, by which point there would've been little factual basis for making *Norway*, a kingdom which by then had ceased to exist as an independent entity, the main threat to Hamlet's kingdom. Hell, even Lübeck would have made a better choice.\n\nSo my question is: was this decision more likely to have been the result of pure artistic licence on the Bard's part, or a product of genuine ignorance? What are the chances that Shakespeare and his contemporaries simply did not know all that much about historical and ongoing political affairs in Scandinavia? And most importantly, did Shakespeare even intend for *Hamlet* to be set in his own time, or is it meant to invoke earlier periods, like the 13th century of Saxo Grammaticus' Amleth?",

My God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant!\"\n\nThus tells Nikolai Rostov to himself in Chapter 54 of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace as Tsar Alexander I, Emperor of Russia, reviews the Austrian and Russian troops. Nikolai (and seemingly the entire army) practically foams at the mouth at the sight of his sovereign. This begs the question: how well-known, well-liked, and venerated were the emperors and other heads of state by the common people at the time? \n\nWhile Nikolai Rostov is presented as noble-born and educated and thus not your average citizen of the Russian Empire, and is characterized in the novel as a hot-headed, emotional, and patriotic youth, Tolstoy gives the impression that the entire army acts and feels the same way. Would Nikolai's unadulterated love for his Emperor be normal for the time? Is this just story-telling, or perhaps unique to Russia? Tolstoy makes sure to have his Russian characters poke fun at the Austrians, and while Holy Roman Emperor Francis II is also present in this scene, we are not given a sense of the reaction of the troops (either Russian or Austrian) to him. Would the average person in the Holy Roman Empire be expected to similarly venerate Francis II?\n\nFurther, while the troops are expecting the emperor's appearance, we are told that Nikolai 'with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar.\" Nikolai claims to recognize Alexander by sight, while certainly having never seen him in person before. Would normal citizens of Russia (both Nobles and otherwise), and the other states of Europe in the 1800s be familiar with what their leaders looked like?\n\nA couple other questions arise here: Is this all storytelling? Is this just how the soldiers of their time would have reacted to their leaders? Were \"normal\" people of these nations really so patriotic at the time? Was love of King and Country really that powerful of a recruitment aid for armies in the 1800s? Or even pre-1800s?",

What is the reason for this when they both seem to be such powerful forces in the makeup of Irish political and personal identity to this day?",

        "text": "So I read \"The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu, 1862-1868\" by Totman (this is in regards to the example from xx/xxi, and the rise of court power is something I've been thinking about in general). I've been wondering: How did the court regain political influence? I'm aware that they gave some legitimacy to the bakufu regime and were therefore kept somewhat afloat but I don't know where they drew their power from. AFAIK they did not hold land and didn't have had a medium-size han to administer and draw taxes from (Correction: Apparently the house holdings were 141,151 koku in 1698 - Source: The Cambridge History of Japan, Volume 4, Early Modern Japan p. 152). The emperor hadn't been a real ruler for centuries and the court sometimes even had to starve.\n\nAnd the book mentioned the court exerting pressure on the bakufu and trying to force it into subordination without any explanation as to 1) how it worked, and 2) why the court thought it'd work.\n\nThe only thing I'm aware of is, that after Hotta Masayoshi's predecessor Abe Masahiro's death, who was far more adept at political maneuvering, Hotta had to take over as Rōjū shuseki - chief councilor. He then was hard-pressed when Townsend Harris arrived and demanded privileges of travel and residence, which was sharply opposed, but he acquiesced in 1857. In 1858 he tried and failed, to secure court approval of the treaty (why did he want court approval?), which supposedly was the reignition of the court's political activity and led to the loss of faith in him.\n\nWhy did he try to get court approval? - Were children thought to respect the court or something? I'm honestly just very confused.",

If we start from societies of antiquity such as Rome and Greece, people appeared to take the presence of slavery completely for granted-it was simply what happened when a person was taken prisoner in war or came into a great deal of debt. I at least am not aware of any arguments against slavery from this era.\n\nMoving into the middle and medieval ages, we begin to see something like a conditional approach to anti-slavery arise, were Christians and Muslims ought not to enslave fellow members of their faith, but others were fair game. At some point this develops into the idea that no one ought to be a slave, but i'm curious if we can roughly pinpoint when exactly this idea begins to hold. Is there a particular thinker or individual we can credit with developing against the institution of slavery as a whole, or was it a very gradual movement fueled by various factors?",

        "text": "I am working on putting together a class on Oklahoma history and have gone down a rabbit while in dugout homes. My question is did these settlers have any plans or guides for building these? Was there a manual or a pamphlet of some kind with tips for people moving out onto the plains? Or did they all take construction into their own hands? If everyone was building without plans how did construction methods like dugouts and sod houses become so widespread?",
