They still operate like they did in 2003 getting most movies and shows that get a physical release. If you are patient then it's a great option. I am on a 2 disc plan from Gamefly (they also offer 4K Blu Rays which Netflix doesn't) and for things like shows you get 3-5 episodes per disc.\n\nOn demand content can be supplemented by any number of free with ad services like Freevee.",

        "text": "I replaced my shoes since mine have been run down. It's been a long time. I noticed the other day at the gym that my treads were basically worn flat, not to mention the hole forming by my big toe. Still, considering that I walk up to five or six miles every day and do other stuff, too, my Brooks shoes have lasted me the longest and have especially been the most comfortable out of any of them I've tried. They're pricey, but they have some decent pairs under $100 if you look around Amazon for a few minutes. My mom got them for me as a Christmas gift one year, and I have been walking around in them ever since. As an active person, good shoes are a must. After spending most of my life shopping at Payless or Walmart or similar for shoes, stepping into a pair of shoes that actually supported me felt amazing, and I never want to go back. Speaking about the future of my joints, avoiding surgery and pain further on down the line if at all possible would be ideal.\n\nI ordered a stainless steel water bottle since I didn't have one for the gym. I also got a bottle of 180 multivitamins with extra biotin ($24 -- vitamins are expensive! But it's hard to get all the nutrients one needs from diet alone), 1000mg x 240 capsules MSM (methylsulfonylmethane - $14) for my shoulder that likes to slide out of the socket sometimes (and hasn't for about 9 months now -- so I might not need surgery, thankfully), 125mcg x 60 vitamin D3 ($5), and 6000mg x 200 gingko biloba ($15) supplements ($15), along with some rose quartz and charcoal facial cleanser ($7). All of these are to further support my healthy journey. I know it sounds like a good little bit, but I purchased what I needed to in order to be happy and continue working on improving my physical and mental health. This\n\nMore \"frivolous\" purchases included more headwraps along with a new necklace. I buy new headwraps at least once a year, and this felt like the right time, so I found a pack of six for $16. I feel my personality has changed since I bought the necklace I used to wear. I took the old one off one day and never felt like clipping it back on since it has some deep emotional attachments tied to it, but I missed the sensation of wearing one, so I found one of a different style for $13. My mirror broke sometime last year, so I finally got a new one for my dancing so I can watch myself in real time, which was $8, and an $8 power bank for my phone seemed necessary or at least cheaper than replacing the whole phone because it can't hold a charge while I'm out all day.\n\nAnyway, that's my thoughts on online shopping. Selecting about 15 items in total took me a good few hours today because I will sift through the multitudes of products, looking at reviews and comparisons until I am absolutely certain I wish to spend that money. Usually when I open the shopping app, I end up closing it again, so I'm happy and thankful today that I was able to get some of the things I need to be healthy and happy.",

Every time I make a call, the LTE that I have disappears and I lose service. I have been in contact with Mint throughout this time and have tried the following:\n\n1. Network reset (on my end) multiple times\n2. Network reset (on Mint's end)\n3. Setting up APN to Mint's suggested settings.\n\nWith each of these steps, I have several days of service before once again losing the ability to make or receive calls. One of the most annoying things about this is that there is no indication that my service is lost, as I lose it immediately upon trying to make a call - I CAN'T EVEN TELL IF MY PHONE IS NOT WORKING AND I HAVE LOST CLIENTS BECAUSE OF THIS.\n\nAt this point, I am looking for anything/anyone that can help and would suggest that ALL PIXEL USERS AVOID MINT MOBILE.

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am new here, but wanted to share what I believe to be my best financial tip. It has been posted here before in years past, but it can serve as a good reminder. \n\nAs a disclaimer, this is not medical advice and please speak to a professional before taking any supplement. \n\nWhen looking at my bank statements over the last few months, I’ve noticed that many charges are coming from gas stations. I’ve realized this is because I have a habit of going and getting a Monster Absolute Zero in the afternoon. \n\nAlong with this, I find it easy to also grab a protein bar while I am in there. Those $7-$13 trips really add up, and I decided to make a change. I have purchased cases in the past, but even then you aren’t getting the cans for that much cheaper. By switching to caffeine pills, I will no joke save thousands of dollars this year. Here is the math to demonstrate:\n\nMonster Zero caffeine per can: 160 mg\n\nNutricost caffeine per capsule: 200 mg\n\nMonster Zero bulk cost per unit: $1.52\n\nNutricost caffeine capsules per unit: $0.06.\n\nOne bottle of Nutricost caffeine capsules contains 50,000 mg of caffeine. To get the same amount of caffeine in Monster zero, you would have to purchase roughly 313 cans. \n\nNutricost 200 mg caffeine capsules 250 count: $13.95 with Prime.\n\n313 cans of Monster Zero at $1.52/unit: $475.76.\n\nNow, I understand Monster Zero is a more well rounded product that has an energy blend. However, I have found that caffeine alone can give you the same effects desired from the Monster. \n\nI love Monster Zero, but I am also getting more cautious about what I am putting in my body. I feel more comfortable taking pure caffeine and drinking carbonated water than researching the effects of the long list of ingredients Monster has. \n\nAnother benefit is knowing the exact amount of caffeine I’m consuming. Coffee and tea drinkers can sometimes lose track of how much they consume. This can lead to jitteriness and anxiety. With a pill, I can control the exact amount I take each day. \n\nAs an almost every day drinker of caffeine, I couldn’t believe the savings. I highly recommend trying this if you purchase retail caffeine products. If it’s not for you, you are only out $13.95.",

Unfortunately in the next 6 months or so, it’s going to need all new shocks and tires. Total comes to $3,000 rough estimate. \n\nI currently owe $9,000 on it due to rolling over money from my previous loan.  Yes I know this was a dumb choice , I’m new to this financial literacy thing.  Trade in value for it around here is about $6500.\n\nSo when i do have the money saved up for it ( I’m putting money back for it, not something I want to use my credit card for) would it be smart to just say screw it and get it fixed and keep on trucking OR take that money and drop it onto the loan , hopefully break even on the trade in, and get an older well kept 4 cylinder for a smaller loan (6-7k range)",

That being said there are a lot of issues I can handle here but the one that is driving me nuts is the fact that they have one tenant fridge and it's never colder than 47 degrees Fahrenheit. When I turn it down it can get down to 40- provided the temp in the room is cool enough - but they turn it down. In the summer it won't get down below 50.\n\nSo the issue is they pay for electricity and the rent is very low in a very high cost of living city.\n\nI would get a mini fridge but they didn't like when I had a small fan heater and asked me not to use it. \n\nDo I just suck it up for 550$ rent? (They might up it next month but 50$ due to electric costs going up like crazy either way). \n\nIt sucks not being able to keep anything in the fridge...but I'm not sure how much boat to rock here.",

        "text": "Pork shoulder and Boston Butt (upper shoulder) roasts are a cheap way to make pulled pork.\n\nI cook in a crock pot for 8-12 hours, you want the meat falling apart. I add about two cups of apple cider vinegar and water to cover. The meat is fatty and trying to cook in BBQ sauce is a mess.\n\nPull out chunks with a serving fork and salad fork onto a plate. Scrape off the fat and put the pulled pork into containers. I like pint sized translucent plastic containers. Then ladle out the liquid into two more pint sized containers. Put that all in the fridge. The remaining liquid is very fatty and not good for the drain. I let the crock pot cool and put it in the fridge.\n\nOnce those two pints of liquid have cooled, make a hole in the fat on the side of the container. Pour the liquid underneath into each of the pulled pork containers. Pour the rest of the liquid into the sink and put the solid fat in the trash. After the crock pot cools, scrape off the fat and toss. The remaining liquid can go down the drain.\n\nThe liquid is just packing liquid and doesn't have a lot of flavor. It does allow those containers to be frozen for at least a year. To use, thaw overnight, drain off the liquid and mix with BBQ sauce.\n\nI got a Boston Butt roast last week for $6.50, it made 4 pints of pulled pork.",

It cost less than $4 to make a pot of delicious aromatic chicken noodle soup that is 10 bowl servings (not a measly cup). That's less than 40 cents a serving, and has protein, carbs, and veggies. \n\nI've also been on a congee kick and have been turning leftover rice into a frugal version of this NYT recipe: [https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023629-butternut-squash-congee-with-chile-oil](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023629-butternut-squash-congee-with-chile-oil) \\- I always have frozen butternut squash, kombu, garlic, and stock, so it's a cinch to whip up. It costs me about $2 for 4-6 servings, depending on how much leftover rice I have from a dish. Even plain congee is hearty (and cheaper). \n\nHit me with your favorite soup ideas, please!",

I am certainly going to be in the market for a new car soon. I have spent the last few weeks doing some serious research on car prices in my area and cross shopping. \n\nAfter seeing the Toyota Corolla post currently on the front page, I am curious as to whether or not there is something I am missing. People are saying that purchase is dumb, used cars are dumb, they lose $10k/30% of value when you drive off the lot, etc etc.\n\nWhile I agree this may have been true pre-pandemic, this is absolutely NOT the case in my area. Used car prices are actually near identical if not MORE than the MSRP on a new vehicle, especially a Honda/Toyota.\n\nLet’s look at some examples:\n\nHere is the first Corolla I [found](https://www.edmunds.com/toyota/corolla/2022/vin/5YFEPMAE2NP322493/?radius=50). $23k for a 2022 with 12k miles.\n\nThis is higher than the MSRP on a new 2023 Corolla. Literally more for a used car than a new one. I have been to some local Toyota dealers (in the RI/MA area and I could get a new Corolla in the same base trim for juuuuust about MSRP, before taxes etc. Dealers were banking on the used car market staying insane and are now absolutely refusing to take a loss on vehicles they overpaid for. \n\nMy question is this, and it is an honest one: why give that guy such a hard time? Am I missing something? As I am seriously in the car market I will take all advice and if I am being a dumbass I can accept that. I just don’t know if any commenters on that post were aware of the reality of the used car market.\n\nJust so this post stays up, I can pose a more general question: What the hell do you do if you need to buy a car in 2023?\n\nLook forward to any input and discussion.",
