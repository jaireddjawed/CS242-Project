I know that most British viewers pay for the license but i'll be travelling there and only be staying a few months.  I've heard good things about Wild Isles and it's one of the shows I'd like to catch while I'm there. Is it something I have to ask about regarding my rental lease or are all  residents obliged to purchase the license?  Any help on this matter is much appreciated.",

I found them to be pretty boring. The season did start to become somewhat enjoyable and solid starting from Ep. 6 or 7 to me, but it was still boring at times.\n\nThe last 2 episodes of the season were pretty good, and a couple more from Ep. 6 or 7 onwards were pretty solid too, but I wish there was just overall more drama and excitement. \n\nThe Wire S1‚Äôs and Better Call Saul S1‚Äôs 1st halves were both slow paced, but they still had some enjoyable stuff going on to keep us engaged while they were building to the 2nd half. Mad Men‚Äôs 1st season didn‚Äôt really do that: it was just boring most of the time and didn‚Äôt really build to much or have a main plotline.\n\nIs the show going to be like this the entire way through where it is boring a lot of the time and sometimes decent without much of a main plotline? Or is the show‚Äôs 1st season similar to that of other well-regarded shows, like The Sopranos, BoJack Horseman, etc., where the 1st season isn‚Äôt that crazy, but it finds its footing with succeeding seasons?",

        "text": "Lasso had 71 on metacritic in season 1, 85 on season 2 and is back down to 72 in season 3.\n\nDoes that jump from season 1 to 2 make any sense? No, while I think it's underrated personally, season 2 seems to polarize people more quality wise, season 1 having the best reviews would have made more sense. All that happened is Lasso became the hottest show in the world, and AppleTV started to get better reviews, so by the time of start of season 2 more critics jumped on the bandwagon, the start of season 2 reviews capture peak Lasso good will.\n\nThen midway through season 2, it became more popular online to criticize it and call it semi annoying. For this reason, Lasso season 3 was a stone cold LOCK to get worse reviews in season 3. This is where season 2 status being revised to \"above average, but kind of too much/annoying at times\" gets reflected. Because of confirmation bias if you go in expecting to see the half annoying Lasso you can see it. There is literally NOTHING they could have done quality wise in the first three episodes of season 3 to match that season 2 metacritic of 85. \n\nIn an ideal world this is not how things would work, why not just have a bunch of individuals with separate interesting opinions, instead of attached to this groupthink fads type of nonsense. These people are mentally weak collectivists who want everyone online to have the same opinions.",

Hopefully (and most likely) we see Doug continuing the show, while Rob can do novels and stuff like Big Finish productions (apparently both he and BF have shown interest in the past). Hopefully again, Rob may have some input again on the TV series.\n\nEither way, given how good a fair bit of series 11, 12 and TPL were, this is excellent news!",

        "text": "So many characters making dumb decisions that rely solely on plot convenience.\n\nMarienne and Nadia's plan was to fake Marienne's death while hoping that a serial killer who burnt up his ex-wife won't do anything to her body. What?\n\nJoe usually cuts up and/or buries bodies. He's a master at taking care of bodies. But guess what? He left her body on a bench so she'll be found as a junkie? What?\nHe could have cut her up. That was a dumb plan that only needs plot convenience to work.\nVery dumb plan coming from so-called smart characters. There was no valid reason for not calling the police on Joe. Is Joe superhuman? What would he do if he was arrested?\n\nApparently, even if by luck the plan worked, the killer who tracked her across the globe won't suspect for a second that she's alive?\n\nThis season had too many writing issues, forced plot twists etc...it's almost as if the writers wanted to add as many elements as possible in the show and drag it on further...\nI guess the numbers are good so Netflix won't let it end even when this season would have been a perfect time to end the show\n\nMy biggest issue is characters acting irrational. Yes most of the cast are junkies...it still doesn't cover up the random behavior of these characters. These characters feel like they're just there to occupy screentime.\n\nEven the police...wtf... It's crazy how they don't suspect Joe despite him being the most suspicious. \nSomeone was murdered in a resort with a killer on the loose almost burning 2 others alive, yet the police did nothing? They didn't even question or investigate the people there. Police didn't even ask questions about how TF they took care of the body. At least someone should have given statement about how Joe took the body downstairs or something. \nThe police didn't even question them? What?\n\nWhat about Joe? He has multiple personality disorder but how TF did he set the bunker he was in on fire with no way to escape. In fact if Kate hadn't come to save them, he'd be dead. There was no way he could have predicted she would even find where he was.\nTerrible writing there.\n\nI cannot forgive the character assassination of Joe. The explanation for why Joe murdered those people was beyond terrible. So Joe killed someone because she made a drunk and high remark around a table that \"people started dying the moment he appeared?\"\nWhat? No one even took her seriously.\n\nJoe throughout the past seasons has never been someone to kill so thoughtlessly. That's the reason he's survived for so long. He's smart. \n\nWhat was his other motives for the other murders? Someone he barely knew was taking advantage of his former staff and getting all the credit?\nWhat?\n\nIt's almost as if the writers don't even understand Joe's character. Character assassination right there.\n\nKate's father, Tim, he knew his daughter was dating someone who he suspected had previously killed his wife and yet he allowed him? And even blackmailed him to kill Rhys? What?\nFor someone that powerful, it makes no sense that he couldn't pay someone with no trace to him to do the job. It had to be someone he thought was an amateur?\nWhy would he even leave the daughter he was so protective of with Joe?\n\nDon't let me get started on the mess that Phoebe was.\n\nI heard the previous seasons were adapted from novels...but I won't be surprised if this season was not...it was probably just a season to milk the shows popularity.",

It was.!&lt;\n\n(Degree of Difficulty: Not particularly interested in the by-now standard YouTube Geek Culture Grift responses about \"nu-trek\" or whatever, as if I wanted those I could drink heavily and turn off the YouTube Comments Blocker add-on and just swim in Malding Nerd Froth pooping back and forth forever under any given RLM thumbnail.)\n\n**The Episode:** There's just legitimately great acting going on in here from multiple actors who are not only delivering *as* actors, but what they're being given feels completely in keeping with the characters as they've been presented to this point, and in context of their larger history in the show. \n\n**Also:** Frakes' direction isn't just impressive in terms of pacing, but blocking and camera movement was really, really well thought out. This is up there with his work on First Contact (which this season has been overtly referencing quite a bit) but I'd argue this is even tighter and more impressive than that? \n\n**AND**: I have a hard time believing Paramount *isn't* going to replace Discovery with a Picard-spinoff set on the Titan and starring Shaw, Seven, LaForge, and Jack Crusher as the primary leads. And based on this one episode, it would immediately become a must-watch on the level of Strange New Worlds. \n\nNow, I understand the inclination to weigh this by whether or not it justifies the two preceding seasons, or the decisions made on other shows by other creative teams, or to springboard into the aforementioned Geek Culture Talking Points about \"real trek\" and so on and so forth, but I really do think that - all that inevitable mess aside - as a solid hour of sci-fi storytelling, this was way, *way* up there. Just remarkable work by basically everyone. I loved watching it.",

Simpsons was as well, but Simpsons always had that cartoony vibe even when it was more down to earth - Homer jumping the gorge, for instance, and living.\n\nThe writing on King of the Hill was very strong, characters felt multilayered and complex, stories and characters felt down-to-earth and it was a show which I think could have worked as both an animated show and live-action.\n\nThe Simpsons in its peak years had many of the same qualities but I felt some of their stories (especially big social topics episodes like the gun episode or the one tackling immigration) didn‚Äôt have the same kind of nuance and sophistication that King of the Hill did.\n\nI like both shows so I don‚Äôt necessarily have a preference as far as better snow goes, but I think if someone said King of the Hill was slightly better, I couldn‚Äôt argue.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and do you prefer one over the other?",

He buys the big dumb tractor he doesn‚Äôt need because it‚Äôs the coolest one He plants a new type of crop every day, he buys sheep for a year, decides he‚Äôs bored with them, buys cows instead.  He opens shops and restaurants to give his fans a chance to be a part of the experience. Its all a lot of fun, and the sort of thing you can do when profitability isn‚Äôt not a concern because you have endless piles of Top Gear Grand Tour Millionaire money chilling out in a bank account. \n\nBut then there‚Äôs the other show. The ‚Äúoh No look how hard it is out here for farmers show‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI worked all year and I barely made any money!‚Äù ‚ÄúLook at all these endless forms I have to fill out! How am I supposed to protect my cows from TB if the mean old government won‚Äôt let me murder badgers?!‚Äù  And that show is just incompatible with the other show. Of course you didn‚Äôt make profits, you kept spending money on whatever new thing tickles your fancy today.  Of course the local town government is pissed at you, you invited 11 million twitter followers to this tiny town where the road isn‚Äôt even wide enough for two cars to pass each other.  Of course your cows are at risk of getting TB, everyone said ‚Äúhey this is a high TB if you get cows they‚Äôre probably gonna get it‚Äù and you said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs okay I want cows.‚Äù  And why oh why is he so insistent that his restaurant be on his farm?  Surely there is a restaurant in the town he could just purchase to sell his stuff directly to the people that wouldn‚Äôt require asking building permission for nine hundred fiddly little things?\n\nEither one of those shows on its own would be a fine show. But both at once makes it remarkably frustrating.  How can I be on his side against the council when he‚Äôs argues his farm needs to make a profit, despite the fact that I‚Äôve watched ten episodes where it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs not actually that concerned with making a profit?  Also, the more he whine about snowflakes and their doomsday climate change predictions, the harder it is for me to feel bad for him when he farm is struck by extreme never before seen weather patterns that risk it‚Äôs viability. Well dang man, why do YOU think you got hit by the most rain and then the largest drought ever if it‚Äôs not climate change?",
