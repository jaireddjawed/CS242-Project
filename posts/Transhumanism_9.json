        "text": "# What really is the merit in living?\n\nOne of the most important questions that must be asked when exploring this field is what is the inherent value of life? As so many posts in this thread discuss; the human definition of life, at least the non-medical one is utterly subjective and differs from person to person. Taking all of this into account I believe the discussion that is had again and again is really just why? You are perpetuating an existence for the sole purpose of continuing to perpetuate it and in such a future where a large percentage of humanity lives beyond previously imaginable scopes it can only be imagined that the population would be very tightly controlled. As this is the case and given that by most accounts the human existence is prolific in nature why is it that we will persist to live? I believe personally that if we are to look at a future where we will live for even more than 150 years we must look towards altering the basic nature of the human directive: reproduction. Carrying on with this point (keep in mind that this entire post is built around immortality produced by biological preservation and not cyber transcendentalism) would it truly be immortality any longer? The definition of immortality is as follows  \"the ability to live forever; eternal life.\" so it would seem that without evaluating what state of existence qualifies as life there will be no way in which to advance ourselves towards that goal.\n\nSimply put, before old man death is conquered it must be decided if whether or not the downfall of old man death truly is a key to endless life.\n\nWhat do you all believe is the definition of life beyond the biological?\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/50rh5sf682k11.jpg",

It would be like putting a programmed bot, into a physical bot , and calling it the same as the original body computer copy. I believe the human body computer light prism is amazing technology and should be extended as much as possible until we can find a way to transfer consciousness from flesh body to flesh body, (which can be done via astral projection and experienced body hosting experiments) I believe if we can find a way to scientifically  monitor multidimensionally and simultaneosly (physical and etheral)  a controlled astral projection host to host possession mission we could really get somewhere close to immortality .",

Let's say mind uploading has been successfully done, now what? If we managed to digitally upload our consciousness into the simulation, how would we know if it's going to be secured at all? Will there be a pass key or something before anyone can gain access to our digital minds?\n\nIn the blog entry, it said, *\"You might’ve successfully uploaded your mind into a bionic brain, but the data which is you could still be considered the property of whoever provided the software and hardware to make this a reality. And if you were to modify said bionic brain, or even use your own data however you see fit, that company could respond by crying out “theft” if what you’re doing is deemed contrary to their own interests.\"*\n\nSo this begs the question, how can we be sure about the security of our digital minds and will we even hold copyrights to it, or maybe a shared rights with the company who helped get us through the simulation?",

Over time it will undoubtedly improve as it’s exposed to more data.\n\nAs the tech evolves and once AI can evaluate gene mutations, run background checks on all of our ancestors, calculate personality traits that predispose people to early death (risk-taking, etc.) it could probably one day predict with some accuracy when our natural life will likely be over..Reminds me of the movie Big Fish.  \n\nWould you want to know? \n\nHopefully by this time there will also be ways to offset the predispositions and \"solve\" these issues through gene alteration, organ regeneration, and if all else fails, mind uploading.

A fellow influencer, Bermuda, deleted all of the 19-year-old’s posts, replacing some with pictures of herself. The reason for the hacking was simple: Bermuda was blackmailing Miquela into telling her more than one million followers the *truth*.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;People were outraged. “Leave her alone,” they commented. A few days later, Miquela did tell the truth. The truth is that Miquela is not real and neither is Bermuda. Both of them are creations produced by computer-generated imagery.\n\nThe way I see it, the whole attractiveness of having an 'idol' or someone to respect and look up to is because it gives us what we believe to be a worthy example of how to behave. We can also *relate* to them because they do have imperfections, just like us. They're still human. \n\nIf these celebrities are not human, I'm assuming they won't have the same ability to influence younger people because everyone will be aware that they're computer-generated.\n\n Or I could be completely wrong, a craze will come about and people's view of \"the perfect life\" will become almost unhealthy due to impossible-to-achieve standards. \n\nThoughts?",
