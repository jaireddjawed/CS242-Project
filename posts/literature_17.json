        "text": " \n\nSchool is fucking annoying. Everyday we do is basically,\n\n* Forced to wake every morning.\n* Forced to eat as fast as possible.\n* Wear dress and get prepared real quick.\n* Going to school and sit for 7 hours everyday, dealing with all those stupid drama and etc.\n* Come back and again do homework for the next 4 hours (depends on ur school)\n* Goto sleep and again wake up and repeat.\n\nNow these are my daily routines, who likes doing the **SAME** boring thing everyday? I feel like a robot when I do this and these make me seriously depressed. I feel like that my life has no value, I am doing a useless stuff every single day, everyday feels like a hell to me. Who don't get depressed going to sit in a prison for 7 hours everyday? It's obviously not good for our mental health. That's a reason why I really hate school, I know learning can not be fun everytime, but it does not mean that it will never be a fun! I do actually like to study but I don't like to study in school. That's what my problem is, I don't study stuff that is pointless and useless and that's what school is. Mostly what they teach you is bs. Because most educated person won't apply their knowledge in future nether use it for any good. That's why school is really stupid and I always feel like I am a dumb whenever I goto school. I seriously hate it, just like if I ever had a chance I would nuke my school building and would save everyone from this hell. My mind is full of depressions, anxieties and tiredness. I just get depressed when I heat about exams. I just get tired to think tomorrow is school. I really can't take it anymore, everyday me going to school and seeing stupid drama and hear dumb lecturing and wasting our time on homeworks, I hate these, I hate the way school teaches. They made the education a buisenuess now. Going to school as a teenager really sucks, our brain isn’t like the kids anymore.\n\nAlthough there is still some persons who do likes school but I don't care for them. I will hate school and will hate it forever.",

In this empty valley voices die faster than  the nightfall, its darkness impossible to escape because there is no  desire to escape. The succession of days is impossible to count, every  day is the next and the previous, their fate tightly fitted like a  diamond in a pendant.*  \n*And so the birdsongs return one day. And it is a  normal day, except for the birds. And their voices. And the fact that  it does not feel like any other day. And then there is a child. A small  child, a normal child. He has tried to escape the village before, but he  always returns, no matter how often he leaves or how far he goes, he  always returns, sitting soundlessly on the porch.*  \n*And today he leaves  again. And so he returns. And when he returns all the birds in the  village have grown flowers in their mouths, their singing voices forever  muted - silence is restored again. And it is a miracle, they say,  because flowers are such a precious thing and the calmness of the  village was so important we cannot dare to lose it, surely we cannot  dare to lose it.*",

And the point of view drifts from Emma to Rodolphe.\n\nNabokov also opposes Flaubert’s transitions with Dickens’—another author he selected for his lectures— whose transitions are simply happening between chapters, like the steps of a staircase.\n\nI wonder if Flaubert's transitions are this much praised because of some sensitivity Nabokov —and maybe you— have, while I don’t, as I don't have any sense of poetry either and *Madame Bovary* being praised too for its poetic qualities is something I’m unable to grasp…\n\nOr could it be that Nabokov is just fond of Flaubert and likes to coin new terms when he notices anything specific and welcomed? (I hope nobody will see this question disrespectful, please forgive my non-native English and my ignorance in literature)\n\nOr maybe I just that I didn’t get the point, the technique behind this piece of the craft. To start with, why does Nabokov call them *structural* transitions? They’re built in with the structure of the plot itself, maybe?\n\nFinally, do you know another author who uses this method? (in case you acknowledge it as something peculiar)\n\nThanks for your help!",

        "text": "**MAJOR UNMARKED SPOILERS BELOW**\n\nI was listening to Piranesi the other day for the millionth time when I realized that there's a relationship between the protagonist's memory and power and the Other's power over him. The more the protagonist forgets, the more power the Other has over him. At one point, the Other even says something like, \"because you forget, I'm the one who sets our goals. Me, not you.\"\n\nMuch later on, the protagonist remembers the wrong the Other has done him. This misdeed is the cause of the protagonist forgetting (among many other things). Only after this act of remembering is the protagonist able to recognize the Other's power over him. Eventually, he frees himself from the Other's control. \n\nThe relationship between memory and power can be simplified into an inverse relationship. Between two conflicting entities, as one's memory of the other's wrongs decreases, the other's power over them decreases. But as one's memory of the other's wrongs increases, the other's memory decreases.",

        "text": "Personally, I think the criticism is a load of bollocks. I mean their reactions to most things in their lives and the way they conduct themselves seems indicative of the way I feel I would react, and often times I can relate to the characters. On top of this, many people share the same sentiment and find his characters relatable.\n\nIf you want to argue they are erratic and at times seemingly insane, that's not really a valid way to deem them unrealistic, as there are people like that in the real world. On top of this, Dostoevsky is highly regarded as a psychologist and contemporary psychological literature supports a lot of what he depicts through his characters.\n\nAnd what examples are there of characters being dramatic beyond reason? Sure you can say Raskolnikov was dramatic, but can you really blame him given the events of the story? And what about The Underground Man, you can say he was dramatic, but that's part of the realistic archetype Dostoevsky meant to depict. And in Demons, I didn't find the characters to be overly dramatic, unless their characterization entailed as much, like with Stepan(guys like Stavrogin and Kirrilov were a bit under dramatic tbh). So I don't see how one can view Dostoevsky's characters as soapy or dramatic beyond reason.",

Perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how was I to know that in twenty years’ time, when I should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day, another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned Bergotte?”\n\nGiven the subjective nature of art, is progress a valid concept? I suppose writers build upon their predecessors; breaking away from forms, becoming more honest and free of censorship, increasing syntactic and symbolic complexity. But are any of these objective advancements? Anyways I’m fascinated by the question and would welcome suggestions for further non-fiction reading on the subject. Thanks!",

I've only got back into reading for the sheer joy of it in the last few years (I'm 43) and it's made me realise that there's nothing I value more. \n\nI usually have more than one book on the go (currently I'm on 'The Portable Door' by Tom Holt, the first 'A Game of Thrones' book by George R.R. Martin, and re-reading various classic crime novels when I'm just in the mood to read something I already know when I'm eating my dinner.) \n\nOne of the things that amazes me is how much time I've wasted NOT reading books. But it also interests me that I like books now that I probably wouldn't have liked when I was 11, or 17, or 30.\n\nDoes anyone else feel that way? Or has gone back to a book they didn't like as a chlld, and found it worth reading and enjoyable now?

I've been studying English since I was 12 I think, but it wasn't until 3-4 months ago that I finally got around to reading English books. So far I've read \"Anne Frank's Diary\" , \"The Outsiders\" by S.E Hilton and I just finished \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" by Oscar Wilde. My experience has been absolutely fascinating and I have to say that it's such a rewarding and wonderful feeling to be able to read and understand a book that was originally written in your target language, it's just unmatchable!\n\n However sometimes I feel that I'm going to slow because obviously there are some words and expressions that I have to look up in the dictionary, or I feel that I have to highlight the main idea of a certain paragraph and go back and take another look at some parts I've already read to make sure I'm not missing out on anything, otherwise I may feel like I might forget things too quickly. Now I don't mind having to make some pauses once in a while, even if I had to make hundred pauses I think I'd still enjoy the book and I know that my reading speed will increase as I read more and more, but unfortunately, this sometimes makes me loose my concentration and I feel that this is killing the whole purpose of extensive reading. \n\nSo I'm basically asking for recommendations of good, rather modern novels (if they contain colloquial expressions, lingo etc that's even better), not too long, with good, engaging characters, decent plot, that may deal with adolescence and youth issues, and if it's written by an American author that would be perfect bc I really wanna go deeply into American culture, way of living, and all its insights. Thanks a lot!\n\nP.S: I'm sorry this was so long. I hope it didn't make you fall asleep. I apologize if there's any spelling mistake :)",

        "text": "I have done my best to avoid using \"I\" when writing documentation, but have ended up mainly using \"we\" instead. For example, instead of:\n\n&gt; **I** resolve the components at compile time, just like the other files. Then **I** do the typechecking pass. Once **I** resolve all the names, **I** can generate the final output.\n\nI would say:\n\n&gt; **We** resolve the components at compile time, just like the other files. Then **we** do the typechecking pass. Once **we** resolve all the names, **we** can generate the final output.\n\nUsing \"I\" takes the reader out of the loop, and focuses it on what I was doing. But using \"we\" puts the reader _into_ the group, and kind of guides them along it feels like. So it's not \"us vs. them\" but \"we together\". So it kind of frames it like they are part of the process.\n\nHowever, it still implies something, that there is a team behind it, even if the team is just of one (haha). And it kind of sounds pompous in a way, hoity-toity. \"We then write the components using the provided text\" implies the reader is taking action to write components using text, and also that the writer is following along.\n\nBut perhaps there is a way to do without \"we\" altogether? What can you do instead of using I/we? Is there a way to make it sound friendly and engaging and personal, yet not hoity-toity? Doing without \"we\" makes it feel a little robotic IMO.\n\n&gt; **The system** resolves the component at compile time, just like the other files. Then **it** does the typechecking pass. Once **it** resolves all the names, **it** can generate the final output.\n\nThat does without we, but perhaps it feels a little harder to understand? What do you think, which way is best? What are alternative better approaches?",
