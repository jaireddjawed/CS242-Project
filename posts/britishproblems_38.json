We’ve now been told that no further payments will be made until ‘the lawyers have looked into things’….. not going to hold my breath about seeing any money.\n\nFan-fucking-tactic news!\n\nLast month was a real struggle what with Christmas and not getting paid, we had to really cut back on the spending and luckily my husband gets a small wage which managed to tide us over, but I am the main breadwinner so Christmas was a very modest affair. We’re now left with £7.42 in the bank, bills to pay and husbands wage doesn’t even cover a weeks electricity, and won’t hit his bank until the end of the month.\n\nJust the start to the new year that I was hoping for. \n\nSorry for the moaning post, I just had to get it off my chest and husband is already stressed and worried and not in the best of health, so didn’t want to burden him with it. So you random internet strangers are the lucky ones who get to hear me moaning instead lol.\n\nHope your new year is going better than mine",
