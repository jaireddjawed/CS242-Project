        "text": "If you have spent enough time on the internet, you should know it often has a very strong anti-(modern) social justice slant, especially feminism.  This is my theory on why the mainstream (English-speaking) internet hates it.\n\nThe internet (especially Reddit) is full of young people (adolescents and young adults) who crave independence and freedom.  Sick and tired of being given obligatory commands by their parents/teachers/etc., they desire not to be told what to do, how to behave, what to think, etc. ever again.  The reason why the web hates feminism/SJ/etc. is the same reason why it is so virulently anti-religion:  They are both prescriptive ideologies.  Both religion and feminism are belief systems that fundamentally prescribe to people certain ways of thinking and behaving even when they may not want to or when it feels counterintuitive, and unlike parental authority this continues over the span of your life and doesn't end when you hit the age of majority.  \n\nThis is not a reflection of mere conservatism/right wing, but rather a strong desire for more \"freedom to\"s (rather than \"freedom from\"s) and the hatred of prescriptive ideologies.  Case in point, the internet (on average) tends to be very LGBT rights affirming - something that would not fly with many conservatives (except perhaps in Europe and from 2016 onwards Canada; the internet is largely American).  If you were on the internet say prior to 2014, you would know that the internet community largely self-identified as liberal but at the same time was very anti-censorship and anti-political correctness.  Until fairly recently, censorship and moral concern over media was associated with conservatives and the Christian right - usually in the form of \"satanic panics\" and outrage over violent or sexualized content in video games.  However, it has become associated with liberals - only this time instead of violence the subject is now sexism and social justice, and this time instead of just children and adolescents the advice now applies to adults.  Now, the ones who are openly defending the media/behaviours/beliefs that are considered problematic are the conservatives and anti-feminist/anti-SJ crowd.  What has previously been seen as oppressive and limiting freedom is now seen as liberating and encouraging freedom, and vice versa.    \n\ntl;dr The reason behind the internet's anti-feminism/anti-SJ/etc. lies not in bigoted/misogynistic/racist/etc. attitudes but rather in a rabid obsession with freedom and individuality and a deep aversion to dogmas and/or doctrines (particularly ones that do not benefit them).  Perhaps in the future, when mainstream feminism (not ones like Sommers) becomes viewed as a defender of \"freedom to\"s the internet will become vehemently pro-feminist.\n\nOf course, this is just how I see things.  Feel free to correct anything that I have said and/or test my beliefs.\n\nP.S. This post is not an endorsement or condemnation of any side (feminism/social justice or anti-feminism/anti-social justice). ",

The end of my post will talk, more than, about memory and a possible advancement of people trying to use our time to pack more interesting knowledge. I will conclude about how we are slowing down in our ability to learn by involving in discussion and learn from more than our preconceptions. Relevant and interesting media can grow, as better sources of information emerge, and people feel more interested to click through to certain profiles of knowledge distributers, says user ithinkimtim in [top- reply about](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/377l72/we_are_all_addicts_and_tldrs_are_just_one_of_the/) tolerance vs the discussion about condensed and exciting gifs. This, however, will make reddit increasingly difficult to use, and its not exactly a problem with how reddit presents information based on voting differences between large and small subreddits.\n\nIt's not that people aren't able to talk with each other, or that we aren't learning because of too much addicting and interesting content.\nCertain people comment and then people vote quickly to agree or disagree. That person who comments could be the type of person who has radical reasons for not liking a group of people, all while being a part of either a neutral or pro-whatever group of redditors. Then, many people who don't comment, input their participation with that single person, such as supergauntlet [saying](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1tee3q/why_do_subreddits_eventually_transform_into_a/ce72yp9/) \"The post that ruined circlebroke\". These users stand out with their own views or subreddits, often commenting about some type of social justice. You can see that supergauntlet's thoughts ended out to be pretty unreasonable once delved into. \nPlus, people seem to have similar habits, that they comment on as truths.  \n”I always check the comments first in case the link is misleading, which is not exactly a rarity...“\n\nthe-ace brought up this issue before on [/theoryofreddit in replies](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/377l72/we_are_all_addicts_and_tldrs_are_just_one_of_the/) with dripdroponmytiptop and DoctorDank to how redditors are becoming better at connecting with their brains in future situations because of how reddit highly condenses a lot of information.  \nThe reply section concludes to show that the context of reddit and its comment system works perfectly fine in a discussion, as long as people talk and eventually understand each other through additional voting or commenting.\n\nAlso, a lot of people spend most of their time on reddit, consuming as much social knowledge as they can, instead of spending time on the links ([comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/37aebv/we_are_all_addicts_part_2/) user: bobglaub)The individuals that make those truth comments are often the ones dedicated posting about that social justice topic.\n\nI'm more interested from these posts not by the idea of how reddit is a microcosm of our society, which made sense to me for a while, but that certain individuals are changing the effect of discussion and the way people can talk. DoctorDank eventually \"lost\" the argument, but combined with their two replies of DoctorDank and dripdroponmytiptop, and my observation of comment upvoted in reply to another comment, I see they brought something up important about the other side of learning. That is, learning from what we make important through conversation. You can see dripdroponmytiptop talking about the difficulty of conversation, and I think it has a little to do with the growing inability of users permitting discussion by upvoting specific user characters. Those specific users can often be found in the 2nd position in a contextual reply. 1st being the conversation starter or top-level. The problem of not learning is that this is a problem with reddit and people. \"People\", as referred to in the circlebroke [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=circlebroke).  \nIt also matters how quickly people ascertain their information (discussion in the-ace's thread and another comment about voting quickly) and use their vote and move on to the next interesting comment. People also do not stick around to see more relevant comments. And that is discussed some more by people offering front page vote alterations, comment chains calculated for interest to a user. And, figuring out how people deal with the abundance of content and how quickly some content can be pushed up, making other (according to some) in-depth and important comments or articles not recognized.\n\nKyle0654 ([reply in circlebroke](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f/)) and thisisanewacccount ([reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/377l72/we_are_all_addicts_and_tldrs_are_just_one_of_the/crkgxbj/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=TheoryOfReddit)) talk similarly about subreddits and news, fluff and tl;dr. ithinkimtim (referred to earlier) and some others in the-ace's [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/377l72/we_are_all_addicts_and_tldrs_are_just_one_of_the/), talked about how people will pay attention to what becomes a better source of information, and use of tl;dr helps people pick out that information. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome things that aren't related that I want to bring up:  \n\n1 ..New comments, and nearby comments in time, need to more readable and viewable. Like having a \"new\" sorting algorithm, but for keeping up with new reply chains that haven't continued. As opposed to changing how the front page decays or giving users their own choice of complexity for new sort ([comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f/) user:in8nirvana).  \nAnd, instead of mods applying special vote algorithms ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c57eey4/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=circlebrokep)), reviewing comment section content using pre-loading ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c57f1zr/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=circlebroke)), or weakening ranking of \"pointless\" content ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c57jg3x/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=circlebroke))\n\n2 ..The front page puts off a lot of smart people. The reason smart people are here is a similar accomplishment to how BBS were in the 90s, with educated people involved themselves and posted condensed knowledge about a topic. The voting system works a lot on the front page, and a lot of this front page momentum works against the majority of users using the subreddit. Truthfully, there are not many idiots around, that we can see ([reply](aryst0krat) user:arystocrat. But the overall feel of the site makes people think that those who vote are either stupid or shills. The fact is that there is either very even participation voting and comment wise, or none at all, or an occasional user signing up to comment. The comment wise varies based on reddit personality, but that's a neglible part of how the front page is affected, in fact it may cause more for the feel of the comments and moderation of small subreddits.\n\n3 ..Complaining about users gaining karma or playing along with fads in subreddits is pointless because that is part of the enjoyment for many redditors ([comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/c56x55f/) user:HealthConnection). The outcome of karma is a combination of all sorts of posts.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/5ntimg/an_analysis_of_the_average_reading_grade_level_of/",
        "text": "### Intro\n\nHello /r/TheoryofReddit!\n\nI browse 3 political news discussion subreddits daily (politics, PoliticalDiscussion, and NeutralPolitics) and while reading the comments for each I noticed that the language used was different depending on the subreddit. I grew curious as I read an article about the average reading grade level of each of the Presidential Candidates, and decided to run my own experiment using the comments of these 3 subreddits.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nBased purely on my own speculation, I guess that NeutralPolitics will have the highest average grade level since it appears to be the most \"curated\" of the 3. I'd guess PoliticalDiscussion will come next highest, though I wouldn't be surprised if it's higher since it encourages more \"discussion\" over pure \"neutrality\". In last is politics, since it was once a default sub it carries a higher number of users and therefore encourages less intelligent discussion.\n\n### Data\n\nThis data is mostly courtesy of /u/Stuck_In_The_Matrix from /r/datasets who [scraped Reddit comments into a dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/) and /u/fhoffa in /r/bigquery who [uploaded them](https://www.reddit.com/r/bigquery/comments/3cej2b/17_billion_reddit_comments_loaded_on_bigquery/) to Google BigQuery for easy SQL querying.\n\nWe're only using the last 3 months of data (November, October, September of 2016). I used the following SQL query in BigQuery to narrow down my results to a table:\n\n    SELECT\n      body, author, subreddit, score, created_utc\n    FROM\n      [fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2016_11],[fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2016_10],[fh-bigquery:reddit_comments.2016_09]\n    WHERE\n      subreddit='PoliticalDiscussion'\n      AND body NOT IN ('[removed]','[deleted]')\n      AND score &gt; 1\n\nThe query excludes deleted and removed comments and also comments which score below 1. I performed this query 3 times, 1 for each of the subreddits, giving me 3 tables of data. Since they aren't that massive (politics about a gig, political discussion about 150 MB, and neutralpolitics about 90 MB) I decided to download them for further analysis. Downloading all 3 tables into CSVs and we're ready to move onto our next phase.\n\n[Mega link to all CSV's used](https://mega.nz/#F!uBwW1IDL!DlUMSS5usjy-FjysZb94dQ)\n\n### Experiment\n\nEdit: Just want to clarify, we'll be using the [Flesch-Kincaid readability test for Grade Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch.E2.80.93Kincaid_grade_level) which approximates the average grade level readability of the text. So a score of 6 would be easily readable by 6th grade students and a score of 10 would be easily readable by 10th grade students, but not by 6th grade students.\n\nI decided to use a Python script to analyze the data. Using the [textstat](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/textstat/) module we can get all kinds of cool information about our comments.\n\n[Here's](http://pastebin.com/VcuyVcfv) the code I used (I apologize to Python devs for the mess, it's not my first language).\n\nAfter performing the experiment a few times I realized that the results were a little too similar. I suspect this is because the larger the sample size the more \"averaged\" the results become, so I decided to narrow our test down even further and filtered out comments with less than a score of 50.\n\n### Results\n\n**NeutralPolitics**\n\nComments Analyzed: 9452\n\nAverage Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Score: **8.2965**\n\n**PoliticalDiscussion**\n\nComments Analyzed: 15096\n\nAverage Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Score: **8.3187**\n\n**Politics**\n\nComments Analyzed: 150762\n\nAverage Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Score: **7.1558**\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt's interesting to see PoliticalDiscussion on top, though not entirely surprising considering they value discussion over the neutrality of the content (not that that's bad). It seems like in general I was right when it came to the average grade level score of the comments.\n\n**Bonus Round!**\n\nSome extra subreddits I was curious about:\n\n- The_Donald - **7.3837** (SPICY! 🔥🔥🔥) - 128293 comments analyzed\n- EnoughTrumpSpam - **7.0717** - 18317 comments analyzed\n- HillaryClinton - **6.3207** - 4706 comments analyzed\n\n----\n\nLet me know if you have any subreddits you want me to compare for you, now that I have the system setup I can calculate them pretty quick!",

The mechanics of the front page allow for the highest ranked posts on a subreddit to make r/all, the mechanics of this rule meant that if a post on the_donald was in top spot then that would be suppressed from the front page, and number 2 wouldn't move up into that position. \n\nMy theory is that t_d has been suppressing itself from the front page to create a feeling of victimization. I'm not sure why they have stopped doing this today.\n\nEdit: If you look through the webarchive of the_donald you will notice the stickies changing very regularly. This has always been the case at the_donald, but after the rule change you would have thought they would have stopped doing this to keep their presence on r/all and just use stickies to announce forum rules like every other subreddit. \n\nEdit 2: I just wanted to point out that now their top post on [all is at 137](http://imgur.com/a/LHqm1). However [this is 4th on their frontpage](http://imgur.com/a/gSVUx). As two of the posts above it are stickies I'm not sure their overall ranking, but as the top two have more upvotes in less time, one can only assume they have a higher ranking. td have effectively hidden their top 3 positions from all.",

I've recently realised that the interior voice of my mind tends to 'read out' comments in a very similar tone: especially funny or witty top-level comments. It's almost as if I subconsciously see this site as sort of a two-way thing between myself and this mysterious 'character' that says a lot of things on a lot of different threads. Users only really gain an identity when I consciously make the effort to think of them as separate beings.\n\nI suspect I'm not alone in this bias and I also suspect it's a reason why people often treat the users of this site - or the users of a specific subreddit - as a sort of community with a single voice rather than a collection of individuals. I used to use forums quite a lot and that was never the case there: the presence of big usernames, avatars and signatures always made it very clear that an individual was typing something. On Reddit you  barely notice a username unless your attention is drawn to it for some reason.\n\nSo am I alone in experiencing this phenomenon?",

        "text": "Background: I am an independent, politically. There are views held by various parties that I find appealing, and views held by those same parties I find unappealing, and there are views held by no parties that i similarly find attractive and unattractive. I do not find that any one party seems to be what I want, though sometimes certain candidates represent ideas and values that align more or less with my political ideals. As a responsible citizen, I feel like it is my duty to know and understand the views and policies that not only the leadership of political parties and their factions promote, but also the views and policies that their voter base promote, regardless of my support of these parties and factions. Therefore, I subscribe to various political subreddits, Everything from r/altright to r/libertarian to r/anarchism. Everything across the board. What I have started to notice in the last year or so are three things.\n\n1: There are way more political subreddits than there use to be devoted to political ideation and designation\n\n - 1A: Most of the new subs are devoted to political paradigms that are further from the center\n\n - 1B: These new subreddits seem to be less about the actual political paradigm they claim to be devoted to and more about opposition against other political paradigms\n\n - 1C: Over the last few months, for somewhat obvious reasons, these oppositional posts have been intensifying, and not always in a good, or productive way. **Biases and prejudices are becoming more extreme**\n\n\n2: The more niche the political paradigm associated with the subreddit is, the more these Biases and Prejudices seem to occur in the sub (think r/altright vs r/conservative)\n \n - 2A: These Biases are directly related to how far the political paradigm is from center in both intensity, frequency, and popularity. \n\n - 2B: the further the paradigm is from the center, the less opposition or debate there is in the subreddit. \n\n - 2C: the further the bias or prejudice represented by the post is from neutral, the less opposition or debate there is, and the frequency and intensity of the echo chamber activity in the comments increases\n\n3: The further the political paradigm a subreddit is devoted to seems to be inversely related to the amount of actual news, articles, or law based opinion posts, and directly related to the amount of personal opinion, anecdotal, or purely speculative and/or prejudiced content posts the sub. \n\nOne of the reasons reddit is beautiful is that it allows for a varied and more far reaching web for current events, news, opinions, etc. than any other platform. it is unique in that by allowing for informational biases in content (each subreddit is biased in that it only contains posts relevant to that sub), it has the opportunity to eliminate cultural biases in overall user exposure. However, I believe that this exact unique property of reddit also has the potential to enact the opposite effect, of creating an echo chamber where new ideas cannot enter or challenge the user's awareness and/or existing paradigms and socio-cultural/ideological biases. \n\n**As users of reddit who concern themselves with the theory of reddit, do you believe that reddit, as it currently is functioning and is used, actually promotes multicultural/social and multi ideological views and education, or does it function as an echo chamber masquerading as a democratic information source?**\n\nWhat do you think, and, if you are unhappy with the current functional use of reddit by redditors, what could instigate the change you want to see?",

And now it's somehow done a complete 180 and become the very thing it was created to make fun of? \n\nAfter doing some digging, I think I can blame the old [SRoTD post](https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/57riyi/october_16th_2016_rcannotwatchscottstots_the/) for this - not only does the author misunderstand the point of the subreddit (calling it a \"one year old community of over 2500 people who felt the same as me [about the episode]\"), but he also manages to completely miss the point of the Scott's Tots episode, going as far as to call it a *bad* episode (\"It's painful to see such a high quality TV show sink this low.\" \"...Scott's Tots is the worst thing ever written into the show. There were some low points later on with Robert California, but nothing this cringy.

More so than you usually see from those with such strong opinions. I see threads and comments that completely contradict their agendas or the point they are trying to make, and the only way they respond is with name-calling, much like trolls.\n\nBasically, trolls use the agendas of subreddits to make threads and comments that draw conflict with other users and cause them to get butthurt, but are not downvoted since the subreddit they posted on supports their claims since they strongly support their agendas. By doing this, the trolls get a reaction from people drawn to the ridiculous statements, and the supporters of the claims get roped into the drama as well. A win-win for trolls.",

        "text": "I post in different subs and I have noticed some general patterns of behavior. I am selfish and only observe my own posts so it has some bias, but I feel these are true:\n\n\n\n**Do as others do : kick the dog**\n\nWhen a post is in the negatives, even if it doesn't suck, is appropriate, helpful, on topic, and non-offensive, eg, there is nothing bad about it, if it is in the negatives, it gets more negative votes. I believe that some of this is just assholes, but I believe the larger portion are people who are merely doing as others did - this is common in psychology and you can observe it in real life all the time, from the way waiting lines work to where trash ends up.\n\n**Extreme Prejudice**\n\nWhen there is a very good post, if it mentions someone or something that the voter vehemently doesn't like, it gets downvoted. This can be a mention to a movie star to a training technique to the insinuation someone might be rich. Sometimes the mention has to do with unlikable things in this universe - like how humans aren't in control of everything, market fluctuations, etc. I think this is most like the anti-vax movement where someone believes something and plugs their ears to everything else, downvoting accordingly. It doesn't matter how many gems of goodness the post or commented had, to the voter, it is a hair in their soup and it gets sent back to the kitchen no matter what.\n\nThis is especially harmful behavior in self-help / improvement subs where the answer is something unpleasant. For example, an empathy sub for weight-loss that has turned into a circle-jerk and a post/submission that talks about dieting and exercise ; because the person does not want to do so in their own life, they downvote. \n\nIn other words, the downvote has everything to do with the voter, and nothing to do with the actual content. \n\n**Extreme Competitiveness**\n\nA person makes a post and downvotes all other posts because they want their post to be the highest rated, or because they believe their post is better - not that other posts are incorrect, bad, or wrong. This happens more in places where it is easy to do so, like a submission with very few comments. \n\n**Empathy FIRST**\n\nIn self-help / improvement subs, I notice that posts with stories, sharing support, etc, are always the top comments. The posts with information on _what_ to do or _how_ to do it are always mid-page. This corresponds to real-life where people are quick to do things that have little to no long-term impact rather than things with long-term impact. Consider a person presenting depression, and the top comments are overwhelming stories, love, and support - curiously, even overwhelmingly long! The mid-page to least-voted responses are ones suggesting a doctor's visit, treatment, etc, things that will change their life. \n\nThis is harmful! Yes, an internet hug is nice, but it means that the person will not get the _real_ help that they need to fix whatever it is. \n\n**Snark is Lord**\n\nPeople browse reddit to kill time so it's no surprise that witty comments, no matter how unhelpful, are common in the top-comment spot. Even if the topic is self-improvement / self-help.\n\n**Brevity First**\n\nThe person who addresses a single side-issue with a half-sentence is always top comment. Never the comment that addressed all the issues and answered all the questions, even if what was actually written by the author is fewer words than the half-sentence. Because it appears long, it is long. Even if the post is not long at all but addresses all the questions/issues, it is now _tedious_. So, the redditor upvoters who are here to kill time, do not upvote as much, because it is not as entertaining.\n\n**Pedestal of loathing**\n\nVoters are humans and many are hurting. When they encounter a comment or submission that agrees with this loathing or hurt, they upvote it, even massively overwhelming other, better, or more helpful posts. You will see this when the submitter did something bad, or when the submitter has an edge over normal people. Watch what happens to someone who asks for advice on what to do next now that he cheated on his wife (1) male and (2) cheater means the top comment is a scathing, unhelpful remark no matter how remorseful the submitter was. Watch what happens to someone who implies they don't have time for something, or some small insinuation they might be wealthy, have a great job connection, etc. There is no support for them now (see Empathy FIRST), just a collective boo'ing. \n\n**Fury**\n\nSometimes there are self-help submissions that resonates with something that happened to a voter, and a horrible comment is top comment. This is because the voters remember a situation that happened to them and they vote what they wish they had done, no matter how absurdly horrible the consequences will be for the submitter. The voters remember their own situation and vote with unabashed fury, not thinking about the submitter at all; instead, their vote is all about them.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed my post, and I am interested in what other trends you all have observed - especially if you can tie them back to human behavior. \n\n\n",

Now, the curtain has been drawn back, and it's much clearer how large the site has become.\n\nThe biggest Reddit posts are now topping somewhere over 100K upvotes, which, according to the 90-9-1 rule, suggests they've been viewed by somewhere between one and ten million people. This is an unimaginably large audience, a number that staggers the imagination when one actually thinks about it, and it only gets ignored because of the natural temptation is to compare it to titans like Twitter and Facebook. This is a false equivalency, as they are by nature even more granular and compartmentalised than Reddit, which has the front page and /r/all to focus a much higher percentage of the userbase onto the occasional outstanding post.\n\nOverall, it's become clear that 'the Front Page of the Internet' is more than just a slogan. It's quickly becoming a reality, and one that I don't think either the userbase or the admins are prepared to handle.\n\nSo, my question to you all is, has this changed how you perceive Reddit?
