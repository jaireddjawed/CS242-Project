Autistic people are constantly punished for being unable to do things that are overwhelming or being unable to do things because of executive dysfunction and it makes sense that after enough cycles of being forced to do something that triggers sensory overload or being forced into a high adrenaline state to complete a task through executive dysfunction that eventually demands as a whole would become triggering because you anticipate subconsciously that your needs aren’t going to be considered and you’re going to be forced into a horrible situation. It just feels weird to me that this is being pathologized as just an autism thing that someone’s born with or something and not understood as trauma? Because it really looks like trauma",

Mainly being politics, guns, abortion, conspiracy theories,  computers, or whatever the right-wing news story of the day is. I've had a few conversations with him where I actually engaged. All of which went poorly. I feel like he thought a lot of the things I said were personal attacks where I was trying my best not to offend him. It felt like I had to be careful with what I said so I wouldn't make him upset. We lived in a dorm together and there was one lounge with a tv. We would watch a movie and when he came in, he would interrupt the movie. when we asked him to stop talking so we could watch the movie, he would either refuse as it was a public place or make us feel guilty for saying something. But then he asks us to tell him things directly and straight up because he has autism but when you are asking people to directly tell you that they don't like you (which he has done on multiple occasions) it can be incredibly difficult to be honest when the fact of the matter is, he provokes us politically that feels purposeful, doesn't listen when we tell him things politely, then gets upset and makes us feel guilty when we tell him the truth (depending on the situation but usually he asks if we want him to leave, stop talking, why he isn't invited to things, whether we like him or not, etc.). It seems like he is really self-conscious about it because he keeps asking about it but when we give honest answers it results in him getting angry and starting an argument or making us feel guilty for saying something. But even after all that, he comes back and talks to us like nothing happened. What can I do?\n\nTruth of the matter is that he annoys me, I'm ashamed to feel this way about it too because I don't know if any of this is within his control, but I'm trying to adjust my outlook but everytime he talks to me or anyone and I see how uncomfortable they get it just makes me upset and uncomfortable and I want to leave the room as quickly as possible. \n\nIs this bad? Am I bad person for really not being able to tolerate this guy and genuinely getting upset when I see him?",

        "text": "Hi everyone! I just wanted to pop in and ask a quick question. \n\nThrough my life, no doctor has ever thought I was on the spectrum. But the more I learn about ASD in class, I am not too sure. I have a lot of little things, and my roommate flatly told me she thought “I thought you were autistic”. I wouldn’t say that, but I’d definitely consider myself slightly on the spectrum (I mean, it IS a spectrum). I was misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder, which ended up actually being adult ADHD. But I have some characteristics that are similar to people on the spectrum. For instance….\n\n- I absolutely need a routine/schedule. When I wake up, I work out then go to work or school. I can’t do it any other order or else I get extremely distressed or have meltdowns. Like this morning, I had work at 6:00am-15:00pm and while I could’ve worked out after work, and it would’ve been better for my health to get more than 4 hours of sleep, I woke up at 5:00am because that was less distressing than doing it after\n- I have trouble staying in conversation around things I am not interested in. It seems I can ONLY converse about things I’m interested in or can relate to directly or else I zone out. Or usually if I have something I monitor the conversation for when I can bring it up and don’t actually listen. \n- I can’t switch plans on the fly and need to be prepared. My LDR boyfriend turned up for a surprise visit, and I almost had a breakdown from distress. I hate new situations and don’t like meeting new people. I even watch the same shows over and over because I know what’s going to happen and I like that predictability. I have to plan my day with things I’m going to do exactly. \n- I need things to be extremely timely. If I have a meeting or agree to call a friend and it’s even 4 minutes late, I get anxious and agitated.\n- I have intense interests that I hyperfixate on. As a kid, I loved all animals and bugs and would check out books about them, write books about them, watch videos, etc. They were all I wanted to talk about and nothing else. I can’t even begin to focus on things I’m not interested in (but this maybe ADHD) \n- I have issues with sensory things. High pitched and loud noises give me headaches and make me extremely irritated to the point I snap at anyone making them. I’m sensitive to textures to, and even doing work I’m aware of how every article of clothing feels on my body \n- I hate eye contact and am not a fan of hugs and touching from anyone other than my boyfriend, including my parents. I hug friends because that’s what I was grown up being told to do, and that it comforts them. But when people hug me, it just makes me anxious and uncomfortable. I feel like I’m being suffocated more than being comforted or loved. As for eye contact, again, I do it because I have to not because I like it and it makes me very uneasy. \n- I observe patterns and focus far more on details than the overall picture of things. This isn’t a good example, but doing puzzles, I have trouble if I’m staring at the picture. I can only do puzzles if I’m staring at the specific pieces\n- As a child, I had issues with imaginative play. I would mimic and take on characters I saw on tv or in movies and pretend to be them, but I could never create and be a character. I usually preferred playing alone and now I prefer working alone. \n- Sometimes I have trouble understanding how people don’t see that they would upset me, and usually start crying from frustration when they don’t. The flip side of this is I can see how I upset them, sometimes, but am always incredibly confused as to how someone could not understand I’d be hurt by their actions even when it’s unreasonable to assume they’d know. It’s like I expect people would be able to read my mind. I have extreme emotion regulation difficulties when I feel my boundaries have been pushed or I feel disrespected. \n- I need rules to be explicitly stated to me. Even if it’s an expectation, unless it is communicated directly with me, I will not follow through with it. For some reason, I can’t process implied things or things with hidden meanings unless it involve emotion (but that may be me being too sensitive, like thinking the way someone phrased something means they’re mad). \n\nThere’s more but I can’t think of them at the moment. The only issue is that while I fit all of Cluster B, I don’t have anything really from Cluster A. I have issues with knowing when not to speak and the lack of shared interests, but nothing else. I am good at reading emotions (though I rely on tone, breathing changes, word choice, etc) more than expression. I can adjust appropriately to social situations and I am able to predict what other people would think, how they would feel, and what they would do in a situation. I do have issues with maintaining relationships due to problems with interests and emotional outbursts/crying during conflict or arguments with romantic partners. \n\nI don’t think I have autism specifically, but I think I may be on the spectrum. I hate to self-diagnose, and these may all just be ADHD. I am thinking about asking my doctor his thoughts. But I don’t know if I’m just looking into something that isn’t there and overthinking.

        "text": "A conversation I had in here the past few days has led me to believe that it’s not. It’s made me realize that there may be a lot of people in this space feeding/believing the stereotypes of BPD and that’s both really scary to me and also really harmful. I have been diagnosed with both and I believe that both diagnosis are correct for me. The first thing I want to say is BPD does not make for a “bad” person. You don’t have to be manipulative or gaslighters to be diagnosed. Not all people with BPD are abusive. In fact one whole subtype of BPD is called quiet BPD and that’s when the destruction from the intense emotions (often intense fear of abandonment) turns inwards instead of outwards. That doesn’t mean it’s not BPD either. I have intense splitting and loss of self over a major fear of abandonment but my destruction is turned inward. Sure there might be times in my life when I’ve been manipulative but that’s true for everyone. Manipulation is not at all common for me and It’s not at all why I was diagnosed with BPD. I still have BPD without being a bad/abusive person. And that’s true for many. Just because you meet someone with BPD who’s not abusive doesn’t mean they’ve been misdiagnosed. Saying things like that is contributing to the stereotype. “You can’t be a good person and have BPD” kinda thing. “Something else must be wrong.” I said this to someone else on here but doing this is no different than someone with BPD saying “well from my experience autistic people like trains so if you don’t like trains you must have been misdiagnosed.” It’s contributing to a very harmful stereotype. Now imagine if that stereotype was “you have BPD you must be abusive” and how that would make you feel. It’s hurtful, it’s false, and it’s not a safe space for us with BPD if this rhetoric is allowed.",

I might get temporarily relief at best when trying to process and regulate my emotions.\n\nBasically, it starts off with a person who's opinion I care about and they do something that I perceive as them treating me poorly. I might know that my impression is unreliable or that they have other stuff going on that explains why they treated me unfairly, but at this point I can't hold my feelings back, they fester and I get really angry and upset, and holding it in only delays an inevitable eruption. I'm just unable to be the bigger person or be chill or be understanding and let go of my upset.\n\nWhen I do express myself to them, basically I let them know that I'm upset, why I'm upset, what impact it has made on my life. I don't request anything specific from them other than that they hear me out. After that, depending on whether they apologize or acknowledge what I've been through or not, my feelings may quickly resolve as I realize how reasonable their side of things has been, that they didn't deliberately hurt me. Or alternatively, I continue being upset at them if they rejected my perspective and offer zero empathy and I subsequently try to cut them off from my life or demote them in my mind to someone unworthy of my kindness and consideration.\n\nEither way, I know I'm behaving in a somewhat impulsive manner that some people might say is more common for children who lack emotional maturity. But as far as I know, I really can't seem to do any better. I do my heavy self-expression, (and by the way, when I'm upset like that I can barely function productively at work), and I experience the positive or negative consequence of my \"overreaction\", and only then do I gain the experience to be able to handle the same situation better in future without being as \"dramatic\".\n\nThis kind of thing might happen 1-2 times a year with a boss, friend, colleague, family member, or someone I'm dating.",

        "text": "I realized this past year that I'm deeply autistic but do a good enough job masking to fool most people even though it requires a ton of energy. I'm a guy in my mid-20s, mostly work from home in a big city which is a blessing and a curse.\n\nWith all these New Years resolutions, I've been trying to tell myself to be more \"emotionally honest\", whatever that means in particular. One of my biggest challenges is meeting people while masking and then not really knowing how or how much to show them of my inner self since I feels so easy to scare people away.\n\nHow are people \"supposed\" to express emotions? It feels like any semblance of balance is nearly impossible to achieve.\n\n - If you share your inner emotions (if they even exist at that moment), then you risk coming across as \"needy\" or \"overly emotional\".\n - If you try the opposite, then it's easy to come across indifferent, \"fake\", or not \"emotionally available\" in the case of relationships.\n\nI default to this \"chill\" emotionally \"eh, whatever\" kind of deal and try to look at things positively or just plainly as literal facts. I probably laugh too much. I guess being unoffensive gets boring pretty soon but is good enough most the time.\n\nHas anyone else struggled with this? Or tried to find a better way to phrase it in their head? I guess there are simply too many situation rules to really bother.",

First of all, my first language isn't English so I'm sorry if there's typos or it's hard to understand what I'm saying.\nSo recently, while trying to find as many clues as I can in order to do a successful self diagnosis (I've been doing extensive months of research), I found out, thanks to a family gathering, that when I was a baby, like sense the moment I was born, I was unable of drinking milk. I would just spill it or vomit it immediately. This caused many problems, obviously, because my parents couldn't feed me properly. Tbh I don't know the resolution to this situation, my parents just switched the theme of the conversation and didn't let me do more questions, but I know I never grew out of it, I still hate milk and the way it feels in my mouth.\nFor what I know, my parents sent me to many doctors and they did too many tests, in fear thinking maybe I was sick or I had a digestive problem, but nothing, no results, to this day the cause is unknown.\n\nNow. The only thing that popped in my mind was that maybe I have a big problem with the texture of foods (through out all my life I've been a picky eater because of the way some foods feel in my mouth) and I noticed a lot of people here in this community have the same or similar problem. \nSo, I wanted to ask for your opinions! Is it maybe my hypothesis of me being autistic or maybe something else? Or feel free to share similar experiences if you had. I really want to understand myself and know the source of this. \nThanks for reading!",

It's been a major breakthrough in my life, of course, as it's helped me accept parts of myself that i have always thought were \"broken\" or \"wrong\". I share many many experiences that you guys and other autistic folks on youtube talk about and discuss, and I am 100% in no doubt that I am ND. It's overall been a pleasant and very validating experience.\n\nSadly however, this also comes along with the realization that I have been a high masking female for my entire life. Probably since about first grade, I think? Hard to know exactly. Anyway, I recently came out to several of my very close friends. Most of them accepted it, however one (my closest one, in fact, that I've had .. relations with in the past), hasn't really been very validating or willing to entertain the idea that I have autism. Last night he gave me the indication that I have become too much to handle this month, that my communication skills have diminished, I'm needy and helpless, and that essentially I am just identifying too strongly with my \"neurodivergent enlightenment\".\n\nOfc you can see why this would be a bit alarming. I've been trying to unmask myself to these people because I am so incredibly exhausted and burnt out from pretending to be \"normal\" or whatever they are most comfortable with or whatever makes me more appealing to them... and I guess I am feeling rejected because the real me isn't good enough anymore for this person.\n\nI'm not really looking for advice on how to fix that friendship. really what I'm looking for here is some commeraderie or anyone who has shared the experience of \"being too autistic\" after they've unmasked or come out to their friends or family.\n\nThank you.

        "text": "I'm having a hard time making the title make sense, so hopefully elaborating on this a bit will help, if you got confused. I also hope I don't make anyone too mad.\n\nI'm in multiple marginalized groups. Whether it's because of this or not, I am often able to see common themes between the different groups and their experiences and sometimes bring them up, at times by saying what worked in one community might have some applicable value in a different one  (trying to \"borrow\" patterns of discourse from one group to suggest to another gets people especially inflamed).\n\nFor example, though there are definitely idiosyncratic differences between all of the shades of discrimination and prejudice, all of the undesirable -isms are primarily rooted in fear, tribalism, not being able to extend empathy to people to distant from one's in-groups, and who applied the most physical force to get what they wanted centuries or millennia ago. Things are a bit more nuanced of course, but that's the basic gist of all of it. Another is when I have pointed out that people, no matter how oppressed, generally struggle on a variety of levels to navigate relations with people who don't narrowly share all of their group memberships, which is what makes intersectionality so hard to instill and lateral oppression so difficult to combat. Apparently, this enrages people and often gets them into an intense, vaguely oppression olympics-fueled apples to oranges mode, and usually, they're so livid as to why whatever comparison I made was insensitive wasn't immediately obvious that they can't even begin to explain. I also think some of them get upset that since I don't think viscerally in the same way about these kinds of discussions, that I'm some kind of cold, heartless robot who applies \"too much logic\".  \n\nA couple of more niche examples include when I once said I felt that segregating bathrooms by sex or gender is similar to segregating bathrooms by skin color and when I said that autism parents need to find a term besides \"autism mom\" (and other gendered parents) closer to \"ally\" and \"questioning\" as done in the LGBT community for those who are either outsiders or unsure they're outsiders. The more specific I get about the parallels I find, I feel like the more heated the response.\n\nI also feel like this is a bit related to why little gestures like handshakes or nods feel more like driving or doing math than breathing and are very rehearsed and mechanical for me. Since where I'm from does handshakes, but somewhere else bows, to me, germs aside, I don't see a rational reason to do one or the other in any particular region other than \"fitting in\", and see them as arbitrary, essentially interchangeable gestures that signify really similar things.\n\nI kind of wonder if I'm just missing a little bit of innate groupfeel instinct with this. In a lot of ways for me, my identities are just informational shorthand to describe basic attributes about myself using a common language and are sometimes arbitrarily selected for mistreatment, and don't carry a ton of emotional attachment, especially when they themselves are arbitrary lines drawn in the sand.",

        "text": "Hello! I'll begin with saying, thank you all so much for making this community, and being so kind and informative, I've personally been recently lurking communities related to autism because I'm suspecting I may be autistic given I relate with a bunch of stuff I read (that I believe is the default human condition, I'm still not sure about that one)\n\nWhat makes me think I do have autism though is the traits that certainly can't just be summed up to the default human condition.\n\nFirst, I think I am intuitive with language, I didn't learn it in an academic way, and something which I kins of find a benefit is the way I am intuitive about it, I often predict what a term may mean, and I also generally just feel about words and the such.\n\nThe negative to that is, first, I have trouble with my natal language, I learned English myself (I think I'm fairly decent, my English teachers from before who tried to take an interest in me, liked me) but given that it's the internet age, I get to speak less and less of my native language (this recently changed since I've been interacting with a group of people whom share my interest from my country, but I generally speak a mix of my native language and english, but I find myself going to English subconsciously and just operating with the semantics of the English language). I think this is less of an issue, but as a byproduct my vocabulary in both languages is unique and hard to understand. My native language teacher told me that I have a complex vocabulary but it happens that I don't use it right. She thought it was posh but it isn't my intent, I just don't have the words at rhe moment to express myself better. This is primarily because I basically translate myself from English to my native language, given most of my communication and reading happens to be in English. It's certainly an issue, and it's being poinfes out by many people. At a family level, my mom understands my blabbering mess as she's used to me not being able to find my words.\n\nI think that I can fix the first issue by merely reading more in my native language to learn to better express myself (generally I think I would do that by appropriating someone's synthesis of feelings written down), but what bothers me more is my troubles with audio processing. I've always beem loud and told I can't whisper, and I have problems with actually understanding people. I generally call that hearing issues, but I don't think it is about hearing. I hear people but I don't understand what it means until later on. If you say something, you may have to repeat yourself many times, or you may have to wait for me to actually process what you said (not as in come to terms emotionally with it or whatever, just for me to actually process the audio input, for me to know what you said). I was professionally tested for my hearing (in one of those soundproof rooms with headphones and a thing with a button). I remember feeling really weird in the isolated soundproof room, at a sensory level. Didn't feel good especially without headphones. It's been so long though, so I don't remember how it was exactly, I just remember not enjoying the experience whatsoever. Anyway my mother said she thinks it's an attention issue, but the thing is I may be paying attention yet still not be able to immediately process after something's been said. I don't think it's hearing because I may ask someone to repeat themselves and before they do I actually process what they said and understand.\n\nFor the first issue I noted, do you guys think I'm just socially stunted? I'm not introverted or antisocial, just really passionate about the work I do and I don't feel bad about staying inside and working, I alsi don't feel the need to go outside to socialize with friends most of the time, although I love speaking and being with them, but with the pandemic and everything things didn't go hand in hand.\n\nFor the second issue, what could it be? Do you guys have any issues of the such? I posted about this here because I saw people having the same as the first issue on r/autism. I also think that maybe I'll see someone that may deal with the same issue but have it figure out, and hopefully if there's such a person here, they may also enlighten me\n\nI'm sorry if this was the wrong place to ask, and I thank everyone in advance",

I've noticed that I get overwhelmed a lot if there's too many different sensory inputs at once, or that a lot of the time people are getting annoyed at me for what I think are reasonable questions because my tone is wrong, or I can't tell if someone is frustrated or just angry, and if I try to apologize we both get frustrated because I can't put my thoughts into words and they think I'm upset at what they're saying, but I'm just worried that I'm apologizing wrong and just adding more fuel to the fire because I can't accurately say what I mean.\n\nI asked one of my best friends (on the spectrum) if he's noticed any autistic traits and he said that I sometimes hyperfixate on certain issues, or I'm sometimes the last person to understand a joke.\n\nI took a test earlier and I got a 28 (I'm not sure what the name of the test was, it was just the first one that came up on Google and I 100% get that that's not the same as a diagnosis at all), but that led me to the Raads-R test, and I ended up with a 130, which it said is bang on the average number people with autism score.\n\nThe thing is, I don't really know if I \\*get\\* it. Like I'm taking the test and I feel like a lot of it is supposed to be instinctive, but I'd be double thinking myself, wondering if I was over-reporting or under-reporting. There's definitely common traits that I don't have, or else ones that don't affect me that badly. I know a lot of autistic people have strict routines, which I don't, but I also really don't like having things jump on my or having my plans change unexpectedly. I'm generally okay with people, but I sometimes feel like they don't make sense. Like it's so easy for other people to just get along and I'm always afraid of saying the wrong thing, or I'll take offense to something that isn't meant to be offensive or I'll make a joke or comment I feel is matching the tone and it's way out of line. \n\nI'm going to speak to a doctor and find out for sure, but basically how accurate is the test in your experiences, and what can I expect going forward? I've done some digging and it *seems* to be legit, but I'd rather get info from people with experience instead of relying solely on the site.",

        "text": "Ok a neurodivergent friend of mine recently said she felt I was likely neurodivergent. I’ve always thought I might be in the spectrum but have never pursued it. There are lots of things I can definitely relate to, but one that really bothers me that I’m wondering if it’s an autism thing or if I’m just a psycho. So.\n\nI have a lot of sensory issues. I’m hyper aware of the way things feel on my skin/super picky about clothes because I’ll fixate on the texture or fit issue all day if one exists. I also get ragey about certain sounds, like if I’m in a quiet environment and suddenly a repetitive sound starts happening that shouldn’t be happening (think foot tapping, pen clicking, finger snapping) I will go from 0-100 enraged. It makes my skin crawl and I NEED it to stop. But the one that bothers me is my reaction to pain. In particular, sudden pain caused by another human (think stepping on my foot, scratching me on accident, slapping my skin) the commonality to any of it is it has to be unexpected, like I don’t know it’s coming. The level of rage I feel at those moments seems so psycho, and it happens so fast idk why I’m like that. I hate that I react super angrily to that sort of stimuli but I don’t feel I have control of it, it’s an instantaneous reaction of rage. Is this an autism thing? Am I just crazy? Is this a trauma response?",

Basically, in order for me to live with this hyperactivity I need to let out the thoughts by talking a lot and by having an organised schedule in mind. Also, I feel constantly aware of my thought process and am very analytical which makes me feel derealised all the time.\nNow, my main outlet (aside from my therapist, my family, my art etc...) was my best friend/boyfriend but he broke up with me last week. And basically it's as if during the time we were together he kept me company as I was driving my train and it made me feel more calm. So, I basically forgot I am indeed very very fast and active in my brain and now that he's not here I am overwhelmed by my own train. I have trouble sleeping and am constantly thinking about something and seeking external stimuli. I tried talking to other people I know but I feel like in order for my mind to be calm it needs to focus on something constant. And now that the constant isn't here anymore I am at a lost. \n\nI know no one can tell me if I am autistic or adhd on here, and it's likely that I am just experiencing something \"\"normal\"\" and just want to feel special (but I am pretty sure that's my imposter syndrome talking though).\nI don't know if this is the right sub to post this but I am gonna try anyway to see if you can relate to what I am saying. I am not diagnosed with autism nor adhd but highly relate to many experiences. But my therapist of 2 years told me I couldn't be autistic because I'm empathetic and not cold.

I'm also aware there is a *lot* of overlap of symptoms. \n\nI began wondering if I was autistic some number of months ago, brought it up with my therapist, and have seen two psychiatrists since trying to get diagnosed. The first just accused me of being intelligent and wanted to attribute all of my issues to that; the second, after meeting me in person, said she would never diagnose me with autism because I am too skillful at emoting, interpreting emotions, and managing conversations. She suggested that she did think I might have Schizoid Personality Disorder, which I'd never heard of, and gave me a new bunny trail to research.\n\nA lot of online screening tools I've used peg me as autistic; I've kind of treated the RAADS-R as what I understood to be the most modern and scientifically rigorous, and I score 135 on that (130 is the mean score for autistic people; higher is more certainly autistic, lower is more likely allistic). However, I've started questioning the accuracy of such tools since learning about Schizoid PD.\n\nMy research turned up this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/t724mu/schizoid\\_pd\\_vs\\_autism/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/t724mu/schizoid_pd_vs_autism/) and I identify more with both the exclusively SPD and exclusively Austistic traits than I do with the overlapping traits (4/6 and 3/5 compared to 4/9 for shared traits). Based purely on descriptions of SPD I feel like that might be a more accurate label for my own neurodiverse flavor, but ultimately I think I'm probably some level of both, leaning more schizoid. I'm also undiagnosed ADHD, but not questioning about that, I just know anyone who says I am not is wrong.\n\nWhat I'm really looking for, though, is to have a better understanding of myself. I don't want to inappropriately claim Autism if I am not, and same with Schizoid; I just want to know what is most accurate to label myself, and how I can best identify without misappropriating anything.",

        "text": "So I’m waiting to get evaluated because I’m pretty sure I’m experiencing autistic burnout. My partner is super loving and supports me and even got me noise cancelling headphones a few months ago when my sensory issues got pretty intense. \n\nAlthough I’ve been pretty up front with them about a lot of what I’m experiencing there are so many things I know I can’t explain or they don’t or won’t get. They also have ADHD so sometimes they’ll forget how sensitive I am right now and do things that before I could tolerate but now just messes me up and I become completely overwhelmed. \n\nAnyways they followed me in the kitchen the other day and were being super loving but as usual I was on the verge of a shutdown. I know I should have just said that but it seems like I’m always near that threshold now and I’ve noticed that the more I say it the less it means to the people around me. Again they’re super supportive just struggling to understand.  They started flirting and was playing around by physically touching me and because I was facing away didn’t see how little I liked it. I suddenly couldn’t speak and they kept doing it and it was pressing me into the counter where the lights are and they were talking and I lost it and kept shouting “stop.” This happened a lot as a kid but never before as an adult and it’s really disconcerting.\n\nI feel so bad because that’s not like abnormal for them to do that and they of course immediately stopped but also ran away. Later they said I was really aggressive and I was angry at them so they thought they should give me space to re regulate myself which I appreciated.  When I tried to explain I wasn’t angry  at THEM just totally overwhelmed they still didn’t understand that it wasn’t THEM. I apologized a lot but they didn’t want to “dwell” on it except they acted so hurt  for a while after.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this? Or any advice on explaining why that happens better? I don’t want them to think they can’t do that with me any more at all because again, that’s normal for us. I just struggle to communicate what actually happens in those moments or how it feels when someone you love runs away from you.",

I've done a lot of reachears and think that what I'm experingsin fits the spektrum quite well, but also not. \nI got a lot of symtoms but i got like this nagging feeling that i'm just overreacting and i feel like not all om my symtoms point to autism. \nWhat feeds my imposter syndrome lile feelings is that many of the symtoms that i am notesin have come later and wasent at all there when i was a kid, alltough some of the traits have i had cince childhood.\nI'm thinking about getting checked, but i'm really afraid of getting told that i'm overaccting or getting told that its just my GAD or depressing ( that i think i got missdianosed with instead of ASD) \nI got these diagnoses when i was 12 and bullid in school.\n\nI've also done online test (ik that they ofen aren trustworty) and the test seem to tell me that i'm most likely on the spektrum.\n\nSo this is what i'm experining (tho i'm not 100% sure it's all symtoms of Atuism)\n\nWhat i had as a kid and still have is diffeculty understanding ppl true intentions even in daycare i recall ofen gettig mistreated, foold or \"used\" ( like in using me just to leave with all the cleaning, or change the rules is tag so that i was always the tagger) and i dident notice this until like a few years back.\nI had a bed realationship with my dad and stepmom. They mentaly abust me for years before they cut contact but as a kid i never ever tought about telling my mom\n\nI had issues with soem foods and cloting. Witch i still have. For exampel i cant eat fish. The texture is so overwheling and it made me puke and have meltown when my parent made me eat it. Today i am an vegetrtian for many reasons but also beacuae i cant stand the texture. I also had to hade my shose too small or tie that so hard that the sholace broke otherwise i'd have a meltdown and throw the shose away ( i still get meltdowns if my shose arent right) and socks. Always inside out. Cant stand the seems and if there twisted or just feel wrong i get a meltdown.\n\nThis wasent a problem as i child but now i cant be in a crowded room or a loud one whitout having an panic attack or zoonkng out compleatly and figeting in all ways to distract myself. Like on break in school i ofen have to go to an isolated place bc i get so overwhlemd.\n\n I dont like showering beacuase i feel like every raindrop and its too hot and the air gets bad with is so overwheling that i ofen have to take long brakes ever for a short shower.\n\n\nAs i child i had an obbsession with MLP it was the only show and toys i liked, and i gad almost every toy and i loved talking about it in every convo. Now i dont really have an obbsesion like horror games or horror animes will get me obbsest for a few month being all i want to do but after i while it fades.\n\nAs a kid and now i've always been super naive, and never been able to lie. As a kid i ofen dident understand jokes at all or irony wich i still really struggel wich but now i also have a hard time understanding when i should talk, what to say i ofen overtign ehat to say in my head amd overanyise pepelts reactions and or faces. I ofen gossiping on acredent i a way. Oversharing and saying thing at a bad time.\nPeople ofen tell me that im bring inpolite or that my tone of voice is wrong like sounding hadde when im serius och angry then trying to sound calm, they also say i make weird faces and i find it really hard to udnerstand and controll my face and tone in voice.\n\nPeople also tell me that i always bring the convo back to myself and beeing nassesitc beacuse when trying to show sympaty i ofen answer with my own story or extreriens. I dont mean to sound worse or make someone fell less valid i'm just trying to realate.\n\nAs a kid i had \"a heart of gold\" i feel emotions really strongly, both my own ans others. Like if i se a sad characer in a game och show i can cry for hours becuase i can really feel what there feeling. Its so bad that i can hade a hard time getting out of others shose like im ALWAYS it sombody elses shose.\nI've read that being this sensetive and emethatic can be a sign of Atism i still feel like its steropypical Atusim to have a hard time understaing others wich makes me feel invalid.\n\nBeing social is really tiering, after school i need to be compleatly allne the reat of the day and i have to have \"rest days\" in bretween socal events ehere im at home not doing anyting. I get super exitet when i know i dont have to do anyting the next day and worry a lot about future evets as ordering food or telling the hair staylist how i want my hair. I overanalise ever littel deatail about myself in a grup feeling like im preforming or being watched trying to do everyting right.\nThe thing woth eye contact is 50/50 for me. If in liseing to somebody talk i often stare like stare in the persons eyes. But if im taliking or thinking i cant hold eyecontact at all.\nI also love inspecting and watching ppls patterns or beahvors for a far. Inspecting and looking. And often fins myself starring at someone.\nI get very tired and confused when in large gruups pf people för longer times and get very mad and irritated.\nThis wasent a problem before but the last like 3 years i get really upset if my rutins get shaken up. For exampel \nMy teathers know not to change my seat beacuse i'll just refuse to sitt down and that the days after a new seatingcart (even if im in the same seat) i'll br really senstiv and irritated. I also ofen trun down plans with friends beacuse for ecampel on tuesdags and thursdays i have to go home afer school for alone time (or to study) and i refuse to do someting else beacuase i'm always home resting, or how i have to get ready the same exact time inte the exact Time every day \n\nI stim a lot too, whan im thinking or an overwhlemd like touting my hands flapping my hands, shaking my head, swinging form side to side shaing my legs, blinking fast, finger tapping and reapting a word or huming, a also get a twich where my head goes to my left shoulder.\n\nI dont really obbses over numbers but i move song lyric and rytm, remembering and studing lycks to song. I ever got a notebook full of song lyrics.\n\nI really dont know if this han anyting to do witch Atuism. but i've dated a lot in my life. And have no problem with intimity or flirting. It's ofen hard to know how much to text or talk and when you're to much. In past reletion ships i've ofen been told that i dont care veasuce i dont text or call or that im anoying and texinga and wanting to talk all the timd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdk if i missed anyting. If you have a questing i'll glady anser. (I'm really sorry for my terrible inglish btw)\n\nAlso i know you cant tell me if im Atistic or not. And i dont need to know that. I can go get checed myself.\nIg i just want som validation to ease this imposter syndrome\nAnd if it's normal thst some Atusic traits come later and wasent present from childhood. And if you still can be Atistic if you feel extremly much and understand how others feel easely. \n\nIf you got this far thank you so much for the help. God bless you",

All autism tests I did online say very likely neurotypical and I’ll admit that fueled by fear I’ve done them countless times and each time it was the same result.\n\nI struggled just as much as the people on Reddit spoke about in terms of friendships, but autism both makes and doesn’t make sense in my situation (if that makes any sense lol)\n\nAnyways, I met a guy in grad school who I complained about to friends because he was difficult to work with, and a friend told me he had Asperger’s which made me realize that I see some aspects of myself in him, then a friend told me I act like Abed from community and that made me say okay I definitely am autistic.\n\nBut my biggest concern is the whole social cue thing, like I never even knew there was a word for it until I read about it and I don’t feel like I have this whole “if this then that” method, but now I feel like maybe there’s a whole world out there that I wasn’t aware of and it’s making me question everything.\n\nWere you guys aware early on that you were missing something, or was it like an “Aha!” moment you figured out later on in your life? I genuinely don’t know if I am missing social cues or not and I haven’t been able to tell.",

Among many other negative effects, this has caused an inability to focus and a complete loss of motivation that affects everything from eating to working.\n\nHowever, I've found that when I take Ambien (for insomnia), it will frequently give me a surge of motivation and restore my ability to plan and focus. There have been occasions where I've gotten out of bed after taking it and hammered out stuff I'd been struggling with for weeks or months in a few hours. Or I'll suddenly have the urge to exercise, with the intent to keep it up, but falling back into hopelessness and depression the next morning.\n\nI think I have some partial idea of why this is happening and what's functionally occurring neurologically, but I haven't heard many other people talk about this.\n\nSo I'm wondering if this is related to autism, just a quirk of my own configuration, or perhaps a reaction to a change in wiring as an indirect result of trauma due to autistic traits.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this?",

        "text": "I recently became aware of the concept that autistic people don’t have theory of mind (idk how true this is) and I have thoughts about it. If I’m understanding what theory of mind is, it’s attributing mental states to ourselves and other people. And I find it really interesting because when I was a kid I had no concept of the fact that people could understand what others are feeling, even in movies I didn’t know that the viewers are meant to realize what a character’s interactions are. Unless a character was crying or having an otherwise extreme display of emotions or just directly saying that they are sad I wouldn’t even know I was supposed to understand what they are feeling or what they are trying to do. But I distinctly remember watching Hunter x Hunter and reading the promised never land and being fascinated by how the characters would try to figure out other characters intentions and in really clever but indirect ways, and trying to do that in real life. I don’t know if this makes sense but it feels like I never thought about anything before that, I obviously had thoughts in my head, but I think it was just that nothing ever made sense and it felt so impossible to understand that I had stopped trying and questioning anything, and then I started doing it again. I’m still way off in the conclusions I reach sometimes though. I also got really into film analysis, especially when they are about the character writing and kind of started understanding what I should look at to understand what the characters think like, what they are going to do etc. which has helped me understand people in real life more, even though tv people still make way more sense (if they are written well) since they follow patterns, and a lot of the times you can tell what their intentions are based on what the plot wants them to do, there’s also music cues, scenes of moments you wouldn’t see people in real life in, and you have more time to process things and more objectivity. \nI’m not sure if I am autistic, I’m trying to get a diagnosis. But this leaves me with questions. Can you not have theory of mind and then develop it? Does that mean I’m not autistic? Also is the not having theory of mind concept even accurate? \nAnyway, sorry this was long and probably makes no sense",

The older sister said it was also something her Mom believed. I asked her to consider next time she thought her sister was just looking for attention to maybe try and give her some attention that she appreciates. The older sister has started doing this, bit by bit.\n\nI haven't shared my autism diagnosis with my larger family, but now I'm considering doing this so that I could maybe help my little cousin who seems like she is misunderstood in her family.\n\nAnyway, this seemed like an incredible act of bravery to me tonight and I am so proud!\n\n(For the record, I know that my cousins' parents love her very much and are doing everything they know how to get her the best help possible. They've paid for surgeries, physical therapy, speech therapy and one on one tutoring to help her learn to read when she wasn't keeping up at school. They adore her, I think she is just so different from the parents and the two older children that they sometimes struggle to identify how they should treat her differently to respect her emotional needs.)",

I was with my sisters families the whole weekend and didn’t get much down time.\n\nSo I come into work today and I felt… slow? I had customers repeat orders a lot because I feel like my mind didn’t hear it right the first time and I’d look down and wonder what buttons to push even though I’d just heard it.\nIt also felt at times like I was watching my body and mind work things out but couldn’t… participate if that makes sense? Like the separated body and thinking outside my control.\nI also felt on edge, like I was thinking up ways someone might snap at me. Or ways I’d screw up.\nI can’t recall a time I’ve felt like this before. And it bothers me work noticed. I’m glad they we’re understanding this time but I don’t know if that’ll always be the case?\nWas I shutting down? Meltdown? Disassociating? Please help me make sense of this.",

I know for certain that I have SPD, and a lot of things are triggering for me.\n\nSome loud sounds are terrible, and I sometimes feel overwhelmed to the point where I just shut down and feel exhausted. I am very jumpy, and am known to shriek whenever I get startled.\n\nI feel horrible with certain textures, and I can't wear socks without having to inside-out them. Clothes that aren't baggy feel uncomfortable, and I have to seam rip tags off of some clothes.\n\nI feel as if I don't get social ques sometimes, and I'll hear someone say something and I'll have no idea what they mean.\n\nIf there's background noise, I won't be able to hear what my friends are saying at all. I have to ask my friends multiple times to releat themsleves, and sometimes I just give up and pretend I heard what they said. I prefer texting/emailing or in person communication compared to phone calling brcause I often have a very hard time trying to hear what thr other person is saying.\n\nI've been known to info dump about things I'm really passionate about, and I can literally do that for hours without realizing. I have certain topics or things that I absolutely love to the point where I'll be grinning at the mere mention of it.\n\nI stim a lot whenever I'm nervous, stressed, anxious, really happy, exciting, etc. I'll flap my hands or shake them or tap on myself, and sometimes I'll do little verbal stims like whistling or making clicking noises. Sometimes whenever I'm feeling really bad, I'll accidentally find myself punching my knuckles together or hitting my leg and won't realize it until I accidentally hurt myself.\n\nGosh, this post is a mess. Sorry about the little rant or whatever this is. But yeah, I don't know if what I'm describing is just my SPD or something more. I have a feeling it's something else, but then again, I dont know.\n\nThank you for your time, and I apologize if this isn't the right place to put this ^^",

        "text": "I hardly passed the test (I'm not sure what it's called, but I'm in the US and scored a 7, the minimum grade for an ASD diagnosis), but autism certainly is part of my identity, and people can tell I'm autistic even when I'm posting about unrelated topics, even just by my writing style and word-choice.  And I have trouble in social situations and often don't understand why people do certain things, such as say, \"Excuse me,\" and expect me to understand what they're asking me to do when the phrase has at least five definitions.  And of course I have the sensory issues, mostly in the mornings. \n\nBut when I'm hanging out with friends who scored higher on the test than me, they'll do things that take me by surprise sometimes as well, such as sitting really close to strangers or abruptly leaving the room mid-conversation (and it's weird the last one surprises me because I do it, too.)\n\nSo basically, if someone is lower on the spectrum than me, I feel autistic, but if someone is higher on the spectrum than me, I feel neurotypical.  Of course this sucks because I therefore don't fully fit in with either group, but it's also advantageous because I can better empathize with and understand both because I have traits of each.  This also puts me into a sort of \"translator\" role sometimes, when an autistic friend is asking about something a neurotypical friend did, or vice versa.  \n\nBut there are still times when either will boggle me because again, I'm really just sitting in the middle. Im neuro-hybrid.",

        "text": "As I understand it, cognitive dissonance is the discomfort a person feels when they're presented with information that contradicts their own beliefs. This is why it's so hard to change a person's mind about something they believe, even if they're literally looking at proof their beliefs are wrong. Of course, some people are more prone to this than others and this holds true whether we're talking about autistic or allistic people.\n\nWith that said, I saw autistic people described once as \"Seeing the world for how it is, rather than how it's supposed to be\" and it's got me thinking. While I don't know the validity of this claim either, it does seem to have some truth to it in regard to things like social hierarchies and cultural norms. \n\nTo use myself as an example, I understand that there may be consequences for treating my boss like my equal. In reality I think he is my equal since we're both living beings, but since he controls my paycheck I think I should tread carefully to ensure I continue getting money. If I'm understanding autism correctly, an allistic person is unlikely to view it this way; they'll \"feel out\" the social hierarchy and come to kind of mentally view others as more/less equal to themselves.\n\nAnyway, I'm very curious what you all think. Autism is such a big spectrum that at times it's hard for me to understand what exactly makes us different from allistic people at times. I have no clue if I'm onto something here or not.",
