        "author": "Villeneuve_",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/8pkexq/i_recently_read_the_dystopian_classic_brave_new/",
        "text": "&gt; '*...that is the secret of happiness and virtue ‚Äì liking what you've* got *to do. All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.*'  \n\nI recently finished reading *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley, and it's for me one of those reads that get you into a contemplative mood and stay in the back of your mind long after you have put the book down, refusing to let go and compelling you to toss and turn it over and over in your head.  \n\nIt's been a few years since I read *1984* by George Orwell - another prominent dystopian novel that's often brought up in discussions of *Brave New World* and vice versa - but I distinctly remember feeling this strange mix of unsettlingness and morbid curiosity while reading it due to some of the concepts it delineates and the underlying idea that these could come to pass in practice in the future and may in fact be happening in the present reality. And now while reading *Brave New World*, I felt something similar, but the unsettling feeling was only more intense in this case.  \n\nI gave it some thought and I feel like it's chiefly because, while *1984* presents a totalitarian regime that controls its subjects by means of coercion and perpetual surveillance, *Brave New World* depicts a 'softer form of totalitarianism' - as Margaret Atwood puts it in her introduction to the novel - and yet a highly effective one where people are psychologically conditioned to unquestioningly accept their predetermined functions in society and whatever else is meted out to them in life. It's not merely that they're deprived of any alternatives, but they're also inherently *incapable* of feeling the need for an alternative in the first place. It's one thing to be coerced into a way of life that you *know* you're unhappy with but have seemingly no way to escape from, but it's another thing altogether to have your psyche be deliberately configured in a way such that not only you don't realise the gravity of your own situation but also you find *satisfaction* in it and can't comprehend the idea of anything outside of it.  \n\nEssentially, the very concept of free will is done away with. This is a world where one's role and functions in society, their preferences and inclinations, and their dominant personalities, attitudes, outlooks, and quirks are all predetermined at the stage of one's conception, and then later reinforced through a series of systematic behavioural conditioning sessions to the effect that these become synonymous with what we call instincts ('As if one believed anything by instinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.'). No one really has the choice to *explore* and decide for themselves what they want or do not want, not because they're being held at gun point but because they've been *programmed* to be content with the existing state of affairs to the extent of never wanting to consider having things any other way (and when any glitch in the form of overwhelming emotions or deviating thoughts pops up, it's promptly terminated with a dose of *soma*). Neil Postman put it succinctly in *Amusing Ourselves to Death*: 'What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one'.  \n\nAnd to me, from a third-person perspective that lies outside the system of this world, such a scenario is terrifying and tragic.  \n\nThis realisation hit me like a truck when at one point towards the end of the novel, the Savage - John - attempts to incite the lower-caste Deltas into rebellion against their subservient way of life and against *soma*-intake as the society's legally sanctioned means to quell any emotion deemed undesirable, but in vain. The Savage's emotionally-charged words fall on deaf ears as the Deltas have been deliberately engineered to possess inferior mental faculty, rendering them incapable of comprehending anything outside the requirements of their menial jobs. The mental image of hundreds of Deltas and Epsilons with indistinguishable faces filing in and out of elevators and going about their monotonous jobs (which, owing to their conditioning, they don't find so) reminded me of the Hands - the factory workers who have been dehumanised and reduced to only a pair of hands by their capitalist maters - in Charles Dickens' *Hard Times*. But while the Hands are at least *aware* of their circumstances and how these circumstances affect them even if they can't do anything about it, the common masses of the World State are bereft of even the luxury of self-awareness.   \n\nThat being said, perhaps the true ingenuity of *Brave New World* lies in the author's ability to simultaneously convince the reader of the appeal and upsides of the book's universe for those who inhabit it specifically and also in general terms, while also conveying this lingering feeling of there being something very wrong with this world - walking the fine line between utopia and dystopia.   \n\nA well-crafted dystopia is one that expertly wears the garb of a utopia, and the World State certainly passes this test with flying colours for the champions of this society do make some sound arguments in its defense, and one almost wants to *believe* them. For instance, they do have a point in that a great deal of misery in life often stems from dissatisfaction with one's obligations - their jobs, responsibilities, and roles - but if people are made to like what they've got to do, then there's no scope for dissatisfaction in the first place, and it follows then that everyone's happy with their life. At one level, it sounds convincing enough. Rather than having a bunch of unhappy employees slaving away at their workstations, wouldn't it be a more desirable situation to have these employees be conditioned in a way such that they find the work pleasant? The employer wants to get work done and the employees are always happy to do it, regardless of the nature of the work. That makes it a win-win situation for both the employer and the employees.   \n\nAnd *yet*, there's something about this whole thing that feels wrong deep down.   \n\nAs far as my understanding goes, it's because the implication of such an arrangement is that people are being stripped off their free will and power to make informed choices. As humans, we're distinct from other animals in our self-awareness and intelligence, and in a way that's both a blessing and a curse. By taking away the power to think and explore and take decisions for *ourselves*, and limiting us to a set of predetermined configurations, we're in effect being deprived of what makes us *human*.   \n\nThe people of World State have paid their price for 'happiness and stability'. Do *we* want to? It's not quite a black-and-white picture, and this ambivalence is what makes *Brave New World* so utterly intriguing and thought-provoking.  \n\n*****  \n\nWhat do you think? I'd like to hear your thoughts on this as well as other themes/aspects of the book!  ",
