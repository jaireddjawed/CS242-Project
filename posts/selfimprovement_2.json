        "text": "I have always tried to better myself and thought that thinking would be enough but I had to go through a heartbreaking event to notice my flaws and grow. This is how I started writing my diary.\n\nAt first, I didn't think that writing things down would make that much of a difference. But as I started to incorporate journaling into my daily routine, I quickly realized just how powerful it could be.\n\nOne of the biggest benefits of journaling is that it helps to reinforce important details and events in your memory. When you write something down, you're more likely to remember it later on. This has been especially helpful for me when it comes to remembering important things and stuff that i have already processed.\n\nBut journaling isn't just about remembering things. It's also a powerful tool for reflection. I like to use my journal to write down my thoughts and feelings about different situations. By taking the time to reflect on my experiences, I'm able to gain a deeper understanding of myself and my emotions.\n\nHere's my approach to journaling:\n\n1. Write down what happened during the day: I start by writing down a brief summary of what happened during the day. This could be anything from a meeting at work to a conversation with a friend. Even just that the glass had dropped and got broken. Everything can be written.\n2. Record how I felt: Next, I record how I felt about the situation. Did it make me happy? Sad? Happy? This helps me to identify my emotions and understand why I felt the way I did.\n3. Reflect on the day: At the end of the day, I like to read through what I've written and reflect on my experiences. I ask myself two questions: Did the day go the way I wanted it to? What do I want to happen in the future? Answering this two questions helps me to identify problems early on and think about the solution for the future, to never encounter them again.\n\nI've been using this approach to journaling for a while now, and it's made a significant difference in my life. It's helped me to remember important details and events, as well as gain a deeper understanding of myself and my emotions. And with the help of my journaling app, I'm able to easily keep track of everything in one place.\n\nIf you're looking for a way to improve your memory and gain a deeper understanding of yourself, I highly recommend giving journaling a try. It may seem daunting at first, but the benefits are truly worth it.",

I still have an idea of what needs to be done and by what time. I stopped planning my day down to the minute. \n\nI understand that not everything can go as planned. There will be interruptions throughout the day that just make following your plan impossible. \n\n**So, instead, allow yourself some breathing room throughout your day to do stuff you enjoy and for stuff that unexpectedly happens.**",

I am fundamentally socially awkward fucking loser and that will never change. My roommate literally has dropped out of college has a room so dirty you cannot even see the floor and treats women like fucking garbage and they fucking love him.

More like maybe one will settle for you eventually to have a miserable sexless relationship based around kids. Just like my parents!\n\nEvery time I ask somebody out it only leads to fucking pain and humiliation. The last three girls have gone as follows, one made me buy her alcohol because she was 19 she then sent me a picture of her drinking it with another guy and blocked me, then next one laughed at me and called me awkward she is very nice and did not mean to hurt me but it still did. The last one has been the one that finally broke me. Fucking took her too a bar and then when she got drunk she told me I seemed cool now but that I had the mannerisms of a school shooter/ incel. She asked me if I wanted to date her and when I lied and said no she thanked god. She also asked me when was the last time I had a girlfriend and had sex and I also lied and said freshmen year of high school and over a year ago. She told me honestly how bad that was. Little did she know I was fucking lying and both were neither. Then I got sit there like a dickless idiot and listen to her tell kinky stories about what she did with other guys. She told me about how she had a spontaneous threesome with a dude off bumble and his ex girlfriend when she lived in Sweden.There are men out there good enough to get two fucking women and the same time and I cant even get one. Worst part is I went home and jacked off to the story afterwards. I fucking hated myself so much afterwards I started cutting myself. I punched myself so hard in the head I think I might have broke my wrist. I hate myself so fucking much. I know im fucking weird and socially awkward. Growing up on a farm with only your abusive parents who wish you never existed and no siblings for the first 19 years of life will do that too you. On top of being bullied in school!!!.\n\nNobody will probably read this fucking pathetic fucking post. I bought what I need to kill myself yesterday.

        "text": " TLDR: I dont want to get into friendships or relationships because I have been hurt a lot in the past and I tend to isolate myself, and its driving me crazier by the day.\n\nI (23F) have had social anxiety for as long as I remember. I was so cheerful and full of ideas as a kid, but between being bullied by my classmates and neglected by my (well meaning but busy) parents and teachers, I developed social anxiety and was very scared of others. I have had very few friends growing up, and most of them were toxic. One who affected me a lot was my best friend for some time but things got really toxic between us, and she gaslit me into thinking I was the reason she was treating me so badly. It was borderline abusive. The guys I've dated were the same, they were all emotionally unavailable and gave me breadcrumbs, making me feel like I am too much.\n\nNow, I have been working on myself and going to therapy, and I can recognize a lot of patterns in my past. However, I am unable to progress to the next stage. I can't talk to people or make new friends or date, because I was traumatized by friends and exes, and I am afraid to let anyone close. I am afraid even to talk to people on a surface level, even to my classmates or my neighbours. It is driving me crazy every day to spend all my free time in my room, only stepping out for classes and groceries. I have decent social skills but nowhere to use them. I could go out to events where I know no one, like extracurricular events in my uni but it gets too overwhelming to get started even. Sometimes it is just easier to slip into my maladaptive daydreams and stay in my room.\n\nI recognize that this is unhealthy. I'm just not sure how to proceed. I feel really lonely and I try to block it out by scrolling or youtube, and now my studies and work are being compromised. I try getting into a routine every day but I can't. I always wake up late, just in time for class and come home exhausted. And my sleep cycle and my diet is bad. I am cooking for myself for the first time, and it is very overwhelming. It is hard to deal with all of this at the same time.\n\nThank you so much for reading until the end. I am a good person and I am trying to be the best I can, but I am not able to heal or progress beyond recognizing these patterns. Please let me know if you have any advice. Or any points of view. Would really appreciate it.",

        "text": "I wasn't sure where to post this to look for some peoples thoughts, hopefully this is an okay place to do it. I want to note, I'm pretty sure I'm depressed but am not in any danger of hurting myself or something serious.  It's not debilitating but the ongoing feel of it is starting to grind me down. \n\n**TLDR:** I moved and between a mix of loneliness, nature of my job, and my ADHD (maybe?) I feel mildly depressed constantly and like I'm just spinning my wheels and doing the bare minimum most days. I've had a healthy balance of in person and online socializing, work, and gym time in the past and I want that back. However, without big solutions like moving, or some kind of miracle solution I don't know what to really do. \n\n**How can I meet people and make friends and maintain a consistent schedule after moving somewhere new?**\n\n**Longer explanation and details:** \n\nI moved back in July for a job after finishing grad school. Overall the job is great (pay is meh but the bennies are great and its very low stress and in my field), but I'm struggling. I'm doing okay at work, but moving after moving to this small town, I feel like I'm just not motivated to do a whole lot of anything beyond the minimum. \n\nI got really into going to the gym in the last few years and shedding about 100lbs, but after being used to using gyms that had better hours and I went to with friends, I've struggled to go to this one. I can't keep a regular schedule when its entirely dependent on me, and the system that worked for me previously (going with friends, or going really late at night) doesn't work here as the gym closes at 8 on weeknights and 3pm on weekends. Closest alternative gyms are about 20 minutes away vs across the street from my apartment. I've maintained my weight and during the field season get some activity in, and kept eating healthy but I've lost a lot of muscle definition. \n\nWork has been a struggle. Not to do what I need to do, but my boss is in a major city an hour away and my daily schedule is entirely self determined for 90% of the time. For some this is amazing but for a person who works best with schedules and deadlines and external pressures (think missing points on assignments in school or a boss being mad for you being late), this setup is really rough on my ADHD. This is doubled with the fact that I have no coworkers out of my office, minus one who is here once a week. The rest of my coworkers are either at HQ or other sites, so I'm alone 90% of the time. \n\nHonestly the biggest issue though is I am lonely. No one ever warned me how hard it is to meet people in your 20's. Double that for moving to a small town that's mostly families and elderly people. I had some sporadic luck in dating throughout my time here, but that's been dry lately. More-so than dating though, is the fact I haven't been able to find a way to make friends here. I have several friend groups who I love but they are spread out and clustered in cities 2-4 hours away, or in other states. This has led to me spending a ludicrous amount of time at my computer playing games with friends and hanging out on Discord. I'm not really an extrovert, but I like hanging out with my friends once or twice a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems as simple as meet people and workout more and set a schedule but for anyone with severe enough ADHD, it's never that simple. I don't necessarily want to change jobs right now but at the same time moving might be the best option if I can't figure something else out.",

        "text": "So, I'm a 28 (almost 29) year old woman who has always had jealousy of other women, especially women I'm friends with. From the time I was 16 until a few months back I have also been an intense alcoholic. I've treated my body, mind, and spirit like shit for most of my life. I am very overweight and not at all where I want to be on the attractive scale but I am now actively on a weight loss and sobriety journey. \n\nThe first person I was truly jealous of is my best friend. I won't get into why but it was/is hard to let go of. With my new sobriety I have been trying to dig deep, become better, come from a place of humility and prioritize my health in all ways. \n\nI'm thankful for my work family because we're all really close and they have helped me really believe that I can become who I want to be. Last December my new work friend was hired and we instantly hit it off. We have very similar spiritual beliefs, music tastes, we can talk for hours. She is a really beautiful person inside and out. And at first I didn't feel any jealousy, just enjoyment getting to know her. As I've continued hanging out with her I have noticed that she...hmmm...I don't know if I want to say \"brags\" but it feels like she brags quite often. She mentions all the places she's been and all the celebrities she's seen/met, and just kind of reiterates how much she has done. Which isn't really bad, I'm not saying that, I guess it just gets to be a bit much sometimes, but that didn't really bother me as much as this one thing is. \n\nOf course it's a guy that likes her instead of me. \n\nThis guy has been coming to the place we work for a long time, he delivers stuff to us. I've always thought he was attractive and just an amazing person in general.  We talked briefly a few times and I really wanted to get to know him more. Over the past few weeks my schedule has changed and I haven't really seen him, then I get to work and she is talking about what an amazing time she had with him a week or so ago and he comes in and they're hugging and giggling and you can just tell they really like each other. To make it harder, my co workers wouldn't shut up about how great they look together. I was just standing there, trying to focus on work and not cry. Then later after work I was hanging out with her and other co workers and she mentioned how amazing he is and I just said \"Yep, he's pretty cool.\" I figured that she might be able to read the energy in my statement? I dunno.\n\nI know he isn't my boyfriend, nor is he someone I probably ever had a chance in dating but it just kind of gets to me after a while. Why does it seem like my lady friends always have to rub it in my face about how much guys like them? Trust me, I get it. Over and over and over again I get it and I'm not trying to be bitter, but why should I have to just be silent about something that makes me sad? At least I feel like I have to be silent to not rock the boat or seem like an unsupportive friend. \n\nI know it'll take time and continuous work for me to be as attractive as my friends but it hurts. Never being chosen hurts. \n\nWhat do I do when these feelings come up? How do I say this hurts me in a loving way? I don't want to ruin a friendship and I also don't want her to feel like she can't share things with me.",

Chances are not looking good for me to find a girlfriend because I don’t stay after school for clubs or anything, I live over an hour away, I have so much coursework that I don’t have time and the social culture of my school is more individualistic then collective. I am on a path right now to improving my life by working out everyday and organizing my day-to-day tasks as well that I complete, so I’m always busy with something. However, my social life is quite subpar and I don’t hangout with anyone outside of school because the friends I had from high school did not retain. \n\nIm worried that once I graduate from school,  this chapter of my life is gonna suffer so much.

Since COVID and the intensifying negativity in the world at large, I have been on a mission to find a way to help the most amount of people regain some semblance of happiness in their worlds. Recently, I came across Barbara Fredrickson's book called Positivity, where I learned that a 3 to 1 positive to negative thought ratio is the tipping point for people to live happier and more resilient lives. The idea is that when we're more positive than negative, our perspectives are broader and we can see more ways to a goal or around an obstacle. Negativity narrows our focus - rightfully so when we are actually in danger. The problem is, we're not in as much danger as we tend to think, but by giving into negative thought patterns, we're limiting ourselves from seeing the various possibilities that are out there.\n\nAccording to Fredrickson, 80% of people fall below the 3:1 positive to negative thought ratio. I'm doing some research in my efforts to develop a program that will help people convert negative thought patterns into positive ones so they can more easily achieve happiness.

Since I live in middle east I can't have a part time job, but I have worked a few times voluntarily, now my dad can get me a job through his friends but he is saying first complete your studies and then work and my education is another mess. Firstly I was studying at a school and then had to leave it due financial issues and then after 2 complete years I completed my studies at age 19 privately and this I will my uni after completing 1 foundation year and graduate at the age of 25, till then I can't accomplish anything I have tried learning skills online but couldn't focus and my mental health is fucked because of all this. My parents are very overprotective of me controlling everything in my life, I have to siblings and they don't any of that shit with them only with me.\nIf anybody relates with me tell me what should I do, I'm really going crazy now and started to hating my parents and seeing them as villains",

        "text": "I absolutely love art and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's literally a part of my soul.  I'll be honest, art is one of the few things I feel like I'm good at.  I've never been super intelligent or skilled, but I know I can make people happy with my art, which is why I've made it my goal in life to make art all the time.  I went to college to become an animator, but due to various reasons, I haven't entered the field yet and instead have worked an outside job and buffed my art skills on the side.\n\nThe only problem is that without school, I've had a seriously tough time finishing my own art projects.  I have tons of ideas, but I have the tendancy to overthink everything and take so much time that I burn myself out and abandon projects, which would then burden me while working on any following projects.  This has even made it difficult to work on bigger, more time-consuming projects like animations, which is a problem when I need to fill a portfolio with projects if I ever want a job in that field.\n\nLast night, I was watching a video and a guy was talking about this \"improvement in painting\" graph and relating it to something he was doing.  The graph basically showed that every artist will hit points throughout their project where they'll become frustrated because they don't know what to do at that moment.  But the more they learn and push through those feelings, the more they can continue to grow.  They'll of course hit that feeling again, but by that point, they would have already progressed a lot from when they last felt that.  It kind of resonated with me a bit and today I thought about it some more and how I want to learn how to overcome those moments.  I think my biggest problem is that I don't have enough motivation to push me past these moments.  I used to have deadlines for school projects to keep me going, but now I'm not bound by things like that anymore and don't know how else to do that.  I thought about posting my art on social media, but when the art isn't really noticed, I lose motivation again.  So I want to find a better way of doing it.  Maybe a place online where my art can actually be seen, critiqued, or commented on.  I also want to figure out how I can stop overthinking my art so that I don't burn myself out so often.  Perfectionism has always been a problem for me and I don't know how to tone it down more.\n\nAs of now, I'm only able to finish maybe 3 or 4 projects each year out of maybe 15 or more I would start on.  That's not even including ideas I've either had or sketched out but never went further because I didn't feel confident enough to work on them.  This year, I want to push myself to finish at least 10 projects and I need advice on how I can get that goal.  Please help?",

I worked as a mechanic for Mercedes for a long time but decided enough was enough of consistently struggling with the way i was paid and all in all destroying my body for no gain. I have aches a 26 year old should not have. Im also exhausted mentally all the time and cant seem to get enough rest even when i sleep 8 hours or more. My wife is lovely, she works hard, and is in school as well. \n\nhaving said all of that- i went back to community college to try to get into the nursing program. im so close. I messed up and am now having to withdraw from my last course before the program.  Im having a hard time remaining disciplined in studying when i have a million different worries. Almost like anxiety. when i study i can read the material but not actually retain it because my minds thinking about whether or not the bills are going to be paid, kids crying for something, or if the kids are behaving, parents needing me for something, or my parents want to go do something when i need to study so i cant study. \n\nMy wife has taken over working full time so i can try to get my life back on track as of late. Having said that, im now home all day with the kids (which i dont mind) but every need i have now comes in last. My father also is super hard on me about school. Like today, i failed a test because i wasn't allotted time to study and its apparently still my fault. He'll then blame me not studying on any of my hobbies such as motorcross or duck hunting. (every now and then when i need to breath ill take the dirtbike on a loop around the neighborhood. all of 4 minutes) . i just cant do it like i used too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm almost so terrified of failing in life at this point that im frozen in fear. I literally cannot imagine doing a job for the rest of one's life being miserable day in and day out. \n\nWhat am i doing? i dont eat well,  i vape,  i cant sleep, even if i wanted to sleep the kids wont let me. i just cant seem to get it together guys.",

        "text": "Our society places a lot of emphasis on relationships in several different ways.  Oftentimes, this can distract us from the most important one.\n\nThe one we have with ourselves.  It is the only one that you can never walk away from.  You can leave any other relationship in your life.  You can never walk away from yourself.  Sure, you can avoid and suppress it, but it is still there with you.  Ever step, of every day!  \n\nWe get bombarded with messages like, \"You complete me.\"  This can lead people to think they need someone else in order to be complete.  \n\nThat is not true!\n\nIn many ways, we get pushed towards coupling off with others, even at the risk of it being unhealthy.  \"Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.\"  Things like that can have an impact on us.\n\nWhen we take a step back to prioritize ourselves, we get called selfish.  \n\nFalse!\n\nTaking time to ensure we are good.  That we are connected and grounded in ourselves.  Whole and complete without others.  Then and ONLY then are we able to show up in life authentically.  When we do that, it adds MORE value to the other relationships we hold as well.\n\nThat's what self-care/improvement and various methods of cultivating the connection are about.  It is the act of knowing ourselves.  Being in a relationship with ourselves.  This empowers us to show up and participate in life in ways that honor who we are. \n\nPain and suffering is rooted in the disconnection from ourselves!",

Behaviors she exhibits are noticed by all (they are obviously concerning). \n\nI am taking part in a course which asks for public speaking and almost theatrical performances - so all eyes on one person. when we complete the course we will do a lot of public speaking and interaction with an audience. there is a mishmash of people of all ages including a girl of uncertain age - she seems to be less than 25, but judging by her teeth i would say 70. she has a bubbly, childlike energy, smiles a lot and speaks openly (often without thinking it seems, cutting in, even when the teachers is speaking). if you cut off the visual, she is very cool and nice. but here are the problems:  \n\n\nshe has little spatial awareness, often squeezing in between people in a group, standing right in front of someone or slowly edging towards them as if to take their place. it happened so many times i just usually step away and breathe out. when we form a little informal circle to talk, many times she stood right in the middle, with her hair blowing in someones face. \n\nher mouth is usually open and she drools in random moments, sometimes spit shoots out of her mouth when she talks. \n\nive also seen green snot bubbling out of her nose at the same time as saliva bubbled out of her mouth. it was during her speech and we were all looking at her. i had to look away and i assume everyone noticed these things. \n\nshe randomly takes out her sandwiches and eats them, chewing with open mouth, often talking. i just step as far as i can when she does. \n\nshe has a bad posture despite seemingly good shaped body - slouches like an old lady and braces in the hips. this makes me unable to asses her age. \n\nher clothing is always falling off, she corrects it like a child would. although this is an afterthought and by itself acceptable, her hair is blowing wildldy, often covering her eyes so she squints like a creature instead of tying it, sometimes saliva hangs on her fringe. \n\nbasically, this person is a common sight in a kindergarten. but she is an adult and despite earlier comments, she must be in her 20s. she has some social skills and confidence to speak to people, her voice sounds alright and she clearly has interests and knowledge which make her a cool person. \n\nbut those physical quirks i described are visibly revolting to most people in our group - i am nice when she talks to me and so are others but i can read all sorts of hints of discomfort and repulsion. \n\nwe are adults and we meet weekly, nobody has guts or responsibility to tell her. and it's not just one thing, it's so many. i would imagine some kind of stiff \"etiquette class\" would be very helpful. \n\ni understand some of you reading this may get triggered and still call me an asshole. i understand this girl likely survived bullying at school due to all her quirks mentioned. i don't want to bully her and i don't want to change her into some stiff, different person. i tried to imagine her family and upbringing - maybe they just gave up on her as a child? i was always corrected by my grandma or teachers - don't slouch, tie your hair, close your mouth. \n\ni'm not one to get involved in other people's business but i think our class, which prepares us to face the audience, doesn't address at all these seemingly basic life skills such as being presentable. i am afraid she will be rejected by her customers in the future due to her wild child characteristics.",

Reaching out for professional help is in my plans but is a little bit complicated in my health facility right now, so I just wanted to ask for some advice and tips to help me until I get help.\n\nFor quite some time I have been really struggling in the mornings. Right when I wake up I instantly find myself in a bad mood, thinking negative things, dwelling in the past mistakes. At first it didn't really affect me that much. I would get up and get on with my day bouncing back from morning sadness. However lately I started to spend more time in bed after waking up with all this negative feelings. It got to a point where I stopped going to the office and just work from home, but I would still at least get up and go to my desk. Now I take my computer and stay in bed not even doing anything besides saying hi on team group chat, checking emails and then scrolling social media for an hour. \n\nI thought establishing routine would help me but it feels like I'm paralyzed by this bad mood every time. Unfortunately I'm not a person that is strong enough to just power through this. \n\nEventually I bounce back from this and even though I am pretty sad and miserable throughout the day I go to bed with hope, reviewing my goals and dreams, reading my affirmations. It just seems like everyday it's getting harder and harder. \n\nIs there anything I can do right now that would help me?",

Instead, **try making small changes day by day** until you reach your target.\n\nFor example, if I wanted to start reading but haven’t done so for years, I would start with 10 minutes on day one then 15 minutes on day two, etc. I will do this until I reach my goal.\n\n# Your Environment Is Holding You Back\n\nIs it easy for you to start doing that habit you wanted to implement? It should be. **You must make it easy for yourself to get started on it.** Removes steps required. This is what I like to call, removing friction. At the same time, make it harder for yourself to revert to your old habits.\n\nFor example, I moved my Xbox to another room to make it harder for me to play. Adding friction. While at the same time, I bought myself a kindle to incentives reading. Removing friction.\n\n# It Has No Meaning\n\n**Does that habit mean anything to you? Do you want to make that change?** You may need to make the change, but if you don’t truly want it, you won’t do it. You must find meaning behind the change if you want it to stick.\n\nDon’t do it because so and so said so. Make the change because you enjoy doing it and believe it’s good for you.",

Had severe PTSD plus OCD and ADHD. \n\nAlways bail on everything, never finish anything. Pushed all my friends away now I have none. Not had any in years. I get 600ish a month for having severe OCD. Live at home like a loser in my family bedroom. \n\nA couple of years ago I was in a near death experience and I really tried to change. I became a Muslim which I still am. I quit my daily alcohol and cannabis use which was basically to numb the pain. I even got married to a beautiful high earning, kind woman and passed my test so i could drive.\n\nMy marriage lasted a month I pushed her away and divorced her when I couldn't deal with my trauma and didn't want anyone around me. I let some bad experiences with the Muslim population and a bucket load of social anxiety stop me from really making any ties there now I just go to jumaa on fridays. \n\nIve thought about ways to get out of this but there doesn't seem to be any. I hate being a burden to my mother. I hate being a complete fucking mess all the time. The only thing that I think has kept me from killing myself are my daily prayers and islamic lectures i listen to. \n\nMy only option seems to be start something online. I went on 300 job interviews for shitty jobs flipping burgers, cleaning jobs, kitchen jobs, labour jobs, nothing. I have a criminal record for drugs and numerous other things related to fighting while drunk. I was turned down from a place that cleans grease in kitchens for minimum wage. I was turned down for a job where you spray wash shit away from a place that sells shit for fertilizer. I am officially unemployable. \n\nI have been looking at starting an amazon account for awhile but just as I was about to start ive seen shipping prices on everything jump 100%. And the market seems insanely saturated. \n\nI am fat, 5,8 and balding, literally the only thing I have going for me is a very big penis, but ive only had 6 girlfriends in my entire life and even though i was an unemployed loser for most of them, i still got rid of them because being around someone who actually cares about me gives me such self loathing i try and destroy it. \n\nPlease give me some insight on an actual realistic way to fix my life.",

Growing up I was a very quiet child and had to go through therapy in elementary school due to my lack of social skills\n\nAround 14-15 I became super depressed and since then have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, suspected ADHD, OCD tendencies and Borderline tendencies as well. I have a lot of trauma that I don’t want to mention on here but I had a lot of issues growing up and looking back on it now, I feel like the things I do is because of my childhood.\n\nJust recently my boyfriend told me he was done with me after I had another breakdown which involved me opening the car door while the car was moving and jumping out and basically banging on the car. I often feel like I’m misunderstood and I don’t know why I do this. I have very low self esteem, poor impulse control, and trouble managing emotions and communicating in a healthy manner.\n\nI often feel like a child in an adult body and that my brain does not have the necessary skills to work through these emotions. I also become suicidal when I’m overwhelmed with stress. I want to get better and improve. My therapist suggested I continue working on DBT workbook but would like to know what else I can do.",

One of the companies is a leading company in its industry. I have a fit, muscular build. I’m social and outgoing as well and am well liked. Even after this, a couple of my clients treat me like shit but treat my employees well. It goes so far that, I’ve been called an “entitled brat” and “don’t deserve all this” by a client. These clients are some of the top companies in the world. How do I change this?",
