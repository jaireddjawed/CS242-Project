Western society has a childish fear of all state intervention, labeling each of these possible interventions as communist. It's the result of decades of anti-socialist indoctrination driven by the largest propaganda machine history has seen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImplementing UBI in a capitalist society is, at best, extremely optimistic. People prefer to pour millions into state resources for companies, banks, or financial institutions bailouts, rather than implementing any type of social assistance plan for the common people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's why I envision a scenario where resources are poured into the private sector, and companies are the ones who have a large number of employees on their payroll. Paying them just for being on their payroll. A kind of private UBI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I don't think it's the best solution (I would prefer a highly automated or digitized state that distributes its resources among its inhabitants), but I think it's a solution that seems a little more realistic than universal basic income from the state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI listen to your opinions.",

Elon Musk is important for 3 main reasons: His wealth, his mindset/persistence, and his marketing/hype.\n\n\nWealth- this one’s obviously, he just has an unfathomable amount of money.  He could literally fund SpaceX for years on his own if he had to.  \n\nMindset/Persistence-  He takes risks and is persistent.  Just go watch a YouTube video about how close SpaceX was to failing and all the road blocks they ran into.  I feel like many billionaires sit on their money whereas Elon is not afraid to spend and take huge risks.  Not to mention that many people with that much money would be out on a beach somewhere instead of working lol.\n\nMarketing/hype- he is famous and literally owns twitter.  He also commands an army of fanboys that blindly agree with everything he says.  Any product he markets is going to get attention(whether good or bad).\n\n\nHis actions have played a part in advancing electric vehicles significantly and accelerating the global adoption of them.  His actions have also played a part in revolutionizing space travel.  During my internship at NASA a lead engineer said that “SpaceX is the greatest thing to happen to space travel since the Apollo Program”.  And don’t even get me started on Neuralink lol, thats probably the craziest one.",

They could have characters the way they were in books without the need of casting some actor that bears a close resemblance. AI could create a more complex version of video game characters such as Joel and Ellie from the last of us, which could play every scene, even the violent ones. Actors make a lot of money giving their faces to entertainment, but AI characters would always be 100% a company's property, without a private life to gey drunk or committing crimes. They could also manage to have every possible good quality the entertainment industry wants: a good looking face, could perform every script, could cry naturally one second after a happy discourse, could have a good voice tone, could be the best fighters of any martial art, the best pilots of every vehicle; essentially a Matrix character without the drawbacks of real life. A lawyer character could have the best arguments and the most original behavior possible, a character performing a doctor could be an actual doctor performing all the surgical techniques a human actor obviously can't in from of cameras. Movies could have different angles and scenes because scenes would be more realistic. All the adding costs could be backed by less CGI trying to adapt realistic clips into CGI and a less expensive casting.",

This doesn't even have to do with this subreddit. \n\n\nSome people are becoming the textbook definition of Technophobia or being immature/edgy while having meaningless discussions.\n\n\nIt's clear that most people when talk about AI barely have any idea how it even works. \n\n\nIt's no secret that I am into AI and I aspire to become a researcher one day and contribute to the field.\n\n\nEven tho I don't have a degree yet I still feel that people treat AI as a big black box with superhuman capabilities about to steal people's jobs or destroy us as a whole or some random sh*t about big corporations.\n\n\n(OK maybe I am exaggerating a bit, you get what I mean tho)\n\n\n\nHow to solve this mess: Learn more about how AI works. \n\n\nWhether you hate AI or not, it's here to stay. You might as well want to \"Learn your enemy\" if you will.\n\n\nBesides, AI is here to stay. No matter whether or not you agree with me, you cannot deny that learning will do only good. \n\n\nAnd no I am not saying that you have to become an AI expert. But I feel like a bit of an effort learning the insides of how certain models accomplish certain tasks won't hurt either.\n\n\nNow with that in mind I am not undermining potential concerns about AI. A lot of them are quite reasonable actually. And yes there are discussions to be had. And I don't think that discussion here and in general are fruitless.\n\n\nHowever most of the time people end up doing unfalsifiable claims and have bad *reasoning* behind said concerns. And don't get me started with the emotionally loaded arguments. They're what irritates me the most.\n\n\nThis as a result, ends up being an intellectual poop throwing contest that leads to nowhere.\n\n\nIf we want a bright future for everyone, that's what we want to avoid. And the first step is learn what the frick are you talking about.\n\n\nIf we're gonna talk about a future we might as well be informed about what's happening",
