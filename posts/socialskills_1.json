I can tell they are when they call and try to get me to go to events, outings, groups, you name it. They also have interns now and they call me every Monday at 9:30AM to go for walks.\n\nI hate phone calls, receiving calls, voice messages and being on the phone (even for a second...) with these people. \n\nI've been through a lot and I just moved here a few months ago but I'm over it. They have a resume workshop tomorrow and even their flyers annoy me. \n\nWhy can't I be comfortable in a room I pay rent for? I feel like I'm being targeted. I do think somewhat my feelings of being overwhelmed have a bit to do with my mental health issues. \n\nI feel almost at the end of the rope I'm just not sure anymore what is the point? I keep swatting them like flies I swear and they won't go down! Am I being overly critical? Am I being harsh? I just can't deal with it they call me, belittle me, talk to me in snide manners, they lie to me! \n\nI understand building thicker skin is a commodity these days. And I tell you, 4 months so far I have no thickness overload with all this. I'm shocked actually that I'm not rough or really actually swatting... I know some of this part doesn't make sense. I'm fumbling here. \n\nDo you think these people are getting to me? I mean are they doing all this on purpose? Again with my mental health struggling a bit here I kind of view my thoughts and all this thinking as a drawn out conspiracy theory I have. And I think there is some truth to my conspiracy about the staff here. I mean the way they treat me and they do not care at all that I know when they're lying. I don't call them out and I never directly told them \"leave me alone!\" mostly because they scare me... I don't want to be evicted. I feel like even if I inconvenience them in a minor way they will really comes at me guns blazing. Is this my insecurity? I just don't feel safe :(",

You‚Äôre the MASTER of your own comfort zone.  Nothing or no one understands just how at peace you feel when left alone and you think this is the highest good BUT what this is describing is the biggest cope\n\nThe point of a belief system is to create real world results, this world is here for YOU to create. \n\nThat creative force comes from deep within you, from your SOUL itself. It‚Äôs so innately human to do so - look at how kids play before the adults tell them not to. They build out of sand, blocks, sticks, anything they can get their hands on but it‚Äôs innately human to create. \n\nTHEY call this desire EGO and they believe it‚Äôs wrong \n\nYou decide üëáüëá",

I put my guard up and then I started questioning my guards bc my guard is not the best, so I responded to her normal text from like a day before (I‚Äôm not that good at texting back) that night and no response. \nThen like a week or two later sends me a TikTok laughing. I wasn‚Äôt going to respond fast I was gonna wait till I felt like thinking about her and think of what to say. Well that took a while and I kinda forgot for a day or two, and I didn‚Äôt want to look like I was purposely waiting to long to respond, so I just never did and forgot about it. I didn‚Äôt mean to I wanted to respond. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the ball in my court because my stupid ego won‚Äôt let other people see my emotions for what they are.

A few weeks ago, I went to lunch with a girl in my same program and we had a great time. We continued texting after that, but I noticed that things started to feel off.\n\nEventually, I found out that the girl's roommate had invited me to a Discord server where she had been sharing information about me in which they had been berating me and calling me names. When I asked the roommate if anyone had wronged my friend, she said that someone (me) had made her roommate feel uncomfortable so she claims by saying that I knew she was intimidated by me when we first met. I explained that I didn't mean it in a negative way and that I just wanted to clear up any misconceptions, but things continued to escalate and ‚Äúbullying‚Äù ensued. The girl eventually started calling me a \"weirdo\" and a \"creep\" and threatened to kick me out of the Discord server. Since this situation I have not spoken in the server \n\nThe problem is, the girl I'm speaking with doesn't have Discord or social media, so she's receiving all of this information from her roommate. When I saw the girl in person, she seemed distant and awkward, and I noticed that she was texting her roommate and laughing most likely at me. I'm not sure how to move forward or if I should just try to forget about the whole thing and move on.\n\nI'm not sure if I was in the wrong for what I said, but I'm willing to apologize if I did something to offend her or her roommate. The problem is, I'm not sure how to approach the situation or if it's even worth salvaging the friendship. I would ideally like to continue our friendship and studying but am not sure. \n\nThere is also the issue that whenever we hangout or eat it is always me inviting her never the other way around , is this something I should keep doing? I don‚Äôt want her to feel as though she‚Äôs obligated to say yes. \n\nAny advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

Super fun guy. Just kidding, it was a snail I met in the forest.\"\n\nI find these things funny, but the usual reaction I get is along the lines of:\n\n\"Dude wtf...\"\n\nAnd if they laugh, I feel like they're laughing at me, not with me. \n\nThe goal of my humor is to 1) demonstrate my value to people, and 2) to show them that I'm harmless\n\nDo you think my humor makes me look weird?  Noone seems to respect me and people often act superior towards me:/ maybe it has something to do with the humor?",

For example, if I were to say a really cringy thing, no one would laugh, but if the \"funny kid\" said it, people would laugh because it was so stupid. How do I become the \"funny kid\"? How can I make people really laugh, you know what I'm saying? \n\n(if the \"funny kid\" part is too confusing, my question in other words is how can I become funny without jokes?)",

Because of that, the administrative assistant to my professor has been chatting with me a lot lately. At first I thought it was just nice but now, she literally calls or texts me EVERY DAY. Idk if it‚Äôs that part that bothers me, or the fact that she thinks people with PhDs are ‚Äústupid‚Äù because they don‚Äôt have ‚Äúwork‚Äù experience. I‚Äôm in my 30s and worked in industry for years before coming back, but whatever. So, I have no genuine interest in being her friend. I just humor her, smile and nod, and try to give her hints that I‚Äôm busy, etc. \n\nHow do I tell her to stop bothering me? I have to talk to her when I need to schedule meetings with my PI or when I need reimbursement for conference travel so I don‚Äôt want to be a complete ass. I do feel insulted by her comment/general world view. She‚Äôs also extremely stubborn (we recently threw my PI a bday party - she claimed he was a leap year baby, but his birth year is 1966. I mentioned this and how leap years are divisible by 4‚Ä¶ and she CONTINUED to go on about how he‚Äôs still a leap year baby. I cannot stand her.) \n\nI don‚Äôt want a friendship with her and merely need her to give me insight into the PI‚Äôs schedule and conference travel. What do I do? I‚Äôm sorry if this post sounds mean, I just can‚Äôt deal with people who do and say this. I love my actual friends and love hearing from them; however, when I see a text from this person, I want to break my phone with a sledgehammer. \n\nTL;DR: admin person unrelated to my research is talking EXCESSIVELY to me on a daily basis via text and call. I want it to stop without being awkward or mean since I need her for scheduling/other admin stuff all the students need her for.",

They have a resume workshop tomorrow and even their flyers annoy me. \n\nWhy can't I be comfortable in a room I pay rent for? I feel like I'm being targeted. I do think somewhat my feelings of being overwhelmed have a bit to do with my mental health issues. \n\nI feel almost at the end of the rope I'm just not sure anymore what is the point?

        "text": "We've (me 30f, my husband 30m, our daughters 4 and 9 months) moved to a research campus in the States from the UK four months ago for husband's career. We made an effort to be friendly to everyone and of the friends I have made, they have all told me they are so glad to have met me, talk to me regularly, invite us to their place, and invite me and my girls out all the time, so I don't believe our behavior is terrible or offensive. However, everyone else we've had good conversations with now flat out pretend they don't see or hear us when we attend the children's movie nights on campus every Friday. One of them is our next door neighbor and is the father of two girls (8&amp;6) who love playing with my oldest and even come over to my house quite often, where I always give them food or cook for them if I don't already have anything prepared - but he will walk right past me when I say hello at Friday's event, unless his wife is with him. One lady invited me to her place only to do the same thing and she even called me when she was in my proximity to let me know my daughter was asking for me in the children's room, rather than approaching and be seen talking to me. Now my husband's coworkers have totally stopped talking to him and didn't even communicate that a high powered laser, which could have blinded him, was on when he was asked to work on it. He isn't even complaining about them not making small talk or anything (he is very adept at small talk and socializing in general), but he isn't getting vital information about the work communicated with him. So I have no idea what's going on or what to do since I've never experienced something like this before.",

And I end up leaving the place I went feeling way worse than when I started.\n\nIt's like one side of my brain wants to be social and is thinking 'yeah that would feel good to get to know people and have fun with them', and the other side doesn't see the point or thinks it'd be too much effort to maintain a conversation or whatever. I've always been like that and I can't snap out of it. And then I just regret it when I leave.\n\nEven when I see people I've already gotten acquainted with before. Some days I'll just not even bother saying hi or I try to avoid looking at them.

I hadnt been out for a few months but last weekend surprisingly an old friend asked if I wanted to join a group going out for some drinks. I normally would say no but Im trying to work on this kind of thing so I went along. I was my usual quiet nervous and anxious self for the fist hour or so but after a few beers it all melted away and I felt... like a normal person. I was talking and enjoying myself and really opening up. I even was talking to people I didnt know, and not even thinking about it. I approached a whole group of people and asked why they were all wearing Hawaiian shirts. (It was a birthday thing) But anyways one of the people I was out with was legit telling me \"wow Ive never seen this side of you before\" to which I think I said \"I forgot this side of me existed\"....\n\nSo my question is how can I be this person all the time? Because some if not most people seem to be this outgoing all the time without even trying or thinking about it.. Beyond becoming an alcoholic, how can I be more like this fun side of myself all the time? Because again, I had nearly forgotten that it even existed.¬†",
