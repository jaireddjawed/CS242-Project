I don't even know where I would need to start, what degrees I'd need to look at, or what job outcomes there are out there. I know this is incredibly vague, but I'd love for some advice from those that are in this field of expertise.\n\nThanks everyone :) ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/conservation/comments/4m54g6/how_to_get_into_conservation_with_an/",
        "text": "I recently graduated with a B.S. in environmental science. I've been looking at jobs in this field, and... well... they aren't exactly what you'd expect. It's more working for companies to clean up spills or helping them maximize profit by either telling them what the maximum amount is that they can pollute, or telling them that they can get away with polluting over limits and get slapped with a tiny fine.\n\nThis is depressing to me. I did this degree to help the environment, not harm it! I did take classes that are related to conservation. I took a stats class (it was for my minor, psychology, but at least it's something), a basic biology class, part 1 of gen chem, conservation biology, GIS, insect ecology (basically entomology), stream ecology, environmental education (I went out to local schools and taught 6th graders about aquaponics!) and part of a forest management class. \n\nI dropped the forest management class because it was too much for the semester, but I did have an internship at the Forest Service for a local National forest (Allegheny National Forest, if you were wondering). I learned quite a bit about forest management there, and also from my other classes- especially the GIS class. The GIS class worked with other classes to do maps for them a lot. \n\nI've always had a passion for conservation. Looking back, I feel like I should have gotten a biology degree, but... The college I went to focuses on pre-med, pre-dental, pre-nurse and pre-vet people. The non pre- people kinda got pushed off to the side. Since I went to a small liberal arts college, they didn't have stuff like Wildlife Biology, or Conservation Ecology. It was just biology, geology, and environmental science. It is the second best school for environmental science according to some website though, so... there's that. If you were wondering, it's called Allegheny College. There's a lot of Allegheny stuff in my life... \n\nA lot of my friends that share my passion have a double major in bio and enviro science, but I declared way too late. I was actually a geology major for the first two years, because my parents wanted me to continue the oil company that they started.... I know, this makes me look... weird. I get in arguments with my dad all the time over stuff. Thankfully, the geo classes transferred to the envi sci major, so I didn't need extra time for it.\n\nSo now I'm wondering what the best way to get into this field is. It wouldn't be too hard to go to grad school and pick it up for me, but I don't have the best grades... I ran into some major depression and hard times in college, and my grades suffered. I had a 3.0 GPA when I graduated, but all the enviro classes were A's and B's. Calculus was my lowest.... ugh math. I also transferred 40 credits in, so I had many of the \"easy GPA boosters\" already taken care of. \n\n I also have no idea what I want to specialize in. I love all of the environment, and I love learning about how it all interacts, and how people can be integrated into it without causing too much harm. I love learning about the details of the big issues. I've been reading about how poverty and terrorism is fuel for the poaching industry, and it's not just as simple as people wanting to get rich. I love plants, animals and fungi. I love the ocean, I love the temperate forests, the tropical forests, the deserts, the mountains... Everything. I'm afraid if I continue my education, I'll be stuck studying something so specialized that I will feel like I'm not making a big difference. \n\nI do want to go back and at least take some classes that I missed that a big for conservation. I would love to get to organic chemistry, and also take a better stats class. If possible, I'd love to take an ornithology class, because I missed out on birds. I've been trying to teach myself local bird calls with Cornell's Merlin Bird ID. If you guys have any other suggestions for classes that I should take, please let me know! I love learning!\n\nAlso volunteer for me is totally an option once my boyfriend and I figure out stuff. He has a degree in computer science, so he'll be making most of the money. I'm letting him pick where we go because he's got way more jobs to choose from than me. He can play the job field and get the best job for him. Then, once that gets settled, I'd be fine with traveling anywhere in the world and having homebase be where ever he is.\n\ntl;dr I feel like I got the wrong degree (environmental science, not biology) for this field. I feel like I didn't do well enough (3.0 overall for my college career) to continue my education, and I don't know what I would study in detail if I did. I do want to continue relevant classes though. ",

        "text": "Hi guys, first of all if there's another sub you believe this could be more suited to then please point me in the right direction!\n\nSo to get right to it, I'm looking to get some advice on possibly starting a career in conservation, I'm talking newbie advice. I'll give you guys an overview of my current situation:\n\n1. 22 years of age with no formal background in the field (I've always been a tech guy, currently working a 9-5 in IT Support *yawn*). Currently live in Manchester, UK.\n\n2. I'm currently renting a house with my girlfriend, looking to buy within a few years so unpaid full-time volunteering is out of the question unfortunately :(\n\n3. I like animals more than people. Without getting preachy, I'm absolutely fascinated by nature (especially the exotic variety), but my passion lies more within conserving the environment and wildlife more than, say, veterinary work.\n\n4. This could be a completely irrelevant point but why not bring it up? I'm not a vegan/vegetarian. I am a meat eater, I'd love to be able to cut meat out but I don't have the will power (I think). I'm only bringing this up because, and this is going to sound ignorant as hell, but I have absolutely no idea how it's viewed by other people with a passion for animal care and preservation. I don't personally know anybody who does it and I'm never surrounded by people on my wavelength when it comes to it.\n\nSo, staying with that point, this is my main reason for asking SHOULD I get into this line of work. I can imagine that at times you can come across some extremely infuriating things, for an obvious example, the Cecil the Lion story or the more recent Harambe the Gorilla incident. These types of things make my blood boil and I would presume you'd be exposed to a lot of that stuff. Obviously not first hand witnessing, but the facts and figures of poaching etc. Really infuriating stuff to me so would I be better off trying to stay in blissful ignorance, or take the dive and try to make a difference?\n\nI've been battling depression for the last couple of years, and I've hit a point where I've realised that any line of work I'm in that doesn't involve contributing in some way, whether creatively or otherwise, I'm going to remain unhappy. I'm still young so I want to remedy that as soon as I can. To put it lightly, whilst I enjoy the comfort of working from an office, the routine and the lack of enthusiasm for the job is beginning to take its toll on me.\n\nI've always been creative and tried my hand at numerous things (ex-drummer, currently a music producer, bits of graphic design and video editing, and photography most recently), but I've always been at my absolute happiest doing any activity involving animals or nature. Even small things like feeding the Hutias in the Cuban Mangroves, it was only a small part of the day but I'll always remember it.\n\nSo I'm done with my long-winded overview of myself, I just wanted to give a bit of detail on myself to see if anybody could get a picture of me and figure out if conservation is attainable for me and should I pursue it? I appreciate any responses and please ask questions, I want as much info as I can get. If there are any resources you could point me to then I would be extremely grateful.\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "I grew up going to Florida every year to visit my grandparents. My grandpa used to take us fishing, shrimping, and snorkeling. I fell in love with the ocean. I recently watched racing extinction again. I feel like I want to dedicate my life to helping the ocean. Since I'm not wealthy at all I would try a Go fund me. I would like to move to an island of the coast of Florida or build my own island. I would want it to be self sustaining. At this point I'm not sure what I could do. I was wondering if you can breed ocean animals that are endangered and release them into the wild. Or create a reef around the island and create breeding habitats for sharks or dolphins or other fish. Or if you could breed coral and place it back in the ocean. The fish I would breed would have to be fish that are local. Because you wouldn't want a non native species to get out. It could upset the food chain. Definitely open to other ideas.",
