        "text": "Back in Highschool around the time when teens my age would always post memes about there depression they don't have or their mental illness they prented they did. I say pretend because it will make sense in a moment. \n\nI don't need to mention I was not a well liked person everyone and their moms always had a random issue with me even my friends(I was the only autistic for some time in the school) but I noticed that those same people had a habit of learning about some mental disorder online and claiming they have it. At first I didn't care but over time it really pissed me off that people would claim they were mental/crazy/social outcasts but bully those who were mental/crazy/social outcasts. I didn't want to accuse people of lying but I had dumb idea that I was sure no one would fall for.\n\nI took an article page and edited it to talk about this made up disorder called \"Ketsun\" and various behaviors someone with ketsun would do like lack of empathy, always mad when they don't get their way, needs to be treated like royalty or else they would get sick and murderous behavior. The article did have grammar errors but those were intentional \n\nI ended up taking screenshots of the article about 5 or more and posted it to my FB account and waited for the comments of my schoolmates saying they are like this and omg so me. I laughed to myself and thought the joke was finished. \n\nNext day however people won't shut up about the ketsun how they may have it one of them even admitted to getting diagnosed with it by a professional(lies obviously). \n\nI regretted my prank when the person who claimed to be professionally diagnosed started to be abusive around the school hitting people or hurting them with her pen for no reason then blaming a fake mental disorder teachers and her parents had to step in and told her the disorder is fake but she didn't want to admit it and got expelled.\n\nI owned up to it and explained my reason behind the mess only for everyone to call me a liar because \"someone like you could never do something so clever and calculated\". (It was just a dumb prank I didn't expect to go this far)",

        "text": "It’s currently February 28, and I’ve had two mental hospital visits this year. The first time was for five days, the second time was for three days. This was all because I had two overdoses in an attempt to end my life. The first mental hospital was really great, genuinely one of the nicest facilities. Colors everywhere, multiple group sessions a day, unlimited access to streaming services, and pretty great food for a hospital, if you’re telling me. I had gained weight while in there. The second facility was quite different, not awful but when my parents came to visit they compared it to prison. They said it was probably the worst looking hospital I had stayed at. The food was okay, but most meals I didn’t eat more than half. I lost weight when I left. The first place I had so many people to talk to in their, I never wanted to spend a second in my room. The second place, people talked to me but sometimes I just wanted to be left alone. Very different experiences at both. \n\nI miss it. Maybe it’s the daily structure, maybe it’s the not having to deal with the real world, maybe it’s the atmosphere or the people. Something about it, I just miss. Sometimes I wish I was back in their just for another day or two. Maybe even a whole week. Yeah, it fucking sucks, but there was some real comfort in there. I feel kind of crazy to have enjoyed it so much. And not even necessarily enjoy, but man it was such a nice break from the real world. I couldn’t do whatever I want, but I also basically could. The staff is what really makes it for me. I just had such a great staff team at both facilities. I wish I knew why I would want to go back. I don’t plan on going back, it would crush my family. But sometimes, I just miss it",

Someone stole my $2,000 laptop and scholarship card that I earned. It may have been my roommate. I may have been in the wrong room. I think a girl raped me in college too. It may have been her.

My glasses went missing (were stolen) often and I can't think without them.\n\nMother wouldn't let me eat at home and chased me on the way to the bathroom. I tried hiding in the closet. I had one pair of clothes. She stole what little my aunt and uncle gave me whe. She may have raped me or tried to. She took me out of class to go to a behavioral health thing. I threw my glasses on the ground in anger and she took them. I can't think when I can't see and there were confusing activities that nobody explained. All the while, I would get blamed. She would also kiss me all the time while I was distracted. I remember at least one time, she tried to rape me. I tried escaping but I didn't know where to go. My brother and sister left me there alone with her. Nobody asked me what was wrong. My mother is fortunately dead now.\n\nI think I met Keegan Peel in the unit but I couldn't see and he didn't say much.

I’d managed to slip away with £500 in cash, at 14 years old this was crazy money, the next day I rang my friend and got on the bus to the city centre and went nuts, we bought CD’s, posters, guitar tablature books, new band merch, skateboard decks, all the fast food we wanted, we were kings for a day!",

However, because of my group's status they all relied on me.\n\n Most of the time, i slacked. i should have dont something about it at home, not rely on the one hour we had every day at school. When the time came, we didnt memorize any dance steps, which cost my group 150 points, which is an automatic fail.\n\nSo there goes my hope at a sport (chess) scholarship for highschool. I feel like a damn fool, i should have done more. \n\nI dont even know how to tell my parents. I know my dad would be soft, yet disappointed. My mum, however, would not be happy. I know it would be best to let her know earlier, not spring it on her last second.\n\nMy grades are fine, But one fail would ruin my chances for highschool. In my country, the passing grade is 75. I know i'll be getting something in the 60's. \n\nI dont know what to do. I might study better, at least make up that class for another one. But i just had to get this out somewhere.",

I started playing games with them more and more, and we would argue once in a while but that was all fine, most friends did. Anyways, a few months later we got into a bad argument and I was scared they would stop wanting to be friends with me, however I started to gain feelings for her, she told me that she liked me after a few weeks, I was so happy as this was the first girl I had genuinely liked and we had decided right then to start dating. But after a few months we fought more and more and I was blinded by liking her, thinking things would get better after every fight. Oh how wrong I was. For her birthday I had been saving up some money and decided to get her something that would last a while, I got her a new computer and balloons, flowers, the whole thing. But a few weeks later we had a bad fight. It was to the point she told me to off myself. So I tried. I tried so hard to suffocate myself but came to no avail. I then gave up on trying anymore and ignored it, a few days later we went back to playing again. And again, she told me off myself, I decided to ignore it this time. But when she told me a few weeks later that she had bad news, it scared me, she told me she had been cheating on me and that she hated how I acted all the time. I had already lost all my friends at this point due to trying to spend time with her, I got upset, dumped her and moved on, so I thought. But I soon got addicted to p**n and started struggling more, I struggled in school as well. Eventually I got tired of it and when I went hiking with some of my family, that I hadn't said anything too because I'm a dumbass, I tried to jump off a cliff. They thought I just fell and called for an ambulance. Eventually I started getting better, went back to working, and gained so many friends there. I still haven't even told my closest friends this. So if you read the whole thing, that's my confession.",

        "text": "Just what the title suggests. I was trying to pull into a super tight spot and ended up having to back up before I hit this person’a car. There’s another car coming where I’m leaving out after I reversed out the spot (we’re in two different lanes, side by side, if that makes sense. I’m sorry for the horrible description of that) and because we’re so close and I’m horrified to side swipe this person, I ended up side swiping ANOTHER person’s car! No damage to their car at all, besides a small scratch of my cars white paint on the back of their bumper, it’s a bigger bumper since it was a truck(I thoroughly checked just to make sure I didn’t harm their property), but the side of my car is scratched and dented for sure near my headlight. So, because I didn’t think there was any real peppery damage, I just left since the only damage is on MY end. The bad thing is, this was not my car, I’m not on the car owner’s insurance, and I’m living in fear the person’s who car I hit HAS sustained damage to the truck and will request video footage of the parking lot since we were in Walmart parking lot and will run the tags and it will connect back to the owner of the car and I. THE OWNER OF THE CAR DOESNT KNOW THIS HAPPENED AND I CANT TELL THEM!!!! I just can’t!! I’ve offered to pay for all repairs upfront to the car owner since I fucked up SO BADLY and feel HORRIBLE about this situation. My guilty conscience is killing me and I feel so bad! I know I should’ve done a lot different today, but I panicked and was scared. As I type this, it is 10:52Pm on EST and this accident happened around 1 Pm this afternoon. It’s all I can think about. I feel so bad and have seriously cried and asked for forgiveness from my own personal God about this. I know the answer is so obvious, but it doesn’t feel like it’s the most obvious one to take in this situation. What do I do? Thank you all for reading this and hopefully not judging me too badly",

A homeless girl. \n\nI threw a line out and asked if she needed a place to stay. I didn't really get a straight answer, so I kind of tricked her. \n\nI figured I had the capacity to give her the kind of care she needed to get back on her feet.

She has 2 beautiful daughters who have become a big part of my life. \n\n\nShe doesn't know the whole story, and frankly I think it's better that way. She's pretty happy right now.

        "text": "I have step brothers, they are all super close with me and my other full siblings because we have been a family for so long. I am the oldest and was more of a caregiver to them when they were very young. I also had other crazy life stuff happen that made me mature fast and have to play an adult role in my own and many others lives as well.\n\nThat said my parents have inappropriate boundaries, with me included. Telling me things they shouldn’t tell a child, treating me like a peer and expecting me to fend for myself since a very young age. You know, being treated like its a privilege they gave me life and I owe it to them to sustain myself, more an inconvenience and struggle to support then a child to care for.\n\nThis brought me close to my younger siblings and makes me very protective of them always trying to show them what real love and real relationships are like. To be cared for and have respect and kindness from family members.\n\nMy step mom and my biological parent told me several times that they think one of my step moms kids does not share the same father as her other two sons. She never told the potential father and never told the father of her other two sons as she was cheating (he is her middle son). He also looks nothing like his brothers or “dad” and looks far more like the other man’s daughter. They justified not telling my brother as he was young, now he is in highschool. They justify not telling him now by saying he behaves like his “dad” so he must be his. (Total bullshit). \n\nNow they should have NEVER told me, especially when I was very young. And yes as a small child he wouldn’t understand but I think he deserves to know. I cant just flat out say it as then my parents would be very upset with me obviously, but I feel like I am betraying my brother. He is not necessarily in the most mature mindset or healthy home situation to get this news. I never want to risk causing him anymore pain, but he doesn’t know this may be a possibility! \n\nI have thought about buying him a 23 &amp; me test or tell him to do so. Or anonymously messaging him somehow but I think it would come back to me, or don’t want him to think I was a part of hiding this from him if it comes in anonymously. Confused and guilty",

        "text": "Началось всё с того что я начала замечать за ней странное поведение, она стала меньше писать, редко отвечать и проявлять холод. Мы знакомы 4 года, но всё время общались только через интернет так как живём в разных странах. Она на год младше меня, но за такое время даже по интернету стала самым близким человеком. После того как она начала всё больше и больше отдаляться я уже прямо спросила «что случилось»  и она сорвалась. Рассказала о том что ей действительно плохо, хотя всё вроде как налаживается(раньше у неё были огромные моральные травмы из-за родителей, общества, постоянных унижений со стороны многих людей). Она не ходила к психологу, её родители не позволили так как считают всё чушью, а сама она несовершенолетняя. Она рассказала о том что у неё наконец то появились друзья, более менее начали выстраиваться отношения с родителями и обществом, появилась девушка, но плохое моральное состояние так и не прошло и просто тянуло вниз, а она даже не пыталась бороться, и сколько бы я не предлагала ей переложить все проблемы на меня, рассказать, просто скинуть груз, она отказывалась, так как я сама в не очень хорошем состоянии и она волновалась за меня. В итоге в мою голову взбрёл безумный план на который она всё же согласилась при условии что лечение буду проходить и я. План состоял в том что я стану её психологом, тайно. Я купила новую симку, вставила в другой телефон, создала новый аккаунт, около двух недель изучала углублённо психологию, читала огромные книги и статьи, было проще тем что я и так это делала до этого, но не так углублённо, потратила собранные деньги на неделю курсов и уже через почти три недели без сна, нормального питания и отдыха я сообщила ей что я нашла психолога. Ей было страшно, но когда я сказала что уже типо написала, она решилась. Нигде не было подвоха, абсолютно ни в чём, фото которое я взяла в интернете не было, никаких совпадений с чем-то или ещё что тоже не могло случиться. И уже спустя месяц разговоров с ней, подделывания переписок, делать вид что я тоже решаю свои проблемы и решения её проблемы, она справилась. Всё прежнее отпустила, начала ещё более активно налаживать со всеми отношения и смогла наконец то вдохнуть. Пока я медленно выгорала, так как свои проблемы я не решала. Они  усугублялись ещё больше и давление от всей этой ситуации в итоге вылилось в то что я сама ей рассказала правду. Через время, наверное недели две, она мне позвонила, я тогда жутко поссорилась с отцом и когда она начала расспрашивать не выдержала  и рассказала всё. Как говорится сделала не подумав, о чём сильно пожалела. Она обвинила меня в обмане и разорвала все связи. Я жутко жалею об этом, о том что не рассказала, скрыла и даже не думала бы рассказывать если бы не тот случай. Я не виню её, я виню себя, за то что обманула. Я буду жалеть об этом всю жизнь и каждый день напоминать сама себе об этом, но единственное от чего мне легче что у меня всё таки получилось помочь ей и теперь я хотя бы уверена что она с собой ничего не сделает. Но я всё так же люблю её и надеюсь что когда нибудь она меня простит.",
