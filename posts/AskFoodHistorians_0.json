        "text": "In Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" (1599) the fool Touchstone delivers a monologue where he mentions eating pancakes with mustard. I've done a little reading on this out of curiosity, and some scholars believe the play was first performed for the Queen on a Shrove Tuesday. Touchstone is possibly referencing having just come from a Pancake Day feast. Apparently they are talking about a kind of savory pancake that was intended to use up rich ingredients lying around before Lent. This is so interesting to me. I'm not sure if we have quite the same thing today anywhere... the closest examples I can think of are crepes obviously (the play is set in France), and okonomiyaki (which coincidentally translates roughly to \"as you like it\" based on the choice of toppings). I would love to try making something like what he's talking about. Does anyone have places I could do some further reading on Shrove Tuesday meal preparations of that era? I'd love it if I could find a recipe I might be able to even remotely duplicate that's not just me pouring bisquick on stuff.",

What would those Chinese sailors eat every day and special meals such as the peas pudding and lobscow Townsend made in his recent video.  Did they have hard tack?

It tastes like sweet vanilla yogurt and kefir with a very delicate and thick texture, on the verge of being drinkable.\n\nFor its production, two types of lactic bacteria are used at once - \"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus\" and \"Streptococcus thermophilus\"\n\nTechnically, this is something in common between fermented baked milk (but not baked) and yogurt, but with the addition of sugar and vanilla\n\n2. Raf-coffe - appeared as a result of experiments in the Moscow coffee house \"Coffee Bean\" in 1996-1997.  A regular visitor to the cafe, director Rafael Timarbaev, refused the usual coffee drinks, and asked the barista to come up with something new for him.  As a result of the experiment of three baristas - Gleb Neveykin, Artyom Berestov and Galina Samokhina - a coffee drink \"for Raf\" appeared.  It was softer and sweeter than regular coffee drinks with milk.  Later, visitors who liked the novelty began to ask for “coffee like for Raf”, and gradually the name was reduced to “Raf-coffee” or simply “Raf”.\n\nThis is a coffee with cream instead of milk, where vanilla sugar is added instead of regular sugar, and then it is all whipped until it turns into a thick, fluffy drink.\n\nAlways served in a faceted glass",

Specifically, they stated that \n\n&gt;  The world went crazy in the ‘60s, and that included cuisine.\n\nThey attribute that to\n\n&gt; [b]etter availability of ingredients, more willingness to experiment and less pressure to make it “exactly as written”.\n\nAnd they cite their extensive cookbook collection and their life experience of having lived through it as evidence.\n\nHow much truth is there to this?  While I can see that, over time, more variations on recipes become known, I hesitate to attribute this to some larger cultural willingness to experiment and change recipes.  It seems that the simpler explanation would be globalization and the ability to share variations on \"traditional/standard\" recipes, rather than the variations arising in that time and in that place due to the \"culture\" of the '60s.  Does anyone here have any insight to help me learn more about this?  Thanks!",

This might be something as simple as stir-fried long beans or hot-sour soup with wood-ear mushrooms and tofu sheets. \n\nHowever, I noticed that chow-mien, fried rice, or potstickers are among the most \"hyped\" Chinese dishes and coincidentally all carb-based. I see this pattern (although with much limited understanding) in other Americanized dishes, such as pizza and pasta in Italian, biryani and dosa in Indian, jollof rice in West African, bibimbap in Korean, etc etc. \n\nI am aware that many other non-carb dishes ascend to popularity as well (Chinese beef and broccoli or Indian tikka masala), but I rarely encounter an Italian poached fish or an African okro stew.\n\nIs there a correlation between carb and western adaptation in ethnic dishes? If so what might of led to that? Thank you!!",

        "text": "I've had this discussion with my parents a few days ago and we were thinking about the fact that this modern consumption of beef and breeding of cattle in a high scale just for obtaining its meat is quite recent in mankind's history.\nWhen you think about the past, keeping cattle in a large number was a difficult thing considering how much land it demands for the animal to graze. Not to forget that, unlike pigs and sheep, it would be difficult to confine cattle herd in a barn during the winter time.\nSure, people had cows. However, it was bred for its milk, not necessarily to slaughter in order to obtain its meat. Perhaps that's the reason ( or one of the reasons) why there are few beef dishes in many European and Asian cuisines compared to pork, lamb, poultry and seafood.\nI guess another aspect of why the high consumption of meat is so recent is that only a few countries have the \"geographical\" luck of having enough plain land that is appropriate for breeding cattle in a large scale, in which can include countries like the US, Brazil, Australia, Argentina, etc. One curious fact is that these countries are former colonies, in which had other functions and activities during its colonial time and would start a beef production long after their respective independences. Perhaps that's another factor to it.\n\nWell, this is just my thoughts. I'm don't have a major in history, nor do I know if these points are historically valid. So please, let me know if there is some truth to it or if there are other factors missing out.",

        "text": "Shredded Crispy Beef, or simply Crispy Beef, also known as [Crispy](https://uk.lkk.com/recipes/crispy-chilli-beef) [Chilli Beef](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/crispy-chilli-beef) (UK), Ginger Beef (Calgary, Canada), [Rainbow Beef](https://www.wokandkin.com/crispy-rainbow-beef/) (Australia), and [Rusty Nails](https://www.facebook.com/tangsfamilychineserestaurant/photos/crispy-peking-beef-rusty-nail/269321800396251/?paipv=0&amp;eav=AfZynhHf3dnntoySpI4HdZPDrgwQgtHYJKFbiHJtIYnKo_aUYJdewiS3nIQmB-v-LrU&amp;_rdr) (Australia/Singapore) has become a staple of British- and Canadian-Chinese cuisine and was once a staple of New York American-Chinese that is now rapidly disappearing. Even American-Chinese chain Panda Express serves this dish as part of its main menu under the name [Beijing Beef](https://www.pandaexpress.ca/en/menu/entrees/beijing-beef). Despite widespread adoption and love for this dish, its history in the west remains rather opaque.\n\nDespite many English-language attributions to this dish’s Hunan heritage, I have never encountered a similar or even reminiscent dish while in Changsha. Rather, I believe that this dish originated or was inspired by a Sichuan dish known as [Dry-Fried Shredded Beef 干煸牛肉丝](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%B9%B2%E7%85%B8%E7%89%9B%E8%82%89%E4%B8%9D/954218) (gan bian niu rou si)—which itself originates from a fried rice-paddy eel dish.\n\nDry-frying involves neither marinade nor sauce, and traditionally relies on the gradual drying out of the main ingredient over moderate heat, with the subsequent addition of spices and flavorings. The beef, which is cut into strips, ends up slightly crisp and chewy, with a delicious toasty fragrance and a dry, spicy taste (Dunlop, The Food of Sichuan).\n\nThere is a distinct homogeneity between the sweet deep-fried western versions—in stark contrast to the spicy dry-fried Chinese [original](https://k.sina.cn/article_6677863968_18e081e2000100dwqi.html)—which begs the question of where the sweet western version of this dish originated and who created it?\n\nThe rise of crispy beef in the West appears to have coincided with the haute British- and American-Chinese (“chinois”) restaurant [movement](https://www.seriouseats.com/ed-schoenfeld-chinese-food-personal-history) of the 1970’s and 1980’s in London and New York, respectively; including [Mr Chow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Chow), Shun Lee Palace, the original Hwa Yuan, and the late [Chin Chin](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?searchResultPosition=7#:~:text=shredded%20beef%20with%20chilies) and Tse Yang. To the best I can tell, crispy beef was, and is still, [available at all of the above restaurants](https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/24/arts/dining-out-guide-chinese-in-midtown.html). [Distinct](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/07/arts/restaurants-eastern-cuisine-worth-a-trip-west.html#:~:text=Crispy%20orange%20beef%2C%20tried%20at%20lunch%2C%20was%20leathery%20and%20afloat%20in%20orange%20grease.%20It%20didn%27t%20come%20close%20to%20the%20excellence%20of%20the%20crunches%20of%20glazed%2C%20shredded%20dry%20sauteed%20beef%20tossed%20with%20slivers%20of%20incendiary%20green%20chilies) from orange beef, which was [created in its American form in 1971](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/17/dining/critic-s-notebook-the-vanishing-haute-cuisine.html) by [T.T. Wang](https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/19/obituaries/tt-wang-influential-master-of-chinese-kitchen-dies-at-55.html) of Hunam and [Shun Lee Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shun_Lee_Palace) restaurants in New York, shredded crispy beef began to [appear](https://archive.vn/91ugS) on American-Chinese restaurant menus by the late 1970’s. It is mentioned, and described in contrast to orange beef, in a [1981 New York Times review](https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/07/arts/restaurants-eastern-cuisine-worth-a-trip-west.html#:~:text=Crispy%20orange%20beef%2C%20tried%20at%20lunch%2C%20was%20leathery%20and%20afloat%20in%20orange%20grease.%20It%20didn%27t%20come%20close%20to%20the%20excellence%20of%20the%20crunches%20of%20glazed%2C%20shredded%20dry%20sauteed%20beef%20tossed%20with%20slivers%20of%20incendiary%20green%20chilies) of Shun Lee Palace. Short of combing through the [Spiller Collection](https://archive.org/details/spiller), that is pretty much where the trail goes cold for me. I am unable to find any readily available documentation on the origins of this dish in the west.\n\nSo, who created American-/British-Chinese shredded crispy beef?\n\nEdit: I am sure the venerable u/papayabear may know the answer, but I am not sure if she is still around these parts.\n\n—\nNote on Shredded Ginger Beef: George Wong of the now defunct Silver Inn restaurant in Calgary [claims](https://www.foodnetwork.ca/article/the-delicious-history-of-ginger-beef/) to have invited “Deep-Fried Shredded Ginger Beef” in the 1970’s by “playing with a recipe from Northern China and [being] inspired by British pub grub, George deep-fried shredded beef and then simmered the crispy strips in a spicy chili sauce.” Thus it is possible that the Canadian version arose independently, especially as it contains very large strips of beef compared to its American and British counterparts.",
