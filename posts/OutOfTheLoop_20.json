        "text": "I'm in the age group that grew up with Harry Potter, awaiting the next book release, trying to get a copy of it before other people and reading it as fast as you could so that you wouldn't get caught by spoilers. I probably read the first four books several times, and the rest once. I think I still have the first book around somewhere buried in a box, convinced I should keep it because it wasn't the Americanized version/language. Saw the movies. I remember playing a game in PS2 a long time ago that I always had fun with because you could fly a broom around and stuff.\n\nBut it's all so far behind me now that I just remember it fondly as a \"those were fun books and ok movies and a cool game I played as a kid\".\n\nI recall something about the author, JK Rowling making some remarks publicly about trans people long after she had made her billions that didn't favour her well, but it was one of those things that I just go huh and move on. Like I say - part of my childhood but it's not something I'm super involved in.\n\nI see that there is a new video game out now - and honestly the bits I've seen invoke those childhood memories - open world, get to fly a broom around, looks kind of cool - I stop and look at those things for the same reason I find it neat to see what the next star wars game looks like, or lord of the rings - it's just neat looking stuff that brings back some childhood memories for a minute or two, and I move on.\n\nBut this game - every post in r/all about this game just seems to have fights happening over it - people saying don't buy it because of JK Rowling's stance on trans people, that it has holocaust vibes in it, that any funds from it are being used to fight civil rights movements - for someone out of the loop it's simply outlandish. [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/111fmo0/bad_decisions_at_hogwarts/) is an example of one such post, I can't seem to find the one that originally led me to really start questioning this which was some hyperbole about comparing the game to an ice cream shop where buying an ice cream was equivalent to harming someone. \n\nI have no stake in this other than some childhood nostalgia. I'm not buying the game because I just straight up don't have time to play games anymore. I don't have an opinion on Rowling. I support anyone's right to do what they want with their own body. I just feel like there is some rollercoaster going on with this game that I just don't understand and am out of the loop on.\n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/clevercomebacks/comments/111fmo0/bad_decisions_at_hogwarts/",
