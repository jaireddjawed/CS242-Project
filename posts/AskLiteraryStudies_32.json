        "text": "In your colleges and universities, do you study and analyze literature the same way it is taught in America? Most importantly, how do you classify and categorize literature? By race? Style? Language? Geography? Etc.?\n\nFurther, how does a literature class look like and run in college, both Graduate and Undergraduate? \n\nEdit: I apologize for the vague post, and unspecified information. It was in class that I got to the idea, and I just went to sleep as soon as I got off from class. Here are the questions that I am pondering:\n\nAre literature classes typically heavy in theory? Are theories taught standalone in separate classes? Are classes run more on a seminar base, or are they mainly lectures? When dealing with \"minority\" literature, how is that grouped? Commonwealth literature? Third World Literature? (These previous three questions may lean more towards full Anglophone countries. What is the format of \"survey\" classes? For example, English literature, American literature, World literature (etc.). How do colleges group the classes they teach? Is it on the form (like poetry, the novel)? Diversity as in minority or marginalized groups' literature? Time period? \n\nFurther, if you could provide a little snippet on how the average literature class runs in your respective country, that would be amazing.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

        "text": "So I've been writing fiction for two or three decades now. I skipped college, at first, because I didn't want to be taught how to write creatively, or I didn't want to pay for that privilege. I simply wrote. A couple years ago I got this hankering to go to college, and I'm attending an alternatively-styled state school out in Washington State, where I have more of a say in the direction of my learning.\n\nI have intermittently picked up critical works before going to school. Really good ones have seemed like *concentrated* forms of literature, while others feel like a dreamy sort of cogitation. I largely have been turned off by post-modern thinkers in the Marxist-Freudean vein, and currently I'm in the middle of a love affair with Paul Ricoeur. \n\nNow the question: I'm doing an independent paper this quarter, and while setting it up, my sponsor (a professor) spoke about my \"argument\". Which got me thinking: I'm not interested in interpreting literature, or adding to the bulk of critical work that is aimed at the readership. I want to formulate a *working understanding* of literature as an act of \"the productive imagination\" (following Ricoeur, following Kant).\n\nWhen did criticism become the domain of professional readers (either critics or academics)? How do you think this orientation influences their arguments? And would theory that is produced by a practicing fictionists be inherently different than the arguments and schematisms of the likes of Bloom, Derrida, and Foucault? \n\nWhat comes to mind is the \"writer's advice\" articles and books that are aimed at fledgling writers (writ by Steven King and Kurt Vonnegut, or \"Pixar's 20 rules of story\", which hit /r/all by way of /r/books)—these types of articles aren't really theory in the sense that they aren't concerned with understanding the inner mechanics of how fiction is assembled, but are oriented to tell people how to best go about producing what is already consumed. I want something more rigorous than that...\n\nI suppose my inquiry has two parts: is academic criticism aware of and content with its \"Secondary\" role? And what sorts or theory is out there that is meant for those who produce \"Primary\" texts?\n\n**EDIT** I'm on mobile so I wanted to batch reply and qualify this question a bit. \n\nFirst, I adore critical theory, and did not intend to make a quality judgement on this important work. I meant \"primary\" and \"secondary\" texts as a jab at the terminology, not to put creative work over critical endeavors. \n\nI have a vague feeling that the way we are taught to structure arguments in academia is predisposed toward a certain type of activity with texts that is distinct from how one goes about constructing a work of fiction. *The very mode of analysis presupposes a readerly viewpoint and value system.* I'm looking for critiques of criticism that might shed light on this difference. I'm also looking for works which seek to describe how one might go about building a working knowledge of fiction. A rigorous architectural manual of narrative, so to speak. \n\n",

Personally, my family's experience is one of leaving behind a comfortable agrarian existence to eke out a harder but more fulfilling life elsewhere. For the generations following the one that made the move, memories of the original land or place transcend into legend and create a yearning for a geographical \"rooting\" even though such a place no longer exists. I've read the more popular works that cover these themes, like those from Jhumpa Lahiri and Junot Diaz.\n\nI hope this concept makes sense, and any suggestions that can be given will be immensely appreciated!

        "text": "So I consider myself quite well read literarily speaking but ignorant about theory (I'm a poet, so I've read tons of historical poetry, but I tend to approach it more as a reader and studier of craft than as a scholar, and I've never even set foot in a university English classroom) but recently I've been listening to [lectures by William Flesch](http://www.openculture.com/restoration_and_18th_century_poetry_from_dryden_to_wordsworth_free_course) about 18th century poetry. \n\nOne point Flesch makes repeatedly is that in the 18th century poetry was thought of as necessarily engaged with the culture and the larger goings on of the world, whereas this approach was largely abandoned by the Romantics. In my own reading of Romantic poetry, though, I've found that a lot of poets do engage in social criticism (Blake's Chimney Sweep poems for example), even if it is not to the extent of for example Pope. My own experience is that social criticism was neither a constant in the 18th century (Pope wrote Eloisa to Abelard, Gray's elegies can't be in any way seen as political) nor absent in the early 19th.\n\nIt is obvious to me that there *was* a sharp divide between poets like Thomas Gray and almost all English poets post-Lyrical Ballads until around 1840, but Flesch claims that modern and contemporary poetry is entirely based on the Romantic view of poetry rather than the preexisting 18th century view. I'm assuming he does not include in this 20th century modernism (TS Elliot vigorously rejected Romanticism, and I can't imagine that Pope would quite like Ezra Pound if they could ever know each other) or the movements that arose from it, but I still think that even in the 19th century the tradition of for example Gray's Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College is very much alive in Arnold's Dover Beach. Am I misunderstanding Flesch, is Flesch simply wrong, or am *I* simply wrong?",

        "text": "I normally begin my semester trying to explain the evolution of the novel from Homer and the way \"he\" portrayed his characters, to Cervantes, to Fielding, to Flaubert to Joyce and to C McCarthy and DeLillo. I would like if they would have very clear in mind that what they're reading or watching (tv-series, like, for example, The Wire, The Knick, True Detective) today is part of a wider and interesting history. I find that is important (beside the gratuitous beauty of seeing the evolution of how inner and outer reality has been represented) for them to understand because: 1. Behind every genius and masterpiece there is always a cultural process and a story: the rising of the middle class produces Jane Austen and for the first time the adventurous goes on the background and promenade, tea and chatting come on the foreground. Reading a scene of people just eating and chatting, what we give today for understood and normal, wasn't normal at all up to a certain point. The alienation of middle class produces Flaubert. Basically what Auerbach and Franco Moretti (especially in his long and remarkable essay, The Serious Century) have written. 2. that the novel is busy trying to decipher, specially from Cervantes on, the lebenswelt, the world of life. This, trying to convey this concept to my students is a fricking painful effort. 3. That the western novel is the product of a tribe, like characters of a meganovel: that comprehend greek, russians, french, japanese, american, british, spanish characters. 4. Thinking that reading novel is intellectual stuff is a quite recent (and to me wrong) idea. Cervantes was considered a loser, not a genius, and novels were considered to be rubbish and novelists were guilty to corrupt imagination. The idea of the novelist superstar like Hemingway or even DeLillo or Franzen is very recent.\n\nHas anyone out there a suggestion, a book, an article, a clever infographic or timeline that could explain in a easy but not banal way what succinctly here I've tried to say?",

It is one of the 4 core subjects studied in school so it has to fit in somewhere. It has always seemed to me that while Literature can be interpreted as a window to human emotion, but, unlike Psychology, it isn't tested and therefore cannot be accepted as fact. While literature can be used as a means to share feelings with other humans, I don't believe that any author (or publisher for that matter) would want to limit these emotions to scholars of society.\n\nTL;DR I am having trouble seeing literature as more than a form of entertainment, so why go to the lengths that you guys go to to understand it?",

The idea of the author as the ultimate authority, the \"author-god\" of their work is essentially, dead.\n\nI first heard about this in an undergraduate seminar, which was very unfulfilling. One person said, as a budding author themselves, they found it offensive, wrongly assuming Barthes was suggesting they wouldn't be entitled to take credit for their own work. My favourite (read:the stupidest) comment was \"but what if you gave the author truth serum, so they had to tell you the real meaning?\" again, wrongly assuming that the problem was that Barthes was suggesting the author *wouldn't* reveal the ultimate message of their work, rather than *couldn't* do so. To be clear: I don't dislike these arguments because they don't agree with Barthes, but because they show a lack of understanding of Barthes' argument.\n\nI personally find the argument presented in this essay very compelling and one of the most useful I have ever read, but I'd really love to hear what everyone here thinks. Are there any sound arguments against this essay, or do people generally accept this idea? My university was very big on close-reading, and as they say you tend to agree with the opinions of your teacher. So I'd love to hear other viewpoints to expand my thinking.",

I’m not entirely sure if the information I'm going to provide will be enough to go on, but I thought I'd try anyway.\n\nI’m interested in studying the role of time within narrative—not just narrative chronology necessarily (like how time passes in *To the Lighthouse*, for example), but how time affects people. For instance, when in *The Sound and the Fury* Quentin is driven to breaking his father’s watch because of his relationship to time or, somewhat adversely, how Dean Moriarty in *On the Road* continuously claims that he “knows time” and therefore everything will be just fine. More specifically: how people interact with time as a human construct/conception but also how they deal with time in being able to interpret the past and hope for the future.\n\nI’m a bit all over the place here and I’m not even sure whether this sort of thing is commonly studied or if it’s even focused on at all. Would anyone be able to help me out with sort of narrowing my search to a specific “school” of literary criticism or theory that deals with this sort of theme?  I’m just starting Culler’s *Literary Theory: A Short Introduction* and it’s sparked an interest in beginning some early further reading. I haven’t taken any university classes in literary criticism or theory yet—I’m an English major but so far my classes have focused more on themes like American Literature broadly—but I’d ideally like to further my education in literary studies after my undergrad and thought I’d start here.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nThanks.",

Here I can search for any word, and it will show the results, but in random order.

Without the ability to sort by date, the wealth of data in EEBO Phase I is useless to me. I don't see any option on the version hosted by the University of Michigan to circumvent this limitation by, say, searching for all instances of a word in a smaller date range. The only ways to limit the search are by author, subject, citation, or style.\n\nMy understanding is that the *data* of EEBO Phase I is now open to the public, so that anyone can host it in any way they see fit (I'm sure there are limitations, but my understanding is that ProQuest and the University of Michigan are not the only ones who can host searchable databases of EEBO).\n\nDoes anyone know of a way to sort large sets of EEBO data by date on another free version?

        "text": "So I have odd request: I'm looking for essays or criticism that examine *Paradise Lost* though the lens of Cold War history/politics. \n\nSome background, I'm a playwright who wrote a stage adaptation of the poem. It's been a few years since the production went up, but I still think about the poem a lot. \n\nA influential book for me concerning my read of the poem, is none other than Alan Moore's *Watchmen.* They're both about simple worlds which move towards complexity, where Good and Evil become tangled and frustrated and can no longer be resolved through mere force - about the way that force twists against itself and corrupts its own aims. But this isn't just a theme of Watchmen, it's a theme of the Cold War in general - a series of morally ambiguous calculations that commonly backfired. Additionally, we often talk about how the Cold War era represents a loss of innocence: the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam.  \n\nAlso, concerning the political situation in the poem - it begins with a war of direct conflict, of open arms, resolved in a cataclysmic fashion that then transitions into a war of ideas, conducted with \"covert guile\", fought through proxies, behind which looms the threat of ultimate annihilation \"with repenting hand abolish His own works\". A sort of spiritual \"twilight struggle\".    \n\nI feel like I might be reaching (I'm probably reaching), but it's been my experience that just *so* much has been written about the poem that you can pretty much pull any random idea out of a hat and find a scholar connecting it to *Paradise Lost* if you just search hard enough. \n\nThe closest thing I could find was an essay on how Milton's prose works like *Areopagitica* became a flashpoint in literary studies amidst McCarthyist crackdowns at universities in the 1950s.

These key writers had sections of the Anthology dedicated to essays and studies of their work. \n\nI haven't read much Munro myself, and of course she is a Nobel Laureate, but is she really held in that much esteem to be compared with writers like Chekhov and Faulkner? \n\nI hope this doesn't sound negative, because I don't think I have read enough of her to hold an opinion, I was just unaware how much esteem she holds.",

Or is it not really done ever since the whole 'Author is Dead' thing to talk about the author's state of mind/opinions?\n\nI was thinking about making my essay title/statement: 'Shakespeare the first Existential philosopher'\nAnd talking about how his characters contemplate the meaning of life (finding there is none) and how this justifies suicide in some of their eyes (e.g. Glouster, Hamlet, Ophelia...)\nAnd how this almost mirrors Camus's findings - that the question of suicide is the main philosophical question, and that life is meaningless (but Camus doesn't recommend suicide as the answer, unlike Satre at times).\n\nIs that okay? \nOr should I focus more on suicide in hamlet's eyes, or from the characters themselves more and ignore Shakespeare? \n\nThanks!",

Can anyone help a stressed english student out? Also open to discussion of the idea :)\n\nThe theory is that Gatsby is seen to be the embodiment of the American Dream, but he actually isn't. This is because although he want from being a poor farm boy to a rich businessman, he had to change his identity in the process, and the American Dream is about people becoming successful regardless of their background. Basically, James Gatz kind of misses the point because he never really achieved the American Dream of going from poor to rich. He actually just became someone else altogether and this new persona (Jay Gastby) was supposedly rich all along, which is not what the American Dream is all about.",

Is it because it is hard (if not impossible) to find good-great translations of his works? Is it because his Romanticism violates the realist decorum that seems to endear itself better to literary critics (hence the praise of Madame Bovary over Les Miserables)? Or is it because Hugo wasn't given the same reappraisal that, say, the American author Herman Melville received after his death?",
