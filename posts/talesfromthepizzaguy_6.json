        "text": "First day I finalized some info on the computer. Then they sent me out on a ride along. Then before I know it, I'm sent out on my first delivery. It hadn't even been an hour since I started. Fortunately, I've worked in food service before, but the systems are still kind of foreign to me. I also labeled boxes and worked the cutting table after only watching someone else do it for thirty seconds. The second day was the same. \n\nToday was my third day. Delivering, I've got down. Cutting, Ive also got too, but I'm trying to make sense figuring out the labels on my own. I messed up on one pizza because I put garlic sauce on the crust, but the label had 'ngc' (no garlic crust) in tiny print which I didn't see nor would I know what it means because I haven't been trained yet. The phone rang today and people looked at me as if they wanted me to answer it. I wanted to look back at them as to tell them that no one has taught me how to take orders or use the computer. I've used POS systems before, but a brand new system to me might as well be in Russian. I can learn it but it'll be faster if someone teaches it to me. I ended up completing the order after about 5 minutes.\n\nSo far not so bad. I've only been averaging 2 deliveries per hour. I would like to get about 4. By my calculations, which I'm very good at, I'm making around $11 an hour, which includes what I calculated my paycheck will be. For me to do this long term, I need $15+ an hour. ",

Since the remake was free there was no receipt or anything. I get there and she doesn't tip me because I didn't have a receipt for her to sign a tip onto. Well a few days ago I took a call and it was the same woman asking who the driver was who took the pizza. I was confused at first and then completely remembered the scenario. She asked for specifically me to come and deliver it so she could tip me for the last time she couldn't. Made my day. There's a few addresses I've delivered to a good three or so times that have never tipped and this girl in a rehab center called specifically for me to deliver so she could make up for the last one. Never had a customer go out of their way like that. That's about all there is to it but I thought it was super cool. ",

        "text": "Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. I'm not the delivery guy, I'm on the receiving end. This happened literally 20 minutes ago.         \n                 \nSo I put in an order for a pizza at 7:30 with Papa Johns. The Papa tracker said estimated 20-30 minutes. So, back to watching the basketball game, expecting to eat soon. Time flew by as I was distracted by the game, and notice its been 40 minutes (8:10) and I get a call from the delivery driver, saying he is lost, so he proceeds to tell me where hes at, which ended up being 2 blocks from my apartment. After asking him where he was, I gave him directions to my apartment. Ended the call and expected him to arrive in 3 or so minutes.                \n            \nWhile continuing to watch the game, I notice 20 more minutes go by, and I call him from the number on the caller ID. He answers and is lost again. So this time I walk out on my balcony, and in a stroke of sheer luck, I catch him driving down my street to my right (hard to miss with the papa johns sign). I tell him to stop, turn around, and take an immediate right, and proceed to the double doors and then buzz me.           \n                 \nI pace around my apartment, waiting for him to buzz up, being genuinely perplexed as to what is going on. So I call him again, (been 10 minutes) shaking my head in disbelief. He doesn't answer. 10 more minutes later, he called me, and says he can't find the unit number. My apartments are 2 buildings that are connected. Hes in the wrong building. So I direct him back to the front doors, and to go up the elevator to the top floor and take a left and keep going straight, and hung up. And then 5 more minutes go by so I call him again and hes at 271, and doesn't see 269. I tell him to turn around and go all the way back to the elevator, you took a right not a left... \n           \nAt this point he does finally make it to my unit. I open the door, his eyes are bloodshot, he is sweating heavily. Looks about low 30s. Hands me my pizza without any apologies to my pizza being cold, and then proceeds to ask me for cash, and I told him I payed with a giftcard. So he looks and notices he has the wrong reciept. He finds my reciept, hands it to me, and turns around and walks away. Unfortunely, the $3.50 tip was already taken off on the gift card.         \n                 \nThis whole ordeal took 1 hour and 45 minutes since ordering. I missed most of my basketball game trying to give directions, and pacing around like an idiot. \nDo you think this guy should get fired over something like this? What would you do?",

        "text": "I promise I’m attaching a story, too... but I just want to say my novel about pizza delivery, customers, and middle management is finally out!  I hate advertising (plus it’s against the rules) so I won’t link to it or include the title unless it’s requested.  I’m just excited that it’s finally on shelves and I want to shout at the top of my lungs.  It’s been in the works for a good 7 years.  It’s a fictional story, but all of the stuff that happens to the characters has happened to me or someone I knew.  \n\nAnyway, here’s the story! (I’m not going to post here without telling one.  I posted this in r/talesfromfastfood a few weeks ago but it obviously works better here anyway.)\n\nI call it: A happy ending when you render unto Caesar\n\nIt’s a busy Sunday night at a pizza joint and we have a HUGE delivery order that we got at the last minute. It was like a 10 pizza order. Normally, things like this are reserved for catering and future orders. But there we were. We had to do it. Our system also quoted them 30 minutes. Great.\n\nSo, we rush to get it made and a driver checks out for the delivery. He drives over to the address and arrives at this massive church. He looks at the ticket and there’s no room number, no information about what area of the church it could be in, nothing. Apparently, this church was massive, too. With multiple parking lots. (Also, apparently when he finally walked inside, he walked by an indoor basketball court? That’s not relevant to the story, but it tells you how huge it was.)\nSo, he’s in the parking lot and he decides, whatever, I’ll just walk in and ask someone. \n\nDoors are locked. Perfect.\n\nHe calls the customer on the number he gave us but it goes to voicemail.  He calls me at the store, (I’m the shift manager) and he tells me what’s going on. I tell him to first try to go into the door that the cars are parked next to. He tells me that cars are parked everywhere. At all of the parking lots. Right before I tell him to come back to the store, he gets the call from the customer and hangs up on me. According to my driver, the customer griped at him over the phone and asked him why he was late. Mind you, even after all of this, we still somehow managed to be about 5 minutes early.\n\nSo, the customer has him drive around the building and wait for him to unlock one of the doors. Apparently, the customer is a youth pastor and is holding some sort of youth group party. That explains that. So, my driver gives him the ticket and tells him the amount. (It was a cash order.)\n\nAnd apparently, the customer flips the fuck out. He doesn’t like that he has to pay tax, since it’s for the church. Tax-free orders, as you probably already know, are a huge pain and require a decent amount of paperwork. And that paperwork has to be printed, copied, and saved in the store. Plus, it all has to be done in advance, or at least when the order is placed, since there’s no way to change the amount due in the system after the driver leaves for the delivery. So, my driver tells him that he has to pay it anyway, or he can take the food back. (He already knew he wasn’t getting tipped, so he lost any shred of give-a-shit.) The customer told him to call me.\n\nSo, he called me. He told me what was going on and that he was really, really mad about it. So, I told him to tell the customer that there’s always the option of getting a tax-free order through catering or calling in advance. The customer said no.\n\nAt the store, I’m the only one inside. There’s a line at the register, tickets on the make-table, and all of the other phones were ringing off the hook. I just didn’t have the time to be talking about this.\n\nIn consequence I responded by saying, “So… He’s a church-goer, right?”\n\nHe says, “Yeah.”\n\n“Tell him to burn in hell,” I told him.\nHe sighed and said okay.\n\n… And, I shit you not, as I started to hang up, I could hear my driver telling the customer, “Yeah, my boss says you can burn in hell.”\n\nThey eventually paid it. They rendered unto Caesar. I never got a call about it, which surprised me. They didn’t fill out a survey--and my driver actually made it back in time for our numbers to keep up. It was a happy ending, indeed.\n\nIf violated any rule or if this post seems in bad taste, feel free to remove it or just tell me and I totally will.  ",

The rain of course means nobody wants to go out, so right after the last driver goes home, I get to deal with all the late deliveries to follow, and boy were there some deliveries.\n\n     I pull up to this gigantic house in a really nice subdivision with the customer’s order. Instructions said to take it around back, but upon trying this I realized that both gates were locked and there was no way for me to get to the back yard. At this point I’m getting pretty soaked from the rain. \n\n     I decided to just say fuck it and ring the front doorbell. I waited and waited, probably for at least 3 minutes or so (for a mansion, it’s pretty odd that they didn’t have a front porch, so I’ve been getting soaked this entire time) before this typical looking high school aged private school kid comes to the door. You know the type, blonde hair, pastel shorts, no regard for anyone else. Yeah, *THAT* guy.\n\n     Before I could even finish telling him his total ($26 and some change) he informs me that he only has $23 and asks if that’s okay, and if I can spot him $2.\n\n     I told him that I didn’t come to work to spot people money, and that his options were either to come up with the total, or cancel the order. He didn’t like that, and started bitching me out over $2 that *HE DIDN’T HAVE*\n\n     He ended up calling the store and paying for the rest on his card, all the while I’m standing out in the rain. He was considerate enough to tell my manager on the phone to leave me $1.50 tip. \n\n     I told him that next time he wants to order in the pouring rain, the least he could do is actually have the money for it. Come on people, it’s not that hard. \n\n",

        "text": "So, I used to co-own a little pizza place that was mostly delivery. We bought the store for cheap as it was failing pretty badly. My partner and I worked open to close every day (him  running in store and me delivering) in order to keep costs down as we worked to turn the business around. \n\nOne slow Tuesday night I took an order for a delivery from an intoxicated gentleman. My partner was in the back doing prep for the next day, so I made the pizza, cut it, boxed it and delivered it. I get back to the store and receive a call from the customer stating he received the wrong order and wants a freebie. I repeat the order to him (as I had already done when he placed the order) and he says that's correct, but not what he received. Since it was the only order for a while there and I'm the only person who had anything to do with the order, I'm pretty confident he's lying. But, hey, maybe I made a mistake. So, I tell him about our policy for incorrect orders, which is to bring out a replacement pizza as long as at least half of the incorrect order is remaining (we want proof it's incorrect, and we figure other people in the house might eat some of the pie without realizing it's wrong before the person who ordered notices). He tells me that they already ate the whole thing. I tell him \"I'm sorry but I can't do anything for you\". He asks to speak to the manager. I tell him I'm the owner. He starts getting belligerent so I accuse him of trying to scam us and explain that I took his order, made it, delivered it, etc... He then threatens to \"come down there and blow up the building\". I laugh and tell him \"well, now you're banned for life and I have to call the police\" and hang up on him. Call the police and let them know what he said and that I don't believe it's a legit threat, but want to err on the side of caution. Cops tell me they'll go have a talk with him. I put him in the computer as \"No orders; bomb threat\". \n\nAbout  2 weeks later he calls in to try to order again, though this time he doesn't sound completely shit faced. I explain to him that he's banned for life due to threatening to blow up our building and trying to scam free pizza. He doesn't recall the incident at all and begs to let him order. Nope, sorry bud.",

Go in and there are like 75 pizzas waiting to go through the oven, 3 large orders are for me and 2 for another driver. \n\nI took the first 2. 13 and 16 pizzas. First one went fine, second one the lady waves me down before i leave \"you shorted us\" blah blah. No we did not, we triple checked. After like 10 minutes, we find out that in the maybe 90 seconds it took to get the big bags loaded back in my car and get the check from the lady, some teacher (small private school) had taken 3 to her class already. Well the checks were in sealed envelopes, and so they shorted us like $15. Ugh. (edit 2: manager dealt with this and we might not deliver there anymore, but I didn't have to pay the difference since it was in a sealed envelope.)\n\nNext big order. City hall, wayyyyyyy outside our delivery area, like a 20 minute drive. 10 pizzas only so not that bad, but they were all specialties so it was heavy as fuck. Well I get downtown (i hate going downtown) and the only parking is across the street. So I bring the 10 pizzas across the street, then the security guard tells me the wrong direction to go and I get lost in the building for like 5 minutes. The order is already 10 minutes late, $100 order and same as the first two (and the other small delivery I took) no tip. 41 pizzas before i got any tips at all, and because of all the heavy lifting my arms are basically limp noodles by the time I get back to the store. \n\nLike one other order tipped me all day.\n\nOn one of my regular deliveries after the big orders, the lady comes to the door and something starts flying around my face (i thought) so i took my hat off so slap at it. Nope it's just a spider running around on my hat. Sorry bro but today has been shitty already, you have to go. Wouldn't leave (and I couldn't just knock or blow him off) so I had to kill him. Also no tip.\n\nThen, of course, it started raining, getting worse and worse till flash flood warning. Still in effect even.\n\nGrand total today was 54 pizzas, I went home with $19 after everything (edit 1: i still get my wages in my paycheck, but this is my per run money and tip money). What the fuck.\n\nedit 3, positive update: Tonight I got to go see my little brother graduate from high school though! And even though there were major traffic jams because of the storm, making a 20 minute drive take 65, and delaying the start of the ceremony by like 45 minutes, that definitely made today a lot better",

I recently started driving for Uber and thought I would share a story about an asshole customer.\n\nSo I’m driving around one night, and I get a delivery. I go to the restaurant, pick up the order, then drive to the address given on the app. When I get there, I receive a call from the customer. He says that he is not at the address given in the app; he is at an address about ten minutes away. I agree to bring him his food, but on the way I start getting angry: what if this customer is gaming the app in order to pay less in delivery fees? (For Uber eats the delivery charge is based on distance). So I get to the address he gave me and knock a few times over the course of a couple minutes, and there’s no answer. So I call him, and he finally comes out. At this point I’ve sunk about twenty to twenty five minutes into this one customer, all for a 4.50 delivery fee paid to me. So I tell him that most Uber Eats drivers aren’t going to put up with the customer not being at the address in the app, and then I say that I am expecting a tip, because I had to drive to multiple places and I’m not getting compensated for all this extra driving I am doing just to get him his food. He seems pissy and tells me the app wouldn’t let him change the address. I blow him off and leave, then check the app a few minutes later. Guess how much he tipped me? $0.01 one fucking cent. Plus he gave me a bad review, and made a comment about my lack of professionalism.\n\nI have his number and his address memorized; I was going to post it on Craigslist personals but I guess that isn’t a thing anymore. If y’all have any suggestions as to how to get back at him I would appreciate them. This happened a few days ago and I’m still pissed.",

        "text": "I used to work at a Hizza Put in a relatively big area and recently I started working in a small quiet town which means the amount of driving I actually do and rushes aren't near as big as they were before.  With this being said, what used to be 4-5 drivers a shift has now turned into 1 maybe 2 at most which isn't bad but it can get busy at times.  Today was abnormally busy and for some reason nobody could come in to help and the only other people who were scheduled to drive called out for, in my opinion, the stupidest excuses I could ever think of but that's besides the point.\n\nSince moving to this small town, I have been surprised at the amount of times people pay in exact change.  I'm not talking about not tipping on a credit card, I'm talking about straight pennies, dimes and nickles. To add on to this, when I can't give them exact change if they overpay a couple cents because I don't carry around loose change when I work, they get absolutely LIVID because of it.  I maybe had to deal with this once or twice every month at the big store but now I deal with it on a pretty consistent basis here.\n\nThroughout the rush today Mother Nature decided that the earth wasn't wet enough and proceeded to lay down all holy hell of rain.  This on top of the fact that people were still paying in exact change were pissing me off beyond belief.  After about 4 in a row I just gave up on being courteous and just kinda went through the motions just to get away from the customers.  The rush was starting to dwindle down and as I was finishing up a triple delivery I was walking back to my car from yet another one of these occurrences when I heard a kid, maybe around 7-9 yelled, \"Hey Hizza Put dude!!\" At this point I thought I had fucked something up and was getting prepared for the worst when the kid hands me two quarters.  He looks at me and says, \"Sorry my parents didn't tip you. It's not much, but it's all I have in my piggy bank.\"\n\nI know many of you will doubt the fact a kid this young said this, but it shocked the ever-loving hell out of me too.  I just kind of looked dumb-founded at the 2 quarters and was about to hand them back when he cuts me off and says, \"Gotta go, foods waiting,\" and left.  I don't think I've had a positive mood swing like that ever while I was working at Hizza Put.  Definitely made the rest of the shift go by much faster.\n\n**TL;DR:** Parents stiffed me on a tip and a kid brought me a 50 cent tip that changed my entire mood the rest of my shift.",

It also gets slightly worse MPG.\n\nI prefer the expedition because for all the damage it's still a monster of a vehicle. Great handling, great performance, a ton of space, etc. Plus if for some reason it's wrecked I'm only out maybe a grand or so.\n\nReverse aside, it's mechanically sound. It just looks incredibly ugly. Does Pizzahut have regulations on how a vehicle must look?

        "text": "This was almost a decade ago, in a small NorCal town. The town had recently been voted the worst place to live in the US, mostly because of the large percentage of meth users. \n\nMy coworker, let’s call him Jonah, didn’t keep his nose clean. He was 19 yo, and he was WILD. He was a thug, by definition. Even so, liked him back then. I thought he was really funny, he did his share of the work, and when he wasn’t coming down off his meth benders, or coming in with fighting wounds, or robbing other dealers, a good guy. Didn’t trust him too much, but I trusted Jonah to be Jonah. \n\nThe place we worked at was similar to Round Table, and this place was a privately owned franchise. The owner was a middle aged lady, but she was never really around and she didn’t know how to make pizza. She had cameras and she would call us if she caught us doing something she didn’t like. But trust me, we were still getting down in there. Everyone smoked weed, a few of us would drink from the kegs, a fewer sold weed/pizza/other contraband out of the back door. Fun times, but pretty greasy.\n\nAnyways, Jonah had a pretty girlfriend. He had a nice stepside Chevy, and she would wait in there for him. One night I came back from a delivery, and she wasn’t in his truck when I got there. Karen must have gone to sit inside. I went in thru the back and checked back in from delivery on one of the POSs. I saw her in a corner booth, and there was a loud table of about 6 customers next to her. It was weird because the rest of the store was empty. She was reading a book, if I remember, and trying to ignore them. \n\nThese customers were annnnoooyyyyiinnggg. They were they dressed like they were from the Bay Area, and still doing the hyphy look. what was annoying is how much attention they seemed to think they deserved. they simply thought they were cool, and they weren’t. One of the girls on their table came up and told me I’m hella cute, and then gave a lingering look as she walked away, while her other girl friend also stared at me from their table. They were all drugged up from what I could tell, and I really wasn’t interested.. The dudes at the table were all hootin and hollering, laughing, and I could hear that nothing they were saying was that funny. \n\nAnyways, one of the guys gets up and starts talking to Karen. I don’t know what he said, but she only put up with him a few seconds before she told him off. Now his other goon friend comes to his aid and starts talking to her too, and she tells him off also. Karen was tough, and I knew she could talk shit, because she had done it to me before..\n\nAs this confrontation was occurring, me and Albert, another coworker, looked at each other and knew trouble was brewing. Jonah was a little off his rocker that day, very hyped up if you catch my drift. So Jonah storms to the lobby and asks the table if there was a problem. The big guy at the table says no, did Jonah want a problem? Jonah says he’ll take whatever they got for him, cause they seem to be giving his girl a bad time. This goes back and forth for a while, and our manager went up and yelled at Jonah to go in the back, as she gave the table a box for their leftovers, asking them to leave. Everyone involved was already pissed, and Jonah had to be dragged to the kitchen, while smallest of the table said “fuck this stupid ass town anyways, it’s the 650 in this bitch we’ll blast all you faggots” . Me and Albert had a laugh at that. Jonah met that threat by throwing some plastic plates at them. The vibe in the restaurant in fight mode, im surprised it hadnt happened yet.\n\nThey eventually leave. The manager is livid, screaming at Jonah, and telling him to stay inside until they left,  after which he had to go home. Meanwhile, I kept an eye on the table members as they piled into their Buick, because if any shots started popping I was gonna be behind something brick. They peeled away, and we all went to the back for a smoke break. We were partly still giddy, partly relieved. \n\nAbout 5 minutes after we went outside , we see the same car pull back into the parking lot. They had forgotten their leftovers, apparently. Jonah was inside the restaurant, and me and Albert were outside leaning on my truck. Jonah runs out to my truck and says hey lemme borrow this. I had a few tools in the cab of my truck, and he knew they were there, he had borrowed them before, He grabbed a big socket wrench. I remember thinking, “wow a wrench to a gun fight, you are crazy”. Jonah then runs back in, grabs the pizza and runs out to meet the Buick. The girl told him they just wanted their food, no problems, but Jonah wasn’t listening. The way he rushed the car made the men in it step out, in as aggressive a manner. \n\nBefore anyone could make a move, Jonah flung this large pizza at them like a discus, hitting the first guy in the chest. a second guy stepped to Jonah and threw a right hook, missed, and Jonah countered with a swing of the wrench. He caught him on the side of the head with an audible THHCKK!! The guy staggered and grabbed his ear, and the other men got between him and Jonah, but no one swung again. It turned into a standoff, with about six feet between them and us, because we couldn’t let Jonah get jumped (we were all pretty close as coworkers, but trust me I wasn’t down to start brawling if I thought someone had a gun). The girls on both teams eventually herded the guys away from each other, amidst the fuck yous and the slurs being screamed at each other. It was a shit show.\n\nAfter they left again, we were all worked up. Jonah got sent home(not fired), and we all spent the rest of the night cleaning, expecting the police or a gun shot.. I can’t believe the guy didn’t go down after that wrench hit, it was a clean hit, and Jonah was 6”1, 200 lbs.. It was the most tense situation I was part of while I worked there, but there was definitely a lot of good and bad times there. Tons of characters, learned a lot, and paid my rent while I started college.\n\nTl;dr: Drugged up customers upset coworkers girlfriend as she waited for him to get off work, a confrontation occurred and my coworker hit one of them a large wrench.

        "text": "I just want to preface this by saying I am grateful for 99.9% of the tips I get, I don't even get mad when I get stiffed. I dont care if the tip is big or small, cash or card, a bunch of quarters, whatever, as long as it's money (had some people offer me weed before, politely declined those). I still get worked up over this one from months ago.    \n\nSo let's rewind to last summer, I'm working an opening shift on a weekday, I get a delivery to a guy who I knew wasn't a good tipper but whatever, I was just happy to get out of the store and away from my annoying shift manager (who deserves a ranting post about her, but that's for another time).   \n\nSo I show up a couple minutes ahead of schedule, walk up, ring the doorbell, wait a bit, knock, wait again, ring again, he answers the door like 30 seconds later. Then he hands me exact change, which I more or less expected, but oh well, it happens.   \n\nThen, he tells me to wait a second while he goes to get the tip. Not sure why he didnt have it with him already if it took so long to answer the door, but I'm fuckin giddy. I'm thinking that karma is finally working out and I'm gonna get a big tip to make up for all his shitty ones. He left the door open so I see him turn the corner on his way back and notice he has a $10 bill in his hand. I'm jumping for joy on the inside. He extends his hand, I go to extend mine. But then, this motherfucker took his other hand and put 96 cents worth of coins in my hand then shut the door.   \n\nAt first I was just stunned, but then I got heated when I realized he only got the $10 for the sake of dicking with me.  \n\nFuck him. I hope he got a piece of pepperoni stuck in his teeth and couldn't find a toothpick.   \n\nEdit: ended up blocking his address not long after that incident. Also. Damn. Yall are fucking vindictive ",

I return to you all with... this...  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n  \nCustomer rings up, orders pizza, all is normal enough. After the allotted 20 mins, I am out the front folding boxes (high-octane task, that is) and I turn around to see some kid, 5 - 10 years old (I'm rubbish at estimating ages) standing at the front counter. Let the hilarity ensue:\n  \nMe: How's it going, man?  \nKid: Uhh... 'order for [Customer]'.  \nMe: Alrighty.  \n*I grab the appropriate order off the top of the oven*  \nMe: And that's [However much it costs, about $30 or so]  \n*Kid puts a rock on the counter*  \nMe (with a half-humourous, half-concerned grin): That's... not quite enough to pay for the pizza.  \n*This is the bit where many of you will find your nearest wall and bash your head against it*  \nThe kid walks outside, grabs a few pieces of gravel, comes back in and puts that on the counter too. I look at him and say, \"Mate, perhaps best if you grab your parent, whoever's with you.\"  \nHe goes outside, and after a few minutes, he and his mum walk back in. She is using the classic plan of: 'If I appear extremely angry, they will give me what I want.' Can't fail, can it?  \n  \nMum: WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO COME IN HERE I SENT MY SON IN TO DO IT FOR ME WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT MONEY FROM A CHILD ARE YOU ALL RETARDED WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU   *(Not certain on the exact wording, but you all get the idea - she ain't happy)*  \nI should point out that it is about 8:45 at night, I have been here for 5 hours so far, and this is not included in my sense of humour.  \nI look her dead in the eye and say with no small amount of projection in my voice:  \n\"Calm down or get out.\"  \nUnexpectedly enough, she shuts up.  \nMe: Thank you. Now that we are speaking in a conversational tone, do you have a complaint about the pizza you have not yet received?   *(Yes, I'm a sarcastic bastard on occasion)*  \nMum: You didn't let him pay for it.  \nMe: He attempted to pay with rocks.   *(My manager was now here, no doubt a bit concerned because of the yelling, but now quite interested)*  \nMum: Yeah? Is that a problem?  \nMe: Now that you bring it up, yes, in fact, it is.  \nMum: What's that?  \nMe: Do you have legal Australian money with which to pay for this food?  \nMum: *Falters* Is this not legal? *Gestures at the rocks*  \nMe: *Shakes head with agonising slowness*  \nMum: Oh God...  \nShe then grabs her kid by the shoulders and quickly exits the shop. My manager bursts out laughing once they've gone, we take the pizza to the back room and all present take part in consuming it with pleasure.  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nSo, there's that. I do not know why the lady tried to pay with rocks, why she only just discovered now that it doesn't work, and how in the name of Pagan she has gotten this far in life without using money.  \nUntil the next imbecile, see you all later!  \n  \nUPDATE: As many of you seem to be wondering - yes. She did take the rocks with her during her hurried run from the store. Somethin' wrong with them...",

He has had 3 accidents involving drivers, all within the last year, and I was in 2 of them. Both times, other driver was cited, and my truck was totaled.\n\nFirst one was in September of last year. We have 2 shops, and we transport certain things from the main shop to the little shop. I had just left the main shop and was sitting at a red light a block away, with a gallon jug of ranch dressing riding shotgun. Light turns green. I start pulling forward. Suddenly gravity seems to be coming from another direction. When I got out of the truck, I was covered- COVERED- in ranch dressing from head to toe. My then girlfriend drove me to the ER where I was diagnosed with a concussion. After spending about 4 hours in the hospital reeking of ranch dressing, I was finally able to go home and shower it off. Other driver was cited for running a red light. I missed the next three days of work, but the other driver's insurance reimbursed me for that.\n\nSecond time was in February, I believe. I was turning left off of a main road, and as I was crossing over the other lane, I was T-boned into the ditch. Apparently she had been in my lane, a couple cars behind me, and lost control of her vehicle on the ice, and slid into the other lane. She was cited for failing to control her vehicle and for driving in the wrong lane.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/jnVMSoQ\n\nSilver Ranger was the first one, red Sport Trac the second one.",

I do not like this as the toppings stay soft/soggy. I like crispy pepperoni dangit! I  always request that they put the toppings on top of the cheese when I order, and this goes ok about 80% of the time. The rest of the time they mess it up.  I am never rude about it and they either fix it right then or put a credit for next time on my account. I always feel bad about it and feel like they are annoyed with me.  I always tip very well so they aren't usually to aggravated. My feelings on it are I order pizza 1-2times a month and these are about the only timed I eat out.  I really look forward to it and spend $30-$50 a visit. So when they make it the wrong way it is very disappointing to me. Do you think I am being rude?",

        "text": "My store is a carryout and delivery location only, no dine-in, no buffet, no fountain, no salad. This pisses customers off occasionally because we're not classy enough, but most of them get over it. I've worked here for six months and I've had several incidents that made me question what these people were on. \n\nThe first time I was taking out the garbage after dark, and was busy throwing it in the dumpster right behind the store. My store is in a strip mall, so we're surrounded by a dollar store, a liquor store, and a few other businesses, and it's not obvious which back door is ours from the outside. A soccer mom looking woman pulled up in a minivan and yelled at me out the window \"Hey, where's your drivethrough?\" The area behind the strip mall is also gated, although it's never locked, which is a good indicator you're not supposed to be back there. I told her we don't have a drive through, and she needed to either call the store or walk in personally. She told me to pound sand and screeched off, and the manager was just as clueless as I was as to what she was doing back there. \n\nThe second incident I was returning from a delivery on a busy Friday night and a woman in a shitty ass pickup truck pulled up in a space near me and asked me what she could buy for $3. I told her the only thing we sold less than $5 was bottled drinks, but that obviously wasn't satisfactory. She told me to go talk to my manager, use his authority to get the lowest priced item for less than $3, and she'd expect me to bring it out to her when it was done. I told her I had more deliveries to make, but she was free to go speak to the manager herself. The woman yelled at me again when I came out with a new delivery, but I ignored her. I asked the manager after the rush, and he said the woman never went inside or called in an order. I don't care how poor you are; go inside if you want to look at the menu or complain.\n\nYesterday we weren't busy, and I got stuck answering the phone way more often than I liked. A guy called, asked about the specials, and then said, \"That's it?\" when I was done listing them off, which was an immediate red flag that this guy would be trouble. English was not his first language, and his connection was poor, which led to a lot of hassle in doing his order. He wanted it delivered, and he said he's a trucker at a warehouse a ways away from our store. We get orders from truckers there on occasion, so I put the order through, although I had trouble with his credit card because I could barely hear what he was saying. A different driver ended up taking it, a new girl, and ended up bringing it back to the store because, in her words, \"I took this job to deliver pizza, not play hide and seek.\" Apparently the guy was insisting she drive into the truckers only area and hand it in through his window, and she wasn't having any of that because it was night and there was no way she could see which truck was his, and as we all know, if you take pizza into a crowded area, a ton of douchebags will crowd you trying to claim it's theirs and she didn't feel safe. So she told him if he wanted his food he could come by the store. Well, she returned to the store, and the guy, driving his semi, pulled into the parking lot a minute later, and he was pissed. He claimed all our employees were stupid, and demanded he received his food free for the hassle and reimbursement for his gas. The manager tried to give him store credit, but he turned it down saying it was useless because he would not be back and it didn't pay for his gas. He also got mad because there was no drink on his order, even though he never asked for a drink. All in all, not a fun night, especially after the computer system crashed and we couldn't cash out or dispatch any orders. ",

        "text": "I've seen a few gnarly things while on the road. Luckily nothing that's happened to me (the worst i've had was someone was rolling at like 2 MPH and accidentally bonked my car).\n\n\nSo this happened today. I had just finished training this new girl and was about to start back up with my own deliveries. I drive up to the intersection by our store, and I'm behind this pick-up truck at the stoplight. So I decide to peek at the receipt to make sure I knew where I was going (I'm working on memorizing the area and weaning myself off of the GPS).\n\n\nAs I'm peeking, I hear a loud smack. Nothing too wrong, I guess, maybe someone rear ended someone, it happens a lot (There's an elderly independent living center here, as well as a bunch of college kids, so the combination of kids on their phones and elderly people not aware of the road is a perfect recipe for rear-ending.)\n\n\nSo I look up. As I suspected, I see that someone smacked someone else in the intersection. I'm not sure who was at fault, but I didn't have time to figure it out\n\n\nBecause as this was happening, one of the cars was barreling towards my car.\n\n\nBefore I had time to process it, i heard another smack. Luckily, it wasn't me, it was the car in front of me that got hit.\n\n\nSo I get out, and I swear to god like the entire row of 10 cars behind me all got out and ran out to help. The car in front of me is just kind of stuck there with a blank look of \"are you fucking shitting me\", unable to get out of her car since the other car dented the truck's drivers side.\n\n\nThe guy in the car behind me called the police, and we just kinda made sure that nobody was seriously injured.\n\n\nI just kind of stand there for a bit... I peek over at the other car that was involved, which crashed into a street pole right by the gas station... and... I just kind of figure I'm done here.\n\n\nSo I talk to the guy in the car behind me for a bit, mostly just being like \"damn that was close haha\", before just calling it quits since I couldn't do much.\n\n\nI get a phone call from the store after they see my car driving off, mostly them asking \"what the fuck lmao\", and making sure I wasn't involved.\n\n\nSo after all of this peril, I drive around and see police cars with their sirens driving towards where the accident was.\n\nBut I'm dedicated to my job, so I keep on driving away, making it quickly to the customer's house while still getting there before the promise time.\n\n\nI got exact fucking change.\n\n\nWhat are your guys stories?",

        "text": "While most posts that I've done consist of annoying, unfortunate, or humorous matters, this one will always serve as a reminder to me that there remain good people out there. \n\nI've lived in the area that I deliver in for my entire life and therefore I rarely come across deliveries that I don't at least have some idea of where they are. That failed to be the case on this night. I knew the road and I knew generally where numbers implied the house to be, but when I put it in my GPS, the address was shown to be on a parallel road to the one given, but this parallel road had no name. I decided that instead of freaking out about it at the store, I should just drive out there and see what my eyes could tell me. Worst-case scenario, I'd have to give the customer a call and ask for clarification. \n\nI drive down this unnamed road and see a mailbox with the house number given and am immediately assured that I've arrived at my destination, save for the fact that there was also the number \"1\" provided after the address. I assume that the house is split into separate residences (not uncommon in my area as it's a college town and many houses simply exist as \"dorms\" with several numbers attached to them). I decided that instead of wondering around the outside of the house late at night, I'll just call and have the customer tell me exactly where they are and make my job a bit easier...or so I thought. \n\nI was immediately greeted by someone on the other end of the phone who sounded like she'd rather be doing anything than talking to a guy trying to deliver food, which she ordered. I ask for clarification in regards to the number \"1\" and she replies:\n\n\"So you found XXXX Johnston road? Well I'm at number 1. So just look for the number 1....\"\n\n\"Of course, how foolish of me, I'll do just that  See you shortly.\"\n\nI wonder around the porch which wraps around the entirety of the front of the house and find at door tucked in the corner with the number 1 attached to it. As I approach, a woman appears, hands me cash, accepts the order and I'm on my way. Easy enough, I thought to myself. But I  remember thinking I don't see why she couldn't have just said, \"Yeah, walk to the left on the porch and you'll see my door.\" Or something to that extent. After all, I'm only trying to quickly deliver food to her. Well she must have had similar thoughts. \n\nI'm about 5 minutes removed from her house when I see I'm getting a call from her number. After our encounter, I'm bracing for the worst. I'm sure it's her complaining about her order and I prepare to pick up and tell her to just call the store so they can fix the situation for her. Instead, I received an immediate apology. \n\nShe told me she had a bad day and realized she was being less than helpful when I was calling to locate her door. She said she could've been more forthcoming and hoped that I didn't take it personally and hopes that nobody else that night treated me as poorly as she did. I explained to her how much it meant to me to receive that call and that her consideration did not go unappreciated. \n\nIt's amazing how a small gesture can go a long way, I just wish more people were understanding like her. I try to do my job as efficiently as I can, but sometimes I need/want a little assistance and who better to ask than the person who lives there. ",

Not a variety that ranged from good guests to bad guests, one that ranged from shit guests to shittier guests because it is a pretty cheap buffet, especially for what you get. I was working the register one day and two people come up and want the buffet with a drink. I tell them the price and they immediately make a fuss of how expensive it is and ask how much drinks are. I tell them the drink is $1.99 and they reply \"what the hell? That's too expensive! We will just take water.\" So I have to void the order and rering them up because we were still on an older register system at the time, while they continue to complain the whole time about the price. I tell them the new total and the guy proceeds to pull out a STACK of twenties, at least $600. I give him a look, but finish ringing them up and move on because this happens somewhat often. Later I notice they both have coke in their water cups and tell them they can either pay for their drinks or not drink at all. They both cause a scene when I take their drinks away after they refused to pay for them. They bring up the price again and I tell them \"look, you're eating at the cheapest buffet in the region. You can go across the street and pay $15 each for a buffet, down the street for $11 each, or twenty minutes down the road for a couple dollars more, and none of them include drinks.\" This clearly does mean anything to them and it eventually gets to the point where I was done with it and called security and had them removed. I never understood why people complained about the price of a $6 buffet, almost $9 with a drink, especially when there were no other options cheaper. ",

        "text": "I'll preface this by saying I've never delivered pizzas, but a good friend of mine did for quite some time.\n\nA few years ago when I was 19, I worked at a steakhouse and would wait for my friend after work, who worked at a pizza place whose name was similar to Mizza Slut, to get off and go back to his place and hang out with the rest of our friends. My schedule started to differ from his and I'd be getting off a lot earlier than him most days and he'd be stuck at work until close. He would always tell me to just come along for a delivery and wait in the car and then said he would park in the unlit area behind the store when he went to fetch more pizzas, but I didn't want to get him in trouble should anything happen so I didn't.\n\nI noticed that his uniform wasn't all that different than mine; he had a corporate black polo he was given from work with a small emblem that can be covered by a black jacket (and he would often times as it gets cold during our winters), non-slip restaurant style shoes, black Dickies pants, and a corporate hat.\n\nI went to a garage sale one weekend and found the same corporate hat but a few years older and I picked it up for $0.50. I arrived behind his location one night wearing the black polo, Dickies pants, non-slip shoes, black polo, and black jacket and got in the car with him to do deliveries as his \"trainee\". This mostly just consisted of us dicking around, listening to music, talking about life, and delivering pizzas. I'd go up to the door with him and he would introduce me to the customer as his trainee saying it was my \"first day\" (and it was always my *first day*). He would point out to me where good tippers lived and the times where he's nearly been robbed a few times. We hopped gates when the customer failed to provide the code for it and would leave the pizza out of the pizza bag with the windows rolled down in the backseat if the customers were being dicks or attempting scams.\n\nHe normally got better tips because of it and I always liked going just to hang out. I also got free soda and extra pizza that the customers would no-show on. I was reflecting on my life before I moved and realized I missed doing things like this with my friends when we were younger.\n\nAny other similar experiences?",

It was a perfect descriptor of the quality of the store.  It was one of the few locations that still had a dine in lobby area.  It made the closing process far longer than it should have taken but so long as we had more than one closing driver we were usually fine.\n\nEvery Tuesday I would have to close with a guy I'm going to call Jeff.  Jeff was our resident drug dealer.  Every pizza place has at least one.  It's seemingly a constant as though every pizza place is a sitcom with a strict formula.  Normally I like Jeff.  He's fun to talk to and typically he doesn't care enough about taking deliveries (probably due to his alternate income) I could get more deliveries.  However having to close with him is terrible.  Because he does nothing.  Typically he just followed me around and talked.  \n\nOne night in particular we had an extra person there as well.  They were sweeping up.  I was gathering trash while Jeff was talking.  I was in the csr station right to my left was the closet with the water heater and the mops and brooms.  Just to the left of that was the warmer where all the cooked pizzas waiting to be picked up are kept.  Leaning up on the warmer was the second broom.\n\nSo while Jeff is talking to me (because even though he's not doing anything he doesn't get to leave until it's all done) he says \n\nJeff:  yeah man I'd like to do something to help us get outta here but it looks like you all have it covered.\n\nMe:  You could grab the other broom and help sweep.  Then mop.\n\nJeff goes quiet for a moment as I turn to take the trash bag out of the can in the csr station.\n\nJeff:  I don't know man I can't find it.  I have no idea where the other broom is.\n\nI turn around to see him closing the door to the closet.  I then look to the warmer.  The broom is now gone.  I walk over to Jeff and open the closet.  Lo and behold the broom hanging there precisely where he'd put it.\n\nJeff:  What?  Dude I swear to god it was not in there a moment ago.\n\nYeah.  Ok.  I have never worked with someone so dead set on not doing his job before or since.  Anyone else have stories about people who just refused to do their job?",

He essentially told me to not take so many doubles. My average is 2 doubles to 3 singles. His reasoning was I should leave some for the new drivers as one complained about never getting doubles. \n\nOn his own he would never speak to me about it but we have a lot of new people who don't know how things work. So I'm positive someone I told as a reminder that two deliveries to the opposite sides of town aren't a double. He flipped his shit over that, meanwhile his gun was sticking out of his pants.

        "text": "One night I have a delivery to a pretty rural area. A lot of my deliveries are to rural areas, so no big deal. But tonight it's drizzling and especially dark, so I'm having trouble finding the address of the house I'm looking for. So I roll down the passenger window and use my (really fucking bright) flashlight, pointing it at mailboxes/trees/posts/ anything that somebody might have their address on at the end of their driveway. So I'm driving along at like five miles an hour pointing my flashlight when the beam catches a guy wearing a black hoodie at the end of an obviously long gravel road staring directly. At. Me. More of a glare at me, really. But whatever, could just be on the phone or something. Then it gets weirder. I finally find the address I'm looking for and pull into the drive, and hop out of the car. That's when I get the sinking feeling. No cars, no house light, boarded up windows. If you've ever been a delivery person, you know that this is the time to gtfo of there because you're about to get robbed. Right as I'm about to jump in, throw the car into reverse and nope the fuck out of there, I see a man walking across the empty field adjacent to the property towards me. Fuck. Now I'm a pretty burly, bearded dude, so I don't worry a whole lot on deliveries, but this scared the shit out of me. When he gets closer, I see him very obviously tucking something into his waistband, what I can only assume was a gun. He then says in a thick, menacing southern accent \"I thought you was the law\" (I guess because of how I was scanning the addresses). I meekly point to my car topper and the pizza in my hand and he says in the nicest voice you've ever heard \"Oh, great! Thank you so much! Have a great night!\" Pays me, and proceeds to walk back through the open field, in the direction of no buildings, in the rain, with his pizza. For the rest if my shift I couldn't stop whispering \"What. The. Fuck.\" Strangest thing that's ever happened to me.",

This cried out sketchy to me, and they called the store to complain. \n\nThis is the first time I've ever had someone complain in a year and a half so I want to know: Do you guys deliver to rooms of low-quality hotels if there's a front desk?

        "text": "Ok this one may take a little bit.  So I've worked at a number of stores for the same pizza chain and at my first one I was acquainted with a shift manager who for the purposes here we shall call Crabby.  It is most fitting of her personality.  Now I will say that I've heard that she wasn't always like this but by the time I met her she basically went through life incapable of letting herself be happy.  She seemingly preferred to be miserable.  This is fine.  It doesn't affect me.  She can miserable if she wants.  The problem occurs when she starts taking it out on the world or trying to fix things or make it easier on herself with no regard to what it does to other people.\n\nShe didn't like doing her job.  She would leave in the middle of the rush and take hour long smoke breaks.  But worst of all she would increase the delivery time to 2 or 3 hours.  This meant that people would cancel their orders.  Which meant fewer deliveries which meant the drivers didn't make as much money.  That's what I had a problem with.  One thing that was somewhat hilarious though is that half the time that she did this she would forget to raise the carryout time so instead of making things easier she just shifted all the orders over to carryout which ultimately made her do even more work.  So that was hilarious but still hurt my bottom line pretty seriously.\n\nOnce I understood that this was a regular thing that she would do I went to the GM and she was pissed.  She went and told her off and it stopped for a little while.  But once it calmed down a couple of weeks later she was at it again.  I told my GM again and nothing happened.  I finally gave up.  Clearly nothing was going to happen while our GM was still there.  Shortly after that though our Area manager turned in his two weeks notice (I'd always seen him as the kind of guy to see which way the wind was blowing) and two days later our GM steps down and our Regional manager was 'seeking other opportunities' which is as polite a way as you can say he got his ass fired hard.  Lots of info came out about sexual misconduct there but that's another story.\n\nSo we get a new GM.  This GM was far better in many ways.  She had a hell of a temper but I didn't care that much because I always did my job and thus I was never on her bad side.  So I tell her about Crabby's little move and she promptly does fuck all about it.  After enough inaction that I realized there was no way that this new GM was going to do anything about it either I gave up and was just trying to transfer to another store.  Then the day finally came.  The day that broke my calm.\n\nI looked around we had four drivers.  One of them was out on a delivery another was on cut table cutting his next order and the other driver and I were standing around folding boxes because there was nothing else to fucking do.  I looked at the screen and there were maybe five or seven deliveries on screen and the delivery time was **2 hours and 45 minutes**\n\nThat was it I was done with it.  I no longer cared if my GM wouldn't do anything.  Now this is where the mention of us having lost not only our area manager and our regional manager comes back into play.  We still did not have an area manager.  So I emailed the brand new Regional Manager.  I laid out what was happening and that I had attempted multiple times to get this corrected through the proper channels.  I come in the next day and one of the other drivers catches me as I'm about to walk in and asks me 'So why does Crabby think you emailed [regional manager] about her'  It came to light later that one of my roommates didn't know how to keep her mouth shut and that's how it leaked.\n\nSo I'm immediately worried about retribution.  I talk about it with the manager that night and the next day I walk in to being written up for not doing prep I know damn well I did.  The manager that night backed me up on it.  But Crabby was the one who opened and said one of the sauces was missing so the GM (who was pissed that I had gone over her head) didn't listen to anything other than she had a chance to write me up.  Thankfully I had friends at another store who trusted me and managed to get me transferred over there pronto.  Otherwise I have no doubt that I would have gotten more trumped up charges on me and eventually fired.\n\nAs for Crabby I heard she managed to quit shortly before the axe came down on her.  There's more to this story later but I think this is enough for part one.",

He couldn't beat the shit out of my niece, and she has a back brace.\n\nAnyway, Creeper came back from a delivery this weekend and decided he wanted to scare Sex Dream Girl (SDG). So while she's out back smoking, he yells \"SDG, run! He's got a gun!\" and continues yelling that he's got a gun until she fucking books it.\n\nNow you may have chuckled at that. Hell, I would have if a friend did it to me. But another pizza place in our city was just robbed at gunpoint, and SDG transferred from a dangerous city where *she was also robbed at gunpoint*. Additionally, *they are not friends*, so there's no way she could have known it was a joke.\n\nSo I'm down a 10:00 driver Wednesdays, if anyone is interested.",

        "text": "Looking to vent on something that happened today. I have been with my chain ~8 months, and today started training for shift lead- something I'm pretty familiar with doing in previous jobs. But that's beside the point. Yay me, though. \n\nMy replacement for the evening shift is usually a burned out husk of a human being. He is clearly a meth addict. He is late for every shift. Every single one. But since it's so hard to keep a cook (we've gone through ~20 in my tenure) he gets a pass on it. His girlfriend is an equally tardy server that got him hired without telling management they were together until after he was hired.\n\nHe laments that his commute is so long that stop lights, traffic, etc keep him from being on time. Here's the kicker. He lives about a 2 minute drive from me. I have been late exactly once in 8 months and have yet to call in. There are also no stop lights at all on our path to work. \n\nSo he's supposed to show up at 4, and, right on cue, calls in 10 minutes before the hour and says he'll be late once again, but he's on his way now. Since I live so near this guy, I know that the commute is 10 minutes pretty much exactly. He turns up 10 minutes late, suggesting that he either didn't leave his nasty trailer (sorry, I needed to get that jab in) until 4, or a 10 minute commute took him double the time. \n\nSo since this is quite literally at least the 15th time he's made me stay late for him, I'm not exactly thrilled. He eventually walks... no, moseys through the threshold with his glassy, stoned eyes, and I immediately untie my apron, look to boss lady, get a thumbs up and go to clock out. As I walk past he says, \"have a good night\". I do not respond, because enough is enough and he deserves to know, in some form, that I'm not okay with his constant tardiness. I also don't care to stick around any longer than I have to off the clock to have a heart to heart with a guy who also once claimed he couldn't come to work because he pinched his sciatic nerve... *in his neck*.\n\nSo as my left foot leaves the tile and hits pavement,  this shit-kicking fuck-brain mutters the word \"douche\" under his breath. \n\n\nHow the fuck do you get to call me a douche when I've logged 1.5 hrs extra in 3 days waiting around for you to show up to work? Not once has he ever apologized to me, either. But, yeah, I'M the douche. \n\nWhew. Sorry for the rant. I want this dude gone so bad.",

I come back and they tell me how difficult this girl was on the phone. Tons of people in the background, didn’t know the address, didn’t know what she wanted, etc. While on the delivery my driver calls me. \n\nDR- driver\nB- bitchy customer\nMe- me.....\n\nDR: This girl is not at 1111 Foxy Lane and won’t answer when I call. \n\nMe: Ok hang on *calls customer*\n\nMe: B, are you sure the address is 1111 Foxy Lane? My driver is there and they didn’t order pizza. \n\nB: No, it’s 1112 Foxy Lane. \n\nMe: Okay that’s a duplex.  Are you on the right or left side? (Bc I knew asking A or B would confuse her)\n\nB: We are on the right. \n\nMe: (to driver) Okay she’s in the duplex next door on the right. \n\nDR: No, she can’t be on the right. That’s Mr. Bob who we deliver to all the time. \n\nMe: Ok try the other side *hang up*\n\n3 minutes later....driver calls again....\n\nDR: No one is answering the door and she hung up on me when I called. \n\nMe: Just come back to the store. \n\n(I proceed to call B again bc I’m like wtf and pissed off)\n\nMe: No one is answering the door at 1112 Foxy Lane. Is that really where you are?\n\nB: Yes, but since I placed my order someone stole my money and I can’t pay for the order. I didn’t want to look dumb so I just didn’t answer. \n\nMe: *rolls eyes bc I’ve heard it all before* Okay that’s fine, just tell us you can’t pay and it’s not a big deal. \n\nB: Don’t get an attitude bitch! *click*\n\nMe: LMFAO \n\n3 minutes later she calls back....\n\nB: (acting all sweet) I just talked to you and couldn’t pay for my order but wanted to know how much it would be for just the wings?\n\nMe: I’m not sure but my driver is already headed back to the store. \n\nB: (getting pissy again) Well, can you tell him to turn around?\n\nMe: No, I won’t be doing that. First, you gave us the wrong address. Then you don’t answer when we get to the correct place. You’ve already cussed at me and wasted 15 minutes of my drivers time. He won’t be turning around. \n\nThe phone erupts with screaming and yelling bc everyone in the background has gone nuts at the same time. \n\nB and friends: Blah blah racist bitch, blah blah it’s your paycheck not mine, blah blah. \n\nI couldn’t make out much of it. All I know is I get paid hourly so nope, not my paycheck and like she was really gonna tip my driver anyway. \n\nThis is just a typical story from my store. Tune in next time.....\n\n",

        "text": "Alright this just happened tonight, I had been making crappy tips for my shift but this made it all worth it.\n\nI call this lady over the phone before I leave because the slip had a town that we normally do not deliver to printed, we'll call that town **Springfield**. I just did not want to drive all the way out there, yknow? So I call her, and I ask if she lives in **Springfield**, and this is where it begins. She starts going on a rant about how her mail keeps being stolen, and she asked me details about everything on the receipt, confirming her name, number, address, and the town written on the slip. I comply because I really just want to get this delivery out of the way. She tells me she lives in a town that we deliver to, we'll call it **Springdale**. She made it very clear she would be there to receive the order.\n\nA quick aside, the names are important here. **Springfield** and **Springdale** are similar names, so it was clearly just a small mistake made by the person taking the order.\n\nI pull up to her house, well, i pull up past it because it was dark out, there were no lights on the road, it was pouring, and the only number on her house was a small dark metal thing that read the word with letters instead of numbers (anyone reading this that has the word instead of the number, please for the love of God...) So i reverse back to her door. She opens the door and her eyes light up. \n\nThere's electronics everywhere, cigarette butts everywhere, trash all over the house. I thought she was crazy over the phone, but this is a looneyhole. Her looks fit her craziness, as well. She pays for the pizza, $1 tip, not too disappointed because the whole night was like this. I am about to leave but then she just starts with her story.\n\nShe talks about the receipt, and she asks me to confirm that it says her address and **Springfield** on the receipt, it does, I was not lying. She then gives me a visual tour of her findings. She claims the government has been hacking her, hacking her through her mobile service providers. Providers plural, the lady had three separate ones with four separate phones. She says that she used her hack phone to order the pizza so that the government could not track it, but because the receipt said **Springfield** instead of **Springdale**, even her hack phone flip phone was being spied on. Now her paranoia does not end here. She has SIM cards plugged into the USB blocks connected via clamps and wires, trying to extract data from the SIM cards so that she cannot be tracked. She shows me her laptop sitting sideways on her couch that has been updating Windows at 42% for a little while now. She said that she knew that her mobile service providers were keeping it at that number because she was being hacked, she said she went as far as to call them about it and insult them for their wrongdoings. This lady is off her rocker.\n\nYou're probably wondering the cause of her paranoia.\n\nShe told me, with a hand placed on my chest, that her husband is dead, no, *murdered*, and the government is trying to keep his identity alive. His fake address is her address but in **Springfield** instead of **Springdale**, the same address on the receipt. This connects to her mail being stolen, and her findings with her four phones and three service providers. \n\nHer penultimate remark to me is a question. She asks me for two things. She asks for my name, and for the receipt. I give her a fake name and the receipt because I am not sure what to do at this point. She thanks me kindly and says that she will use the receipt, along with her hack phone and laptop, to take her service providers to court and win the case. That case I am not sure the point of, but what she does is what she does.\n\nOh yeah, she also said she would tip me kindly the next time she got me on a delivery, so that's pretty cool I guess.",

Our store is a little over an hour away from Chicago, so as you can imagine, lots of pizza places around.    \nAbout 10 pm on a Friday night, I answer the phone and take an order for delivery, nothing out of the ordinary, pretty plain order, think it was like a large hand tossed pepperoni and a 2 liter of Pepsi.   \nGets made and all that good stuff so I leave to take it. When I turn on to the customers street I see police lights near the end of the street. The GPS was spazzing out but I knew in my heart that the delivery would be at the house with the cops, and I was right.  \nI parked a decent ways away and started walking over. As I get close, I see one officer searching a dude bent over one of the cars and another with his hand on his pistol.   \nOfficer doing the search sees me and asks what the hell I was doing there. I tell her I have a pizza delivery for that address. She replies with \"that's hilarious\" in the most deadpan voice I've ever heard.   \nShe asks for the name on the ticket, I tell her. Luckily the person who ordered wasnt the one being arrested. They have the customer come out to get the food. Guy getting arrested starts yelling at her, she starts yelling at him, cops yell at everybody, I'm uncomfortable.   \nShe was nice and apologetic and left a $10 tip. When making small talk though, she said something along the lines of \"Yeah, I'm visiting from Indiana and wanted to try authentic Chicago style pizza.\" Which honestly left me with more questions than anything else that had just gone down.   \nTL;DR: Delivered pizza to lady while dude at her house was getting arrested.
