        "url": "http://Boss/Landlord has ever-changing rules and at times issues punishments. Some of my possessions were taken tonight.\n\nHello all,\nPlease let me know if you need more information as this is my first time posting here. I'm worried about anonymity because of the nature of my concern.\n\nI live in North Dakota for reference. I moved into my current housing in September of last year. A prerequisite is that I work for my employer to live in this property. I did not sign any lease agreement paperwork at the time, to my knowledge. However,  the updated company contract states that we are not to discuss our rent or other housing arrangements with non-employees. \n\nThere are currently 3 others living in this household (two bed/1 bath with shared rooms). 2 of the housemates will move out soon as our boss employs both full time and seasonal workers.\n\nI feel that there are several major issues in the house but I don't know if I have any rights due to my lack of paperwork. \n\n1) I do not possess a key to my room within the house. I have been locked out and required to ask my boss to let me in. I am not able to protect my belongings while I am away.\n\n2) Our house in general is never locked and I do not have a house key. I was also locked out of the house and due to the time of night, required to find a bed in a friend's house. There are multiple firearms in the home and this seems like a huge security risk.\n\n My foremost question relates to an incident that happened tonight. My boss requires room inspections. I was at work this evening and was not present but was relayed this information by my roommate. Irate that the laundry room was too messy, our boss filled trash bags with clothing and confiscated the items. A large majority of the clothing taken was mine but there were other garments mixed in as well.\n\nI can provide documentation and examples of other things. For now, I'd like to know how to get my things back without being forced to argue with my boss. \n\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/96wumq/bosslandlord_has_everchanging_rules_and_at_times/",
