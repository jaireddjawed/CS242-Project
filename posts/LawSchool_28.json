        "text": "I’m a 1L and I’m taking criminal law this semester. I’m looking for general advice from current law students who have also taken the course and done well in it. \n\nI read the cases, and brief them, but my professor always ends up asking seemingly “unanswerable” questions - he’s looking for a very specific answer, and my response is always off. No matter how much I prepare for class, or how long I spend reading and understanding the court opinions, I needs seem to fully grasp what the professor expects us to know about the topic, which makes me think that I’m focusing too much on the wrong thing.\n\nCan anyone provide any guidance on how to do well in criminal law? What is best to focus on when reading the cases, supplements to the readings that help understand the concepts, etc.?",

Practices like this don't exactly advertise for associates or interns, or anything other than for clients really.

Anyone know of it happening? Seems like it would discredit you pretty quickly if it came out in court, and the defense could use it against you. Seems like it would be a little hypocritical too. \n\nDisclaimer: this question is just out of curiosity, not anything I'm basing a potential career around",

        "text": "First, I recognize this is a privileged and good dilemma to have but I need advice nonetheless. \n\nSo, I was offered a 1L SA position in a decently large Midwest firm…think top 200’s. The offer expires at the end of next week and they do not give extensions (I’ve asked). \n\nHowever this weekend I was offered to interview at two v10 firms for 1L SA positions but the interviews aren’t scheduled until the first week of February. \n\nMy thinking is that I accept the Midwest position, and then if somehow I get accepted at the v10 firm I just rescind my acceptance to the Midwest firm. My reasoning:\n\n1.) I will never move to that Midwest city; or any of the Midwest firms office locations at any point in my life. \n\n1B.) The offer letter indicates at-will employment….so there’s nothing legally binding me to the offer. \n\n2.) I likely won’t interact with any of the Midwest attorneys at any point in my career.\n\n3.) The v10 firms align with want I want to do long term; regarding practice groups, international office locations, etc. \n\n4.) obviously pay is a factor \n\n5.) The v10 firms have a good pipeline to 2L summer and then associate. (The Midwest firm has this too but again I don’t want to practice in those cities).\n\n\nI’ve talked to my career office about this; and I feel like I simply can’t trust them to put my interests before the school. They stated that it would reflect poorly on the school, my classmates, and myself in my law career journey if I was to rescind an acceptance….but because of the facts listed above and the fact that my law school doesn’t really send anyone to regional law firms (big law factory) I can’t really see it being that big of a deal…am I wrong? Any advice would be helpful and appreciated thank you!",

(Though median grades are a fantastic accomplishment)\n\nMy first semester I worked my ass off, did a crazy amount of practice, read E&amp;Es, went to office hours, and so on and got 1 A and the rest B’s (school curves to a B). \n\nThe second semester I improved a little (3 As, 2 Bs) but I still felt disappointed for the amount of work I put in. \n\nThis semester:\nI did none of the readings for one of my doctrinal classes, worked a non-law job in my spare time, and competed in an appellate brief competition and yet pulled off all A’s in my classes (with two heavy doctrinal subjects, one writing based class, and one special interest doctrinal class).\n\nHere’s what I did differently:\n- I made flowcharts for the doctrinal classes\n- I only studied from 9-5 during the reading days (some days less)\n- I did less practice exams and instead focused on understanding how the high scoring past exams for the class were different from the average exams \n- I let my personality show a little in my writing, particularly on policy questions \n\nI’m sure I also felt less pressure because I already landed a summer position that I am ecstatic about- so there was no need to panic if I did poorly.\n\nThis also goes to show that (1) you can improve without overworking yourself and (2) there is no secret formula to improving. What worked for me may not work for others, but I’m proud that I figured out how I learn best.",

How many hours a week did you work?\n\nI currently work at a small firm doing doc review, research, drafting demand letters, occasionally accompanying clients to auxiliary meetings, and some admin-type tasks. Basically, I do law clerk work plus some admin and get to also do client-facing work they don't trust clerks to do. It's a good gig. They've asked me to continue working remotely for them during 1L, and I've said I would consider limited remote work. \n\nDo I have time for this during 1L? I'm nontraditional and have a pretty stressful, overcommitted life, so I'm used to hectic work demands and managing a tight schedule. I don't want to work for this firm after graduation because I've realized small firm culture/life is def not for me. However, one of the partners is extremely powerful and basically dominates our practice area, and I'm afraid they'll blacklist me in this very niche practice area if I don't agree to keep working. I have no interest in working outside this niche area and it is the prime reason I'm heading to law school in the fall.\n\nAND my longer-term goal is to try and position myself to get a 1L SA position at the firm representing our primary conflict. I'm worried that if I leave the current firm before law school, that will give them too much time and opportunity to feel slighted and potentially ruin the good reputation I've built working with the Biglaw firm's partners who seem to really enjoy and respect me.\n\nI'm a bit worried working might impact my grades but that quitting will impact my trajectory.",
