Why people have always treated me differently to how I would be, qualities stacked up \"on paper\".\n\nFor context, I'm 6'2, I'm naturally well-built male, I've always taken care to not be openly vain or too forthcoming with my vulnerabilities and shortcomings (only sharing if I felt it made it easier for others to relax around me), and I recall people have described me as \"intelligent\" and \"good looking\" on numerous occasions (I mean, mainly my Mum lol, but not only her). I've been told also many times that I have a deep voice (so it's not like a high, effeminate voice and manner is the missing puzzle piece here either).\n\nI'm at a loss, therefore, to explain why I've always been treated like some beta (for want of a better word) by women and men (and work colleagues) alike. Other men seem to always talk down to me (including much younger/smaller/shorter guys) and women usually look at me in disgust whenever I approach. \n\nMaybe it's all in my head, but time has told me that I really don't think it is, and it's shot my confidence. I don't feel comfortable around other people or trying to assert myself anymore.\n\nMy question(s) is then, for those of you that have, how did you learn to overcome these feelings and have confidence in yourself regardless of your reception to other people? \n\nAnd what changes did you make that made people start treating you better and with more respect (or did you find solace within yourself that meant you no longer needed it)?\n\nThanks üôè",

I've been running from it for a long while- but I've finally opened myself up to accepting what my actions make me. And the guilt is tearing me to pieces. I fucking hate it. I hate what I did and I hate myself for it. I feel evil. I *AM* evil. It feels so inescapable and I can't go to the people I've wronged and apologize because the best thing to do is distance myself from them as far as possible.  \n\n\nI feel evil. Unworthy of forgiveness. I don't want to die or hurt myself, but the thought floats around in my head- but the prevailing one is that this will haunt me for the rest of my life. Even if I were to live on, I feel so undeserving of the happiness I'd have. The moments where the thought doesn't haunt me. The friends I have. God, I can't tell my friends oir family about any of it either. If anyone in my friend groups or family were to know what I did I'd be exiled. And I feel selfish for not telling them.  \n\n\nI have tried to make a step in the right direction. I applied for some help from an organization that does short-term therapy, and they'll point me in the right direction. And I will NEVER. EVER. allow me to do what I did ever again.

        "text": "My story‚Ä¶.(fragmented)\n\nMy childhood is a really big source of pain for me. Not necessarily because I was ever physically abused, but because of the emotional traumas that have haunted me into my adulthood. \n\nHaving a neurodivergent parent with a number of very hurtful manipulative tendencies really did a deal to me, and I never felt that anything I accomplished was enough for him. My dad drank a lot when I was younger, and would tear me down verbally, until I was in my knees sobbing for forgiveness, for things that really weren‚Äôt even so bad in the first place. Sure, I have said a number of disrespectful things myself, as many kids do, but the words that constantly run through my mind from my dads lips are sharp, painful, and shattering. ‚ÄúScum of the earth‚Äù, ‚Äúderanged‚Äù and oh yeah, the time he yelled ‚Äúbitch‚Äù at me 17 times and wouldn‚Äôt even let me close my own bedroom door to just get some space from the spit and hurtful words being screamed at me. \n\nAlcoholism really was the source of it for the longest time. And a whole hand of DUIs will definitely take its toll on a family, in every way. Luckily when I was like 19, after yet another legal incident drunk, he stopped and had since been sober. But I swear, every time we get into arguments, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be his reason for relapsing. My parents don‚Äôt really have hobbies, or any friends, thus when things go awry in our dysfunction, it really messes everyone up on a pretty deeply embedded level. \n\nSure, I guess these moments aren‚Äôt so major. But there‚Äôs an infinite number of moments less significant, or memorable. Probably because I‚Äôve tried to block a lot of them out. At the age of 12, I had a full blown eating disorder that no one really saw at first, and in my states of depression as an adult, like right now, those tendencies really come back‚Äîand with a vengeance. \n\nMy parents had the worst relationship I‚Äôve ever seen, and for a while I never thought they would last. But financially, they really can‚Äôt survive without each other. So I guess that‚Äôs what it is now. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm living in, a home that‚Äôs tried to heal, yet there is so much unaddressed trauma that nothing really has gotten better. I am crushed daily watching my parents work so damn hard, over 15 hours a day, for a salary supposed to support 4 people, yet is only a minimum wage for one person in Denver. \n\nMy parents have done a lot for me, which is why I feel so bad I even have feelings of pain, trauma, or conflicts with them and/or against them. They sold water at sporting events in the city when I was 12, which really showed me how much they would do for their kids. I know at the end of the day there‚Äôs so much love there, but I can‚Äôt just forget the pain. I‚Äôve tried many many times, but my brain is so fucked up from years of it that I can‚Äôt fix it. \n\nMy first relationship, and only one of two I‚Äôve ever had, was completely shattering and dehumanizing too. I was shamed for everything I did, and gave up all of who I was for a guy who ended up hurting me in the end. I‚Äôve always felt that I‚Äôve just been a burden for everyone in my life, and honestly that feeling has been festering in me more than ever the last few months. \n\nI dropped out of college this time last year, in efforts to take a bet on myself in tech. I ended the year having completed two coding bootcamps, and 3 months later and 300+ job applications, I‚Äôm out of luck in regards to finding any job as a software engineer. I know I have so much to offer the world, in terms of ideas, and creative ability, and charisma‚Ä¶.but none of that matters, apparently without a degree, as a Hispanic woman. I legitimately had a great interview on the phone with a possible job yesterday, the first possibility in months, just to be called again 5 minutes later and asked: ‚Äúyou have your bachelor‚Äôs degree right?‚Äù\n\nNice. \n\nAnd yes, I can get another job, like waitressing just to help me get out of this rut. And I‚Äôm pretty much at that point, the only kicker there is I won‚Äôt have any time to really code as most of the time outside of the time I‚Äôd be working, I‚Äôm driving an hour to escape my parents and get to my partner‚Äôs apartment. And with making dinner, and going to bed early because he works early, any time for applying to tech jobs as well as keeping my skills up to date and active, is out the window. \n\nI used to try to be a beacon of light for others, to promote my ‚Äúmantra‚Äù or what it used to be, ‚Äútransformation through introspection‚Äù but I really don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôve even lived a life that exemplifies that at all. I‚Äôve tried my hardest to do my own forms and methods of inner work, but I do need professional help and can‚Äôt afford it, which is one obstacle, and because I live with my parents, I have no space of my own to dance wildly, sing loudly, cry deeply or any of that, since they work and run a business from home. That‚Äôs not an excuse, and yes I have and use journals, but it‚Äôs just so breaking when I have a series of good days, or good weeks, and then something happens at home that makes me feel like the 12 year old girl who felt she didn‚Äôt mattered. That wasn‚Äôt allowed to cry, to speak, or to have thoughts of my own. \n\nI am at the point where I feel I don‚Äôt belong anywhere. I have no money. I have no value. I‚Äôm honestly ready to give up. I know within me, there‚Äôs a sad little butterfly who had such big dreams, but with everything going on‚Ä¶.I think she‚Äôs pretty much dying. \n\nI don‚Äôt really know what to do to keep her alive. I thought I was making some progress, but with no ability to change my actual physical location or job situation with schooling due to my complete lack of finances, I am so screwed. I‚Äôd like to think I could make some progress without any, but I can‚Äôt keep living at home as it‚Äôs eating me alive, and any creative project I can work on is likely to end up just like every other one I‚Äôve shared, something no one notices or cares about. \n\nI am broken. I am sad. I am hopeless. Everything I strive for, is thwarted. All of my dreams are crushed. I have no ability to do anything right, and I am broke beyond belief. At 22, I had a lot of goals for myself, and met absolutely none of them. Instead, I‚Äôm now $30,000 in debt, with no job, no degree, and no support. I am so over it. I hope one day, somehow, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. But honestly, I‚Äôve gathered enough experiences to already know that whenever my consciousness feeds back into the collective source, I‚Äôll have done my duty of realizing I am both a beautiful and horrid body of energy, as the whole world is, and I really couldn‚Äôt care at all anymore what happens next.\n\nTLDR - I‚Äôm 22, I moved back home after leaving college to pursue coding, I‚Äôm on my ass broke, unemployed, and I‚Äôm completely hopeless, extremely depressed, and well‚Ä¶over it.",

        "text": "Hi! I got a few questions why I didn‚Äôt have an daily update anymore, so here are 3 days in one! \n\nIt was a little overwhelming for me to write daily to be honest. I‚Äôm still getting used to it and for me these past few days weren‚Äôt that special..\n\nUntil today! Soooo I‚Äôm 24 years old and I‚Äôm currently in school studying Small Business and Retail Management. I‚Äôts not really what I expected it to be but I‚Äôm glad that I took that step to get to know me and to see what my purpose is in life! I am currently in year 2 and I‚Äôm planning to do only 2 years (Associate Degree). But this morning I had a conversation with my sister‚Äôs friend and she is studying Nutrition and Dietics. I always regretted not taking a chance and try to do that also.. I think it‚Äôs been 4 or 5 years of me not taking that step because of my insecurities. I always thought that you had to have a degree in biochemistry but it turns out that thats not required at all.. I never actually researched it because I believed it was and I thought that I was not good enough. \n\nAfter our conversation this morning I felt a energy shift and I thought, if I still regret it today I‚Äôm going to still regret it in 10 years. So at school I asked my teacher to talk in private. We talked about how I maybe could combine the two, because my current study overlaps the other one. My current study started in febuary ‚Äò22 and I‚Äôll graduate in febuary ‚Äò24. And Nutrition and Dietics will start in september ‚Äò23. So it‚Äôs only about 6 months and my teacher told me that she thinks it most certainly was possible. She said that she would ask some colleagues for tips and she helped me a lot! \n\nSo I have had a lot of changes these past 2 weeks and I am feeling really energized after today! Not to mention that I always thought I was already to old to start a new study, and yet here I am just thinking why don‚Äôt I choose my own happiness and just doing what I think is best for me, not what everyone else thinks is best for me.\n\nI still have my dark moments and I really do miss my ex a lot. I talk to him daily again and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs a smart thing to do. I don‚Äôt want a boyfriend right now because I like how things ar enfolding right now for me. It‚Äôs something small but I know there are so many more bigger things just waiting for me. And it‚Äôs only myself who can reach those things, just me and my own willpower.\n\nI love you all! And thanks for checking in on me! I‚Äôll try to write daily but sometimes I forget or I don‚Äôt really feel like writing. But I‚Äôll try my best because this also is some sort of therapy for meüòå",

I don't need tips on what to study, but how. **How do I manage tasks, prioritize my time, delay gratification, and muster the energy to work when I am tired** (let's be honest, no one gives a c\\*\\*\\* at school if I am tired, that ain't an excuse to not put in the effort according to them)?\n\nDisclaimer: I need to get a medical check-up due to chronic fatigue. The issue might be hormonal, but I cannot afford a check-up and can't mess my life up just because I cannot get one. I deal with PTSD, chronic stress (esp financial), and executive disorders which either might be due to the comorbidity of depression and anxiety, or undiagnosed mild ADD. \n\nAt this point, idc if I have a disorder or I lose a limb or die trying to improve my life. I am just done with pitying myself and crying silent tears over myself. I'll take ANY help, including pointers to other resources to help maximize the use of my time, academics, mind, and body.",

And previously  I used to get a lot done on days when I got up early since there are less distractions and responsibilities towards others in the morning. But nowadays on days I do get up early I just end up spending hours in making breakfast and having it alongside watching youtube videos, some movies, listening to songs, etc. And I basically end up wasting the entire morning till it becomes noon. It's nice to have fun and some \"me time\" but I over do it, LOL. I do feel high energy and if I worked I'd probably get a lot of good work done in the morning but I just don't do it.   \nAny advice for how to become more disciplined and get work done in the mornings?",

If reasonable, anything I ever requested was granted ; I never had to walk in holed shoes or eat less than what I needed. Thankfully, I was also raised to not waste a lot, and am quite content with what I have, so I don't ask for a whole lot either.\n\nRecently, I decided to get a job so I could make some money, but as I said before, since I have what I need, I save most of it. I'm quite content with using the money for my expenses here and there, but I still have a crazy generous allowance to eat, and for the occasional night out (I'm not much of a party person so the impact is minor).\n\nRationally speaking, I'm very lucky to have what I have, but occasionally, I still find myself irritated or even mad that I have to spend my own money when I need things. For instance, up to today, every backpack I've used and wore down has been payed by my parents. Now that my latest one is becoming more and more fragile with every passing day, I'm looking for more solid backpacks but I'm not very content I have to pay my own. I also only own one pair of jeans that is on its deathbed and I assume I'm going to have to pay for the next pair.  \nThis makes sense of course, and I'm coming to terms with this, but I'd love to eliminate my attitude with that, because I'm truly grateful for what I have but these feelings I get make me feel the opposite.\n\nHow can I stop this dick-ish behavior? How do I accept that I eventually will have to pay my own stuff, and starting today is as good as ever?",

I used to struggle with depression a lot worse than I do now and found myself turning to unhealthy coping mechanisms like overeating and smoking. I knew they didn't make me any happier, but it made me feel less bad, and I was ashamed to admit that that was good enough for me at the time. This had been going on for a few years and really hit a peak during covid.\n\nI mentioned this to a friend who was into meditation and recommended that I try it out with him. At first, I was a little skeptical - I didn't know if I could sit still and \"focus\" for that long, and honestly it just didn't make any sense to me. But I started small and gradually practiced more with zoom sessions with a small group of friends.\n\nThe type of meditation I practice is called Vipassana. My friend who led our group sessions learned it at a retreat and I learned about this second-hand, so please correct me if I'm wrong! If you're not aware, it's a form of Buddhist meditation that's been around for 2,500 years and became more popular in the west in the 70s. The word \"vipassana\" means \"insight\" or \"seeing things as they really are.\" It's about training your mind to be present and aware in each moment, rather than getting lost in thought or distracted by external stimuli.\n\nI'm sometimes a little loose with the definitions, but to my understanding mindfulness meditation and Vipassana meditation are closely related, where Vipassana is actually a kind of mindfulness meditation that originated in India. It involves focusing your attention on your breath and bodily sensations in order to develop self-awareness and insight into the nature of reality. This is similar to the goal of mindfulness meditation, which is also about developing a clear and non-judgmental awareness of the present moment. I believe the main difference is that Vipassana is more structured and formal than mindfulness, but at least to me they accomplish the same thing at the end of the day, learning to not judge my emotions and actions and making it easier to let go.\n\nThe practice involves sitting in a quiet, comfortable place and focusing on your breath. As you inhale and exhale, you simply observe the sensations in your body without judgment. It's not about \"clearing your mind\" or trying to achieve any particular state - it's just about being present with what is. This was key for me, realizing that I don't have to just stew in my depressive thoughts, and instead I can notice they exist and not feel compelled to act on them by eating or smoking more. I know I'm oversimplifying the explanation a bit, and it's still a struggle even for me now, but I'm really proud of the progress I've made: I've quit smoking for over a year now, and I've been vegan for 3 months and feeling so much better about myself. Not having to hate myself for overeating/smoking cut through the cycle of self-sabotage. I still have my bad days, but not as low as they were before.\n\nSince I started practicing meditation regularly, I've noticed a huge improvement in my mental health. I'm more focused, less anxious, and I don't turn to food or smoking as much as I used to. It's not a quick fix by any means, but with patience and consistent practice, I've found that it's really made a difference in my life. I've mostly just read articles online and watched videos about it, so I'm looking for a way to expand my practice, like maybe taking a course or finding a meetup where I live (NYC if you have any recommendations!). I didn't mean for this to sound preachy about meditation. It might not be for everyone, but it was right for me when I didn't even really know what it was, and I'm hoping it'll get someone to consider giving it a shot.\n\nThanks for reading!",

Maybe other people have experienced the same thing. \n\nI always feel like I'm not good enough, which I know comes standard with the human experience. This has led me to quit a solid job (which was admittedly dead end and not paying enough to be viable in the long term) to go back to school for something more serious. I still grapple with this decision, but I don't entirely regret it. It feels like I quit the job out of fear of losing the job and not having any good backup plan. \n\nI am really directionless in my life, so I am constantly trying new things, never sticking with anything long enough to be really good at it. I am a chronic mind-changer. I always thought \"hey, worst case scenario, I'm physically fit, and can join the military\", so recently I got it in my head that I should quit this whole college thing to go off and join the navy, since that's where I'll probably end up anyway. Turns out there are many things I didn't consider, and I've decided against that path in the end. \n\nI feel like I want to chase self improvement, but I also might just be rationalizing self sabotage as self improvement. I'm having trouble distinguishing the two. Has anybody experienced anything similar?",

        "text": "Here are my tips for Personal Development:\n\n \n\n1. Set clear goals: Identify what you want to achieve in different areas of your life, such as career, relationships, health, and personal growth. Write down your goals and make sure they are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).\n2. Learn continuously: Read books, take courses, attend workshops, and seek feedback from others to improve your knowledge and skills. Embrace lifelong learning and stay curious about the world around you.\n3. Practice self-reflection: Regularly take time to reflect on your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Ask yourself questions like, \"What are my strengths and weaknesses?\", \"What can I do better?\", and \"What am I grateful for?\" Use journaling or meditation to help you gain insights and clarity.\n4. Take action: Turn your goals into action steps and take consistent, focused action towards them. Break down big tasks into smaller, manageable ones and celebrate your progress along the way.\n5. Embrace failure: Don't be afraid to make mistakes or fail. Instead, view them as opportunities to learn and grow. Use them as feedback to adjust your approach and try again.\n6. Take care of yourself: Prioritize self-care activities that nourish your mind, body, and soul. This can include exercise, healthy eating, getting enough sleep, spending time in nature, and doing things that bring you joy.\n\nRemember, personal development is a lifelong journey, and it takes time and effort to see progress. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself, and keep moving forward.\n\nWhat are yours? Feel free to share.",

If you‚Äôre a guy, chances are you‚Äôve probably been ghosted more times than you‚Äôve been successful going on a date with women from dating apps. This is partially because it‚Äôs a lot harder to make a good first impression if you‚Äôre an average looking guy since you‚Äôre competing with the Zac Enron‚Äôs of Tinder who disproportionately get most of the matches (There‚Äôs been a study done on this). \n\nAnyhow online dating as a result for an average has been a struggle and as a result I‚Äôve always wanted to do Cold Approach. My reasons aren‚Äôt to be a scumbag dude like most people like to associate with PUA-like activities. I want to do it because I fear it. It‚Äôs one of those things I never did and put off for years and it‚Äôs always affected my self perception or confidence in myself. I simply want to get over that fear and to get more confident in my abilities to simply talk yo a girl from zero and be able to have an organic conversation that may lead somewhere. \n\nI‚Äôve done warm approaches before but never cold approaches. I‚Äôm also not a bad looking dude, nor awkward, I‚Äôm a decent conversationalist and have been on a good amount of dates, but those are all from online dating through the years and never amounted to anything. To be frank, I‚Äôm just scared as balls to do cold approach which is why I need to do it. This shit literally is what wakes me up at night, knowing I‚Äôve never fully tried to push my potential to as far as I can go. \n\nI was wondering if there was a community or place I could go to find others like me who would like to practice coke approach together? \n\nI‚Äôm asking here because in the modern era no dudes are willing to cold approach, most of my guy friends won‚Äôt do it. I could try doing it alone but I feel working up to that would take a lot more mental gymnastics than simply setting up an accountability system with some other guys who‚Äôd be interested in helping one another progress.",

On top of that I eat like shit, literally eating nothing but junk food with absolutely no healthy alternatives such as fruits or vegetables, at all. Just chips, pizza, nuggets, soda, all that shit. It also doesn‚Äôt help that my parents are at Mexico at the moment, so all the stuff I eat that I listed is more prevalent than ever, since I can‚Äôt cook and my siblings don‚Äôt cook often so they just order out. I also participate in loser activities such as spending my free time in bed doing nothing, playing video games to put off work, and being addicted to p0rn. This is probably why I also have low self esteem and low confidence. It sucks because I feel like it‚Äôs so obvious to people that I‚Äôm a fucking loser, and because of that I‚Äôm often scared which makes me appear like a pussy which I am. Now, I‚Äôve tried making changes to my life in hopes of changing these things, such as exercising, having a good sleep schedule, and managing my time more wisely. Nonetheless I still eat like shit though because I simply don‚Äôt know what foods to eat. In the end, something in life always knocks me the fuck down and I go further down the hole. I‚Äôve recently been making small adjustments to my life by limiting junk food, sleeping well (well until now), and doing more slightly productive things such as cleaning after myself. This is just at home though, school is a completely different subject. School is where I‚Äôm really a loser. I have really bad mental health problems such as anxiety which makes me scared to go to school because of the shit that goes on there, I have really low confidence so often times I get really scared and intimidated by others especially those who seem more confident, which makes me look so weak, and there are things that happen with people or events that really sets me back in my journey to improving. For example today shortly before writing this, I had a paper due but I out it off to the side to play games with my friends. After hours of playing, we play a new game. As we‚Äôre playing I can hear my friends brother in the background. He‚Äôs a really intimidating guy and I was immediately scared. He tried talking to me and when I didn‚Äôt respond he immediately called me a pussy. He went off to talk more shit like about my name and why my friend hangs out w/ me. When he heard my voice he even said that every time he hears it he just wants to do something bad (I didn‚Äôt hear exactly what he said he would do because his mic cut out but I knew it was something bad). I got off shortly after and went to shower. Once I was showering I break down into tears. I knew what he said was true. I‚Äôm a fucking pussy who‚Äôs terrified all the damn time. I‚Äôm also a fucking loser. What happened today cause me to write this. It made me want to redownload reddit and ask for help, because I‚Äôm really hoping it does (it probably won‚Äôt depending if anyone sees this). What can I do to help make my life better? Is there anything I could do? Or will my life just suck forever like it always has? I know this is a lot but it‚Äôs just an attempt to get better.\n\nThanks.",

But one area in my life that‚Äôs not going well is my dating life, I‚Äôve been single for about 5 years and it‚Äôs recently been getting to me. Keep in mind I‚Äôve been with 7 women in my life, 3 were short term relationships and 4 were one night stands. I‚Äôm someone who was a late bloomer, a lot of that has to do with having Aspergers not to mention I was gawky growing up. Lately, I‚Äôve had this growing fear that I‚Äôm going to die alone and never have a wife and kids. My self-esteem has always been low my entire life and I blame it on my looks for having a very little success with women. I‚Äôve also been someone who has never fit-in and I‚Äôve always felt im not good enough for the women Im interested in since I‚Äôm not ‚Äúcool‚Äù. My friends and family say I‚Äôm good a good looking guy that can easily get women, but I have a hard time believing it as nothing they say is adding up. The interactions I get from women aren‚Äôt really positive either  I get all kinds of weird looks, or I get socially alienated because again I‚Äôm not ‚Äúcool‚Äù enough and I‚Äôve been referred to as ‚Äúweird‚Äù plenty of times. So I truly think I‚Äôm really ugly due to those circumstances. I know the problem is me and I realize that I need to be happy with my self first as I‚Äôve began my self-help journey at 29 when I started to take a look at myself. While I‚Äôve improved these past few years, I always catch myself relapsing into the victim-mindset of negative thinking and I‚Äôm tired of feeling like crap. I‚Äôve been dealing with this for years to the point where it‚Äôs literally apart of me and that‚Äôs all I know. I‚Äôve always felt ugly and have never felt truly confident with myself. Is there anybody out there who has been in my shoes that has advice? Also, is there any good self-help books for people in my situation?",

I have quite a lot of goals I want to do, (and as I'm a teenager) I have to study for the ACT, finish my Eagle Scout project, and write and memorize my ted talk in a month along with many actual self-improvement things I've really wanted to start. Things like watching more documentaries, reading a list of books, learning the guitar, getting jacked, and maintaining my good cardio for when cross-country season starts again. There's lots of things I want to do, and there's time. And I honestly feel like I could do all these things but I have one problem: Part of me thinks its a good idea to have fun times too.  \n\n\nJust today, I was doing a 37-minute plank (yes I'm also training for a 1-hour plank) and was watching a motivational video that convinced me in the moment to stop playing all video games, stop seeing my friends for a while, and focus on all the things that will make me a better person. \n\nBut then afterwards I realized, I love hanging out with my friends and playing videogames with them does bring me joy. It prevents me from getting my goals done too, but does bring in the moment happiness. And I know people say that you should live your teenage years having fun, so the question I'm asking is: **should I fully stop doing these fun things to make myself a better person?**  \nIm 16 if that changes anything",

        "text": "As long as I can remember myself I have alway been overweight, and I‚Äôve tried solving the issue multiple times.\n\nA few years ago me and my family moved from a third world country to the West (Canada specifically), and that‚Äôs when the weight really got out of hand. I went from 90kg to 120kg in a year, essentially putting myself under the obese category.\n\nAbout 8-10 months ago I decided to change, I went on a diet and started jogging every day. I went at it for a few months, got down to 115kg but then‚Ä¶ I stopped. I don‚Äôt have a valid excuse for why I did but it happened gradually. I started jogging less, telling myself that as long as I eat healthy I could get away with less exercise and then started throwing in some snacks here and there until I got back to 120kg.\n\nA few months after that, however, I had my best attempt so far. My parents got me a gym membership, and I went at it. For a whole 6 months I‚Äôve been on the ‚Äúgrind mindset:‚Äù I‚Äôve been working out every day of the week and had a very strict diet. By the end of those 6 months I went all the way down to 100 kg and started actually liking the man I saw in the mirror‚Ä¶ before it all went to waste.\n\nAfter the period I went on a trip, and since it was the first time I‚Äôve been outside of my city in 3 years I decided to have a good time and enjoy the local cuisine. I completely disregarded my discipline, ate everything I could see and, needless to say, I wasn‚Äôt working out. After returning from the trip I partially went back to my normal routine, but that didn‚Äôt last too long. The school year was starting soon and once it started I had barely any time to workout and my mind was too occupied to think about what I was eating. I went back to 120kg.\n\nNow, school wise and stress wise I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm doing pretty alright but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm satisfied with my body. At the age of 18, every time I squat my knees crack way too much than they should, my belly sticks out so much I hate to turn sideways in front of a mirror, and my jaw line is almost invisible. Ever since my 20kg achievement I haven‚Äôt been able to get ‚Äúback on track‚Äù and that‚Äôs really bothering me, I want to live a long and fulfilling life in a healthy body; any word of advice will be appreciated greatly.\n\nThank you kind stranger in advance",

        "text": " \n\nSo basically what the title says. About 2 months ago I had a girl tell me that she had feelings for me (keep in mind I had/kinda still have feelings for her too) but that she didn't want anything at all throughout uni, which was gonna be another 2 years. This really sucked especially since it was my first time having a girl tell me she felt something for me (I'm 21) but I understood where she was coming from and we agreed to keep being friends.\n\nAnyway cut to about a month later and I found her on dating app and I called her out on it a little. Without getting into it too much it really made me feel like she had lied to me, and she did want something and that I just wasn't good enough for her and it completely destroyed any and all of my self-confidence I had.\n\nSo how do I go about regaining my self-confidence? I've never really had any luck with women at all so this was a really major thing for me. I've tried dating apps in order to help move on, but I've gotten basically no likes or matches, and the only ones I have gotten legit stopped talking to me the second I told them my dog was in a different city.\n\nBut yeah I've never really had anything like this happen to me, and I've never had as low self-confidence as I currently have, anybody got any advice on how to regain it? Thanks so much in advance, and apologies if this isn't the right sub for this.",
