        "text": "Tamim Ansary's *Destiny Disrupted: A History of the World through Islamic Eyes* (2009) is a somewhat famous book. The man himself is a high school teacher whose goal was to present Islamic history to a popular audience in a way that would help people in the West understand how Muslims imagine their own history, and thus to make the Muslim worldview more understandable. An admirable goal, and in his introduction he emphasizes that the book is not about \"what really happened,\" but rather that his aim \"is mainly to convey what Muslims think happened, because that's what has motivated Muslims over the ages and what makes their role in world history intelligible.\" (xxi). The problem, of course, is that it is hardly plausible that many of the casual readers of this book (i.e. his intended audience) would bother to keep this fact in mind - that the author is not attempting a strictly factual history. I don't think Ansary sticks to his opening sentiment as closely as he should have, nor does he ever compare his presentation of \"what Muslims think happened\" with what academic historians think. Consequently much of the book ends up as badhistory, mainly for its anachronistic and teleological style.\n\nHowever, this post isn't about the book as a whole, but specifically about his discussion of the governmental organization of the Ottoman Empire in the 15th century, some of which is truly bizarre (pp. 178-82), and which cannot be ascribed to the author's above-mentioned goals. I'll just get right into it.\n\n&gt;Ottoman society as a whole was compartmentalized into the major religious communities, each with its own vertical and horizontal divisions, and each a semi-autonomous nation or millet, in charge of its own religious rites, education, justice, charities, and social services. The Jews, for example, were one millet [...] The Eastern Orthodox community was another millet [...] Then there was the Armenian millet [...] The leader of each millet represented his people at court and answered directly to the sultan. In a sense, the Muslims were just another of these millets.\n\nIn fact, the idea that the Ottoman millet system dated back to the 15th century was disproven in the 1980s. The millet system as we understand it did not come into existence until the 18th and 19th centuries, by which time the various religious communities had invented origin myths linking their establishment to the time of Mehmed II.^1 Ottoman religious minorities during the period under discussion were frequently granted autonomy on a local basis, but were not organized into empire-wide hierarchical communities with a singular leader and a cohesive organization. This misunderstanding comes from the fact that he relied upon the quite outdated work of Stanford Shaw (1976) instead of something more up-to-date, but this doesn't explain all of his later mistakes.\n\n&gt;The Sheikh al-Islam legislated according to the shari'a and presided over an army of muftis who interpreted the law, judges who applied the law [...] The shari'a, however, was not the only law in the land. There was also the sultan's code, a parallel legal system [...] This whole parallel legal system, including the lawyers, bureaucrats, and judges who shaped and applied it, was under the authority of the grand vizier, who headed up the palace bureaucracy (another whole world in itself).\n\nFor some reason Ansari depicts a strict legalistic and administrative divide within the Ottoman Empire, with religious law on one side and secular law (*Kânûn*, what he here calls \"the sultan's code\") on the other. This may go back to conceptions of Ottoman government first pioneered by Albert Lybyer in the early 20th century; he saw a strict division between the \"Men of the Sword\" and the \"Men of the Turban\" which affected all aspects of the Ottoman government, but this \"Lybyer Thesis\" hasn't been taken seriously for decades. The Sheikh al-Islam was the chief judicial figure in the empire and adjudicated based upon both Sharia and Kanun. There was no parallel legal system - they were quite integrated - it was simply the *legitimacy* of the law which came from two different sources, drawing either from the sacred texts or from the dynasty's authority. Ansari says that there were judges in both legal systems, but of course there was only one type of judge in the Ottoman Empire, and those judges applied both Sharia and Kanun. Also, the Grand Vizier was not the head of the bureaucracy. During this period, that would be the *Başdefterdâr*. The Grand Vizier was the head of the military-administrative branch of the government, and also served as the sultan's absolute deputy (*vekîl-i mutlak*), giving him de-jure power over the entire state.\n\n&gt;Another set of checks and balances built into Ottoman society involved the devshirme instituted by Bayazid. [...] Like the mamluks, the janissaries were trained to serve as the ruler's bodyguards-at first. But then the janissaries' function expanded. For one thing, they didn't all end up as soldiers anymore. Some were taught administrative skills. Others received cultural training. The sultan began appointing janissaries to top posts in his government as well as his armies and navies. He put janissaries in charge of important cultural institutions as well.\n\nAnsari doesn't understand the difference between being a janissary and simply being a devshirme recruit. Most devshirme recruits became janissaries, but others had the opportunity to enter the palace school established by Mehmed II to receive the above-mentioned training. This confusion of the term \"janissary\" wouldn't be a big mistake if it weren't for what he says next:\n\n&gt; Through the devshirme, the Ottomans crafted a brand new power elite for their society. Unlike the elite of other societies, however, the janissaries were forbidden to marry or have (legitimate) children. They could not, therefore, become a hereditary elite.\n\nJanissaries were indeed initially forbidden to marry. The recruits taken into the Ottoman palace school, on the other hand, were very much allowed to marry and have children, who could inherit their status. Thus the Ottomans did have a hereditary elite.\n\n&gt; Originally, the devshirme took boys only from Christian families in newly conquered territory. But Mehmet the Conqueror instituted another crucial innovation: he extended the devshirme into the empire itself. Henceforth, any family under Ottoman rule, Muslim or non-Muslim, high or low, might see some of its sons sucked into this special form of \"slavery,\" which was, paradoxically, a route to the highest strata of Ottoman society.\n\nThis is straight-up nonsense and I have no idea where it came from. The devshirme was never expanded to include Muslim families except under very special and limited circumstances, for instance in Bosnia, where local communities negotiated their mass-conversion to Islam in exchange for continued liability for devshirme recruitment. But that's definitely not what he has in mind here, so I'm at a loss for an explanation.\n\n&gt; Through the devshirme, the Ottomans crafted a brand new power elite for their society. [...] What power was left to the old nobility? Well, for one thing, they remained the biggest landowners in the empire and the major taxpayers. \"Landowner\" is a bit of a misnomer, however, because officially the sultan owned every scrap of soil in his empire. He only leased out parcels of it to favored people as \"tax farms\" (timars in Turkish}. A timar was a rural property from whose inhabitants the timar holder was allowed to collect taxes. Those inhabitants were, of course, mostly peasant cultivators living on the land. Tax farmers had permission to collect as much as they wanted from these people. In exchange for the privilege, they had to pay the government a fixed fee every year. Whatever they collected beyond that sum was theirs to keep; and there was no limit on how they were allowed to collect. The government's share did not depend on how much the tax farmer collected but on how much land was in the \"farmer's\" care. It was a tax on land, not a tax on income. If a property produced beyond all expectations, the tax farmer benefited, not the government. If a timar did poorly, the tax farmer took the hit. If he could not pay his tax for a number of years in a row, the timar was taken away from him and given to someone else.\n\nThe \"old nobility\" assimilated into the Ottoman ruling class (*askerî*), which means they weren't taxpayers at all. Ansari confuses timars with tax farms (*iltizâm*) which were a totally different institution. Somehow in his mind he's merged the two into a bizarre conglomerate. Neither tax farmers nor timar-holders were \"allowed to collect as much as they wanted\", that would be ridiculous. Unlimited taxation? Of course that wasn't how it worked. Neither tax farmers nor timariots paid the government a fixed fee every single year, though tax farmers typically bid on contracts lasting around three years on average, so I suppose that's where he got the idea from. The government's share of income from tax farms was dependent upon whatever the farming agent (*mültezim*) offered the government when bidding for the contract, not the size of the land under his care. Timariots, on the other hand, paid no taxes at all, their income went toward maintaining their military readiness and they had to serve in the imperial army in exchange for continued right to the revenue from the timar holding. The timar and iltizam systems were two different methods of handling land revenues, but Ansari has merged them into one.\n\n&gt;Don't try to follow this complexity: the complexity of the Ottoman system defies a quick description.\n\nBut it's fine! So long as his readers don't try to follow the complexity, he doesn't have to either!\n\n&gt;This glimpse into the Ottoman social clockwork does not begin to exhaust its fractal intricacy: look closer and deeper into Ottoman society and you'll see the same order of complexity at every level. Everything was connected to everything else and connected in many ways, which was fine when all the connections balanced out and all of the parts were working. Centuries later, when the empire entered its decrepitude, all the intertwining parts and intermeshing institutions became a peculiarly Ottoman liability; their intricacy meant that trouble in one place or sphere translated mysteriously to trouble in a dozen other places or spheres-but that came later. In the sixteenth century, the Ottoman Empire was an awesomely well-functioning machine.\n\nI'm not sure how to parse what he's trying to say here - having a complex society is bad? It's just a paragraph in which it appears that he's saying something profound when he's not really saying anything at all. And the empire never \"entered its decrepitude,\" for the fact that the empire didn't decline is something that an army of modern-day historians can attest to - and yes, could attest to back in the early 2000s when Ansary was writing his book. This, out of all his mistakes, is the only one which could have been explained away by it being \"what Muslims think happened.\"\n\nBaki Tezcan, *The Second Ottoman Empire: Political and Social Transformation in the Early Modern Period.* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010) p. 9.\n\n&gt; Ottomanist historians have produced several works in the last decades, revising the traditional understanding of this period from various angles, some of which were not even considered as topics of historical inquiry in the mid-twentieth century. Thanks to these works, the conventional narrative of Ottoman history – that in the late sixteenth century the Ottoman Empire entered a prolonged period of decline marked by steadily increasing military decay and institutional corruption – has been discarded.\n\n1.

        "author": "tropical_chancer",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5z64e0/women_were_better_off_in_prerevolutionary_iran/",
        "text": "It seems that every few weeks a picture is posted somewhere on Reddit of pre-Revolutionary Iran; usually of young women in miniskirts or pants with their heads uncovered, or of women with their heads uncovered protesting in the streets purportedly over the requirement of covering their heads in public. These pictures are usually met with comments of “Iran was better for women before the Revolution,” or how the Revolution and/or religion has “set women back.” This seems to be the general idea on religious revivalism: that it an absolute challenge to modernity and modernization. \n\nSo, I decided to look at various social indicators and statistics related to women and family life in Iran to see how the Revolution has affected women in Iran. \n\n**Women’s Education**\n\nEducation is perhaps one of the most striking changes. Before the Revolution, many girls (and boys for that matter) received no formal education. After the Revolution, primary school was made mandatory for both boys and girls. The Islamic government also heavily invested in education, especially education in rural and underserved areas of Iran to make education more accessible beyond the urban middle and upper classes. Illiteracy rates dropped dramatically for both men and women, and by the 00’s, women made up the majority of college students in Iran. \n\nPercentage of Girls Enrolled in Primary School:\n\n* 1970 - 52%\n* 2002 - 91%\n\nShare of Women with Higher Education Degrees 20 Years and Older:\n\n* 1976 - 1.0% (vs. 2.7% for men) \n* 2006 - 8.3% (vs. 11.3% for men) \n\nShare of Women with Theological and Higher Education Degrees (Including Students and Graduates):\n\n* 1976 - 2.6% (vs. 3.8% for men)\n* 2011 - 18.4% (vs. 18.2% for men)\n\nNumber of Women with Theological and Higher Education Degrees:\n\n* 1976 - 122,753\n* 2011 - 5,023,992\n\nShare of Women with Secondary Degrees:\n\n* 1976 - 2.9%\n* 2006 - 16.8%\n\nShare of Primary School Enrollment that is Female:\n\n* 1976 - 38.3%\n* 2006 - 48.3%\n\nShare of Technical School Enrollment that is Female:\n\n* 1976 - 19%\n* 2006 - 61%\n\nPercentage of Women in the Following Fields of Study at Universities (2006):\n\n* Medical Sciences - 73.08%\n* Humanities - 61.41%\n* Basic Sciences - 69.23%\n* Arts - 58.87%\n* Total (for all fields) - 52.40%\n\n**Women’s Literacy Rates**\n\n* 1976 - 35.8% (vs. 47.49% for men)\n* 2006 - 80.3% (vs. 84.61% for men)\n\nRural Female Literacy Rate:\n\n* 1976 - 19%\n* 2002 - 64%\n\nUrban Female Literacy Rate:\n\n* 1976 - 47.3%\n* 2002 - 81.7%\n\nFemale Youth (15-24) Literacy Rate 2008 - 2012:\n\n* 98.5%\n\n**Women’s Labor Force Participation**\n\n“Despite hindrances in some respects, Islamization along with other factors may have helped improve women's employment conditions in some other respects. Notably, the social and political environment after the Revolution was apparently consistent with the rapid extension of education beyond the modern middle and upper classes.”\n\nWomen’s Labor Force Participation:\n\n* 1976 - 14.8%\n* 2006 - 15.5%\n\nWhile this may not seem like a huge jump, it should be noted that the jobs women now do has evolved significantly since the revolution. Prior to the revolution, women’s labor was mostly through carpet making and handicrafts. Their nimble fingers were useful for the carpet weaving process. Which meant younger uneducated rural women did these jobs and were disproportionately employed. For example in 1976, 70% of employed women in Iran were illiterate. Now women’s labor is much more varied:\n\nPercentage of Working Women in Each Field:\nExecutive, Administrative, and Managerial Occupations:\n\n* 1976 - 0.11%\n* 2006 - 3.36%\n\nProfessional, Technical and Related Occupations:\n\n* 1976 - 15.5%\n* 2006 - 37.2%\n\nIndustrial Production and Transportation Workers and Simple Laborers (i.e. carpet weavers):\n\n* 1976 - 52.9%\n* 2006 - 36.9%\n\nDifference in Rural and Urban Women in Labor Force:\n\nUrban\n\n* 1976 - 11.3%\n* 2006 - 15.8%\n\nRural \n\n* 1976 - 17.6%\n* 2006 - 14.7%\n\n**Women’s Health, Family, and Home**\n\nTotal Fertility Rate:\n\n* 1976 - 6.24 births per woman \n* 2006 - 1.87 births per woman \n* 2012 - 1.92 births per woman\n\nMaternal Mortality Rate (per 100,000 live births):\n\n* 1975 - 274\n* 2008 - 30\n\nUnder 5 Mortality Rate (per 1,000 births):\n\n* 1970 - 226\n* 2012 - 18\n\nCrude Birth Rate (annual births per 1,000):\n\n* 1970 - 42.3\n* 2012 - 19\n \nAge at First Marriage:\n\n* 1976 - 19.7\n* 2011 - 23.4\n\nAge Difference Between Husband and Wife (In Years):\n\n* 1976 - 4.4\n* 2006 - 2.9\n\nPercentage of Women 15-19 Who are Married:\n\n* 1976 - 34%\n* 1986 - 32.5%\n\nAverage Household Size: \n\n* 1976 - 5.02\n* 2011 - 3.55\n\nPercentage of Households Having:\n\nPiped Water \n\n* 1976 - 40.9%\n* 2011 - 96.5%\n\nElectricity\n\n* 1976 - 48.3%\n* 2011 - 99.5%\n\nPercentage of Households Headed by Women:\n\n* 1976 - 7.3%\n* 2011 - 12.1%\n\n(1976 appears so frequently because it was the last national census before the Revolution)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAs this data shows us, pre-Revolution Iran was hardly a paradise for most Iranian women. In the late 1970’s, women in Iran still suffered from high rates of illiteracy, maternal death, infant mortality, limited education opportunities and attainment, limited job opportunities, and early marriage. **The average woman in pre-Revolutionary Iran had over 6 children.** Almost a quarter of children died before their fifth birthday. Only about half of girls were enrolled in primary school. 65% of women were illiterate, and less than 3% of women had college degrees. Virtually all of these indicators have improved, and in some cases dramatically since the Revolution. Most strikingly, the TFR decreased from 6.24 in 1976 to 1.92 in 2012. Between the early 90’s and the early 00’s, Iran experienced one of the strongest declines in fertility ever recorded. Iran’s TFR is now lower than that of the US, UK, and France. \n\nWhile the Pahlavi dynasty had made attempts at “modernization” in regards to women and the family, these were slow to make much of an impact on Iranian society. So in spite, or maybe because of the Islamic Revolution; women’s and family “modernization” has continued under the Islamic Republic and is better than it was in the 1970’s. \n\n“The assumption that the impact of rising support for political Islam has been categorically negative for women leaves many questions unanswered.”\n\n“All the evidence provided [...] is a challenge to the cultural reductionism that, unfortunately, is common in mainstream literature on women in the Muslim world.” \n\n*Sources*\n\n* https://www.amar.org.ir/Portals/1/Iran/census-2.pdf#32\n* http://faculty.las.illinois.edu/esfahani/IndexFiles/Nimble%20Fingers%20No%20Longer.pdf\n* http://www.mei.edu/content/educational-attainment-iran\n* https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/iran_statistics.html\n* Maternal Mortality in the Islamic Republic of Iran: On Track and in Transition by Miranda Sonntag Moazzeni\n* Myths and Realities of the Impact on Islam on Women by Roksana Bahramitash &amp; Shahla Kazemipour",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5z0ne9/the_authors_of_this_wikipedia_page_about_the/",
        "text": "[The page in question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornouaille)\n\nI'm going to focus on the opening paragraph, which reads as follows:\n\n&gt;Cornouaille (Breton: Kernev or Kerne) is a historic region of Brittany in northwest France. The name is cognate with the Cornwall region of Britain. This can be explained by settlement of Cornouaille by migrant princes from Cornwall creating an independent principality (during the Anglo-Saxon invasions in 430–1084 AD) founded by Rivelen Mor Marthou,[1][2] and the founding of the Bishopric of Cornouaille by ancient saints from the Cornwall region. The two regions spoke a similar Brythonic language which evolved into the Cornish language in Britain, and into a similar language, the Breton language across the English Channel in Brittany; both Breton and Cornish in turn are similar to Welsh.\n\nI've sort of come to expect this sort of shit every time I look at anything about Cornwall or Wales or Strathclyde or any other contentious part of \"Dark Age\" Celtic history, but this truly is some shitty history.  Let me begin!\n\n&gt;Cornouaille (Breton: Kernev or Kerne) is a historic region of Brittany in northwest France. The name is cognate with the Cornwall region of Britain.\n\nYeah cool, this bit's okay.\n\n&gt;This can be explained by settlement of Cornouaille by migrant princes from Cornwall creating an independent principality (during the Anglo-Saxon invasions in 430–1084 AD) founded by Rivelen Mor Marthou,[1][2] and the founding of the Bishopric of Cornouaille by ancient saints from the Cornwall region. \n\nREEEEEEEE\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the historiography of the British migration to Brittany, this is a reference to the \"Soldiers and Saints\" theory about why a bunch of Brittonic speakers ended up in Brittany.  To summarise the theory:\n\n1) Romans bring British soldiers into Northern France (how they do this is disputed - Aetius, Magnus Maximus and some chap called Riothamus are frequently referred to), forming the first wave of British migrations\n\n2) Some time later, a civilian migration led by \"saints\" comes down into Brittany, forming the second wave\n\nThe issue?  *There's no evidence for any of this shit.*  The \"saints\" bit, directly referred to in the article, is reliant on two bits of evidence: place names and hagiographies of Breton saints.  Brittany has a bunch of place names which feature the names of saints, and the suggestion is that these places were founded by the saints who then gave their name to the settlement.  Okay, nice theory, but unfortunately numerous place names mentioning a saint feature non-Breton saints such as my absolute fave Columba.  Is it likely these places were named after saints that founded them or more a reflection of the popularity of saints' cults?  \n\nAdditionally, Brittany has a rich tradition of hagiography, and frequently these saints are given a British princely origin, then come down to the continent to do some converting, talking to local leaders, and maybe some settling.  Unfortunately, it is very much apparent that these hagiographies are based on an earlier hagiography, that of St Samson, who does pretty much the same thing that the other Breton saints allegedly did.  Considering these hagiographies appear at a similar time in the  ninth centuries, they seem more of a reaction to Carolingian meddling in Breton church affairs than they do a genuine historical account or recollection about the life of the saint.  They are thus not a useful source for the British migration to Brittany.\n\nNow the Cornwall bit.  This probably pissed me off more than any reference to \"Soldiers and Saints\".  Here, the article implies that migrants came from Cornwall and pretty much immediately gave their name to the place they settled.  Sadly, this is full of fucking shit.  The first reference to a Cornwall in Britanny comes from the ninth century, while the migrants moved in the fifth and sixth centuries.  There is no evidence of territorial kingships, much less the establishment of an independent Breton principality of Cornwall, and in fact there's not much evidence for a hierarchical society in Brittany until much later.\n\nAnd maybe more fundamentally, we don't even know that these migrants came from Cornwall - more on this in a little bit.\n\nIn general, the issue with this event is that our sources are incredibly limited, with no source describing exactly who these migrants were, where they came from, who led these migrants etc., and thus the article claiming that things happened as they did is incredibly misleading.\n\n&gt;The two regions spoke a similar Brythonic language which evolved into the Cornish language in Britain, and into a similar language, the Breton language across the English Channel in Brittany; both Breton and Cornish in turn are similar to Welsh.\n\nYeah, okay, Breton and Cornish linguistically are more similar to each other than they are to Welsh, and all three languages form the \"Brythonic\" language group of Insular Celtic languages.  There seems to be the implication that Cornish and Welsh were already separate languages at this point in time.  This is not the case, and there is no evidence of Cornish being a distinct language from Welsh or Brittonic so early.  In fact, linguistically the major features that distinguish Cornish and Breton from Welsh came later, towards the eighth and ninth centuries, not the fifth and sixth centuries.  This would suggest that these migrants need not have come from Cornwall in the first place.\n\nIn the end, we don't know much about this period of Breton history, and as such such definitive statements are bound to be erroneous in some way or another, and as such fuck the authors of the article.\n\nSo, essentially:\n\n1. Soldiers and Saints is bullshit\n\n2. The designation of a Breton Cornwall probably came after the migrations\n\n3.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5ymp73/stockholm_syndrome_supposedly_for_women_was_the/",
        "text": "Hi, long time browser here, finally decided to submit some bad history myself from none other than [r/pureasoiaf](https://www.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/). I'm a big fan of asoiaf and the show game of thrones, but on multiple occasions, people like to look at the series and link back to history and analyze and make comments. No harm, huh? Unless you don't know what you are talking about.......[and think the majority of women in the past suffered from stockholm syndrome because of arranged marriages....](https://np.reddit.com/r/pureasoiaf/comments/5fs517/the_relationship_between_daenerys_and_drogo/dan1i42/)\n\nI'm going to be very picky so please bear with me here....\n\n&gt; I feel like this incredibly dismisses how miserable woman had it in the past, and today. As your trying to paint a 50-50 picture\n\nI suppose one could let this slide, but then again, how miserable women had it in the past? What time? period, and culture, does this refer to? Not all cultures in the past treated women miserably, and of those that were patriarchal, even they ranged in their treatment of women. Furthermore, this is also presentism, because it takes our modern notions of equality and puts it on a (massive generalization by poster) places of the past that did not share our cultural values.\n\n&gt; Just because this occurred, and yes, you're right about that, doesn't change the phyche of the woman going through it. I'm sure a TON of woman were not happy with their situation. \n\nSo arranged marriages occurred, that is one thing that is correct in this post. And I'm sorry the psyche of the woman going through it? Not only is there presentism, but somehow this person is qualified to judge the psyches of women in previous eras of history? \n\n&gt; I'm sure a TON of woman were not happy with their situation. And you make a lot of assumptions about them having sex, loving, and adapting. I mean, someone who's kidnapped will adapt.  \n\nAgain, problems aside of this massive generalization that does not deal with specific time periods or cultures, as if all women from history are just one big mass, how does this person know this? Where is the consideration that for instance in Medieval Europe, men and women, particularly from the upper classes were raised with the notion that marriage was not about love but it was a political transaction for the good of the family and alliances? Or perhaps the Mongolian Empire where arranged marriages were also the norm? And yes, there were arranged marriages in which there was unhappiness such as [Uracca of León and Alfonso I of Aragon and Navarre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urraca_of_León#Reign), and Philip the Handsome and Juana I of Castile, though this might be more the renaissance era for this couples. But there are other instances of unhappy marriages in this time period, and it would be remiss to ignore that, because it doesn't grasp the full picture. But kidnapped at will? What does this mean? The concept of arranged marriage as a whole? Or instances such as in Medieval Europe where women that were good political matches from powerful families, had to fear being kidnapped and married against their will? Such that even powerful women such as Eleanor of Aquitaine had such worries in the 12th century? Or back to the Mongolians, where on some occasions women were kidnapped, though this did not happen too often as it resulted in blood feuds? There is a clear difference between arranged marriage and bride-napping.\n\n&gt; Doesn't mean they would choose that, or would fall in love. It just means they would survive. And in my opinion, thats what a lot of woman in the past AND present are doing. Surviving.\n\nAgain, would really like to know what era, but I will just say it would depend, and in even in certain cultures it still would depend. A woman could most certainly choose to have an arranged marriage and fall in love. Katherine of Aragon for instance, was sent to England as a young girl of 15 by her parents the Catholic Monarchs, where she dutifully married her first husband, Arthur Tudor. And afterwards, guess what? She married his brother, Henry VIII of England, it was a political match and in her best interests and those of her families, but she chose to do and even loved the man, though undeserving of it he turned out to be. Her mother, Isabella I of Castile, chose Ferdinand II as her husband, a political match that again benefitted them both, but she eventually grew to love him. Her granddaughter, Mary I of England, married Philip II of Spain, a man she didn't know, and while he didn't love her, she still chose him and she even loved him. I think women can be given more credit here. And let's be fair here, women are only 50% of the arranged marriage, would we say that men were surviving by having arranged marriages? Plenty of men throughout history have had their marriages arranged by their mothers and fathers and married their brides and yes they fell in love with them. Is that them being kidnapped by their will? Is that them surviving?\n\n&gt; The fact that it doesn't happen anymore in areas where woman have became more equality, speaks volumes as to how many were in love, or formed love. They didn't want to be treated like that, and fought for equality. And to this day, still are.  \n\nIt says the women in our current modern culture who have been raised that marriage is for love and should be about equality, want those things. This says nothing about women in the past really, who depending on their culture and era, had different norms and expectations.\n\n&gt; I absolutly belive a lot of woman in the past and present suffered from what we consider pop-science \"Stockholm Syndrome.\"\n\nYeah, stockholm syndrome isn't even a mental illness, it's a psychological condition, and some even doubt it's real. Furthermore, this person is in no position to diagnose anyone in the past, considering their dead, and also the fact that they don't want to take cultural norms into account.\n\n&gt; Basically, just because we didn't have a word for cancer back in the day, doesn't mean cancer wasn't happening. Just because we didn't medically diagnose Stockholm Syndrome back in the day, doesn't mean it wasn't occurring. And it was probably the norm for woman, which is why it wasn't looked at as a \"issue.\" Even though we now know (some of us) how horrible they had it for so long.\n\nWe don't medically diagnose stockholm syndrome even today, it's a psychological condition! And furthermore we don't diagnose people of the past considering we can't sit them down and speak with them. While yes, people of the past had cancer and didn't know what it was, stockholm syndrome is not the same as cancer, and again how does one know that this was the norm for women? It wouldn't be seen as an issue because arranged marriages in specific cultures of the past were seen as the norm! They were expected, that doesn't mean that stockholm syndrome was the norm, and even then I should add that just because women entered into arranged marriages, doesn't mean they liked abuse (and of course what they considered abuse will vary depending on the era they live in and the culture) or didn't have issues with their husbands, which is another can of worms, but someone with stockholm syndrome would try and justify the abuse or see the basic lack of abuse as kindness.\n\nIn general, I am not trying to romanticize or justify arranged marriages, but in regards to history, they should be seen in their proper context, and stockholm syndrome isn't appropriate.\n\nI think I am done here, and I hope I did this correctly, but here are my sources:\n\n\n1. http://www.historyonthenet.com/mongol-society-women-men-and-children/\n2.

        "text": "So there I was trying to find a publication on municipal bureaucracy in Roman Egypt, when lo and behold I see a BBC article titled [Roman Empire: The Paradox of Power](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/romans/empire_01.shtml). \"*Oh, this has nothing to do with what I am looking up but what a pretentious title, too bad that BBC's strictness for historical accuracy is shit*\", but against my better judgement I click the link. \n\n&gt;A gap of 2,000 years may seem to have put the Romans at a safe distance from our own lives and experience, but modern Europe with its Union is unthinkable without the Roman Empire\n\nFirst it starts off talking about how modern perceptions of Roman Empire have changed and while that first sentence was warying,  it continues to cite several reasonable assumptions about what might make the Roman Empire less savoury to a modern audience, things like slavery, not allowing women full equality, all perfectly fine but then it says\n&gt;Centralised control, the suppression of local identities, the imposition of a unified system of beliefs and values - \n\nUm, no. While it can be argued that central control was a large part of holding the empire together and common cultural ideals and values were a part of the formation of Empire, the idea of complete Romanisation, of actively making a concerted effort to wipe away regional differences to create a culturally homogenous Empire of true Romans is unfounded and even it had been an integral part of official Roman policy (which it was not) then we would have to accept that it was largely unsuccessful, I mean how else do you explain the radical differences in culture and practice throughout the Empire? To use Egypt as an example the thoroughly un-Roman but all too Egyptian practices of mummification and sibling marriage seem to have enjoyed immense popularity in the Roman period and Egyptian deities were worshipped throughout the Empire even in Rome itself.\nAnd then it gets to the subject of the Emperors\n&gt;The figure of the emperor himself, as defined by Julius Caesar and Augustus, stands for good order in contrast to the chaos of pluralism - squabbling city-states or competing aristocrats.\n\nJulius Caesar was never an Emperor and this is getting ridiculous how often this mistake is made, \n\n&gt;The system that seems to us manifestly intolerable was in fact tolerated for centuries, provoking only isolated instances of rebellion in slave wars and no significant literature of protest. What made it tolerable to them? One key answer is that Roman slavery legally allowed freedom and the transfer of status to full citizen rights at the moment of manumission.\n\nCenturies? Really? Slavery is a lot older than that, the ancient world was not exactly innocent to the presence of slavery before Rome hit the scene. I personally have a bit of a crackpot theory that the reason no extant literature from discontent slaves exists is because it was mostly written and circulated by and for men in the aristocratic elite who would be both educated and influential not low-level slaves who would almost certainly be illiterate. But my main objection is with the assertion that the *possibility of freedom* is what made slavery palatable in the Roman Empire. Seriously how is that different from nearly every other form of slavery except the example they use which is Trans-Atlantic chattel slavery and why would slaves sent off to work in mines, on galleys or die in an arena go \"*Oh gee, you know I hate being a slave and the fact that I will probably die here but somewhere there is an educated and valued slave that might get his freedom from his aristocratic master and go on to start on a successful enterprise. That alone makes everything worth it...*\" And really, slavery was *definitely* well-known before Rome, basically everywhere Rome ended up some (generally similar) form of slavery was practiced and it is not even like ancient Greece and the Near East are not well known as slave-owning cultures so this is ridiculous.\n\nBut no, it gets worse from here\n\n&gt;But while this offends against the core values on which the modern world is based, brutality and human rights abuses are not limited to the past. Enough to think of the stream of refugees struggling to break into the fortunate zones of Europe, and recall that the Roman empire collapsed in the West because of the relatively deprived struggling to get in, not out.\n\n[*sighs*] Another victory for the \"Immigration caused the fall of the Roman Empire\". I mean, even BBC is on this now, I do not even want to bother pointing out everything retarded in this, I just want to go lie down and consider what the world is coming to.\n\n&gt;But it was above all a Mediterranean empire, and pulled together diverse cultures, in Asia (the Near East), Egypt and North Africa that have not been reunited since the spread of Islam.\n\nO_O Um... there are two ways I can interpret this, one is more likely the intended meaning but is deeply rooted in the writer's own agenda, the other is simply stupid. \n\nOption 1 is that this is implying that coming of Islam divided these regions and ruined all the progress of Rome, except that ~~Rome falling had nothing to do with Islam~~ Edit: Islamic caliphates and kingdoms *did* have a lot to do with the fall of the *Eastern* Roman Empire so my brain screwed up there, what I *should* have said is that there were other contributing factors (no not thermodynamics, immigration or Christianity) and that a lot of the North African provinces had not been in peaceful bliss, they were ceded to the Vandal Kingdom prior to their reconquest and the Moors outside of their borders (who were not Islamic at the time I am referring to) also made administration in the region difficult. The territories that were picked out for this example are also somewhat strange, not only were most of these regions unified under the Ottoman Empire (North Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean and Egypt) and to a lesser extent under various caliphates but with the flawed premise that Islam was a unified political entity it would seem that they were plenty unified under Islam and indeed most of the Middle East and North Africa is still majority Islamic. But of course this is about as reasonable as talking about the unification of Europe under Christianity, which would be ridiculous. \n\nOption 2 is that this is implying that Islam reunited these regions which would later experience a decline and fragmentation but this is also a weird statement because arguably Islam is no more a unified and cohesive group than other religions but no one ever treats Christianity like a singular force and in any case much of Asia Minor and North Africa is still Islamic but not unified. And again, I do not have the feeing this was the intended interpretation.\n\n&gt;This represented a vast diversity, including language (two 'international' languages were still needed for communication, Greek as well as Latin, let alone local languages) and relative development - they spoke of 'barbarians' versus Romans/Greeks, where we would speak of first and third world. The planting of cities, with their familiar apparatus of public services and entertainment, was a sign and instrument of the advance to 'first-world' status.\n\nYep, nothing more black-and-white than ancient constructions of identity around definitions of \"Greek\", \"barbarian\" and \"Roman\", especially in a Near Eastern context and of course the modern dichotomy and terminology of the developing/developed world is applicable the ancient Mediterranean. Obviously, the socio-political landscape and conceptualization of development and ethnicity has not changed since then except that \"*Rome/Greece*\" = *The EU* and \"*barbarians*\" = *Teh Refugees*. I mean, Parthia and all the non-Hellenistic kingdoms were basically just modern Niger except with more eyeliner and jewellery, Gaul is like Afghanistan but with fur capes and leather armour and Britain is naturally a slightly more pagan Haiti. No one outside of Greece and Rome knew anything of these \"cities\", \"public services\" or  \"entertainment\", at that time they were all stuck in tribal disputes over pastures and trying to invent civilization until the Romans showed them how. All Romans and Greeks of course, lead lives analogous to the modern first world in terms of income, education and health in their marble villas which housed their happy literate families with low, low infant mortality rates.\n\n And we all know that outside of Southern Europe was a vast wasteland of barbarism...that was also at times characterized by Roman authors as being decadent and over civilized, but in any case Roman perceptions of \"barbarians\" were totally consistent and universal when it came to the negative aspects of non-Romans in their many different contexts from Britain to Bactria amirite?\n\nAll in all, this article is not the most terrible thing I have read but it is pretty bad and tries way too hard to make a social commentary on contemporary issues by projecting onto the past while at the same time congratulating itself on how far we have come since then. Hopefully you guys enjoy hating it as much as I did.\n\nEdit:\n\nNo I do not hate Andrew Wallace Hadrill and I will just go ahead and openly admit to being a pedant here. I also am not trying to push any pro-Islamic agenda, defend atrocities/conquest (obviously) or make statements against current political figures (how would anyone glean that from this post?) so do not PM me asking about it, if you have to, just put that s**t in the comments and I will answer it there. Basically, I did not expect this much controversy around this post and while I am fine with arguing the finer points of whether Caesar = Emperor or first world = literally Rome, I draw the line at getting private messages. I do not want to whine or anything but I also do not want anyone to get the wrong idea and think I have an agenda, seriously I can not even plan my day, I definitely have no political agenda.",

Yes, Poles laid dibs on the Sarmatians first, but it's not like they care. \n\nNow, after at least seven years of vegetation, it's devolved into this weird pseudo-news network, and to not offend Rule 2 too much, basically, they jerk off to neo-paganism, constantly bitch about the government, spout a lot of nationalist and anti-refugee nonsense and hate the organization with the 12 stars and blue background with a passion, to not delve too close to modern politics. I think you can easily tell where they're heading when they call the \"general\" section \"Genocide\"\n\nBut I'm here not to talk about their current state, I instead whipped up an interesting article of theirs from their golden age, in 2010.\n\n[\"About Greater Lithuania, it's cities and districts and the will of the Nation\"](http://www.sarmatas.lt/05/apie-didziaja-lietuva-jos-rajonus-miestus-bei-tautos-valia)\n\n&gt;LITHUANIA according to until now hidden, destroyed and nevertheless found sources in the world history archives has existed for 3850 years. These historical facts are proven and were found in Spanish archives by our enlightened mind, Jūratė Statkutė de Rosales. She declared that in the \"Jordanes Chronicle\" and in other authentic primary sources we are the successors of one of the biggest and and earliest kingdoms in the history of Europe.\n\nFor the uninitiated, Jūratė Statkutė de Rosales is like the second person next to the already discussed Česlovas Gedgaudas in this Lithuanian supremacist agenda. She has written similar books discussing similar ideas, and scholarly opinion of her is the same - she crazy.\n\nSadly, Lithuania hasn't existed for 3850 years, and it'd take some serious damn evidence that we did.\n\n&gt;Surviving maps prove that Lithuania was one of the biggest countries in Europe, and since the 14th century - the biggest.\n\nMedieval Lithuania was like a balloon. It looked big, but it was empty on the inside.\n\nA country with a million square kilometers may look big, but when it only had 3 million inhabitants, it may as well be the size of Poland.\n\n&gt;And the Kingdom of Poland was 10 times smaller by size than the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, taking up only the lands of Krakow, Sandomierz, Poznan, Gniezno, Kalisz, and a few other tiny lands.\n\nSpeak of the devil.\n\nFirst of all, they missed the entirely of Mazovia and most of Galicia, both wealthy and important regions in Poland at the time.\n\nSecond of all, this is a Mongolia vs Korea scenario. Is Mongolia much bigger than the Koreas? Yeah. But is it more populous or stronger? Well, I wouldn't bet in it. Lithuania had shit for population. Poland was stronger, it was a more economically developed and a more populous nation. Or at least had more or less the same population. [See here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Lithuania#Demographics) Move on.\n\n&gt;So any Polonized local inhabitants, the \"tutejszy\", talking a half Belarusian language, explaining that \"this is our land\", need to see some maps. The so-called \"Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth\" was divided and robbed by aggressors three times. From 1795 these lands were occupied by Russia. So how could Polish citizens come here if Poland was never here?\n\nWell, you just explained how - they were Polonized. Which, by the way, does not make them any less inhabitants of the Vilnius Region than Lithuanians or Poles. And I don't even know why we're talking about this *when the tutejszy were an early 20th century phenomenon and have been assimilated AND DON'T EXIST ANYMORE, GOD, WHICH CENTURY DO YOU LIVE IN?*\n\n&gt;This is why the history of the GDL has been falsified, our prehistory has been hidden, in Lithuanian schools Lithuanian history only takes up a few lessons in the day, history textbooks are written by people who don't love Lithuania. (Followed by two paragraphs of ranting about the History Institute and how it has sold Lithuania to the Poles and has been ignoring the obvious clues to the 4000 years of true Lithuanian history, which are supposedly so obvious that only a few fringe historians can find them, yo)\n\nWe Lithuanians are great at hating ourselves. We hate ourselves as much as we hate Poles.\n\n&gt;Česlovas Gedgaudas in his book \"Searching for Our Past\" writes:\n\nOh, yeah, these people also worship Gedgaudas because why the hell not.\n\n&gt;The lands occupied in World War One or in any other war and thus their forcefully changed country borders cannot be accepted as historical, because they're not.\n\nBut...\n\nWhat.\n\nBut WWI or any other war *are* history. And since those borders are in history, they must be historical...\n\nBut no. Because they're not. Right, should we give Lithuania back to the Russians, then? After all, the illegitimate and ahistorical German occupation led to the illegitimate and ahistorical restoration of Lithuania, right?\n\n&gt;The ethnic Lithuanian lands were at the Baltic Sea and will be here forever. This is proven by the survival of one of the oldest languages in the world - Lithuanian.\n\nThe Lithuanian language is far from the oldest in the world or even in Europe. The Lithuanian ethnicity, and thus presumably their language, former around 5th century AD, and there already were a number of languages formed across the world. In addition, that Lithuanian was faar from the one we use - in fact, most of the grammar and vocabulary of modern Lithuanian was constructed pretty much from the ground up (hell, my current school was named after the linguist who was heading this effort) in the 20th century, and if we were to only count modern Lithuanian, then we would in fact be using one of the world's newest languages.\n\nSure, Lithuanian is a conservative language, thanks to our beloved linguists purging everything we took from nearby languages in cold blood, but it's not all that old.\n\nIn addition, Lithuanians having access to the Baltic Sea is also a recent phenomenon. I'm sure you know that not all Balts are Lithuanians, and the Lithuanians used to only take up that is now eastern Lithuania, far from sea access. Even when the Grand Duchy managed to push to the sea, the shores of the Baltic were inhabited by Curonians and later a distinct Samogitian ethnosus until much later, when they were assimilated into the Lithuanians.\n\nThis is as far as I go, because everything past this line either deals with stuff that has already been said, modern politics (the Polish Electoral Action of Lithuania) or neo-paganism.\n\nSources: Wikipedia for basic fact-checking.

        "text": "At some point late last year I encountered what might be the Da Vinci Code/Ancient Aliens of magazines: [Australia's World of Knowledge and \"The Royal Family's Secret Nazi Past\"](https://www.magzter.com/AU/Bauer_Media/World_of_Knowledge_Magazine_Australia/Education/176725)\n\nThis beauty strolled back into my life this morning, breaking down the case against the Windsors - or to give them their real name, *DER WINDSORS* - by 'evidence'. I have a feeling I'm going to do each one, but counter-intuitively I started five parts in because the premise is very odd.\n\n&gt;EVIDENCE 5: Windsor Family Tree\n&gt;How German is the Queen and her family?\n\nNot sure how this constitutes as “evidence” isn’t German heritage = Nazi links sort of, you know, racist?\n\nAnyway, let’s look at some of the claims:\n\n&gt;The gig was given to a foreigner - George Ludwig, Prince Elector of Hanover: a German through and through\n\nI don’t know about “German through and through”, George I’s grandmother, Elizabeth Stuart was born in Scotland, which is what placed him in the succession and bumped him to the head of the deck once Roman Catholics were omitted.\n\nSo, yeah, George is pretty German but “through and through” suggests *totally* and *irredeemably* German, not three-quarters German.\n\n&gt;The new German throne-sitters had a good run, lasting until 1837 when Queen Victoria took over the top job.\n\nDynastically, yes, this was the end of the Hanovarians but I don’t know how the point can be made, in real terms, that Victoria represented a break from the “new German throne-sitters.” \n\nShe was a) a grandchild of George III, one of the previous “German throne-sitters” b) her mum was German-born, and c) German was the language of her childhood and family life. But then George III, George IV and William IV were all born in Britain, George III made great pains to identify with the nation of his birth, telling parliament in his accession speech that he was “Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of Britain” and the future George IV described himself and his brother, the future William IV as “completely English.”\n\nThere’s a point when you have to let it go, guys. They're as English as a sunday roast at a garden centre.\n\n&gt;The new monarch followed a strong tradition of English royalty marrying German royalty\n\nThat’s true, but them being German wasn’t nearly as important as them *being Protestant*, which more often than not also meant German. \n\n&gt;It’s not clear whether the average pre-20th-century Brit knew, or even gave a hoot, that their royals had so much German blood flowing through their veins\n\nYes it is clear they knew. The perceived Germanness of the Hanoverians was something that they constantly strove to overcome, George I was very obviously German, with a German court and German manners, and George II had his own presentation problems despite his best efforts. George III made a huge song and dance of being born in Britain, but the press still tutted about his patronage of German music and art, and there were constant worries – especially in parliament – of the monarch using the British crown to advance Hanover’s cause. (Parliament largely won out and Hanover was increasingly left to its own devices)\n\nBeyond the Hanovarians it was scarcely a secret. So fatigued by her predecessors and the myriad German princelings living off the public purse were the British public that there was enormous hostility to Prince Albert. Victoria herself was seen as having pro-German sympathies and as Prussia’s star rose in Central Europe this was viewed increasingly suspiciously. In May 1864 the peer Lord Ellenborough complained “in all public questions relating to Germany, Her Majesty’s ministers have much difficulty in carrying out a *purely English policy*.” (my emphasis)\n\nThen as we creep toward the end of the century, we have her grandson Kaiser Wilhelm II popping over for state visits and making much of his family connection – he marched in the first rank of Victoria’s funeral procession in 1901 and held ranks in British regiments and gleefully worn British uniforms (his British cousins did likewise), while the extended family shared British and German titles amongst themselves.\n\nBut unlike the first two thirds of the century, for much of the late 19th Century and the early 20th the German connection was celebrated. Germany was seen as a bastion of industry, science, culture and sophistication, German restaurants were even enormously fashionable *but then*\n\n&gt;come 1914 things had changed. The English and German royals found themselves on opposing sides in World War One, and suddenly having the family surname Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was not a good look for the palace.\n\nDoesn’t that disprove the previous point then? Yes, come war the perceived closeness between the dynasties was viewed as problematic, which means people knew they had German heritage so omigodshutup.\n\n&gt;George V’s wife Mary was the first royal consort in 400 years to speak British as a mother tongue.\n\nWhat is this language, *British*? Was she the last Brythonic shield maiden or something?\n\nThere’s some mean-spirited sleight of hand here too, because the author is implying that for the last 400 years the consorts were Germans. \n\nEdward VII’s consort Alexandra of Denmark was, unsurprisingly, Danish. She hated Germany btw, because of the humiliating Second Schleswig War that saw a chunk of Denmark carved off in the name of German Unification, but stuff like that undermines the idea that there’s some sort of terrible Nazi Cthulhu sleeping beneath Buckingham Palace waiting to awake.\n\n**Sources:** *Imperial Requiem* by Justin C Vovk, *Queen Victoria: A Biographical Companion* by Helen Rappaport, *The Hanoverian Dimension in British History, 1714–1837* by Brendan Simms and Torsten Riotte and my trusty never-leave-home-without-it copy of *The Hanovarians* by The Hanoverians: The History of a Dynasty by Jeremy Black.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5yf419/a_list_of_american_atrocities_leaves/",
        "text": "Greetings, Badhistoriers! So I was browsing r/socialism for laughs and they had a link to the following:\n\nhttps://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md\n\nIt is a list of 'atrocities' committed by the US. Whilst I am certainly not taking the position that the US is a country without sin (it, like every other state, pursues a foreign policy that promotes it's interests first and foremost), some of these are absolutely ludicrous in terms of historical accuracy. One of these in particular really annoyed me:\n\n&gt;The US intervened in the1950-53 Korean Civil War, on the side of the south Koreans, in a proxy war between the US and china for supremacy in East Asia. South Korea reported some 373,599 civilian and 137,899 military deaths, the US with 34,000 killed, and China with 114,000 killed. The Joint Chiefs of staff issued orders for the retaliatory bombing of the People's republic of China, should south Korea be attacked. Deadly clashes have continued up to the present day.\n\nNow, I lived and worked in South Korea for 5 years, so I might be a biased in addressing this, but the person who wrote this has a BRAIN UNFETTERED BY RATIONALITY, INTELLIGENCE AND LOGIC.\n\nFirst of all, it states that the US \"intervened\" on the side of the South Korea. This gives the impression that the US got involved in an internal conflict for the lolz. To begin with, a UN Security Council resolution from the 25th of June:\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/82(1950)\n\nStates that the Republic of South Korea was seen as the lawful representative of the Korean people since the 21st of October, 1949, and that North Korea was the aggressor as their military actions were seen as a \"Breach of the Peace\". Additionally, it also called on North Korea to withdraw to the 38th Parallel, and that member nations should aid in the process. Furthermore, the UN Security Resolution of the 27th of June makes it clear this should involve military assistance. Another UN Security Council Resolution from the 7th of July:\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/84(1950)\n\nExplicitly authorizes the unified command to utilize the UN flag in military operations, and formally requests that the US oversee military operations.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nRather than an \"atrocity\", the US was *acting in accordance with the will of a recognized international agency, and within the bounds of international law*. In what universe does the US actually fulfilling UN obligations and obeying resolutions constitute a bad thing? \n\nEdit: As there has been some counter-arguments, I will add some extra stuff I mentioned in this thread:\n\nThe UN had many states as members that were under Soviet domination, including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, and Belarus. All these nations were part of the assembly, which recognized South Korea as a country, meaning the US can hardly be said to have gotten a \"rubber stamp\" for that. Additionally, the UN Security Council put forth resolutions that criticized Western colonialism. For example, In January 1949, the Security Council issued the following regarding the Dutch in Indonesia:\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/67(1949)\n\nIt makes clear that the continued Dutch occupation of Indonesia is unacceptable and should end. The Dutch were founding members of NATO, and close allies of the US:\n\nhttp://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52044.htm\n\nSo there was clearly a variety of interests at play at the UN, rather than just the US being dominant. Additionally, since The Republic of Korea was recognized by the UN *General Assembly* as the lawful representative of the Korean People, a war to protect the independence of a legitimate state can be defined as a \"just war\" according the principles of the UN. Keep in mind that the UN charter was not designed as a means to enforce US dominance. The USSR had a key role in it's formulation:\n\nhttp://www.un.org/en/aboutun/charter/history/dumbarton.shtml\n\nSo the principles of the Charter were also in line with the ethics of a Socialist country opposed to Western imperialism. In this context, Article 51 of Chapter 7 states:\n\n\"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\"\n\nSource: http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5y8wsh/crash_course_world_history_on_dark_ages/",
        "text": "I couldn't find this topic on here, even though the video on Dark Ages is kind of insulting in how much it simplifies the Medieval Period. Crash Course's video on the Dark Ages is a case of Badhistory because of over-simplifications or generalisations about the Middle Ages in Europe and wrong use of the term Dark Ages. It follows the ideas made during the Renaissance and dismisses European Medieval history as trivial compared to the rest of the world focused on in the video.\n\nVideo in question: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV7CanyzhZg\n\n&gt; The period between 600 and 1450 CE is often called the Middle Ages in Europe because it came between the Roman Empire - assuming you forget the Byzantines - and the beginning of the Modern Age. And it's sometimes called the Dark Ages because it was purportedly so unenlightened...\n&gt; If you like cities and great poetry then the Dark Ages were indeed pretty dark in Europe...\n&gt; Medieval Europe had less trade, fewer cities, and less cultural output than the original Roman Empire.\n&gt; Instead of centralised governments, Europe in the Middle Ages had Feudalism - a political system based on reciprocal relationship between lords, who owned lots of land, and vassals, who protected the land and got to dress up as knights in exchange to pledging loyalty.\n\nFirst I would like to say that I take issue with the idea that the entirety of Medieval Period should be \"Dark Ages.\" The name Dark Ages was coined in Victorian Era because we didn't have many sources on the Medieval period, but it's incorrect to be saying that about around 11th century onwards, so the start of High Medieval era on to the start of Renaissance in 15th century. We know quite a lot about that time period. In fact in many ways we know more about it than about antiquity.\nThough the term itself is pretty bad, applying it to the entire Medieval Era is even worse. I believe the term should be applied only to Early Medieval period (Fall of Rome to around 11th century. Battle of Hastings is often cited as the start of High Medieval. Then Late Medieval is 14th to 15th centuries). He also makes a claim that the Dark Ages are called that because they were 'unenlightened' but that's again entirely false.\n\nNow, the TRUE Dark Ages, as in Early Medieval period, were transitional. Rome just fell and tribes all around Europe tried to carve up their piece of land. There was a massive void in power and many small nations trying to fill it. This, coupled with indeed many 'lost' technologies did mean that written language or stone buildings wouldn't be that common for a while. However by 11th century I'd argue that Europe mostly recovered. We quickly caught up with architecture, building grand Cathedrals and castles out of stone (both a thing in 11th, but really kicking off in 12th and 13th centuries). Our understanding of hygiene would take a long while to recover, sure, but that in itself wasn't really such a huge issue. Crash Course implies that everyone was suddenly thick, especially when compared to the rest of the world, but that's simply untrue.\n\nFurther problem with the video is that CC blankets the ENTIRE Medieval period with Feudalism. Feudalism was on the way out in 14th century, and by 15th most nations moved the means of production from landowners to cities, which paved the way for the disappearance of heavy cavalry and knights on the battlefield come 16th century. It's also arguable how much of Europe was feudal in Early Medieval era. I should also add here that you'd be amazed how far technology had come by 15th century. I'm interested in blacksmiths so I know for instance about water-powered hammers and blast furnaces which would be used through 15th century.\n\nHe does mention cultural advancements that religion would bring about, but appears to be rather dismissive of them. Medieval period wasn't a \"Dark Age\" by any measure. I think it'd be nitpicking to say the great cultural and technological milestones that Medieval Era brought about, but please, Europe went from fighting between tribes all the way to the printing press and mechanised workshops.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/event/Dark-Ages\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages\nI don't agree with everything these links say either, but a lot of it is damnsight better than the drivel that Crash Course is saying about Medieval Europe. As for the rest of the world I really can't comment, as I'm not that interested in it.",

        "text": "Greetings Badhistoriers. R/badhistory has a reputation as being a wretched hive of social justice warriors, militant feminists and Joss Whedon fans. As a reactionary neocon corporate shill, I am offended by this accusation as this place is also a haven for capitalist oppressors, so I have decided to tackle some badhistory found in this thread:\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mzpyk/debt_slavery_why_it_destroyed_rome_and_why_it/?ref=search_posts\n\n&gt;This is a fantastic article. It doesn't address the question, though, of how to break the cycle of civilization from tyranny, democracy, oligarchy, tyranny, etc... \n\nAh, the old 'cycle of civilisation'. Besides Atlantis, this was Plato's great legacy in terms of inaccuracy. In his Republic, Book 8, he writes:\n\n\"That question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments of which I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government which teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and worst disorder of a State. \"\n\nThe problem with this claim is that it tries to fit a ming-boggingly large array of cultures into one, neat model. It is also very euro-centric as it assumes *all* civilizations will follow such a pattern. Lastly, there are plenty of long lived states which defied this pattern. For example, the Byzantine Empire remained an imperial monarchy for the entirety of its history, even though the nature of that monarchy varied. The basis of the Komnenid dynasty was a network of wealthy, land-holding families who intermarried with one another, but before this, especially during the Macedonian dynasty, the foundation of power was derived from having control of the bureaucratic apparatus based in the capital and the central *tagmata* armies. The Achaemenid Empire likewise began and ended as a monarchial state with the *Shah-an-Shah* maintaining their position through palatial administration and the distribution of wealth, land, favor and other rewards. The Tang Dynasty blended aristocracy with autocracy, but saw the emergence of a bureaucratic mode of governance based on degree-holders, which had a full culmination in the Song Dynasty, something Plato never even thought of. \n\n&gt;Rome never fell. Christianity became the state religion, and then it became the Vatican - governorship was replaced with \"divine election\" with the possibility of papal excommunication. all that time, people were fighting over what was \"Christian\" and what wasn't. \n\nBwahahahahahaha! The Vatican took a hell of a lot of time to evolve into it's current form. The Papal States did not come into being until the 8th century AD with the Donation of Pippin, and to which governorships is the poster referring? Provincial? City? Monarchial? During the 6th century AD, the Emperors at Constantinople held the power to appoint governors, not the Popes. \n\n&gt;That and about 8 million other things. External wars did them no good. They had no real understanding of economics, so they couldn't successfully manage their currency \n\nGaaaaaaaah! The Romans were not \"economically illiterate\". Quite they opposite. They had an excellent understanding of economics based on the *nature* of their economic system. They understood debt, interest rates, profit, the nature of supply and demand as well as balanced expenditure. Tacitus wrote:\n\n\"In the meanwhile, the whole band of accusers broke loose upon those who augmented their wealth by usury, in contradiction to a law of Caesar the Dictator, \"for ascertaining the terms of lending money, and holding mortgages in Italy;\" a law waxed long since obsolete, through the selfish passions of men, sacrificing public good to private gain. Usury was, in truth, an inveterate evil in Rome, and the eternal cause of civil discord and seditions, and therefore restrained even in ancient times, while the public manners were not yet greatly corrupted. For, first it was ordained by a law of the twelve tables, \"that no man should take higher interest than twelve in the hundred;\" when, before, it was exacted at the pleasure of the rich\".\n\nAnd \n\n\"Hence a great scarcity of money: for, besides that all debts were at once called in; so many delinquents were condemned, that by the sale of their effects, the current coin was swallowed up in the public treasury, or in that of the Emperor. Against this stagnation, the Senate had provided, \"that two-thirds of the debts should by every creditor be laid out upon lands in Italy.\" But the creditors warned in the whole; nor could the debtors without breach of faith divide the payment. So that at first, meetings and entreaties were tried; and at last it was contested before the Praetor. And the project applied as a remedy; namely, that the debtor should sell, and the creditor buy, had a contrary operation: for the usurers hoarded up all their treasure for purchasing of lands, and the plenty of estates to be sold, miserably sinking the price; the more men were indebted, the more difficult they found it to sell.\"\n\nI've tutored economics at a high-school level, this is basic stuff I would find in any text-book. There was no ignorance at all.\n\n&gt;The emperors funnelled money to the military to keep them on their side (it didn't always work).  \n\nThis is actually a sensible policy as the authority of the Roman Emperors depended on the degree to which they had control of the military, and controlling the military allowed them to secure the integrity of the Roman state by asserting central power and repelling invasions, so this contributed to the *survival* of Rome, not it's fall. \n\n&gt;Overextension led to overtaxation and mighty corruption (particularly among the tax collectors) which led to debt. \n\nIf the poster is assuming that corruption led to the fall of Rome, then how is it explained that the Roman Republic actually achieved super-power status when corruption was endemic? One example is that of Gaius Verres, who was prosecuted by Cicero. In *Against Verres*, Cicero states:\n\n\"In truth, what genius is there so powerful, what faculty of speaking, what eloquence so mighty, as to be in any particular able to defend the life of that man, convicted as it is of so many vices and crimes, and long since condemned by the inclinations and private sentiments of every one? And, to say nothing of the stains and disgraces of his youth, what other remarkable event is there in his quaestorship, that first step to honour, except that Cnaeus Carbo was robbed by his quaestor of the public money? that the consul was plundered and betrayed? his army deserted? his province abandoned? the holy nature and obligations imposed on him by lot  violated?—whose lieutenancy was the ruin of all Asia and Pamphylia, in which provinces he plundered many houses, very many cities, all the shrines and temples; when he renewed and repeated against Cnaeus Dolabella his ancient wicked tricks when he had been quaestor, and did not only in his danger desert, but even attack and betray the man to whom he had been lieutenant, and proquaestor, and whom he had brought into odium by his crimes;—whose only praetorship was the destruction of the sacred temples and the public works, and, as to his legal decisions, was the adjudging and awarding of property contrary to all established rules and precedents.\"  \n\nLikewise the extension of the Roman Empire did not lead to debt, as expenditure was contingent upon the strategic environment Rome faced at any one point in time. When Rome confronted powers like Sassanian Persia and the growth of Germanic confederations in he 4th and 5th centuries AD, then military expenditure required greater taxation, but against Parthia and the disunited Germanic peoples in the 1st century AD, Rome was able to maintain it's ascendancy without needing to expand it's military establishment.\n\nSources\n\n\nAgain Varres, by Cicero:\n\nhttps://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Against_Verres/First_pleading\n\nThe Age of Confucian Rule: The Song Transformation of China, by Dieter Kuhn\n\nThe Byzantine Empire 1025-1204: A Political History, by Michael Angold\n\nThe Carolingians : A Family Who Forged Europe, by Pierre Riché  \n\nChina's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty, by Mark Edward Lewis\n\nA History of the Byzantine State and Society, by Warren Treadgold.\n\nThe Reign of Tiberius, Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus, by Tacitus:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7959\n\nThe Republic, by Plato: \n\nhttp://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.html\n\n",

        "text": "If you haven't heard of *Holy Blood, Holy Grail*, it's probably one of the most famous works of pseudo-history ever. Its basic hypothesis is that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and one of their children married into the Merovingian dynasty. Now, the notion that Jesus could have been married is certainly possible and so is the idea that he could have had descendants. That's not why I find HBHG annoying. I find it annoying because it's filled with countless errors and dubious assumptions. It's about as accurate as *The Da Vinci Code* and at least *The Da Vinci Code* had the excuse of having being sold primarily as fiction.  \n\nAbout 90% of *Holy Blood, Holy Grail* is based on forgeries concocted by [Pierre Plantard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Plantard) with the help of [Philippe de Chérisey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_de_Ch%C3%A9risey). Plantard and the novelist Gérard de Sède when wrote a book based on these forged parchments called *L'Or de Rennes*. This book claimed that the mysterious treasure of Rennes-le-Château were parchments detailing the survival of the Merovingian line. Specifically, it was claimed that Plantard was an agantic descendant of the otherwise obscure Merovingian king, Dagobert II and thus, the true heir to the French throne. At the time, this claim was meaningless as France was a republic, but even if Plantard had tried this prank a thousand years ago, the best he possibly could have hoped for was being laughed at. (In the worst case scenario, he would have been laughed at and then executed for being an imposter.)  \n\nAt any rate, *L'Or de Rennes* also claimed that these super secret descendants of the Merovingians were protected by an organization known as the Priory of Sion of which the Knights Templar were the military offshoot. Plantard and Sède later fell out with each other over royalties and then Chérisey admitted to having forged the parchments. Unfortunately, the authors of *Holy Blood, Holy Grail* weren't aware of this. It should be noted that the claim that the Merovingians were descended from Jesus is their hypothesis alone; Plantard never claimed such a thing. After finding out about Plantard's forgeries, Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln decided to insist that Plantard was a liar but that the history of the Priory of Sion was still totally true. Unfortunately, even if you were to ignore the forgeries, the book is still riddled with errors.  Here's only a tiny bit of the some of the errors I've found.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;It is known that in 1070 ... a specific band of monks, from Calabria ... arrived in the vicinity of the Ardennes Forest, part of Godfroi de Bouillon’s domains. On their arrival in the Ardennes, the Calabrian monks obtained the patronage of Mathilde de Toscane ... who was Godfroi de Bouillon’s aunt and ... foster-mother. (p. 113)  \n\nThere's legend that Matilde of Tuscany founded Orval Abbey and it's possible that she did indeed fund them, but Orval Abbey itself claims that they were founded with the patronage of Arnoul I, count of Chiny. \n\nMatilde being Godefroy de Bouillon's foster mother is an odd statement and I don't know if the authors originated it or if it was Gérard de Sède. There is no reason to suppose that Godefroy spent his childhood anywhere but Boulogne and maybe some parts of England (his father had some lands there, because he took part in the Battle of Hastings). The woman who seems to have been the biggest influence on Godefroy's life was his biological mother, Saint Ide of Lorraine. \n\nLater on, the authors try to claim that Godefoy was elected as the ruler of Jerusalem by monks that Matilde had supported with the implication being that Matilde helped him get elected. But Matilde actually doesn't seem to have liked Godefroy very much, nor does he seem to have liked her. The two of them fought over who got to inherit what after the assassination of Godefroid the Hunchback (Godefroy's maternal uncle and Matilde's distant cousin, stepbrother, and husband) in 1076. The rumors that Matilde had ordered Godefroid's assassination and the fact that Matilde and Godefroy were on opposite sides of the Investiture Controversy probably didn't help their relationship any. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;And yet Godfroi seems to have known beforehand that he would be selected. Alone among the European commanders, he renounced his fiefs, sold all his goods and made it apparent that the Holy Land, for the duration of his life, would be his domain. (p. 114)  \n\nGodefroi de Bouillon sold some of his lands and mortgaged others because he needed money to pay for the weapons, armor, horses, food, and transportation he'd need to go on Crusade in the first place. Fellow Crusader Robert Curthose mortgaged Normandy to his brother, William Rufus, for the same reason. \n\nMedieval European aristocrats were generally rich in land, not currency, so we they needed money quickly for war, they'd usually have to mortgage their castles and lands. Some nobles chose to sack churches and abbeys to get some quick funding, but that wasn't really an option open to would-be crusaders for obvious reasons. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;The Merovingians also claimed direct descent from ancient Troy which, whether true or not, would serve to explain the occurrence in France of Trojan names like Troyes and Paris. (p. 243)  \n\nThe names of Troyes and Paris come from the Tricasses and Parisii, respectively. Both were Celtic tribes who were named such by the Romans centuries before the Franks showed up.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;For the Sicambrian Franks, from whom the Merovingians issued, the bear enjoyed a similar exalted status. Like the ancient Arcadians they worshipped the bear in the form of Artemis or, more specifically, the form of her Gallic equivalent, Arduina, patron goddess of the Ardennes. (p. 244)  \n\nArduinna was a Celtic goddess, not a Germanic one and she was associated with boars, not bears. The authors try ater on to connect the name of the Ardennes forest with Artemis, because that would somehow prove that the Arcadians migrated to the Ardennes region and thus, the Merovingians were Arcadians who fled from Troy. There's a simpler explanation, though: the Franks were no more Trojan than the Romans were and their similarities between Arduinna and Artemis come from Arduinna having become syncretized with the Roman Diana when the Romans colonized Gaul. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;If Wilfrid had expected him to be a sword-arm of the Church, Dagobert proved nothing of the sort. On the contrary he seems to have curbed attempted expansion on the part of the Church within his realm, and thereby incurred ecclesiastical displeasure. A letter from an irate Frankish prelate to Wilfrid exists, condemning Dagobert for levying taxes, for “scorning the churches of God together with their bishops’. (p. 260)  \n\nThe source is Book V, chapter 44 of Gregory of Tours' *History of the Franks*. Unfortunately, Book V, chapter 44 of *History of the Franks* is actually about Gregory's fight with [Chilperic I of Neustria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilperic_I) over Chilperic's attempt to redefine the Trinity. I can't find anything exactly like the quote that the authors of HBHG in *History of the Franks*, but that may be a difference in translation. The closest I can find in the translation available on archive.org is, \"You know what respect should be paid to the churches of God; you cannot take them unless you give a pledge of their permanent union, and likewise proclaim that they shall remain free from every bodily punishment.\" This statement is directed at a Frankish dux named Rauching -- not Dagobert II.  \n\nI thought that maybe Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh were confusing Gregory of Tours' work with the anonymous 8th century *Liber Historiae Francorum*, but there's nothing there, either. Chapter 44 of *Liber Historiae Francorum* is about the reign of [Clovis II of Neustria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_II) and how (in the opinion of the anonymous author) he was pure evil. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;In any case, there is no question that by 790 Theodoric’s son, Guillem de Gellone, held the title of count of Razes the title Sigisbert is said to have possessed and passed on to his descendants. (p. 269)  \n\nThe title \"count of Razès\" was a Carolingian creation. Far from inheriting any titles, Charlemagne simply appointed his cousin, [Guilhem of Gellone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Gellone) as the count of Toulouse and duke of Septimania. The first count of Razès was someone named Berà who also the Count of Barcelona. Berà has traditionally been called a son of Guilhem of Gellone, but Guilhem's will makes no mention of him. He could be the son named \"Barnardo\", but the Barnardo referred to in the Will was most likely Bernard of Septimania. \n\nAt any rate, noble titles were not hereditary during the early Carolingian area. Counts and dukes were often appointed for life, but their children would not inherit the titles. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;By their contemporaries, for-example, the Cathars were believed to have been in possession of the Grail. (p. 291\n\nThe first person to draw a connection between the Cathars and the Holy Grail was a 19th century occultist named Joséphin Péladan. He reached this conclusion after devoting many hours of careful study to *La Canso de la Crosada* and Pierre de les Vaux-de-Cernay's *Historia Albigensis* which mention the Holy Grail so many times in their accounts of Cathars-- oh wait, no, Péladan just made it all up. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Godfroi de Bouillon, for instance, was descended according to medieval legend and folklore from Lohengrin, the Knight of the Swan; and Lohengrin, in the romances, was the son of Perceval or Parzival, protagonist of all the early Grail stories. (pp. 291-292)  \n\nThe earliest versions of *The Tale of the Knight of the Swan* had no connection to Godefroi de Bouillon. The version first connected with Godefroi tells of the Swan Knight Elias who saves the Duchess of Bouillon from the Duke of Saxony and marries the Duchess' daughter, Beatrice. Elias and Beatrice then have a daughter, Ide, whose destiny is to bear great sons who will save Jerusalem one day. It's great story, but even William of Tyre suspected that it wasn't true. And it isn't: Godefroi's actual maternal grandparents were Godefroid the Bearded, Duke of Lower Lorraine and his wife, Doda. \n\nWolfram von Eschenbach later incorporated the earlier versions of the tale of the Swan Knight into *Parzival*, gave the Knight of the Swan the name Lohengrin and made him Parzival's son. Eschenbach's *Lohengrin* keeps the unhappy ending of the original tales of the Swan Knight where he abandons his bride (named Elsa in Eschenbach's tale), because she broke a taboo of some sort.  \n\nA problem that Baigent, Lincoln, and Leigh don't seem to have noticed is that the Swan Knight was always Ide's father, not Eustache's. Thus, even if you chose to interpret medieval romances literally, the notion that the tale of the Swan Knight is a coded reference about Godefroi's supposed agnatic descent from the Merovingians falls apart.     \n\t\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Certainly the Merovingian kings do not seem to have been anti-Semitic. On the contrary they seem to have been not merely tolerant, but downright sympathetic to the Jews in their domains ... On the whole the Merovingian attitude towards Judaism seems to have been without parallel in Western history prior to the Lutheran Reformation. p. 412  \n\nAround 629, Dagobert I ordered all the Jews in his dominions to convert or leave. It doesn't seem to have been permanent, the way that Edward I's eviction of the Jews from England was, but it still shows that the Merovingians were not perfectly tolerant of Jews. (It's worth noting that Bernard S. Bachrach speculated that Dagobert's motive for this decree may have been because of Frankish Jews' sympathies for his enemy, Brunhilda of Austrasia.) On the other hand, it's true that pogroms seldom occurred in Merovingian-ruled Francia, but that was also true of the rest of Europe during the Early Middle Ages. Pogroms didn't start becoming common until the High Middle Ages. \n\nI'm not sure what to make of the claim \"prior to the Lutheran Reformation\" ... Are the authors not aware that Martin Luther was quite the vehement anti-Semite?   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;At the least this was extremely interesting for the house of Anjou was closely associated with both the Templars and the Holy Land. Indeed Fulques, Count of Anjou, himself became, so to speak, an “honorary’ or part time Templar. In 1131, moreover, he married Godfroi de Bouillon’s niece, the legendary Melusine, and became king of Jerusalem. (p. 414)  \n\n*Foulques* V, count of Anjou married *Mélisende* of Jerusalem in 1129 and they had a son, Baudouin III of Jerusalem, in 1130. Queen Mélisende as the origin of the Melusine stories doesn't work. Other than both having names that start with \"Mel\", the biography of the real Mélisende does not significantly overlap in any real way with the Melusine stories. What the Melusine stories do have a lot in common with are the worldwide legends of shapeshifting lovers-- kitsune, selkies, swan maidens, and the like. \n\nMélisende was *not* Godefroi de Bouillon's niece. Her father, Baudouin II of Jerusalem, is often called a cousin of Godefroi and his brothers, but the exact way they were related is uncertain.  \n\nOrderic Vitalis did claim that Foulques financed the Templars, but financing a religious order is not the same thing as joining it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;And in the tenth century a certain Hugues de Plantard -nicknamed “Long Nose’ and a lineal descendant of both Dagobert and Guillem de Gellone became the father of Eustache, first Count of Boulogne. Eustache’s grandson was Godfroi de Bouillon ... (p. 422)  \n\nThe footnote in HPHG says: \"It is with Godfroi’s grandfather, Comte Eustache Ier de Boulogne, that the confusion begins. His father is not recorded, only the name of his mother, Adeline, and her second husband, Ernicule, Count of Boulogne. Ernicule adopted the young Eustache, making him heir. His true father is lost to history.\" \n\nHowever, no one other than the Sion forgers have ever suggested that Eustache I of Boulogne was adopted. His father was originally identified as Arnoul III, count of Boulogne, but it's more likely that Eustache was Arnoul's grandson and his father was Baudouin I or II, count of Boulogne. (The numbering varies; it depends on whether you count Baudouin II, margrave of Flanders as the first count of Boulogne.) Now, there is a very good possibility that Eustache I's father was the mysterious count of Boulogne who died in battle with Enguerrand I, count of Ponthieu, but there is nothing to support the idea that Eustache was not a biological member of the House of Boulogne. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSources:  \n\nA Long History.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5xocyy/in_which_sofia_is_occupied_for_45_years_by_the/",
        "text": "So, I recently had the fortune of acquiring Civilization V, a very good game, mechanic-wise. And as I was playing around as Austria, planning how to annex all the delicious city-states, when I encountered Sofia! Oh, how happy I was to learn that my country *finally* has some representation in the Civ franchise! (Just wait until we get Bulgar/ians in Civ VII!)\n\nSadly, I was rather...well, *disappointed*. Yes, yes, I know that I shouldn't be picky, but still. First of all, what bugged me out was the **Militaristic** characteristic that Sofia was given. While the Army School was first established there (and the history of Sofia is rather bloody), it's unfair to say that all Sofia did was war. Indeed, even before the Liberation, in the 16th century, there was the brief existence of the Sofia Literary School^*[2]*, and after 1878, of course, it became a cultural centre. Of course, this shows more the fact that the groupings of City States are more inflexible than badhistory, but I felt that this had to be cleared out. \n\nThen, I decided to check out the [Civilopedia entry]( http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Sofia_\\(Civ5\\)). Oh. \n\n&gt;Capital and largest city of Bulgaria, Sofia lies in the center of the Balkan Peninsula. The Serdi, a Thracian tribe, first settled the area c. 700 BC; around 29 BC the Serdi settlement was conquered by the Romans. The town, lying on an important trade route through the Balkans, flourished during the emperor Trajan's reign (98-117 AD), and reached its height of prosperity and peace during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Constantine. Thereafter, Sofia's history is primarily one of strife, war and conquest. \n\nNow, this is mostly okay, although there's proof that it was inhabited even beforehand by the Tilataei tribe^*[1]* before the Serds settled in, but that's more or less nitpicking. Unfortunately, the last sentence is annoying me. It paints this painting that it was constant war ever since. Yes, it did exchange hands, many, many times. But once more, Civ's typical approach to nuance comes here - with a hammer. For all the strife and war, there was just as much construction, art, culture, etc etc. Being placed in a central place in the Balkan peninsula, it was also a centre of trade, and was even the centre of the komitats (aka province) organised by Khan Omurtag!\n\n&gt;The city was largely destroyed by the invasion of the Huns in 447 AD. Rebuilt by the Emperor Justinian I, in 809 the city was seized by the Bulgarian khan Krum. The Bulgars were supplanted by the Ottoman Turks in 1382. Following the failed crusade of Wladyslaw III of Poland to liberate Bulgaria, the city's Christian elite was annihilated and it became the capital of the Ottoman province of Rumelia for the next four centuries. \n\nTwo things here: first, by 1382, there were no Bulgars at all. You could only talk about Bulgarians, aka the ethnic mix between assimilated Bulgars, Pechenegs and Cumans (it's a mess) and Slavs. Bulgars by then faded out of existence. Secondly, the part about Sofia being capital of the Ottoma province of Rumelia is correct, to an extent. It was the capital of the Rumelia eyalet, but by 1520, the [Sofia sanjak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumelia_Eyalet#1520s) isn't even part of it!  \n \nThe third paragraph is mostly basic history of post-1878 Bulgaria, and beyond the curious use of quote marks around the Autonomous Principality of Bulgaria, there's not much to say.\n\nAND FINALLY. WHAT YOU'VE ALL CAME HERE FOR.\n\n&gt;In the political shambles left by the war, the inter-war years were a period of internal strife and bloodshed. Bulgaria joined the Axis Powers in 1941, with the result that Sofia was heavily bombed by Allied air forces in 1943 and occupied by the Red Army in September 1944. **The Soviet occupation would last until the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, latest act in the city's long history of turmoil.**\n\nLook. I know it. Eastern Europe? Hard to do stuff for it. I'm from there and I know it just as well. But Jesus Christ, how the fuck can you get this wrong? For those of you keeping track at home, Sofia wasn't occupied by the Soviets for 45 years. Hell, when the Red Army entered the country, they were greeted rather amicably by the local populace. Not exactly resisting occupation, now were they. One could argue that the newly established People's Republic of Bulgaria is a satellite state, and that'd be true. But they're not an occupation force. Not at all. It was ran by Bulgarians, *mostly* for Bulgarians. Finally, regime change here in Sofia passed by peacefully, with the resignation of Jivkov from the Party, which was mostly followed by protests against the newly established socialist government. Not quite tanks in the capital of Baltics.\n\nUltimately, I like Civ5 as a game. It's pretty good. But there's some glaring history holes there. \n\nHey, this is my first post on r/badhistory. I hope I did well. Please tell me if you have any questions or criticism.\n\nSources:\n\nMostly Wikipedia, but also: \n\n[1][Sofia Literary School](https://books.google.bg/books?id=vrd0DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Sofia+literary+school&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HPbY8UHwrp&amp;sig=q7syHKJQgIN8whoy99n2ILgsF4E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtp7R-7_SAhVDLZoKHbUDAbEQ6AEITjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sofia%20literary%20school&amp;f=false)\n\n[2] *The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I.

I'm going to focus on the first half of the visual feces. If anyone wants to jump in on the second half, feel free.  \n\nThe evolution of human society was complicated and, amazingly, a cooperative affair where different peoples and cultures exchanged ideas and technologies. A great many of these were developed by people who would not be considered \"white\" (although the idea of referring to neolithic and Bronze Age peoples as \"white\" is badhistory itself). [Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture), the [written word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing), [permanent structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_architecture), [beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_beer), and many other building blocks of what makes society civilized were born in places like Egypt, the Levant, and Mesopotamia. There's also the wealth of technologies and concepts developed independently in China and other parts of Southeast Asia. As well, some of the core concepts of mathematics were created outside of Europe, such as [Arabic numerals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system). \n\nThis is by no means a comprehensive list, but it is a handful of useful examples to show how civilization can't be considered a \"white\" creation. \n\n",

However, I present for your consideration (and cringe-filled amusement) a variation on this said to me by a classmate in my English class that I, at least, have never heard or seen anywhere before: that \"the Treaty Versailles caused the Great Depression.\"\n\nR5: What even the fuck? The Treaty of Versailles ended World War I in 1919 and can be paraphrased as saying \"Screw you, Germany.\" The Great Depression was a global economic depression that started when the American stock market crashed in 1929. I'm sure the causes of the stock market crash that lead to the Great Depression are large and complex and very interesting to learn about, but I don't think the Treaty of Versailles was one of them, much less the main cause.\n\nI'm honestly kind of disappointed that there's not more to say here. I think the only Great Depression-related badhistory I've ever heard that was worse came from myself, at around 7 years of age, thinking that the Gold Rush and the Great Depression were two names for the same thing.",

Its one thing to be incompetent but FDR was intentionally dangerous and destructive. But Polk is definitely in my top 10 worst tho.\n\nand\n\n&gt;The reason why I place FDR as the worst is for the following: 80% of the U.S Economy was controlled by the FED, he oversaw one of the largest expansion of federal government in U.S History, his poor economic policies/planning made the great depression worse, he successfully pushed a 90%+ tax on the wealthiest among us, he pushed a 106% tax, he caused on the greatest redistribution of wealth in U.S history which killed any job growth, he violated the civil rights of American citizens en-masse and was the closest thing objectively we ever had to a dictator.\n\n&gt;Not to mention, we won the war AFTER he died AND the economy boomed AFTER he died. There's a reason we prevent Presidents from a third term and his name is FDR. \n\n---\nOn Hayes:\n\n&gt;Hayes ended reconstruction way to early and caused the rise of Jim Crow laws in the south. Not to mention his actions destroyed the black political class in the South and he failed to protect Americans from southern terrorism.\n\n---\nOn Hoover:\n\n&gt;Hoover certainly contributed to the cause of the Great Depression and FDR made it last much longer than it should \n\n---\n\nOn the omission of Washington, Jefferson, and T. Roosevelt:\n\n&gt;While they are each great, they don't earn the top 5 list in my opinion. TBH washington was a decent president no the G.O.A.T.\n\n---\nOn the ranking \"system\":\n\n&gt;I'm trying to measure them based on positive economic impact, national growth and limited government. Trying really hard to avoid personal opinion\n\n---\n\nAnd with that, I wish to give an altogether too brief of a reply.\n\nTo begin, I'm quite out of touch with my American Presidential history, so I think the most effective criticism I can muster is going to being an assessment of the methodology. Which, from a broad perspective is limited and heavily biased. As James MacGregor Burns points out about Nixon, [\"How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#cite_ref-4) This is indeed born out by both Nixon's [triumphs (such as establishing the EPA and OSHA among others)](http://us-presidents.insidegov.com/q/7/9699/What-were-President-Richard-Nixon-s-accomplishments) but also his failings, such as Watergate or [starting the War on Drugs](http://us-presidents.insidegov.com/l/7/Richard-Nixon#Issues&amp;s=3E5v6n). I suppose what I'm getting at is that there are so many ways in order to rate, rank and assess the Presidents that the methodology is simply sophomoric. For instance their preference towards limited government stands directly against their reasoning for [Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Richard_Nixon) and [Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Ulysses_S._Grant), who based on my reading, were two very \"hands on\" Presidents, and took an active role in governance. So the question at the heart of my disagreement is, why limited government as a central criteria then, if two of the supposed best President's by this reckoning were by all means fairly hands on in their use of Federal Power in most cases. It's almost as if the criteria are selectively utilized by my \"friend\" in order to fit the narrative they have already made up in their mind...but what do I know?\n\n---\n\nI hope I was able to bring something decently amusing to a few people as well as provide only a semi-haphazard attempt at elucidating why I find this to be Bad History material.

(Who knew Washington and Lincoln were the only ones, amirite?) Yesterday, I checked Facebook against my better judgement, and came across a really fun one.\n\nBefore I post it, here's a disclaimer: I don't have any intention of talking about our current president, and even if R2 didn't exist, I have absolutely no desire to simply because it's a touchy subject and I don't need that. What I want to discuss in this bad history example is not the analysis (if it can be so called), but the *method.* [Here it is](https://imgur.com/a/3l39d). May the admins have mercy on my soul.\n\nOk, so again, we're not discussing modern politics here, so I want to change the viewpoint to something less contentious: let's pretend that the bottom part instead addresses, say, Thomas Jefferson. If I put Abraham Lincoln's best public quote up top, and then something about how Thomas Jefferson used to bang his slaves despite also banging on about liberty and equality, well of course I'm going to make Jefferson look like an ass.\n\nNow you could argue that Jefferson did a lot to make himself look like an ass, and you'd be right. He was a bit of a dick. But what would happen if I took Thomas Jefferson's best pubic quote, put that on top, and then underneath had a picture of Lincoln with the quote \"Negro equality? Fudge!\" or pointed out that Lincoln imprisoned dissidents and journalists, whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence? Now who looks like an ass?\n\nThe issue, as I'm sure you've guessed, is that people can often be asses. They can also sometimes be really good or do really good things while still being asses. Both Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln were dicks at one point or another, but also got a lot of good things done. That's what happens when you deal with people, which, spoiler alert, history does.\n\nThat's not to say, of course, that some historical figures tend to average more good than others. I don't think anyone would argue seriously that Lincoln was not better than Hitler, for instance. But when we're discussing people, we have to examine both sides of that person, even when we like one of them and not the other.\n\nCase in point: Eric Foner's *the Fiery Trial* is, like any Eric Foner book, fairly laudatory of Abraham Lincoln. Yet, Foner, being a professional historian, does not shy away from Lincoln's blemishes. Sure, Foner paints the standard \"evolving viewpoint\" picture of Lincoln, but he also concedes that Lincoln was a politician first, and that political considerations came first. The \"fudge\" letter and Lincoln's abuses of executive power are discussed. This doesn't take away from Lincoln or the positive view Foner creates. It simply accurately describes a human who makes mistakes trying to do a difficult job. Lincoln comes off, not as an untouchable god, because that's not believable or relateable, but as simply a good man on average. Because that picture is a realistic one, it's actually more effective in convincing us that Lincoln was, overall, a great and good guy, even if, yes, he did some things we might not like.\n\nThis is not unique to Foner, and just to prove I don't have a raging Foner boner (even though I totally do), admitting your subject's flaws is common (as it should be) in the historical field. Michael Neufeld's biography of von Braun, *Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War,* is extremely positive about its subject - but still addresses that von Braun was probably aware his projects used slave labor and were applied to trying to take over Europe. *To Purge this Land with Blood,* *the* biography of John Brown by Stephen Oates, still talks about how Brown beat his kids and, oh yeah, that thing by the river with the broadswords. Oates loves John Brown. Full disclosure: so do I. But you can't talk about him without talking about Pottawatomie. You just can't.\n\nThe bottom line here is that you can't compare two people by selectively taking one person's best and matching it against someone else's worst, no matter who it is. It's bad history. Lincoln is frequently compared to others, which is bad enough, since he's arguably one of the best if not the best president in American history, but when you take Lincoln's best and put it against someone, anyone's, worst, that comparison isn't helpful as historical analysis. I understand that Facebook is an echo chamber and that anyone who gets their history from the Daily Show probably tacitly understands that what they're getting isn't professional level history, but when you put forth such obviously lopsided historical comparisons, you open yourself up to someone else doing the same, as in our Lincoln vs. Jefferson example. If you want to compare two figures to make a point, that's fine. But at least make sure it makes sense. That's all I'd ask.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5uqifs/alltime10s_discusses_the_german_invasion_of/",
        "text": "For all those who don't know, Alltime10s is a pretty famous youtube channel well known for generating countdowns of the top 10 of anything you can think of. And occasionally, their videos have fuck-ups in them.  \n\nTake [this one,](https://youtu.be/z1i6wX6ctgs?t=7m10s) in which they state that Napoleon and Hitler invaded Russia while being \"completely unprepared.\"  \n\nFor one, no army executes any offensive operation without any preparation whatsoever, primarily because well, there's a reason it's called an \"operation.\" You don't just throw troops at the enemy like wood into a fire, you make sure that you can actually cause serious harm to the enemy. Hence, to state that the French and the Germans were \"completely unprepared\" while invading Russia is wrong on a fundamental level.  \n\nFurthermore, there are many factors that complicate a discussion of how \"stupid\" Barbarossa supposedly was. I'm only going to deal with the German invasion of the Soviet Union as that is a topic I have some knowledge in, but if anyone is willing to discuss the French invasion in a similar context, they are welcome to do so.  \n\n[Military History Visualized](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ft-dYaZKxwU) has made a great video on the same topic. To put it simply (a) hindsight is always 20/20 (b) Germany won in almost every engagement on the eastern front in WWI in spite of numerical inferiority, which ultimately culminated in the collapse of the Russian army and forced them to sign a peace treaty (c) The Germans also utterly crushed armies in the western front at the beginning of WW2, through highly successful mobile warfare, something that they never managed to do in WW1 (d) The Red Army was still terribly incompetent at the beginning of WW2, thanks to Stalin's utterly idiotic purges, incompetence that was highlighted by the heavy casualties suffered by the Soviets during the Winter War of 1939-1940. This incompetence served to undermine the Red Army's reputation. Hence, if we look back at the context of 1940, the Red Army truly did appear to be inferior in comparison to Nazi Germany's armed forces.   \n\nIn addition, the Germans, as I implied earlier, did undergo a significant amount of preparation before Barbarossa. The plans can be seen on [this wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#German_invasion_plans) Part of the planning involved reviewing Napoleon's failed invasion.  \n\n&gt;German military planners also researched Napoleon's failed invasion of Russia. In their calculations, they concluded that there was little danger of a large-scale retreat of the Red Army into the Russian interior, as it could not afford to give up the Baltic states, Ukraine, or the Moscow and Leningrad regions, all of which were vital to the Red Army for supply reasons and would thus have to be defended.\n\nThe very fact that they did carefully review and make some sort of risk assessment shows that a significant amount of thought was put into the whole thing.  \n\nThat is not to say that the German invasion plan wasn't without its flaws. The Germans had a persistent knack of underestimating Soviet strength and tenacity, thought that the war would be over in a few months, and failed to give two flying fucks for logistics over the vast expanse of the Soviet Union thanks in part to poor communication between logisticians and the high command, among many, many other failings. These were failures that Nazi Germany would pay for dearly in May 1945, as Berlin was reduced to a pile of smoking rubble. HOWEVER, there is a difference between saying that the Germans were **poorly** prepared as compared to saying that they were **completely** unprepared. It is inaccurate and disrespectful to imply that the Allies had to put in so much effort to take down an enemy that was supposedly formed of a bunch of incompetent, bumbling fuckwits who couldn't put two and two together.\n\n",

And the Seminoles originally lived in the nicer parts of Florida and only retreated to the swamps when it was time for war. Also the US army during the Second Seminole War spent 40 million USD- over a billion dollars in today's money ( made more impactful with the fact that tax revenue was proportionality a lot lower) and send over 40000 men to fight to a stalemate with a tribe of only a few thousand. Not to mention the hell the Apaches gave the US army so to say that they had inferior tactics to the Americans is just wrong, or when the Comanche completely destroyed North Mexico and threatened the very existence of the Texan republic\n This is perhaps not as bad as some of the other posts here but the fact is, that it isn't the fact that the land they lived on was unattractive for white people, but that their terrain combined with their tactics made it hard for conventional European armies to fight against, thus hard for them to settle. The Cherokee removal never came to war, if it it would have coasted the US a lot of money and resources to remove the Cherokee by force if it really came to it. Why do you think Jackson would buy the lands of various tribes rather than direct conquest?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5tyhvg/25_years_later_eric_lindros_finally_puts_onthe/",
        "text": "One of the most contentious, and controversial, moments in National Hockey League (NHL) history occurred on June 22, 1991.  Of all things that could possibly be the source of controversy, it was the league's annual Entry Draft that was the center of the firestorm.  And more specifically, it was a very talented 18-year-old named Eric Lindros that was the eye of the center of the firestorm.\n\nFrom the time that he had a massive growth spurt some years prior, Lindros' name was whispered in awed tones within hockey circles.  Whereas Wayne Gretzky was small and sublimely skilled, and Mario Lemieux was big but not overly physical but still sublimely skilled, Lindros looked to be at the forefront of a new wave of players: the all-around legend.  Gretzky and Lemieux could skate past and elude defenders en route to the opposing team's net, but Lindros could simply run through them.  He possessed the elite talent that only seemed to come along once a generation, but also the physical size - and willingness to use it - that no one else seemed to.\n\nThere was no question that Lindros would reach the highest strata of NHL stardom.  He would dominate junior hockey, be drafted first overall by some horrid team, become an immediate sensation, quickly turn the fortunes of that horrid team, win a couple of Stanley Cups, and go into the Hockey Hall of Fame.\n\nInstead, fate took a funny turn.  Lindros was drafted first overall into the junior Ontario Hockey League by the Soo Greyhounds, but he refused to play for them.  A year later, he was traded to the Oshawa Generals and proceeded to dominate the rest of the regular season with them.  In the OHL playoffs, he scored over a goal *and* and an assist per game en route to a league championship and a Memorial Cup.\n\nThen came the year everyone was waiting for: the 1990-91 season.  For the 17-year-old Lindros, this was his draft year; in the NHL, this was the sweepstakes to see who would finish last overall and earn the right to draft him.  Many felt that it would be the lowly Quebec Nordiques who would finish in the basement for a third straight year, giving them three consecutive 1st overall draft picks.  Everyone knew that it would not be the Edmonton Oilers, who had just won their fifth Stanley Cup in seven years and would *never* be in contention to have three consecutive 1st overall picks.\n\nThere was a minor stir when Quebec issued #88 to their most recent top pick, Owen Nolan.  Lindros had become synonymous with #88, and for Quebec - who had just finished a year 49 games under .500 - to give the number to anyone seemed to be a bit unusual.  Indeed:\n\n&gt;The Nords gave Lindros' No. 88 to this year's No. 1 pick Owen Nolan, supposedly to nix the idea they were going to roll over and die, though Nolan grabbed No. 11 this week when it became available.\n&gt;\n&gt;**Fuller, Lance and Hornby, Dave. \"NORDS NIX VAN DORP PROBE.\" Toronto Sun, The 11 Oct. 1990, Sports: 112**\n\n\\#11 had been previously worn by Iiro Jarvi.  I believe that it was his departure that freed up said number for Nolan, but I cannot find confirmation of this.  Jarvi played five games with the Halifax Citadels (Quebec's top farm team) before finishing the remainder of the season in Austria.\n\nBut the race to the bottom was on.  Lindros got out to a hot start, while Quebec seemed to take their idea of contending seriously.  10 games into the 80-game season, the Nordiques were 3-4-3 and weren't rolling over for anybody.\n\nThen they fell apart.  0-10-0 in their next 10-game stretch, then 2-5-3 in the next 10...at the halfway point, they were 9-24-7 and showing no signs of emerging.\n\nLindros, meanwhile, was dominating the OHL.  And while Quebec was stumbling into the second half of the season, Lindros was putting on a clinic at the World Junior Championships.  His 17 points in the 7-game tournament were 6 more than Mike Craig, and more than double any other player on Team Canada.\n\nQuebec went 1-7-2 in their next 10 games, then 2-7-1 in the next 10, then 2-6-2 in the next 10, and then a final 2-6-2 run that brought their 1990-91 season to a merciful end with a dismal 16-50-14 record.  The only consolation was that they would be picking first overall again, and that the obvious choice (Lindros) was in the process of another deity-level OHL playoffs.\n\nAnd then we get to the actual draft.  Lindros was none too thrilled with the idea of going to Quebec City, and announced beforehand that he would not play there even if selected.  The most talented prospect since Mario Lemieux was now making a statement that hadn't been made in the NHL since Lemieux.  In Lemieux's case, his refusal to put on a Pittsburgh Penguins jersey when he was drafted came down to a simple contract dispute.  In Lindros' case, his refusal would be over many more things: Quebec was too small, too isolated, and too bad of a franchise to consider playing for.  This was the day of huge athletic endorsements in addition to growing salaries, and while Gretzky had Los Angeles and Michael Jordan had Chicago, no one could be a legendary star in Quebec.\n\nSo Lindros had his name called, and he refused to put on the Nordiques jersey.  It was one of their light blue road jerseys with white collar and white fleur-de-lis, but it was notable for three reasons:\n\n* It had #1 on it instead of the draft year, in defiance of recent draft jersey convention\n* The name and numbers appear to actually be twill that was sewn onto the jersey, which was the first time in Quebec franchise history that they had done this.  Previously, everything was heat-sealed vinyl film.\n* The #1 was white trimmed in red, whereas all game jerseys from 1979-80 through the end of 1990-91 had one-color numbers.\n\nTwo-color sewn numbers would mark the new standard for Quebec, and even today the game jerseys starting in 1991-92 carry a large premium compared to their predecessors.\n\nLindros and Quebec would never come to terms on a contract.  Lindros would begin the 1991-92 season in the Canada Cup, where he would finish 6th on Team Canada in scoring (behind only Gretzky, Steve Larmer, Mark Messier, Paul Coffey, and Al MacInnis).  Then he'd play for the Canadian National Team, where he was dominant...then with the same team in the Olympics, where he was dominant...then back to the OHL, where he was dominant.\n\nAt the 1992 Entry Draft, the Lindros/Nordiques saga came to an end as he was traded to Philadelphia for a massive trade package that included numerous players, draft picks, and $15 million cash.\n\nWhich brings us to the present day.\n\nEarlier this week, on the February 12 episode of the CBC Radio show \"Tout Le Monde En Parle\", Lindros was interviewed about what all went into not just his refusal to play for Quebec, but to not even so much as wear the team's jersey when he was drafted.  At the conclusion of the interview, Lindros was presented with a #88 Nordiques jersey with his name on it.  And for the first time, we finally got an idea of what he might have looked like in such a uniform.  [The presentation begins around 15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKpeVy-G2WA).\n\nConsidering what a phenom Lindros was coming in, and how notable his refusal to wear the jersey in the first place was, this was a major event.  It drew mentions on [Yahoo! Sports](https://sports.yahoo.com/news/eric-lindros-finally-puts-on-quebec-nordiques-jersey-for-first-time-171650917.html) and on [Sportsnet](http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/eric-lindros-wears-nordiques-sweater-first-time/).\n\nHowever, there are several issues with what exactly Lindros was presented with.  Even setting aside the fact that the jersey itself appears to be a modern reproduction from the CCM Vintage line, the name is a bit...off.  I couldn't remember where I had seen the name typeface before, and then it hit me: the Colorado Avalanche use it.  That's the very same Colorado Avalanche who were previously known as the Quebec Nordiques before moving west in 1995.\n\nDon't believe me?  [This](http://akamai.edeal.com/images/catalog2381/folder12235/img9959001.jpg) shows the back of a 2010-11 Avalanche alternate game worn jersey; I picked Craig Anderson because of the number of similar letters between his last name and Lindros' (everything except L and I).  Compare back to the earlier video of Lindros, specifically at 15:53.  [This screencap](http://i.imgur.com/DyKIb0L.jpg) should demonstrate the similarity between the two typefaces.  It also appears that the modern Lindros jersey has the letters applied directly to the jersey, rather than being applied first to a strip of fabric (a nameplate) which was then sewn to the jersey.\n\nIn 1991-92, which would have been Lindros' rookie year, he'd have worn [something like this](http://classicauctions.net/ItemImages/000108/108027d_lg.jpeg) had he suited up in Quebec.  [This example](http://classicauctions.net/ItemImages/000111/111907a_lg.jpeg) of a Mats Sundin jersey from that very season, again with multiple letters in common with Lindros (I, N, D, and S) very clearly shows the differences between the on-ice version that the Nordiques wore and what Lindros was recently presented with.\n\nIn other words, Lindros was presented with a Nordiques jersey, but one in which his very name was created in the exact style of the team that the Nordiques left town to become.\n\nEDIT: I was driving home earlier and realized that I'd also seen this same name typeface elsewhere recently but couldn't remember where.  Then I vaguely recalled handling a Saku Koivu game jersey, and when I got home I looked one of his later Montreal game jerseys up.  I then compared the Canadiens in that time period to Colorado's...perfect match.  Note the similarities between [this Guillaume Latendresse jersey](http://www.gamewornauctions.net/images/products/secondary/19151.jpg) and the ones above.  Or, [in one image](http://i.imgur.com/kHLi4fL.jpg), see all three together.\n\nAsk anyone old Nordiques fan what NHL teams they hate the most, and chances are you'll get two answers: the Montreal Canadiens because of the long-standing and very bloody rivalry between those two teams, and the Colorado Avalanche because that's what the Nordiques left town to become.  And Eric Lindros, arguably the most hated individual player in Quebec history, was given a jersey where his name was in the style of **both** of Quebec's hated rivals.",

Is this true? This would be incredibly foolish if Dice did this because... girls didn't fight in WW1! &lt;\n\nUnlike the poster claims, women did in fact fight in the first world war. \n\nImperial Russia had the Women's battalions later in the conflict, and before that many women volunteered either openly or disguised as men. Austria-Hungary had several known female soldiers, such as Viktoria Savs and the women in the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen: \n\nhttp://ww1.habsburger.net/en/persons-objects-events/viktoria-savs\n\nhttp://www.ukrainianmuseumlibrary.org/pdf/2015/Role-Dedicated-Ukr-Women-WWI.pdf\n\nThe French Marie Marvingt served both in disguise in the infantry and later as an aviator \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Marvingt\n\nFlora Sandes, Milunka Savic, Sofija Jovanovic and Slavka Tomic fought in the Serbian army\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_World_War_I\n\nEcaterina Teodoroiu became a national hero in Romania\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecaterina_Teodoroiu\n\nIn the Finnish Civil War, women fought in separate units on the side of the Red Guards.\n\nThose are just the ones I remembered/could find with a short search and with sources in english.\n\n&gt;All this political correctness shit is getting out of hand. Don't even get me started on how half the German, US, British, and seemingly French armies consist of black soldiers in this game, even though like 0.1% of soldiers who fought in Europe were black. Just completely inaccurate, racist, and offensive to the 10 million plus WHITE soldiers who were killed in WW1.  \n\nThis topic has already been discussed here, and saying \"half\" the teams consist of black soldiers is an exaggeration:\n https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/51f5j3/was_the_western_front_of_ww1_fought_with_mostly/?st=iz3y48lj&amp;sh=6ebdb468\n\n\nI'm always sad to see how little people know about history (because I love history, and wish everyone else did too ;D), and how easily they jump to assumptions. \"I've never heard of women fighting in WW1, therefore no women must have fought, this opposite evidence is political correctness being showed down my throat!\"\n\nAnyway, just wanted to vent my frustration. The comment section so far is actually rather more enlightened than is usual, as people point out he's wrong. Here's an example of the normal: https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/5tkpa8/bf1_female_soldiers_in_early_character_design/?st=iz3yd67f&amp;sh=03f232bf\n\n &gt;The last thing we need is more over-representation of a minuscule minority group that participated in the war.  \n\nOh dear.\n\nThis comment is quite lovely: \n&gt;It's just a game dude. Your not playing Dan Carlin's hardcore history. I'm almost level 100 and I don't even know which teams which or who's fighting who. It's irrelevant. The details don't matter. Just pwn noobs.\n\nEDIT: Made changes for the greater glory of Rule 5",

If you think I got something wrong don't hesitate to say in the comments!\n\n&gt;Thanks for letting it slide that [the blacks] enslaved Jews to make the pyramids\n\nAlright so two things here, firstly, the [Jewish slaves did not build the pyramids](http://harvardmagazine.com/2003/07/who-built-the-pyramids-html), and secondly, the Egyptians weren't \"black.\" [Nubia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubian_pyramids) built some Pyramids, but the Jews had very little to do with that as well.\n\n&gt;letting us [the blacks] yell that you [the whites] started the slave trade when it was us selling our own kind to you\n\nThis is wrong in a lot of different ways, of which I will list 2 and maybe fill in more later when I get around to going through my sources to double check on some things. Firstly, the conception of blacks as a \"kind\" is a little fucky. Many African polities raided for slaves of a different religion, ethnicity, or polity, and others sold prisoners of war or criminals. The \"blacks\" were not a distinct, unified, group, at least not to many of these polities. Secondly, demand is a key, dare I say essential, part of supply/demand. Isn't it interesting that after 1807 slavery began declining in everywhere but Sokoto?\n\nThat's not to say it's entirely wrong to say that Africans had a leading role in the Slave Trade, let us not remove African Agency from African History. The point is that recasting *white people* as the victims of black people forcing the Jews into building their [grain storehouses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhol3WdB4QU) and then *forcing* their slaves on them is a bit of an over-correction and also a bit factually wrong. \n\n",

You look at the most racist — you look at the Dixiecrats, they were Democrats who imposed segregation, imposed Jim Crow laws, who founded the Klan. The Klan was founded by a great many Democrats.\n\nWaPo via MSN at: http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/ted-cruz-%E2%80%98the-democrats-are-the-party-of-the-ku-klux-klan%E2%80%99/ar-AAmJYyH?li=BBmkt5R\n\nThis is perhaps one of the more common bits of bad history that gets thrown around these days -- \"liberals are the real racists!\"/\"Democrats founded the KKK!\"/etc..  Nobody likes getting tarred with the racist label and being associated with the KKK is a pretty obvious way to be tagged as such.  \n\nIt is true that in the era of Lincoln, the South was largely dominated by the Democratic party and the North was dominated by the Republican party.  One should seriously note, however, that Republicans of the time were not uniformly in favor of abolition of slavery (if I remember correctly, the early chapters of *Team of Rivals* talks about this some and the debates that were had in Lincoln's time).  Anyhow, this is where the claim that Democrats created the KKK usually comes from, and there is a kernel of truth in that the people who founded the KKK were Democrats.  There is a difference between being part of the party and having members who went on to do other things.  The establishment of Jim Crow, however is something worth talking about as it was typically from Democratic state governments.\n\nIt is quite sad that Eduardo Rafael Cruz nearly stumbles onto reality, however, but misses it.  He mentioned the Dixiecrats.  The State's Rights Democratic party (\"Dixiecrats\" is shorthand), as most of us probably know, was formed in 1948 as a reaction to the Democratic party's shift on civil rights.  President Truman formed a committee on civil rights and desegregated the US military which outraged racist segregationists in the South.  In some sense, this legacy of civil rights could be traced back to President Franklin Roosevelt -- outreach to African Americans was to encourage (paraphrasing from Robert Vann) turn the portrait of Lincoln to face the wall (https://books.google.com/books?id=P_TBRyqLTDwC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=turn+lincoln's+picture+to+the+wall+nancy+weiss+farewell+to+the+party+of+lincoln&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JLgadcmLd1&amp;sig=KRbDNoeXkcWqWsLtKI_45vIdcoY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3bbT_7wI6TB2QXSusDDCA&amp;sqi=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).  Later on, FDR's EO 8802 stated that the government would not hire based on race.  All of this led to the Dixiecrat split of 1948.  The national party had mostly turned its back on conservative/segregationist Southern Democrats.  LBJ of course only solidified this further with the Civil Rights Act.\n\nAll of this highlights the plain truth that the political parties had shifted from their positions (dramatically, even) and to attack the modern party as the \"real racists\" is pretty ridiculous.  (Heck, you could go further back to talk about how President Andrew Jackson was a Democrat and horrible to the Native Americans.  Or to claim that modern Republicans are racist imperialists based on the 1890s invasion and occupation of the Philippines during President McKinley's presidency.) Senator Eduardo Rafael Cruz should be embarrassed to utter such a piece of bad history.",

While it can be argued that the Department of Education we know and love was created in 1979, this misses a lot of nuance as well as the fact that *the Department of Education existed way prior to 1979.*\n\nCongress created the Department of Education (note the exact same fucking name) on March 2, 1867. \n\nFrom *An Act to establish a Department of Education*\n\n&gt; Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That there shall be established, at the city of Washington, a **department of education,** for the purpose of collecting such statistics and facts as shall show the condition and progress of education in the several States and Territories, and of diffusing such information respecting the organization and management of schools and school systems, and methods of teaching, as shall aid the people of the Untied States in the establishment and maintenance of efficient school systems, and otherwise promote the cause of education throughout the country.\n\nWow, sounds pretty similar to the Department of Education we have now actually. It goes on to discuss how commissioners are appointed, salary, and so on. I'm not quoting that here, but you can [go read it here.](https://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1867-act-to-establish-a-federal-department-of-education/) They even point out there that the DoE was not created in 1979 as is commonly believed, and that was written in 2011. The Department of Education was pushed by education reformers for decades prior to 1879, and it nearly came to be in the late 1850s, but various political and civil-warry things got in the way.\n\nAdmittedly, the Department of Education didn't last too long in its original form. It was renamed the Office of Education and rolled into the Department of the Interior just two years later, in 1869. It was then temporarily renamed the Bureau of Education, a moniker it bore until 1929 when it went back to the Office of Education. Under the Department of the Interior it had no real power to control national education, only to provide statistics and information. \n\nUnder the New Deal, it was transferred under the Federal Security Agency in 1939, which incorporated the Social Security Board, Public Health, Federal Drug Administration, Civilian Conservation Corps, and others.  In 1953, Eisenhower reorganized the FSA, effectively abolishing it and returning many its constituent parts to Independence. The Office of Education became a part of the newly formed U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Part of the Education Amendments of 1972 repealed the law which created the Office of Education since it no longer really existed as an independent agency. The amendments did a lot of good things too like outlawing sex discrimination, commonly known as Title IX, and making receiving federal funding easier for students. \n\nFinally in 1979, President Carter split the Department of Education off from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, creating the Department of Education we have today. This was accompanied by a new law, the Department of Education Organization Act, giving it funding, rules, and so forth. \n\nSo in a very real, very broad sense, we have had a federal office that handles national education in a form very close to, and descended from, the original Department of Education created in 1867. Saying the Department of Education was only created in 1979 (or 1980 I guess) is akin to saying the Marine Corps stopped existing when it became a part of the Department of the Navy in 1834.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/5sqba9/game_theory_discusses_11th_century_arms_and_armor/",
        "text": "So [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwoGVWgK8v8) popped up and I knew before I even started watching that it was going to be bad.  I'm not an expert on this stuff but a fair chunk of it looks wrong from what I know so I decided to do some research.  Also I'm not voicing an opinion on the actual versus match here because I think it's a silly comparison with far too many factors to accurately consider.\n\nHe starts off by saying they're going to compare a knight, viking, and samurai from the 11th century since that is the point where all three existed at once and that's fine.  Then we start looking at the Vikings.\n\nSo at about 5:35 he says that Viking lived in a place where food dies almost instantly with, for some reason, a picture of a deer.  As if animals can't live in Scandinavia or something.  On top of this he claims that Viking subsisted \"almost entirely by stealing from other people\".  It appears that actually [vikings had an agricultural society](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_weapons_overview.htm) which makes sense because supporting yourself entirely by stealing other peoples food seems like a terrible long-term strategy.\n\nAt about 5:50 he says \"their weapons were generally garbage\" and the reason for this, apparently, is that Scandinavia is cold.  I don't know enough about weapons to argue the point but that reasoning seems absolutely terrible.  He continues by saying that vikings were equipped with \"only the most basic of offenses, a bow and a shield on his back (why the shield is listed under 'offense' and why the viking would have it on his back rather than, say, his arm he doesn't mention), a spear for throwing, and an axe on their belt\".  Besides the fact that three weapons is hardly 'the most basic of offenses' [this source](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_weapons_overview.htm) seems to imply that it would be unusual for the average viking to be carrying more than a single weapon and a shield.  Again, this makes sense, weapons are expensive.\n\nAt about 6:10 we get into the armor with the line \"they were practically nudist on the defensive front ... the wealthiest vikings wore nothing but hardened leather\" when [mail was fairly common among wealthier vikings](http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_mail.htm) and continues \"but most just had quilted fabric so one good shot from a bow and you're done\".  This just brings us back to 'why is the shield in the offense section' because shields, as it turns out, are quite good at stopping arrows.\n\nAt about 7:00 he goes into why the vikings wore light armor, his two reasons being \"they went on boats a lot\" and \"light armor allowed for better mobility\".  Considering that ship-to-ship combat was probably pretty rare and you can take your armor off when you don't need it and mail doesn't really limit your maneuverability all that much I think it's safe to say the actual reason is cost.\n\nAt about 8:10 we get a battle setup worthy of Deadliest Warrior where the viking walks up and is instantly thwarted by a single arrow.  Truly the common arrow is a weapon that no viking would have ever seen or thought about in combat.\n\nThen we get into the knights.\n\nAt about 9:20 he starts getting into their equipment, saying \"Offensively in the 11th century knights were all about swords and spears or, more accurately, longswords and polearms\".  No, that's actually less accurate.  11th century knights would have used one-handed weapons as two handed weapons were more common after the introduction of plate armor allowed for less reliance on shields, longswords are generally two handed although they can be wielded in one hand.  Also as a minor point the image used for 'polearm' here is a halberd which would've become common in the [14th century](https://www.britannica.com/technology/halberd).  As far as I know halberds were not a traditional knights weapon even when they were around and would have been favored by regular infantry although I could be wrong about that.\n\nThe knights also get a mail hauberk and shield which is accurate although no mention of helmets for some reason.\n\nNow we move on to the samurai.\n\nAt about 11 minutes the samurai are described as \"like the 1%\" which strikes me as inaccurate because as far as I can remember the samurai fit into a role not dissimilar to European knights as a sort of lesser nobility on average.  I can't find a source to back this up so if someone can correct it please do.\n\nAt about 11:20 we get the phrase \"like the knights, the samurai were master practitioners of *kyudo*, the art of mounted archery\".  As far as I know knights in the 11th century were mostly melee fighters and it's doubtful any of them would have practiced mounted archery.\n\nAt about 11:50 he begins to talk about the O-Yoroi armor worn by samurai during that period, for some reason showing an image of much more modern armor as he does so.\n\nAt 12:05 we get \"while the knight's hauberk covered just their torso the samurai had huge helmets\" completely ignoring the fact that, as can be seen in [this image of Norman knights from 1066](http://world4.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/norman-soldiers-hastings-265x400.jpg), knights did wear both helmets and mail coifs.  Then he mentions that the samurai would have masks when all the examples of O-Yoroi armor I can find do not have masks.  Also at 12:09 he refers to gauntlets as 'greaves' so bonus points there.\n\nAt about 12:10 he describes O-Yoroi as \"light\" although [this source](https://myarmoury.com/feature_jpn_armour.php) refers to it as \"heavy\", \"box-like\", and \"unsuitable for foot combat\".\n\n~~At about 12:50 he says about close combat \"once [the samurai] got equipped with katanas they were fine\" but [samurai in O-Yoroi armor would also have carried katanas](http://www.yurukaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/O-yoroi-the-early-Japanese-armor-of-samurai-class-of-feudal-Japan-17.jpg)~~\n\nu/ccmulligan points out:\n&gt;The samurai of the 11th century would've been in the Heian period. The swords they carried were not katana but tachi, a longer blade more suited to mounted combat.\n\nAt the end he concludes that the samurai would win because they have a bow and arrow and would just instantly kill the knight because it's not like arrows were a thing in Europe that knights were equipped to deal with.  Also some more stuff about samurai being super wealthy as opposed to knights who were, as we all know, just farmers who lucked out and found the best gear in a haystack.",

Nations refused.\n\n&gt; With no other solution to be had, a Final Solution was enacted.\n\n**R5:** There is absolutely no evidence that nations refused to take Jews in. Rather, most of the nations that were involved in the [Évian Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Évian_Conference) (which was set up at the behest of Franklin D. Roosevelt) had not come to an agreement - this is probably due to the anti-Semitic (not as much as the Nazis, but still significant) attitudes of these nations.\n\nHowever:\n\n&gt; The U.S. agreed that the German and Austrian immigration quota of 30,000 a year would be made available to Jewish refugees. In the three years 1938 to 1940 the US actually exceeded this quota by 10,000.\n\n&gt; During the same period Britain accepted almost the same number of German Jews. Australia agreed to take 15,000 over three years, with South Africa taking only those with close relatives already resident; Canada refused to make any commitment and only accepted a few refugees over this period.\n\nAs stated before, while most nations had not come to an agreement at the Évian Conference, they certainly did not refuse to take refugees and it is fallacious to assume that it led to the Final Solution.\n\n",

        "text": "You may or not be familiar with TED, or its *History VS* series, so I am going to briefly sum it up. In an animated courtroom, various historical figure \"stand trial\" and have to defend their actions and reputations to the court as the prosecution charges them with tyranny, genocide, murder, oppression etc and at the end it is left to the audience to weigh the evidence and reach a conclusion for themselves.\n\nI have a problem with this format because it introduces and strengthens the idea that History is like a court case with a clear verdict, right and wrong, guilt and innocence instead of the nuanced and complex narrative that it is. On the other hand, it *also* introduces people to the idea that history is not a rigid narrative but an open and changing one that is interacted with by historians even though the events in question have already passed. It teaches people that the *interpretation* can mean as much or more as the information itself. \n\nWith that said, onto the actual 4 1/2 minute video in question, [History VS Cleopatra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6EhRwn4zkc) which came out the other day so I knew I had to do this.\n\n0:18 The prosecution describes Julius Caesar and Marc Antony as \"*two of Rome's finest generals*\" \n\nJulius Caesar? Sure, he could definitely be called one of Rome's finest, even *the* finest, but Marc Antony? He has a spotty record at best, his campaigns in Parthia and Armenia were rather poorly handled and he lost the Final War of the Roman Republic which I honestly do not believe was a lost cause to begin with. He had his successes to be sure, but he was not truly cut out for politics and his reputation and career suffered for it. Really though, ranking generals is kind of subjective so I leave that to everyone to decided for themselves.\n\n0:29 The defense says that Cleopatra ruled Egypt and brought about \"*22 years of stability and prosperity.*\"\n\nThis is a good point, and what he says about stabilizing the economy, improving quality of life and adeptly handling droughts and famines is all true but in counting those years of prosperity he makes a rather glaring mistake. He ignores the civil war with her brother and her subsequent exile, *and* he does not count the war with Rome. The timeline itself clearly runs from 51 BCE to 30 BCE so I am not missing anything here, he is counting from the death of her father to her own demise, but the civil war alone lasted for at least a year and the Final War of the Roman Republic lasted two years which need I say were neither stable or prosperous for anyone. A more accurate statement would have been \"*She made some good economic reforms and handled a famine for 3 years but then she got exiled and there was a civil war that she mostly lost until Julius Caesar intervened and then she had a good 14-15 years (not counting the relative discord throughout the Mediterranean following Caesar's assassination and then she supported a few disastrous campaigns of Marc Antony.) Other than that those years were great, and then she lost a costly war with Rome and Egypt got annexed...which uh, was less great.*\"\n\n0:48 \"*Cleopatra VII was the last of the Ptolemaic Dynasty*\"\n\n Caesarion sends his regards.\n\n2:15 The defense starts talking about Caesar's  calendar reforms, census and plans for a Library to rival that of Alexandria and the prosecution says \"*Yes, all very ambitious. Exactly what got him killed.*\" Um, what? He mostly got assassinated because of fears he was accruing too much power, it had nothing to do with *library* plans, there were concerns he was attempting to seize the powers of a king and hard feelings over the civil war. The entire situation was complicated and the various parties involved each had overlapping but distinct motives, but I am pretty sure it had nothing to do with a 365 day calendar (although it may have had something to do with a month named after him).\n\n3:34 The prosecution says \"*until Octavian had all of Rome turned against him.*\" Not too familiar with the premise of civil war, are we TedEd? Evidently not *all* of Rome because of the existence of all Antony's Roman supporters in the war.\n\n3:45 \"*It was the Roman's fear of a woman in power that brought about an end to the Republic.*\" No. *No*. *NO*. It was centuries of instability, corruption, expansion, the reforms of previous politicians such as Sulla, Marius, Pompey, Crassus and Julius Caesar combined with a rapidly evolving political landscape and need for a stronger centralized power that contributed to the fall of the Republic along with countless other factors. This kind of revisionism is the kind of thing that only invites *other* revisionists like RedPill and Stefan Molyneux to refute the idea that misogyny has played a role in informing perceptions of women in history *and* to deride the role that women have played in history and make it some negative thing.\n\nIt *is* true that being a woman did play a role in much of the Augustean propaganda against her and writers such as Lucan demonstrate this quite clearly by giving such epithets as the \"Whore of Canopus\" and \"Fury of the East\" but this is also accompanied by derogatory attitudes about Hellenism and Orientalism in general with authors also focusing on her decadence foreignness. A finger can also be pointed at  early historians such as Jacob Abbott who viewed her more harshly through the lens of their biases as well as information propagated and invented in our fiction, such as Shakespeare's *Antony &amp; Cleopatra*, G.B. Shaw's *Caesar &amp; Cleopatra* and HBO's *Rome*, but it is important to separate the factors that have impacted *historians and media* from the factors that actually precipitated war.\n\nFor one thing, the tensions between Antony and Octavian had been building from before the Liberator's War even began, and the Perusine War in 41 BCE saw armed conflict between the factions loyal to Antony and Octavian. Antony also granted Cleopatra and her children numerous honorifics and titles first at the Donations of Antioch in 36 BCE and then again at the Donations of Alexandria in 34 BCE to strengthen their alliance and to compensate her for supporting his military campaigns in Parthia and Armenia. In these he declared Caesarion the true son of Caesar and his lawful heir (an obvious insult to Octavian), naming Cleopatra \"Queen of Kings\" and Caesarion as \"King of Kings\" and recognizing the dominion of Cleopatra and her children over Egypt, Cyprus, Cyrene, Syria, Parthia, Media, Cilicia and Armenia, although the lands not already under the authority of Cleopatra were unconquered and to be acquired at an unspecified future date they retained symbolic importance and the scale, decadence, and grandiosity of the event served to further alienate the Roman Senate and populace. Beyond this, King Artavasdes II of Armenia (a Roman client-kingdom) and his family were captured and paraded through the streets in golden chains at the Donations of Alexandria and when he refused to prostrate himself before Cleopatra his head was removed and sent as a gift to his rival Artavasdes I.\n\nTo be honest, there were a lot of reasons why there was a war between Rome and Egypt and there had been petitions to annex Egypt ever since Ptolemy IX left it in his will to Rome, and there were a lot of reasons war might *not* have happened given Egypt's previous history as a client-kingdom of Rome but it did, and it was not due to misogyny but to the political and socio-cultural climate of the time.\n\nIn general this video did an OK job of debunking some Cleopatra bad history but it opened up a can of worms it did not quite know how to handle with maturity or integrity and glossed over some important aspects of Cleopatra's life. I also personally wish they addressed her having Arsinoe and possibly Ptolemy XIV killed as well but this video seemed specifically targeted at her reputation as a seductress which is fine I guess.",
