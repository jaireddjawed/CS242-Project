I noticed an unusually high amount of bandwidth usage reported by the VPN, and found with the opera task manager that this cached page seemed to be the source.  The bandwidth was maybe a few 100Mb over short amount of time.  I  am concerned that it may have been uploading my files.  There was no crypto, but there were a couple tax related files on the system (oops), so it is a concern.  Is this a legitimate concern?\n Are there other common reasons for a page to use unusually high bandwidth?",

It is generator ID 139. \n\nClearly the rule is getting triggered a lot and getting cut off by the threshold system to keep it from spamming me, so I would like to tune it, not just turn it off altogether. But to do that I need to see the alerts that are being withheld. So I want to temporarily raise the global threshold to allow myself to get flooded with alerts so I can start to filter them. \n\nI can't figure out how to do that. I assume there is a programed default in Snort because I'm not finding a setting that is enabled that deals with this. I tried to add my own filter in threshold.conf, I dropped the time from 60 seconds to one second and upped the count several times until I'm finally at 250. So I have this: \n\n    event_filter gen_id 139, sig_id 0, type limit, track by_src, count 250, seconds 1\n\nI'm still not getting the actual alerts, I can't see how I would have more than 250 a second, it's an office with less than 75 users. \n\nCan anyone offer some guidance here?

When I search google for tutorials, the top post involved an XP VM. And I just can’t help but think... why?\n\nWindows XP was released in 2001, and it’s been end-of-life since 2014. Windows 7 came out in 2009. And Windows 10 is getting pretty good adoption. I understand there are still many people using Windows XP, but the thing is... those people aren’t usually paying for penetration tests. Of course that doesn’t mean you’ll never see it on a pentest, but my point is that you *shouldn’t* need a pentester to tell you XP is bad to have on your network. So why are we training beginners on it? \n\nI know a ton of tutorials are out there that tell you to get an XP VM, and then exploit MS-08-067... but I would argue that you can learn what that’s teaching you in a better way. I’m not blaming those of you who are learning, I’m wondering why so many experienced people recommend this. \n\nAm I alone in thinking this? \n\nDoes anyone have any awesome tutorials that focus on more modern operating systems that should be recommended instead?\n\nDid you learn something really valuable by starting with XP? \n",

I'd like to live in the Mid-Atlantic, preferably around New York, Philadelphia, or DC. \n\nOver my 4 years of work experience after graduating with my B.S. in CS, I have varying levels of experience as a project engineer doing red teaming, hardware and software reverse engineering, digital forensics, and tool development. \n\nOutside of using the military pay scales to predict a similar income level in the private sector, I'm not sure what sort of salary I can expect to receive or should ask to receive. Obviously, the first part of this question will play a large role in if I decide to separate or not. As an O-3 with a retention bonus I'd be looking at about $100k - $125k in regular military compensation (depending on location) which is an estimate of civilian pay equivalency when factoring in military tax benefits, etc... \n\nI've reached out to a few companies about open positions I'd be interested in, and actually applied to one of them. I did get a call-back and had a phone interview which gives me a little confidence, but they aren't able to press forward with hiring actions (including salary negotiation) unless I have an established date of separation. \n\nIm writing this just to see what sort of compensation I could be looking at in the private sector. There will be a lot of factors that go into a decision to separate or not, but passing up a stable 6 figure salary is a risk that I'd like to mitigate as best I can in advance by seeing what is being offered by the other options.

Also, insight into how the different offices from the control owners to the CISO and CIO think about IT and security in their company.\n\nAs such, I've done some self studies and have already completed the Edx Linux course and have started some udemy courses on penetration testing. This has taught me more about the terminal commands that are used and I've been able to leverage that knowledge in the current testing I'm doing as some of the older applications I'm testing are based off of unix and the linux ITGC testing I can directly apply the self-study knowledge I've gained. \n\nI'd like to pivot into a more technical IT role as I do not see myself doing IT Audit long term (especially if I'm continually booked on IT SOX engagements).

        "text": "As the title says, I have run Intel’s SA-00086 tool, which reported my CPU (Core i7-870 @ 2.93GHz) is running Intel Management Engine Version 6.0.2.1194.\n\nIt’s an HP Pavillion Elite HPE-000 series, pretty old but still my most used machine. I’d hate to have to part with it. \n\nHP does not appear to be offering any firmware fix for my machine. In short, am I screwed?\n\nI could live with physical access vulnerabilities, but apparently remote exploitation is also possible. Any help is greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "I see many companies moving away from passwords/pins and moving towards biometrics (fingerprint scanners, iris scanners, face ID, etc) to keep data secure. But what happens when those methods become easily exploited? \n\nThe great thing about passwords is that you can change then and increase their complexity to make it near impossible to crack without a lot of time, effort, and computing power. \n\nVisit Disney and they'll already have a photo and fingerprint of you, simply to access the park. Universal Studios has fingerprint readers, too. The same methods we use to unlock our phones are being used at amusement parks, airports, and soon just about everywhere. \n\nBut a fingerprint is easy to fool and can't be changed. Face ID will also eventually be exploited.\n\nSo what will we do when that happens and biometrics becomes the least secure method for device/account security? \n\n",

        "text": "Looking at old pentest reports of X client, I saw a specific vulnerability that was exploited on server Y and left unpatched. The vulnerability was in a web-server in their DMZ. So today I met with their sysadmins for another reason and we tried playing around in their network as we had some free time. I could not get a connection from the DMZ to the internal network though a remote exploitation is possible. X av is blocking me if I try any exploits even though that was not the case for a remote exploitation cause even meterpreter works. Spoofing is not possible either as I tried  with no luck. How would you go on attacking this network. The question stuck on my mind is \"what could work for this specific scenario.\", bypassing the specific X av is possible, but what about stealthy laderal movement. How could I pass from DMZ to the intranet, phishing using their own servers sounds like a good solution but I feel like I am missing something.",
