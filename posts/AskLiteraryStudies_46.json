In the fall (my final semester in my bachelors), I'm doing an Independent Study on Derrida - that's as detailed as my plan is right now (the only other thing I know for sure is that I will be producing some sort of paper). I am: a) hoping to focus on some of his more recent work, and b) hoping not to get bogged down with difficulties that have already been solved. Therefore, I was hoping to educate myself on the very recent discourse surrounding Derrida. \n\nHow is he being discussed and applied at the moment? I'm not particularly interested in writing a paper about Derrida and literature (as I like to put Derrida and philosophy in one box and literature in another), so criticism on Derrida the ~~philosopher~~ would be the most pertinent to my forthcoming project. My general plan is to spend the summer reading as much of his work and the surrounding criticism as I can to form a good base as well as a good question to address in the fall.\n\nThanks for reading!",

The book, or rather one chapter of the book, was very infuential in the late-Victorian proto-Zionist movement. I would like to submit it to an academic journal, preferably peer-reviewed. I am a PhD candidate in the field of English literature, but I have been advised by someone whose opinion I respect that this paper might sit better in a history journal rather than a literature journal. I am unsure. I am aware of half-a-dozen or so literary journals in the field of 19C literature, but I am not sure which would be the best to approach. I also think there may be other journals that I haven't thought of. Since I may have to commit for 4-6 months (or longer) I would like to make the right decision. Advice greatly appreciated.\nHere is the abstract: *This essay explores one very significant but for the most part forgotten milestone in the history of Zionism: the publication in 1876 of George Eliot’s Daniel Deronda and the nearly simultaneous publication of one section of the novel, nicknamed The Club Scene, that was widely disseminated in numerous periodicals throughout Europe. The Club Scene, informed by Charles Darwin’s recent publications as well as a much older tradition of racial theory, was a fictional depiction of a meeting of ‘The Philosopher’s Club” whose characters, particularly Mordecai, a Jewish mystic, suggested an intriguing new way of looking at the relationship between Christians and European Jews. It suggested a much more secular connection than had been widely envisioned before, downplaying religion as a sole motivating force for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in the east, and putting forward a joint restoration project that emphasized kindred races rather than kindred religions.*",

So far I've just been calling her a 'negative character', but I feel that there must be a better word for it. I know that antagonist is the 'enemy' of the protagonist and that antihero is an evil protagonist, but neither of these seem to fit Lady Macbeth, because she is not the enemy nor is she the protagonist. So is there some word to describe Lady Macbeth as a character? Or is it possible to just call her a negative character?",

I'm doing \"Macbeth\" in my high school literature class and in my essay I am expected to be able to show an understanding of stylistic features (on a level sufficient for a high school student of course, no university stuff :D).\n\nMy issue is that I've got a little confused about the words theme, motif and symbol. In most instances, I can see which is which, for example in \"Macbeth\" blood is obviously a symbol, violence is a motif and the danger of excessive pride and greed (I believe this is called 'hubris') is a theme. However, there are cases which confuse me. For example is the weather a symbol or a motif in \"Macbeth\"? And is deception a theme or a motif? Or is it that appearance vs. reality is the theme, but deception is a motif that reinforces the theme of appearance vs. reality? Or is it so that these concepts don't have a clear definition and to an extent you can use them in the way that you want to?",

        "text": "The reason I'm asking here and not simply copying and pasting wikipedia is the article seems rather piecewise, scattered, and of course, sources. At least here with you guys there's a credence.\n\nThe umbrella query is this: is there a world mythic canon? What goes in and what goes out, and why?\n\nI understand that \"myth\" and \"epic\" are potentially umbrella terms that can lead to diverse interpretation, and that's partly why I would like this post to be here. What makes a piece of literature mythic, anyway? Is it simply mythic structure and archetype? \"Epic\" as I understand has conventions - it's a genre - but with myth we could have anything from Gilgamesh to The Prose Edda to Medea when it comes to the diversity of culture, theme, and discourse.\n\nWhat irks me is how potentially fragmented myth is. Is there a nice handy source that everyone drew from, or is it just here and there with plays? Is the play Medea really myth, and why would a play be considered myth in the first place?\n\nI mean, how did the poets get their knowledge of classical myth, anyway? Surely their education, if the myth were in the plays, could have been fragmented if they simply didn't read all of them, as opposed to having them all in a common source?\n\nWhere would I go to read the myths of humanity?\n\nPart of this post is to bring the works together as complete as possible. To my understanding, the \"safe\" works - works undeniably classed as myth and/or epic, are as follows:\n\n**Greco-Roman**\n\n* The Iliad\n* The Odyssey\n* The Aeneid\n* Metamorphoses\n\n**Hebrew**\n\n* The Pentateuch\n\n**Mesopotamian**\n\n* Gilgamesh\n\n**Asian**\n\n* Ramayana\n* Mahabharata\n\n**Anglo-Saxon**\n\n* Beowulf\n\n**Irish**\n\n* The Taín\n\n**Scandinavian**\n\n* The Prose Edda\n* The Poetic Edda\n\n**Italian**\n\n* The Divine Comedy\n\n**English**\n\n* Paradise Lost (and Regained)\n\nFrom this list, would a play such as Medea fit, and why, being as it is, a solitary (and rather small) source?",

S. Eliot, ‘Tradition and the Individual Talent’). Examine Eliot’s poetic practise in the light of this observation.'\n\nI really want to get to grips with Eliot's poetic practise in light of this quote. So far, I think this conception of the poet manifests itself primarily through Eliot's extensive allusions. I think this will form a great chunk of my argument - that Eliot uses allusions to works to highlight some kind of underlying simultaneity across literature, perhaps to signify something lost in modernity, other times to highlight continuity. (by this point though, I'm already confusing myself)\n\nI also think his conception of the poet manifests through form, and dramatic monologues from voices and personae like Prufrock rather than Eliot himself. I'm also thinking I can perhaps view some of this through the lens of Freud's theory of 'the uncanny' (eg the uncanny doubling of London the 'Unreal city' via allusions to other cities across time in literature, thereby highlighting some kind of continuity.).\n\nBasically, I'm having trouble formulating this into a overarching slant on his poetic practise. The best I've been able to come up with so far is something like: Eliot's poetic practise alienates the reader, and highlights the spiritual malaise of modernity. But I fear this is too vague/trite.\n\nI've been reading criticism for the past few days, and it seems the more I read, the less I know. I feel especially defeated in trying to answer the question today, so apologies for poor writing/phraseology \n\nAny thoughts would very much be appreciated!\n\n",

By focusing on the relation between signifier and signified, he gained insight into linguistic structure yet eliminated the world. \"Bracketing the referent\"- that is, leaving out the third dimension of the sign, that to which it refers, has been criticized by those, like Terry Eagleton, who find it impossible to speak of language without speaking of reference, things, history. After all, they argue, language is not chess. How can it be studied apart from the world to which it refers? How can reference not have a role in structure? In addition, language is neither unified nor closed, as deconstructors and poststructuralists were quick to point out.\n\nI am trying to understand this paragraph and questioning how semiotics eliminate reference. To me, it sounds like  Saussure is being criticized for \"leaving out the third dimension of the sign\". But I don't see how reference is the third dimension. I feel that reference, which is the object that is being referred to, is the same thing as, signified, the thing that is being signified. What is the difference?\n\n",

I am posting this in the hope of starting a lively discussion and am also, of course, hoping you could provide some interesting insights, articles, journals, and examples that are relevant to my research.\n\nI found an interesting article that deals with this problematic:\n\nhttp://tropicsofmeta.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/911-and-its-aftermath-in-hip-hop-culture-the-hip-hop-critique-of-911-and-the-bush-administration/[1]\n\nHere the author describes how artists, such as Immortal Technique, seem deal with 9/11 along lines of political/sociological criticism. This seems to be in line with Hip Hop music's function as counter culture, as a way to give voice to disenfranchised Americans.\nIt is interesting, because I first tried to look for responses more in line with the mainstream response to 9/11, that of a national trauma which everyone is affected by. However Hip Hop music presents a counter-narrative of sorts. Instead of joining in with the national mourning and jingoism, they distance themselves and call attention to the fact that, despite the horrific nature of the attacks, we must not forget America's role in creating a political climate which made these attacks possible in the first place.\n\nI was wondering what you thought of this? Does Hip Hop have a long tradition of providing counter-narratives to mainstream interpretations of important events? Are there other voices in the hip hop community? And finally, do think of any songs or albums that seem to be strongly influenced by the events of 9/11 or deals with it thematically? Like how in literature Don Delillo writes about the effects of 9/11 on regular people in Falling Man or Cormac McCarthy (by way of allegory) in The Road?\n\nedit for this subreddit: In particular I am trying to place Hip Hop music in a a larger discussion about the narrativization of 9/11 in various forms of discourse. Academics such as Lucy Bond have talked about how there seems to be a grand narrative in academic and literary circles which is very uncritical about post-9/11 discourse in, for example politics, which has the danger of citizens unconditionally accepting this narrative and the consequences (with regard to foreign policy) it entails. \n\nAlso, do any of you know of academic work that has been done on Hip Hop, both as a movement and as music? (Even if it does not directly relate to 9/11)",

I'd like to discuss whether or not you think I'm on the right track.\n\nThanks!\n\n**referential (context):** “Kinky” is a poem about Barbie dolls, which have been around since 1959, so it refers to contemporary, suburban America.\n\n**expressive (addresser):** The poem's addressee—who seems to be external and unrelated to the subjects of the poem (two Barbie dolls in a relationship, and their sex therapist), as if observing them from a bird's eye view—emotively expresses the two dolls' adventurous sense of desire for change, to live vicariously through each other, a sense of curiosity to see the world from a different point of view, soul-searching contemplation and reflection [perhaps of one's own sexuality], intimacy and of love.\n\n**conative (addressee):** The poem's purpose displays a mutual and shared agreement between Barbie and Ken to explore each others' bodies, quite literally, by exchanging their heads, and to fully discover each other, perhaps to explore their sexual gender roles and to let their imaginations roam.\n\n**phatic (contact):** The addresser is chronicling a story to an audience about the relationship between two “individuals,” almost in a manner of gossip, chattering about their personal and private affairs. The addresser establishes contact by revealing to the audience in figurative detail about how each doll in the relationship actually feels about one another, perhaps even about him or herself (their genders are never revealed), as if the addresser is in their heads, somewhat omnipotently.\n\n**metalingual (code):** The message is reached through the medium of poetry, a literary sub-code in the English language.\n\n**poetic (message):** The poetic message of the poem, of wanting to literally exchange heads and be in the other's body, is created through creative metaphors such as “Ken wants to feel Barbie's toes between his lips, / take off one of her legs and force his whole arm inside her,” or how “suddenly Barbie is excited looking at her own body / under the weight of Ken's face.” As they question the nature of their relationship after an argument, a glimmer of hope is evoked when their sexual therapist tells them: “When all else fails, / just hold each other”; and their sense of desire and imagination is exemplified through their journey of sexual and self- discovery, like when “they let themselves go—Soon Barbie was begging Ken / to try on her spandex miniskirt. She showed him how / to pivot as thought he was on a runway. Ken begged / to tie Barbie onto his yellow surfboard and spin her / on the kitchen table until she grew dizzy.”",

        "text": "I don't know if you guys read slate.com at all, but I do every now and then. They're doing a series in their culture section on \"camp\" right now, and it got me interested because, before reading Sontag's essay, I thought that most recent cultural objects were \"campy\" in some way or another, but not according to Sontag. In her sense, I was confusing camp with irony. I am not (or I try not to be) a fan of irony after reading DFW's \"E Unibus Pluram.\" This distinction is interesting to me in the extreme. I've never had a vocabulary to separate these things before, but I've always emotionally sensed it in art.\n\nSo, I have some questions, any or all of which I'd like to get some feedback for:\n\n1. Camp: is it an artistic device itself, or is it a result of artistic devices coming together to make something campy? I don't know why I'm asking this question, however because Sontag says that camp is unintentional, but in another item on the list she says \"[t]he whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious.\" However, how can something have an artistic point in creating this aesthetic \"sensibility\" when \"[t]he pure examples of Camp are unintentional\"? Right now I'm seeing this as a flaw in Sontag's logic, which is maybe due to the list structure of \"Notes on Camp,\" but if someone could explain this for me that would be great.\n\n2. This question bounces off the last question kind of: Can literature be campy in Sontag's sense really? What would make a text campy? Does any work exist in the field using this terminology? \n\n3. In a lot of \"intellectual histories\" of criticism I've read, I see Sontag read as influenced by Barthes a lot. While I'm not too well read in Barthes, I have read *S/Z*. How do you see \"Notes on Camp\" responding to anything Barthes said?\n\nOther points about this essay that you have are welcome as well. Again, I find this to be an extremely interesting topic in literary/cultural studies and am interested about what kind of assertions could be made about a work of art inside of this lexicon.",

I don't have any great source material for this, and need to know where to look.  As far as how Lit goes about Phil, I think I have that.  But what it requires sort of deviates from philosophical discourse and meanders into literary analysis.  Any pointers?

In that the simulacra of real-human experience and relationships has effectively been removed by multicultural globalization, capitalism and materialism. In this way both internal contradiction (gratification and exploitation experience through sex/commodity of sex amongst others) and external resistance (personified both by the objectification of the characters, and the descriptions of the passing of time/ the seasons)\n\nMy questions simply begin with: is this a good idea? I think it is quite a valid point to argue, but perhaps too ambitious? Should I limit myself to one theorist, or two? The two that I am planning on using most are Baudrillard and Jameson, and the others are simply to highlight or underline my thesis statement (which still needs to be properly thought out).\n\nIf it is a good idea, or any revision is necessary, are there any good references you could point me towards. I'm currently using Simulacra + Simulation, History of Sexuality Pt 1 (The Will to Knowledge)  along with the primary text. If there is anything beneficial that I should I would be very grateful if you let me know.\n\nI've read The Precession of Simulation by Baudrillard, so his ideas on Simulation have only extended as far as war and the laud family. Looking for his own views of globalizaton, multiculturalism and sex - a nudge in the right direction would be adored.\n\nFeel free to shoot me down and make me question my essay. I'm struggling to define a thesis statement and hoping that through this post I can make one.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nP.S This is an 1st year undergrad lit essay so I can be adventurous.\n",

I was trying to understand how they got to this definition and asked for what elements that they determined what Literature was, and made the argument that several books such as SH and Harry Potter would fit in the definition that they gave. To me it seemed like the ideas of Literature that wanted to censor Ginsburg's poetry were there in the classroom.",

Is it that the language of Greek Tragedy come close to music, adopting some of its characteristics, which in turn enhance the language itself? Was Greek Tragedy originally sung all the way through, and we just lost the accompanying music that enhances the language? Or is it that only the chorus sings to set the mood of the rest of the spoken language, and keeping the mood of the chorus in mind, the action and language of the play is enhanced...\n\nMaybe I missed something somewhere.

        "text": "I originally posted this over in /r/askphilosophy and was pointed in this direction. Any help in understanding would be appreciated!\n\nI've been reading Sartre's What is Literature and want to clear up my understanding of his ideas about engaged literature. This may be quite long so I apologise in advance.\n\nMy understanding so far is that he believes other forms of art cannot be engaged in the same way literature can. He states that engaged writers use words as signs, and that prose writers use words in this way whereas poetry writers do not. As far as I can tell he believes poetry to be art for art's sake, and for him art for art's sake lacks any real meaning, purpose or merit.\n\nIt appears to me that literature, for Sartre, should and is always committed. He states that as soon as the writer engages in writing she is committed, and that it does not matter about skill. But what is this commitment? To whom and to what is she committed?\n\nTo me it seems that the engaged writer is committed to more than himself, as Sartre states the writer cannot write for themselves. He claims that reading involves some manner of prediction and anticipation, which the writer cannot get from her own work. He discusses a relationship between the author and the reader, claiming that writing and reading are entirely linked. He discusses how a writer must engage the freedom of the reader in order to get his point across, and because of this the writer is influenced as much by his reader as them by him. This seems to lead to his idea about 'good' novels actively engaging the reader about a subject, whereas a 'bad' novel seems to encroach on the readers freedom. And here he discusses the 'bad' novel being written in bad faith and states that an Anti-Semitic novel cannot be a good novel for it seeks to damage the freedom of the reader.\n\nIt seems that the engaged writer writes in order to bring about change. He brings attention to issues with the words he uses, and at the same time brings no attention to other issues using the same words.\n\nSo for me, it seems that Sartre believes that committed or engaged literature must have some kind of ethical or moral purpose, that it must engage the reader and seek to enlighten them in some way whilst still remaining accessible. It seems to me that Sartre believed committed or engaged literature to have some political agenda, that it should try to change something without just being propaganda. I believe, from what I've read, that Sartre believed writers had some responsibility to change the world of their time, to enlighten others about issues and struggles.\n\nWhat I don't understand is that Sartre seems to claim that ALL literature is committed/engaged, but I don't really understand how that is, though I may have misunderstood.\n\nSo am I along the right track? I found the text to be fairly confusing at time and haven't managed to find a wealth of literature discussing these issues directly. If anyone has any comments or links to resources regarding the subject I'd be very interested! Thanks.",

I am trying to do more research on the trope but am having difficulty finding any academic materials to supplement my thesis. More so, I am torn between whether she is a one dimensional character or if she has more depth. Specifically, because unlike the MPDG, the reader is aware of her social milieu and the psychological repercussions of having an alcoholic father and disinterested mother, furthermore the emotional experience of having and abandoning your child. Also, the appendix that reveals her in the end to be the mistress to a Nazi. It seems these plot-oriented details may be significant enough to show Caddy has more depth then the MPDG in modern cinema.\n\nI'm not sure if I am grasping at straw here, and was hoping someone could confirm or assist me in my thesis!\n\nThank you.",

I am preferably looking for a book that will deal with either the history of biological warfare during the cold war period or literary representations. If anyone could help that would be great!",

        "text": "Have an essay question for a highly complicated literature course I'm doing. I have been asked to the compare and contrast the following quote from Auerbach's work with that of Plato in his *Republic* or Aristotle in *Poetics.*\nThe quote is:\n\n *“Imitation of reality is imitation of the sensory experience of life on earth – among the most essential characteristics of which would seem to be its possessing a history, its changing and developing. Whatever degree of freedom the imitating artist may be granted in his work, he cannot be allowed to deprive reality of this characteristic, which is its very essence.”*\n\nI just need somewhere to start. I am struggling immensely with picking apart this quote and finding something within Aristotle or Plato to talk about specifically.\nAny help anyone can offer would be HUGELY appreciated.",
