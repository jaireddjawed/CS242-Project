        "text": "Asking this as a curious Aussie as supermarket coupons don‚Äôt really exist here. Some brands if they have a new product will do an online cashback but you have to prove you bought the item with the receipt. I quite enjoy watching Extreme Couponing, but I assume people like that are the minority in coupon use. My mum and I can‚Äôt believe that manufacturers and supermarkets in the US would allow coupons that double or mix with other offers to make items like 50 cents or free, since that‚Äôs not making them profit. They would NEVER do that in Australia.\n\nOn the other hand, the supermarket rewards programs are popular in Australia and if you work them right you can bank a lot of Flybuys dollars to use on future grocery shops. They even encourage banking your rewards dollars to use at Christmas time. And the ‚Äòspecials‚Äô in the major supermarkets follow an 8-12 week cycle - so if you bought your brand of deodorant on half price today, it‚Äôll probably be half price again in a couple of months.\n\nBut anyways, the crux of my question is: how often do you use coupons, and how much do you generally save? And are you taking home 80 boxes of ibuprofen with coupons for free, or is that BS?",

One of the things we do is split off half of it pack into Masson jars and vacuum seal before going into freezer for later date meals and emergency meals.\n\n- One of my cheap side uses for this is to take a can of black beans or equivalent dry black beans. Said beans go into a pot and get half an onion chopped, garlic clove minced, a bay leaf, and 1stp of Cajun spice (if you got spice rack don‚Äôt buy just blend yourself). If using canned beans this gets 3/4 of a cup of water also. This gets simmered on low for 2 hours. When we‚Äôre about 30 minutes out from dinner 1.5 cup of frozen gumbo gets tossed into the black bean boil. Make two Quesadillas on the stove. If you have smoked frozen pulled pork in the freezer ad 1/4 cup of that the black bean soup you got going. Make some Pico de gallo (diced tomato, diced red onion, cilantro, little lemon/lime juice or vinegar with a dash of salt and pepper, half small avocado chopped) use this to garnish ontop the quesadillas. This feed 4 people. If you want more of the southern flavor in your bowl splash a little crystal red hot. If you want leftovers double ‚Äúbean soup dish thing‚Äù",

Not sure of ownership..) recently had puppies, and when she's not in the room with them, she likes to poke her head in there to see if they're ok\n\n* Mini fridge- [Similar to #1 on this list](https://www.foodnetwork.com/how-to/packages/shopping/product-reviews/best-mini-fridge). Freezer part needs defrosting, but I'm having problems being able to unplug it\n\n* Phone charging/hairdryer- I rarely have both in use at the same time\n\nI have a heater, but it doesn't work well unless you are up close and personal with it. The three dogs besides the new mama snuggle with me and share a blanket, mama has blankets for her and her babies. I'm fine putting on extra layers- the temperature has barely gone below freezing since the temp was in the single digits.",

        "text": "So a little hack is to use a pot bigger then your smallest burner. This helps to trap a little more heat to the pan before it goes up around the pan and then lost to the room. Additionally if your cooking something for a long period of time use a heavy/thick pot like A Le Creuset pot as it will retain more heat do to thermal mass. One example if I‚Äôm doing chicken stock from all my frozen chicken carcasses I‚Äôm going to get my biggest and thickest pot. I will put on the smallest burner on the lowest or just up from lowest setting and fill pot with what not. In this configuration I can run a pot that‚Äôs 2-3‚Äù over the burner on all sides yet on the lowest setting.\n\n- Additionally if you have an electric stove you can  use pot coozies to help retain heat and run at a lower setting or rerun more her when doing something like a stock.",

So winter junk would be thrown up into the engine area for months and it would cost me whenever the body shops could get to it. Instead I ordered the part online for $50 at ebay and got the local auto repair shop to install it. If I had a lift I could have done it myself, but was happy to pay the $62 for the auto guy to do it. So saved hundreds, didn't have to drive it for months without it being fixed. There was no other damage to the car, just the liner torn off. Sometimes you have to think outside the box to get things done :)",

        "text": "We currently live outside St Louis, MO in Illinois. I like our community, but after our kids are out of the house (both teens now), I don't think I'd care to stay until retirement. Husband and I are both 40 and I think I'd like to move in 5-10 years. The taxes are a huge factor in my decision and the idea of paying $5000+/year in property taxes in retirement is just horrific. We were also \"staying for the parents\" but one set has indicated they'd love to move to Texas and the other will \"go where we go\" so aging parents is also no longer an anchor. If all goes well both of our jobs should be remote soon and choosing a location should be pretty flexible. It must be in the CONUS.\n\nThe issue is, I don't know where to even consider. Husband's roots are here and that's all he knows. I don't have a lot of experience living in many other states either except for ones that are expensive, have horrible winters, or both. I recently visted a friend in the Charleston, SC area and liked it, but vacation viewpoints don't always match reality. \n\nLiving in St Louis is a mixed bag, but I will say it has some things going for it: access to multiple sports teams, most national tours/concerts/events seem to come through here, a great playhouse and symphony, lots of free/low cost museums, etc and a really decent food/beer scene. I really like these features and am disappointed to probably lose them. The downsides are the bum weather, crime and taxes. I'm not a fan of winter, but am willing to live somewhere with winters equal to, but not worse than here.\n\nAny magical unicorn places out there that give me cool things to do, not awful weather and a reasonable cost of living? I'd like to be able to buy a home wherever we end up. We currently have a 2000sqft home and paid $226k and I think I'd like to find comparable, if possible. We are willing to  downsize or spend a bit more because our income has increased since buying and I also expect this house to retain its value and to be easy to resell later. Not shelling out $500+/month in taxes frees up more for a house payment. \n\nTLDR: Afforable places to live in the US that don't have nasty winters or are just middle of nowhere boring?",
