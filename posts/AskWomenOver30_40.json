        "text": "I tried posting this in financial-related subs but my post was deleted with MODs telling me I should post in relationship subs. I do not want a divorce though... just financial advice \n\nAs the title says, my husband is the big spender in our household and I feel like I need to protect my kid's financial future.\n\n**For background**:  he comes from poverty and he feels like now that he earns a lot more(~$95K) he should have whatever he dreamt of. when we met, he was still a student so I was supporting him and my kids (from previous relationship). I do not come from poverty so let's say I contributed to him getting used to nice stuff before he could afford anything. I started noticing his spending habits early but it wasn't too bad.\n\nThe thing is that, our family is growing as well as our household spending. What annoys me is that I still have to be the one planning for every little... he does not feel the responsibility of finances plus his family is still poor and relying a lot on him.\n\nI got to a point where now all I require from him is pay the mortgage and I handle everything else... Honestly I'm at peace with this except that We've been talking about investing in a rental property or something. The more I think about it the more I feel like I don't want to be the one paying for it while he just benefits and finds more ways to spend.\n\n** So here is my question: I earn about $ 200K and want to invest more for my kids. my current strategy is to max out my 401K, open up 529 for each kid (I only have 1 account as of today), and maybe have a will or trust** \\- **Not really sure how to proceed so any help would be appreciated.**\n\nThank you so much for reading",

So I’m 33F and had been single and celibate by choice for a year and a half. I did the work on myself etc. and felt like I was in a great space. Im literally minding my own business when the guy who delivers my treadmill asks me out. Things started off strong with communication. Then quickly it’s clear that was a front he can’t keep up. I try to say I’m not interested but he talks his way back in. Fast forward a week, and we hook up because I decide that I’m 33 and have needs and can be casual because he isn’t relationship material for me and it was amazing. But then I start to care. Wonder why he’s radio silent etc. That was 4 days ago and I just realize it’s not emotionally healthy for me. It sucks and I feel like I’m having to relearn how to be alone and talking to no one which I was happily doing for over a year and a half. To be clear, we only talked for a month which I know is nothing at all. Im just saying I’m finding it hard to just go back to being happily single or alone (even though I know I wasn’t in a relationship with this guy, it’s just a term).  Any advice or just pep talks welcome! Because I know I’ll get over it. But just nice to commiserate with other ladies.",

        "text": "Hi all. I’ve (36F) been casually dating this guy (35M) for a few months now (since before thanksgiving). \n\nThis is one of those situations where we have really gotten close and it feels like a relationship. However, I’m struggling bc I’m trying to hold parts of myself back that I feel would make me fall for him (such as physical intimacy outside of sex, like hand holding, hugging, etc). We chose to date casually bc he explicitly said he doesn’t want a relationship right now. He is about a year out from a 5-6 year relationship that was unhealthy, and he’s said he’s not over it still. He doesn’t bring his ex up often but he will sometimes (for example, “my ex and I went here and it makes me sad to be here” or “my ex and I traveled to this country and I don’t want to ever travel there again” etc.) He really associates a lot of places and things with his ex. \n\nI understand him wanting to be single so he can find himself and just live his life and improve. He’s in therapy but tbh I don’t know how well it’s going if he’s still struggling this much with not being over his ex. \n\nI’m starting to feel a little foolish I guess. We’ve seriously got a good thing going, and we both are very close and have a deep connection. Bu yet I feel sad and like I’m misguiding myself here. I feel like I’m waiting around for something that won’t happen bc he’s not ready. I guess it’s hard for me bc he REALLY pays attention to me, values what I have to say, and I haven’t experienced that from a guy in god knows how long. He hits a lot of things I look for in a partner. \n\nHe told me this last weekend he hasn’t been seeing anyone else, no dates, etc. I haven’t either. But yet he still seems conflicted over being single. \n\nAm I wasting my time at this point? I’ve been distant all week with him, which isn’t saying a lot bc we don’t text often lol. But I feel off now, and I don’t know if I can get back to the excited happy feelings I had. I’m just worried now that despite having a great time whenever whenever we’re together, that it’ll just be harder if I keep continuing it. \n\nHas anyone been in a similar situation? Would love some insight or advice…I’m a very nice person and the thought of throwing it all away is hard. Idk if I have any other choice though. I was thinking of talking to him and just telling him how I feel and see where it goes. And maybe say if he does ever decide he wants a relationship, to contact me.",

        "text": "My friend agreed to posting this to she’ll see the comments. When I was 20 I got pregnant. The father bailed and demanded an abortion. Through my pregnancy he was brutal. Constant threats and insults. He got a new gf and moved her into his house.When the baby came he still tormented me. He was extremely high conflict. My daughter developed severe anxiety around 2-4 years old and would violently vomit before her visits sobbing and begging not to go. I took her to therapy it didn’t help. At 4 she came home with severe bruising all over her bottom and legs. She was beat with a belt. It took 13 days for the bruises to heal. He lied, CPS got involved. Classified it as a non accidental injury and stated she would’ve had to be restrained. He wasn’t indicted bc a 4 year old isn’t a good witness. He lost visitation, never tried to get it back. Years later he terminated rights. We live in a very small town where everyone knows everyone. They started a smear campaign calling me a liar, white trash, and saying I was jealous. Calling me trash, my friends trash was his favorite insult. This all stressed me out so that it caused me to have a miscarriage a bit further along than most requiring medical intervention. Years have passed, my daughter is now 15. She has past trauma and anxiety but has grown into a really awesome young lady despite it all. Last year her father and step mom divorced. Since then, the stepmom, Kay, has started hanging out with my friend group. I have a 4 month baby so I haven’t been around socially. It bothered me a lot at first. She was pretty awful. I am working on letting the animosity go but it’s hard. I believe she was victimized by her husband. I believe she felt she had an obligation to support him. But it’s still hard to forgive and forget. So, for new years, my best friend Bee, her sister, and myself were making a plan. They chose to stay in an Airbnb an hour away. I wanted to go but didn’t feel good leaving the baby. Her sister is the one spending a lot of time with Kay. But Bee…Bee knows I’m struggling with this. She has been there since the beginning. She listens to me vent. She assures me that Kay is not replacing me. Imagine my frustration when Kay takes my place in the NY plans. Bee says she is just an ‘addition’. The thought of my friend being on an intimate night out with her makes me feel pretty low. They posted pictures all night. Bee called before she went and I said I wasn’t sure what she thought I was going to say and she knew how I felt. She said she had friend guilt. Afterwards, she texted and said she doesn’t care about Kay and barely hung out with her. She said she just wanted to celebrate the NY with her husband and sister. She said she is not sorry for going but is sorry she hurt me. I’m not saying I am going to end our nearly 20 year friendship over. She jeopardized it. But, maybe I am overreacting. Maybe I am being selfish. So, AITA for being angry or am I being too sensitive?",

He proclaimed them both to his, decided to take one “back home” with him and magnanimously leave me the other one. He says my mother took them from him 30 years prior. I didn’t know this. \n\nmy version: \n\nI allowed him even though I am a 40 year old independent woman who is not afraid of setting boundaries. i figured he was either right and they did belong to him or he was wrong and he would have to live with his own lie. \nHowever, due to circumstances and other peoples' reactions I’ve been doubting myself. i also saw a whole exhibition of this artist's work last weekend which made me realise again  how valuable these things are and I was a bit shocked once again by what happened.   \n\nMy father’s version: \n\nThe works of art were given to him when he first became a journalist and he interviewed the artist and was given the works by the artist. My father always immensely appreciated this gesture and was always very proud of the works of art. During his divorce with my mother, my mother took the works of art and never returned them and / or pretended not to have them. So for my father to finally see them hanging on my wall was a huge surprise and shock and that’s why he felt he could take one, as they were and are his. \n\nMy mother’s version:\n\nMy mother doesn’t really have a good explanation as to why she had these works of art in her possession. My guess is she felt entitled to take what she wanted as he cheated on her. \n\n\nMy partners feels what my father did was awful. I don’t know. \nAm I stupid? Do both my parents suck?",

        "text": " TW: physical harm \n\nI grew up in a 3rd world Asian country with too much poverty. My dad had a good job that paid well even by Western standards, and when he brought those $$ home, it converted nicely with a low cost of living while my mom stayed at home. My parents would always be like “look how better youre doing than the rest of the country”. They sent us to good schools, paid for college, etc. \n\nBut the discipline part was traumatic. I’ve been punched, kicked in the head, slapped in the face over trivial things. One time my dad was looking for something to blame because the door knob broke, and he just blamed me because i was the last one to use the bathroom. He bashed me with a broom stick leaving me with a purple leg for days. He also almost killed the dog for eating his stupid shoe. My dad would just “exist” at home. Didnt interact much with us, he always invited his male friends over where they get completely intoxicated in front of children. \n\nI was told these behaviours were okay because “we were sent to good schools”. \n\nI carried on with my life thinking this was normal. Until i met my husbands parents. Hoo boy. It was like peeling all the layers of abuse ive gone through. Not only his parents gave him all the “nice” things mine did, but they were both present, knew their kids well, and made sure they supported them with whatever sport / extra curricular / hobby they wanted to do. When i asked my mom if i can take swimming lessons, she said she didn’t want to take me to the school. Their problem at home was always logistics (nobody wanted to drive) so we just stayed at home.  \n\nThese realisation happened in the last 2 years. I’ve gone no contact because when i confronted my mom about it, she denied everything and completely downplayed my dad’s physical abusiveness, and the reason why he was doing those “simple slap on the wrist” is because he was “going through something”. Btw, my mom is emotionally abused by my dad but is constantly defending him.\n\nI feel like i’ve been robbed of a good childhood. I was only a kid once and yet my own parents ruined it. My husband never understands, he’s iffy to comment because he’s good friends with them, and doesnt have a grasp of bad parenting because he’s never had it. \n\nI feel so alone in feeling this way, can anyone share their experiences on how they've dealt with this? thanks all. :)",

        "text": "I have had a rocky relationship with my parents since I was a teenager. Nothing I had done just my mom is a narcissist is the simplest way to describe this. She manipulates me, guilt trips me, uses my siblings and dad against me, gaslights me and is overall very negative. I have tried for years to make it work. All I ever wanted was a close relationship with her. She’s super close with my 2 younger sisters but has always treated me as the black sheep and I’m not sure why. My dad doesn’t have a mind of his own and just blindly follows along like a zombie. Mh mom has turned my dad and sisters against me they all hate me and nothing is ever good enough doesn’t matter what I do. This all started last year at Christmas when she pulled a fit about something stupid and made it all about her like she always does then We started to drift after I talked to a therapist and was advised to no longer feed into her weird game of manipulation and to stop begging for scraps from them when I get nothing but currently we are basically no contact. and these are the events that lead up to this.\n\nMy parents often ignore my calls and texts \nAfter I stopped playing into their game I didn’t hear from them at all it’s like they have no desire to be apart of my life.\n\nMy SO and I had a wedding planned for in the fall I sent my parents and siblings a save the date like everybody else and never heard a reply. \n\nFebruary I found out I was pregnant of course the first person I wanted to tell was my mom \nI waited a while but finally sent a text more out of curtesy than anything telling them. I said “mom and dad I wanted to let you know that myself and my SO are expecting our first baby and we are very excited and I wanted to share with you.”\nmy dad replied saying that my grandpa was trying to get ahold of me for a Christmas card or something random. I asked him if he had seen the text I sent and he said “yup congrats” my mom never answered. I felt hurt beyond belief \n\nNext I sent a wedding invitation (this whole time I could t belief my mom was missing out and wanted no part in my wedding or pregnancy) my family didnt rsvp until midnight  of the last day to do so \n\nStill months went by didn’t hear from them at all (I still texted them for all birthdays and holidays just ti be nice) \n\nFast forward to days beofre my wedding I text them to ask where they would prefer to sit at my weddding which I think was nicer than I should have been or so everyone told me \n\nThe night beofre my wedding I get a text from my dad saying “we won’t be staying for the reception “ this is after I had already Stressed about seating arrangements, paid the caterer per seat and accommodated all their dietary restrictions. I know they purposely sent this text the night before my wedding to upset me, which it did. I had a tiny hope in my heart that they would stay at the reception and listen to the speeches from my friends and see me their daughter dancing and all the people that love and care about me and my husband and maybe realize they don’t want to miss out on me 😢 but whatever I dealt with it. \n\nThey did come to the ceremony so I tried to focus on that. The entire ceremony they cried like they were at a bloody funeral. They looked down at the ground and at their phones the whole ceremony, my dad was the only one who caught my eye for a moment. Then after the ceremony they left without so much as looking at me or saying hello. They missed out on all the family pictures and I didn’t get to have my parents in my wedding photos. I felt so embarrassed and sad I tried to ignore it for the rest of the night because it was supposed to be my day. They tried to get sympathy votes from everyone at the wedding, making it look like they were the poor sad saps, luckily not a single guest bought their act. And every single guest couldn’t believe what a show they put on. My friends and family were completely disgusted and ashamed of them. I had people asking me all night what was wrong with them. \n\nFor my wedding gift they got me a card that said “congrats, we have made a donation to sick kids in your name” which idk maybe I’m being selfish but it really rubbed me the wrong way especially with my baby on the way it just felt like not a very appropriate gift for a wedding? \n\nAfter the display at the wedding I uninvited them to my baby shower. I told them because of their behaviour at the wedding I didn’t think it was appropriate they come. Their response was to stop letting my husband control me?\n\nMy baby was born October 30th I got a text from my mom saying congrats and they dropped a gift for the baby at the door but honestly the gifts are obligation it’s so when people ask my mom can still look like the good guy. She can say she’s texted and dropped gifts for the baby and cry and get sympathy. \n\nThey dropped gifts off again at Christmas just outside the door in the snow. I never opened them. \n\nThey have done alot of awful things it’s hard to list all In one post id need to write a book. So just believe me on that, they never have pure intentions without some kinda malicious intent behind it. They have done this to me and so many friends and family and I just don’t understand it. Now being a mother myself I can’t imagine missing out on all these things with my child or treating my child this way. My baby is their first grandchild she has made them grandparents and they don’t care. It breaks my heart on a daily. They have missed out on so so much, things they will never get back it saddens me deeply. Could someone explain this behaviour  to me or how to deal with it. \n\n\nTL;DR\nNarcissistic mother misses my wedding reception and birth of my baby amongst other life milestones for what?",

        "text": "Would appreciate some advice, but am tentative to post as this is hard and I am struggling. \n\nPreface: I hold my spouse 100 percent accountable for their actions, their actions are their own. \n\nThis is long, I apologize. \n\nSpouse had an affair with physician who treated his mental health on deployment. It's a complicated situation. I hold him accountable, as a health care professional- also have some compassion.  This post is the relationship with my sister in law. \n\nI went to my sister in law when I noted  husband acting strange. I didn't recognize my spouse and he stopped speaking to me- something he's never done. She is very close with him and over the last several years I consider her a friend. \n\nI found out  a few days ago my sister in law who was my confidant  knew long before I did my spouse was engaging with someone else. She didn't know all the details or when it started, but she knew weeks before I even noticed a change my spouse was slipping notes under the physicians door, spending time with her while in port, they had \"shared feelings,\" physician was pursing him, and he was very infatuated. Healthcare wise, this relationship is a red flag- but again my spouse is responsible for his actions. \n\nSister in law  didn't condone or really condemn the behavior. She was a sounding board. Sometimes she entertained their relationship, sometimes she sung my praises- overall quite neutral. She did encourage him to speak to me, he lied to her and said I knew. However, she was also talking to me throughout all this and knew I was unaware. Or at the very least, pretending to be. Upon discovery she acted surprised, told me it wasn't in her brother's character to act in that way. I agreed. Overall, I thought she was wonderful (again, didn't know she knew). She told me she was supporting him- I was very thankful for this, but also SIL was a good friend to me. \n\nAs I've said, she never said anything to me about his affair. She let me talk, vent, asked questions, came over for dinner, dropped off her kid for me to take over night, etc.. My family commented allowing her kid to come over was odd, it was apparent I was in crisis- I thought I was hiding it well and she trusted me. \n\nI posted this situation a few days ago and got some great advice to approach with my feelings and allow explanation.  We were supposed to do an after holiday get together.  The night before our planned get together she texted a \"Got COVID, was supposed to see you, but covid.\" Relief. I didn't have to handle this. I had decided though she betrayed my trust, and while I understand why she wouldn't tell me, not the kind of friend I want. I left it alone though.\n\nThe day we were supposed to get together she texts my husband and I around 1 PM asking if we're home because her kid is in the area with her ex. My husband and I were having some really heavy talks as I had just found out few days earlier SIL knew as well as several other items. In short I texted back that I had read her text messages with my husband, by protecting its secrecy she gave approval, and she watched my mental health spiral. She wasn't a friend. \n\nI understand why she made the choice she did. I even respect it. Her brother was telling her I was someone who had been great, but I didn't make him happy any longer. I get it. truly. But the consequence of her choice is I recognize she doesn't care about my mental health. And that's not someone I wish to have as a friend. \n\nEssentially she doubled down and said she wasn't the marriage police and not involved. The long paragraphs and days and days  of texts between husband and SIL- she had a lot of opinions.  And she said a lot of great things to him.  She stated she understood my hurt, but would reach back out in a few days when I had time to cool. I explained I reached out to my therapist and I felt pretty comfortable with my decision. I said some angry things about my husband's behavior not directed at her in the least. I acknowledged she wasn't aware of those things. \n\nShe sent a string of texts, one about how her kid (16 year old w/ autism- she's fantastic, super smart great personality) was looking forward to seeing me today and I needed to \"think  up a few words because I was \"blowing her off\" and my niece was going to call me. My sister in law canceled at midnight the night prior. I told her not to manipulate me with my niece (their mother is a big manipulator,). \n\nI was upset and didn't want to talk to my niece when she called because I would cry. I sent a text I couldn't talk. But thought of a \"few words\" per SIL's request to explain why we weren't available and said \"We were supposed to get together today, but your mom got covid and canceled. I do need to talk to you about something though. I need you to understand I love and adore you first and foremost. Your Uncle did something over the summer and your mother knew about it long before I did. His actions impacted me and we're trying to work through them. I want you to know your mom did absolutely nothing wrong, but i have hurt feelings over not sharing some things. it doesn't impact my feelings towards you and not why we're not getting together today. Your mom said she had covid, so we made other plans. These are adult problems, but I wanted you to know you are loved and the best person I know. I can call later if you have time\" \n\nMy husband read what I wrote and said that's good. I talked to my niece later that night and we made plans for me to pick her up at her Dad's Sunday. We talked for about 30 minutes, I told her things were good. Nothing to worry about. We talked about the holidays, her school, cats, tarot cards- great conversation. No details about anything else and had she asked I would have made similar generalizations and supportive comments. \n\nMy sister in law texts me an hour later upset I said the above to her daughter. She questioned why I would cross that boundary. I thought  my explanation was age appropriate and honest- I was under the impression my niece was told or believed I was blowing her off per SIL's text. My niece is 16 and while she  has autism and some medical issues- my SIL treats her like any other kid and my niece is intelligent, well adjusted, etc.. \n\nSIL told me I was wrong. I said I gave what I thought was an age appropriate response to a request for an explanation, If you want, I can cancel Sunday. I endorsed respecting her judgement. SIL replied if you can't not tell her about adult problems I don't want you around her. I told her if her daughter has questions I will offer age appropriate answers.  I offered to take the blame for canceling, niece and her dad would never know SIL asked (SIL has a terrible relationship with ex). She told me to do that, I did. Told my niece I had to make an emergency trip to my mother's- told her Dad the same. Niece was disappointed. I apologized and felt terrible. I sent my SIL photo confirmation of my actions. \n\nSister in law then texts my husband how awful and inappropriate I am and is essentially telling him he shouldn't have to deal with me. She implied I shouldn't have read the texts. People will have opinions, but I want full disclosure so I can make informed decisions moving forward. She's trying to drive a wedge between us- but there's already a mountain there. I am figuring it out one day at a time.  My husband says he's fighting for us and he's making a serious effort- but I am emotionally exhausted. \n\nI am in marital crisis with my spouse trying to work through things. We've been working through this since October, but he was deployed up until two weeks ago. This is our first few weeks officially back together in the same place. My spouse is in a better mental space as well so we're discussing more details. I am finding out a lot, making decisions, and processing. He's in therapy, getting a lot of help, and coming to terms with some really terrible behavior.  He's not a bad person . Neither is SIL. \n\nAnd sister in law keeps texting us. I stopped answering. My husband needed to sleep- but said he would talk to her in the morning. \n\nTheir family is always chaos. \n\nI am a simple person for the most part and this level of dysfunction- it's not something I'm accustomed to and I am feeling incredibly uncomfortable. I am shocked I'm in this position.  I'm struggling tonight and I don't know what to do. I don't even know what I'm asking, just asking for others insight. I'm doing my best.",

        "text": "tldr; when did you move on from your first big heart break?what are the specific, tangible things you did to heal?\n\nHi all! I (F30) was in a situationship that ended badly (I’m embarrassed to admit) five years ago. It was my first big heartbreak - I was smitten basically from the minute we met, and he was the only person I’ve ever felt that intense bodily chemistry with (full body-tingling from a slight look, butterflies, etc.) \n\nBut, he had a tendancy to be cruel, flaky, and emotionally unavailable - would just shut down if I brought up certain things and was very off/on so I never knew if I was going to see him (basically meaning I was constantly in anxiety waiting for him to text). Around four months in we had the “talk” where he told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship but my young, naive 24 year old brain I didn’t really process this as it felt like we were already in a relationship (i.e. sleeping together exclusively). Anyways, I would try push for things that were too much for him and it got really ugly as he increasingly resented me. At the end he attacked me with a lot of cruel things (calling me a boring sexual conquest, comparing my body and genitals unfavorably to other women, telling me he’d actually been sleeping with other girls when we were together, etc.) I begged him to meet me one last time so we could end on a different note and he blocked me on all accounts and I never spoke to him again. To put it mildly, it absolutely wrecked me (literally could not eat for months and lost a bunch of weight) and for years after the smallest trigger of him would give me near full body panic attacks. \n\nIt’s been years and I’ve gone through a lot of self growth since then. I have a list of things I do which help:\n-keep a list on my phone of horrible things he said/did, so when i am tempted to romanticize it I look at it as a reminder that he is not someone I would want to partner with now\n-have a separate list of things I learned from the experience on my phone (i.e. now I know right from the start if there is a red flag like I’m anxious, it should be a dealbreaker or something to communicate about)\n-deleted our entire chat history so I can never again see the mean things he said\n\nI have done all the typical things (therapy, working out, pursing hobbies, blocking him on all social media) and otherwise feel really content with life - I am a student in a field I love, feel deeply committed to my work, have great, long-term friendships, etc.  I’ve travelled a lot, met many people since I knew him, and have dated casually. I’ve read basically every book on stuff like this (trauma, attachment theory, PTSD, break ups, romantic obsession, etc. etc.) and day to day I’m generally content with the big and small stuff. \n\nBUT all that said - there is this small part of me that just feels totally unable to get past this. Every time I meet a guy and I don’t get the shivers, I just feel like I lost some ineffable thing that will never be recreated. Over the summer I got notifications the ex was looking at our old chat history (this was before I deleted the threads because I didn’t realize he had unblocked me) and routinely looking at my LinkedIn. I hate that I felt a pang of validation for this and wish I was in the place of genuine just not caring about it. \n\nI’ve tried to reframe this in my mind as an experience to carry with you, that you never get over/past but instead is something that just informs how you live and hopefully in a way that leads to something better. But I worry that I’m shortchanging any potential partners/missing out on possible people to date because I feel so haunted by the memories of when it was good with him that no future experience will really compare (even though, logically, of course I know it was never actually all that good because of the way it ended! and that I’m probably mistaking “chemistry” for “anxiety” and if it was really going to work out, it would have worked out etc.). \n\nAny wise wisdom? what have you done to move on/live with the really big hurts?",

I don't have to interact with him on a day-to-day basis so there is little to no communication. But when I do see him, all the feelings come rushing back.\n\nA couple of months ago, I was brave and asked him out but he politely rejected me, saying he has a girlfriend, and for me, that was the end of the discussion and immediately did all of the above. I don't know his current relationship status but I recently attended a work happy hour (unwillingly, mind you) and this man just checked me out from head to toe. Two months ago, we were at a work volunteer event together (although I wanted to cancel because I wanted to set boundaries) but it was obvious that he was really attracted to me.\n\nHow do I get over this? I want to move on and am doing everything in my power but can't let these feelings slide.",

When I asked if it was an on-location type of job, he said yes, to which I replied, “that’s so far from everyone we know.” \n\nHe got a bit upset by my response and said we can talk about it at a later time (he was headed out to dinner with is parents).\n\nI can understand why he might’ve been upset because he’s been feeling burnt out about interviewing and job hunting. However, I do have some mixed feelings about this. I know that earlier on in our relationship, I said I would move to where he was, but I didn’t think that it might have to be all the way across the country. \n\nWhile I’m happy that he’s finding new opportunities, I don’t know how I feel about the possibility of moving across the country.

At the time I was a straight sized person that had suffered with so many fad diets, disordered eating, etc. A particular issue for me was binge and restrict cycles. \n\nSo when I heard about food and body freedom and intuitive eating I was obviously so excited! What do you mean there’s a way I can enjoy good and be healthy all at once??? And honestly it was really great in the beginning. \n\nI had a better relationship with my body and with food and my mental health was really improving. But it didn’t really solve all my issues. The restrictions were gone but the bingeing remained. I worked with an IE nutritionist for over a year. \n\nA few years later and I feel the least healthy I ever have and I’m starting to feel lied to. Like IE was sold as the cure to dieting. The solution to everything. But it was sold in a way that made it sounded like it wasn’t just another ‘magic pill’. It feels like you need a lot of privilege to be able to follow an IE lifestyle. \n\nSo I’d love to know: has anyone else had similar negative experiences with IE? Or am I just failing at it? But if you can fail at it, then it isn’t what it says it is?\n\nI’m well aware of the positive experiences of IE but all I see when someone criticises it or says it hasn’t worked for them is “you’re doing it wrong”",

        "text": "I've been wondering about this for a while. I used to be very quick to tears, but for years now (since my early to mid-twenties I think -- I'm 31 now), I've been virtually unable to cry, even when I'm really sad or going through something. Even when I was going through a horrible break-up two years back, I didn't cry once, though I felt absolutely miserable on the inside. The only two times I've been able to cry in the past two years were once when I was drunk, and once when I was in really bad physical pain due to a sports injury. Sometimes I feel like it would be such a relief to be able to cry &amp; I really yearn for that catharsis, so I listen to sad music, watch a sad movie, anything, but it never works. It's like I'm just physically unable to. I've heard of people having more difficulty crying because of antidepressants, but I don't take any medication and never have, so that can't be the reason.\n\nAnyone relate to this? And if so, do you have any thoughts on what causes this or what might help?",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI've (37F) been seeing a guy (38M) for about two months. The chemistry is great; I haven't felt butterflies like this since my early 20s. I actually was starting to wonder if there was something wrong with me. We have not had the \"define the relationship\" conversation because we talked early on about how we both have had some bad experiences being forced into relationships too early. We are both off the apps, though, and on the same page about not multi-dating. This is good for me right now. He is so caring (and he actually shows it). He makes me feel safe. He makes me laugh. This isn't a \"should I dump him\" post this is a \"please help me untangle some messy feelings I have\" post.\n\nThis is where those messy feelings start. I feel like he keeps having Things come up that deprioritize our time together. We live about 45 minutes apart and both have early mornings so we spend maybe one evening a week together. However we talk \\*constantly\\*. From morning until bedtime. \n\nFirst he got sick (not covid but he was REALLY sick). Then he was under the weather for a while after that. Then he had two out of town trips planned on back to back weekends (planned prior to us meeting.) Then he went down to his family's Christmas early due to incoming bad weather. Then because his sisters were in town he stayed there for two weeks, through New Years, to spend time with family. We had briefly talked about doing NYE together and he instead wanted to stay with his family, despite having been with them for a couple weeks already. I had time off work, and sort of assumed I'd be spending it with him, although it was my fault for not being more clear on that. I did say (nicely), \"hey, haven't you had enough of them?\" and he said, \"well my parents are getting older, who knows how many more times we'll all be together.\"  (They have a family trip in January and the whole family rallied around a wedding this past summer...) His fam is only about an hour and a half away, so I'm perplexed at the long stay.\n\nI have a good relationship with my immediate family but after about 12 hours I'm done. So this is baffling to me and kind of making me go hmmmm. HOWEVER, the last guy I dated seriously had REALLY weird family dynamics. His mother still bought his clothes, she came to stay with him for a MONTH in his one bedroom apartment and we couldn't do things that \"his mom wouldn't want to do.\" While at the same time he didn't talk to, or about, one of his sisters. So I'm feeling a little bit like my understanding of family dynamics in relationships is off. \n\nBack to my current fella'. Now his uncle died (he was in hospice). We have tickets for an event this weekend, and it sounds like he'll be back with family for a funeral, ruining our plans. Honestly, I'm a little resentful. And I feel so horrible. Someone \\*DIED\\*. A part of his family is gone! what kind of monster am I that I'm worried about our tickets? And yet it seems like this is another THING getting in the way. \n\nI'm just looking for help sorting through my feelings and responses. If someone I was dating for two months told me they were upset that I was prioritizing family and health over them, I'd tell them to get lost. I don't mean to frame it like that. However I am feeling a lot like I'm in a long distance relationship, which isn't what I signed up for. \n\nIs this just a guy with a healthy family relationship, the holidays, and cruel twists of fate combining to make for a difficult inaugural few months? Am I being unreasonable or completely selfish? Would love any feedback, from, \"yeah that sucks but it'll get better as you get more serious\" to \"you monster!\" to \"seems like he's not that into you\" (all thoughts that have been playing on loop in my head.) Thanks!\n\n\\[I'm using a throwaway account because the guy knows my primary account. I tried posting this on Dating Over 30 but they rejected it because despite being active with this throwaway account, it's not active enough, apparently. And the mods were pretty icky so. Blech! I like it here better anyway!\\]",

Whether we go to dinner, or to the mall, or to a party, or to a show, its almost always guaranteed she would comment on how she overheard people talking shit about her. I'm always around her or have other friends who are around her yet I never hear this. Also its extremely odd that she just has this \"luck\" that strangers just choose **her** to talk  shit about her within her earshot? \n\n\nAt first I kind of believed her but the stories got so constant that I felt it highly unlikely that she would be the random target so often. We went to a house party together recently and I had this on my mind. I literally made it a point to be around her and close to her and keep my ears perked in case I caught anything. After the party ended she started telling me how some of the random people at this party talked shit about her and even snapped a picture of her. I couldn't believe it, I didn't see ANY of that happen. \n\n\nLike, how do you even deal with this? just ignore it and feed into her delusions?",

He tells this story as an example: When he was a teenager, his mom said something was \"very, very nice.\" He was adamant that it was only \"very nice,\" not \"very, very nice\" and argued with her about it for so long that he made her cry. \n\nHe knows this is awful behavior and has tried hard to do better. It is still a knee-jerk response for him and he will get in modes, especially when he is stressed out, where he immediately disagrees with whatever I say, even if I am just reflecting back what he said, eg:\n\nHim: Joe was so annoying at work today, he blah blah blah\n\nMe: Yeah, that does sound annoying\n\nHim: Well it wasn't annoying exactly, it was just yeah I didn't like it.\n\nI'll suggest we do something and without even considering it he shoots it down. If I introduce a new TV show with \"I think you'll like this\" his reflexive response is \"if you put it like that I definitely won't.\" Recently I offered to share my umbrella with him, he reflexively said \"no\" without considering it, then walked in the rain and got soaked. \n\nSometimes I can just let it roll off me but if I'm already in a bad mood it can lead to some awful bickering over absolutely nothing.\n\nIs there a way to get him to snap out of it when he's acting like this? Or a way to respond to him when ever response brings on more of the thing I'm trying to avoid? \n\nAlso, when he gets like this, I worry about having kids with him. His dad is the same way and he (my partner) has a diagnosed anxiety disorder. I kind of think the 2 are related....if you grow up with someone jumping on everything you say, of course it would make you feel hypervigilant and worried all the time, right? His dad is awful in other ways that he isn't though so maybe I am overthinking it?",

Four months per year I have to work abroad in a vibrant metropolitan city that I love (I want to live here full time, but that's a long work in progress). Anyway, during these work spells it's very easy to meet people and date locals (it's not a tourist city). I'll meet a handsome and charming local man, we have passionate dates for one or two months, but then I have to return home and the guy never wants a LDR, even though I say in the beginning I want something serious and I am actively trying to move here through work. I wrote another post about this most recent episode. \n\nI then spend the next 8 months back home, isolated, alone, and heartbroken. It takes me months to get over my most recent vacation fling. Then I go back. Meet someone else. Rinse and repeat. A bad pattern. I know you'll advise me to \"stop dating while you are on your four-month work trip if you want to find a serious relationship!!\" but if I stop, then I will literally go the whole year without dating anyone. **So what's worse**: being touch starved, or being trapped in this cycle of summer flings then heartbreak, summer flings then heartbreaks....? I keep hoping that one of them will turn into a LDR (and no, it is NOT to use them to obtain PR!). I think LDRs are very difficult, but definitely better than nothing. My end goal is to find a serious relationship that hopefully ends in marriage one day, but I am not in a rush to get married.\n\nThanks for listening and for your advice. And happy new year.",

I always talk about how excited I am to be pregnant and be a mom, which she admittedly hasn’t been all that upfront but also she’s 25 and certainly never (other than that one time) expressed any disinterest in kids. I hate that her fiancé did this before their wedding. He’s from a screwed up family - never really talks about it but his open that his dad is a POS. They rushed getting engaged and idk it screams red flags. I get being scared and thinking this could be reversible but omg you’re so young. \n\nI told my husband and he said I have to tell my mom. They’ll be pissed. Or at least want to talk to her to make sure she’s feeling ok. She recently went on anxiety meds and yeah it just all seems like she’s secretly struggling. She apparently told me and one friend only- and after it was well done and over. She’s the youngest and they’re paying for her wedding. The fiancé already kinda gave us the creeps and now I’m just really worried that my sister is being manipulated and her reaching out about her period was a cry for help. I’m still digesting this. I reached out once more and asked about it and she immediately shut the conversation down.\n\nUnbiased thoughts?",

I'd be keen to hear your thoughts on if/when I should/should not tell her, and anything else that might be helpful.\n\nIn case it's important, we're both looking for something long term so this isn't just a  hookup or anything like that.",

And I think I want to go alone.  I’ve never been to a comedy show solo.  Especially not on a Friday night.  \n\nIn the past I feel like I would…feel like a loser for doing something so social on my own.  But…am I crazy that I just want to go out and do this?  Take myself on a date?\n\nI could find an actual date I’m sure if I wanted to.  Or maybe a friend would be free.  But…am I weird for wanting to just go on my own?  Take myself to this show and maybe a nice dinner after?",

If you message me, you bet I'll reply in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, I sometimes wish I could be less reliable, just a little bit. I have people in my life who leave messages \"unread\" or \"unseen\" for days, or take a while to get back to me. Apart from being a little annoyed I'm mostly jealous of this, because I see it as discipline and self control. I know that in reality they are probably just busy, anxious or forgetful, which is all fine. \n\nIn an effort to give myself a break I will sometimes turn my phone off for 12 to 24 hours, which does help. Ultimately, I really want to get better at seeing a message when I check my phone and not feeling the need to reply straightaway. I already have notifications to a minimum and I \"mute\" a lot of my group chats. \n\nI guess what I'm looking for is any mindset advice or tips that have helped you improve in this space!",

I work for with a small office staff of all women.\n\nI am very close to one of my coworkers, and not as much to the others. There was a small change in hierarchy last year that upset things quite a bit. To keep things short, I have become uncomfortable sharing details of my personal life (even small things) because certain people will pry...and pry...and pry.\n\nI am REALLY bad at saying \"no\" with this. It's something I'm working on. However, I don't want to talk about personal stuff at work, but since I have in the past, I need help on figuring out how to set this boundary.\n\nAnother important note: when I have tried to divert conversation away from me in the past, I have been asked why I am angry (I have a bit of RBF) and asked to go on a walk to share my feelings.",
