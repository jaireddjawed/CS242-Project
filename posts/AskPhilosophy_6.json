Because my understanding is that a slip is a structure with just a literal meaning (unlike the symbol) but that this meaning is the return of what was repressed by the other structures. So while the symbol hides a deeper meaning to be interpreted, the slip betrays the repressed (deeper?) meaning of things other than it. Now...is my understanding of the terms here just wrong?

        "text": "I had an 8,000+ word post typed out and deleted it for your sakes. \n\nTo keep it simple, many philosophers seem to offer motivation for human behavior or thinking, what would fall under the field of psychology. Ernest Becker wrote that humanity's fear of death motivates them to create transfer objects and deify them. Simone Weil applied her feelings to a singular factory experience to every other worker, and let's be realistic, Simone's mind is not the typical type of mind stuck in a factory. \n\nThese types of opinions seem to be just opinions. A researcher could conduct a study or deep dive interviews with a large sample size to see if these opinions are correct. What's the point for a layperson like me to even bother reading these opinions in the first place? I wouldn't read about a new algorithm for object detection if the researchers didn't bother running it against a single dataset. \n\nAnd how are their opinions any more valid than several theories I could come up with off the cuff to explain a large swathe of human behavior (I actually did this before deleting my original post)? They sound logical. They make sense. They could be easily [dis]proven with a little bit of legwork. \n\nWe can read Milgram, Asch, Skinner, Pavlov, etc. to get definitive and demonstrably repeatable explanations for certain human behaviors. There was an article today posted to the science subreddit, \"Shame makes people living in poverty more supportive of authoritarianism, study finds.\" That sounds a whole lot better than, \"Philosopher lived poor for a bit and thinks shame in poverty leads people to supporting authoritarianism.\"\n\nAnd while there is probably a fine line between arrogance and ignorance, I am asking out of ignorance and do not intend arrogance.",

        "text": "I have entry-level knowledge of some philosophy from school, but not much.  In my own life, though, I have been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting.  I would like to see where my views/questions fit into philosophy, and what I can read to further my exploration.  If you would be so kind as to read my ramblings, please let me know if you think of any material that might interest me.  It could be Western, Eastern, whatever.  \n\nMy thoughts:\n\n\\- \"I\" exist as pure will/awareness/spirit.  I am not physical (in the material sense as we understand it).  I am not my brain or my body.  My mind (ego) comes from my brain, and my brain is part of the physical world, therefore I am not my mind (ego).  I am not my thoughts and emotions.  Rather, I am a spirit experiencing the output of the brain.  But I am not the brain itself, because I can experience the brain and I can direct the brain through will.\n\n\\- Pure will is limitless in its true nature.  But, will is limited by the physical world.  Just as I cannot pick up 5000 lbs because my muscles are not strong enough, I cannot force my brain to do things that it cannot do.  If my brain chemistry is addicted to opiates, for example, then that is just another part of the physical world that my will cannot control.  Our will seems tied to the brain (but how? and is it really?), so if we let our brain go then we are letting go our ability to experience the physical world.\n\n\\- The brain is a tool that automatically generates thoughts and emotions.  As will, I choose which thoughts and emotions to entertain.  Or I can will my brain to think certain thoughts.  Or I can let go of the wheel, so to speak, and my brain runs wild on autopilot with the permutations of the ego.  One great challenge in life, for me, is to keep the mind ego under control of will (not letting the mind run wild with anger, sadness, self pity, etc).\n\n\\- For whatever reason my existence seems tied to the experience of what I call my brain.  I am experiencing what my brain is experiencing, but not what your brain is experiencing, or what any other \"matter\" is experiencing.  This is a big open question for me - how does spirit tie into the physical world?  Why do I perceive sensations from \\*this\\* clump of matter?  What is matter, anyways?  Isn't everything just fundamentally wave functions?  But wave functions of what?  Materialistic science seems to have run its course in finding smaller and smaller \"building blocks.\"  \n\n\\- Is it possible to have emergent properties, or properties at all?  Isn't all matter fundamentally the same?  \n\n\\- All labels, words, concepts, and thoughts are fictions, in the sense that they are all created by minds.  For sake of simplicity I will just call these \"labels.\"  Labels can never be 100% accurate because they are an approximation of experience, but they can never define experience itself.  Labels can be useful or harmful fictions depending on what you want to do.  When you label an object, you are making a willful choice with regard to that object.  \n\n\\- The only thing that is ever actually real is your will in the present.  Everything else is filtered and labeled by the mind.  Every person ultimately always has free will; any limitations on that free will are constructions by the ego to protect the ego.  This is the terrible paradox of human existence.  It takes a lot of strength to view every single moment of your life as your choice, your responsibility.  Most people do not face this fact because it is overwhelming.  They allow their ego to construct narratives to protect them from facing this ultimate responsibility.  This ultimate responsibility is both empowering and utterly terrifying.  But, the choice is up to you how to use your will.  You create your own meaning every single moment, because that is all that is ever real.  \n\n\\- Is this the struggle between soul and sin described in religions such as Christianity?  Is Christianity a recognition that our \"soul\" is pure will, but is corrupted through its marriage with the physical world (understanding that the physical world includes our mind, which generates bad thoughts and bad actions that we otherwise would never do)?  Is this what sin is - allowing the mind to do bad things?  But that salvation is God saying that we are ultimately good, even if we sometimes allow our minds to do bad things?\n\n\\- Or is this just one big construction of my ego?",

        "text": "So I am a novice in terms of my philosophical knowledge. I don't necessarily know all the ideas that have been used in philosophy so forgive me if some of the information in this post in inaccurate or redundant.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that my in my opinion, the end-goal of philosophy is to understand the world and our place in it in the effort to live a good life, at peace with your with own suffering. This is definitely influenced by my Buddhist lens in that everything an individual does is their deepest expression to reduce their own suffering,\n\nI have been thinking about philosophy and its purpose over the past few months and I have this idea that maybe the greatest thinkers over the past millennia and beyond have figured out all there is to know: there really is no answer to anything except uncertainty. I feel like all arguments always come to some sort of paradox of unknowing.\n\nThe true nature of reality is indescribable using concepts and intellectualizing. At the end of the day experience reigns supreme and, for example, in Buddhist meditation you get that direct experience.  Like the idea of nirvana or the \"unconditioned mind\" seems to me like the closest you can get to seeing the true nature of the world as a human being (granted, the senses aren't always the most accurate). The present moment is all that is and anything outside of the present moment is uncertain and not even worth speculating on.\n\nBranching off a bit, I'm a STEM major in university and I keep learning these concepts like Molecular Orbital Theory which describes how electrons interact but does it actually exist? Like I don't think that there is a tiny electron cloud that forms a sigma bond and that electrons form a delocalized system, I think that just happens and that order is God/creator/source\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Just because we can predict something happening x percent of the time do we actually know that it is truly what happens? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah just wanted to put this out there as I don't feel like I have many people to talk to this about and I would like some help in refining my ideas or discarding them all together.",

I have gone through the problem in two different courses and my two professors seem to have a very different idea of what Aristotle's solution to the problem is.\nOne says that Aristotle rejects that bivalence applies to future statements as it only applies to the determinately existing, so \"there will be a sea battle\" is indeterminate - neither true nor false.\nThe other holds that Aristotle doesn't reject bivalence, but holds that \"there will be a sea battle\" is not necessarily true or necessarily false, but still is either true or false (there either will or won't be a sea battle is necessarily true instead). The statement is instead contingently true or false depending on the event coming to pass. When the event does come to pass, then the statement becomes necessarily true.\n\nWhat is going on here? Are they both right? I seem to agree with the first professor's interpretation more as the second interpretation does not even seem to avoid determinism since there is still a fact of the matter in the present  about future events, regardless of our knowledge of them.

This is what he wrote for me to post here:\n\n\"Testing is finding out whether something is X. Proving is finding out whether something is X. We can say testing is more akin to an experiment, or whatever, but the ultimate purpose of the test is to prove something. I can run all the way to the white house to see whether or not the president really exists, or, in the early middle ages, run to the ocean to see if it is not made up. In either of those acts, one can claim that we are not testing anything, but rather proving, and so all testing is not proving. However, when checking to see if the ocean is real, I am testing — I am testing whether or not it is real by running to it and seeing! Therefore, my conclusion is that all testing is proving something, and all proving is testing. Testing itself is not proving. I can test whether the generator works but I am not proving the generator. Instead, testing the generator is proving whether the generator works; you can't have testing without proving, nor can you have proving without testing. So, I say, they are the same!\"\n\nWhat do you think? There is obviously a big flaw in it. Yo test x, you are proving something about x, but proving cannot be testing, the two are required of one another but not the same. Plz tell me if this wrong. Thank you",

        "text": "__Introduction__:   \n   \nThe Triangular Decision Cycle Framework Diagram is a visual tool used to track the flow of data within decision cycles. It was originally developed as a theoretical framework. The TDCF builds upon the Decision Cycle Framework (DCF) by providing a visual diagram that tracks the flow of data in decision cycles. The DCF is based on the DTM, a framework that classifies data sources into three types: spatial, time-series, and information/hypothesis, and allows for nine possible combinations of these sources to be used in decision cycles.\n   \n__Data Sources__ (DS):   \n   \nRational Agents deal with different types of data sources: observations/actions in space (S), series of observations/actions over time (T), and information/hypothesis available to an observer (I). AIXI is an example of a rational agent. Spatial data, time series data, and information can all be represented as sequences, which can potentially match each other.\n   \n__Data Transfer Methods__ (DTM):   \n   \nThe data sources can be combined in nine different ways designated as \"Input→Output (Name)\" . For example:   \nS→S (Duplicate) - Photographing an object   \nS→T (Playback) - Playing a song from sheet music   \nT→S (Record) - Recording a song onto a record   \nT→T (Repeat) - Repeating an experiment   \nI→T (Explain) - Explaining a theory verbally   \nI→S (Depict) - Depicting a theory in a graph or writing it down   \nT→I (Build, Agile) - Building a project based on a theory heard in a meeting   \nS→I (Build, Waterfall) - Building a project based on a theory read in a document   \nI→I (Model) - Modeling a hypothesis, such as weather simulation.   \n   \nEach data transfer method has an associated ratio that measures the size of the input relative to the size of the output. These ratios are necessary for measuring different objects that perform DTMs. For example:   \nS→S (Duplicate): (input meters/output meters); scale - dimensionless   \nT→T (Repeat): (input seconds/output seconds); speedup - dimensionless   \nI→I (Model): (input bits/output bits); lossy compression - dimensionless   \nT→S (Record), S→T (Playback): (input meters/output seconds); velocity and inverse   \nT→I (Build, Agile), I→T (Explain): (input bits/output seconds); bandwidth and inverse   \nI→S (Depict), S→I (Build, Waterfall): (input bits/output meters); data density and inverse   \n   \n__Decision Cycle Framework__ (DCF):   \n   \nThe framework outlines a decision-making cycle that includes the following stages:   \nData Collection: Duplicating (S→S) or recording (T→S) data.   \nHypothesis Generation: Creating a theory based on the data, generating possible depictions (I→S) - AIXI brute forces this. A literature review can be included that listens or reads about prior theories (T→I) and (S→I).   \nTesting, Simulation, and Planning: Testing, simulating, and planning based on the hypothesis by creating a model (I→I) then recording data (T→S) (data recorded from the simulation).   \nCommunication: (optional) Verbally explaining the hypothesis to others (I→T).   \nImplementation: Playing back the simulation (S→T).   \nIteration: Repeating the entire cycle as needed by repeating the experiment (T→T).   \n   \n__Triangular Decision Cycle Framework__ (TDCF):   \n   \nThe TDCF is a graphical representation of the DCF that helps to visualize the stages of the decision cycle and their interconnections.   \nAssign {S, T, I} to the vertices of an equilateral triangle. For each DTM, let its coordinate be Input + Output. Now connect the DTMs at each stage, and connect the stages using arrows. There is now a triangle that visually depicts a decision cycle as a loop. This creates an equilateral triangle with the dimensionless DTMs at the vertices and the dimensional DTMs in between.",

        "text": "Should everybody have a liturgical language to fall back on with a broader vocabulary that is more standardized.\n\nI feel like the way one talks within their community “muddies the waters” so to speak when communicating outside of your community and in a professional setting. \n\nBecause the inflections and vocal cues, etc… that you use when speaking to your family and friends is built off of this interpersonal relationships that you have with people that understand and know you more than the rest of the public.\n\nSo I’m wondering if anything thinks it’s feasible that nations that don’t have any separate liturgical or even written grammatical form of their language have problems with effective communication and expressing of ideas.\n\nBasically I’m asking does merging the way you speak at home with how you speak in any professional context limit how expressive one can be with their ideas.\n\nIn Arabic, Sanskrit, Classical Chinese, Latin, Greek, Persian and even offshoots of those language vast amounts of complex poetry and beyond colorful means of expression through literature were composed throughout history. Even after or while those languages were not the languages spoken in everyday life for the people making said poetry and literature.\n\n\nWorks that I would never imagine being able to compose something equivalent to in English. \n\nBecause especially being in America I know the mindset in school was “why tf am I in English class when I speak english” . Then now as an adult I hear people that learned English as a second language be more expressive with words than I can be, even with non-perfect grammar and a strong accent.\n\nI feel completely limited with my ability to communicate my ideas because of how unstructured my language (English) is and was wondering if anyone feels the same English or not. \n\nOr for example any of my Arabic speaking people that know classical fusha Arabic, Tamil speaking people that understand sangam literature, or anyone who grew up learning both a literary or scholarly language separately from your mother tongue but alongside your mother tongue do you find it easier to communicate your ideas through speech/writing/poetry to a wider audience effectively.",

Imp.\n\nQuestion: Kant says that we can never use people solely as means, but must use them as ends in themselves as well. What I was wondering is this: how would Kant respond to something like the trolley problem (or any sacrificial situation)? Wouldn't sacrificing 5 people for the other 1 person (even if it required no action) be using the five people solely as means? And same vice versa, that using the 1 person to save the five people is using them solely as a means? How would he resolve this?\n\nIf there is a better question in here that I'm sort of circling, please point it out/refine my argument; I'm really more trying to understand how to think of everyone as ends in themselves. This partially is because I'm writing an essay about  utilitarianism, and was wondering how Kantian ethics would apply to some of those situations.",

Additionally, given the fact that we \"all have to go through a door sooner or later,\" I have trouble understanding why anybody would abstain from even trying to begin with. \n\nI do also notice that many who refute this idea seemingly imply that all of the \"doors\" are universally ambiguous and indistinguishable; that it is ultimately a hopelessly random hat-pull. \n\nWhile I definitely do not intend to claim that religion is anywhere close to the empirical nature of modern science, I, anecdotally, do not feel that the act of choosing a religion is devoid of any and all  guidance whatsoever. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there perhaps something I am missing?

        "text": "The argument of \"ok, but what if everyone else did that?\" often comes up in arguments when I try to defend something I do that goes against the way people normally do things. Specifically, it comes up when the way I do things makes sense *only because* it goes against the way people normally do things. I'll try to give an example:\n\nImagine I want to donate 20 dollars to charity and I have two options: charity A, which helps victims of fires, and charity B, which helps undernourished children. Let's assume they both act only in my local community. Let's also assume that, while I'm still choosing, a huge fire destroys a large part of my community, injuring a lot of people and even killing a few. Finally, let's also assume that undernourishment, while present, is not a huge problem in this community. Which charity should I donate my money to?\n\nAll other things being equal (effectiveness of their work, lack of corruption among their workers, etc.) you might say that charity A needs help with more urgency. However, in a situation like this, I tend to think as follows: most people will be aware of the fire and of the urgency of donating to charity A, which means they will most likely get all the help that they need. Meanwhile, no one will be donating to charity B right now, which means they'll be needing my money more. This means that I should donate to charity B.\n\nMy problem is this: in situations like this, people tend to say \"ok, but what if everyone else thought like that too and donated to charity B? Then charity A would get no donations and the very serious problem of helping out fire victims would not be solved! This means you should not think like that\". Yes, it's true that it would be bad if everyone else thought like this too. However, we are (presumably) *not* in a world where most people think like that, and therefore it is no use to me, when deciding what to do, to think about what it would be like to live in that world. If I had good enough reasons to believe most people would follow the same thought process I did, I would then take that into account and correct my own thought process, deciding instead to donate to charity A.\n\nIs this critique of my thought process a fallacy?\n\n(Please bear in mind that the example I gave was just that: an example. The point of this exercise was just to illustrate the \"fallacy\". I am not asking for moral guidance on which charity I should help, I am just asking about the validity of the argument I presented)",

It seems counter-intuitive but it completely nullifies the problem of violence, which would otherwise be impossible.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/11fdyjj/why_does_karl_popper_say_that_positing_inductive/",
        "text": "Hi everyone! \n\nI was reading the first chapter of Karl Popper's \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery.\" I completely understand his problem with induction if someone claims that induction gives a definite conclusion, say a \"True\" or \"False.\" \n\nHowever, he, later on, says that it would not be any different if we instead posit that inductive arguments show the probability of a hypothesis instead of a definite conclusion just like earlier. I do not understand how Popper concluded this claim and I would like to ask for help. The relevant passage that shows Popper saying this goes like this: \n\n\"At this stage, I can disregard the fact that the believers in inductive logic entertain an idea of probability... I can do so because the difficulties mentioned are not even touched by an appeal to probability. For if a certain degree of probability is to be assigned to statements based on inductive inference, then this will have to be justified by invoking a new principle of induction, appropriately modified. And this new principle in its turn will have to be justified and so on. Nothing is gained, moreover, if the principle of induction, in its turn, is taken not as 'true' but only as 'probable'. In short, like every other form of inductive logic, the logic of probable inference, or 'probability logic', leads either to an infinite regress or to the doctrine of aphorism.\"\n\nIn my understanding, Popper rejects inductive logic even if we say that it merely implies probability and not certainty because to prove inductive logic means having to refer to another instance in the past, which would then be proven by another one before that, and so on. However, I seem to not be able to comprehend why an infinite regress means we cannot say inductive logic works if we say it implies probabilities.\n\nThank you so much in advance to those who will help me. It will be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "Hei.  I was thinking about the abstract idea of ​​kindness and ethics and came to a philosophical paradox:\n\n If we consider kindness and ethics as a sincere concern for the well-being of others, the perception of other people's suffering as one's own and the desire for it to end, then logical thinking leads to the idea that any killing is an act of kindness and ethics, because it ends the suffering of living beings.\n\n There is an unimaginable amount of suffering in the world from birth, violence, want, old age, disease, poverty, infirmity, death.\n\n Humans are just one of millions of species, as are all beings with a nervous system and a brain that feel suffering.\n\n Even if you just look at the clouds and the sun, you had to kill and eat someone, because the brain needs biochemical substances and energy to work.  And the phone I'm dialing this from contains more blood and suffering than any of us can imagine.\n\n Not eating meat is a radical reduction in suffering, but they are still caused - when plowing fields, even under beans, mice, birds, lizards, insects, snakes die.  The driver of the truck that carried these beans ate the meat, and a huge number of creatures were indirectly killed to create the truck.  When a living being walks on the ground, it tramples on insects that have a nervous system and feel the pain of pain.  And so on.\n\n Any form of life, existence and consciousness can only exist by killing and devouring other suffering creatures.  Thus, each time killing someone, not only the infliction of suffering by this particular creature stops, but also the potential chain of suffering in the future stops - the killed creature will not spawn new suffering creatures that would cause suffering to others.\n\n The destruction of all life on the planet is technically impossible, but theoretically it would be the highest manifestation of kindness, because it would stop all the suffering of living beings.\n\n Perhaps this question could be formulated better than I did, but I hope that the general meaning will be clear.  Let's see the forest for the trees.\n\n What are some other thoughts on this?",
