Ninth Sister felt his feet grip her shoulders as he shifted.\n\n‚ÄúPerhaps you should come observe the phenomena for yourself,‚Äù he suggested.\n\n‚ÄúYou can predict this behavior?‚Äù Ninth Sister asked.\n\n‚ÄúUnder certain conditions yes,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúThe human in question is currently in her quarterly review and will demonstrate the behavior quite nicely if the pattern holds. We should be able to observe it from that round table by the cafe.‚Äù\n\nNinth Sister took the hint and strolled over to the table. The server, a respectably sized human who only came to her antenna tips came out to take their order and retreated back into the establishment. The Winged commander flitted up to the crossbeams that supported the solar shade and hung with his beady little eyes pointed at the door to the administration office. The server brought out a chilled nectar for Ninth Sister and a dish of protein crystals for the Winged commander. He flitted down to the table to snatch one up and held it between his needle like teeth as they waited. Ninth Sister dipped her siphon into the refreshing drink and watched with mild interest as the protein crystal began to form a red froth around the Winged‚Äôs teeth. The forth crept out and covered his lips before his tongue flicked out and began licking it.\n\n‚ÄúYou know the human‚Äôs consider this habit one of the most terrifying,‚Äù she observed.\n\n‚ÄúOne of the main reasons they call us Hellbats,‚Äù he gurgled back at her.\n\nHer antenna flexed down to wipe her mandibles in disgust and she barely managed to contain the reaction. Fortunately the Winged seemed not to understand the gesture and kept happily licking the froth off of his lips. He had finished the first crystal and started on a second when the door of the administration room irised open.\n\nA single human stalked out. It was one of the newer resident professors. A midsized female with light golden coloration and the pigment-less eyes the humans called blue. Ninth Sister tilted her head curiously at the woman. She was clenching a notebook tightly in one hand. She came just far enough out of the administration room for the door to cycle shut and then her chest expanded in that peculiar mammalian behavior.  The fleshly lids blinked over her eyes several times and then she abruptly turned and strode along the wall of the building complex.\n\n‚ÄúNow you will see,‚Äù the Winged commander said with a smug note in his voice. ‚ÄúThere she goes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAnd you say she was simply engaging in her quarterly assessment?‚Äù Ninth Sister asked.\n\n‚ÄúI am sure of it,‚Äù the Winged said. ‚ÄúAs a commander I have access to the schedule. There!‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat is in fact the supply storage facility,‚Äù Ninth Sister said as the human opened the door and stepped in. ‚ÄúPerhaps she simply needs to get supplies?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAfter every quarterly assessment?‚Äù the Winged demanded. ‚ÄúAnd she never leaves with anything she didn‚Äôt take in there with-‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSilence!‚Äù Ninth Sister suddenly snapped, her frill flaring and her antenna perking up.\n\nIn an instant Ninth Sister was on her feet and bolting across the green space towards the storage compartment. The Winged commander took off after her and managed to grab onto her kilt.\n\n‚ÄúWhat got in your horns?‚Äù he demanded.\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you hear that?‚Äù she hissed.\n\n‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù the Winged commander asked.\n\n‚ÄúIt must be too low for you to register,‚Äù Ninth Sister said.\n\nHer long loping stride had taken them to the door of the storage area and Ninth Sister yanked the door open and called out.\n\n‚ÄúHuman-‚Äù Ninth Sister stopped and glanced down at the Winged commander with a feeling of consternation as she realized she didn‚Äôt know the human‚Äôs name.\n\n‚ÄúProfessor Nowak,‚Äù the Winged commander supplied helpfully.\n\nProfessor Nowak was crouched on the floor of the storage space. She had snapped her head around when Ninth Sister opened the door and was staring at them with her eyes so wide that the whites were clearly visible all the way around her irises. Her notebook was clenched between her teeth and the rear claw of a low scream was tapering off.\n\n‚ÄúWould you like to come join us Professor Nowak?‚Äù Ninth Sister asked .\n\nProfessor Nowak disengaged her jaw with visible effort of the muscles along her neck and fell back on her padded hips. She stared quietly at them for a moment before closing her eyes, tossing her head back, and bursting out into laughter.\n\n‚ÄúAy, did I make you worried Freinds?‚Äù she asked.\n\n‚ÄúI will admit to some concern when I heard you screaming,‚Äù Ninth Sister admitted.\n\n‚ÄúA little help up?‚Äù the human asked, holding up her hand.\n\nNinth Sister reached out a hand and braced her rear legs to pull. The Winged commander flitted over and made a show of pulling up on the human‚Äôs thumb. The human laughed and stood with Ninth Sister‚Äôs help.\n\n‚ÄúA joker you are,‚Äù Professor Nowak said. ‚ÄúI suppose you want an explanation for why I‚Äôm hiding in a storage locker screaming my lungs out ay?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI for one would appreciate it,‚Äù Ninth Sister said.\n\n‚ÄúWell thanks for coming to check on me,‚Äù the human said. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs nothing serious. I had my quarterly today you know?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am aware,‚Äù Ninth Sister said.\n\n‚ÄúWell I get,‚Äù the human squinted as they stepped out into the natural light, ‚Äúoverly anxious about it. So I deal with it by over prepping. Keeps me focused like.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat   sounds reasonable,‚Äù Ninth Sister agreed.\n\n‚ÄúBut I always over prepare,‚Äù Professor Nowak went on. ‚ÄúSo I come out and I have all that extra nervous energy built up and nowhere to spend it productively. So I just find a nice quiet place and scream the rest of it off. Perfectly normal ay?‚Äù\n\nShe flashed her teeth at them and then turned to jog off towards the research offices.\n\n‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù the Winged commander asked.\n\n‚ÄúIs it what?‚Äù Ninth Sister asked.\n\n‚ÄúPerfectly normal to find a human curled up in the corner screaming,‚Äù he clarified.\n\n‚ÄúI do not know,‚Äù she replied.\n\n# Please go leave a review on my 3rd book \"Humasn are Weird: Let's Work it Out\"\n\n## [Amazon (Kindle, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NN2PM8D?binding=paperback&amp;ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tpbk)\n\n## [Barnes &amp; Nobel (Nook, Paperback, Audiobook)](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Humans+are+Weird%22?Ntk=P_Series_Title&amp;Ns=P_Series_Number&amp;Ntx=mode+matchall)\n\n## [Kobo by Rakuten (ebook and Audiobook)](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Humans%20are%20Weird&amp;fcsearchfield=Series&amp;seriesId=a035ce04-e582-5fcc-b327-16c68ca4b418&amp;fcshowpointsprice=no&amp;fcmaxprice=5&amp;fcminprice=0&amp;id=1561e6f7-742f-4c1b-a804-187728814574)\n\n## [Google Play Books (ebook and Audiobook)](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Humans_are_Weird_I_Have_the_Data?id=7_wdEAAAQBAJ&amp;gl=US)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/i7cek8z02c9a1.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[\"Dying Embers\" Dragons, Aliens, and Things that go boomp in the night.](https://smile.amazon.com/Dying-Embers-Dragons-Aliens-Things-ebook/dp/B08D385M73?ref_=ast_sto_dp)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bvtavcz42c9a1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff60f1bfd58b319a0dd9d2825b2b052a1aa6330d\n\n#  [AmazonSmile: Dying Embers : Dragons, Aliens, and Things That Go Boomp in the Night eBook : Adams , Betty , Zabelina , Yuliya , Wong, Richard : Kindle Store](https://smile.amazon.com/Dying-Embers-Dragons-Aliens-Things-ebook/dp/B08D385M73?ref_=ast_sto_dp)",

        "text": "Last year, I wrote a piece trying to use 50 years of science-fiction &amp; fantasy awards data to [determine some of the greatest novels since 1970](https://medium.com/@cassidybeevemorris/determining-best-science-fiction-fantasy-novels-since-1970-e232ecbdc34d). It was a fun exercise in data science (comparing books across time, weighting novels, etc.) and seeing what turns up. I promised to write an update at the end of each year with the new awards data. I'll include a [link](https://medium.com/@cassidybeevemorris/the-greatest-science-fiction-fantasy-novels-of-2022-34a58616ef07) in the comments for a deeper analysis and methodology if interested.\n\n**The top 5 books of the 2022 award season:**\n\n* 5. She Who Became the Sun by Shelley Parker-Chan\n* 4. The Jasmine Throne by Tasha Suri\n* 3. Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir\n* 2. A Master of Djinn by P. Dj√®l√≠ Clark\n* 1. A Desolation Called Peace by Arkady Martine\n\n*Honorable mentions:* Light from Uncommon Stars by Ryka Aoki and Shards of Earth by Adrian Tchaikovsky received four nominations each. The Unbroken by C.L. Clark and Klara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro each received three major nominations.\n\n**Did any make the top 100 of all time?**\n\nAs it turns out, the answer is yes. A Desolation Called Peace by Martine is head-and-shoulders above the rest of this year‚Äôs publications and thus has earned itself rank #26 compared to every work since 1970.\n\nFurthermore, A Master of Djinn by Clark also sneaks in at spot #62, despite only one major award win. With The Lathe of Heaven by Le Guin and Perdido Street Station by Mieville nearby, we can see that the top 100 is chock-full of impressive works. Project Hail Mary by Weir didn‚Äôt make the top 100 but sits nearby at #116.\n\n**How competitive is the SFF landscape today?**\n\nTo compare books across time, it‚Äôs essential to control for various factors. One such factor that I described in my previous analysis is author competition. In the 1970‚Äôs, fewer authors were writing great science fiction compared to today; this is not so surprising, given the genre‚Äôs popularity over time. More readers of the genre today = more writers and books to choose from.\n\nHowever, we may have recently entered a slight downturn in the number of authors winning awards. Compared to a peak in the early 2010s, competition has been sliding down year-over-year and now sits 8% lower. That‚Äôs not a dramatic shift, but worth keeping an eye on. This change is a result of the dominance of N.K. Jemisin in recent years, as well as Ann Leckie‚Äôs ‚ÄòAncillary Series‚Äô absorbing 22 nominations in four years. On the other hand, rising stars like Arkady Martine have now begun to shake up the landscape, so it‚Äôll be interesting to see if this trend continues.\n\n**There's more information about how this year's award season shakes up the top *authors* list of all time, as well as, a deep dive on the greatest SFF duologies of all time in the [full article](https://medium.com/@cassidybeevemorris/the-greatest-science-fiction-fantasy-novels-of-2022-34a58616ef07).** \n\nBut, this post is already quite long. Let me know if there's any awards you think I missed or feedback on how to improve for next year. Cheers and have a great new years!",

I am about two-thirds in and feeling disappointed. The book is alright, but it reads like a teen novel, a rehash of hunger games. It's alright but not what I am looking for. \n\nCould anyone here recommend a solid hard science fiction read? I gravitate toward things that are more accurate or at least feel plausible. It doesn't have to be a perfect science, but there has to be some technical knowledge for world-building. I am ok with some world politics, but I have a hard time following too many characters. \n\nLet me share with you some of my favorite books, in no particular order:\n\n* Foundation\n* Dune\n* Ecnaldues Mission\n* We are legion\n* Children of time series\n* Rama series\n* All three body problem series\n* Most Ted Chiang stories\n* Ursula Le Guin boo\n* Project Hail mary \n\nOut of this list, I enjoyed the three-body problem the most, and Ted Chiang's material as a close second. I had a good chuckle with Project Hail mary and really enjoyed the first Children of time.   \nDune was a bit heavy and so was Foundation. The Rama series was amazing but felt outdated. \n\nTLDR: This community is incredible and introduced me to great authors. Please help me find a contemporary series or book that leans on hard science or at least extrapolates from real-world science. I want my imagination to soar with mind-bending ideas.   \n\n\nLooking forward to your recommendations! Happy new Year, everyone.",

They also abuse children and use women as young as 9 or younger as literal birthing machines pumped with hormones.\n\nThe ICOG literally dedicate their entire society and culture to war efforts while using ultraviolence against all non-humans as opposed to doing diplomacy and pragmatism. The reason was that they got their feelings hurt¬†by the last batch of genocidal aliens in the 6th millennium AD and their entire ideology is just incomprehensibly petty revenge because of that.\n\nEven though they're supposed to be a human supremacist faction, the ICOG sees every single human being, including children, as just disposable creatures to die fighting in wars, to the point where they'll go so far as to use generation ships as suicide bombs and use an entire population of a human occupied star system as meat shields for no reason. Not to mention, they'll murder any of their own kind that isn't a baseline human or an asshole towards the human race. It comes across as them not just being highly xenophobic but also highly misanthropic in the most brazenly violent way possible.\n\nThey lasted from 5408 AD to 25,000 AD despite being evil to the point of being so stupid that they shouldn't really be able to comprehend or let alone use their hyperadvanced technologies properly. So, the ICOG lasting longer than the Imperium of Man is pretty pretty illogical as hell, even in a fictional context, given their sheer stupidity alone.",

This has to look and feel like a memory in order not to be detected by the memorynet as a threat.\n\nI am thinking of a memory where lights flash on and off slowly, like stars winking on and off in the night. It will look like a strange memory of star gazing, but once uploaded the winking stars turn into code that attack the structure of the memorynet. Perhaps a kind of binary code. \n\nHas anyone seen anything like this? Does this sound at all plausible to you? Any ideas for how to make it more so?",

        "text": "Hear me out.\nEverything I‚Äôve heard about The Thing (1982) is that every scene is important. Most details, if not all of them, are important to the plot, with some room for continuity errors and the like. \nTo get to the point: It‚Äôs been a debate as old as the movie itself, apparently, as to which member of the US team in the movie became infected first, with the majority of those on the internet concluding that it was either Palmer, or Norris, the majority of them thinking it was Palmer. \nIt wasn‚Äôt Palmer. \nA scene, after the infected dog arrives at the base and is given free reign to wander its grounds, but before the majority of the team are aware that there‚Äôs a serious problem, stuck out to me both times that I finally watched it. Particularly, Palmer watching a game show with who I believe was Childs. Palmer soon stands up, walks to the tv, and changes it to another episode or show, before sitting back down saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen this how this ends.‚Äù He then lights up a blunt - smokes from it, and then passes it to Childs who presumably shared it with Palmer. And then the scene ends. So why is it shown at all? What was the director trying to convey with this scene that otherwise seemingly has nothing to do with the plot?\nMuch later on, Nauls suggests to MacReady that everyone should prepare their own food, specifically not sharing anything or coming into contact with other‚Äôs food, as to not pass on any potential infections. This assumes that coming into contact with anything that is consumed by a person can spread infection - like a blunt. \nPalmer couldn‚Äôt have been infected when he shared the blunt with Childs, as if he were, Childs, who is later specifically tested on whether or not he is infected, is vindicated that he isn‚Äôt. \nWe never see Norris at any period of time around the scene with Palmer and Childs, nor would Palmer have had enough time to have been so completely infected to have been able to become fully perfect in form to fool the entire team, and then pickup the keys that Windows had accidentally dropped in the storage room to use in order to open the blood storage box, destroy the blood, and then close it and lock it again. Norris, who we haven‚Äôt seen much of, soon after the blood box is found to have been sabotaged, declines leadership of the team offered by MacReady on the grounds of ‚Äúnot feeling up to it‚Äù.\nWould love your thoughts and critiques! Thank you for reading!",

        "text": "I'm about 10 episodes in and holy crap, this is one of the best Buddy Cop and Sci-fi shows I've ever seen. I only ever saw it once or twice on TV as a kid but the gritty portrayal of LA, late 80s-early 90s \"world\" music and the Tenctonese aliens were a bit beyond what a first grader could handle lol.\n\nI've been on a 90's sci-fi kick and found that a lot of it... does not hold up well but AN is some top shelf shit. The chemistry between Sikes, a human detective forced to work with George, an alien is incredible. I thought this was going to be some low budget, dry procedural series with little character development and all the goofy tropes of televised 90s sci-fi but it turned out to be the opposite - tons of character development with a small serving of procedural crime-of-the-week stuff. Even then, the crime stuff usually runs parallel with topics that George and Sikes are affected by.\n\nLike, the premise of a ship crashing to earth carrying 250k alien slaves should be hokey, but I buy it because of how well executed it is. It's fascinating to see the issues of racism and prejudice the Tenctonese deal with when trying to integrate with human society.. What's even better is that the show (10 eps in anyway) heavily focuses on George and his family. His wife and 2 children get lots of screen time for the daily shit they deal with. When things get heavy, it's balanced with humor like George botching up human cliches and terms. I legit lol'd at his observation that human society values nacho attitudes in men instead of macho or when wild whores couldn't drag him away from a case. It's also pretty humorous (but also soberingly based on reality) that Tectonese individuals are given names by the government based on pop culture, literary, film and sports names. Betsy Ross for instance, is a criminal kingpin that blows up several organized crime leaders.\n\nI never write stuff like this but I felt compelled to because Alien Nation seems completely lost to time. Also I guess this was near the beginning of FOX's reputation for cancelling tons of shows. At least there are several movies produced after the cancellation so I hope they hold up to what I've seen so far.",
