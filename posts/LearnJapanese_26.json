Recently I started learning anki decks (the core 2000 one with pictures) and noticed that some pronunciations are not expected, like え、が、ご most of the time sound like i/nga/ngo, and か、こ、た、と sometimes sound like ga/go/da/do, and some other similar things. So I'm just wondering, is it because they do not exactly match English pronunciations and my ears are doing funny things or are they actually pronounced differently from individual kanas? If it's the latter, then what happens if I read them like the individual kanas, will that be considered wrong / confuse native speakers?\n\nFor example... if you put 夫 into google translate and click the 'read it' button, is it saying otto or oddo?",

I've been studying Japanese for a few years now to be able to better work with some Japanese colleagues. Thank you for answering my question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne major difficulty I've always had is the difference between する and やる. Generally, I just use する and that has gotten me through just fine. However, for example, an expression like \"Do what you want\" I hear as both 「すきにする」and 「すきにやる」in a form such as 「すきにしよう」and「すきにやろう」. As far as I understand (according to some native speakers), the intricacies are that 「すきにやろう」implies that the thing you want to do is more action based, but it is still very vague for me, it seems like either can be used in all obvious situations. If possible, would you kindly explain? Or perhaps this distinction is too subtle for an obvious description?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to answer my question.\n\nManakyn",

RTK for example, I spent months doing, only reached chapter 17 or so. I liked the idea of learning the meanings to help you recall the kanji for the purpose of writing but I don't like how much effort is required for being ultimately unable to actually read Japanese by the end of it. I have been trying out the free levels with Wanikani which I like well enough, but I don’t want to be forced into a subscription anytime I want to review/refresh my memory, and $200-300 for the lifetime membership is a steep asking price next to alternatives like KKLC/Anki.\n\nI see it recommended often enough to simply \"just learn words\" which I have tried, plugging in words into Anki with kanji that I encounter “organically” as suggested by resources like Cure Dolly. I like this approach well enough, but I am worried I won’t be able to retain the readings of kanji/words when my Anki deck grows large since so many kanji that look similar or are complex. **Is mere repetition enough for long-term retention, or are you supposed to be learning the radicals that make up each kanji, referencing them in something like KKLC?**\n\nThe thing I don’t really like about a lot of these kanji learning methods is that it just feels like you’re cramming a bunch of kanji or words in a predetermined order that you won’t actually be using or seeing often enough in context. So I thought it would be better to learn kanji from the vocabulary in my textbook (Japanese for Everybody) and ones I encounter out in the wild, putting them in Anki and learning the radicals that make them up, which I’m hoping would help with retention in the long-term.\n\nThere seems to be so many different ways to learn kanji. Not every method works for everyone, but it makes it hard to determine ahead of time if it’s going to work for me without wasting time on it, stunting my progress due to that fear and indecision, so I am looking for thoughts and insight on this to help me decide on a direction to pursue, if this kind of approach worked for you, or if there is a better way you found.",

Do we ask the other person for permission or do we just stop using honorifics altogether one day? With other languages where politeness is also important like French or Italian and Spanish, you can just ask the other person and it's as simple as that and it's sometimes not even necessary when we're about the same age. Can I do the same with Japanese and ask for permission just like that? Any feedback would be appreciated. Thank you all in advance!",

        "text": "Hi everyone\n\nI would like to start a company in the next year, I am an electrical engineer by profession and in my spare time I am interested in Japanese culture, which started with watching anime in middle school. \n\nI would like the name of the company to be Japanese but easy to understand for Europeans and its meaning to be related to electricity as a profession/electricity as an element/nature (animals, plants), etc. and I would like the name to sound strong, like just \"Raigo\" or \"Fulgur\" (lightning in Latin)\n\nI was looking for inspiration from anime/games/culture that were related to electricity.\n\nI know that \"rai\" is lightning in Japanese, I would like the name to have that part in it. For the moment, \"Raigo\" (Enel's attack from One Piece and the Japanese wordplay for \"good morning\") suits me.  I love the sound of \"raikiri\" or \"raikage\" (lighting + shadow) but it's too associated with Naruto. Could someone throw up some particles that would fit the word \"rai\" and be related to electricity? I'd rather \"create\" a word myself instead of drawing from a ready-made one. I've searched for Japanese electrical vocabulary, but they don't suit me or just too obvious.\n\nI don't know if I'm thinking correctly, but if I add the word \"ou\" (meaning king) to the word \"rai\" will an electric king arise? Or is it some word without any meaning? I care most about combining two separate words, the name doesn't have to mean anything, as long as parts of it are related to electricity as a profession/electricity as an element/nature (animals, plants)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks a lot to everyone for their help!",

It was mostly, about reading text quite above my current level, and, the replies were.. mixed :D\n\n# The progress itself\n\nSo, now is the progress. I am very much happy by this part. Grammar wise, I don't need to look up just as much now (And, it was the thing that took the longest to took up, so that part, is very much most important).  \nVocabulary wise, it is getting better, but, I do have to look up that constantly nonetheless.  \n\n\nStill, for me, this progress is very satisfying, considering I am only doing, like, 10 minutes of anki and 20 minutes of reading every day  \n\n\nAnd the endurance itself, still, it got better as well &gt;:3  \n\n\n# The more comfy way to read\n\nSo. This one is more about using ereader...  \nEither way, conventional screens, are not too pleasant to read on. So I thought: Read on e-ink.   \nBecause oh boy, do I love e-ink, and how pleasant it is on the eyes when compared with conventional screen types like LCD or AMOLED   \n\n\nObviously, what I needed, was not just any e-ink, but one, with decent refresh rate. So, I bought Onyx Tab Ultra.  \nThen I installed kiwi browser, set up yomichan, throw books into ッツ Ebook Reader, and here, the fun begins.  \n\n\nSo, even on HD refresh mode, which is the slowest, yomichan word look ups take like, minimally less than 1 second? Which is hella amazing for me. And then, Balanced/Fast mode, the look up is pretty much instantaneous   \n\n\nAnd, to be honest, I found it help me to read for longer periods of time as well. So, mega happy.\n\nAnd now, here, a photo of how it looks (Too bad, I can't inline photos, so have to post on imgur)  \n[Japanese, Kiwi Browser, Onyx](https://imgur.com/a/STLIcWB)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# What next\n\nI am just going to chill, and enjoy the ride, as the reading, despite having to look things up, very much.. pleasant experience, with hope that one day I will be able to read books without constantly looking things up, like it happened with English",
