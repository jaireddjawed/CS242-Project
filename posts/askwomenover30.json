We have a monthly routine to FaceTime each other ever since I left the family home at age 25. \n\nThe topic of my upcoming 36th birthday came up in our most recent one. She asked if I had any plans. I said not really. She followed up with whether I plan on at least dinner with \u201csomeone special\u201d, which made my eye roll. \n\nSo I am currently a single woman. Not really into relationships. I stay single by choice because, honestly, I like being single. Anyway, ever since I entered my 30s, my mother has asked about relationships and marriage. All of which I avoided by saying that \u201cI\u2019m still enjoying my single life\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d Despite asking those questions, my mother didn\u2019t seem at all surprised and would respond with, \u201cOh well, it\u2019s your life after all.\u201d \n\nI thought this time again was one of those times so I responded with the usual above phrases. It was different because she had this frustrated expression. She asked if I\u2019m a lesbian, which I responded that I\u2019m not. She pressed on further saying that she\u2019s okay with it as long as I find someone nice. I got frustrated myself and told her, \u201cMom, no, I\u2019m not a lesbian. And as I told you probably for the 100th time that I\u2019m not interested in seeing anyone. I\u2019m not interested in getting married.\u201d\n\nShe was quiet for maybe a minute. Then said, \u201cBut you\u2019re already 35, turning 36 soon. *Why*?\u201d \n\nI explained to her *again* that I enjoy my single life. I have nothing against marriage. I\u2019m not saying marriage is bad. But I\u2019m just not interested. I just can\u2019t imagine myself being married. I may find myself in a relationship someday. When it does happen, *that\u2019s* when I\u2019ll think about marriage. But it\u2019s probably not going to happen anytime soon.\n\nImmediately she started crying and told me that she\u2019s \u201cdisappointed in me.\u201d I asked her why is she disappointed. She said that, because I\u2019m the only daughter, she spent her whole life dreaming of my marriage, the whole wedding dress shopping thing, meeting my future husband, looking forward to grandchildren, etc. Sure, my brothers are married and she has a good daughter-in-law relationship with their spouses. But she wants to see *me* married. She also said how my father still is looking forward to walking me down the aisle. Be proud of how much I\u2019ve grown since I was always his \u201clittle princess.\u201d She asked whether I don\u2019t feel guilty about not being able to grant their wishes? She\u2019s sad and disappointed that I grew up to be this way. \n\nI couldn\u2019t really respond. I assumed that they had sort of given up on me with the whole marriage thing. That they\u2019d be supportive of my lifestyle because they never really showed any dissatisfaction. My mother begged me in tears to rethink my future. Saying that it\u2019s not too late if I start now. That I don\u2019t need to be the black sheep. She says they\u2019re not trying to be harsh or controlling, just want the best for me because they are worried about me. They don\u2019t want me to die a lonely woman, to which I responded with, \u201cWell, then that\u2019ll just be \u2018my\u2019 problem so you don\u2019t really have to worry\u201d making my mother cry again. \n\nWe ended the FaceTime in an awkward note, and I haven\u2019t heard from her since then (usually we\u2019d text each other every day). I\u2019m a bit lost with how to proceed. I love my parents and would love to make them happy. If there were other ways to make them happy I would but, after hearing all that, I don\u2019t know if I could. I don\u2019t think I could change my lifestyle. If I was so desperate for relationship\/marriage, I would\u2019ve worked on it a long time ago. But I guess I *do* feel guilty about it. It\u2019s a sucky feeling knowing that my parents are disappointed in me. \n\nCan anyone relate? Am I being selfish for making my parents sad?

Never been happier","author":"Desigirl8728","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11qgm3v\/last_week_i_quit_my_job_never_been_happier\/","text":"\n\nLast week  I quit my very high paying job at the world\u2019s biggest online retailer. I joined this company two years ago, despite all the negative press it gets because of its toxic culture.   my options were limited because of my work visa so I took this job on , knowing it might be a high risk,and high rewards situation .Also, my priority back then was to leave my prior employer who was a complete psychopath. For two years in this company,  I was thriving despite the toxic leadership because I had a good manager who acted as a barrier. My manager left 2 months ago and then life  just became hell here. I was working all the time and it felt super counterproductive because the new manager just didn\u2019t know how to run this team. The leadership (my managers manager, and the  3 managers above ) loved public courts of shame, where my work was criticized and shamed in live review meetings for the past several weeks. I realize that I\u2019ve seen this happen to other people at this company before and while I knew it was bad, I didn\u2019t know how much it affects your psychology till i experienced it first hand. Imagine being afraid while you are awake and also being afraid while you are asleep. I used to get dreams about these review meetings where I was defending my work. \n\nSome good things resulted because of this job, or rather the circumstances it put me in. It made me move cities where I met my soulmate, and now we are happily married. I got this company\u2019s brand name on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and a skill set that will open up more doors. Life as a single woman in my old city, and having no friends (cuz people moved away during pandemic or just got stranger ) made me feel really stuck two years ago. Since I started this job, two years have gone by fast and life has kept me very busy. This also helped me overcome my depression because for me free time resulted in more depression spirals. \n\nI have the privilege to quit because of a supportive partner. I\u2019m going to take some downtime for a few months. \nNext time I start a job, I\u2019m not going to have visa limitations, and I\u2019m going to pick a company that is kind to its people and tough  on its business, rather than other way around. \n\nThe sense of relief I have surpasses any prior good news. It\u2019s only second to the day I was approved to adopt my dog and saw her for the first time. \n\nIt\u2019s crazy how much unhappiness and misery bad jobs or bad bosses bring into our lives. I literally feel reborn again as a free individual. \n\nWhy I am sharing this ? Some good lessons here that might help others \n - calculated risks sometimes pay off. Accept the new challenge even if you have just one good thing working in your favor. Even if you don\u2019t succeed , it\u2019s a going to be a stepping stone to open the world to limitless possibilities","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678730361.0},{"title":"Women who are married with children - would you be hurt if your partner told you that they love your children more than you?","author":"butterisafoodgroup89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11q8c31\/women_who_are_married_with_children_would_you_be\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678710502.0},{"title":"Please tell me about a dumb purchase you made","author":"Vivid-Language6500","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11qay8a\/please_tell_me_about_a_dumb_purchase_you_made\/","text":"Spent a lot of money on something kind of frivolous\u2026 and feeling guilty about it.

It became a toxic dynamic really quickly. 6 months into engagement he reconnected with his ex. We would have a lot if disagreements, fights and all. We both were loosing ourselves. Finally he broke it off October of last yr. It was very traumatic. I flew out to see him. It was very bittersweet. Stayed there for 8 days and came back We patched up. He on the other hand wouldn't discuss what he was actually thinking. Would still talk about marriage. Long story short, he remained connected with his ex through that time(how I know is that he would often text things in btw but then give a strange explanation for it). Continued to tell me he loved me and wanted marriage. He started checking out emotionally and I missed that point. He would continue to be intimate virtually but looking back now it was really weird he was checked out.\n Would continue to ask him what's wrong, he would say everything is fine. \n\nThen 1st week of Jan, completely blindsided me in a nasty BU saying he can't trust me and doesn't feel comfortable with me. I walked away and didn't plead or beg.I sent a final text and went NC.\n\nDuring the time he was planning to blindside me he made 2 horrible playliste on youtube and made them public. He put in songs in there that he would dedicate to me along with songs hinting I manipulated him, I use men for my beauty, he's tired of making me happy cause I have daddy issues etc.\n\nHe comes from a family with a lot of dysfunction but I never shamed him. Seeing these playlists post BU was really bad. I was really angry and ashamed. \nKnowing what I had went through a lot in my life he did exactly what I've faced time and time again.\nI have taken myself off of Facebook and deleted him from my social media. I feel this deep shame and disgust with myself. \nHe's already in a relationship and is planning to get married.\nHow do I overcome this shame?

I don\u2019t want to go into details, but it was incredibly traumatic for my family. The police were involved. It was very serious. Our house was searched. The whole 9 yards. We were interrogated for years until they finally realized none of us were involved. It\u2019s been a few years and I didn\u2019t realize how much it affected me - last year I went through a depression episode and spiralled. I had to go into therapy. So much of my life has been shaped by this one tragedy. My siblings and parents are still suffering to this day as a result of the event. We moved cities. Very few of my friends\/acquaintances know about this tragic event in our lives. Many of them don\u2019t even know I had a sister who passed away. We have all remained very private about this and the authorities cooperated with us to keep it private as well. No newspaper articles were ever published. \n\nMy sister received a strange email from a journalist through someone she worked with in a non-profit organization (Emma). We make an active effort to remain anonymous online and are very private. I guess the journalist googled my sister\u2019s name to find out that she was connected to Emma. Emma lives in the same city as us, and did not know about my deceased sister. Emma wanted to meet with my sister about this email, and my sister had to explain the backstory. My sister refused to give her contact details to the journalist and advised Emma to refuse on her behalf as well. Well, a few months later, the journalist e-mails my sister through the Emma again and says she is creating a podcast about the event. She\u2019s a well known journalist. She said that she would be willing to fly out to meet us if we want to participate in this. I\u2019m angry because I don\u2019t know how the news got to the journalist years later - someone who knew the details when the event took place from our previous city must have told her. And I\u2019m also angry that the Emma, who did not know any of this, now knows our private affairs because of the journalist. \n\nAs you can imagine, I am fuming. It\u2019s been years, the chapter has been closed, all of us have just began to move on, and now this journalist wants to open our old wounds. Why would we want to participate in this podcast? Our grief and trauma is not worth any amount of money or fame. My parents suffer from multiple health issues because of the stress and grief. She did not respect our privacy, we are not obligated to speak to her. What should we do? We are planning on not giving her a response at all. Is there any legal action we can take (we live in North America). I don\u2019t want to be too confrontational in case this blows up in our face. I do not want my family to communicate with her because it will just open a can of worms and open the door to open communication. So far, we only know that the journalist is going to use aliases in her story telling. It\u2019s incredibly sad that some journalists are so unethical and will use traumatic real life events to profit off of people\u2019s grief.

We were together for 10 years and married for 4.5 years. He attended schooling throughout the summers of 2018 to 2022 to get his dream job. During that time I would look after our home and dogs. We had talked about having a family one day, but I wasn't willing to start a family\/go through the process of pregnancy alone while he was away so frequently. Not to mention how busy he is with all his other extra curricular activities hockey, volunteer job etc. He promised he would have time for me after all of his schooling and we would have lots of time to spend together to get our relationship back on track. He had been struggling with his mental health in the fall of 2021, told me he didn't want to live and things would be better off if he was unalived. He started to see a therapist of his own shortly after, and we also started couples therapy in the spring of 2022. Throughout attending couples therapy all of last year and truly putting an effort on my end, listening to his needs and wants etc. He continued to put no effort himself. He would say he wanted things like physical affection, yet I always made a point to try and he wouldn't give any in return, he was a stiff board with no affection towards me. Told me he wanted to have sex, ok...so I initiated, but he never initiated himself, not even once in over a year. He said he physically cannot initiate sex with me because he had been \"shut down\" too many times in the past (before we tried therapy). When he says \"shut down\"...his attempts to initiate sex would be asking me if I wanted to \"get it in\"...and that didn't really make me excited, or I'd legitimately just not be in the mood for sex. He stopped sleeping in our marital bed back in 2021, and blamed it on the fact that he didn\u2019t want to sleep with his CPAP (he snores) but I never told him to not sleep with me. And as a matter of fact, during couples therapy I kept encouraging him to sleep with me in our bedroom so we could have \"pillow talk\" and get our connection back. He never followed through. \n\nThe straw that broke the camels back was the fact that he continues to tell me that he wants to have a baby but his actions have shown me he isn't willing to put the work and effort into \"us\" first and foremost. I need to feel secure, supported and loved. I've been so incredibly angry and bitter about it all. I was so patient with him while he went to school for his dream job, and now it's as if I was just expected to child rear for him and nothing more.

He\u2019s working on himself and I can see all the effort he\u2019s putting into this. But my emotions are gone.

I keep getting symptom treatments that aren\u2019t effective.  My primary care doc of the last 10+ years is going through some difficult family and career stuff, and hasn\u2019t been able to be appropriately responsive.

I\u2019ve been telling providers at frequent drs appointments for 9 months now and the most response I\u2019ve gotten is a couple blood panels, which showed a ferriton of 10 (too low, good level is around 100).  They recommended an iron supplement.  It has barely helped. I get lots of comments about \u201ccould be xyz, have you tried abc?\u201d And then either the abc is something I\u2019m already doing, can\u2019t do, or helps but doesn\u2019t help *enough*\n\nI wake up most days more tired and exhausted than when I went to sleep, disoriented, achy and in pain. My joints hurt every day. A typical for me workout now leaves me feeling like I did a workout that was 4x as hard or long or big than what I actually did.  My ADHD symptoms have gone from mild-moderate (all my life) to life ruiningly  bad - my career is in the pits, my financial credit is under threat, and I\u2019m incredibly socially isolated (down from a thriving social life the previous year). My digestive system is so fucked up - I spend half my days bloated and distended to the point of pain and even after making the switch to a mostly FODMAP-safe diet I still can barely eat without my GI track punishing me. I can eat chocolate (\ud83d\ude44) without bloating so I end up eating it all freaking day, which feels super disgusting in a different way.  I\u2019m gaining weight so I\u2019m told nothing is wrong with my GI, it\u2019s just \u201cfunctional\u201d problems.  I get bloated if I eat healthy carbs, but nauseous if I eat anything fatty, and if I don\u2019t take a bunch of anti-nausea medication right away, I might end up having a really scary episode of GI pain and vomiting - folks who have witnessed it freak out and start talking about if they should take me to the ER.  Plus a whole bunch of other symptoms. I\u2019m having really weird discomfort under my left rib and the only way to relieve it is to hang upside down or to physically scoop and lift my ribs up and away from my body: this \u201cmakes space\u201d for whatever is wrong to expand. I can\u2019t think through the sense of \u201cwrongness\u201d. \n\nThe weird thing is that despite my body feeling like something I am trapped in and having to endure, my mental health is kinda ok. I\u2019m not depressed or sad or hopeless, except for when I think about how hard it is to get anyone to understand how much my body is breaking apart and ruining my life :\/  I\u2019m on medical leave, but my Dr is treating it like a \u201cbreak from work\u201d instead of doing tests or making referrals.

I'm 33 yo and all my life I've been focussed on setting myself up financially, which has meant spending very little on my clothing and overall physical appearance. (For example, prior to this experience I did not own a pair of jeans - I just had my work uniform and a couple of pairs of tracksuit pants. All my shirts were hand-me-downs from my stepdad or grandma. I looked terrible and I rarely socialised outside work). Also, I tend to lack confidence, so a lot of the time I have avoided dressing up because I didn't think it was possible for me to look pretty.\n\nFast forward to my 30s, I'm in a good financial position and feeling more confident. I've decided that my lack of clothing is really holding me back, so I'm working on putting together a capsule wardrobe. I'm starting from scratch, meaning that I have already spent a lot of money, particularly on coats and boots. I have bought a lot of lot of classic pieces as second hand designer items - I have the intention of maintaining and owning these for decades. My goal is to purchase classic items that will be easy to mix and match and will \"spark joy\" because of their style and high quality.\n\nI can't shake the feeling however that this is wrong. I was raised to believe that women who spent large amounts of money on clothes or were interested in fashion were shallow. Does anyone else suffer from this kind of guilt?\n\nEven though I have spent quite a lot of money (nothing that has bankrupted me, but we are talking in the thousands - I figured that the average woman spends about 1k a year and I have some catching up to do) so far, it has been in classic pieces, many of which I have dreamed of owning for YEARS and intend to own for years. I am not splurging on Uber trendy impulse purchases, and as I said a lot of what I am buying is second hand, and yet I'm still struggling to feel okay about it...","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678638124.0},{"title":"Forced myself out of my comfort zone today & went to the gym and my anxiety is now through the roof.","author":"RUsername01012023","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11ox306\/forced_myself_out_of_my_comfort_zone_today_went\/","text":"Vent?

I have never been attracted to a typical 'nerdy' guy. I intentionally decided to 'branch out' and chat with him with texting, knowing based on his profile that he wasn't my 'type'. In person, there were some jokes\/mannerisms that were just too dorky and put me off a bit. Has anyone had an experience like this?\n\nI'm worried about doing my typical people-pleasing thing and just agreeing to go on another date without really being into it because I'm afraid of hurting the other person's feelings.

We were each other's first loves and went through many of life's milestones together, eventually getting engaged and buying a house.\n\nHowever he always had anger issues and eventually these caused me to end the relationship due to him shouting at me, giving me silent treatment, name calling over petty disagreements and issues. I tried to resolve these but he refused any counselling or help. I myself suffer from fairly severe anxiety and I found the relationship triggered this badly, for example having a week long panic attack at one point due partly to the silent treatment from him.\n\nWe broke up about a year and a half ago and since then I have been living with my parents temporarily saving for a deposit on a flat and now very close to buying something of my own. I have done online dating for the last half a year however this has been pretty disappointing and hasn't led to anything good.\n\nThe thing is I am constantly now doubting my decision to end the relationship and thinking back to many of the happy times we shared. It's almost like I can't imagine a life ahead of me without him ever being a part of it despite the pain he caused me.\n\nAt the end of the relationship I left our house and moved back with my parents and haven't seen him since although he has reached out to me on numerous occasions and is still keen to get back together. I found it unbearable to say a final goodbye though have made it clear that we are no longer in a relationship.\n\nHow do I move past this?

I\u2019m an introvert, and have a lot of medical issues, and I moved a few months ago so I don\u2019t see my friends often.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve been hesitating to plan something because every idea I come up with seems inconsiderate. I\u2019ve been mulling over this for a month now, not knowing what to do, and at this point my birthday is only 3 weeks away (April 1) which I realize leaves even less time for my friends to plan.\n\n1. My first idea was a girl\u2019s night. I think that would be loads of fun. I\u2019d get food and drinks and pot and we could watch movies, listen to music, paint, chat, just have a good time. And several friends have mentioned wanting to visit me where I live now. \n\nThe thing is, I work weekends and I only requested off Saturday (the day of my birthday). I didn\u2019t think about the Sunday until just now. Friday night would be perfect for me, but seems like it might be difficult for my friends (particularly those with regular work schedules and\/or kids) because I live two hours away. The ones who said they want to visit me might not mind, and most don\u2019t have traditional work schedules either, but the ones who haven\u2019t mentioned wanting to visit\u2026how can I even ask them to make the drive? \nAnd then those with kids, Friday night seems terrible. \n\nBut I know I can\u2019t stay up all night Saturday carrying on, and then get up for work to be on the next day at 8am. Unless it was like a Saturday party ending at midnight? (Of course I would have sleeping accommodations) \n\n2. I have wanted to do a proper English tea for a long time! I thought it would be nice to invite a couple friends, but again, the distance. I could make the reservation for Saturday, but the closest tea places would be an hour and a half drive for them. (For me too, which is fine)\n\n3. Rage room. I definitely want to do this, birthday or not. I found ones nearby where most of my friends live, and I found ones where it would be about an hour drive for all of us. But then I thought, I can\u2019t afford a rage room for everyone. \n\nWhen I looked online for etiquette for paying for birthday stuff, I found a whole range of answers from: if you can\u2019t afford to pay for everyone then you shouldn\u2019t be doing an activity for your birthday, to: just tell people they will have to pay for themselves upfront. \n\nI mean, rage room would be hundreds of dollars and I just personally can\u2019t afford that. $100 minimum for two people, one session. I could do that. I would want to invite 6 people, so plus me that\u2019s 7. I can\u2019t afford that. \n\nIs it really bad to say hey I\u2019d love to share this experience with you all, we\u2019re all paying for our own entry fee, let me know if you can make it! \nOne person online said that is rude and tacky. I don\u2019t want to be rude and tacky. \n\nBut other people said it\u2019s not a big deal. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a cultural thing?\n\nI have never done this before as an adult, meaning spent my birthday with friends. Last time I did that I was a teenager. I\u2019ll be turning 33.\n\n\nAlso, my husband asked me if I would like to spend the day with him or if he could join in if I do something with my family. I really don\u2019t want to spend the day with him or my family. Oh no. I\u2019m trying to have a good time, not feel bad. For context, we have been living separately for 2 years, and have had very low contact with each other for over a year now. I did say yes to him coming over for my birthday last year. It was weird. I don\u2019t want to do that this year. I\u2019m much happier and doing better in my life and want to spend the day with people who bring me joy. \n\nThanks for insight here.

I felt it for a while, and it got to me emotionally and physically, so I apologize for this vent intro part, I\u2019m still kind of a mess and don\u2019t currently have a therapist or much support. Some context, it was a 2.5+ year \u201cpartnership\u201d that never fully felt like a partnership, but was 95% positive and wonderful until I confirmed last summer he was romantically texting his ex through our entire relationship, as I suspected but was reassured (gaslit?) I was wrong often. From that point, to stay together I asked for more security and to become officially bf\/gf, asked to just see each other more than once every week or so, and asked him why he posts his friends on his social media but never me after years together, not even in stories. He said he didn\u2019t like labels and was just busy and also had no excuse for the social media thing. He called us partners, but we never really ran errands, hiked, worked out, got groceries, walked my dog, cooked, etc. let alone small trips\/travel, despite basically begging for all these things that should come easily. He never offered to watch my dog or help me with house stuff or if he offered it was hypothetical about a \u201cnext time\u201d that never came. I told him from the start there is no pressure about marriage or kids (still undecided about both), but my one want is someone to do some life stuff with. I do a TON alone and love it, but I want to occasionally share things too. As of last night we hadn\u2019t hung out in three weeks. I\u2019ve never felt less interesting or cool\u2026even though I am. To have to beg someone to hang out with me is so sad. His ex would also happen to pop up where she knew he\u2019d be, and it really triggered my insecurities having being cheated on in the past, but I mostly kept silent to keep peace. \n\nWe stayed together until last night, and my self esteem and self worth is at rock bottom. As a result, I don\u2019t feel hot anymore or beautiful. I have my moments, but I\u2019m not conventionally attractive at all, which feels glaringly obvious now in this harsh breakup lighting. I was his secret he was ashamed of showing people which I shared with him was a huge issue I had with my last 2 exes. I gained 18lbs since October, and my clothes don\u2019t fit. I also have a very high-stress job on top of being a personal wreck, so I\u2019ve been dreaming of a low stress job, but also realize that could be a bad decision and I would get FOMO if I left. I\u2019m biting my cheeks and have migraines daily from stress, and I also looked at a few houses thinking about selling my place for somewhere else with new projects and scenery or maybe across the country? It\u2019s like an identity crisis. When things are in an unsettled state, I feel like the rugs been ripped out from under me and tend to spiral and want to scrap everything about me and start over which sounds great, but obviously realistically could be awful and the opposite of what is needed. \n\nTL;DR Long story long (thanks to those who read the rambling drama), what are some \u201csafe\u201d decisions and changes that can be made and are less likely to cause more feel-awful in the future after breakups?

It\u2019s been a month and only got two interviews. My confidence is so shot and when going into applications, answering employer phone calls and going into interviews I can feel my lips quiver in crippling anxiety. I do want to disclose that I have PTSD (complex) and have worked hard to reduce the symptoms in my adult life. But it has never affected my professional confidence or my ability to rock an interview. Now I\u2019m finding myself tossing and turning at night and I don\u2019t know where I got lost in this. \n\n\nWhat is wrong with me? Where has my confidence gone? Why do I feel that all these older women who are in my profession aren\u2019t being supportive? It\u2019s making me feel that I\u2019m better off staying where I\u2019m at.

I didn\u2019t dispute any transactions. There was NO fraud.

The short version is very few places had an ounce of sympathy and have treated me like a person who intentionally committed fraud.\n\nWhile they have reversed it finally (a month after my entire life was impacted) I\u2019m still being greatly impacted.

E.G., conversations you wish you\u2019d had before you moved in, married, etc.**\n\n**And\/or: Does anyone have stories about taking a leap of faith in a relationship? How did that turn out?**\n\nI think I\u2019m mostly hoping to enjoy some shared anecdotes and group wisdom, but here\u2019s my personal context for those interested:\n\nI (34F) am considering taking a bit of a leap of faith in my current relationship to move in together and move to a new city together simultaneously after a bit less than a year of dating (though it might be a year or more by the time we do this). \n\nMy partner (31M) has reached a big transitional moment in his working life and needs to leave his current position asap and start applying to other jobs in his field. There are a variety of conditions that are making his current role extremely stressful, and make this a very sensible time for him to seek greener pastures. There are no good local opportunities for him currently, so he will likely have to move, possibly to another state. This has cropped up pretty suddenly (his supervisor and counterpart both left without much warning), and we\u2019ve both been overwhelmed, sad, and trying to process what this means for us.\n\nI\u2019ve dated quite a bit in my life so far, and have been in a variety of different LTRs. I\u2019ve also done a good amount of therapy, and have spent time reflecting on how those relationships have affected me, how I show up in them, etc. I decided a while ago that I don\u2019t really give a shit about my personal career success (I have to keep a roof over my head, but have other priorities\u2014mental health, building chosen family, personal growth, pursuing hobbies and creative pursuits, etc), but it also feels weird to wrap my brain around being a \u2018trailing spouse\u2019, and to make such a big jump all at once.\n\nOur relationship hasn\u2019t been without challenges, but all in all, we talk about our issues really well and he\u2019s been the best partner I\u2019ve ever had so far. (A constantly rising bar.) I moved to my current community a year and a half ago, and I don\u2019t have deep ties here yet, though I do like my life and job. Still\u2014I love this guy and I guess I\u2019m not ready to end the relationship over a move. In my heart of hearts, I think I want to see where this thing goes, and maybe I\u2019m still a little more adventurous than I\u2019d realized.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve started having ongoing conversations about this and are exploring the idea of not breaking up over it. Most likely, this would mean that I would move with him. We don\u2019t currently live together, and because we live in a rural area in neighboring towns, we\u2019ve typically only been able to spend a night or two together each week for the last 10 months, when neither of us have been traveling. We do talk every day, throughout the day, but this would be a big change.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678387428.0},{"title":"Jimmy Kimmel is hosting the Oscars.

No offense to the husbands\/partners who are usually lovely and interesting people, but the thought of trying to get to know someone while their partner is present and forced upon me as a friend is strange to me. If I ask a woman to grab a quick coffee sometime as a potential entry point into a friendship between us, I don't know why this is seen as an open invitation to her spouse into my social life, and to both her and her spouse into my partner's social life.\n\nAnd it's not a blanket rule as it does depend on the couple. There are some couples who each have separate friends and bring them together for gatherings and so you'll mostly always end up socialising with them as a couple, but because it's a group of people it's not a couple date and I'm not exactly forced to get to know their partner on a deeper level.\n\nBut I've noticed the types who try to implement couple-dates straight away seem not to have much in terms of a social life outside of their partners.\n\nWomen who do this, I'm seeking to understand. Do you have more fun while on couple dates? Do you have social anxiety and would like to have your partner as a support? Are you limited by time and social time is the only time you get to spend with your SO? Is your SO your best friend and you can't imagine a social life without them?\n\nP.S. I am not talking about couples with children. That is a point where the rules have to go out the window. I'm talking about women with no children who don't want to make friends without their partner being part of it.\n\nEdit to add: I've also noticed some women do this because their husbands have no friends and they want their husbands to have friends, as though my partner and I are just going to spend the limited social lives we have on someone we never chose because his wife feels sorry for him.

SD said to her that it's the only to get C to listen. I said to B, is C still naughty after she gets hit? And B said yes. So I said, see it doesn't work and you should never hit kids. B agreed. We told her to tell us if he ever hits her because it's not ok and Dad will make sure it stops.\nMy husband and I were really upset and couldn't understand how his ex could let this happen.

Yesterday B told her Dad that SD is now hitting C with a belt and putting her in a dark room for timeout.

I was almost 30 and I was SO excited, happy, optimistic, etc. at the time. Looking back, it was like I was a completely different person. Well, a lot happened in those 10 years, and I see now how I was conditioned to be an overly naive and optimistic person due to trauma, which opened me up to very manipulative people and bad situations where I ignored red flags. \n\nObviously, I've learned a lot, grown, and I've done a lot of work. I'll admit I've looked to jobs, friends, and relationships as saviors, but I think I've finally, finally learned my lesson. Well, now I'm back in City A, and I wish I had some optimism, but I don't.

I have made some new friends, but I'm honestly at a loss of how to nurture these relationships going forward. \n\nI'll admit, I'm in a dark mood.

We were good friends for long before that having met in 2006. We were finally able to purchase our first home together last year, after years and years of saving for a deposit and getting our careers\/lives in order to obtain a mortgage.\n\nSince the very beginning I've been very, VERY upfront about not wanting children and it being very unlikely to change. S\/O agreed saying that he didn't want them either.\n\nHe revealed to me tonight that the reason he's been so down and depressed lately (he's been a fairly negative person ever since I've known him, but it has been worse recently) is because he's realised that he really DOES want kids. His sister and partner are expecting, and he's been worse since their reveal.\n\nI truly don't see myself budging on this issue; I've explained to him that I'd more than understand if he wanted to go separate ways to pursue a partner who shared the same life goals, but he said he'd want it to be with me or no-one. I asked theoretically if he would ever consider fostering (just to try and understand what he wanted) but he said no, biological or nothing. He said he felt he had no reason to exist and was just 'waiting to die'. I personally disagree with having children just to fulfill a 'purpose', but I didn't bring it up for fear of being tactless or blunt.\n\nI'm now thinking 'shit'. Here comes a lifetime of his sulking and resentment towards me. Although I truly do feel for him, me having kids just to appease him is absolutely out of the question, so I guess I'm just going to try and enjoy the ride and life as it comes? It's no-one's fault of course, people change and so do their goals and ideals.\n\nI just feel so alone about it all and wanted to get it off my chest having no-one to talk to about it. Has anyone else ever dealt with this sort of thing?\n\n  \n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nEDIT: I just wanted to say thank you so, so much to every single person who commented their thoughts, advice and experiences <3 (My apologies that I haven't replied to everybody, but please know that I thoroughly read and took on board every single comment).  \n\n\n(I ugly cried while eating my Fruit Loops before work this morning a couple of times reading, haha!)  \n\n\nI spoke to my S\/O this evening when I got home. We had a long talk and I've given him the ultimatum of individual therapy to start with, to get to the root of his (what I suspect to be) depression. I'll be getting it too as I have a whole mess of things to unpack...and we'll reassess his desire for kids once his personal issues are more addressed. We can progress to couples therapy if need be from there, but it's a starting point.  \n\n\nHe iterated again that he would ONLY want children with me, but that he loves me enough to 'NOT' want them...I explained that it would still be wrong of him to compromise on something like this, so we'll assess down the line if it truly is a phase or if he's serious (AFTER therapy and AFTER his sister's baby is born, when a slice of the gritty reality hits!!)   \n\n\nObviously it will be the end of our relationship if it's a genuine urge, but I feel (hope!) it would be an amicable split. We'll cross that bridge if and when it comes to it...  \n\n\nThank you all so much again, this post and your replies really did give me confidence and that I wasn't completely alone.

So, I started reading about it, finding free courses and articles, and started practicing.

I know what you're thinking... gross, he doesn't shower or has bad hygiene.  Nope.  He showers every day.  He uses soap every day.  (I see the soap disappearing and I'm the one who buys it, so I know it's being used, and he smells like the soap after the shower).  He doesn't smell.  He washes his hair.  When he's particularly sweaty, he'll take a second shower before getting into bed. \n\nBut, week after week, month after month, a man-sized orange stain appears in the sheets, on his side.  I have to completely saturate the stain with pre-treater before washing it, and it only partly comes out.  So, his side of the bed always has an orange tint.  It even soaks down into the mattress cover.  \n\nIt doesn't smell or anything - at least, not any more than normal sheets do after people have laid in them for a few days.

Why am I more sad about this breakup than other breakups in relationships that were much happier and healthier?**\n\nI (33F) broke up with my boyfriend (35M) about 10 days ago. We still live together, but he's moving out this week. We only dated for 10-11 months (lived together for 4). It was the shortest and most challenging relationship I've been in. There were obviously a lot of joyful moments, vacations together, similar interests, support, tons of affection, etc that kept the relationship going...\n\n...but there was also so much pain and anxiety. He is one of the most emotionally avoidant and dismissive people I've dated and rarely took any accountability for his hurtful actions. He could lose his temper and shout at me and be very defensive and hypocritical. He had an abusive childhood and hasn't done much to heal it -- I felt that he'd project a lot of his unhealed wounds onto me. The relationship definitely dimmed my light. I also used to lean more \"secure\" in attachment after years of therapy and self-work, but this relationship seemed to undo a lot of it and I reverted back to a lot more anxiety. For all of these reasons and more, I decided to end things.\n\nIf I compare this to my other recent relationships before him, which were each 2-3 years long (also lived together), those relationships were generally very healthy and had an undertone of friendship and compassion, even through hard times. I don't feel that either of those partners were very avoidant, and we were able to work through conflict healthily. In the end we just weren't romantically compatible (to me) and I felt \"healed\" from those breakups very quickly -- I was genuinely only sad for a few days and then mostly just felt relieved that they were over.\n\nBut with this current breakup, I am feeling more sad than I've ever felt post-breakup, even though I ended it because I know this relationship is wrong for me for so many reasons. Am I so sad because the relationship made me feel so diminished and invalidated, whereas my other relationships lifted my soul and never made me feel like a \"bad person\"? Or am I sad because my ex-partner seems mostly unphased about the breakup due to his emotional avoidance (even though he's told me that he's devastated deep down and has never known how to access painful emotions in the moment), which makes me feel like he doesn't care about me? Am I sad because I was more attracted to him than anyone else I've been in a long-term relationship with? \n\nI think I'm just scared because I've never actually been very sad after a breakup, and it's scary to experience the prolonged pain of one for the first time. I know that no one here can give me a definitive answer, but would love to hear if anyone has had a similar experience.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678110242.0},{"title":"Does anyone genuinely get endorphins from exercise?","author":"chiefmilkshake","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11izs6r\/does_anyone_genuinely_get_endorphins_from_exercise\/","text":"I ask because I've been exercising at various degrees for 20 years and genuinely feel no mood improvement from exercise.

We\u2019ve been together for almost two years and have a very happy relationship, so much so that we are thinking of getting engaged next year :)\n\nHowever, our sex life has been taking a hit in the last six months. If it\u2019s not an \u201cI\u2019m too tired\u201d, then it\u2019s a \u201cI\u2019m too stressed\u201d response from either myself or him. I\u2019m usually the one who says that I\u2019m too tired and for very good reason - he has a tendency to initiate when we go to bed to *sleep*. If I\u2019m going to bed to sleep, I\u2019m too sleepy! I\u2019ve told him this already and find it a bit lazy to initiate at this time.\n\nThe \u201cI\u2019m too stressed\u201d comes from him and either happens if I initiate or ten minutes into active intimacy. I\u2019ve always been supportive when this happens. It ends up as a personal therapy session for him where he tells me how work is stressing him out and how work becomes an invasive thought during intimacy. Then he works through those stressors and feels better while I feel worse (exhausted that I\u2019m shouldering my own stress and his).\n\nI\u2019ve given up on initiating as the rejection really deflates my confidence and when he loses his mood during intimacy I\u2019m starting to resent hearing about his work stress. Maybe this sounds cold, but he\u2019s got a regular 9-6 job and deals with annoying contractors the same way I deal with annoying clients. We haven\u2019t got a mortgage, we haven\u2019t got money problems or serious health issues, we have loving supportive families and lovely friends. We have no children or pets. What would our sex life be like if we did have these things on top of it all? Probably wouldn\u2019t be having sex anymore\u2026\n\nI have no problem with occasionally being stressed, but I definitely think that with the frequency he is experiencing it that he\u2019s got to do something about it.

He also agrees and I can see where he\u2019s coming from - work has got him so stressed that the idea of having to do something to destress is stressful. \n\nTyping this out makes me feel a mixture of sympathy, frustration, stress, and resentment. It\u2019s not even about our sex life really, moreso about mental health and stress management.

Just to preface *I do have a history of anxiety and depression since a young age,  also very likely have ADHD.* **I have been doing therapy since college-which has been over 10 years now.** It helps to an extent, but I feel like I can only do so much to not feel upset by the way life has gone for over the course of the past few years.\n\nAfter I turned 30, I realized that I feel like it's so unbelievably easy to feel forgotten. Like as if I don't exist. I deleted my social media last year-instagram and twitter for a long period and while that helped to an extent to help me let go of my impulse to scroll\/post, I went weeks (nearly months) with zero interaction with people my age. No texts. No \"hey how are you\" or \"I was thinking about you\". I'm the one who always intiates first, who starts conversations first, who texts people who I haven't heard from in years. I've used bff apps and feel like 99% of the time, if I'm not driving the convo, it will dissapate.\n\nI came back to social media to mostly to follow events in my area and have been a part of a community initiative that happens every month that's been somewhat fun. I also go to events\/socialize wherever possible. I make plans with people I know, even if they feel like acquaintences at best. But whenever I meet new people, I feel like it's very passive. I know that making friends in 30s is hard, but it's hard to come to terms with this reality while not having an existing social circle that I feel a part of-most people I know have this by virtue of growing up in the same place or living in the same place where their parents\/grandparents\/generations have settled. I've never had that b\/c I moved throughout 11 cities\/towns throughout my life due to various life circumstances. I'm also a minority and my parents are immigrants, so there are very few places in US where I feel alright to live in without constant microaggressions that I've faced in my twenties that literally costed me job opportunities and set me far back in my career that I'm working so hard to overcome now in my thirties.\n\nI know so many people as a result of moving but I exist in the background or not at all b\/c they have everything they need in terms of social support and actually even blatantly say \"I don't want to make new friends\". The few people I know in life who wanted a change and try something new moved to the city I currently live in-a major metropolitan area that I grew up in for a few years and kept visiting every year or so and now have lived here on my own for four years. I live in the more ethnically diverse part of the city whereas most people I know who moved live in the sort of luxury apartments and kind of are invested in doing the bougie city things that you see on the TV shows lol. No hate-to each their own, but I feel frustrated that even a good childhood friend who was my college roommate for so many years moved and in the timespan of 6 months **has hung out only twice** and is always posting everyday the things they're doing in the city that they literally can invite me too b\/c I'm just a few train stops down but don't.\n\nI once confronted her how I feel left out and she felt bad so invited me out the next day but afterwards just has been doing her own thing with her other friend who moved from the same hometown. There've been a few other people I know who moved all the way from the other side of the country to this city and I got in touch with them immediately to tell them we should hang out and some of my fav things in the city that \"we should go to\" and saw on social media they went to all these places with friends they somehow managed to make in a short span of time without me.\n\nI honestly feel like such a loser. Where did I go wrong? I have felt this for years, but it feels like....if I looked differently, was more conventionally attractive, fashionable or had a \"wow\" factor, I'd be more accepted. I self-introspect a lot and do therapy and am always confronting where I can be a better person but I do feel I've always **strived hard to be a better friend to people than people have been to me.** I always listen to people when they have problems or help people when they need help. Heck, I helped a girl I just met on a friends app get a job through one of my connections. I do reach out to people and do my part to make initiatives, but nothing sticks. I've recently seen on social media how girls say stuff like \"omg I love complimenting a pretty girl and becoming friends with her\" n while I get that....it feels so painfully clear that beauty is such a strong factor for both heterosexual romantic relationships and even female friendships. I feel so set back being average looking even though I have so many exciting hobbies\/interests I'd love to share with people.\n\nThe only thing that is helping abate the crippling loneliness is that I'm creative minded and have tons of hobbies. I also attend almost every random event in my area, sometimes through the local library or other initiatives in the area. I don't feel like the people I meet are \"friends\" per se but I'm a familiar face and treated with respect. I love trying new things even if it's solo.\n\nI'm single too, an only child and WFH in a career I don't love-the latter which I think is also has been contributing to my depression. I've tried dating apps and REALLY have done my best, but I hardly get matches or when I do-it's always guys who either instantly unmatch me after following or are always waiting for me to keep the convo going rather than express an interest in asking questions\/getting to know me. I know romantic parternship works easily for some, but it's been even more challenging than friendships for me. Idk, I feel like I'm in a timeline where everybody has found a place where they feel they belong whereas I'm scrambling to find my place-like it feels like when we were in grade school and got to pick our own partners and there was always somebody at the end who couldn't find a group to pair up with. I didn't realize this is how I'd feel as an adult women in her thirties lmao.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678047609.0},{"title":"Woman, what do you look for in a guy over 30?

I brought my parents out for dinner tonight. Came to about $130\/ 110euro, nothing crazy but it was a pretty casual place. After I paid the bill the three of us chatted about inflation a bit and my mum said '$130 is nothing really' and then my dad started to talk about how much he had to pay for my school fees over the years i.e. when i was in fee paying primary \/ secondary school from 4 - 18. It was boarding school, so i was only home at the weekends. Hes very self involved, has a lot of hangups and the older i get, i see hes just human so i try to overlook a lot of it but f\\*ck me, im only human and sometimes i feel like, what the hell is the point of me even trying. He drinks a LOT to cope with life. He had like 5 glasses of wine in less than an hour at dinner, and is slightly hammered all the time. I said im paying for dinner but you can get your wine, cause im not funding his alcoholism and he said 'i wouldnt have bothered coming then... and gave me a death stare. My mom then said hes joking and to 'relax' but he wasn't joking and even if he was, thats not funny. I'm 32 (nearly 33) , I feel like he treated me like shit my whole life. Now I'm older, why do i have to put up with this?\n\nGrowing up he sometimes would say to me how i didn't for him, nothing but take from him. Even when i was like 13 years old and couldn't work. He's a major asshole a lot of the time. I have taken care of myself my entire life and never ever asked for anthing. Aside from paying my school fees he and my mom gave me nothing. I was in a fee paying school with no money for anything outside of school and constantly got in thrown in my face by him. I didn't ask to me born. My mum just defends him the whole time and tells me to not make a deal out of anything as wants to keep the peace, her stress tolerance is low and her health is kind of shaky right now (which is another worry).\n\nI recently bought my own house, solo without any help from anyone lease of him from my family.

Little things. I feel like I'm relatively generous. Tonight i said ill take us out to dinner.

Major ones include: putting me through major surgery in an extremely short timeframe with no emotional support, and it could have waited months later until summer; yelling at me to get out of the house when I visited after an internship and before going back to college; not attending piano recitals because he didn't like them; icing me out throughout my PhD because I wasn't done yet; not eating a meal my husband and I prepared for them on vacation (cooking used to be a bonding experience and is something I am proud of)...the list could go on and on. \n\nTo boot, he is an anti vaxxer and Trumper.  He is racist and sexist though he couches it in humor and charm.  I grew up listening to Rush Limbaugh and I am only recently realizing how messed up that was.  \n\nThe backstory to this is that he did not attend my first wedding (my mom did).  Obviously I was divorced, which was very painful to go through, which my parents provided zero support on, and I am very grateful to have met my spouse.  I know now that my parents didn't approve of my ex husband, and they do approve of my husband (he is an amazing person!).   \n\nSo, I am done.  I have no interest in talking to him again, as a way of protecting myself.  My problem is, oddly enough, my husband.  He is in contact with my father.  I can't tell him who he can and cannot be friends with, but it definitely hurts me that my father chooses to talk to him and not to me.  My husband has a great and healthy family life, and he cannot understand what it was like for me.  I think my father talks to him because it's pleasant and there is no bad feeling.  To make it even more fun for me, my husband's parents do not speak much English and I don't speak much of their language (I am learning slowly, but it is hard when also working a full time job).  So I cannot interact with them at a deep level.\n\nI don't want my husband to suggest we visit my parents again (they live across the country).  I was uncomfortable taking a photo at Christmas to send them.  I don't want to know what he and my father talk about.  I don't want to know when they talk.  I want to heal, on my own, from a lifetime of not having a healthy relationship with my parents, especially my father.  I want to accept that my loving mother enables this, and move on from that, too.  \n\nSo, how do I handle this with my husband? What is and is not reasonable to ask? How do I communicate this?  We have excellent communication so I am not worried about having the conversation.  I just need help defining the points for myself, please.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678037546.0},{"title":"\"If he likes you, you'll no and if he doesn't you'll be confused\".

A few months ago, I moved in to help him with keeping up the house\/caring for his 4 pets\/being there for him as needed since he was having trouble. And just so that people don't think I'm trying to take advantage of him: He didn't want rent, so instead I took over all the household bills. Internet, electricity, water, gas, groceries, pet care, etc.\n\nHe's doing mostly okay. He can still drive himself to chemo and will be up to putter about in the mornings, but the rest of the day is spent in bed. And there are more and more days where he isn't up to getting out of bed at all.\n\nThe thing is though that he doesn't think he's terminally ill. It's not that he's being stoic or optimistic. He really 100% thinks that he will get better. When he declares something, it becomes law and that's just the way things are regardless of any other circumstances. He also doesn't understand conversations with doctors or test results, so he wouldn't find out through that. He sort of blocks it out and then waits for the instructions part.\n\nAnd that's fine! If that's how he deals with things, then it's completely his business. I never, ever contradict him or allude to it being terminal. But from a medical perspective, it's definitely terminal and while they obviously can't say for sure, most likely within the year. The chemo is palliative rather than curative.\n\nThe problem though is that now I don't know how to handle or broach difficult subjects. Things like what he wants his end of life care to look like, what he wants done with his ashes, etc. I want to respect his wishes about not alluding to things being terminal, but eventually there's going to come a point where the talks can't wait any longer. \n\nWhat would be the best way to handle these topics?

During that time, few of our mutual friends have ceased being friends with her. In the past year, there are certain things I have noticed that just aren't adding up about her history, values, and character, which is interesting because she often speaks about how \"important\" people's values and character are.\n\n The following things have given me pause:\n\n\\- Lying about previous jobs. For example, she used to work for a debt collection agency as a debt collector (I found out from a mutual friend who actually worked under her when she was his team leader) but she told me that she worked for a bank, \"helping people\" who couldn't pay back their loans. Mutual friend said this is a complete fabrication, that their team was calling up elderly people who were homeless and harrassing them for money THEY loaned to them in the first place. I don't know if she feels shame\/embarrassment for working at a place like that - I mean, most of us have had shitty jobs in the past- but her need to lie about it is odd. She was also at this place for ten years.\n\n\\- For years, she lived off income protection after leaving the above role for undisclosed reasons. Mutual friends think this was premeditated and she was 'faking' the claims so to speak, particularly as the doctor signing the claims off was her uncle. She would often say she was sick but then be caught out in public going for brunches, shopping, etc.\n\n\\- Can be very self-righteous and pious. She stopped talking to a friend who had two abortions because she thought she was being \"reckless.\" She is a big 'free speech' promoter and thinks Kanye should be allowed to say what he says, for example, but is quick to cut people off when she doesn't agree with their behaviour. Also, when we go out, she makes religious comments that can be annoying, for example, she will \"pray\" to God to find her a parking spot and then go on about how God \"looked down on her with favour\" when she finds a spot. Last time I challenged her on this (God prioritises your car spot over starving children?) and she got a bit annoyed.\n\n\\- Entitled attitude at times. For example, she stopped talking to her cousins as they didn't want to pick her up from the station after work a couple of times per week (because she didn't want to park her car at the station as her car was too expensive). She can be rude to customer service staff too.\n\n\\- Often cancels plans last minute, sometimes for no good reason. The last plans we had, she cancelled because \"she wasn't feeling upto it.\"\n\nThe confusing thing about all of the above is that she is very, very nice in person to me but hearing and seeing these things has given me pause.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1677974790.0},{"title":"Where do you buy your panties\/bras?","author":"JennRed","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11ioc8g\/where_do_you_buy_your_pantiesbras\/","text":"I've been buying from the same place for the last decade and I feel like I may be missing out on something better.

Are they blurring together their twenties and thirties and mixing them into one category because it's been so long? (Like we might with the ages of 7 and 8.) Or are \"twenties\" a term to mean \"general youth\" and not the literal ages of 20-29?

How to deal with this?","author":"Thrrowjane","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11itnqt\/still_struggling_with_experience_of_seeing_some\/","text":"Forgive me, but my mind is all over. \n\n\nFirst and foremost though, I know that it is 100% the fault of patriarchal system. Because patriarchy and conservatism were the base of society where I am from. \n\n\nI came from one of those places which was famous for... \"Mummy's sons.\" And seeing the process of that growing up, witnessing it first hand with my own eyes, have done a lot of horrible things to my mind. \n\n\nI think one of the biggest fear was to turn into such women. I am childfree by choice and I am profiting and enjoying the results of that choice, but I will be lying if I do not admit that some parts of it must have come from how my mother raised my brother. \n\n\nOne of earliest memories was seeing my mother coercing my brother (he was 2 then), to embraced her back while she was sitting on the floor and read newspaper. She kept on egging him by telling him that she was going to give him out to neighbors if he refused to show that he 'loved mommy' by clinging into her and crying \"where is mommy? I want my mommy.\"\n\n\nIn hindsight, I think my mother wanted a husband who embraced her and tells her that he wants\/needs\/loves her...but she was too proud to do so. Because in our conservative society, a woman wanting affection (especially physical) from men are weak minded and have whores traits. Sex are supposed to be for procreation only and women only supposed to endure that to get ultimate happiness in form of raising children. A woman who is physically affectionate has something to hide from her past or her psyche... That was what I was told. And again, I am very aware that it was patriarchal system and conservatism doing that. \n\n\nMy brother grew up and is still fucked up from it. He played our mother's perfect husband figure sans the sex for too long...to be able to defend his wife from our mother without him feeling a ton of guilt. \n\n\nHis wife experienced the same upbringing as mine. Sis in law's brother is to this day, still play husband figure sans sex to his mother. Neglecting his own wife and two children. \n\n\n...and thus how the circle continued. The neglected wife and mother then go on to create her own version of perfect husband sans sex through her son. \n\n\nI have been talking more to my brother and sister in law lately, have come to re-establishing contacts with former high school friends (men and women) and they grew up experiencing the same trauma...and some are even still living in it (just like my sis in law's sis in law). \n\n\nAnd I see some of them re-creating the trauma with their own sons. The \"who needs [husband's name] anyway, [son's name] is the real man in the house\" speak. As if that's a good thing. \n\n\nI try to gently make them aware about patriarchal brainwashing that causing this and to abandon it entirely and raise their sons to be children. But some are protesting with \"when he grow up to be a great man, another woman will profit from it...what have I got then?\" which is also...valid in a way? \n\n\nCause with no pseudo-husband son and a mommy's son as husband, some of these women really do have nothing (in emotionally being care for side). And I want to know if I am being unfair to them. \n\n\nIs there something I can do to work this out better? To work on my own trauma associated with this and to say the right thing to my male and female peers in this situation when they shared me?\n\n\nEdit: **I need to add that it is not the case of a son making sure his mother's pantry is full, that she is warm and not homeless. Those are just what good adult children should do. Many of these mothers have money and financially successful themselves. Sometimes money is even big factor to make the coercion more successfull. Sis in law's brother for example, was gifted fully furnished house by his mother...two houses away from her own house in order to make the son come and stay more often there. The daughter in law and the grandchildren can stay, but she'd often do sudden inspections and be harsh to the daughter in law about her housekeeping ability.**","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678011310.0},{"title":"Am I overreacting in feeling totally left behind?","author":"gleisner_robot","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11hcmb3\/am_i_overreacting_in_feeling_totally_left_behind\/","text":"I need some external input because I don't want to wrong anybody but also can't really shake my feelings.\n\nSo we are a group of three very close girlfriends and it's been like that for over 15 years now.

He and I had been living together in the house he owned ( my mom died in 2005 and my older brother moved out Feb. 2021). His bills (i.e. the mortgage, the electric bill, water bill, etc.) became my responsibility (on top of the bills I already had previous to his death).  \nTo try and lessen the financial burden I was suddenly presented with, I asked my boyfriend (together 2 years at that time) to move in with me (June 2022). He\u2019s been a huge help, up until recently.  \nIn September 2022, my best friend (16 years) broke up with her boyfriend (they were together 4 years I believe?) not long after she agreed to move to Maine with him (we all live in New Hampshire). She had literally no where else to go so naturally I invited her to move in with me and my boyfriend (they don\u2019t like each other but, they\u2019ve learned to get along for my sake). Here\u2019s where things take a nose dive..  \nMy boyfriend (who had a good job) was recently fired (beginning of February) and so far hasn\u2019t been able to find another job.   \nMy best friend works but she calls out ALOT and doesn\u2019t really pay me rent or anything (she gives me $50 a week when she can which is MAYBE twice a month). So now I\u2019m back to square one.   \nWhen my father passed, he died without a will. I was appointed administrator of his estate. My brother and I have agreed to sell the house I\u2019m currently living in with my two \u201croommates\u201d.  My brother and I filed a \u201cmotion to sell real estate\u201d with the local court but it still hasn\u2019t been approved by a judge yet.   \nWho knows how long this whole process could take (i.e. waiting for the motion to be approved, find a real estate agent, get the house on the market, get the house sold, etc.) so I\u2019m literally stuck trying to cover ALL the household bills, plus my own bills, for the foreseeable future.  \nAnother HUGE problem I have is that when we actually do sell the house.. I have literally no where to go. With the money I currently make, it\u2019s BARELY enough to cover everything and I have MAYBE $100 left to myself at the end of each month so I don\u2019t see how I could save money for a down payment, deposit, etc. for an apartment.  \nWith the money left over (after paying off my fathers debts, what\u2019s left on the mortgage, and giving my brother his half) I\u2019m making an educated guess, that I would be left with $58,000 (on the low end, could be more given todays housing market). But what do I do in the mean time until I have that money in my hand? Like I said, I have no where to go. Also, what about my roommates? Im getting a little sick of being taken advantage of. In a perfect situation, we could all pool our money and find a decent 2 bed. 2 bath. apartment somewhere but that\u2019s not the case. My feeling is \u201cIf they\u2019re taking advantage of me now, it probably won\u2019t be any different when we move somewhere else.\u201d But at the same time, I would feel horrible about leaving them on the street. My boyfriend is a felon (from an arrest over 10 years ago) and he smokes marijuana daily so that\u2019s 2 strikes against him when it comes to jobs and apartments.

During our time together I loaned him money on different difficult occasions (death in family, legal trouble, birthday). He returned a part of it, but then needed some more, and now in the end he owes me a little under a month salary.\n\nI have a feeling that since I was VERY lenient with him before (not really demanding the money from him for years, only occasionally reminding him), he's hoping I'll just forget about it, gift it. When I bring this up, he says he would like to pay me and \"intends to\" at some point, but just can't because he's pretty much always broke. I don't want to gift it to him, as I've given soo much to him and received so little, and frankly there's no reason why I should maintain him. On the other hand, I know this money (about 1000 EUR\/1200 USD) means A LOT more to him than me. I know he struggles every month to survive with his salary and maintain his family (I've seen his back account info). Partly it's not his fault because he's just one man responsible for multiple persons and he can really be unlucky sometimes (his ex employer fucked him over, now he has a good job and boss for the first time ever), but on the other hand he's a bit irresponsible and reckless as well (spending money on vapes, occasionally speeding fines or alike etc.). Regardless, I consider him a good person and I know he means no harm to anyone.\n\nWhat do I do? Do I demand he pays me back, knowing this will make his life difficult, while not adding much to mine?\n\n**TL\/DR: A friend (an ex) owes me money, about a month worth of salary. He needs this money a lot more than I do. Do I insist on him paying it back, just out of principle, or do I let it go (and take this as a learning lesson and good karma)? What would you do?

I\u2019ve been surprised when the topic has come up on Reddit how much people seem to resent receiving an apology from an ex\/former bully\/ family member. So many commenters will agree that they find apologies self-serving and if they got one they would be annoyed and ignore it.  \n\nI fully understand that apologizing doesn\u2019t mean the other person has to forgive you or even respond positively. But I am surprised that more people don\u2019t seem to appreciate it when someone acknowledges they treated them poorly, they were wrong, and they are sorry. I\u2019ve received a few apologies in my life and in each case I felt validated in my feelings and afterwards found it much easier to let go of a difficult memory. The anger towards the other person pretty much evaporates instantly  and I am much happier not feeling bitter, so I don't find apologies self-serving. I think it takes character to acknowledge to someone that you behaved poorly and they deserved better. Some things are unforgiveable but even in those cases I imagine it would make me feel better to hear the other person acknowledge they acted like a POS and they feel bad about it\n\nI\u2019m curious how common my attitude of appreciating an apology vs. finding it self-serving and annoying is.

The job is actually a dream job of sorts, or at least the entry level to it, and is in the field I just finished studying, so I want to do well at it. I am trying my best, but 5 weeks in and I am feeling some imposter syndrome.   \nI drive in in traffic, park in a creepy ass liminal space parking garage, go into a giant office building that is exactly the same as the one next to it (to the point that I have gone to my floor in the wrong building before, because even the elevator voice is identical), go up to the 14th floor, scan myself in, and have a whole day of fighting for my life in spreadsheets, going to meetings that I always leave with ten more things on my to do list, no one seems to be organized or on top of anything, I am still not sure exactly what my job is because so far I am just helping my superior put out fires from when the person I replaced quit. I feel like I am letting people down because I still need help with basically everything, but they are all very busy. Also, I was provided with a very old computer which did not work or allow me access to the cloud drives, which was a huge problem. I just was given a replacement less than a week ago, so I feel really behind from that as well. \n\nI know it will be easier in time, but I guess I'm having some culture shock.

Whenever a difficult incident happens in her life (for example she's trying to upgrade her degree), she spirals and goes on these long ruminating crying jags that range from \"the system is unfair\" to \"I deserve to feel bad\" to \"I'm not depressed, life is just unfair\" and \"nobody can help me, nobody can comfort me\".\n\nShe gets very defensive if you suggest therapy or adjust medication, so I try to just validate, validate, validate.

She tells me it comes off as exclusive (she values inclusivity) and she doesn't know how to navigate conversations with people where \"in the moment she wants to invite them\" (as opposed to noting her desire, checking in with me, then inviting them, which is what I believe she should do. She struggles with this type of \"delayed intent\" possibly from her ADHD? I could be wrong). She communicated she fears this boundary is in place because I don't trust her.\n\nI have offered her reassurances the boundary is not personal to her or anyone else, and I explained it exists because I want control over my front doors. I also explained I consider it polite to ask a host to invite more guests before doing so. But she still doesn't understand and  thought I was attacking her identity and judging her a rude person. I'm trying to speak directly to the behaviour I want to see when it comes to my home \/ boundary. I can see she doesn't understand my line because she is assessing my boundary through the lens of her own value system, rather than accepting it is based on my own values. I also sense her judging the boundary and I feel inclined to justify it (but I really dont want to justify boundaries to anyone, and so I feel in opposition to her). She has a tendency to take things personally and is an anxious person, and her mind got super caught up in this word \"control\" which she said \"doesnt sit right for her\".\n\nTo me this is so easy to understand and when people tell me they have boundaries, I just thank them for telling me and do what I can to respect it. This is what I want from her. I don't understand why this is so complicated, maybe other people tend to be more flexible about this, I dont know.\n\nAnyway. I'd love a reflection from you ladies. Thank you.\n\n\\----------\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you to everyone who offered their perspective. I appreciate the kind yet honest reflections being offered in this thread and I have some great takeaways: an affirmation of my boundary not requiring justification to be respected as well as some great self-reflection topics.\n\n\\-> A boundary is not complete without an upheld consequence \/ responsive action when it is crossed after being disclosed to another party.-> Upholding boundaries can be uncomfortable. Nonetheless, choose to live by values and do not let feelings be the driving force (at risk of ignoring one's own boundaries to avoid awkwardness, etc)\n\nI'm truly impressed by some of the posts here and appreciate this community!\n\n**Resources from thread:**\n\n1.

We're both exactly 30 and it's both our first time having roomies. I feel like we're on the same page on most matters, and both respectful and communicative.\n\nBut we're stuck on the overnight visitors question. She said that she won't be dating, but will often have family (parents, siblings, cousins) visiting. I understand because she's close with her family, they want to see her in the new city, and accommodation is expensive. They are all nice people, but she has 6 siblings and dozens of cousins. Her extended family also has a house nearby the city where they normally stay. On the same note, I likely won't be having overnight visitors. My friends and family are scattered across the world. They plan to visit, but my parents would book hotels\/Airbnbs nearby, whereas most of my friends are partnered up and wouldn't want to impose on the roomie.\n\nWe're looking at a 2-bedroom apartment (under 1000 square feet), with no den. We both WFH all days of the week, and agreed that the kitchen\/living space can be our communal working spaces, since we both don't want to be stuck in our bedrooms working everyday. I wouldn't want to impose on their family time, if they're say, cooking\/enjoying a meal together in the kitchen, and I need to ask them to be quiet. At the same time, I don't want to be stuck in my room all day when they're visiting (I prefer going out to cafes to work, but sometimes it doesn't work out when the cafes are noisy and crowded). I want to be comfortable in my own home, but also want her to feel comfortable in her own home. I also love having visitors and hosting people at home (whether family, friends, Couchsurfers), but I always capped it at a certain number of nights for guests\u2014to have some breathing room (this was also when I lived in a larger apartment\/house, not a cramped 2-bedroom).\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. How many nights would be reasonable for you if your roomie had overnight visitors? She's thinking around 1-week stays maybe 4 times in the year. To me, that adds up to 1 month where I might be uncomfortable, but I'm not sure if I'm being unreasonable.\n2. She initially mentioned only sisters\/mom will be visiting. But now, it seems like dad\/brothers might be, too. Is it fair\/reasonable to request for only female visitors? Nothing personal, but I wouldn't feel comfortable walking around in my jammies with someone's dad around.\n3. Is it fair\/reasonable to ask for only 1 guest at a time? I think having 4 people in a 2-bedroom would be way too cramped (especially if we're both WFH\u2014I would feel the same way even if it's my own family!)\n4. Is it fair to ask that their guest stay in their bedroom\u2014and not crash on the couch?\n5. If I'm away from the city, is it fair\/reasonable to ask that my bedroom be off limits?\n\nAny tips\/experiences you might be able to share would be appreciated! TIA =) (and sorry for the long post!)  \n\n\nEdit: \\*\\*update\\*\\* Hey everyone, thanks so much for your feedback \u2014 I genuinely appreciate it and read each comment! You all were really helpful. It looks like it's not going to work out \u2014 I thought we could compromise (e.g. cap each stay at a few days max and have 1-2 visitors each time, but we were in disagreement over that).

I am 30 years old, my boyfriend is also 30. We've been together for 13 years this April, living together for 11. We have no children by choice, we own a home together (both of us are liable for the mortgage), and we have a 12 year old dog and 8 year old cat. Independent finances. We have our disagreements and have been through our fair share of trials, for sure, especially in our early 20s. But overall we have a happy, stable, healthy, loving relationship. And we still have sex \ud83c\udf89 lol\n\nHere's why I'm posing this question. My boyfriend doesn't believe in marriage. He told me this when we were together for about 6 years, we were about 24 years old. He said it was a choice he made as a child, seeing his own parents' marriage. At the time, I felt like I had to make a choice - if he never changed his mind, if we never got married, do I still want to be with him? And my answer was yes.\n\nFor my side, I did want to get married. Back then, it was more for the party and the dress than for the marriage itself. I admit I wasn't ready or even really worthy of being a wife back then. After letting go of the idea of marriage for awhile, I fell more in love with him. Our connection deepened and we became a very solid couple. Now that I'm 30, the desire to get married is creeping back into my heart. But I can't come up with \"reasons\" as to \"why\". Like I've had 7 years to think about why I want to get married, and aside from \"I love him so much\" and \"I want him to be my husband,\" I got nothin lol. I've talked extensively about this with my therapist and she suggested I make a pros and cons list of getting married vs keeping things the way they are.\n\nI know he would get married if I really pushed the issue. We've talked about it since, I've told him I actually do want to get married and he responded that his feelings had not changed. Also, I want to point out that he also doesn't have any \"reasons\" as to \"why\" either. He simply just made a choice as a child and never revisited the concept, even when he met me and fell in love. So it's also a little hurtful, although I know he loves and adores and needs me, it has been a bit of a mindfuck. But the conversation is open, he's receptive to my thoughts and feelings, and we will need to eventually resolve it.\n\nSo, now that I'm done ranting (this was supposed to be a quick post), what do you think?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** Thank you so much everybody for your input. I spent all afternoon and this morning reading through your responses. \n\nI wanted to add a little bit more context. I don't want to disclose too much personal information about my partner, but to address a common comment: his parents never divorced. His mom stayed at home for 30+ years taking care of his two disabled siblings. She never had a job or even a driver's license during that time. They struggled a lot to make ends meet and they struggled through their marriage. His dad tragically passed away in middle age and his mom was left in a very very bad situation (she's okay now). But they stayed together until the end. \n\nFor the comment that something is \"sus\" or \"wrong\" with his decision not to get married: I am used to being looked at sideways when I say my partner doesn't want to get married. People assume there is either something wrong with *him* or something is wrong with *me*. I don't feel the need to defend him as a person or as a man, but I will say that I never thought that something was inherently \"wrong\" with him because he doesn't want to get married. I love him and know him deeply, and I respect his life experience and how he feels. \n\nThe comment that my therapist's suggestion to make a list is bad advice: The reason she suggested I do that, is because after an hour-long session of talking this to death, I ended up feeling like maybe I agreed with him and *didn't* want to get married. The topic overall has confused me a lot, I've gone back and forth over it for years. She gave me a bunch of materials to go through- a podcast on the history of marriage, an article on why some women choose to stay single, and some other stuff to help me make a decision. \n\nOverall, I love all of your input and advice, so thank you! My main takeaways:\n\n* I can want to be married just because. I feel empowered with that thought. I don't need a list of reasons.\n* There are many legal reasons to make it official, but it doesn't change the dynamic of the relationship overall.\n* People who have been married and divorced are more likely to say it's not necessary.\n* There are ways to legally protect each other without getting married.\n* Our relationship is essentially already a strong marriage without the titles of husband and wife.\n* The wedding and the marriage are two separate things. So if what we have already is essentially a marriage, what I'm really hoping for here is a wedding.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677707770.0},{"title":"Would you consider yourself closer to your parents or your siblings as an adult?

She also gets offended really easy so I just never bring it up. Really the more the merrier, but it does rub me the wrong way. She doesn't do this every time.\n\nSometimes I just want to hang one on one, other times it's because I'm not exactly friends with the person she invites along, but really I am introverted to an extent and would rather have a chance to get to deeper levels of conversation. Our convos are often surface level and she gossips about others a lot and it's harder to steer her toward more intimate conversation with someone else around.Things don't get that deep when we are one on one anyway, so I have definitely lowered my expectations of this particular relationship. \n\nNo, even after decades we might be \"best friends\" but we aren't close friends. Never have been. We are in our 30's and things have changed as she's matured, but not much.\n\nLastly, on the flipside, she has gotten offended in the past if I've gone to an event someone else invited *me* to and I didn't ask her to come with me.

Everything was electric, intoxicating, amazing, wonderful. We connected emotionally, physically, more than I have with anyone I've been in a relationship before. We were different, sure, but those differences were so complementary, it seemed, well, perfect. \n\nNow we didn't live in a fairytale fantasyland, we knew things were going to be hard, he was younger and wanted kids later than me, and I was older and less adventurous and spiritual. We just knew we would figure these things out. We had open communication and that ridiculous, unheard of emotional connection.\n\nWe moved in together and had 6 months of literal bliss. Then a new job came calling, a move to a new city, and his real maturity showed. He did not ask me what I wanted or needed. He did not see the move as an incredibly serious thing. Each day was for living in the moment, not the future, and he did not respond to my needs of more security, of more commitment. He just wanted to be happy. But happiness (in a relationship) is the product of two people's work and when one person wasn't working, it wasn't long-lasting.\n\nThe breakup was swift and he was firm in his decision. I was reeling - how could you be so decisive about ending things when it was so good this entire time? Sure, we were fighting, and sure I've been feeling really insecure lately, and sure I had a panic attack... oh.\n\nWhen I look back on my journal entries from earlier in the year, (yes, our relationship was only one year long), they were panicky scribblings about this person whom I was afraid to love. He dumped all of his romantic expectations on me very early on, telling me how incredibly compatible we were and how a connection like this doesn't come around very often. How we were going to be together for the rest of our lives, but we had only known each other for 2 months! And I fell for it, hook line and sinker. I resisted but to be honest, I wanted to fall in love, and I wanted all the magic, and it was there for a time. We truly were happy. If he were more mature and I had stronger boundaries, we probably could've been together for the long haul. If we had dedicated more time and energy to growth, a new job might not have made our house of cards crumble.\n\nBut it is still what it is. I'm picking up the pieces of my life but I have a sense of satisfaction (it wavers but it's there) that my intuition was right. I let myself fall in love but all along, there were pricklings of doubt, especially when action after action didn't fit the words. \n\nGive the guy a chance, open your heart, be kind to yourself and to others, but trust yourself too. Work on your awareness, stand up for yourself, hold your boundaries firm, and walk when it's time to walk.\n\nI'm still working on it, but it'll get easier every day (or so they tell me).","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677702938.0},{"title":"How do I know if I\u2019m unhappy because of the job or because of the career?","author":"Famous_Tap_7994","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11fqugx\/how_do_i_know_if_im_unhappy_because_of_the_job_or\/","text":"I\u2019m over 30 and I\u2019ve been a software engineer for over 5 years now. The work itself is interesting, definitely frustrating a lot of the time. But I typically feel engaged throughout the day. But there are so many difficult personalities. I just changed companies a month ago and I\u2019m having a really hard time with my manager. I\u2019m isolated and a team of 1 right now, and there really isn\u2019t anyone at the company I can connect with. I literally know no one else at the company because my manager doesn\u2019t have me interacting with any teams. And it\u2019s a WFH role. Manager doesn\u2019t want to hear my feedback. I asked for opportunities to shadow other engineers and to virtually meet the team, but he feels that is a waste of time. Oh, and today he called out a mistake I made and said I should not have made that mistake if I was a real engineer and at my salary level. It was an honest mistake, and because I didn't have the full requirements. Nothing happened because of the mistake, and I did learn from it. All this to say, I know I cannot make it work at this company and I need to leave. I\u2019ve at least made that decision.\n\nBut I don\u2019t know what I want to do AFTER leaving. I don\u2019t know if my unhappiness in my current role is just making me dramatic, and I\u2019m overreacting. Basically, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m feeling unhappy and dumb and unfulfilled because of the current company or if it\u2019s tech in general. \n\nI\u2019m concerned I will never feel happy or settled in a tech role because I am a very emotional person, and the typical personalities I work with aren\u2019t like this. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s not just the job that\u2019s not a good fit, but the entire industry.\n\nHow can I tell the difference? How do I know if an entire career is not right for me? And, if it\u2019s not right for me, how do I figure out what to pursue next? Like, if I decide I don\u2019t want to be a software engineer anymore, how do I decide what to pursue instead? How do I even know what will make me happy and fulfilled? I went into tech for financial security and so I could pursue my hobbies in my free time. But why isn\u2019t that not enough? I tried making my passion a full time job, and that just made me anxious. I feel like \u201cworking to live\u201d, not \u201cliving to work\u201d is the right path for me at least. \n\nI feel like I was supposed to have this figured out 10 years ago. My time in tech is also feeling like a sunk cost situation and I\u2019m feeling extremely trapped. Do fulfilling remote roles at $150k roles even exist outside of software engineering? Maybe I should just be grateful for the salary and stability.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677725841.0},{"title":"Alone on 30th birthday","author":"throwawayooo4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11fosti\/alone_on_30th_birthday\/","text":"Oops, this got a lot longer than I had planned. Apparently I really needed to vent. **Tl;dr: a very bitter soon to be 30y old without any friends doesn\u2019t know how to not spend her birthday crying in bed because her life just sucks so much. Advice or personal anecdotes would be very much appreciated.** \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nFirst of all I want to say that I know this is a first world problem and in the grand scheme of things, who cares. I\u2018m not even a birthday person, I haven\u2019t celebrated since my 18th. But. I always thought 30 would be different, and I pictured this whole Pinterest fantasy with the balloons and the fancy cake and the happy friends and breakfast in bed made by my loving partner.\n\nWell, back to real life. My birthday is on Tuesday. My (ex)girlfriend left me right before I was supposed to move in with her (we were in a long distance relationship for 10 months but lived together for 2 years before). The relationship was getting more abusive over time which left me very isolated but I was already working on making new friends. Because I am a fool and a clown and an idiot and traveled to see my ex whenever I could I developed those precious new friendships in HER city. As you can tell I did not see the breakup coming at all, let\u2019s hope I\u2019ll be wiser in my thirties. For now I don\u2019t have people to spend the day with it. I\u2019ve been trying to be social in my own town again but was very busy with being depressed over my ex leaving me, and didn\u2019t have enough time to get to know anyone well enough to admit to them that I have no one else and no plans for my birthday.  \n\nMy original plan was to go to the spa and pretend it\u2019s self care. \nAnd it didn\u2019t even make me feel like a loser, because life was pretty awful lately with the whole breakup\/not moving\/having to beg for my job back\/having to unpack all my stuff that didn\u2019t even get to leave the house after being packed for a month\/ having to buy new shit after having given so much of it away already because god forbid we have to deal with owning TWO TOASTERS\/trying to be friends with my ex\/ realizing she was abusive\/trying to stop talking to my ex\/writing my dissertation\/ignoring my exes mails after she\u2019s been blocked elsewhere\/downloading and deleting tinder- thing. \n\nUnfortunately due to all of the above I also got sick somehow and lost a lot of weight and a lot of hair and my skin went crazy. My derm doesn\u2019t know what it is or how to treat it but he told me to avoid pools and heat. I also take antibiotics now because it just kept getting worse so I\u2019m also not allowed to drink. *Side note: yes I do feel like the prettiest princess at the ball every time I look in the mirror and see the red flaky skin and dark circles. whenever someone at work asks me something lovely like whether I have Covid again or offers me food and says I look like I haven\u2019t eaten in a month I think \u201cwow this must be the post-breakup glow up everyone is talking about\u201d and just feel sooo happy:)*\n\n\nANYWAY. Because of the dissertation I spend a lot of time alone at home and I do **not** enjoy my own company. I know taking yourself out on a date is the number one recommendation for people who will otherwise be alone  because I\u2019ve been procrastinating my actual research by googling \u201cthings to do by yourself on your birthday that aren\u2019t super sad\u201d very excessively.  I might be able to convince myself to sit down for a cup of tea with myself, but that\u2019s it. am over always having to be around me. I listen to podcasts when showering because I don\u2019t want to listen to my own thoughts, and I can\u2019t remember the last time I fell asleep without background noise. \n\nI\u2019d love to just go to work but already took the day off months ago and can\u2019t change it anymore.\n\nI could meet my mom for breakfast - while I appreciate the gesture I have to add that I asked her to do literally anything else, even lunch, but she works and has plans after work (\u2026..) so it\u2019s either breakfast at 8 or nothing. Also our relationship is not amazing, she will definitely say something about my future boyfriends and how I should bring a guy home now that my \u201croommate\u201c who she refused to ever meet seems to be gone. I came out to her as a lesbian 10 years ago. \n\n\nI am worried I will spiral on my birthday and spend the day hating myself and crying in bed and, worst case, call my ex and let her know I\u2019m actually miserable without her. I need to find ways to prevent that. I will force myself to go on a walk and write into a stupid gratitude journal and I will bake a cake on Monday and decorate it with fancy  and glamorous edible hearts and glitter. Maybe I will cook a nice meal, even thingy I hate cooking and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to have to do the dishes on my already not so amazing birthday. I will see about that.\n\nAfter all this there is still an entire day left though. \n\nDoes anyone know what else I can do? Preferably something that isn\u2019t too depressing or too expensive, and doesn\u2019t involve any sort of self reflection. I\u2019d also very much appreciate stories about your own shitty birthdays and how you survived them and how it made you stronger and better and just turned you into a very happy and great person. Is 40 the new special birthday so that I have ten more years to prepare and hopefully get it right for that one? I also wouldn\u2019t mind some compelling arguments for going with the easiest plan (crying and calling my ex).","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1677720663.0},{"title":"My friend explains everything I do by my zodiac sign","author":"veryspecialnoodle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11f7uir\/my_friend_explains_everything_i_do_by_my_zodiac\/","text":"I have a friend who I've known for a couple of years. She's been going through a tough time lately -- lost her job, got divorced, got into a new situationship and then that fell apart. When she was dating the new guy after being separated from her husband for a few months (her marriage had been a roommate situation for a while, so I didn't feel like she was jumping from her marriage right into this new relationship), she learned that he's a Taurus. I'm also a Taurus. He was the kind of guy who needed a lot of space and wanted to take things slowly. She was clingy and needed a lot of reassurance and communication throughout the entire time they were talking (3 months). She took it upon herself to read up on how it is to date someone who is a Taurus to explain why he wasn't responding to her in the way she wanted. She would be like \"oh well, Tauruses just need more space,\" \"they're slower burners,\" etc, etc. Whenever she would bring this up to me, I would just casually agree because it seemed harmless at the time. I would try to be supportive and help her understand where he was coming from because I could definitely see that she was being needy really early on into knowing him. I wasn't shocked when he ended things, saying he couldn't give her the energy and attention she was asking for.\n\nAnyways, that ended about a month ago, and she's been taking it hard. She's been really leaning on me for support, and I've done my best to be there for her. Sometimes I need my space from her though because I have my own life\/responsibilities\/family that take up a lot of my time. I've been practicing drawing more boundaries, not being immediately available if she needs me, and just being honest with her when I need space.\n\nAny time she asks me to hang out and I don't want to, I'll tell her I just need a night to myself to decompress. She follows that up with \"oh yeah, that makes sense, I really understand Tauruses and their need for space.\" If I tell her that I am overwhelmed with my partner's family being in town, she'll say \"of course you are, you're a Taurus! Your home is a sacred space!\" These are just a couple examples, but it's become enough of a pattern that it's started to bother me. Like, I feel like whatever I tell her, she connects it to me being a Taurus.\n\nI don't know if it's something I necessarily need to bring up with her or if I just needed to vent to the internet.

Reflecting on this has made me realize that I have been confusing \u201cbutterflies\u201d for \u201ctrue love\u201d. I am so grateful for my boyfriend and for the beautiful relationship that we have, and I am not going to let toxic patterns from my past ruin what we have. I love him, admire him, trust him and feel so incredibly lucky to be with him. I am also intoxicatingly attracted to him physically, which is a huge bonus. I tend to be an overthinker, and sometimes, when things are going really well, I panic, wondering when the other shoe is going to drop, and it leads me to self-sabotage. After taking time to step back and reflect on my own thought processes, I realized that the only thing \u201cmissing\u201d here is the cycle of dopamine rush and crash that comes with an uncertain\/risky relationship. For some reason, (probably to justify my past toxic relationships), I had\/have this unconscious idea that if I am not miserable and suffering for it, it\u2019s not \u201creal\u201d love. Woah\u2026that\u2019s fucked up lol. Also, to those who asked, my attachment style is disorganized. I tend to be anxious with avoidant partners and avoidant with anxious partners.

He\u2019s emotionally available and open. he is openly affectionate. Before him, I had a series of \u201cunrequited\u201d loves and situationships with emotionally unavailable, \u201cnonchalant\u201d men. He treats me better than anyone else has ever treated me and consistently makes me a priority through his actions. Part of me wonders if the thrill of the chase and uncertainty of the unknown that was common in my previous (non)relationships is what I\u2019m missing. I\u2019m not sure. \n\nHe is also more of a street-smart, blue-collar kinda guy, while my type is usually the quiet, mysterious, intellectual type. I do sometimes wish we could connect more on an intellectual level, but it\u2019s not something that I really need in my romantic relationship, as I have plenty conversations of this kind with colleagues and friends. \n\nI\u2019m just not sure. It\u2019s been 6 months and he seems to think he\u2019s found \u201cthe one\u201d and I just don\u2019t feel that way. I love him, and I feel loved, but I don\u2019t have that feeling of \u201choly shit you\u2019re my soulmate\u201d kind of feeling. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m not the type to feel that way.

As co-manager of our organization I gave a 6 week notice of my departure. I'm really struggling with being the resident \"lame duck\". In the beginning I was absolutely heartbroken that I had to leave my job, but now, with 3 weeks left to go I feel like everyday is a struggle and I'm just crawling in my skin. My co-managing partner is an older boomer with limited understanding of technical processes, but very good at being a people person, which is an imperative part of our business. We typically compliment one another quite well and have had a great working relationshiop the past few years we've been together. She's trying to understand what I do (finance, operations, and marketing) but I'm finding it extremely difficult to work with her right now. Her world is so small compared to the world of today and the fast pace of information and technology. For example, we were just charged via our company credit card for a subscription service they have just decided they no longer want to use. The subscription automatically charges out for the next 6 months of service. She is upset that the subscription was charged and wants to now have me call the company and tell them to reverse the charges because we are not going to use it any longer and also to reverse the charges for the previous 6 months because we only used it a couple times. Thats... just not how it works... My reply was that it doesn't work that way, like, for example, I have a gym membership I don't use. I cannot go to the gym and say I want a refund for the previous 6 months becuase I know I've been paying for it and agreed to the terms, but I haven't used it so I'd like a refund. I was doubled down on and told to call the credit card company and file a dispute and tell them to turn off the auto charge from this company. Thats not how any of this works!\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar? I feel utterly useless, ganged up on, and that my intelligence is constantly being questioned. The subscription example above is just one of several instances lately. Yesterday was an relatively small issue that could have been easily resolved, but was elevated to the president of our board and opened a huge can of worms that absolutely did not need to be opened. I've had many moments where I just want to toss my personal belongings in my bag and peace out. I know I just need to stick it out and get through the next few weeks, but could use some words of encouragement or anecdotes to get me through this!","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677685369.0},{"title":"Would it be rude\/gross to get my haircut right after the gym?","author":"lucie1312","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11fn7nq\/would_it_be_rudegross_to_get_my_haircut_right\/","text":"I have an appointment to get a wash\/trim\/blow dry tomorrow morning and I was hoping to get a workout in before hand.

I used to be a girl that turned heads everywhere. Slim but curvy, very pretty face, and I\u2019d see mens eyes light up when I\u2019d walk by or smile at them or whatever. People routinely described me as a 10. I\u2019m aware that sounds REALLY arrogant, but that was just the facts of my existence aged 12-29.

Then I suddenly gained another 30+ pounds very quickly in the space of a year. So I\u2019m now 60-70 lb up. Though only about 30 from my \u201cstill hot\u201d weight. A lot of this weight is around my middle and on my face, drowning out my features.

I have no idea what they are or how to stop them coming. My skin had dried up and aged. The nature of my i health issues means it\u2019s not at all easy lose weight.

I started one week before the pandemic. My employer kindly did not fire me. I did get deemed an essential worker (in-office, not public-facing).

We got close fast, I supported her through her aunt's death and she supported me through some surgeries I was having.  The support was chatting and encouragement, sometimes I'd stay up late in the night to talk and she'd do the same for me.\n\nShe had some serious health issues and ended up in the hospital for a week. I did not hear from her during this time, as she did not have access to her phone. She messaged me when she got home and we still were friends but not as intensely. Our messaging dropped down to once or twice a week while she got her strength back, which was understandable.\n\nWe continued being friends like that for another couple of months until one day she disappeared again. I assumed her health had deteriorated and assumed she was in the hospital again.\n\nI sent a message full of good wishes for her and expected she would see it when she got out of hospital. I sent another message telling her I hope she is ok and recovering well about 2 weeks later.\n\nI did not get responses. The weeks went by and turned into months. Once a month I sent a short \"thinking of you\" style message, which still went unread. By this point I was starting to assume that her health complications had gotten so bad that she was either extremely ill, or had in fact died.\n\nI sent her a \"happy birthday\" message in November, believing that if she had been sick, that when she recovers she would see my message and know that I had been here for her and still cared about her.\n\n6 months went by in total that I did not hear from her. At that point I assumed she had died and I began to grieve the loss of her and the friendship. I thought about her a lot and spent a lot of time crying and processing the grief.

Well, she replied.\n\nTurns out she hadn't been sick at all like I thought, she had been travelling around Europe with her relatives. I was simultaneously elated that she was ok, stunned that she was well enough for a trip like that, and deeply hurt that she had essentially ghosted me for 6 months and that I had been through so much emotional pain.\n\nShe said she didn't have service on her phone while travelling all those months and she did apologise vaguely.

I\u2019m 38 years old, I\u2019m a single mother of four. We had been dating a month or so and he brought up the conversation about us being boyfriend and girlfriend, he kept saying it. We both deleted bumble. A few weeks later I saw a badoo notification come up on his phone. I flipped and he started crying and saying he was sorry and it was a mistake. He showed me the app and there was nobody on it. From that moment on I have been assuming he\u2019s been cheating on me. My ex husband of 16 years cheated on me, up until I noticed the message I knew that I couldn\u2019t think everyone was cheating on me and everyone had a clean slate. He\u2019s always followed instagram women but I\u2019m now overthinking that. I\u2019m constantly checking to see when he was online if his followers have gone up or down, I\u2019ve become obsessed. Again till that point I wasn\u2019t bothered. I spoke to him and he deleted about 50 of them. The last few days he\u2019s added a few more and my head has gone again. I\u2019m even spying on his snap score which has gone up a lot the last few days. He\u2019s finally met my kids, they love him and he seems to adore them and he\u2019s wonderful with my kids. He\u2019s sweet and attentive towards me. He works away and every time he\u2019s away my head is all over the place. I also suffer with anxiety and ocd. I didn\u2019t date anyone for over two years so I could try and heal. He stayed with us all over Christmas, my ex sent me some horrible emails that upset me and I was in a mess. I begged him to never do that to me, just tell me outright. He knows that I was in a very abusive relationship and was cheated on, he has also seen his sister been cheated on and has seen the damage that caused her and her children, could a man who has seen so much pain want to cheat? He always talks about the future and when I talk about the kids he says, \u201c how can we help them\u201d or how will we deal with this when they are older\u201d like he wants and knows we will be together for a long time. He\u2019s even spoken about getting a mortgage( a long way off yet) but we have spoken about it. He stayed with us for five days last week and where I was overthinking one morning I blurted out \u201c I can\u2019t do this anymore\u201d he was actually awake and heard this, he started to panic and he kept asking me over and over again what I meant by that. I just said\u201d the kids are being noisy and arguing\u201d my head calmed down and so did my insecurities and we had a good week. \n\nAnyway, do you think I\u2019m overthinking ? I have been cheated on, have ocd and know that I am a massive over thinker. I hate that he looks at instagram women. I know what I\u2019m worth but it still bothers me, am I being insecure ? Was what he did a genuine one off mistake? I don\u2019t want to loose a good thing but my intuition is screaming at me but I will ruin this if I don\u2019t get a grip of myself.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1677617680.0},{"title":"How well do you adjust to change?

For context, I\u2019m single, living at home (totally normal and acceptable in my culture), no major responsibilities (debt, mortgage, etc.), at a job that is cushy professionally and financially. I applied to move abroad (from a developing to a developed country) in early 2020. I was very hopeful and looking forward to the move, but COVID happened and my application seen significant delays, with a final approval coming through only late last year. As with most of us, the pandemic warped my sense of time and motivation to a point where this big move took a complete backseat in my mind and life went on as usual. \n\nBut last year, I decided was lucky to visit the country for a few weeks - I explored a bit, met friends, got a basic feel of the place and returned home. Since then, I haven't been able to get it out of my mind. I almost feel like the impending move is hanging over my head and I have to take a decision soon, which brings me to my question - should I move, is the risk worth it in my early 30s? \n\nHere's my list of pros and cons:\n\nPros\n- A new experience. Although I have traveled a fair bit, I have never really lived away from home. \n- Independence and freedom. I'm super independent, love spending time by myself, learning new things, meeting people, and I think my heart is yearning for a change. \n- Mobility and travel. I get the chance to see a new part of the world. \n- Timing. I have no real commitments holding me back (in terms of a relationship, debt, kids, etc.). Work is okay, but I have been feeling very disengaged and bored\/burned out lately. Not sure what the next few months or years will look like if I prolong the decision, it's now or never.  \n- Stepping out of my comfort zone. I've never done anything this big by myself. My gut is saying go, but my mind keeps pulling me back. And every time I think I\u2019ve arrived at a decision I freak out. \n\nCons: \n- I'd have to leave behind family, and I worry about my ageing parents (in their 60s, no major health issues), although I do have a sibling to care for them in my absence. \n- I won't have a job when I land, but I have been networking a fair bit and I'm hoping that I'll be able to land something in a few months of arrival. \n- Is this too late for me to do something like this? Everyone I know is partnered or married. My fear is wasting time, money, effort just in the name of exploring a new opportunity, when I could stay back build off my current situation (which I am overall happy about), maybe invest in finding a partner too (the pressure to be married is on :\/).  \n- I've never done anything like this before, and I'd be leaving behind any kind of stability I have built so far. \n\nThere is a big part of me that wants to just go for it, but I am also so scared and fearful because it will absolutely be a giant leap of faith. \nHELP!","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1677595261.0},{"title":"How do you \u2018care less\u2019 at work?","author":"radley8367","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskWomenOver30\/comments\/11e1q9v\/how_do_you_care_less_at_work\/","text":"TLDR: As the header says! \n\nI\u2019m 31 with a great career.

Almost a year ago new couple moved in and they make a lot of noise, however, that noise is \"normal\". They don't party or something like that, but they probbaly walk barefoot and very loudly, they also move around furniture a lot and make other \"normal\" noises which we hear very well due to not the greatest sound proofing in the building. While that is fine during day time, I am having issues when they make these noises at night. Sometimes they go to bed at midnight and it's okay, sometimes it's 2 am and I cannot sleep until they stop making those noises so I end up sleeping only 5 hours as I have to get up for work (they dont seem to be working..) We tried to talk to them, but they are from another country and due to language barrier not sure if that helped much. I also left many notes during all this time, as well as slippers by their door, hoping they'd get the hint, but nothing changed. So I am wondering if I can inform police so that the owner would know? (we have this online system where you can inform police on minor misdemeanors) Or is it not okay if they are not partying but just basically living loudly? I don't want to be a bitch but it affects my anxiety and sleep sooooo much. I've been tracking and I have been losing sleep due to them at least once a week for almost a year now. Thanks for you input!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: since I got several comments about people getting killed by police let me make this clear that I am from Europe and things are different here. Have you heard that in Switzerland neighbours can call cops if someone is vacuuming after 10 pm? Well I am not in Switzerland but this is not a joke. In Europe things are a  bit different.  Where I live, there is no property manager or a landlors. People rent their apartments on their own. Nobody gets killed here by police. ever. It is common practise to submit complaint to police (not call the police) online if there is issue of noise or something else minor (for example partying, this is done on regular basis in my country all the time or dog pooping where kids play or car parked in the wrong spot, people submit complaints for all these things). I was only hesitant to do this because they are not partying, just being loud. So when these complaints are submitted they goe to police and someone investigates it by contacting the property owner (which I cannot do because I dont know who he\/she is) and sometimes asking other neighbours if it bothers them too. The outcome is usually a warning to the owner or a very small fine to the owner. Nobody ever contacts or visits these peole directly, unless of course they are the owners which they are not.

The pay was ok, could probably stay there for life although I was very bored and wasn't happy with the projects they gave me. But we all know that wisdom in tech around moving jobs every 2 years to maximise your salary, and sharpening skills, so I moved to a new place with a huge salary increase and glittering tech.\n\nI ended up dealing with a hostile workplace where I felt physically unsafe, and management did nothing and I couldn't just walk out because I was living in a HCOL city where I needed money, so I stayed longer than I wanted to, and I was so anxious and stressed I couldn't put myself through job interviews.\n\nIn the end I decided to leave the city entirely and take time off to recover (it did a number on me). I did so and retrained in some new skills and decided to set up my own business, and the pandemic came along and destroyed that project, so I ended up unemployed much longer than I ever planned. \n\nThen I got a new job and very soon on knew it was a terrible choice and very bad fit but we were put immediately back into confinement so I stayed for stability reasons.\n\nAfter the first year of getting stable I felt like I couldn't leave and go elsewhere because the job was so chaotic that I couldn't really talk about it in job interviews. So I stayed one year further just to try and focus on getting certain projects for my CV I could talk about in job interviews to get out of there. \n\nHere I am interviewing for new jobs and I hope the next is going to be a good one.\n\nIt seems like for the last 4-5 years my career and life has focused around getting out of certain situations rather than going towards any particular destination. I therefore feel like I have very little control over my life because I'm not making strides and moving forward, I'm fighting fires and trying to adapt and cope with the results.\n\nI feel squeezed by the rising living costs, the energy crisis, the fact that the workplace has completely control over us for 40 hours a week and we need to put up with it in order to live and the workplace can lie to you, fuck up your career plans, and force you to work with dangerous people.\n\nI just feel like nothing really matters, none of my accomplishments or my skills or my motivation, because at the end of the day I can't make the choice to progress in my career, I just have to hope that my manager provides a safe workplace and that there's no global pandemic around the corner and no rent crisis to force me into feelings of fear. The luck of the draw.\n\nI know I have control over my life objectively speaking, but the mental toll of certain life events can really knock the wind out of your sails and make you function at lower capacity. So yes I have control but no I could not implement any actions to get me out of where I am over the last few years due to events stacking up one after the other and having to play things safe.\n\nAnd, for privacy reasons, I didn't even mention how many things went wrong in my personal life at the same time. I would say 3-4 giant explosions happened over this time that gutted me. So I had that to recover from too.\n\nI wish I could go back to that time where I was in that boring job where I wasn't happy, because at least there was stability back then, and it wasn't the worst job in the world. It was the last time where I genuinely felt like I was aiming and shooting for things, instead of running for cover while being shot at by one disaster after another.\n\ntl;dr Made a decision years ago that has resulted in me having no life goals since, as my energy has been invested in working to get out of every negative situation that followed, and focused on attempting to avoid repeats of past situations, rather than invested in and focused on bright future possibilities.
