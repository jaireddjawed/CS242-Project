        "text": "So there's this video released by a YouTube channel called \"Geography Now!\" about Lithuania, and you can see it here - https://youtu.be/9Yxwjy4pvsM\n\nIt's... cute. Fairly basic. Most of the facts are fairly common knowledge, it's good at beginner's initiation, though definitely not something you should use as a source for a geography essay. The spelling of Lithuanian words is laughable.\n\nThere's also some history tidbits sprinkled in like confetti, and most of it is... quite bad.\n\n&gt;Lithuania, or \"Lietuva\", gets its name from \"Lietus va\", which means \"Rain here\"\n\nI would normally assume that this is some sort of joke, but since they don't follow it up with a laugh, smile or correction, I'll have to take it at face value and say that this is complete bollocks.\n\nThough writer Justinas Marcinkevičius has joked that \"Lietuva\" might come from \"lietus\" (\"rain\") as a reference to the large amount of rainfall, emphasis needs to be put on the word *joked*. In reality, this is nothing more than a coincidence. \n\nThe history website Voruta has a very good summary of the Lithuanian name dilemma (article in Lithuanian) - http://www.voruta.lt/lietuvos-vardo-kilme . To put it simply, nobody has a clue on what the origin of the name is, and your guess is as good as mine, but the most likely hypotheses are from the river Lietava/Lietauka (small stream in Kernavė area, nucleus of the early Lithuanian state), from the word \"lieti\" (\"to melt, unite\" - i.e. theory of \"Lietuva\" being the name of a tribal confederation), or from the class name \"leičiai\" (early Lithuanian warriors and duke tenders, i.e. theory of \"Lietuva\" emerging from the period of Lithuanian raiding, maybe as an exonym). \n\nNo, we're not dumb enough to calm ourselves \"rainy land\", especially when there are much rainier countries which don't call themselves that.\n\n&gt;early Lithuanian tribes were unified by King Gediminas, the only king of Lithuania in history\n\nHa. Haha. Hahahaha.\n\nNo, the person you are looking for is King *Mindaugas* - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindaugas \n\nGediminas was a real ruler of Lithuania, yes, but he was not a King, at least not in the eyes of Western Europe, as he was pagan and thus could not be crowned by the Papacy. Sure, he claimed to be a king himself, but if we were to count claims, then we wouldn't have one king of Lithuania, but five or six.\n\n&gt; Famous people from Lithuania include:\n\n&gt;[...]\n\n&gt;Vytautynas, who was kind of supposed to be the king, but then died before it could happen\n\nI struggle to think that someone could misspell the name *Vytautas* like that. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vytautas \n\nI mean... it's hard to take this channel seriously when they couldn't even copy the name from the title of the Wikipedia page properly.\n\nAnd while the anecdote about Vytautas's failed coronation is certainly correct, it would have been nice for there to be at least a mention of the actual main reason why he is famous - this being the Battle of Grunwald. You know, one of the biggest medieval battles in Eastern Europe?..\n\n&gt; [...] , writer Salomėja Nėris\n\nSalomėja Nėris was certainly a notable writer, but it's weird to mention her as the most famous person of Lithuanian literature when she, more notably, betrayed Lithuania for the Soviet Union. It'd be like using Knut Hamsun as the representative of Norwegian literature (though his impact on literature was much higher than that of Nėris's). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salomėja_Nėris\n\nPersonally, I would pick someone like Maironis or Jonas Biliūnas instead. Maybe even Marius Ivaškevićius, for famous contemporary writers.\n\nOutside of that, there isn't much else to cover, because there is simply little else of note that is related to history.\n\nAlthough it's weird that while going through foreign relations of Lithuania, they don't even mention Lithuanian-Russian relations.",

what do i have in hand as a fan to trust what they say? \n\n\n# #4 details are not so 'clickbaity' \n\nusually, you can know a pro from an amateur when it comes to details. many events in history requires a lot of details and backgrounds and even backgrounds to the backgrounds. it's not that people decided that \"hey guys, let's go kill each other!\" or \"let's do that!\" \n\n \nlike nowadays, there are so many factors and so many details usually get ignored in the middle. because at the end of the day, you want to explain some history in 10 minutes, you have to cut from here and from there and focus on the event itself. and sometimes it delivers the wrong impression about it\n\nto best demonstrate this, i have to use an example, imagine explaining that the Syrian civil war happened because of the US and Russia\n\nthis statement needs so much clarification in addition to the fact that this is not entirely true, but this is how some channels deal with discussing events from the past \n\n# #5 historical details are susceptible to change, sometimes entirely\n\nmost people imagine that history is a definite, closed source material, and there is no room in it for new data and renewing (or even rewriting) what we previously knew about the past. it's a story that we only need to verify according to newbies\n\nspecially in the very ancient histories, there are huge uncertainty about data either due to lack of artifacts, or sources, or even mentioning. and some events do have theories that are equally possible, almost everyone fill the gaps with his own words that fits the story, even though this might have never happened\n\nthe youtube history channels often deals with the material we have in hand on the even as definite, thus making their narration sounds like an amusing movie in which we know the details for sure. even for things we are certain of. there is no room for possibilities with them \n\nit's much like science, new archaeological data can make you change everything you know about something\n\n# #6 bias\n\nHumans form opinions, and part of these opinions include philosophies, thoughts, ideologies and religious beliefs, no one is safe from the vice of taking sides in history, so it's important for the one who receives data to be aware that bias is almost unavoidable. so eventually, everyone has to form their knowledge in history through various sources. \n\nthis can be vital in other reasons too because, with anonymity, political and national biases play a role in the message some channels deliver. specially when talking about modern history (like WWII), so it's important not to let your knowledge exclusive from one place. you will eventually mislead yourself\n\n\n#Edit: you can consider it #7 too. \n\nwars are dealt with in history channels as a game, something exotic that everyone should pay attention to. actually, it was the exceptions even in the past, and people back then tried to avoid wars too. no one is happy about a mass killing event. the way wars introduced in these channels feels like an exotic experience for fans whom never been into one, other than how it should be introduced, a horrible development of events. maybe this jingoist attitude towards war either feeds fans a jingoist agenda about history in general or just a way to attract followers through clickbait policy",

        "text": "A [Lost Causer shared a link](https://i.imgur.com/sAiZ56h.png) to a website which asks \"[Was the Civil War About Slavery?](http://archive.is/PjspP)\"\n\nWhat follows is some of the best (worst) Lost Cause writing I've seen. Before diving into R5, this particular case ends on a somewhat happy note; the [OP admits to being misled](https://i.imgur.com/o4Zl0OB.png) and seems to actually have taken the advice of a few replies of why the Civil War was, in fact, fought over slavery. It can often seem that replying to people who hold these sorts of objectively false beliefs seems futile, but sometimes it gets through. \n\n\n\nHere we go: \n\n&gt;Many people think the Civil War of 1860-1865 was fought over one issue alone, slavery.\n\nNearly nailed it, it started in 1861. Unfortunately the truth is even more scant after the opener. \n\n&gt;Nothing could actually be further from the truth. The War Between the States began because the South demanded States’ rights and were not getting them.\n\nRights which included the institution of slavery or were entirely built upon it. \n\n&gt;The Congress at that time heavily favored the industrialized northern states to the point of demanding that the South sell its cotton and other raw materials only to the factories in the north, rather than to other countries. \n\nThis is an outrageous lie and completely ignores the popular Southern strategy of \"King Cotton\", basically the belief that Europe's dependence on the South's cotton would bring those powers to the Confederates' aid. However, it didn't pan out because of the record exports the South had made to Europe in the decade prior to 1861, the same large exports which allowed England to stockpile enough cotton to last for years and even allowed her to sell it on the European market at a huge profit once the Union blockade went into effect.  \n\n&gt;The Congress also taxed the finished materials that the northern industries produced heavily, making finished products that the South wanted unaffordable. The Civil War should not have occurred. If the Northern States and their representatives in Congress had only listened to the problems of the South, and stopped these practices that were almost like the taxation without representation of Great Britain, then the Southern states would not have seceded and the war would not have occurred.\n\nThis lie is at least as big, probably bigger, my take on this is that the author is referencing the [Morrill Tariff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrill_Tariff) which went into law in 1861. In the decades prior to 1861 the Democrats (Southerners) had managed to eliminate and block nearly every tariff the US had or was thinking about implementing. The Whig party (Northerners) had wanted to implement tariffs which would protect the North's still young industry, but had been blocked by the South quite successfully. The sole reason that the Morrill Tariff passed is because most every Southerner had left Congress in preparation to secede. Before that the South was able to control US economic policy nearly as it wished. \n\n\n&gt;I know for many years, we have been taught that the Civil War was all about the abolition of slavery, but this truly did not become a major issue, with the exception of John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry, until after the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, when Abraham Lincoln decided to free the slaves in the Confederate States in order to punish those states for continuing the war effort. \n\nSlavery; not a major issue...except large for enough for nearly every state of the Confederacy to specifically cite is as the reason for secession or to prominently enshrine it in the new state constitutions. Here are a selection of [The Declaration of Causes of Seceding States](https://www.civilwar.org/learn/primary-sources/declaration-causes-seceding-states)\n\n**Georgia**: For the last ten years we have had numerous and serious causes of complaint against our non-slave-holding confederate States with reference to the subject of African slavery.\n\n**Mississippi**: Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.\n\nSouth Carolina and Texas both manage to not come right out and say it in the first paragraph, but wrapped up in the flag of liberty and revolution, both states make the point that slavery was promised to them and were leaving because it was being threatened. \n\n\n\n&gt;The war had been in progress for two years by that time.\nMost southerners did not even own slaves nor did they own plantations. Most of them were small farmers who worked their farms with their families. They were fighting for their rights. They were fighting to maintain their lifestyle and their independence the way they wanted to without the United States Government dictating to them how they should behave.\n\nThis seizes on a grain of truth; that many poor whites didn't own slaves and were fighting for their homes, not for slavery, it fails to mention that owning slaves was an esteemed status symbol and owning a slave was an ubiquitous Southerner \"lottery dream\". \n\n\n&gt;Why are we frequently taught then, that the Civil War, War of Northern Aggression, War Between the States, or whatever you want to call it, was solely about slavery?\n\nBecause  most survey classes don't dive into every minutiae over why something happened, they cover the cornerstones, the foundation, the raison d'etre - and for the ACW, that is slavery. \n\n  &gt;That is because the **history books are usually written by the winners** of a war and this war was won by the Union. \n\nThat phrase. \n\n&gt;However, after following my family around since I was just a year old to Civil War Living History scenarios in Gettysburg and elsewhere, I have listened to both sides of the story, from those portraying historical figures, both Union and Confederate. \n\nDid you catch that? He admitted to learning about history from the side of the losers. \n\n&gt;Through listening to these people and also reading many different books, including some of the volumes of The Official Records of the Civil War, Death in September, The Insanity of It All, Every Day Life During the Civil War, and many others, I have come to the conclusion that the Civil War was about much more than abolishing the institution of slavery.\n**It was more about preserving the United States** and protecting the rights of the individual, the very tenets upon which this country was founded.\n\nThe mental gymnastics necessary to draw that conclusion always remind me of the parable of building a house upon the sand, without a solid foundation it all will fall apart. Every single example of a reason why the Civil War happened can easily be traced back to slavery, and typically it only takes one move to link it, it's not some 7 Degrees of Jefferson Davis. I don't understand how someone can claim to critically approach slavery's impact on the Civil War and conclude that is isn't the foundation. \n\nAnd yes the author did just casually conclude that the reason the South seceded was to *preserve the US*. Up is down, nothing matters. \n\n&gt;I personally think that the people who profess that the Civil War was only fought about slavery have not read their history books. I really am glad that slavery was abolished, but I don’t think it should be glorified as being the sole reason the Civil War was fought. There are so many more issues that people were intensely passionate about at the time. Slavery was one of them, but it was not the primary cause of the war. The primary causes of the war were economics and states’ rights.Slavery was a part of those greater issues, but it was not the reason the Southern States seceded from the Union, nor fought the Civil War. It certainly was a Southern institution that was part of the economic system of the plantations, and because of that, it was part and parcel of the economic reasons that the South formed the Confederacy. The economic issue was one of taxation and being able to sell cotton and other raw materials where the producers wanted to, rather than where they were forced to, and at under inflated prices. Funny, it sounds very much like the reason we broke from Great Britain to begin with. \n\nThe author's desire to show he's not a racist and to quite possible prove that the true US patriot was Johnny Reb all along. \n\n\n&gt;The South was within their rights, but there should have been another way to solve the problem. If they had been willing to listen to Abraham Lincoln, perhaps the war could have been avoided. Lincoln had a plan to gradually free the slaves without it further hurting the plantation owners. He also had a plan to allow them to sell their products anywhere they wanted to and at a fair price. They did not choose to listen to the President, however, so they formed the Confederacy and the Civil War began.\n\nIt's the first I'm hearing of Lincoln's plan to gradually end slavery, but I'm not sure the author realizes that it wouldn't have mattered because the entire reason the Southern states left the Union was because of the threat of slavery ending. At least he doesn't blame the Union for warmongering.",

        "text": "A few months ago, I made [a post](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/7hvim9/japanese_cultural_values_are_an_inherent/) about [a person](http://archive.is/0a6XO) who thinks that the reason Japan stopped being a tech industry leader after the 1980s, and didn't adapt to the shift to software-based business models, was that they had \"Eastern Confucian values\" as opposed to \"Western Enlightenment values.\"\n\nBut recently, I found an academic article titled [\"The Japanese Software Industry: What Went Wrong and What Can We Learn from It?\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279219536_The_Japanese_Software_Industry_What_Went_Wrong_and_What_Can_We_Learn_from_It) by Robert E. Cole and Yoshifumi Nakata, talking about the reasons why the industry didn't adapt. The \"post-war economic miracle\" really ended up hindering Japan in the end.\n\nHere are some important passages:\n\n(pg 17)\n&gt;Japanese leaders, with their strong success in manufacturing hardware, found it much more difficult to envision software as a full partner, much less alternative model. It is also a plausible hypothesis that the weakness of American manufacturing globally, relative to Japanese firms, gave American firms stronger incentives to search, sense, monitor, and respond to the new opportunities created by software.\n\nBy \"weakness\" they probably mean things like the overtaking of the US auto industry by Japan and the whole notion in the 1980s that Japan will economically and technologically surpass the US.\n\n(pg 31)\n&gt;[Arthur] Stinchcombe stressed the importance of understanding what enables those founding characteristics [of an organization] to persist over long periods of time. The answer lies in what researchers have come to label the path dependency of organizational and technological learning. A firm’s prior organizational routines, norms, and corporate culture (its history), often reproduced over long periods, can constrain its future behavior. This is partly because opportunities and incentives for learning often will be close to previous capabilities. The more a firm uses a technology, the better it get at that technology with cumulative sunk costs in human and physical capital. If a firm succeeds over time using a given technology, dynamic increasing returns may cement its commitment to that technology.\n\n&gt;One can apply this understanding to the hardware-centric origins and sustained commitment to their technology on the part of established Japanese electronics and other high-tech firms. Their very success reinforced these capabilities over long period of times. In the case of electronics firms, electronic engineers were dominant in the founding of these firms. This occupational specialty dominated management as they evolved into IT firms. It is plausible that this history continues to constrain their transition to software.\n\n(pg 39-40)\n&gt;Japan typically ranks among the lowest-scoring Asian nations in English language proficiency scores. The Korean case reminds us that policy makers in other nations can choose to build strong English language proficiency not only among those aiming for IT professional occupations, but indeed among the broad population. The potential benefits for growing an IT industry by having the youth of the society grow up with English languages skill (accessing the English language internet from an early age on a regular basis) should not be underestimated.",

        "text": "I haven't made a post in a while so I thought I'd do a quick one.\n\nCrash Course consistently gets recommended to people wanting an introduction to world history, so I thought it was about time I took a look to see what it's like, starting with their video on \"[Venice and the Ottoman Empire #19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN-II_jBzzo).\" Generally speaking, I was pleased with his presentation, despite the annoying style. I thought the simplifications he made were mostly reasonable for an audience at the introductory level. He compared the Ottomans with Venice in an effort to demonstrate how they both benefited from trade with one another. But as this is the badhistory subreddit, I do need to point out his mistakes:\n\n&gt;…but Ottoman expansion reached its greatest extent under Suleiman the Magnificent [5:34]\n\nOttoman expansion reached its greatest extent in different directions at different points in time. In the east against Safavid Iran, this was three decades after the death of Süleyman and in the north against Europe this was more than a century after Süleyman.\n\n&gt;…he took valuable territory in Mesopotamia and Egypt\n\nEgypt was of course conquered not by Süleyman, but by his father Selim I.\n\n&gt;…and he turned the Ottomans into a huge naval power\n\nThe Ottomans became a naval power under Süleyman's grandfather Bayezid II, who demonstrated this by defeating Venice at sea in the Battle of Zonchio in 1499. Speaking of which... a video about Ottoman-Venetian relations that does not ever mention that the two states were also imperial rivals and fought wars with one another?\n\n&gt;“…the Ottomans just bypassed the problem of hereditary nobles altogether by creating both an army and a bureaucracy from scratch… how? The devşirme, a program in which they kidnapped Christian boys… and raised them either to be part of an elite military fighting force called the Janissaries, or government bureaucrats… either way you weren’t allowed to have kids which prevented the whole hereditary nobles problem and also ensured that the Ottoman government would contain quite a lot of eunuchs. [6:44]”\n\nWhen will I at last find a popular author/educator who actually understands the devşirme? Devşirme recruits (who were conscripted, not \"kidnapped\") did not become bureaucrats. The bureaucracy was manned by a scribal class of educated, free Muslims. Devşirme recruits who didn't join the standing army (which consisted of more than just the Janissaries) were educated to become the sultan's personal palace servants, and when they graduated from that position they became the empire's military-administrative elite (governing provinces, commanding armies) and were allowed to have children. The Ottoman elite was hereditary. They didn't inherit specific titles, ranks, or offices as in Europe, but they did inherit membership in the Ottoman elite class.\n\nAnd what do eunuchs have to do with it? Is this that weird \"devşirme recruits were castrated\" myth I see popping up on Reddit from time to time? The rest of the video gives me the impression that he does understand what eunuchs were, so this part was just confusing.\n\n&gt;Also this relationship [between Venice and the Ottomans] established firm connections between Europe and the Islamic world which allowed ideas to flow again... I mean I guess those connections had existed for a long time but Crusades aren't a great way to exchange ideas.\n\nHere's where he should have zoomed out to put his topic in a wider context. It wasn't the relationship between Venice and the Ottoman specifically which allowed the exchange of ideas, but rather the level of trade and exchange between Europe and the Islamic world which had *in general* been increasing since c. 1000 CE. There was nothing particularly new or special about the relationship between the Ottomans and Venice in this respect - as he even notes in the video, the Venetians had a similar relationship with the Mamluks in Egypt long before the Ottomans came onto the scene. And the Crusades were *definitely* part of that - they *did* allow for the exchange of ideas. The Crusades brought thousands of Latin Christians to Muslim lands and saw vast numbers of Arabic manuscripts fall into their hands to be translated and disseminated. His mistake was to focus too narrowly on his specific topic without situating it in a wider world-historical context.",

        "text": "Basically, calling Franco or Nationalist Spain fascists doesn't capture the full story of Franco's political ideology and consolidation of power during and after the Spanish Civil War or the history of Spain at the time. It's a cheap buzzword that doesn't accurately describe Spain's situation, Franco's political coalition, his national policies, or Spain's relationship with other countries (among other things). People of various stripes like to call them fascist, but it's more in service of some agenda than based in reality. Fascists played a part in the 1936 uprising, but were not the prime movers and would be sidelined (along with the Carlist monarchists) during the war by Franco. The support given to them by the fascist states of Nazi Germany and Mussolini's Italy don't automatically make them fascists either.\n\nThis is a topic that hasn't been touched on here yet. AskHistorians (/u/tobbinator in particular) [has answered](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3khjtp/why_did_europe_tolerate_francos_fascist_regime/cuxn5mo/) [questions on](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/44rf86/was_francisco_franco_a_fascist_or_was_his/) [this before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/263n6t/how_was_spain_able_to_remain_independently/chng0ja/) but nobody's ever debunked this brand of badhistory on here yet, so I figured I might give it a shot.\n\nThis quest began with [somebody cautioning the OP of a SCW-related post that fascism might be a poor term for encompassing the Nationalists and getting brutally downvoted:](https://web.archive.org/web/20180414232106/https://www.reddit.com/r/PropagandaPosters/comments/8c6twf/february_11_1873_a_yearning_april_14_1931_hope/)\n\n&gt;Might want to be a bit careful throwing the word 'fascist' around to describe the Nationalist rebels in the Civil War.\n\nThe ensuing thread is a brief, but densely concentrated dose of badhistory, some of it obviously flagrant and other parts less so. The first great whiff:\n\n&gt;I mean, they had the support of Hitler and Mussolini, and the main party of the regime was Falange, a fascist party that used to receive funding from Mussolini.\n\nLet's split this into parts.\n\n&gt;I mean, they had the support of Hitler and Mussolini\n \nWhile the two fascist states helped the Nationalist rebels, it was not out of the belief that they were fascist. Nazi Germany's foreign ministry strongly opposed supporting Franco, believing that such a policy would commit Germany to support of an insurrection that was far from guaranteed to succeed and potentially spark a war which Germany had no chance of winning. Hitler, under the influence of key Nazi officials like Hermann Goering and Wilhelm Canaris as well as the flattery employed by Franco's agents (remember that Germany by this time had acquired something of a pariah status by other European countries, and even Italy had only started to become friendly with Germany after the sanctions from their war against Ethiopia) was swayed by Franco's obsessive anti-communism and the depiction of the war as one of anti-bolshevism. Hitler said: \n\n&gt;&gt; \"If there had not been the danger of the Red Peril's overwhelming Europe, I'd have not intervened in the revolution in Spain. The Church would have been destroyed.\n\nand that Spain offered \"a convenient side-show which occupied the great powers and left Germany to pursue her aims in the east\". Germany also imported significant amounts of ores from Spain that they felt the nationalists would have protected as opposed to the newly elected left-wing coalition: the Popular Front. Even then, German assistance to the nationalists was small at first- 26 airplanes with 86 men along with some equipment. It specifically only went to Franco, was secret, and was intended to be defensive in nature. It was only later as Hitler became further sucked into the conflict- as the professional diplomatic corps had warned of- that the Condor Legion would enter the fray and Germany would overtly support Franco.\n\nThe first Nationalist envoys to fascist Italy were prominent monarchists from General Emilio Mola (\"El Director\", the mastermind of the coup). They approached Italian foreign minister Count Ciano, who eagerly lobbied on their behalf to Mussolini. He would later remark to the first Italian ambassador to nationalist Spain:\n\n&gt;&gt; \"[T]he Duce had only 'very reluctantly agreed to lend Franco military support'\".\n\nStill, Mussolini was angered by French support to the Spanish Republican government, was again flattered by Nationalist agents, and was in search of something to keep Italy on a war-footing. He would say that Italians had to \"be kicked up on the marks by their shins\" and when he later became as entrapped as Hitler was, said \n\n&gt;&gt;\"When the war in Spain is over, I shall have to find something else: the Italian character has to be formed through fighting.\"\n\nAnd as for Italy funding the Falangists, I think it's important to note that the Carlists acquired military training from Italy and weapons from Germany even before the uprising!\n\nI haven't been able to find any evidence of either fascist government citing the fascism of Nationalist Spain or Franco as a reason to support them, only their anti-communist beliefs &amp; support of national interests. This is a key distinction. There were certainly individuals within these fascist states like Nazi General Wilhelm von Faupel (representative of Germany to Nationalist Spain) who attempted to strengthen the Falange and thought of the war as a fascist one rather than simply an anti-communist one, but these figures were not as influential as they would have liked to be and certainly did not make the Falange strongg enough to withstand Franco's eventual co-option of them.\n\n&gt;and the main party of the regime was Falange, a fascist party that used to receive funding from Mussolini.\n\nTreating the Falange in Spain as static is a a critical error. Indeed, treating any of the factions/national governments involved in the Spanish Civil War (or any war, for that matter) as totally static is a mistake commonly made by many, and is in many ways actively perpetrated by the belligerents themselves &amp; ideologues during and after to war for propaganda purposes. By the outbreak of civil war, the Falange was shattered by the arrest of its most of its leadership by republicans (Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera, Ledesma Ramos, Ruiz de Alda, etc.). Hugh Thomas, in his book *The Spanish Civil War*, cites Stanley G Payne's *Falange* to illustrate further how the Falange was weakened as a result of the events of mid-July in 1936:\n\n&gt;&gt; \"The mass of the non-military class began to see the Falange as their way of identifying themselves with the 'Crusade'. These recruits soon greatly outnumbered the old survivors. Almost none of them knew anything about ideology. They knew that the Falange was against the 'reds'; what else mattered? Thus, 2,000 people signed up for the Falange in Seville in twenty-four hours in July\"\n\nFranco's exile of the prominent Carlist Fal Conde in 1937 crippled the Carlist movement's influence within the nationalist cause, and signaled Franco's intention to entrench himself as Generalissimo of Spain. Conde attempted to form a merger between the Carlists and Falangist friends of Primo de Rivera (the \"Madrid group\") but it failed, as did an attempted coup within the Falangist organization by the Madrid group to remove Manuel Hedilla (Falange provisional leader as Primo de Rivera was dead in a Republican jail). While this was occuring, Franco was guided by his brother-in-law Ramón Serrano Suñer, who urged a consolidation between the parties. Franco used the disorganization of the Falange &amp; Carlists to force them to unite into a single party along with all other supporters of the Nationalist cause, jailing potential opponents or sending them to the frontlines to fight away from areas where they could conduct intrigues against him.\n\nThus, Franco's co-option of the Falangists (and Carlists) was simply a political move to grant himself legitimacy and consolidate power rather than a genuine pursuit and employment of its ideology. [Franco's \"ideology\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/44rf86/was_francisco_franco_a_fascist_or_was_his/) [was not fascist](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/263n6t/how_was_spain_able_to_remain_independently/chng0ja/).\n\nIn response to this comment, OP makes a mistake in his response, claiming:\n\n&gt;The Falange supported economic collectivism and syndicalism, two core parts of their ideology absent from Francoist Spain. In addition, Franco abandoned the support of the Falange and the Cortes was governed by the National Movement.\n\nThe Falange did not support syndicalism as an inherent part of its ideology. They negotiated a merger in early 1934 with JONS (Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista, or Unions of the National-Syndicalist Offensive), who were a syndicalist party, but shed JONS's national syndicalist ideology later that year as they broke over responses to the Spanish October Revolution of 1934 and sought to please their monarchist and traditional conservative funders. In any case, when Franco took over, the falange answered to him and his political needs.\n\nThe response is met with:\n\n&gt;They didn’t even introduce national syndicalism in the areas they controlled during the war. Yes, FET y de las JONS dropped national syndicalism in favor of clerical fascism after the war, but the Falange wasn’t a syndicalist group in practice or even in theory, since, as I said earlier, they only supported syndicalism to try and get the anarcho-syndicalists on their side.\n\nThey didn't drop it after the war, they dropped it before. And I don't know much about the Falange after the 1950s, but \"clerical fascism\" seems a bit extreme. Perhaps /u/tobbinator can elaborate on that point?\n\nAnother comment whiffs big:\n\n&gt;The Falangists were literal, by the book, fascists. Whilst the nationalists were a broad coalition consisting of Absolute Monarchists, Militant Nationalists, Theocrats and the like but the leadership fell into the lap of Franco and the Fallange who were, no doubt, fascist.\n\nAgain, the Falange started off as fascist but did not stay so. Especially when Franco forcibly merged them with a host of other right-wing movements supporting the Nationalists.\n\nThey go on to state:\n\n&gt;But Franco didn't start the civil war and, despite Franco changing some tenants of the party, Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista remained the ruling party and were objectively falangist and fascist. Franco tried to change certain aspects of falangism but he did not change it away from fascism, nor was he opposed to fascist ideology.\n\nFranco was a major player in the uprising- being in command of the Army of Africa that was essential to the military successes of the Nationalists and one of the triumvirate between himself, Jose Sanjurjo, and El Director Emilio Mola. While he was not intended to be the leader from the beginning (Sanjurjo was before he died in a plane crash trying to go to Spain from his Portugese exile), he was undoubtedly an important figure. If \"starting the civil war\" is the metric we choose to define its ideology, then Carlism is a better fit than Falangism or fascism, as Sanjurjo and Mola were both Carlist or Carlist-inspired. Of the core Nationalist rebels, only Juan Yagüe comes to mind as a Falangist and I don't think he was in the planning process. Again, this particular interpretation of \"Franco's Falangism\" ignores the political changes that occurred in 1936-1937.\n\nNone of this is to say that Franco's a chill guy. He actively encouraged the massacres of tens of thousands in order to secure control through fear and oppressed Spaniards for quite some time. He helped make the Spanish Civil War as brutal as it was, and he was an absolute disaster for Spain. He just wasn't fascist, and neither was Nationalist Spain.\n\nHonestly, I feel like there's more to discuss and elaborate on but I've taken long enough on this post as it is and it's probably getting pretty unreadable by now. Thanks for sticking with me if you made it this far!\n\n\nSources:\n\nBeevor, Anthony: The Battle for Spain\n\nThomas, Hugh: The Spanish Civil War",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8bydk5/real_crusades_history_gets_some_stuff_wrong_about/",
        "text": "Hello fellow historians! Today I’m looking at [this video](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY) by everyone’s favorite crusades apologist, Real Crusades History. Real Crusades History’s youtube channel is a wealth of badhistory but today I’ll be focusing on one of his older videos today, simply because it showed up in my recommendations. This post will probably be a little bit shorter than my usual posts but the longer posts should return next week as i have two fairly large posts that I’m currently working on. There’s probably more inaccuracies than what I found, but these were the ones that I could find with a little digging into some books down at the library.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[0:32](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=32s)- Isabella was not really the queen of Spain, she was the queen of Castile and Leon. The first true ruler of a Unified Spain would be Isabella’s grandson Carlos, known more commonly as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire. This isn’t too bad though considering the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella united most of what is today the kingdom of Spain. As far as I’m aware however she’s usually referred to as Isabella of Castile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[0:39](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=32s)- Enrique IV of Castile and Leon was not Isabela’s stepbrother as the video claims. He was her half-brother born of Juan II’s first wife Maria. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[1:18](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=1m18s)- I wouldn’t say that Enrique IV had an “early death” either. He reigned for 20 years and was almost 50 when he died. That’s not particularly old but I wouldn’t say that that makes him young either. I guess this is subjective though so it’s not that big of a deal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[1:22](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=1m23s)- Isabella’s ascension to the throne is a lot more complicated than the video implies. Isabella was named heir to Castile but so was her niece Juana. Enrique IV’s death complicated matters further as he had left no will and had named both women as his heir. Juana, daughter of Enrique IV, was still the princess of Asturias, the traditional title of the heir to Castile, and wife of King Alfonso V of Portugal. Enrique IV would also voice support for Juana as his heir after he had been forced to name Isabella as heir in 1468 by rebellious nobles. However, Isabella seized the throne upon Enrique’s death and the Castilian Civil War began over which of the two women would be queen. Also just in case anyone tries to say that Joanna was secretly illegitimate, there’s no proof of this accusation and the attempts to spread this rumor were propagated by Isabella’s supporters to make her claim more legitimate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[1:23](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=1m23s)- On a related note, Isabella did not become the heir to Castille after the deaths of her brothers, she became queen because her brother Enrique IV was the king. If RealCrusadesHistory had said brother, not plural, he would have been correct as Isabella was proclaimed as heir to Castile by a faction of rebelling nobles after the death of her brother Alfonso and would officially become the heir of Enrique once those nobles were successful in their rebellion\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[1:28](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=1m28s)- Ok so there’s something wrong with the statement “the two kingdoms of Spain were united”. That is that there were four kingdoms of the Spains at the time (five if you include Granada). These were Castile, Aragon, Navarra, and Portugal (Portugal wouldn’t truly be separate from the rest of modern day Spain until the end of the Portuguese Restoration War in 1668). Even if we assume Spain to mean the modern day kingdom of Spain, rather than its historical meaning of the entirety of Iberia, and exclude Portugal it still would not be correct as Navarra would remain an independent kingdom until after the death of queen Isabella.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[3:04](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=3m4s)- I can’t find anything in multiple books on queen Isabella regarding her giving birth to twins. None of her notable children were twins and I can’t find any evidence of her having a miscarriage involving twins.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[4:30](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=4m30s)- Isabella was not opposed to fighting wars with other Christians as the video claims. This is possibly the largest mischaracterization in the entire video. She would help her husband fight a war against the Neapolitans and the French in the early years of the 16th century to enforce his claim on the throne of Naples. The reason she didn’t want Fernando to press the issue over the control of Rossello was because she wanted both kingdoms’ militaries focused on the war with Granada.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[5:17](https://youtu.be/6pwu_tJArjY?t=5m17s)- Real Crusades History notable leaves out the violence against the Jews of Grenada after its fall and the violent actions of the inquisition before and after the fall of the Alhambra against the Jewish and Converso populations of Castile.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis last point is really why I really have a problem with the video. It romanticizes Isabella’s reign and excludes some of the terrible things that happened during her reign like the spread of the Spanish inquisition, violence against Jews, a bloody civil war, and the exploitation of American Indians. If the video was only trying to examine the war with Granada then I wouldn’t have an issue with these things, but because it presents itself as a being a biography from her birth to her death I take issue with the whitewashing of Spanish history that the video partakes in and as someone who studies the subject I find that troubling. \nHopefully you all enjoyed reading this short little rundown as much as I enjoyed doing the research for it! Hopefully my next post will be a bit longer. I hope you all have a wonderful day!",

        "text": "Well darn. I don’t know if this entire blog should belong on r/badhistory or r/badphilosophy but when I stumbled upon\nhttp://showmeskeptic.blogspot.ca/2015/05/a-rebuttal-to-dawkins-debunked-by-dr.html\n\nI knew it fit right here. I mean, if he really wants his creditably to hit rock bottom or to start digging deeper after he hit rock bottom, he decided to Dark Ages this thing.\n\n&gt;If this is true, then why was it the Muslims who were the Wests leaders in Science during the Dark Ages? Why were the Chinese more advanced than the West until the Renaissance? In both cases it was when secular ideals of skepticism and curiosity were in favor, and pious obedience to ideas was waning.\n\nI dunno, when’s the dark ages he speaks of? One big problem I got is that they usually just say “dark ages” without specifying the years. Beyond the simple “Wait, what do you mean skepticism and curiosity are secular ideas?”, I really question of this guy remembers a certain Empire called Rome and the influence said Empire’s so-called “collapse” (I prefer to say split into pieces with one side going pop soon and another side remaining for centuries but collapse sounds fancier) and the impact that had on everything. Also before the Renaissance, did none of the inventions in between matter? Not to talk bad about China during those periods but I didn’t know China had better windmills or more architecture with flying buttresses than Europe. I guess China also handled horses way better with their non-European horseshoes or collars too. \n\nSome of the below stuff is some horrible philosophy (Don’t believe in anything unless it’s proven? Goodbye inductive reasoning or the unproven belief that we humans can objectively and rationally observe this world. Also the same “It works bitches” Dawkins does) but the bad history continues after.\n\n&gt;Um, no. The middle ages are proof that science was not born from Christian ideas.  Science often ran counter to Christian doctrine to the misfortune of the scientists, like Copernicus and Galileo. Science did not blossom in Europe until the Muslims reintroduced science to Europe, as they had no problem with science at that time. Also, ancient Greek and Roman writings, knowledge lost in Europe for nearly 1,000 years were reintroduced thanks to the preservation efforts of the Muslims.  \n\n\nGee wiz, Galileo and Copernicus! Two guys who couldn’t refute a bunch of totally-not-scientific-you-guys objections to heliocentrism like the Stellar Parallax and more. Also all those other photo-scientists? The Roger Bacons, the Nicole Oresmes? Or how about guys like Pope Sylvester II? They don’t real apparently.\n\nAlso it was all the Muslims guys. The Christians didn't do squat. The \"Christians\" who did? They were Muslims. This guy here makes his phone booth TARDIS go 88 miles per hour with 1.21 Gigawatts of power and apparently used his mind reading skills to determine that the “Christians” preserving those writings were actually secretly Muslims. \n\nSo while this “educator” and “skeptic” has a crapload of bad philosophy, I say he’s got enough bad history to go around. \n\nEdit: Okay, my wording sucks. I didn't mean to imply that the Muslims didn't do anything. (Especially not after I read about the Islamic Golden Age.) I was making a joke that this guy somehow concluded that the Christians who helped preserve \"them stuffs\" were all secretly Muslims, noting what time travel and mind reading powers he would require to do that. I'll edit it so it doesn't imply that.",

        "text": "So Sam Harris finally had his much-anticipated conversation with Ezra Klein of Vox. The conversation and podcast is lengthy and pretty detailed, and not all of Harris' viewpoints are wrong or negated by his error, but this quote reinforces Klein's point that Harris' views are wrongfully divorced from historical reality.\n\n[Taken from the transcript posted on Vox.](https://www.vox.com/2018/4/9/17210248/sam-harris-ezra-klein-charles-murray-transcript-podcast) (Emphasis Mine)\n\n&gt;The data is whatever the data is, presumably, assuming it was collected adequately. I mean, yes, there were the Nazi doctors. They were real doctors. They were real Nazis. **They were doing real unethical things, and, paradoxically, they probably found some true things in their diabolical experiments.** You can separate these different variables, and my experience in talking to you is that you want to run it all together and give it this moral valence, which is, I have argued and will continue to argue, highly counterproductive.\n\nWhile I don't know about pre-conflict Nazi German science, though Pervitin is a notable medical error, [the Holocaust definitively yielded no medical progress despite the torture inflicted on its victims.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4fwnn4/did_the_nazis_make_any_contributions_to_the/) As commiespaceinvader notes *most of the conclusions the Nazis came to were refuted through ethical means.* Harris is displaying a massive blind spot that permeates the rest of his points in the podcast, and his refusal to consider data without historical context, or actually know what the Nazis did, favors Klein's view that history always needs to be considered.\n\nTo quote the linked essay:\n\n&gt;As for what motivated these doctors to conduct such experiments, it certainly was not the advancement of science. Rather it can be said that it was the obvious reasons that they were Nazis, really hated the people they experimented on, and maybe just wanted to try some stuff. The fact that even those like Rascher of whom at the end of the war it was thought that he was interested in results but used unethical methods, did in fact not only use unethical methods but hardly used any scientific methods at all, points to a motivation more influenced by Nazi ideology and personal cruelty. I mean, even with a scientific goal in mind, it takes a special kind of person to operate on someone without anesthesia and try to transplant a nerve while they are awake or to just dump someone in a decompression chamber.\n\n&gt;Also, it is a seriously baffling phenomenon for how long this myth has been repeated. While it is true that some people have referenced Rasche's study, it has not produced anything that is remotely up to the standards of the time or of today in terms of scientificness. That is even the reason, most people reference it. To show how flawed the experiments were.\n\nLinks to both Sam Harris and Ezra Klein's podcasts:\n\n[Klein](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1081584611)\n[Harris](https://samharris.org/podcasts/123-identity-honesty/)\n\nMany thanks /u/commiespaceinvader for all of his research into the Holocaust and having answers to nearly every bit of horrible minutiae of that cataclysm.",

        "text": "Lots of funny claims but the debunking is a bit difficult simply because of the absurdity of many of the claims, but I try and unpack it below:\n\n\n\n&gt;A brief lesson in history.\n\n&gt;Back in the '70s, communists pretty much ran everything in this country. They had control of our schools, our churches, our government, our businesses, everything.\n&gt;That's when Reagan won. That's also when the \"culture wars\" really started. Up until that point we had been pretty relaxed against the onslought of communist doctrine in our society, but in the 80s, something shifted.\n \nOkay..... wewladdotgif there's a lot to unpack here.\n\nOkay, so first of all, the claim that the 'culture war' didn't exist previous to the 1980's. I mean, wow. Apparently the late 60's/early 70's didn't happen, that whole Vietnam War protest movement and hippies and Nixon and the \"Silent Majority\". i mean, [Nixon gave a speech about it in 1960](http://watergate.info/1960/08/21/nixon-the-meaning-of-communism-to-americans.html), but apparently none of that happened. TIL. \n\u001c\n\nBet let's  continue on...\n\n&gt;First came people like Rush Limbaugh: The lone voices in the wilderness, proclaiming an unfamiliar doctrine. There are tons of these people, but they all acted semi-independently, and all they could do was get the conversation started.\n\n&gt;\bThen they began to have followers, and not just a few. We elected Reagan in the 80s thanks to people like Milton Friedman. 94 brought Newt Gingrinch and the Contract for America -- the first time in 50 years the republicans controlled the house and the senate.\n\n&gt;Since then, leftism has been on the retreat. They used to hold \"Debates\" but over time, they realized they could not make any persuasive arguments for their nonsense. \n\n\nNo examples of these 'debates' that the 'communists' used to hold. I guess there's no evidence needed. The nonsequitor about Friedman is also fun, since it comes out of nowhere, with no context. And Limbaugh actually didn't start his broadcasting career until [*after* Reagan was elected, not before](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFBK_\\(AM\\)#Rush_Limbaugh). And he wasn't nationally syndicated until 1988, the last year of Reagan's presidency. \n\nBut let's disregard all that and move on to some strawmen:\n\n&gt;\bCase in point: Look at how they debate gun control. Do you k\bnow any leftists at all who take any of our points seriously? Do you have any problem at all convincing someone on the fence that the right to keep and bear arms is the right thing to do?\n\n&gt;This new generation -- starting back in the early 2000s -- is violent. They can't win because they can't control the media anymore and they can't control the debate. \n\nthe same media they claim is controlled by leftists? The one the brave voices in the wilderness like Limbaugh, who time traveled back to the pre reagan years?\n\n&gt;They can't win the debate. Now they only have violence.\n\nOkay, so this 'new generation' of 'communists in the US 'started' in the 2000s. Again, hard to debunk because... it's so random and doesn't' even point to any historical facts. \n\nHere's where it gets really fun:\n\n&gt;The thing that they don't understand is we've done this before. This is exactly like what it was leading up to the Civil War. **America had declared that talking about slavery was illegal**. \n\nI've honestly never heard this claim either way and can't even find a reference to anyone saying this, much less debunking it. \n\nAnyone? Bueller?\n \n\n&gt;Well, abolitionists said, \"Screw that. We're talking anyway.\" When they couldn't shut them up, they tried to beat them in debate, but the more they talked, the worse slavery sounded. Then they got violent, and not just against the radicals (who the North could care less for.) \n\n\nSo 'they' (who?) got 'violent' against the abolitionists (who were apparently communists??) Again.... hard to debunk something that is this vague. But I digress...here's where it gets reeaally fun:\n\n&gt;They forced the North to enforce fugitive slave laws and we said, \"Screw that. We're not going to catch your slaves for you.\" And that's when things got violent. \n\nNot sure who this 'we' is who said 'screw that' since the author here seems to be implying the abolitionists owned slaves? It's getting harder to follow a line of logic here.  \n\n&gt;Thank God that this time around the left has already neutered themselves. They were told they weren't getting ready for communism, and so they didn't arm up and practice for the eventual fight that was going to come. So now they are disarmed, incompetent, and incapable of understanding what the fight is going to look like.\n\nSo the 'leftists' abolitionists were 'told' (by who?) that the abolitionist movement wasn't about Communism. Again.... hard to debunk something this comical.   \n\n\n&gt;All we have to do is crack down on violence from the left, expose it, condemn it, punish it, and we'll be fine.\n\n**original post**:http://archive.is/64ukX\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "While doing a bit of studying for an essay on American prehistory, I stumbled upon [this](https://i.imgur.com/J45vKv2.png) brief article concerning the Cree--an indigenous people of North America, written by a History Professor with a Doctorate in Archaeology. You'd think that a history professor would read about the prehistoric culture they are describing to make sure  they get it right, but unfortunately, this does not appear to be the case. This post will focus only on the first paragraph, as it is by far the most egregiously inaccurate.\n\n_\"The Cree probably started out as part of the Athabascan crew. When other Native people spread out south and east, the Athabascans, or Dene, stayed up north. Their language became different. But then later, they moved south and east too. The Athabascans who moved to the Great Lakes became the Cree.\"_\n\nI'm going to look past the author's horrible grammar and jump straight into the reasons this is terrible Cree history.\n\nFirst--genetic, linguistic, and archaeological studies indicate that the Dene people are primarily descended from a wave of Asian migrants around 6500 BC. It isn't accurate to imply that they are simply the direct descendants of early Native Americans that \"stayed up North.\" That's not even to mention the several non-Dene groups indigenous to Northern Canada, most especially the Inuit and Tsimshian.\n\nSecond--The Dene languages and Cree language are as different from eachother as English is from Arabic. While the Dene languages have complex consonant systems featuring aspiration, ejectives, and both voiced and unvoiced consonants, Cree has a very simple consonant system with only 14 consonants total. Most Dene languages have SOV sentence structure, while Cree is very flexible in this regard. I could go on listing differences, but that would be boring. Point is, stating that there exists a provable, close relationship between Cree and the Dene is laughable.\n\nThree--The Cree language is actually a member of the Algonquian family, which linguists _mostly_ believe originated somewhere around the Great Lakes. The Cree most likely originated when Algonquian people migrated north into the Canadian Subarctic, not when Athabascan people migrated southeast. Amazing job Professor.\n\nFourth-In my opinion the worst mistake. The Cree live throughout Subarctic Canada, **BUT NOT THE GREAT LAKES.** Seriously, how can you get this wrong? Even a regular google search about the Cree won't mention the Great Lakes, because they weren't a Great Lakes tribe. It's like this professor is actively trying to botch Cree history as badly as possible. While the Cree were heavily active in Great-Lakes trade with other native Americans, and later Europeans, they were not native to the region and did not ever settle it in significant numbers. Saying that the Cree originated when Athabascans moved to the Great Lakes is as wrong as saying that the English originated when the Mongols moved to Scandanavia.\n\nThis is, without a doubt, one of the single least accurate things I've seen written by someone with a professional degree--by an Associate History Professor no less! How does Bad History this Bad even come to be?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8aew07/planet_dolans_9_shocking_attempts_to_rewrite/",
        "text": "(Seeing as this didn't seem to post when I resubmitted it the first time, I've decided to resubmit it, sorry if this is a repost.)\n\nPlanet Dolan made [a video on bad history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekYq4YHQKLA)! I'm just going to copy and paste the text version from their website here. And before you delete this post, they did have sources which they put in [a pastebin](https://pastebin.com/1iHEGFt2) along with the images they used, I will also put the sources at the end of this post. I believe that this is worthy of being posted here because it's a really well made list of bad history with sources.\n\n(Note that this is a countdown. For some reason the numbers appear reversed when I put it in like that.)\n\n9. China Ended WWII\n&gt; Put away all that talk about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, see what actually happened is that China were the ones to stop Imperial Japan from taking over the Pacific.\nOr at least that’s what was recently said by President Xi Jinping at a military parade celebrating the victory over the Japanese. While 15 million Chinese died during Japan’s invasion that lasted 14 years, the rest of the world would agree that nuclear bombs played more of a role in ending the war.\nMany have seen this as an attempt this as an attempt to rewrite history in order to foster more nationalism in China, it’s not like a google search can’t prove their president wrong….oh wait.\n\n8. Van Gogh’s Ear\n&gt; You’ve probably heard a little “romantic” story about how Vincent Van Gogh was so crazy in love with a woman that he CUT his EAR off for her.\nYeah that one is pure BS, Van Gogh more probably cut his ear off and gave it to a prostitute because he was drunk. Not as romantic, ew…I hope it wasn’t supposed to be a form of payment.\nThough it’s also possible that Van Gogh didn’t cut the ear off himself either, losing it in a duel with fellow painter Gauguin. Either someone tried to rewrite history to make Van Gogh seem like a crazy romantic rather than just artist crazy.\n\n7. War of the Worlds\n&gt; Remember being silly people were in the past because they went into a mass panic over a radio broadcast of “War of the Worlds”?\nMan that sure made old timey people sound stupid, so it’s lucky for them that it never goddamn happened. Newspapers reported the mass hysteria but independent fact checking at the time showed that small audience who tuned in knew it was a real alien invasion.\nThis would be because the station played disclaimers before every ad break and…well because people aren’t that damn stupid. Newspapers only played up the whole thing so that they could bag out their new competition… the radio.\n\n6. The Pink Swastika\n&gt; How could the Nazis commit such terrible crimes against humanity? Well that’s easy, they were evil because they were all raging homosexuals.\nSo says the 100% historically base book “The Pink Swastika” that can be basically summarized as “Hitler was totally gay guys, I can’t prove it at all but that means all homosexuals are bad”. The book also tries to explain away the Nazi party murdering homosexuals by basically saying they only killed feminine men.\nOh right so Hitler was some kind of masculine power top that just had it out for twinks and crossdressers. We’ll explain away bigotry with even more bigotry.\n\n5. The History of the USSR\n&gt; If you lived in The Soviet Union during the Cold War then history was less history and more “shit made up to make communism look better”.\nThe “official” history of Russia started being meddled with as soon as early as 1918 but really started to get messed up after WW2. Corrupting history to paint a different picture every day of the week served the important purpose of allowing the government to justify anything they did.\nMost notably the party wanted to hide things like “The great purge” where the secret police went around torturing people for “anti-soviet activity”. Because stuff like that really gets people down about your leadership.\n\n4. North Korea’s War\n&gt; From one censor happy regime to another, North Korea is still actively rewriting history all the time.\nEspecially when it comes to the Korean War because people will hate South Korea more if you play the victim. Basically their version of events pins the whole war on the United States and South Koreans because they are evil and Kim Jong Un is the sexiest person in the universe.\nThey even go as far to pin every major atrocity of the war on the US military including a massacre where US soldiers used samurai swords to behead North Koreans. Because samurai swords were used frequently by the US army, don’t you know anything about history?\n\n3. Japan’s War Crimes\n&gt; Japan has had its own long history of not being able to deal with what they did in WWII.\nBeing spurred on by strong right wing groups, the debate over what Japan was responsible for has been raging since the war ended. Most notable is the denial of the Nanking Massacre, where anywhere between 50,000 and 300,000 Chinese were killed. Some saying that the Chinese did this to themselves to make Japan look bad. These groups have also called for school textbooks to omit the atrocities committed during this time, over fears that it would cause shame over people’s ancestors.\n\n2. Black Egypt\n&gt; You might have seen some conspiracy nuts posting about this one recently, primarily stating that the Egyptians were actually black skinned Africans.\nThis is an argument used by Afro centrists to show how white people have been lying about history, using the rationalization that Egypt is in Africa so they must have been black. Unfortunately for them science and history tell a different story. Genetic profiling has shown that ancient Egypt pretty much looked the same as modern Egypt.\nSkin color wise, the country actually varied from dark brown to light brown depending on how far north on the Nile you lived. Most of the arguments for this have about as much credibility as saying Hitler was gay.\n\n1. Hitler Saves Europe\n&gt; Speaking of Hitler, did you know he actually saved Europe of the onslaught of Stalin’s communist empire?\nThat’s how some historical revisionists have decided that Hitler actually did Europe a favor by invading Russia…while also simultaneously taking over Europe for himself. You can probably see the logical flaw here.\nThe argument goes that the Nazis found a large amount military infrastructure around Russia’s border. Suggesting that the soviets were planning to invade Europe themselves and Hitler decided to strike, saving Europe from a communist invasion. How dare Stalin try to take over while Hitler was taking over, that’s just rude.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://www.smh.com.au/comment/xi-jinpings-portrayal-of-chinas-role-in-world-war-ii-reflects-presentday-aims-20150910-gjj7fr.html\n\nhttp://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/china-post/frank-ching/2015/09/09/445365/p1/China's-attempt.htm\n\nhttp://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2013/05/20-things-most-americans-dont-know-about-history/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism_%28negationism%29\n\nhttp://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_race_controversy\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Egyptian_hypothesis#Position_of_modern_scholarship",

        "author": "mscott734",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/8a8ohg/steven_crowder_spreads_misinformation_while/",
        "text": "Hello fellow historians! Today I will be examining [this segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8prwEJkJ3Ds) from the show “Louder with Crowder” starring the show’s creator, Steven Crowder. Crowder is perhaps best known for either for being the guy sitting at the table in the “chang my mind” meme or for voicing The Brain on the kids’ show Arthur. Crowder is a regular guest on Fox news and regularly writes for Breitbart. As you’ll see if you watch the video, Crowder also holds some pretty Islamophobic views.  I’ve provided timestamps in the post for any of you who want to watch the video alongside reading this post , but hopefully I’ve provided adequate context in each point so that that isn’t necessary. So with all that out of the way, let’s take a look at the video!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(0:07)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=7s)- Right off the bat, I obviously can’t speak for every University, but in my own personal experience of taking courses on the modern middle East as well as courses on the Medieval Era I’ve never heard modern Islamic terror attacks compared to the crusades as Crowder is claiming. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(1:30)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=1m30s)- Steven should really look up what a crusade is. The expansion of the early Islamic caliphates is obviously not a crusade. It wasn’t sanctioned by the Pope (it wasn’t even done by catholics) and there were no papal bulls issued to support those conquests. For something to be a crusade it has to be ordained by the Pope. Many of the early wars of Islamic expansion may be Jihads, but a Jihad is not a crusade. And calling the oriental crusades for Jerusalem the Second Crusades just makes the numbering system of the crusades way too complicated, especially when what Steven calls “the first crusades” aren’t even crusades.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(2:07)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=2m7s)- The map Steven uses is the same one used by Bill Warner which I have already debunked in a post [here](https://redd.it/86jw4u). But for those of you who don’t want to read all that I’ll sum it up by saying that Warner classifies any conflict in the Islamic world as a Jihad, thus vastly overstating the numbers used for the map.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(2:27)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=2m27s)- Steven shouldn’t be mentioning the Ottomans when discussing islamic expansion prior to the 13th century, and even then they wouldn’t really be relevant until the 14th. He most likely meant to mention the Seljuks instead. Also the Turks were already from Asia, they didn’t need to march into it. He’s probably referring to Asia Minor here.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(2:43)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=2m43s)- How is the fall of Constantinople a motivation for the First Crusade which happened nearly 400 years earlier? Crowder literally calls the fall of Constantinople “the big reason” implying that he believes it's the biggest factor behind the launching of the crusades, which it obviously was not. His timeline during this whole section makes absolutely no sense.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(3:11)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=3m11s)- Steven discusses the desecration of holy sites as if it’s unique to the Islamic world. It’s not. Not to get into whataboutism but Charlemagne ordered the destruction of Irminsul, a holy site to the Germanic pagans, during his wars against the Saxons. I’m not saying that that makes any desecration of holy sites ok, but talking about the practice as if it’s uniquely Islamic is just dishonest.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(3:21)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=3m21s)- In a similar vein, beheading people is also not unique to Islamic. Execution by beheading was used as an execution method all over the world. It was used in Japan, China, England, and perhaps most famously in France all the way up until 1977. Once again not saying beheading people is ok but it’s just dishonest to portray it as a practice unique to the Islamic world.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(3:29)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=3m29s)- Steven’s source for Muslims using unusually cruel methods of torture is the speech Pope Urban II gave at Clermont. That is a textbook example of using a biased and untrustworthy source because of course Urban wants to paint Muslims in a bad light in a speech where he is literally calling for a crusade against them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(3:40)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=3m40s)- I’m sure that this website literally called “the Muslim issue” where Steven gets his numbers on the Arab slave trade from, that states that its goal is to “Encourage a total ban on Islamic immigration” and “Encourage reversal of residency and citizenship to actively practicing Islamic migrants” is going to provide a nuanced and accurate portrayal of Islamic history. But sarcasm aside, the figure I’ve seen more often used in regards to the Arab slave trade is 17 million which is a far cry from the 100 million that Steven claims and the 200 million that his article claims.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(3:45)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=3m45s)- To my knowledge there’s no prerequisite in any undergrad degree I’m aware of (at least none at my university) that requires students to take a course on slavery as Steven claims. There are US history courses which have sections talking about slavery because it’s an important part of American history but no required course specifically on slavery. And yes they do have courses that mention the muslim slave trade, they’re just not introductory level history courses because the muslim slave trade isn’t particularly relevant to American history.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(4:45)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=4m45s)- Vlad Tepes wasn’t one of the few people to fight the Ottomans as Crowder claims. Vlad’s reign began less than a decade after the Crusade of Varna which involved states from all across Eastern Europe fighting against the Ottomans. Many people and countries fought against the Ottomans, Vlad wasn’t one of only a few.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(5:55)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=5m55s)- Despite what Steven says, saying Christians “took Jerusalem” in 1099 isn’t inaccurate. Saying they took it back could be considered inaccurate as the Christians who took Jerusalem in 1099 were Catholic Crusaders and not the Byzantines who had owned the city before the Muslims took it, and seeing as the city wasn’t returned to the Byzantines saying that the Crusades took it back isn’t really accurate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(6:10)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=6m10s)- Also how does the 6 Day War in 1967 relate to the crusades other than happening in the same geographical region? And the territory Israel took in 1967 was not Israeli before it was taken in the war so I fail to see how it relates to saying that the Christians “took back” Jerusalem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(6:31)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=6m31s)- Crowder decides to debunk the “blood up their knees” claim but fails to note that the original quote is blood up to their ankles. And once again, he says they teach this as fact in colleges but from my own personal experience that’s not true. Also the quote was likely hyperbolic and not meant to literally mean that the crusaders were wading in blood.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(8:30)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=8m30s)-  It’s a little funny that Crowder says that the crusades have no influence on Islamic terrorists in the modern era when the site that he showed on the screen (where he was reading the Bill Clinton quote from) clearly stated that Osama bin Laden was using anti-crusader rhetoric in some of his statements. I’m not saying whether I believe they influence the modern day or not, I just find it funny that Steven’s own article disagrees with him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(9:30)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=9m30s)- Crowder talks about genocide as if it’s unique to the Islamic world. It’s not. The Holocaust, the genocide of American Indians, and the Bosnian genocide were all perpetrated by White Christians and Crowder isn’t saying that White people or christians are uniquely barbaric. I hope this goes without saying but I’m not trying to excuse the Armenian genocide, I’m just pointing out that it’s not unique.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(10:09)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=10m9s)- This whole anecdote about beheadings in soccer stadiums as a warm-up act and the players kicking around the severed head as a soccer ball is almost completely fabricated. It seems to be based off the Taliban using a Kabul soccer stadium as the location for their public executions however I can’t find anything saying that this would happen on the same day as soccer games nor anything about the heads actually being used as soccer balls.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(10:55)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=10m55s)- Comparing the Western world to the Islamic world, as Steven tries to do, is almost never going to be accurate.Where Western civilization begins and ends varies greatly depending on who you ask and what area you look at and the same applies to the Islamic world. Even with the Islamic civilizations that bordered the Mediterranean there were huge cultural differences between say Moroccans and Turks, and even more so between Turks and the various Islamic cultures of Africa or South East Asia.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[(11:04)](https://youtu.be/8prwEJkJ3Ds?t=11m4s)- Crowder says that the Islamic world “doesn’t make progress” which historically is just incorrect as Istanbul, Cordoba, and Baghdad in particular were all centers of learning and progress during the height of the Islamic empires that controlled them.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd with that we are done. I have to say, I’m not surprised that a comedian hosting a political talk show got a lot of stuff wrong about the crusades but I am disappointed. Fairly often people will try to use Islamic history and the Crusades as justification for their own Islamophobic beliefs, as Crowder does, and it just pollutes the study of Islamic and Medieval history with disingenuous work designed to spread Islamophobia. Hopefully Crowder will eventually learn some actual Islamic history and not just look at “facts” that support his own misinformed opinion on what Islam is. It probably won’t happen, but it’s be nice if it did. Anyways, sorry for the shorter post this week, I’m in the middle of doing research for another post which I’ll hopefully have done in the next week or two which has been requiring me to do a fair bit more research than I usually need to do for these. But hopefully you’ll all enjoy that when it’s done! Thanks for reading this and I hope you all have a wonderful day!",

        "text": "Sorry for the shit title. I couldn't really come up with anything better.\n\nI swear to god I had an aneurysm over this. I'm trying to stay calm, but as my friends will testify, I had a long all-caps rant over this. \n\nI can't promise that I won't go all-caps rant here either. Sorry.\n\nOkay. So a friend of mine linked me this article today: [\"_The Washington Post_ Slanders Thomas Jefferson Over Slave Children.\"](http://archive.is/OZOxA) \n\nYou already know it's going to be bad when it calls \"slave children\" _slander_, especially when it comes to _Thomas Jefferson_. \n\n(Quick question though: is it really slander if 1) the person has been dead for a few centuries and 2) the Thomas Jefferson Foundation [acknowledges](https://www.monticello.org/site/plantation-and-slavery/sally-hemings) that he very likely did, in fact, have children via raping a slave?)\n\n&gt; In the first sentence, the author writes: “Many people know that Thomas Jefferson had a long-standing relationship with his slave, Sally Hemings. But fewer know that they had four children, three boys and a girl, who survived to adulthood.”\n\n&gt; None of this can be verified. No one knows whether Thomas Jefferson fathered even one child by Sally Hemings.\n\n&gt; [excised: an argument that boils down to IT AIN'T TRUE BECAUSE SCIENCE!]\n\nOkay, so while we will never know with 100% certainty whether Jefferson fathered children with Hemings, we are pretty reasonably sure that he actually did.\n\nThe DNA tests undertaken in the 90s showed that Hemings's male descendants (i.e. everyone descended from Eston) and Jefferson's male descendants were linked. Then we have Annette Gordon-Reed's book _Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy_, which points out why it's probably very likely that Jefferson fathered Hemings's children (cited in the following AskHistorians answers: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/57p5o2/is_there_enough_evidence_to_assume_that_thomas/d8vnj66/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1eu0ab/is_there_conclusive_answer_to_the_jefferson/ca3ryqn/)\\). There's also a very strong oral tradition that Hemings's descendants were sired by Thomas Jefferson. Because of this, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation states:\n\n&gt; Based on documentary, scientific, statistical, and oral history evidence, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation  and most historians believe that, years after his wife’s death, Thomas Jefferson became the father of the six children of Sally Hemings who are mentioned in Jefferson's records.\n\nThe narrowing down is based off of documentary evidence, statistics, oral history, _and_ the DNA evidence. The DNA evidence isn't everything; it's only when we coupled it to the historical record (which includes oral history) that we can get the picture.\n\n&gt; Consider: there is no record of Sally Hemings ever telling anyone that Thomas Jefferson was the father of any of her children. \n\nOther than that oral tradition that I mentioned? Oh, wait, it's an oral tradition, that probably doesn't count.\n\n&gt; There is no record of anyone having seen anything, even the subtlest glance, pass between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings.\n\nThere were [rumors of such of a relationship](https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/james-callender) published in 1802 by James Callender. He also never actually apologized for those rumors. Just saying. \n\nAdditionally, if there were witnesses, many of them might have been slaves, who don't often show up in the historical record for obvious reasons.\n\n&gt; There is almost no evidence that Sally Hemings existed at all. In his thousands of letters and farm books where Jefferson kept accounts, there are only a handful of references to Hemings, all of them perfunctory—food distribution lists and the like.\n\n... HOLY CRAP. \\*implodes*\n\nOKAY, AUTHOR? SHE WAS A SLAVE. SLAVES OFTEN DON'T SHOW UP IN THE HISTORICAL RECORD BECAUSE THEY WERE _LITERALLY PROPERTY_ AND NOT CONSIDERED _PERSONS_. SHE WAS A SLAAAAAAAAVE. SHE WAS AN ENSLAVED BLACK WOMAN LIVING IN THE 18TH CENTURY. DO YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS????\n\nALSO, IF THIS IS ABOUT HOW JEFFERSON DOESN'T MENTION HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER IN HIS LETTERS, HERE'S A THOUGHT. WHILE WHITE SLAVEOWNERS DID OFTEN HAVE SEX WITH THEIR SLAVES, THIS IS STILL A TIME PERIOD WHERE BLACK PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY SEEN AS PROPERTY AND INFERIOR TO WHITE PEOPLE. YOU DON'T GENERALLY GO AROUND ADMITTING THAT YOU'RE RAPING YOUR SLAVES BECAUSE THAT MAKES YOU LOOK BAD FOR WANTING TO HAVE SEX WITH A BLACK PERSON OH NOES. THAT'S WHY THE CALLENDER ACCUSATIONS WERE CONSIDERED DAMNING.\n\nAlso? WE KNOW FOR SURE SHE GODDAMN EXISTED.\n\n\\*walks away for a bit*  \n\\*comes back much calmer*\n\nOkay. \n\n&gt; Consider, too, that at the time Eston was conceived, Thomas Jefferson was 64 years of age and halfway through his second term as president of the United States. \n\nBecause clearly men experience something akin to menopause and stop producing sperm before they reach 64! /s\n\n&gt; Ponder as well that his bedroom, on the main floor of the home at Monticello, opened to the center rooms of the house, which had as many as 50 overnight visitors at a time when Jefferson was president and spending time there. That meant Jefferson’s daughters, their husbands, and his grandchildren were usually staying at Monticello.\n\nBecause clearly, the only place he'd ever have sex would be in his main bedroom! \n\n&gt; In an 1858 letter to her husband, Jefferson’s granddaughter, Ellen Wayles Randolph Coolidge, wrote of the near-physical impossibility of any relations between her grandfather and Sally Hemings, saying, “His apartment had no private entrance not perfectly accessible and visible to all the household. No female domestic ever entered his chambers except at hours when he was known not to be there and none could have entered without being exposed to the public gaze.”\n\nBECAUSE HIS OFFICIAL DESCENDANTS DENIED THAT HE FATHERED KIDS WITH HEMINGS UNTIL AFTER THE 1990s!!!!!!!! THE HISTORICAL CONSENSUS CAN CHANGE!!!!!!! HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW THIS????\n\nI give up. I need a shower. I feel so dirty. :(",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/897jgx/touring_some_bad_history_from_pbs_origin_of/",
        "text": "Last week the PBS Web Series \"Origin of Everything\" posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVwqziMjnm8), exploring an alternate history scenario where Charles Martel is defeated at the Battle of Tours. Now, I love early medieval history and alternate history (shameless plug for my own AH timeline on this very subject: https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/the-palace-has-fallen-a-timeline-without-charlemagne.416427/), but this video is just... not good. It repeats a lot of defunct cliches about the Early Middle Ages and even contradicts itself at points. Anyway, let's begin.\n\n[0:55](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=55)\n\nHere's the first bit of bad history. Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi was not a Spanish Moor. He did not lead Spanish Moors. Ignoring that *Moor* is a term with little to no ethnological value, very little of al-Ghafiqi's army was of Iberian origin. Al-Ghafiqi himself was born in the 'Asir region of what is now Saudi Arabia. His army was composed of an assortment of Berbers, Syrian Arabs and Yemeni Arabs (remember these three groups, they'll be important later). However in the overall video this is a rather minor mistake. It gets a lot worse.\n\n[1:23](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=83)\n\nAbd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi was the *wali* of Al-Andalus and a general as well, but the video phrases it as though al-Ghafiqi was solely responsible for the Umayyad conquest of Iberia. This is untrue. Surprisingly enough, the Umayyads were responsible for the Umayyad conquest of Iberia. Specifically, it was al-Walid I that ordered the invasion, and it was carried out not by al-Ghafiqi but by Tariq ibn Ziyad. al-Ghafiqi would not rise to prominence until almost a decade after the invasion, earning his fame putting down a rebellion in what is now Catalonia. A rebellion that only existed because Tariq ibn Ziyad had already conquered most of the peninsula.\n\nBut that's not the worst part of this section of the video. No, that honor belongs to the claim that the Umayyads were 'looking to expand'. They weren't. Spain was at the end of a lengthy and ill maintained supply line. The Caliphate had only expanded into Spain due to the Visigoths' instability and al-Walid's expansionist desires. By the time of Tours, al-Walid was long dead, and none of his successors had pursued expansion in the west. Tours was not about conquest, it was about loot. Al-Ghafiqi was seeking to plunder, not conquer.\n\n[1:38](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=98)\n\nMost modern historians have not theorized this. Very few historians since the 1970s have.\n\n[1:42](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=102)\n\nOh boy, now we get to talk about maps! This is indeed a map of the Frankish kingdom... from 800. This is Charlemagne's empire, not the Merovingian kingdom. None of Italy, Spain, Saxony, Croatia or Brittany were under the control of the Franks at this time, while Bavaria, Frisia, Provence, Aquitaine and Austria were only loosely connected to the Merovingian throne. Which leads nicely into my next point:\n\nThe Franks weren't unified. The Carolingian majordomos were not well liked in much of the kingdom, which lead to rebellions throughout the land, which were put down and then punished, leading to further resentment. At one point the Patrician of Provence decided to throw his lot in with the Muslims and invited them to garrison his city since the Franks wouldn't. Just three years after Odo of Aquitaine fought alongside Martel at Tours, Odo's son Hunald rose up in arms against the Franks. And then let's not forget what the Frankish law code has driven into the nightmares of CK2 players: Partible Inheritance. The Franks were ruled by one king in theory, but in practice all power was in the hands of the majordomos, whose realm of influence was divided between all eligible male heirs upon death. Martel held power over all Francia, but he did so only because he and his father had fought several civil wars to eliminate his rivals (a point that they make later in this video, funnily enough).\n\n[1:47](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=107)\n\nAnother map problem here. First of all, why are the Muslims marching *out* of Persia and *into* Arabia? I suppose you could argue artistic license, but there's also the fact that  PBS seems to think that Thrace and Morea fell to the Muslims about seven centuries ahead of schedule. I could also complain about the implausibility of the Caliphate conquering literally all of Europe, but this isn't bad *alternate* history, just bad history, and this is already long.\n\n[1:54](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=114)\n\nCharles Martel did not really spread Christianity. The only time he really did was when he ordered the destruction of the Frisian pagans' shrines, and that was more of a retribution for rebellion than religiously motivated.\n\n[2:25](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=145)\n\nIt is now generally accepted that the Frankish forces and the Arab forces were fairly evenly matched in number, and the Arabs were fighting far from home in unfamiliar territory as winter drew near. Frankish victory was by no means a guarantee, but it wasn't a miracle either.\n\n[2:34](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=154)\n\nOh, more maps! This one's better, though it still makes the bizarre choice of having the *Arabs* originating in *Persia*. However, Anatolia was almost entirely under Byzantine control at the time, not just Nicaea as the map implies. Crete, Sicily, the Balearics, Sardinia and Naples were all also part of the ERE at the time of Tours while Corsica and Lombardy were ruled by the Christian Lombards.\n\n[2:45](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=165)\n\n&gt; The Spanish Moors' army was well organized\n\nHahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, no. Hey, it's time to talk about the three groups of the Islamic army again! The army of the Umayyads was composed of Berbers, Syrian Arabs and Yemeni Arabs. None of the three groups got along. The feuds between these three would ultimately lead to the splintering of Al-Andalus into the Taifas in a few centuries, but in even in 732 getting them to work together was a difficult task. Abd al-Rahman al-Ghafiqi was an important commander because he was charismatic enough to force the three groups to come together, and when al-Ghafiqi died his subordinates fell to bickering over what to do next rather than continuing the fight.\n\n[3:38](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=218)\n\nNeither Pepin of Herstal nor Charles Martel were kings. Francia was officially ruled by the Merovingian dynasty at this point. The kings might have been mostly powerless, but they were still kings, and the majordomos were not. This would be like saying that Hideyoshi inherited Tokugawa's empire rather than his shogunate.\n\n[3:49](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=229)\n\nThe Franks were not Francophones. They spoke Frankish, a western Germanic language.\n\n[3:54](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=234)\n\nAgain, Charles did not fight for a crown. He never wanted to be king, that was his son's ambition.\n\n[5:05](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=305)\n\nThe Carolingian Empire kind of loosely united western Europe for a generation before collapsing into the mess that was the pre-Ottonian Germany.\n\n[5:18](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=318)\n\nCharlemagne was not Holy Roman Emperor. He was the Western Roman Emperor (or at least he claimed the title). The Holy part of the Holy Roman Empire wouldn't be added until Frederick Barbarossa in the twelfth century.\n\n[5:30](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=330)\n\nQuite a lot of Christianity's spread during this time was due more to Anglo-Saxon missionaries like Bede and Boniface. The Carolingians certainly helped and made it safer to preach to pagans, but they were not the primary cause of Europe's Christianization.\n\n[6:17](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=377)\n\nI feel as though a million butterflies cried out in silence and were then silenced.\n\n[7:21](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=441)\n\nEurope may have had lower standards of living than the Islamic World at this time, but it was far from devoid of art, technology and culture. In fact, there was an event known as the Carolingian Renaissance under Charlemagne that saw the spread of literacy, innovations in art and architecture and legal and and economic reforms throughout western Europe.\n\n[7:54](https://youtu.be/YVwqziMjnm8?t=474)\n\nArab philosophers did preserve Greco-Roman knowledge, but so did the Byzantines, and so did the Christians, and all of them knew of each other and quoted each other. Western European texts often regarded Islamic scholars like Avicenna (Ibn Sina) alongside Plato and Aristotle.",

        "text": "&gt; During the second battle of Ypres, German forces that occupied the surronding area unleashed a chemical attack on French Colonial Troops and supporting Canadian forces. The men had no idea what was happening and of course paniked. This left a sizable gap on the front, but since German high command did not know how effective this would have been so there were not enough support units to back up the attack. Out of a defense force of about 10,000 or so troops nearly 6,000 were killed in the attack. There was no protection from the gas itself so at best the men who knew a little about chemistry advised others to urinate into handkerchiefs and place them over their mouth and nose.\n&gt; \n&gt; While this is the first true use of chemical weapons in the war, it wasn't the first actual use. Smaller attacks (and by small I mean one person attacks) of tear gas had been deployed earlier, but with little to no sucess. Before the advant of gas shells, gas cylinders had to be hauled in by hand to the front and opened up. Each cylinder weighed about 90 pounds and had to be opened up according to wind direction. The men who opened these containers up usually would be gassed themselves and almost always resulted in death. An interesting side note to that is when the British decided to use their own chlorine gas during the battle of Loos in September, after they deployed their weapons, the wind shifted and British forces ended up gassing themselves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWelp... this is really too much to dissect all in a go, but I'll try to get through at least a portion of the second paragraph.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLet's start with:\n\n&gt; Smaller attacks (and by small I mean one person attacks) of tear gas had been deployed earlier\n\nMaybe by tear gas, they mean Ni-shells? I'm going to assume as much so that instead of also discussing French use of tear-gas like irritants very early in the war, I can try to keep this post focused primarily on early German chemical weapon development. German Ni-shells, or “Ni-Schrapnell,” were named for Nernst, who had devised the mechanism of delivery (105mm shells – as were used by German field howitzers – containing 550g of powdered dianisidine chlorosulfonate) and also in reference to dianisidine chlorosulfonate being an irritant which would result in tear-gas like effects including, somewhat less seriously,  “Niesen” – or sneezing.\n \nAs about 3,000 Ni-shells were used against British and Indian troops in and around Neuve Chapelle on 27 October, 1914 (admittedly to such little effect that their use was not known outside Germany until after the war), that would have to have been a very busy and industrious one person.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; Before the advant of gas shells, gas cylinders had to be hauled in by hand to the front and opened up.\n\n\nI’m assuming that by “gas cylinders” they mean chlorine cylinders, or F Batteries, which were indeed deployed at 2nd Ypres. However, by the time testing of these chlorine cylinders at the Wahn artillery range had begun, testing of T-shells (which initially contained the irritant xylyl bromide, though they would later switch to xylyl bromide and bromoacetone in an attempt to make them actually work at all in cold weather) had already been underway for several weeks. And T-shells (possibly up to 18,000 in total) would indeed be deployed first against the Russians at Bolimow. Perhaps again by our favorite lone, industrious attacker, but perhaps slightly *more* likely by several divisions of Mackerson’s Ninth Army.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo if gas shells – albeit not very effective ones – had already been tested and deployed, why use cumbersome cylinders? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nWhile shell production, which was essential to the war effort, still had crucial limitations, cylinders were widely used for chemical storage in an industrial capacity and thus were readily available, as Fritz Haber, who oversaw the development of the F Batteries, notably recognized. \n\n\nAdditionally, among the German high command (Oberste Heeresleitung or OHL), there was also still hesitation about violating the 1899 Hague Declaration Concerning Asphyxiating Gases and the 1907 Hague convention on Land Warfare (which included a prohibition of the use of “poison or poisoned weapons”) at this point in the war for a variety of reasons, including public opinion both at home and abroad, uncertainty about the Allies' ability to develop and mass produce chemical weapons of their own, and a lingering distaste for the unchivalrous nature of the weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs Ulrich Trumpener notes in his excellent paper on 2nd Ypres,\n\n\n&gt; As far as the prohibition of \"poison or poisoned weapons\" was concerned, the OHL took the position that this clause applied only to the deliberate poisoning of food or water, the use of missiles steeped in a poisonous substance, and the like, but that it clearly had no bearing on \"gas\" warfare, since the matter of \"asphyxiating or deleterious gases\" had been dealt with in an entirely separate agreement. The wording of that agreement, in turn, made it possible to maintain that the prohibition expressed therein did not apply to the particular gas weapons the OHL intended to use. The T-shells, at Falkenhayn's insistence, contained both a gas-producing compound and an explosive charge for fragmentation effect (hence they could be said to serve a dual purpose), while the release of chlorine gas from stationary cylinders did not involve \"projectiles\" at all.^1\n&gt; \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI think going too much further into the OHL’s often contradictory views concerning the use of chemical weapons would probably make my very first post far too long, so I’ll leave off with one more note on the use of chlorine cylinders.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; The men who opened these containers up usually would be gassed themselves and almost always resulted in death.\n\n\nThe steel cylinders were definitely difficult to transport to the forward trenches and the work of burying them in the ground had to be carried out at night. And accidental releases of small amounts of gas – in some cases caused by enemy fire – did actually result in casualties and widespread animosity toward the whole project. \n\nHowever, recalling the first larger scale test of the cylinders, which was carried out in the Gheluvelt sector at Ypres on 2 April, 1915, both Haber and Bauer recount a mostly successful test barring their own encounters with drifting gas, which both were accidentally exposed to. They notably fail to report everyone who manned the cylinders dying en masse. And on 22 April, 1915, they would go on to oversee the release of an estimated 150 tons of compressed chlorine gas along the northern edge of the Ypres salient.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have to add, a good part of what bothers me about the original post isn't actually any particular inaccurate detail; rather it's the overarching presentism. It's the tone that grabs you by the ears and yells, \"Wow, isn't it ridiculous all the idiotic and totally preventable ways these people managed to die?!\" which upsets me a bit.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n________________________________________________________________\nSource of the original reddit post (I hope I am doing this correctly; I've never used the Way Back Machine website before, so appologies if not.): \n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20180403004454/https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/sn95u/on_top_of_today_being_earth_day_97_years_ago_on_a/ \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n1.\tTrumpener, Ulrich. \"The Road To Ypres: The Beginnings Of Gas Warfare In World War I.\" The Journal of Modern History 47, no. 3 (1975): 460.\n\n\n2.\tTucker, Jonathan B.

All other firearms were left unregulated\n&gt;\t\n&gt;\tGet your facts straight\n\n[I saw this tweet recently](https://archive.is/RGWVw). And the premise is sort-of-kind-of true; the Nazis did make it easier to get a gun -- especially compared to the previous incarnations of German firearm law (Waffengesetz). But the historical context of guns in Germany is an important one that is usually glossed over. \n\nThe Treaty of Versailles went into effect on the 10 of January of 1920, and included in it was the separation of the German civilians from the military as stated in article 177 of the treaty itself\n\n&gt;\tEducational establishments, the universities, societies of discharged soldiers, shooting or touring clubs and, generally speaking associations of every description, whatever be the age of their members, must not occupy themselves with any military matters.\nIn particular they will be forbidden to instruct or exercise their members or to allow them to be instructed or exercised, in the profession or use of arms.\nThese societies, associations, educational establishments and universities must have no connection with the Ministries of War or any other military authority.[1]\n\nThe new Weimar government bolstered this on the 5th of August of 1920 wherein the new appropriately named “~~Gefeß~~ Gesetz über die entwaffnung der Bevölkerung” translating roughly to “Law about the disarmament of the population” ~~(Gefeß must be old-german, because I can’t find anything about the word other than legal documents so I’m assuming what it means)~~ (EDIT: I cant read fraktur)went into effect[2]; From my translation and research the law accomplishes the following pertaining to civilian arms, (maybe a real German speaker who can read fraktur fonts can roast me about my translation)\n\n* Orders the people to turn in weapons that the government deems “Military Weapons”\n*  Only those whose jobs require them to be armed, and those in the Reichswehr (Wiemar military) can carry weapon or deliver them.\n* Per the treaty of versailles, the production of weapons or trade of weapons is disallowed unless approved by the former entente countries (section 168 of the treaty)\n\nThe law was generally effective -- despite there being no firearm registry -- by the end of the year 932 mortars and flamethrowers, 1,680 machine guns, 18,000 sub-machine guns, 78,000 pistols, and 2.2 million rifles where turned in (and 46 million rounds of ammunition)[3]. But as there was no registry for firearms (and no real obligation to register firearms) the was still many illegal guns. The requirement for registry and subsequent punishments for non-registration came with the “Gesetzes über Schußwaffen und Munition”(of 1928)[4], a loosening of the total-ban of 1919. This allowed the average person to get a permit for a firearm. Later on, once the street fighting between the Sturmabteilung (and aligned groups) and the Rotfrontkämpferbund(and it’s successor groups) reached its pique the government saw it necessary to add a provision to the law in late 1931 stating(§ 2)[5];\n\n&gt;\t\"Weapons (ammunition) acquisition certificates or weapons licenses may only be issued to persons whose reliability is unquestionable and only if a need is demonstrated.\"\n\n Once the Nazis took over in 1933, the disarmament of the Jews was not immediate. But many Jewish gun owners were ordered to report their rifle permits and other gun licenses to the police or the police flat out revoked weapon permits of Jews(as is allowed in the 1928 law). By 1936 the Gestapo had prohibited the issuance of firearm licenses to Jews[6]. The Waffengesetz (of 1938) loosened laws extensively in comparison to the previous incarnations of the Waffengesetz. To the the average german citizen -- and especially those apart of the Wehrmacht, SS, party members or really anyone associated with the government(§ 19) -- it was much easier to get weapons. But of course, some groups (§ 15) such as the Gypsies could not obtain a permit; and presumably had existing firearms confiscated. (EDIT: see correction at bottom)[7]\n\nLegislation specifically targeting the Jews and firearms was not passed until late 1938. The “Verordnung gegen den Waffenbesitz der Juden” essentially forbade the Jews from owning any weapon[8]; \n\n&gt;\t“§ 1 Jews are prohibited the acquisition, possession and carrying of firearms and ammunition as well as blow [as in clubs?] or thrust weapons [knives?]. You must immediately deliver the weapons and ammunition in your possession to the local police authority.”\n\nSo in conclusion, the premise that the Nazis disarmed the people is a little idiotic, because they flat out didn't -- they made it easier for the people to be armed. But what is equally idiotic is implying that nobody was disarmed by the nazis. Could the Jews have done much? No probably not, the much better armed and organized [Warsaw Ghetto uprising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising) was put-down hard. There’s a few bad history posts going over that detail too if you wanna go [searching](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/87ea52/german_gun_laws_effected_poland_and_soviet/) for them. I did leave out bits about the abdication of Wilhelm II and the revolution because I didn't think it was that important, but more likely than not the reason for the hard crackdown on weapons in 1920 [2] is because of the mutinies and street battles of well armed veterans versus union-associated militas that characterized the revolution of 1918-19. \n\nEDIT: /u/laertes78 has corrected some of my assumptions as well as added some extra details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/88jo1o/saying_waffengesetz_without_context_does_not_make/dwluo0m/).

        "text": "The culprits from a forum I would like to not name because I want no trouble. It is a nice place but when people started discussing historical stuff in a game forum, it went awkward. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/KFIwU\n\n&gt; but Dong Zhuo being competent is new to me\n\nWell son, it's new to me too. Probably because Dong Zhou would hardly be considered as a competent ruler/general/commander by any mean. Dong Zhou first notable campaign and his only win was against the barbarians. After that, he was ordered to fight the Yellow Turban rebel but lost. Later, he and Huangfu fought against Han Sui but the campaign dragged on with no clear winner until Huangfu was replaced by another general. The campaign ended and imperial court failed to pacify Han Sui. Dong Zhou next notable campaign was a co-op campaign against Han Sui (part 2). Thanks to Huangfu, Han Sui was forced to retreat. Much later, Dong Zhou directly led his army against Sun Jian but lost as well. \n\nThat was his military \"ability\". How about his other aspect? While it's brilliant of him to take control of the little emperor and the capital from the stronger lords, he failed to keep it at that and only made it worse from there. But I will save it for later.\n\n&gt; He was a bit famous for his strength and got hired as Dong Zhuo's bodyguard\n\n\"A bit\" is not something I would considered to describe Lu Bu. He was known for his strength even when he was young. He defeated Dong Zhou army in while he was still with Ding Yuan. And no, Lu Bu was not \"hired\", he was actually adopted by Dong Zhou. And Lu Bu was not a bodyguard but a general. \n\n&gt; Xu Rong was the real undefeated general under Dong Zhuo\n\nWell, may be he is, except when he was defeated and killed in his last battle...you can say he's undefeated until he's defeated.\n\n&gt; his action following his escape from Chang An he went to Yuan Shu probbaly becauae Yuan Shu did the best against Dong Zhuo - through Sun Jian\n\nBut son, he also fought against Yuan Shu later, then allied with Yuan Shu again. I dont know but may be this Lu Bu dude has a problem with loyalty and consistency or something.\n\n&gt; What makes Dong Zhuo notable is that he manage to suceed where Zhuge Liang utterly failed at. He had a hugely succesful military campaign, he did beat the Alliance against him until Sun Jian arrives\n\nYeah, right. Running away successfully while loosing troops left and right is hugly successful. Son, where were you when Zhuge Liang was having fun at Red Clifft, took Jinzhou and other areas and created Shu, pacified Meng Huo, ect..ect...man, I love history revisionism so much. It's so easy to nitpick someone fault and ignore every other great feats they archived to shame them. Poor Zhuge Liang, at least he's loyal to his young lord and wanted the best for Shu unlike a certain other asshole.\n\n\n&gt; unlike Zhuge Liang he only recruited competent guys instead of his cronies\n\nYeah right, let us stop pretending that Dong Zhou was offed by his own adopted son. Let us stop pretending that his general (Zhu Jun) turned against him. Let us stop pretending that his \"competent guys\" turned on each other and literally killed everyone they know like a bunch of....cronies. Li Jue, Guo Si, Zhang Ji and Fan Chou turned on Lu Bu, killed Xu Rong and Wang Yun.  Li Jue then killed Fan Chou in a party. Then Li Jue and Gou Si fought each other. Li Jue then killed by his subordinate Duan Wei while Gou Si was betrayed and killed by Wu Xi. What a happy lot! \n\nThis is the best people! I only hire the best people! - President Dong Zhou in his 2016 speech.\n\nSource: Record of Three Kingdoms. ",

        "text": "I found this gem in the *Museum of the Spanish Army* in Toledo:\n\n &gt; In the middle of the 18th century, rivalries between France and Britain and race for colonial supremacy, sparked off a series of international conflicts that came to be known as Seven Year's War. **Overseas, the English attacked the Philippines and Cuba, goading Spain into war in 1762. The following year, Charles III obtained the Treaty of Paris, forcing Britain to abandon Cuba and Manila.** Elsewhere Spain was forced to hand over Florida and its possessions to the east of the Mississippi to Britain, receiving Louisiana from France as compensation.\n\nFormatting mine.\n\nR5: \n\n &gt; Overseas, the English attacked the Philippines and Cuba, goading Spain into war in 1762.\n\n * The \"Britain = aggressor\"-narrative is so simplistic as to border on being false. Firstly: Britain did not \"goad\" Spain into war. Britain officially declared war on Spain and did not play any tricks. However, before the declaration of war Spain had already signed a treaty with France (\"Family Compact\") that included a secret clause to attack Britain that would have triggered a little later. And Britain had reasons to suspect this. When it demanded Spain to promise that it not intend to attack Britain and Spain refused, Britain declared war. Spain was not \"goaded\" into war, it is a surprisingly straightforward example of a preemptive strike (Well, as much as you can call cumbersome 18th century warfare a \"strike\"). \n\n * Furthermore, Spain signed the Family Compact/Britain declared war *before* the attacks on Havana and Manila, so the sentence is wrong no matter how you frame it.\n\n * It also conveniently neglects to mention that Spain attacked Portugal but could not make meaningful gains. Or the fact that the British did not just *attack* Cuba and the Philippines but actually *captured* their local capitals, thus entrenching themselves in their commercial and administrative centers.\n\n&gt; The following year, Charles III obtained the Treaty of Paris, forcing Britain to abandon Cuba \n\n * This is an … interesting interpretation of the Treaty of Paris. The Spanish did not *force* the British to abandon Cuba and Manila. Instead, the British left because a treaty had been signed. Spain did not *impose* anything on the British out of a position of strength and the Treaty was ultimately an admission of defeat. The British were not terribly keen on staying in Cuba because they kept dying by disease at an appalling rate and they had already conquered more territory than they could swallow, but there was trade to be made and honor at risk and if the Treaty had not been signed with terms favorable to the British then they would very likely have been prepared to stay there indefinitely. And their primary negotiation partner was not Charles III, but France. This isn't even helped by the next senetence that rightfully hedges the loss of Florida by the gain of Louisiana. It still makes it sound as though Spain had won the war and repelled the evil invaders.\n\n&gt; and Manila\n\n * Manila deserves special mention because it is a special case. By the time the Treaty of Paris was signed, the negotiators in Europe did not yet know that a British expedition had already conquered Manila, because the message took months to arrive in Europe (in fact the British forces had arrived at Manila before the Spanish garrison even knew that they were in a state of war - such are the perils of far-flung empires). Hence, it was not the Treaty of Paris, but general legal principles that \"forced\" the British to leave. (Even though admittedly, the British position in Manila was very weak and they probably could have been forced to retread eventually.)\n\nPS:\n\n&gt; Elsewhere Spain was forced to hand over Florida and its possessions to the east of the Mississippi to Britain, receiving Louisiana from France as compensation.\n\n* By now I’m feeling pedantic: Technically, France did not hand over Louisiana to Spain in the Treaty of Paris but in separate treaty. However, the two treaties were intended to work together, so this is indeed nitpicking.\n\nSource: Fred Anderson, *Crucible of War: The Sven Years’ War and the Fate of Empire in British North America 1754-1766*",

        "text": "In the Vikings TV show, they can load crossbows by pulling the string back with one hand, which is maybe 20 or 30 lbs at most; and they can shoot through armor.  They can do it once every 6 seconds, so it's like a machine gun when they have just 20 people doing it.  Not only that, but tacti-cool!  As troops could run while loading.  Lots of ammo too, and you don't even see them carrying it.  I'd like to imagine a team loader lugging a belt of crossbow bolts along.\n\nSo yeah... apparently the franks invented some kind of energy creation device unheard of in modern times.  Magic crossbows!  \n\nUnless you go by actual history (based on what little I know)...\n\n-----\n\nSmall arms crossbows (not the 'ballistae' kind) could probably fall into three general categories - light, medium and heavy.  \n\nThe 'light' ones would have a stirrup (or no stirrup; early bows were said to be this way) and involve both hands gripping at the string. \n\nThe 'medium' would use what's called a Goat's Foot Lever, which draws the string (and is about as fast to load as a light bow). Though other mediums might have had a belt and a hook (dunno how that was done). Then there's probably other versions out there too - as a rule of thumb, the lever and hook are both simple machines, so any others would probably involve some kind of simple application.  Mediums are already hard enough for human arms and hands to draw, probably in the 300lbs weight range.  Also keep in mind that a crossbow shoots at the power of about 1/4 or 1/3 of its draw weight; mostly because the draw length is much less than that of a longbow or other bow - except when you're considering the ancient greek gastraphetes; which forced the person to lay on the ground to load, due to the bow being so wide and long (pre-medieval crossbows seemed to have had the right idea about crossbows and draw length; most of them are much larger - often knocking them out of the small arms category).  A longbow is far more efficient than a medieval style stand-up crossbow, but we don't ever see machine-assisted longbows.\n\nThe 'heavy' would be complex machine assisted, eg. with a pulley or a crank winch. The heavy took the longest, but you could pause in the middle of drawing the string, as the machine held it in place. Strings for the heavy bows also (iirc) were really THICC... I guess, because thinner ones would snap under that kind of tension.  Heavy designs like the winch and crank involved metal gears, which I imagine could get expensive.  Heavies could have draw weights of up to 1000 lbs, which takes it well beyond the power of a longbow.  But yet another thing to keep in mind is that crossbow bolts are generally shorter than arrows and without any fletching, which (as is claimed), limits the flight trajectory in terms of not only range but also how it performs at the volley - a youtuber called 'Lindybeige' theorized that it wouldn't fly point down very reliably, either.  Evidence for this was the ancient desire for projectiles to be specially weighted towards their tips, as in the late roman plumbata darts with lead weights, and english longbow arrows - which weren't cut straight shafted, but with a slight bulge near the tip (gay).  Generally, heavier projectiles will fair better in volleys, as gravity takes the wheel.\n\nAnd finally, there's the ever important penetration capability.  A shorter projectile fairs worse, but even so - short bolts meant that a soldier could carry more, and lack of fletching (usually just some fins at the end of the shaft instead) made them a lot cheaper.  Despite all this, the heavy has the most oomph, so it'd be realistic if they were the most reliable armor piercers and were the 'sniper weapon' (big flat trajectory).  However, they also probably took a full minute to load, since they had to place the contraption onto the bow and mount it with the string, then wind it up, then remove it again to put the bolt on to delightfully let string twang and bolt/quarrel fly (and be careful, because the windlass/pulley version, which might have been the most powerful, had a lot of fiddley ropes that could get caught on the bow, which must have been exciting).\n\nThe others were more like 15 seconds - but keep in mind that a lot of the argumentation surrounding agincourt and crecy (and those battles) seems to be that longbows were faster shooters; though I think the archers would get fairly tired after something like 10 shots or so.",

I belive one of the reasons Japan didnt invade America during WW2 was because everybody had a gun\n\nThis comment was posted below a post in the insanepeoplefacebook subreddit in which an insane person on Facebook tried to argue that \"nobody\" has invaded the US ever because of gun owners. That's obviously ridiculous and the post was mocking it, but then this little piece of wisdom decided to crop up.\n\nObviously Japan didn't launch a full-scale invasion of the US, but it was hardly because of US gun-owners. There were the obvious factors - the hugeness of the USA being one of them (which would make it difficult to occupy) - but there were the less clear, less taught ones as well. Namely, Japan suffering from a lack of resources, oil in particular^^1 - which was itself an impetus for Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor^^2 . Another being the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy being bogged down in the War in Asia, and overextended^^3 . These lack of resources, America's abundance thereof and Japan's over-extension made the likelihood of Japan winning a long, drawn-out war with America impossible. According to Prof. Chihiro Hosoya in *The Road to War: Japan*, Japan had never intended to launch a full-scale invasion, as \"even most [Japanese] military leaders had little confidence that Japan could fight a long war with America.\" Japan had instead hoped to win enough early victories against America that it could offer a peace after a year or so of fighting^^4 .\n\nReally not that much to say here, just that the abundance of gun owners in 1940s USA wasn't the reason Japan didn't launch a full-scale invasion of the American mainland.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\n1.

        "text": "It's spring, the nights are getting shorter, the days are getting warmer, and fluffy bunnies are hopping around laying  brightly colored eggs.  Yes, it's Easter season!  Time for the annual round of Easter badhistory.   \n\nNow, your standard Easter badhistory is old news at this point.  But every so often somebody comes out with something so crazy it's worth digging into.  \n\nI was informed of this badhistory in a recent TIL thread about Easter that I'm not going to link to because I was involved in the discussion.  But I will link to the page cited in the thread:\n\n[What Does the Easter Bunny Have To Do With Easter?](https://www.seeker.com/what-does-the-easter-bunny-have-to-do-with-easter-1771111729.html)\n\nThere's a bunch of stuff in there that I've heard before, but what stuck out (and what was cited in reddit) is this particular line:\n\n&gt;According to the University of Florida's Center for Children's Literature and Culture, the origin of the celebration - and the origin of the Easter Bunny - can be traced back to 13th-century, pre-Christian Germany, when people worshiped several gods and goddesses.\n\n13th Century Germany was not pre-Christian in any sense (and no, they don't mean 13th century BC here, as they go right into talking about 15th century a few lines down).  For example, Cologne housed churches on the site of the Cologne Cathedral going back to the 6th century, with references to a bishop going back to the third.  And the current cathedral began construction in the 13th century itself [source](https://www.koelner-dom.de/geschichte/a-brief-history-of-cologne-cathedral/?L=1).  The Franks officially became Christian in 496 with the conversion of Clovis, and while there's no doubt that pagan practices continued afterwards, especially among commoners, the thirteenth century is _700_ years later.  Even if pagan practices were hanging on, a region that \"officially\" converted _700_ years earlier cannot be called pre-Christian.  I mean, 13th century Germany was the heart of the HRE, and the Emperors were crowned by the Pope!  If your ruler is crowned by the Pope, you aren't pre-Christian.\n\nIt's also worth noting that I can't even find anything from the University of Florida's Center for Children's Literature and Culture on the topic of Easter, and the article provides no link.  \n\nAlso found on the website:\n\n&gt;According to History.com, Easter eggs represent Jesus' resurrection. However, this association came much later when Roman Catholicism became the dominant religion in Germany in the 15th century and merged with already ingrained pagan beliefs.\n\nAs I noted before, Roman Catholicism was certainly dominant long before the 15th century.  Heck, by that point we are only decades away from Roman Catholicism beginning to lose ground in Germany to _Protestants_. ",

The premise is that Germany's gun laws prohibiting Jews (and others I guess) from owning guns allowed the Germans to murder 11 million or so people.\n\nThere's a lot of issues with this premise however two big ones.\n\nFirst, I'm fairly sure the wiemar republic banned guns long before 1933. I know the Nazis kept it to some degree, but the commonly seen additional argument that the  Nazis used newly created law to move the Holocaust along feels wrong. Can't find anything besides wiki for that however\n\nBut more importantly German laws had little effect n those who made up the vast majority of the killed: Polish and Soviets. Germans were simply not a large percentage of the Holocaust!\n\nThe [United States Holocaust memorial museum](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/mobile/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008193) has some information that seems as good as any.\n\nJewish 6 million\nSoviets 7 million (1.3 million jewish)\nSoviet POW 3 million.\nNon Jewish Poland 1.8\n\n[Another site lists](https://www.thoughtco.com/number-of-jews-killed-during-holocaust-by-country-4081781) with sources, the Jewish  separated by nation to it's best ability: It Breaks down into Soviet 1.3, 3 Polish 3, Austria and Germany .2, and so forth.\n\nIf all of this is true the Germany's gun laws had the possibility to effect a total of around 200,000 Jews and unknown but still in hundred thousand no Jewish Germans. While not great, it is a far cry from what the image wants to suggest and would not have stopped the Holocaust!\n\n(Sorry for the web only links, my phone's a bit bad for PDF!)",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/878ucb/more_taiping_badhistory_in_an_actual_published/",
        "text": "So, my last post refuted some basic factual errors made on a website describing an architectural award. This time, I'm going after the *Dictionary of World Biography*, compiled by Barry Jones. Unlike the website, where the errors turned up twice, Jones' entire entry for Hong Xiuquan is a piece of badhistory from start to finish, with an error almost every other sentence, varying in magnitude from mere trivia to utter nonsense. For those interested it is on page 406 of the 3rd edition, and can be found on JSTOR [here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1rfsrst.12). Now, as much as I'd love to reproduce it in its entirety I think that would spoil it a bit, so I'll do it sentence by sentence.\n\nWe start with the top of the entry:\n\n&gt;**Hong Xiuquan** (Hung Hsiu-ch’uan) (1812-1864).\n\nAt the very least this is factually correct. Neither the Pinyin nor Wade-Giles are misspelled and the dates are correct (Wikipedia claims 1814, based on Hong being 22 in 1836, but the actual reference says that Hong was 24 that year.)^1\n\n&gt;Chinese leader of the Taiping rebellion, born near Guangzhou (Canton).\n\nAgain, not factually incorrect, although it would have been worth stating at the very least that Hong was not just a Chinese subject but Han, and indeed that he was a Hakka. The lack of capitalisation on 'rebellion' is unusual but ultimately just a nitpick.\n\n&gt;With messianic claims and a social and political program not unlike Communism, he claimed to be ruler of ‘the great peaceful heavenly empire’.\n\nThe author never quite notes that Hong was inspired by Christianity – this is the closest he ever gets. Aside from that, the idea that the Taiping were proto-Communist is at best wishful thinking by the Mao era or an attempt by modern Taiping historians in China to get much-needed attention and money when they would otherwise be neglected by the government. The phrase 'great peaceful heavenly empire' (again, not capitalised for whatever reason) is awkward in English but perhaps the most *structurally* accurate rendition of 太平天囯 I've seen. What's the problem with the term? Simply put, the reason it's most often called the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom is that the Taiping *rejected the title of emperor* (皇) and insisted on using 'king' (王) for their leaders instead. Using 'claimed to be' is also quite shady and in some ways quite dismissive of what was for all intents and purposes a functioning state.\n\n&gt;Taipings, as his followers came to be called, soon numbered tens of thousands.\n\n'Came to be called'... by whom? Until 1851 they were still the God-Worshipping Society, whilst the Imperials would simply have called the Taiping 'Long-Hairs' or 'Yue Rebels'. And how soon was 'soon'? It wouldn't have taken that much longer to state that Hong started preaching in 1844 and rebelled in 1851, would it?\n\n&gt;They marched from Guizhou in the south to the Yangtze, and by 1853 had seized Nanjing, where a massacre took place that showed the underlying savagery of the leader.\n\nTwo problems here, one far more severe than the other. Firstly, the Taiping marched from *Guiping*, a city in Guangxi, rather than the entirely separate province of Guizhou. Secondly, the 'massacre' at Nanjing was almost entirely restricted to the Manchus in their 'Inner City' and even Zeng Guofan's estimate (likely the highest contemporary one) puts the deaths at 30,000 in a city of 500,000 inhabitants. More importantly, it is arguable whether Hong was even responsible by that point – Yang Xiuqing was already effectively supreme military commander. Furthermore, according to Jian Youwen this was the only mass killing of Manchus that was committed by the Taiping.^2 What I take most issue with is the idea that the massacre was Hong's fault. Sure, I'm not utterly dismissive of the idea of Great Men, but were not the Taiping who besieged the inner citadel culpable as well? More importantly, a lot of those Manchus burned down their own houses and killed themselves rather than die at the hands of the Taiping – the Taiping were not directly responsible for all of the deaths. (EDIT: To be clear the arson began before the Taiping breached the inner city, and with apparently no precedent for such massacres it cannot be said that they were culpable for all the deaths.)\n\n&gt;For 11 years in Nanjing, Hong exercised an increasingly unpredictable despotism over some 20,000,000 people.\n\nDid he? Yang Xiuqing was *de facto* head of the Taiping until 1856, with Hong a mere symbol. Indeed, Yang repeatedly used his apparent status as vessel of God to pull rank on Hong.^4 The only real 'unpredictable' things one can say happened were Hong's assassination of Yang Xiuqing, Wei Changhui and Qin Rigang and the massacres of their followers in 1856. Even after that, Hong was basically powerless, a puppet of his brothers, and was later simply overshadowed in terms of actual responsibility in civil authority by Hong Rengan and in military command by Li Xiucheng from 1859 onwards.\n\n&gt;At last in their helplessness the Chinese Government enlisted the help of a British officer, Charles Gordon, who trained ‘the ever victorious army’, the main factor in bringing about the defeat of the Taipings and the suicide of their leader.\n\nHoly shit. Where to begin? There is no mention of Zeng Guofan, whose army actually defeated the Taiping in 1864, nor Li Hongzhang, whose 70,000-strong Anhui Army the (at most) 5000-strong EVA was a mere auxiliary to. Gordon may have attempted to train the EVA, but he did not enter the picture until late in 1862, with the actual legwork having been done by the American mercenary Frederick Ward in 1861-2. Indeed, Gordon was so incapable of managing the EVA, both in terms of maintaining Imperial backing and keeping his officer contingent in line (Ward's old second-in-command, Henry Burgevine, actually defected to the Taiping with 125 of his Western officers for a brief period in 1863), that he and his superiors had basically resolved to dissolve it by 1864.^5 More importantly, even Stephen Platt, who argues that Western support *was* essential to the Qing victory, does not credit the EVA with being more than just a bit part in said Western support, in which regular forces (particularly the Royal Navy) and arms exports were far more significant.^6 Beyond his problematic opinions, the author ends on a further factual error. Hong did not consciously commit suicide, but died (most likely) of food poisoning after concluding that weeds were manna from heaven.\n\n&gt; Spence, J. D., *God’s Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan.* 1995\n\nOK, the bit about the suicide wasn't quite the last factual error – Spence's book is copyrighted 1996, not 1995.\n\nFrankly, what disturbs me the most is the fact that this entry, part of a book published in *2016*, has such an unabashedly ~~ pro-Western ~~ no, pro-British spin. Some problems are errors of omission, but these omissions are important – the author says nothing of the influence of foreign missionaries on Hong's theological development, the actual key role played by Zeng Guofan, the other Chinese armies which the EVA was a mere complement to, or the efforts of Ward before Gordon or of the French in Zhejiang. Nothing is said of the paradoxical decision to back the Qing a year after concluding a war against them. Nothing is said of the massacres perpetrated against ordinary Chinese civilians by the Qing. Nothing is said of the many 'kings behind the throne' – no separate entry exists for Hong Rengan, for example – nor the fact that the rebellion was bigger than Hong, and drew on more than just wacky theology. At first this made me laugh, and then it made me angry.\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo be honest, I felt like I needed to say a little more about why this is so thoroughly distressing. Basically, this entry claims to base itself off a source which takes the Chinese viewpoint, yet it has been written with an entirely Western perspective. It is never said that Hong was Christian, absolving the West of any responsibility for the rebellion starting. Nothing is said of the oppressiveness of the Qing regime before the rebellion, the (often worse) atrocities it committed in anti-Taiping reprisals, or its utter failure subsequently on the world scene, making it out to be that the West was justified in backing them instead of the Taiping. Worst of all, it makes Gordon (and by extension the West) out to be this saviour of China when in reality Gordon was not appointed by the Qing but by the British, not as a humanitarian effort but as a political ploy to strengthen its influence in China at the cost of France's.^5 How this could be published by an 'Australian national treasure' in 2016 is simply baffling.\n\nNotes and Sources:\n\n* ^1 Jian Youwen, *The Taiping Revolutionary Movement* (1971), p. 13\n\n* ^2 Jian (1971), p. 118\n\n* ^3 Jonathan Spence, *God's Chinese Son* (1996), p. 171\n\n* ^4 One example can be found in Teng Ssu-Yu, *Historiography of \nthe Taiping Rebellion* (1962), p. 10-11, detailing an episode recorded in the *Tianfu Xiafan Chaoshu*, or 'Proclamations of the Heavenly Father's Will on His Visits to the Earth'.\n\n* ^5 Richard J.

This isn't about the entire post, it's exclusively about a particular historical claim embedded in the thread.\n\n&gt; Then the parties switched when the democrats are on record as having mainly been the ones who owned slaves. Not all democrats owned slaves, but **100% of slaves were owned by democrats. Not a single republican in history owned a slave.** As we know, the parties switched again when republicans repudiated slavery and democrats defended it, leading to the civil war.\n\nNow, I was initially planning on approaching this topic with the obvious pedantic correction: Between March 20th 1854 (founding of the GOP) – December 6th, 1865 (ratification of the 13th amendment)^^1 you had a huge number of third parties and unaligned individuals. This means OP's framing (100-0=100) is a false dichotomy. However, I found something much more interesting. \n\nIn 1861-1862, Lincoln attempted to push the border south towards compensated emancipation. [Lincoln’s July 12, 1862 appeal to the border states (for compensated emancipation)](http://www.freedmen.umd.edu/bordstat.htm) is the usual citation you'll see related to this idea. My example; however, is from a November 1861 meeting where Lincoln tried to convince Delaware, the slave state with by far the smallest amount of slaves, to take steps towards compensated emancipation. \n\n&gt; Local  historian,  Richard  B.  Carter,  in  his  March  2004  article  about  slavery  in  Delaware (published in Shoreline, a journal of the Edward H. Nabb Research Center for Delmarva History &amp;  Culture  of  Salisbury  University) documented that  Benjamin  Burton,  the  largest-known  slave  owner  in  Delaware,  accompanied  Delaware  Congressman  George  Fisher  to  Washington,  D.C.  and  met  with  President  Abraham  Lincoln  to  discuss  a  plan  for  compensated  emancipation. Mr. Carter’s  research  indicated that  in  November  of  1861,  Congressman  Fisher  was  summoned  to  Washington  by  Postmaster  General  Montgomery  Blair.  The  urgent  business  referenced  in  the telegram  involved  a  meeting  with  President  Lincoln  to  review  a  proposed  plan  for  the  federal  government  to  purchase  slaves  from  slave  owners and  emancipate  them.   Congressman  Fisher  agreed  to  discuss  the  plan  with  **fellow  Republican,**  Benjamin  Burton. [source](https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/pdfs/14000551.pdf)\n\n\n\nI can’t find Shoreline or the article online but here are a few corroborating sources: [Slavery and Freedom in Delaware, 1639-1865 by former University of Delaware professor William H. Williams](https://books.google.com/books?id=bVMdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=Benjamin+Burton+slave+owning+republican&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vukvFI92cb&amp;sig=jerb5QQhqbwFQOaNoe1b59IyuQ4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJrr-ulYfaAhWPVN8KHZjfCzAQ6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Benjamin%20Burton%20slave%20owning%20republican&amp;f=false), [the new York Times/Professor Richard Striner]( https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/abraham-lincolns-audacious-plan/) (which notes Fisher is not only a slave owner but “the second largest slave owner”)\n\n\n[And here’s a random history site whose quality I can’t verify](http://slavenorth.com/delaware.htm)\n\n&gt; Fisher arranged a meeting between Lincoln and Republican Benjamin Burton of Indian River Hundred in Sussex County, who, with 28 slaves, was the leading slaveowner in Delaware. Burton listened to the President's plan, and assured him the state's farmers would go along with it if the price was fair. Fisher then went to Dover, and, with the help of Republican Nathaniel P. Smithers, drew up a bill and presented it to the General Assembly. It would free all slaves over 35 at once, and all others by 1872. The compensation rate was to be set by a local board of assessors, and payments were to average about $500 per slave, which was very generous. It was more than a prime field hand was worth, and was five times the value of a typical slave in the state. Payment was to come from a pool of $900,000 to be provided by Congress, then safely in GOP hands. \n\nSo both the largest Slave Owner in Delaware and a Delaware Congressman (per NYT link) are Republicans. I’d love to pivot from this to discuss the existence of slave owning republicans in a broader historical context but (as hinted at above) but it's a topic I only have (at best) a surface level knowledge of. It sounds like a fascinating topic to dive into. \n\n\"Slave owning republicans\" sounds like a fake history meme someone forgot to invent but it is clearly attested to historically.\n\n\n\n**************\n^^1 Yes, I know, the \"real\" date should be either June 14th or July 19th 1866 (final relevant US treaties with the '5 civilized tribes' ending Slavery in Native American lands) but I'm not trying to be *that* pedantic (I need to save some topics to cover later).\n\n*************\n\n\n",

        "text": "Dungeon Crawl Classics is a great roleplaying game available [here](http://goodman-games.com/store/product/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg-softcover-edition/). Part of its \"mission,\" if you will, is to represent a version of roleplaying that it feels is more \"accurate\" or at least more fun - one where the world is smaller, harsher, less informed than a typical roleplaying game, and it doesn't always see the PCs as innate heroes. As such, it dedicates a bit of time to dismissing some common trappings of vaguely \"medieval\" fantasy RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons. One of the biggest quotes on the subject is on page 304, \"Journeys in a Small World:\"\n\n&gt;This manuscript will repeatedly stress the limits of knowledge in a medieval world. You, good sir, who read this manuscript, have access to an extraordinary amount of information. There is the internet and cell phones, there is television and radio, there are printed books, and there are libraries and universities and experts in your world. In a medieval setting, none of this exists. Pens and paper are expensive, there are no printing presses, and it takes a scribe almost a year to manufacture a single book.\n\nMost of this is well and obvious - of course there were no phones and so on. But the book does not tell us what medieval time period it specifically aims to represent, so we must assume the game can take place during any of it. And in that case the claim that there are no \"libraries and universities and experts in your world\" is a bit bunk. The university is largely a medieval *invention*. The existence of the Wikipedia page [\"Medieval university\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_university) is enough to lend some legitimacy here, and there's a nice [archived lecture](http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/universities.html) on the subject here which states:\n\n&gt;\nThe chancellor refused to help the master and students of the Latin Quarter, so they barricaded the streets leading into the Latin Quarter, and the masters held a meeting that night. They decided to organize themselves into a union, or, as it was called in the Latin of the time, a universitas. Since their students were studying in order to become masters themselves, the union included the students as more or less junior members. The next day, representatives of the union went to the king of France and announced themselves as spokesmen for The University of the Masters and Students of Paris.\n\nThis was in 1200, giving a solid 200 years+ of the traditionally considered \"medieval\" period for universities to exist, and somewhere around 600 years that institutions that were predecessors of or resembled universities were around. While a tiny detail in a 400+ page book, the emphasis given to a point like this disappoints me 1) because they act so snobbish about *really* understanding the time period (snobbishness is a fact of the whole book though), and 2) the truth is actually a *cooler* detail! With this information in mind, parties of players could travel in search of famed universities, or hidden ones, or so on. There's even room for a dynamic related to the wizard's search for knowledge in controversial practices. In [University Records and Life in the Middle Ages](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;view=toc;idno=heb06048.0001.001), many of the contained documents are about condemning the practice of witchcraft and alchemy. That link is subscription gated, but you can see just from the titles of some of the records: \"Magic Arts Condemned, Paris, 1398,\" \"Dominican Legislation Against Alchemy, 1323\" and so on. As another user kindly pointed out below, these concerns were often due to magic being, well, bullshit in real life - but some of these sources do indicate a concern about \"evil.\" Getting into a political or even magical spat with some university authorities is IMO a lot more interesting and featuring many more potential adventures and implications than this rulebook's demanded approach of \"go find spells in a cave or something.\"\n\nAnd because this book has an unusual fascination with describing wizards at the same time that they get things wrong, later on, on page 314 \"General Principles of Wizard Spells\" we get:\n\n&gt;This is a medieval, feudal society without bookbinding technology\n\nUse of the word feudal aside, the book seems to conflate the ability to print books and the ability to bind them. That sounded fishy to me, and well, here's an interesting paper: [Cracking the Codex: Exploring Medieval Bookbinding Technology through Experimental Replication](https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2460&amp;context=etd_hon_theses). It depends a bit on your exact definition of binding when it started, but the earliest thing approximating it is described as sewn codexes dating around the 3rd century, and all other examples of more substantial bookbinding methods developed according to the paper fall somewhere within the 11th and 12th centuries. \n\nAnd because this book simply *loves* dunking on itself, it likes to talk a lot about wizard grimoires - which in fantasy tradition are rather elaborately bound in leather. And the page after it makes sure you understand there are no libraries, it mentions a still-existing \"Library of Alexandria\" for players to discover.\n",
