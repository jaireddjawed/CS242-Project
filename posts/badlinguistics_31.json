        "text": "[Keep in mind that Pinker was born and raised in Montreal but cannot even speak French! \nOn the covers of his books seeking to establish his credentials always state that he is an expert ‘about’ language but never indicate ability to function in more than one language, let alone experience the world in another language besides English. Furthermore, in his books he often phrases things in a way that may imply he speaks the language he is referring to. For example, in The Language Instinct, Pinker (1994:66) writes “Anyone familiar with Yiddish knows …” and “Bier could not read Chinese, but if he had been able to read Chinese, he would have discovered …”. Alas, after an exhaustive search I could find no evidence supporting multilingual ability in the case of Pinker. On the contrary, I only found counter evidence in relation to the two languages besides English Pinker was exposed most to in life – French and Yiddish. Pinker stated in an interview on C-SPAN 2 (“In Depth with Steven Pinker”)  that he wishes he had learned to speak French and Yiddish. He regrets that even though he is the son of Yiddish-speaking parents and grew up and lived in French-speaking Montreal until graduating from university, he never learned to speak either language. Essentially, that means that Pinker is one of the 5% of Montreal natives who do not speak French as a first or second language! If he really wanted to become fluent in a foreign language surely it should be easy for him with all his metalinguistic knowledge. He must be held back by his own beliefs about adult language learning and inability to face the psychological and affective factors that hold him back from trying to do so.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-B_ONJIEcE)\n\nThis quote is in the comments section",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago. I am Mexican, and was in Spanish class, which I guess it's like English class on English-speaking parts of the world. There was a brief lecture of how the Spaish was originated, and it wasn't pretty clear because it was mainly emphasizing the Greek and Latin recent loanwords, the reasons behind why are they still relevant. So this crappy lecture finishes, and the teacher starts “explaining”.\n\n“Many years ago at the Aegean Sea, there was a war that created a lot of Hellenistic influence, and that's how Greek was born. So Romans copied Greek, and that's why Latin is derived from Greek”. \n\nMy guess is that there he misunderstood how Greek loanwords are first Latinized, but not that Latin is a language that commes from Greek.\n\nThen he continued: “And when Romans arrived to Spain, they influenced the Castillean there, and that's why there are some Latin words on Spanish... uh, like the ones on the book”. “After that, Spaniards arrived to Mexico and that's why we have Spanish while on Spain they have Castillean”. And he finally said: “2000 years of language evolution and yet we ruin it everyday because of how we talk”.\n\nHe has been the worst teacher I had in my life. I remember having an argument with him because he confused the gerund with the participle, and he said the gerund form of *nacer* is *nacido*, that *naciendo* is wrong and there's no way that is possible.\n\nI recall that, after that, a kid asked what was the oldest language, because some classmates saw him as an authority. He then said: “Well, that is discussed. Bible says about the Tower of Babel, so yeah, that gives us an idea” (note: this was a catholic school, so saying that wouldn't get him fired), “but we must look at the oldest scriptures, I think Summerian it is”.\n\nI really hope he doesn't teaches anymore. He said something about starting a business once, so I really hope he went that way and stopped being such a shitty teacher. I feel bad for those who may still believe his word. ",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/34p96t/without_western_punctuation_chinese_is_nothing/",
        "text": "This is my first submission here, yay!  So please be gentle (..)  and I may have made some mistakes, if so please correct me...\n\nThis is an old bit of bad history, and a bit of bad linguistics, so I'm not quite sure where to post it...  So it's going here! It's in Chinese, so I'm (imperfectly) translating parts of it. And because I'm translating it, I'm going to add some comments and background on what I translate, because I can't resist (I hope that's okay mods &lt;3).  By which I mean I'm really procrastinating on studying for my linear algebra final...  \n\nThis is from [here](http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-worldlook-990157-1.shtml), a post titled something along the lines of \"Without western punctuation, Chinese is nothing!\"\n\nIt goes into a bit of background (both at the beginning and in the middle): Classical Chinese didn't have very much punctuation, and it didn't have Arabic numerals.\n\nWhich are both true!  The punctuation in classical Chinese was both minimal and inconsistent between works, so something like [Analects would look like this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Commentaries_of_the_Analects_of_Confucius.jpg).  This means you have to learn how to punctuate a sentence (断句) as you read it.  Apparently when learning how to read, you would also have to be taught how to punctuate the sentences.  Which, as Classical Chinese diverged from vernacular^1 a very long time ago,  meant you wouldn't be studying the language you spoke from birth, so isn't trivial to figure out the punctuation^2.  They also give a few humorous examples where this could cause confusion.\n\nAnd Arabic numerals were only made there way into China in the Ming or Qing or sometime around then.  So they may show up in some later works, but whatever.\n\nSo now onto the bad linguistics:\n&gt;中国古代没有创造出许多符号，所以几千年来中文都是一种笨拙难用的文字，有极大的局限性。比如现在的物理、化学、数学公式都是用西式符号为载体的，你可以转化成汉字的符号吗？\n\n&gt;另一个方面，中国人没有创造出好用的数字，中国古代一直用一、二、三、四在记账的，非常难用，容易篡改，而大写数字“壹贰叁肆伍”是世界上最难写的数字。现在通用的阿拉伯数字，虽然是印度人发明、阿拉伯人传播的，但仍旧是西方人的发扬光大的。没有这些阿拉伯数字，运算就成了极大的问题。所以现代科学没有诞生在东方是必然的。\n\n&gt;从这几个方面看，现代汉语只是个混合体，是学习西语言的产物。汉语真的没有什么值得骄傲的！\n\ntranslation:\n&gt;Ancient China didn't create many punctuation marks, so for these thousands of years it has been an awkward, hard to use (written) language, that has had significant restrictions.  For example, modern physics, chemistry, and mathematics euqations are all made from western symbols, can you switch it to Chinese?\n\n&gt;Another problem was Chinese never created easy to use numerals.  Ancient China only used 一、二、三、四 (1,2,3,4) in accounting, which are very hard to use, easy to alter, and \"daxie\" numerals^3 “壹贰叁肆伍” (1,2,3,4,5) are pretty much the worlds hardest to write numbers.  Although Indians invented them, and Arabs spread them, it was still westerners who led to Arabic numerals being widely used and popular.  Without these, calculations are a huge problem.  So there was never any chance for modern science to develop in the East.  \n\n&gt;Looking at it from these perspectives, modern Chinese is only just a mixture, a result of copying western languages.  Chinese really isn't something to be proud of!\n\nThere is a little bit of bad language history here, about the numerals.  一、二、三、四 etc. are kind of annoying to use for, say, calculations.  Good thing there was this thing called [rod numerals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counting_rods) (such as [Suzhou numerals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou_numerals)) that were sometimes used in accounting and mathematics and were more convenient for that.  Rod numerals don't seem to be all that awful, and claiming that this lack of Arabic numerals prevented modern science from developing in the east is just a little tiny bit of a stretch. There were a lot of factors to why the current formalisms used both in the West and in China were developed elsewhere...\n\nThe other bad linguistics is a bit more obvious, I think.  Almost all languages borrow from other languages, just because Chinese uses punctuation and numerals from other languages isn't something bad about it, and that's not a reason not to be proud of your language.  And just in case you aren't sure what the op is arguing for, he makes that perfectly clear in the comments:\n\n&gt; 我写此文的用意是，中国现代文化基本是山寨西方，中国文明应该向西方靠拢。 \n\n&gt;  The reason I wrote this piece is to show modern Chinese culture is fundamentally a copy of western culture, and that Chinese civilization should draw closer to the west.\n\nIf your written language has elements of another language in it, it is fundamentally a copy of that culture!  Which is why everything is a copy of the oldest language, Sandskrit! Thus, we should all strive to be closer to and learn from [the sand people](http://www.jeditemplearchives.com/galleries/2012/Review_JumboVintageSandPeople/Review_JumboVintageSandPeople_stillA.jpg)!  \n\n1. If it ever was vernacular. I've heard different people say different things, and I'm not a linguist, so I have no clue who to trust.  maybe it's ambiguous? Who knows?  Not me!\n2. Although there are a lot of characters like 也, 哉, 乎, or what have you that often times (on top of their pronunciation) also seem to denote stops, pauses, breaths, etc. in sentences.  So maybe as my classical chinese gets better it won't be as much of a pain.  I hope?  \n\n3. The normal 一、二、三 etc. are easy to alter. For exaple, to turn one into three (一 into 三) you just need to add two lines, so you often use more complicated but harder to alter characters, called daxie, when writing things that you prefer not to be altered.  It is also sometimes used for artistic purposes, like saying \"book 2 of the _____ series\" on a book title.\n\nAnd a bonus from the comments:\n\n\n\n\nSo how should you reply to this?  A reasoned calm response isn't for everybody.  How about claiming it is hard to put into words the beauty and depth of Chinese characters, then follow it up [with a rant](http://bbs.tianya.cn/post-worldlook-990157-2.shtml) that would give [this one a run for its](http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/34mous/sanskrit_discussion_in_rlinguistics/cqwk5lw) money (and unfortunately appears to be serious)?  After trying to show poems with characters &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; poems with out them (which is definitely why all english poetry is shit), it opens up its main rant with:\n\n&gt;不知道这世界上是否还有第二种语言能像中文这样产生出如此极具美感的文字来\n\n&gt;I'm not sure if the world has another language that can compare to the beauty of Chinese.  \n\nAnd quickly goes down hill from there, after about 2000 characters ending with:\n&gt;汉语之美，令我无法用汉语形容它的美！   \n&gt;Chinese's beauty, I can't even use Chinese to describe it!\n\nWhile this may be a really good parody (seriously that last line is soooooo good), I don't think it is, and neither does the op because he made a serious response to it and whoever wrote the rant didn't correct them.  So yeah.\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/34jv5t/my_tonedeaf_aunt_a_badlinguistics_story/",
        "text": "So, far and away the most popular way to share our badling is by direct links. Unfortunately, not quite everything I do ends up on the Internet which means that if I want to tell you guys this story, I've got to recount it the old fashioned way; prose. Go ahead, get your shudders of revulsion out now and prep for round two as I tell you the story of my Tone-Deaf Aunt.\n\nOver the last summer, my dad finally got me to cave on visiting my grandparents down in good ol' Nawlins (New Orleans, Louisiana, for our unfamiliar and/or non-US members). He achieved this by agreeing to pay for myself and my fiance, both travel and board which, in addition to this obviously being very important to him, was enough to seal the deal for a few days of awkwardness.  I had, up until this point, resisted because I've got basically no relationship with them and they're...not quite there, anymore. They also are only tangentially important to this story, so that's as far as I'll speak on them. \n\nThe entire group was myself, my father, my Fiance, and my sister, splitting two rooms. We spent about four days in the state and on the second day, my Aunt, my father's sister, found out we were in town. Now, we had avoided mentioning the trip to her and only let it slip because we found out that she'd also be visiting the grandparents and they'd mention it, so we figured we'd let it out of the bag first. We didn't really like my Aunt. Still don't. She has some unfortunate habits, such as trying to take over anything she touches and making unusual claims with unfounded authority. By the third day, we had plans to get dinner with her. We joked about what madness she'd probably say, and I mentioned I'd probably be able to sit through it all until she started talking about one of two topics; homosexuality or language. Fortunately (unfortunately?) for this sub, she never talked about homosexuality.\n\nThe meal was mostly what I would have expected. We had fried gator (My first time having it, it was pretty good!) and she insisted it was too salty, and sent it back. She talked about our family history and how our grandfather had fought in the \"War of the Americas.\" We have no idea what war she was referring to. My best guess is the Spanish American war, but my Grandfather isn't that old. Then, finally, inevitably, she started talking about herself.\n\nIn particular, she mentioned that she'd always had such a hard time with reading and spelling. Her grammar is mostly fine, but letters will sometimes swap around or turn into different, similar sounding ones. She knew what the problem was though. See, when she was in college, she met a music major. When my aunt mentioned this problem, the music major said she had a theory. See, each vowel--a,e,i,o,u, and sometimes y--had a distinct tone to it. My Aunt, as it happens, is Tone-Deaf, therefore she isn't able to distinguish between the different vowel tones, affecting her spelling. \n\nThe entire table, minus my Aunt who was still mid-story, looked straight at me. The woman clearly suffered from some kind of language disorder, likely dyslexia, and I wanted to tell her, /r/badlinguistics, I wanted to tell her **so bad** how completely wrong she was and maybe try to give her an idea of where to go to actually get some help for this lifelong problem (Being both kinds of disgraphic and dyslexic myself). But it wouldn't have helped. For the same reason it wouldn't have helped if any of us had mentioned that grandpa wasn't that old or that no one in the states called any US engagement \"the War of the Americas.\" Because another habit my aunt has is that she won't be wrong. If she tells you trees spit out carbon monoxide and arsenic and eat up all of our precious oxygen, it won't matter what actual evidence you show her, she'll just...keep talking like you never said anything. \n\nSo I sat there, Badling. I sat there and smiled and pretended to dick around on my phone and once we were back in the car, everyone else got a short lecture on how the English language doesn't distinguish vowels by tone. Because I had to make sure *someone* knew.\n\nAnd that is the story of my Tone-Deaf Aunt. \n\ntl;dr, my aunt is Tone-Deaf, so she can't spell. ",

        "text": "I’d like to share some of my favorite posts from a user who mostly posts in German language subs. One of his rare posts in English-speaking subs [got featured on this sub yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/33eoe3/trivia_the_latin_femininum_is_actually_a_plural/) and I wanted to take the opportunity to make his oeuvre more popular.\n\nFirst some background: As you probably know, Gender-neutral language has been a controversial topic in Germany for more than 40 years. In German, the masculine form of address is commonly used as a neutral default (“generic masculine”). If a group has an unknown or mixed composition, then the masculine form prevails (der Lehrer - male teacher, die Lehrerin = female teacher, die Lehrer = mixed group of teachers). Feminist linguistics, among others, have proposed gender-related language reforms that aim to make women (and non-binary people) more visible in communication (e.g. LehrerInnen, Lehrer_Innen, Lehrende,…).\n\nAs you can imagine, most German Reddit users do not think highly of feminist critique of language, and every debate on the topic ends in the same smug circlejerk. But there is always this particular user who puts everyone else to shame. /u/Grolser, who [claims to be an Indo-Germanic ~~linguist~~ scholar](http://np.reddit.com/r/German/comments/2h0q9w/addressing_gender_generally/ckojjyp), constantly tries to derail every single discussion by posting longs rants against feminist linguistics.\n\nI’ve translated a few of his best posts. Please feel free to correct my translations/wording!\n\n\n* [All research in this area \\(and generally linguistics\\) is wrong. Nevertheless, our guardians of the law refer to feminist linguists and gender-ideologists, whose theories every freshman who majors in Indo-Germanic philology could easily debunk.](http://np.reddit.com/r/de/comments/2lz6op/223_professuren_f%C3%BCr_eine_pseudowissenschaft/clzvp4w)\n\n* [Once you have studied Old English, Latin, Old Latin, Umbrian, Greek, Mycenaean, Old High German, Middle High German, Old Low German, Middle Low German, and Lithuanian, I'd be happy to discuss specific aspects of Indo-Germanic philology with you.

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/33has0/the_chinese_language_is_a_highly_ambiguous_secret/",
        "text": "So I just got wind of this book called [*The Hundred Year Marathon: China's Secret Strategy to Replace America as the Global Superpower*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Hundred-Year-Marathon-Strategy-Superpower/dp/1627790101) by a foreign policy analyst named Michael Pillsbury. The book is exactly as paranoid and poorly sourced as you would expect (though I don't doubt that his analysis accurately sums up the attitude of the Chinese ultra-right wing specifically). \n\nAs I read the Amazon preview, however, I came across this absolutely astounding series of badlinguistics gems, made all the more astounding and scary by the fact that this person is indeed a high-level State Department advisor who claims to be fluent in Mandarin and is advocating an aggressive foreign policy:\n\n&gt;One of the first things a student of the Chinese language learns is its essential ambiguity. There is no alphabet, and Chinese words aren’t formed by letters. Rather, words are formed by combining smaller words. The word for size combines the character for large with the character for small. The word for length combines the words for short and long. \n\nThe context around this passage clearly makes the implication that Chinese language and culture is uniquely impenetrable to Westerners. He also seems to be implying that \"words...formed by combining smaller words\" is a unique feature of Chinese and not a feature of all languages. English too, forms bigger words by combining smaller morphemes and words together. Indeed, by \"words\" he probably means something more like \"characters\" or \"morphemes\", because the concept of a word itself is not native to Chinese.\n\n&gt;Adding to this complexity are the tones and pitches that delineate words. The effect of tones is to give a single word four possible meanings. A classic example is ma. In the first tone, ma means mother. The second tone is a rising tone, so ma then means numb. The third tone for ma means horse, and the fourth tone for ma, which falls sharply, means to scold.\n\nI suppose none of this is explicitly false, but then he goes and says:\n\n&gt;The Chinese must talk loudly to make the tonal differences audible. \n\nYep you heard him; apparently Chinese people are incapable of whispering. But wait, there's more!\n\n&gt;**The language’s very complexity is like a secret code.** [emphasis added] A foreigner has to make important decisions about how to translate Chinese concepts, which can inherently lead to misunderstandings. I had to decide how to translate unusual, elliptical Chinese phrases that were used by Deng Xiaoping in 1983 to a Senate delegation in Beijing, then ambiguous comments in 1987 by Zhu Rongji in Washington, then again in 2002 to decipher what Hu Jintao meant to convey during his visit to the Pentagon. My colleagues often share our translation decisions with each other. Unfortunately, the vast majority of so-called China experts in the United States do not speak Chinese beyond a few words--enough to feign competence in the presence of those who do not speak the language fluently. This fact makes it easier for the supposed China “experts” to interpret Chinese messages subjectively in ways that conform to their own beliefs. What we all must do better is to look not just at speeches but also at the context of those speeches, and we need to look for larger hidden meanings. For well over a half century, Americans have failed to do this. Until recently, the sometimes vaguely phrased expressions of the Chinese hawks were obscure references to ancient history, so their input to Chinese strategy was hidden from most foreigners.\n\nSo the Chinese language is inherently a \"secret code\" through which the inscrutable, duplicitous Orientals secretly plot to deceive their enemies. Also, established translation conventions regarding how to translate difficult Chinese concepts somehow don't exist, and experts in East Asia studies are somehow inexplicably able to feign enough understanding of Chinese to dupe the US government despite knowing \"only a few words\". Bonus points for advocating a paranoid \"search for hidden meanings\" despite the lack of evidence that there even are any that wouldn't be readily detectable by anyone in the know.\n\nThis paranoia is made even more absurd when [actual East Asia experts](http://chinafocus.us/2015/04/02/a-secret-plot-by-an-ancient-civilization-to-take-over-the-world-book-review-of-michael-pillsbury/) point out that Pillsbury, later in the book, makes the ridiculous claim that *wu wei* means \"to get others to do your work for you\":\n\n&gt;The problems only compound. Pillsbury writes that “A significant component or feature of shi is called wu wei, which means to get other nations to do your work for you.” (Pg. 42) He returns to wu wei nearly 40 pages later when he writes “This is an example of the Warring States concept known as wu wei — or, having others do your work.” (Pg. 69-70) Again on page 77 he tells us that wu wei is a “Warring States-era notion.” Later, on page 164, we’re told that wu wei is in fact an “ancient Taoist principle” which he defines as “achieving a great deal by drawing on the strength of others.” (Pg. 164-165).\n\nI'll just say that if this is the caliber of intellect running US foreign policy, our country is surely going to the dogs.",
