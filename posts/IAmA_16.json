        "text": " Hello all! I'm Yongli Chen, the creator of Shifu Framework, the next-generation Kubernetes-native open source IoT development framework. I used to work at Microsoft AKS - Azure Kubernetes Service for a few years. Before that, I worked at Azure Container Networking and was in charge of Azure CNI - Container Networking Interface.   \nWhen Microsoft pivoted its strategy from \"mobile first, cloud first\" to \"intelligent cloud and intelligent edge\", I started to wonder why and did my research on intelligent edge. Intelligent edge is essentially edge computing. Coincidentally, working at AKS and Kubernetes has become the de facto standard in cloud computing. I started to wonder if we can leverage the power of Kubernetes in edge computing as well. The blocker for edge computing is that it's time-consuming and challenging to develop IoT apps. That's where Shifu comes in...  \nShifu framework makes developing an IoT app as simple as developing a Web app. The high extensibility of Shifu allows it to integrate almost all devices and protocols. Once a device is integrated, Shifu generates a digital twin of the device as a microservice in the system and opens up device data and capabilities in the form of APIs. In this way, traditional IoT application development is simplified to web development, which greatly improves the efficiency, quality and reusability of IoT application development.  \nYou can learn more about Shifu Framework here: [github](https://github.com/edgenesis/shifu), and join [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XDHFtA5ZhP) if you have any further questions.  \nAsk me anything about IoT, Kubernetes, Edge Computing, Open Source, and startups. :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProof:  [Imgur: The magic of the Internet](https://imgur.com/a/UMC0ZwB) , [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YongliChen/status/1597956216017530880)",

As you may have gathered from the title, I am Max Florschutz, author of Science-Fiction and Fantasy novels, here to celebrate tomorrow's launch of the ninth book to bear my name and the conclusion to an epic Sci-Fi trilogy: *Starforge*! I'll be answering questions until about 5 PM MST!\n\nThat's the short of it. The long of it? Well, I'm still an author of Science-Fiction and Fantasy, so that doesn't change. But I'll give you a bit more backstory. My first book, *One Drink*, was published in 2013, making next year the ten-year anniversary of my career as an author. It was followed a short time later by a sequel, *Dead Silver*, and from there by numerous other books, including *Colony*, the first book in the UNSEC Space Trilogy that will reach its titanic conclusion when *Starforge* releases tomorrow!\n\nI'm also known for running *Being a Better Writer*, a weekly writing guide answering all sorts of common questions about writing (and if you ask a common writing how-to question, I may just drop you a link) each Monday on my website. You can also [check out that site](https://maxonwriting.com/) (*Unusual Things*) for writing samples, free stuff, and preview chapters of each of my books.\n\n**My Proof:** [Obligatory website link!](https://maxonwriting.com/2022/11/28/reddit-ama-today-starforge-launches-tomorrow/)\n\nFull list of books so far, in publication order:\n\n- *One Drink*\n\n- *Dead Silver*\n\n- *Unusual Events: A \"Short\" Story Collection*\n\n- *Colony* (UNSEC Space 1)\n\n- *Shadow of an Empire*\n\n- *Jungle* (UNSEC Space 2)\n\n- *A Dragon and Her Girl* (Anthology collection - Featured Author)\n\n- *Axtara - Banking and Finance*\n\n- *Starforge* (UNSEC Space 3)\n\nAgain, I'll be answering questions until about 5 PM.

We were learning about the von Neumann architecture, the standard design for almost all computers today. But his name’s come up repeatedly since then—even more so recently and in [wildly](https://theglobalfrontier.com/putins-nuclear-threat-according-to-game-theory/) [different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H55wybU3rI) [contexts](https://nautil.us/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-uncertainty-245816/).\nI knew right from the get-go I didn’t want to write a [standard biography](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/john-von-neumann-the-scientific-genius-who-pioneered-the-modern-computer-game-theory-\nnuclear).

        "text": "hey guys! long story short, I always had an issue of too much fluid before/during/after intercourse ( got it checked up and no STDs or other diseases or issues). (warning here for next part) during climax it usually looks like a quarter jug of milk went everywhere, (TMI warning: usually its like around 10 sperts/\"ropes\" and heavier than average or from what ive seen...sorry if thats tmi but I just really want the guys (or girls or however you identify as) here to get an idea/reference and know what I mean/believe me ). I thought it was maybe linked to a larger than average \"member down there\" so it might be fine, but upon research found out it wasnt. I Went to the doctor finally and found out I had hyperspermia. Doctor said  I should get checked for my sperm count and fertility/sterility since its commong for men with hyperspermia to actually have LOW sperm count, making them not fertile. I got scared, So I set up the appointment really soon after, and got the results not long after as well....oddly, when the results came in, it stated I had actually a oddly higher than average sperm count and they were even a little extra motile. I asked the doctor personally about this and he kind of laughed and said he hasnt met or seen anybody with both of these issues as its uncommon , but it isnt impossible. So anyone that was afraid like me before any knowledge of this or DOES NOT KNOW OF THIS ISSUE like I did should get checked out like I was told to. Hopefully i was able to spread knowledge through my story and educate anyone else that did not know this was a condition/potential issue with some possible problems.
