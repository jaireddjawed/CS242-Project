        "text": "I have a friend who I have known since we were in primary school, and continued to be close with throughout secondary school. I stayed in the same city for university, and she moved down south. For the first couple of years of university, we managed to see each other at least once per long holiday, so about twice a year, and continued to keep on touch on Instagram messenger. I saw her last summer and it went well. We are definitely more different to each other than we used to be, and she seems to have embraced student life more than I have, but we still had as much to talk about as ever. We also met up with another friend from school who I talk to every once in a while.\n\nSince then, I have continued to try and get in touch with her, communicating in basically the same way: sending her things I think she might find interesting and memes that she might find funny. After a couple of messages, I noticed that she did not seem to be replying to the messages or even reading them. She hasn't answered any of my messages since about August. I sent her a couple of things a month until November when I decided that it probably wasn't worth it. She has continued to post regularly on Instagram, so she's clearly still active.\n\nI did a quick Google search, but it seems to refer to not getting a reply after hours or days, so not helpful to me here.\n\nTLDR: my friend has stopped answering my messages on Instagram but is still active. Is this weird, and what do I do?",

I broke out of my social recluse shell, made some friends and opened myself up to experiences that I never had. I would hate to go back to my small bubble again but I’m slightly paranoid about the people around me. I feel like I could break down and be scared of people again if someone was cruel enough to push me over the edge. How do I bounce back from this traum",

        "text": "My wife wanted me to post this because she's \"too exhausted\" to explain to me why I'm in the wrong. \n\nHere goes:\n\nI have a coworker, \"Christine,\" who began working with us at the beginning of the year (August). She's kinda weird but she is in the art department so that's a given. Anyway, she refused to do Christmas decorations with most other faculty, but fine, we're a state school and not like a private Christian one or whatever. Fair enough. I admit I was salty because if the art teacher doesn't participate in the Christmas door contest, then who would She could of won us the building door prize. But whatever.\n\nLow and behold, she shows up after MLK break with Chinese new year decorations all over her door. Several of us kinda laughed at this privately and in a private group text. Like weird flex to be \"inclusive, but okay.  I mean, we're in the south and in a place where there's minorities because of the army base, but not really any Asians. Also I happen to know she's from a rural area in our state and I don't think there were/are any Asians there (think a county of about 20,000 as I just googled). \n\nI got wind that she was telling her students she's part Chinese. I asked her about it during a faculty meeting and she said yes, she's part Chinese. I told her she doesn't look ANYTHING like a Chinese person should. Her nose is like a roman nose with a bump on it. Her eyebrows are too high and arched. I told her she needs to do a 23 and Me or something cause her mama told her wrong. She got up and moved to a different table. then another colleague at our table, Rhonda, who, admittedly is kinda of busy body, said she warned Christine to ask admin before putting up the decorations in case there was a problem. Well, Christine evidently got bitchy with Rhonda and said, If anybody has a problem with it, I'll be glad to go to HR so they can lose their job and start cleaning toilets at McDonalds. I told my wife and she said, \"Good for Christine! Y'all suck as coworkers.\"\n\nHere's where I may be the a\\*\\*hole: Friday I saw Christine at bus duty. We were in a little group and ribbing each other about weekend plans and busting each other's balls. Christine said she was going out for Mexican that night with her friend. I said, Your friend's name is Korean. She said yes, she's Korean. I said, Oh, so are you pretending to be Chinese to fit in? Are y'all gonna eat Mexican with chopsticks? So everyone excused themselves and headed to their cars cause it's friday and we all bust out and don't wait around on Fridays after the busses. \n\nChristine reacted badly because she didn't say goodbye to us but rudely walked to her car.\n\nMy wife is \"horrified\" and feels like I need \"sensitivity\" training. I do not think so. My wife and I have gone around about this many times in our marriage about shit I say. I get it, but I'm never around minorities except some coworkers and many of the kids at work. I think we're all the same and I'm tired of people making a difference in us. Also, even if Christine IS part Chinese, she don't look it. Like pretty much at all. Can you be Chinese and not look it? \n\nY'all help a boy out and let me know where to go from here. Now I'm pissing myself because my wife thinks christine will go to HR about me. I've been doing this job for a while and don't want to lose my retirement.",

I know I give that \"don't talk to me\" aura. \n\nAlso, another problem I have is that, everyone in our class seem to be watching who each person is talking to, which makes me feel very conscious and I end up not talking to people. (I'm not socially anxious or anything, I've met people who do this and have heard stories).\n\nI'm at a loss for what to do. I just don't feel happy anymore and any sort of human interaction irritates me. \n\nThis may sound really weird, but I always ask people what the gossip about me is, and the consensus seems to be that I'm weird because I don't talk. So people seem to take time to open up to me when I talk to them. \n\nLooking forward to receiving any sort of advice. Each time I try, I feel like I'm hitting roadblocks each time.\n\nThanks!

My SO has called me out on this, and I've been trying to stop saying it so often. But it's like a knee-jerk reaction. \n\nI also over-thank when people do nice things for me (offer to give me a lift somewhere, give me a gift, etc.). In this situation, I feel like I haven't done anything worthy to deserve their kindness, and want to make sure they know I'm appreciative. I often feel like I'm imposing on a situation or a burden and even though I know I'm not. \n\nI think this all stems from my upbringing, and these feelings make it difficult to just relax and be at ease when hanging out with potential friends.",

        "text": "I recently started noting down my social challenges and zeroed in on top 2:\n1) Question: What methods or systems do you use to remind yourself to speak in a particular way? \nContext: I have always felt that I do better when I speak slow because I organise my thoughts better. Also my words are jumbled up when I speak at my usual pace, so being slow helps at articulation. But since I have been speaking fast and loud since childhood, I tend to forget to speak slow and not loud. \n\n2) Question: What topics to stick to in social situations and avoid personal / extreme topics? \nContext: Also I tend to go to slightly extreme topics ( like What do I feel about my manager or Talk about my country vs other countries Or my views about a certain person) which are considered slightly difficult to respond to or build communication on.  Again, I do it automatically because it helps me \"know the real person\" but at the same time alienates new people.",

One of my friend who is sexually gay told me I give off “stud” energy when I’m a Muslim women that always dresses in dress 0-0. In the past two years no man has approached me or have had a small crush on me, it’s no big deal but I always wonder. So my question is that why do I attract women??",

One of them is a female player who I've known for some years too, but recently after some gaming sessions we moved to other games and played them with each other, although always by my initiative, but never using any voice chat or something like that. The problem here is that for some reason I feel like recently I've been playing that game more specifically to play and chat with her, when that's clearly unhealthy because 1st she might just be a random 40 year old guy; 2nd she's not a \"real\" person in the sense that I'll never see her or talk to her ever in my life and 3rd I'm aware that she doesn't slightly care about me and uses me just to pass time and not be bored. This is leaving me very worried and conflicted since I'm clearly developing something like an online crush on her and I'm beginning to simp for her in a certain way so I'm considering just blocking her on discord (we basically never chat there, it's just me initiating conversations about game-related things and other random stuff) and try to avoid her in-game for the sake of my mental health. How should I approach this situation and what should I do?",

I did a face reveal and then gave him my private insta account months later, which I now regret. anyways, I don't see him that active online anymore on discord. He is somewhat active on insta since he views my ig stories. Whenever we would chat, he would be like \"how are you?\" then I would reply how i'm doing and what i'm up to in my life. He would reply back super dry with a few words and never ask questions or act interested, only sometimes he would give me advice or encouragement. Whenever I asked him the same question back, he is always super dry. Pretty much whenever we chat it's like \"how are you doing?\" and nothing else. Also, he takes forever to reply back, like when I see him online on discord, he would be online but wouldn't reply back to me then go offline, then later a few days reply back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what is up with him and if I should communicate this to him. Like I don't know if he is just busy or is not interested. Like sometimes I'm busy and take a while to reply and he would ask if I'm there, so idk if that means he cares about me and is busy. Or I don't know if I should just remove him since he is always offline and when he is online he would take days to reply back. Also, I don't feel a connection. What do you guys think I should do?",

I said to A, “What if B is jealous that I’m friends with C?” Me and C are also particularly close friends, but I make sure to respect B and C’s relationship by making room for them and establishing a healthy boundary. \n\nSoon, A told B that I was “talking trash” about her.

I said I don’t carry cash and went right back to eating. Then the person asked if I could buy some milk for them at the store and also get some cash back for them. This is what I was able to parse out from their mumbling. I felt bad so I agreed to get them something and also give them a little cash.\n\nIn my head I was thinking of giving them $15-$20 along with the milk, but when I was at the self checkout register they told me that they need $40 + $40 so she and her daughter could get a room to stay at for the night. I did give her that, but afterwards I felt bad bc I didn’t hear that from the start so internally I didn’t agree to that. What should I do in the future to avoid this situation?",

        "text": "[F] 25. So I have never been in a club before mainly because I am friendless, introverted and have social anxiety. My cousin got to know about that and demanded that we go together. Even if it's way better than to go alone I am still way too anxious about it: I don't know if I'll dress right, dance not weird, I'm scared of interactions. I feel like I need a guide to everything for me not to feel awkward if I don't meet standarts and act like other people do. If anyone can be kind enough to answer these questions:\nHow to dress. It's going to be a winter time and I'm not sure if girls wear dresses at 0°C. Cousin suggested to wear short dress to get a full experience but I don't think I'll feel comfortable if I'll see that others have wormer and more practical attire.\nHow to dance. I'm really stiff and hard to relax. I don't ever dance so I'm pretty sure I'll feel awkward on a dance floor. If you have any club dances video that look natural and not too hard please leave a link. I would appreciate it.\nHow to interact with people. I'm bad at small talks or talking in general. Currently unemployed, don't have hobbies so I have no idea what to talk about with me. Sure I could listen more and ask questions,but I struggle with coming up with them. I'm kind of a cardboard cutout, just too dull. And sure you can sense my low self esteem.\nIf anyoune can help me with that any tips would be appreciated. Thank you",

        "text": "We were on a class trip together a while and we could roam around the city we visited freely, but there was one rule: we had to be in groups. \nI asked a friendgroup that my closest friend - let's call him Michael - is a part of (he wasn't on the trip) if I can join them. They agreed. \nThere my classmate (let's call him Ivan) asked us if he could join our group. \n\nHe is quiet, but is nice and isn't annoying, weird or especially creepy. He used to talk with me, Michael and his friendgroup sometimes when he had no one else to talk to. He's not our friend, but we don't mind it and don't have nothing against him. I know he has 2 friends (one from our class and one from his old school) and a boyfriend (from our year but not class). \nHe once told my friend that he has some psychological problems, but he said that \"ehh, it doesn't matter\" when she asked him what is it. Looking at context of when he said that he has psychological problems he could have just joked that time, but I think that he doesn't want to talk about his issues because mental health is still a taboo where we live. \n\nWe agreed. \n\nThen our another classmate followed him (and us). Let's call him Charles. He's weird, annoying and creepy. He's also an incel and can't take care of himself properly. We hate him and Ivan ABSOLUTELY DESPISES him. He's pretty open about that with everyone except Charles. I have a theory that's because he doesn't have a high position in our class and having a common enemy brings him and our class together. \nI think that Charles and Ivan would still be friends (they once were for a short period of time) if we didn't hate Charles. This would probably help Charles not being weird too. \nWhy do I think that? I hate Charles for exactly that reason. I was friends with Charles once too. I can imagine how much he suffers. I was like him once. But I can't help him unless I want to get rejected by the whole class. \nI can tell more about Charles and my backstory if you want to in the comments.\n\nWe got into a cafe and sat down together. Charles ofc joined us. We didn't even try to hide that Charles isn't welcome with us. Charles started to argue with us and that caused Ivan asking him to calm down and that they can choose a different table and don't spend time with us. Charles didn't listen. We escaped the cafe but Charles followed us with Ivan chasing him and telling him to explore the city with him. He didn't listen again. I decided to shot my shoot to be perceived better and literally asked Charles to fuck off. That caused someone from that friendgroup telling him that they don't want no one except them to hang out with them. Someone also told him that he's annoying.\n\nSince then Ivan is very silent. He doesn't talk with me, Michael or his friendgroup even when he his friend or boyfriend is absent. He seems sad since then. Did we hurt Ivan?",

I've become a lot better after a couple of years on stimulants (got diagnosed/started as an adult).\n\nI have high but not unreasonable expectations when it comes to conversations with close friends, esp when we're discussing \"serious things\" (be it some pop issue or personal relationships and who's wrong and who's right or whatever). My expectations are that you slowly and patiently make your point, let the other person finish, think about what they said, respond calmly, and if you really need to interrupt you say sorry, add the relevant point that couldn't wait, and help them get the conversation back on track. Basically I've read and love \"How to win friends...\" and I apply it to the extent possible.\n\nI've \"internally\" made peace with the fact that people tend to not change their minds that easily, and I think how I converse reflects that. But I lose my shit if they speak over me (mentally I'm like \"not only are you wrong, but you're also rude and won't even let me make a relevant point\").\n\nWith such people, I feel like I have to go through a period of conflict where we negotiate these expectations, which is unpleasant in the best case and only worse than that in the average case. On the other extreme, I've found that some of my friends are polite to a fault - they'll let themselves be spoken over rather than hold their ground. Ideally, I think I want to be able to push back on tendencies I consider \"impolite\" without coming across as obnoxious??",

Kiki is usually always supportive but Tara somehow finds something wrong with them, like they did this or they did this, and would get mad at me if I ever talked about them. She’s literally hit me before because I talked about a crush I had that essentially played me. She’s just “joking” but sometimes I don’t know. If she approves of him she’d say “I actually approve of this” and once essentially forced her way into getting a guys number for me (which I didn’t want to do) and whispered yelled “is that him? I’ll get his number for you” to the point where I know he heard despite me not wanting to and verbalizing that. \n\nRight now I’m talking to a guy she doesn’t approve of because he slept with one of her friends and took her stuffed animal or something. We aren’t romantically involved or anything, we just text here and there and he flirts occasionally and I’ve become slightly interested. She doesn’t like him at all and mentioned that he doesn’t talk to her anymore. He was also getting yelled out by a girl for an unknown reason, which is another reason she doesn’t like him. She tried to talk me out of texting him (which I don’t really text first, it’s mostly him) or hanging out with him in our dorms (I haven’t yet but he’s asked). I told her I wanted to meet with him and see if he’s a good person, and she for upset with me and told me I don’t listen, and I felt extremely bad. \n\nInterestingly, she’s justified a guy purposely playing with my feelings by saying “it’s college” and supported a relationship with our friend Kiki knowing his gf slept around (which she’s ADMITTED TO) and was always super nice to the gf. Now I’m the bad guy and can’t hang out with a guy? If anyone said anything about her bf she would lose it which she has. Part of me doesn’t want to hang out with him anyway because of the stuff Tara is saying and my own anxiety + I have a reallllllly hard time saying no (I was in therapy for my anxiety and obsessive thoughts) and Tara is just making my anxiety worse. I’m tired of feeling like I’m being judged. I’m fucking grown. \n\nAdvice please?\n\nTl;dr: my roommate / friend is constantly judging me for my romantic interests",

But I want to talk about personal things so I can get close with them. When I see others who can talk very openly in front of others, I wonder why I can't do that? Is something wrong with me?",

        "text": "And I do not mean it as a bad thing.\n\nFor context, I am very underskilled socially, I try to be myself but at the same time try to contain my expresitivity because some people have told me that I look weird when I express myself, also I'm not really socially smart so most of times I have difficulty \"breaking the ice\" or doing anything that would prevent from earning the title of \"Too quiet\", despite all that, I desire to be able to be more social, I envy people that effortlessly have conversations and make them enjoyable with the participants, I'm an introvert that wants to be social.\n\nBut in this occasion, this person is very extroverted, and have done so much in her life she simply could not stop telling or showing me stuff this person has done or telling me anecdotes.\n\nI do not find this person annoying at all (Maybe this person invades personal space a little bit too much but that's another deal), and I do find pleasing to be the subject of interactions born from desire to speak with me and not from forced interactions or ones done out of obligation or pity, negative interactions I'm quite used to.\n\nWe are attending a course and last two times we assisted, we did not have the chance to properly meet until today. Said that, this person has not had the chance to meet my boring side but I'm not sure if this person will give me the chance because this person talks about themselves way too much, I cannot even properly ask about something they told me because they are already moving to another anecdote or situation.\n\nI would rather show the proper courtesy, specially because today we walked to a bus stop and we ended up finding out that we both have the exact same route towards our homes (In fact, thanks to this person, now my bus trips will be easier as I will require less switching between buses to arrive at my destination), so we pretty much will be riding the bus together to our homes and most likely from our homes to the course too, so if I'm doing something wrong, I will end up being a dreadful accompanying person to which this person will feel forced to engage with to not make it look weird or awkward, and I don't want a person forcing themselves for my sake. That is not what sociability means.\n\nAnyway, that is my only concern. I'm not even expecting a friendship, if it happens, it happens, but if not, at least I want to feel relieved I was not a burden.\n\nJust in case, I do listen and pay attention, but most of times there is too much in I'm not even able to make comments or remarks from the information I was handed.\nI also keep eye contact while the person speaks with occasional \"lookaways\" to give rest and also to not make it uncomfortable.\n\nThank you very much in advance.",

        "text": "To start, let me just say -- I think my conversation skills are on par. I'm incredibly observant, I create space for people to talk, and I'm mindful not to talk over others. I ask engaging questions that prove that I'm actually listening. Most importantly, I'm pretty good at sensing when it's time for a natural pause/break, and not just plugging in mindless chatter. Hell, I even know when to walk *away* from a conversation. If there's *one thing* that most of the people in my life could agree on, it's that I know how to talk to people and that I have a unique way of handling conversation. \n\nDespite this, I just don't know *how* to actually meet anybody, or really, to even initiate a conversation. \n\nWhen I go places in public - such as a store, picking up food at a restaurant, etc., I don't have it in me to initiate any kind of small-talk. I'm just trying to do my thing &amp; leave. When I'm at places where there's more natural opportunity to start a conversation - such as a bar, gym, cafe, etc. - I *still* just... don't really know what to do. Nobody really approaches me, and I'm not sure if I just look/appear unapproachable or disinterested (it's entirely possible that I do). \n\nSo that leaves the onus on socializing to me. Which I'm *fine* with; except that I have no idea what to really do anymore. There are times that I want to talk to someone, but I just don't do it. And there are a variety of excuses for why I don't -- I feel like I'd just be bothering them, that it'd be a waste of time (for either me or them), or that I don't actually *have* anything important to say. \n\nI'll wrap this up and add a bit more context -- I am far more outgoing when I'm with people that I know, or people that I'm comfortable around. There are friends of mine who I have great chemistry with, and we attract attention wherever we go. When I was younger (I'm 29 now), I had **no** problem just meeting people &amp; talking to anybody. I created my own energy. \n\nWhy do I have so much trouble *initiating* a conversation, when I don't seem to have a problem with any other part of the process?",

I've tried to work on this but I'm autistic and I don't know if I'll ever be able to tell if someone's lying. \n\nI haven't had many friends in my life. \n\nMy best friend of 7 years ended up being a pathological liar who was only using me to smoke my weed and hangout in my nice apartment. She ended up stealing thousands worth of things from me  after she moved in. About a year after moving in she stopped paying rent, then completely trashed her room left and blocked me on everything. Cost me about 600 to get the room back into good shape.\n\nI posted on Twitter ( I only have about 50 followers most of which are mutual acquaintances) about how much she hurt me and lied to me. \n\nShe then went on to post a video on Instagram about how much of a horrible person I am, that I'm unemployed and broke, rely on my mom and have no friends, to her 1k followers. All of which go to the bars I used to frequent but now I'm too embarrassed to. Right before she moved out we also went to my favorite bar and puked all over the ground. \n\nShe's the one who is unemployed, and I have a very successful career in healthcare administration. The thing that really hurt is my mom struggled a lot with mental illness and I had moved out at 17 and moved her in now because she was living with my grandma in a bad situation, while I was paying most of the rent for the apartment. My friend knew this and still posted that. This hurt the most as she saw me go to college full time and working full time so I could eventually get a good job to provide for my mom. And this is how she treated me after I achieved it.\n\n\nI know this is a lot but people who have had their trust deeply violated, how do you recover? \n\n\nIts almost been a year and I've only made 1 friend. He's the only person I hang out with about once a month. We're also kind of a thing and he says he wants to be friends and lovers but I've had people say that before just to use me. My body makes it easy to find lovers but I don't want to be with someone just because they want me to fuck them. \n\nI haven't felt this alone since I was being abused in highschool.\n\nI know I need therapy but whenever I try to go I just get horrible panic attacks. And by go I mean just login online to virtual therapy. I was given Xanax but I hate the way it makes me feel. \n\nI feel like I'm going to be alone forever. \n\nI've been trying to get a psychiatrist for about a month now but I keep having to jump through hoops to get one assigned to me. I am actually self diagnosed with autism, I'm certain I'm autistic but I don't know what other issues I face because I don't have anyone to talk to about what having a normal brain feels like. \n\nThis became a huge rant. Sorry to whoever reads this. \n\n\nTldr: how do u learn to trust people and when to trust them?",
