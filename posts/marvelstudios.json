But I didn't know that in 2015.","author":"Stunning_Match1734","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11pj3ah\/the_infinity_saga_works_because_it_is_a_3act\/","text":"If you're a film fan and you've never heard of [Syd Field's *Screenplay*](https:\/\/sydfield.com\/guest-blog\/utilizing-syd-fields-screenwriting-paradigm-to-understand-script-timeline-structureby-natalia-lazarus\/), you might find it worth taking a second to read up on it. It's basically the ur-example of the \"how to write a movie script\" genre. In it, Field delineates a basic 3-act structure that works for pretty much every genre of film. Many of the most popular Hollywood films you've likely seen follow this paradigm.\n\nIf we take a large-scale view of the Infinity Saga, its overall arc follows this paradigm quite closely. I won't write a whole essay here, but I'll hit the major story beats using Tony and Steve as the \"main\" characters of the story:\n\n* Phase 1 was Act I: About 1\/4 of the story (6\/23 films). Introduces the characters and setting. If this were a romance story, it would be the part where it shows her as an upwardly mobile career woman who is successful but unfulfilled, in contrast to him who is a lackadaisical underachiever with mommy issues. In the MCU, we have Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.\n* Plot Point 1\/The Inciting Incident: 2012's *The Avengers*. The heroes meet, initially conflict (thus setting up the later main conflict), but ultimately come together. In the romance movie, this is the little meet-cute where one spills coffee on the other, then their eyes meet, etc. In the MCU, Tony and Steve initially clash aboard the Helicarrier, but later do the little bouncing the laser off the shield to kill aliens thing.\n* Phase 2 is the first half of Act II: Also about 1\/4 of the story's overall length (6\/23 films). This is the \"promise of the premise\", otherwise sometimes known as \"fun and games\". This is the part in the romance where the couple just got together and everything is love and rose-colored glasses. This is that awesome splash page shot at the beginning of AoU. Marvel promised they'd show us heroes teaming up, and this is them delivering on the promise of that premise. Over the course of Phase 2\/Act II Part 1, things seem good. The team is together, but the seeds of conflict are being sown across both IM3 and CA:TWS.\n* The Midpoint (or Mid-way Turning Point): *Age of Ultron*. In the romance movie this is where the nascent couple's jobs or families or personalities get in the way. In the Infinity Saga, it's where Tony and Steve begin to come into conflict over their principles and the consequences of their actions in Phase 2.\n* The first half of Phase 3 (through 2018's *Black Panther*) is the second half of Act II. The team\/couple has fallen apart. Steve and Tony are at odds, Thor and Bruce are off in space, and the others are either outlaws or convicts. The heroes literally fight each other in *Civil War* and *Ragnarok*. And like in many romance movies, the characters' feelings toward each other in CA:CW are not really about each other; Steve is torn between his new life in the present and his only friend from the past, while Tony's angst is really toward Howard, but he aims it at Steve because Steve was Howard's friend. Meanwhile, characters like Dr. Strange and Black Panther are introduced, who serve to show the OG Avengers how they need to be better (just examine T'Challa's role in Civil War to understand this). Even though Act 2.1 was the fun part, Act 2.2 is the real meat of the story, where the conflict becomes real.\n* Plot Point 2 is infinity War. Thanos wins. Every mistake the Avengers have made has lead to this point.\n* Phase 3 Part 2 is Act III: The Avengers realize that it is because they did not work together that Thanos won (think of Tony's collapse scene in early Endgame). They come back together and save the day. Tony gets to make up with Howard and Steve gets to see Peggy again. Having learned from each other, both make peace with their destinies and move forward. A satisfying conclusion.\n\nAnd I think this is why the Infinity Saga is looked back on so fondly by fans: because it tells a complete story that delivers on its promise. Of course this is not the only way to analyze the story, but it's one way that makes sense within standard screenwriting practice.\n\nBut I didn't know this back in 2015, and I don't think any regular fan did. Back then we were all walking out of the theater like \"What was the point of that? How tf was that supposed to be an **age** of Ultron?\" We didn't understand then the purpose of the film or where the larger story was going.\n\nSo just because we don't necessarily see how the films of Phase 4 fit together does not mean they don't have a greater purpose or design. Of course, that does not excuse individual films from not being able to tell a good standalone story within 2.5 hours, but it does mean that as fans of long-form storytelling, perhaps we should be willing to reserve judgment until the current saga is complete. It could end up being just as good or even better than the Infinity Saga, but it will take time.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678639418.0},{"title":"Phase I and II didn\u2019t connect the way people remember them connecting.","author":"Zdvj","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11ozie1\/phase_i_and_ii_didnt_connect_the_way_people\/","text":"Iron Man (1\/2), Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America all had vastly different tones and could have easily fit in different universes, aside from their post credit scenes. People complained Iron Man 2 was too much set up, and it wasn\u2019t until Avengers that these films connected. Additionally, in phase II I would argue that it was only The Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron that expanded on any connected story beats. People shat on The Dark World and outside of the aether infinity stone it didn\u2019t fit within the grand story until Endgame. \n\nI say all this, because with Phase IV it seems like people are really upset these movies didn\u2019t connect the way Phase III did, but Phase III was the culmination of all that stood before it. Phase IV is essentially doing the work that the first two phases did. \n\nThank you for attending my Ted Talk.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678579430.0},{"title":"Designing the Avengers as a low-budget animated comedy.

It got me thinking about good quotes from some marvel projects that everyone agrees are pretty good like NWH, Shang Chi, wakanda forever, loki, and moon knight, but i couldn't really find any. Then I realized something. I realized that the best moments from these projects were visual based. Like in shang chi when his dad died, or in NWH when peter sees mj with a bandaid and decided to leave her alone, or in Wakanda forever when shuri allows herself to grieve over her family's death, or in loki when he sees what happens to him in the future. All these scenes and more had little to no dialogue yet conveyed so much emotion and weight than any quotes or monlogues could have provided. Then i thought back to previous phases and i couldn't really remember any visual moments like these except maybe at the end of infinity war(when thanos sits down) and the finger from doctor strange in endgame, but this may be becacause i havent seen any phase 1-3 movies in a minute.

What makes this concerning is that at the same time, they're also introducing audiences to a new version of the Fantastic Four and could end up cramming multiple movies worth of story into one.

Honestly it makes me kind of and a lot more worried now that their bringing him back into it. \n\nFor one, the Netflix series completely ruined Billy Russo aka Jigsaw in my opinion. In the comics Jigsaw is to The Punisher as Joker is to Batman, and that's such a unique and terrifying dynamic whenever he pops up in the comics. I hated that they gave Jigsaw a more handsome look to his scars and more of a broken mind than what we should have gotten. Even Ben Barnes who played the role wanted it to be more like the comics, but the fact that they killed him off completely takes away Punishers own nemesis. \n\n\nTwo, The Punisher is an R rated franchise of comics and storylines. Marvel and Kevin Feige said Deadpool will be the only R rated franchise for their MCU, and everything else won't be so that has me worried about Frank Castle. \n\n\nThree there are so many awesome and nasty villains in the Punisher comics such as Bushwacker, Ma Gnucci, Finn Cooley, Barracuda, Damage and more which is worrisome that we might not see them due to the Disney Brand tbh.","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678687643.0},{"title":"I'm seeing Quantumania for the third time tomorrow! :D","author":"TheAmericanCyberpunk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11p9jwl\/im_seeing_quantumania_for_the_third_time_tomorrow\/","text":"I saw it twice by myself on opening weekend.\n\nThe first time I went, I took some legal edibles that hit a little harder than I was expecting. Possibly as a result of that, I was, like, awestruck by the movie lol It started out okay and then progressively got more awesome with some minor flaws here and there. After the first act almost every scene worked for me on a profound emotional level. While I thought most of the performances were great- Paul Rudd, Cassie (I don't know the actress), Michelle Fighther (ironically misspelled), but Jonathan Majors as Kang is what sold it. I bought every one of his scenes. Him losing didn't bother me, for one, because I VERY much doubt that he's really dead, and, two, because it seemed more like the group got really lucky (which seems on tone for Ant Man movie, I don't think ending on a super dark note like Scott dying would have worked tonally) than them beating him through skill or strategy. I doubt they'll get lucky again, and when he returns I expect he will be vengeful, without mercy, and take at LEAST a couple major characters with him (possibly ones that got away in this film). Anyway, I CRIED when Scott was fighting Kang alone because I really thought he was going to die. Going into the movie, I would not have predicted that they'd kill off Scott, but I also would not have predicted that the movie would have been as serious as it was so killing Scott now seemed plausible. I like that they were able to convince me Scott was going to die, but still managed to give a pretty happy ending with similar tone to the rest of the trilogy. I didn't realize how hard the edibles hit until I tried to get up at the end and had trouble walking lol Then I accidentally left before the second post-credit scene.\n\nThe second time, I was mostly coming back because missing the second post-credit scene bothered me lol But I also wanted to see how I felt about the movie when I was sober. Still loved the movie, maybe not QUITE as much haha\n\nSome of my friends that I usually go see Marvel movies with had been busy with a work project, but I told them if they found the time that I really enjoyed it and would be down to see it again with them if they want to. So we're all going as a group tomorrow. I'm going to try to temper their expectations because while *I* loved it, many others felt differently. I suspect they will enjoy it though. \n\nI think this might be the ONLY MCU movie I've seen in theaters three times. I love it, giving it a 5\/5 star review. That doesn't mean it's perfect. It does have what I consider to be minor flaws here and there, mostly me not being crazy about some of the set up before they're pulled into the Quantum Realm, and also quite a bit with Modok not landing for me. Although, I did like the line \"It's never too late to stop being a dick.\" I will probably use that on someone at some point lol But a 5\/5 star score just means that whatever problems the movie had were so minor that they were massively outweighed by what worked for me in and that's why I love it.

Objectively, box office aside, she gave the best performance of all the ladies in her category. She was robbed.\n\nNow I know the exception seems to be the Joker character. They just love that character but that is NOT the only character with any depth and it is an insult to comics, comic films, and the fans of both to exclude these characters from the conversation.\n\nAlso, I have noticed more and more Marvel actors being invited to present. We know the ratings are down but to ride the wave of popularity yet ignore the craft is not okay. \n\nThe biggest winner of the night was Everything Everywhere All At Once.

It's very easy for an actor to go overboard or be a caricature when trying to play a tough-woman, alcoholic, with a traumatic backstory, but Ritter has just enough edge and knows when to keep things light and real. \n\nLuke Cage is never better than he is here, imo. Like Ritter, Colter plays him laid back with a fun side but never lets us forget this is a traumatized man.\n\nThey really start peppering in Trish's full story arc right from the beginning and Hogarth is great too. And New York looks amazing in the background.\n\nAnd Tennant. We don't even see him until episode three, I think, and yet right away he's this frightening figure. Kilgrave is, without a doubt, the best villain in any Marvel production. And Tennant shines in the role. As a Doctor Who fan to see him play this character is a treat.\n\nFinally, the reveals are actually shocking and meaningful. Too many shows play the audience with big reveals for shock value these days, but JJS1 really put some thought into what they were doing and how these reveals advanced the story and characters. The end of the first episode is perfect, imo.\n\nNo matter what happens in the future, I think we're lucky to have had shows like this, Daredevil, Luke Cage, etc. Street level comic book content with some edge and detailed storytelling.\n\nBut what do I know?

I went in without looking into any reviews beforehand, but knowing that the movie wasn't being reviewed quite well. I was expecting it to continue Phase 4's trend of spending a lot of time setting things up for the future of the MCU. This trend has started to drag down the quality of movies in the eyes of some critics and fans. I've generally been patient with Phase 4 and have enjoyed most of the movies quite a bit, but I was expecting there to finally be some payoff or at least some \"end game\" in sight after watching this movie. There isn't.  \n\n\n**What's the deal with Kang?**\n\nWe already knew Kang and his variants existed. We knew he was immensely powerful, knowledgeable, and capable after Loki. We knew that there was going to be a multiversal Kang war. We knew all about the multiverse and variants from not only Loki, but No Way Home and Dr. Strange too. So we've learned nothing new here. And not only have we learned nothing new, but nothing was expanded on at all and there were no new developments in the Kang war. The multiverse is literally in the exact same place before this movie as they were after it, and unless Ant-Man relays any info to other MCU characters (which why wouldn't they have shown that?), no one is any better off.  \n\n\n**Ok what about Ant-Man and the Wasp themselves?**\n\nAgain, literally in the exact same boat as before this movie. They started the movie as one big happy family (with the Pym's and Cassie) and ended it the same way. I'm shocked they didn't at least leave them trapped in the Quantum Realm. Bringing them back removed any \"sacrifice\" from Hope's act of coming back to save Scott. And Cassie being able to whip up a solution so quickly pretty much trivialized Kang's whole need for the core to get out (unless I missed that she used it to get back in).  \n\n\n**So were they trying to set up Cassie as a character?**\n\nIf this was their goal, not only did they fail at it, but it would be extremely disappointing to use Kang's grand introduction just for that. Cassie is the same good-hearted girl who loves her father that she's always been. Sure, they threw in that she's smart, gets into trouble, and has a suit now, but all of that was so underdeveloped that it literally could've been thrown in any other movie and would've had the same impact.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy didn't Kang and his storyline get developed any further? What are they trying to set up now? This was what all the set was for! To be honest, Kang should've won. He was right; he's The Conqueror and Ant-Man should not have been able to beat him. Beating him should've \\*at least\\* come at a cost, such as Scott and Hope being stuck in the Quantum Realm. That could have lead to further development of Cassie as she fights to get them back and given her or Hank a reason to clue other MCU characters into what happened. I was fine with waiting through a whole phase of set up. This is the first time I've actually started to doubt that the MCU is heading in a good direction.","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1678637977.0},{"title":"What happened to Kang The Conqueror in What If\u2026Zombies","author":"minhngth","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11pf5mj\/what_happened_to_kang_the_conqueror_in_what\/","text":"In What If season 1, episode 5, Janet Van Dyne contacted quantum virus which corrupted her brain and transformed into a zombie in a Quantum Realm.

The production value, acting, and direction are so top notch and I love that they really went for it in their story-telling. \n\nIt cracked me up thinking about how certain parties complain about how the Marvel properties today are going \"woke\" , but these shows seem way ahead of their time in many ways. You have married lesbian couples, gay police officers adopting a child, extremely diverse casts, and just very raw, open storylines. I think that struck me the most is that the shows are all gritty and most of the time feel real and of the time. \n\nOne aspect that stood out to me was how much of every show focused on mental health, spending time looking at the toll things took on the heroes, their friends and families, victims, and even the \"bad guys\" at times. Showing their humanity really made the characters feel believable and relatable.\n\nIf I had one complaint I suppose it's a bit of whiplash trying to keep up with how the public feels about our heroes. Knowing how fickle people are I suppose that is pretty realistic but it felt like a bit much at times.\n\nDaredevil- I feel like this show is the gold standard for what Marvel TV look should be. Perfectly cast with amazing performances. The fight scenes, especially that hallway fight early in Season One are exceptional. D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk is terrifying, he plays that role with a level of power and yet a bit of sensitivity that almost makes you feel for him at times. Then bringing in Jon Bernthal as The Punisher in Season 2 was a stroke of genius. I've never been a huge fan of the Hand storyline but still found it entertaining. I was very confused at the beginning of Season 3, and had to go back and rewatch The Defenders at that point to remind me of why Murdock was in such a bad place at that point.\n\nJessica Jones- I really enjoyed this one. She is really a true antihero, and I would argue Kilgrave is a top tier Marvel villain. Seasons 2 and 3 didn't quite pack the same punch without him but were still quite enjoyable.\n\nLuke Cage- Sweet Christmas do I love this show. The style they chose for this one is just perfect, integrating music and culture. I liked that Cage had a mysterious past and spent much of the first season trying to figure out who he was going to be. I will say it took a bit of a downturn when Mahershala Ali's Cottonmouth was killed off. He is such an amazing actor and character and they were just scratching the surface with him. I didn't enjoy the Diamondback character nearly as much. While I still enjoyed Season 2, I felt it was a step down and Luke's character was a bit wishy-washy for my taste. Misty Knight is such a bad ass, I was glad she got to shine in this one.\n\nIron Fist- Wasn't looking forward to this one as I have never been big on Finn Jones' portrayal of Danny Rand.  He somewhat grew on me though, and I found myself really enjoying the show overall. There are some really solid performances, especially Ward and Colleen's characters. I don't think I had seen Season 2 the first time around, and I think in many ways it was better than the first.\n\nThe Defenders- Solid team up series. Lots of great action scenes and some really hilarious dialog. A fun watch for sure.\n\nAlso... Can I just say... ROSARIO DAWSON. I love that she was a common thread throughout all these series. She always makes shows she is in better.\n\nIf you haven't watched these in a while or never seen them, they are definitely worth your time. It's also kind of a win that they made it into Disney+ intact with so much non-Disneyesque content.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678572167.0},{"title":"Who is the most Over-The-Top-Evil Villain in MCU?","author":"travelersharma","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/2i0uch24t3na1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678519789.0},{"title":"The worst things Captain America has ever done in MCU.","author":"Trait_Stories","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11o4880\/the_worst_things_captain_america_has_ever_done_in\/","text":"Superheroes are people too, and they have the right to make mistakes.

Also the universe keeps branching out all the time, and every branch is equally valid to be the successor for that number. Even if you say the people of 838 were observing part of the events during that incident and caught Beck saying that one is 616, so they used it as a reference point for their coordinate system, that universe would still have experience branching afterwards.","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1678570668.0},{"title":"For someone who wasn't raised on Marvel, please help me contextualize how big a deal Kang is.","author":"proactiveLizard","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11o9935\/for_someone_who_wasnt_raised_on_marvel_please\/","text":"So, I grew up on DC more than Marvel. I mean yeah sure one of my family members was into X-Men and I played the first Ultimate Alliance, but really I guess what helped was my school library having a big ol' encyclopedia of DC characters. That and following along with Blackest Night among other things. At any rate, having watched Quantumania, I'm faced with the question: is Kang a big deal, and if so how much?\n\nLet's consider an alternate universe where instead of the MCU taking off as it did, there was the DCEU. If they announced that the next arc villain was Darkseid, or the Anti-Monitor, or Nekron, I'd go \"Oh, that's a Big Deal\", because I have context for it. If they announced they were bringing in- say- Sinestro, I'd go \"That's a big deal for Green Lantern since he's one of GL's classic enemies, and it'd be even more of a big deal if they brought in the other Lantern Corps, but Sinestro isn't quite *as* big a deal as the other three\".\n\nNow, back in the real world, I don't have any major context for Kang. Like, I've heard Ultron can exponentially be a problem but they killed him off in his first movie and needed What If for him to flex. Thanos I knew was a Big Deal, and if they brought in Galactus or Dr. Doom I would go \"Oho, that's interesting!\" But apparently currently in Marvel comics there's some guy with a diamond on his head who turned the X-Men evil and they're asploding galaxies and I guess it reminds me that there's like hundreds of guys who could asplode the universe in either continuity so when I see Kang's the villain I go \"Okay, I guess?\"\n\nTLDR: How big a deal is Kang? Like, Doom? Galactus? Help me out here, guys.\n\nHindsight 20\/20 Edit: I would also like examples of his comic shenanigans, if you would be so kind","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678504463.0},{"title":"Which do you like better, Infinity War or Endgame, and why?","author":"macandcheesejones","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11p61zk\/which_do_you_like_better_infinity_war_or_endgame\/","text":"Really these movies could be one giant movie, so I'm curious as to which you like better and why.

Jen managed to calm down a little as she climbed out of the bed and only then, she noticed she was wearing an oversized AC\/DC t-shirt and shorts \"Bruce\"\n\nJen shouted hoping he would be within earshot but when no one answered she knew she would have to find him but the second she took a step forward a hologram of a brunette woman in a lab coat suddenly appeared before her \"Hello Ms. Walters, how can I assist you\"\n\nJen stood there for a second starring at the hologram woman unsure of what to make of her, the only thing she be sure of was that the woman seemed familiar but just couldn't place it \"um where am I and where is Bruce\"\n\n\"Ah yes, you are currently on a small island off the coast of Mexico, this is what you would call Bruce's sanctuary, a place for him to be alone and focus on his research\"\n\n\"right\"\n\n\"Bruce is currently located in the lab, I would be happy to show you the way\"\n\n\"Okay... lead on\"\n\nthe hologram woman turned on her heel and started to walk away, Jen was about to follow when suddenly out of instinct she turned to her left and said \"I guess Bruce hasn't gotten over his ex\"\n\nat that moment Jen remembered who the woman was, she was the striking resemblance of Betty Ross, but more importantly she questioned why she had done what she did, it almost felt like she was in a bad sitcom where the main character talks to the audience, but before she could ponder on this anymore the Hologram Betty looked back to see Jen still standing in the room \"is there a problem\"\n\nJen immediately snapped out of her daze and Betty \"everything is fine\"\n\nshe quickly joined Betty and followed her, but as they walked off, we return to the bedroom which seems empty but after a few seconds a floating video camera materializes out of thin air (like a ship from Star Trek De-Cloaking) it seems to hover there for a few seconds looking around the room before floating towards the entrance and cloaking again.\n\nJen followed the holographic Betty for a few minutes until they came upon a large underground lab where she found Bruce, now in his hulk form looking over a computer screen that was scrolling through various amounts of data \"Bruce?\"\n\nhe snapped out of his daze and turned to face Jen and Betty \"Jen you're awake\"\n\nhe then turned towards Betty \"thank you betty, you can go\"\n\nThe Holographic Betty did not respond but instead just nodded before blinking out \"did you sleep well\"\n\n\"no, you don't get start the conversation off with small talk, how did i get here, why am I here...\"\n\njust then the drive by shooting popped into her mind and quickly searched her body, to her surprise there wasn't a mark on her \"how... what... what happened\"\n\nBruce couldn't help but sigh as he took of his glasses \"after the drive by you were gravely injured and were bleeding out, the ambulance would have never made it so...

According to what he heard, the premise is going to center on Deadpool traveling across the multiverse with the X-Men. Not just Colossus, Negasonic Warhead, and Yukio, but major X-Men members from the X-Men films.\n\nThis was weeks before the announcement that Hugh Jackman would be returning as Wolverine for Deadpool 3. Hugh Jackman himself said that he decided to return in **late August of 2022**, the same exact time Cosmic Wonder heard about the rumor.\n\nLast month, Patrick Stewart said that Hugh Jackman told him to stand-by for Deadpool 3. Then later that month, Stewart suggested that he and Ian McKellen were both going to return as Professor X and Magneto.\n\nSo far, the rumor looks pretty legit at this point. It also seems like the movie might not even be titled \"Deadpool 3\". According to Daniel Richtman, the working title for the movie is \"Untitled Deadpool and Wolverine film\", which suggests that Wolverine will be in the title. This was later backed up by Hugh Jackman himself, who referred to it as \"Wolverine and Deadpool\". So it seems that Deadpool is going to share the spotlight with at least one character.\n\nWhat do you think?

BUT - I think the biggest problem is that \"the multiverse\" hasn't been a single unified concept, but a loose term that just lets each movie do whatever it wants.\n\nOut of the 7 movies in Phase 4, only two of them dealt with the multiverse: No Way Home and DSMOM.  And out of the 8 streaming series, only one directly deals with it: Loki.  WandaVision sets up Wanda's plot for DSMOM but does not deal with the multiverse itself.\n\nEven then, it seems like the main focus so far has just been to have wacky shenanigans that include a ton of outside characters.  Loki's main draw until the final episode is that they explore other versions of Loki himself.  No Way Home was fun to see a bunch of returning characters from old Spider-Man movies, but isn't based off anything from Loki directly.  And DSMOM (which I really enjoyed overall) doesn't contain carryover from Loki or Spider-Man (besides a throwaway line).\n\nI guess my main point is - the movies themselves need to give the audience a reason to care about the plot and characters outside of meta stuff like \"they're from the comics\" or \"they're from the old movie\".  Kang is being treated as a big deal mainly because he's a big deal in the comics.  Fantastic Four and X-Men are being anticipated, because comics fans know them already.  How would you explain to a 10 year old Avengers fan why he should be interested in Fantastic Four or X-Men?\n\nI know there's a long way to go AND that the Infinity Saga wasn't perfect either.  But I just think it's getting lazy that the stuff moving these movies and characters forward right now is \"remember them?\" or \"they're from the comics, get excited!\". \n\nI would've been fine if Phase Four even had less or nothing to do with the multiverse at all!  Just have Wong continue to explore magical anomalies, while characters like Captain America try to rebuild the Avengers.  Not every character needs to crossover eventually either.  I'm excited for The Marvels, but does Ms. Marvel need to have a cameo in Secret Wars?  No.  She's a kid and should be a local hero.  Does Spider-Man always need to be front and center with the main Avengers?  No, he's a young local hero.  But it's feeling more and more like everyone wants some giant \"epic\" team up where every single character is connected and included, even those from pre-MCU Marvel stuff.","upvote_ratio":0.45,"created_utc":1678474750.0},{"title":"The Multiverse Saga - Main Characters and Character Arcs","author":"dcgraca","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11n56kj\/the_multiverse_saga_main_characters_and_character\/","text":"After I read Bob Iger's response to introducing new characters and not focusing so much on old ones, made me wonder if Feige and Co. truly have a 10 year plan. I know\/hope they do.\n\nThe Multiverse Saga just began its middle phase and I don't know who the major players are yet aside from Kang (the big bad). So far Yelena has been in 2 projects, Loki has 2 seasons>! and a cameo in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania !< (but where will he show up next before The Kang Dynasty), Doctor Strange also has 2 appearences in the saga so far, but no Doctor Strange 3 has been officially confirmed, Ant-Man (the only guy who has come up against Kang) has no other appearence confirmed, Wanda's \"dead\" after 2 projects... That's one of my main issues with Phase 4 as of yet. No central figure, no hero like Tony to be face of this new saga. Honestly, Doctor Strange, Wanda, Loki or even Spider-Man would do but like I said there's no guarentee when they're coming back. Wanda would be the ideal one since she started the Multiverse Saga but she's dead so Elizabeth Olsen can go do other projects and come back for the big teamup movie. It'll be 3-4 years (depending if Kang Dynasty will be delayed) before we see her again. Same probably goes for Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Shuri and Thor.\n\nAnother problem that this response has me troubled is character arcs. I think Feige, Iger and the guys at Marvel need to start thinking about character arcs in the long picture. The 3 characters we lost in Endgame had really great arcs that spanned across 10 years (more Cap and Tony than Nat). Tony started off really selfish and ended his arc by sacrificing himself for the universe. Cap was a selfless soldier who saw morality as black and white and then turned his back on the US Governament and decided to retire from the fighting and went back to his time (a selfish decision that we all agree with). Nat wanted to wipe out the red on her ledger and die for a great cause and that's why killing her off made more sense than Clint. I know probably most of these arcs weren't planned beforehand, but looking back now after the saga has ended, they were great and well written. Having said this, Phase 4 had some really great arcs. Wanda's was my favorite (specially how her arc tied into the stages of grief and how she used the sitcoms and Westview to cope with her grief) until Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness threw that away because of a corrupted book and had her be the villain when Wanda accepted the loss of her children. I don't mind her reverting into a villain, but the way they did it felt like her arc in WandaVision was for nothing. Peter and Shuri had similar arcs pushed by the death of a mother figure though Peter's was the better written in my opinion and honestly I hope Spider-Man 4 is about the darkness inside Peter from sparing Green Goblin and not avenging Aunt May, being alone, seeing MJ with another guy and that being enhanced by the symbiote by the end of the movie. There were some attempts at characters with Doctor Strange in the sequel, Ant-Man's arc started off great, but was forgotten midway through, Shang-Chi's arc was alright (typical first entry hero arc) and who the hell remembers Thor's in Love and Thunder. Did he even have one? \n\nSo what I'm asking Feige and the rest of the people at Marvel is to consider placing a central figure in this new saga and when planning out future entries for their characters, think about their characters arcs and how they can evolve and grow in each movie and don't have them revert in the next one cause that was what happened with Wanda and Thor. At the end of the day, it is clear that the major problem with Marvel nowadays is the writing. In the Infinity Saga it was mostly bad\/forgettable villains and cinematography. In the Multiverse Saga it's mostly the writing. And that needs to greatly improve to restore the fans' faith in Marvel.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678399110.0},{"title":"Multiversal OG Avengers from the actual cinematic universe","author":"bigugly20","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11n50qo\/multiversal_og_avengers_from_the_actual_cinematic\/","text":"Let\u2019s get nuts- build your Avengers team using characters the OG actors have played in other movies.

Lizzie, Alex and the rest of their team have shared TONS of information, 163 scoops to be exact. From those, only 93 scoops can be verified at the moment and a staggering **91% of them were correct** (full list [here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/18Xrwgf-AzNmq3Bo46cNHUvoTLKD9Yre0vNr7pxz63WQ\/edit#gid=75747304)). For reference, Alex was the first to scoop that Marvel Studios is slowing down their Disney+ show output back in December, which was then confirmed by Feige in February and Lizzie was the first person to announce the Werewolf By Night Halloween Special.\n\nSecond is one of the verified sources of r\/MarvelStudiosSpoilers. That subreddit gets many scoops in their modmail and the mods go through a thorough verification process which has resulted in their trusted sources having a VERY high accuracy. Through the mods' sources, we have gotten full plot leaks for She-Hulk, Quantumania and The Marvels, the first 2 of which were correct (with the 3rd obviously pending), as well as smaller scoops like Kingpin appearing in Hawkeye.\n\nSuffice to say, both sources are EXTREMELY accurate, but plans always change, so always take these rumours with a grain of salt. For now, it seems this is plan though!\n\n# Actual Scoops\n\n* [Alex from the Cosmic Circus said last October](https:\/\/www.thecosmiccircus.com\/exclusive-lets-talk-about-damage-control-in-the-mcu\/) that the **Department of Damage Control** would be ONE of the villains of Armor Wars and in his article, he reminded us a couple of times that they have an Ultron head (as seen in Homecoming) which could be activated.\n* [Alex said in the Cosmic Circous Podcast 1 month ago](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MarvelStudiosSpoilers\/comments\/10xbhgy\/cosmic_circus_podcast_discusses_an_actor_who\/) that an actor is going to pop up in Armor Wars after years of being unable to play a certain character because his schedule has finally opened up.\n* One of r\/MarvelStudiosSpoilers' trusted source [revealed yesterday](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MarvelStudiosSpoilers\/comments\/11l6cp5\/tftmq_everything_is_delayed_edition\/) that James Spader will return as Ultron in Armor Wars, which is probably the actor Alex was talking about.\n\n**So the DODC and Ultron will be the villains in Armor Wars and the former will likely activate the latter** (either by mistake or on purpose).\n\nAlso, remember that according to Kevin Feige and Don Cheadle, the movie is a direct sequel of Secret Invasion and will pick up where that movie left off, so seeing Skrulls in the movie is probably not out of the question either!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think of this? Personally, my hype for the movie just skyrocketed! It'll be great to see Ultron again and the potential of Skrulls being behind the DODC and being the ones responsible for his reactivation is a very interesting prospect.

Some call him a god and some an anti-Christ type figure. Most believe him to be a hero in the mainstream public eye. This movie explores the fringe of the MCU  human public ( connecting to our far right and far left that dominate our news cycles ). \n\nAlso ties in Roxxon Corporation ( very relevant to todays corporations damaging\/exploiting for profit ). Company wants to unethically extract ice from nearby planet\u2019s moon, causing harm to it. Environmental activist, Rosalind Solomon, pleads to Thor by having him bring ice from Johuntheim under agreement of the Frost Giant\u2019s (they are now chill with Thor for stopping Loki from totally annihilating their realm in Thor 1). Thor agrees and enlists Hulk for this task to help on logistics. The ice from Johuntheim eliminates the need from Roxxon which causes their stock to dip and the CEO of Roxxon, Darrio Agger, to fury against Thor. \n\nDarrio begins paying social media farms to create division amongst the public on Thor\u2019s general existence and role on Earth. Rosalind tells Thor much of the horrific impacts on underprivileged people and the environment caused by Roxxon\u2019s extraction processes which has a deep impact on Thor. Thor, believing he is right in defending people from Roxxon and while also having had relapsed to heavy drinking (Endgame style) after becoming obsessed with his portrayal on social media, attacks a Roxxon facility, barely hindering their operations but causing a media firestorm mostly fueled by Darrio as he plants a story on how several workers were killed and injured, a lie but it catches the headlines and sours Thor\u2019s public image further. This causes Thor to head down the rabbit hole of depression and substance abuse. \n\nDario forcefully builds a factory near New Asgard in response to Thor\u2019s attack. This creates a polluting affecting on the Asgardian\u2019s new homeland. Valkyrie pleads to Thor to help her find a way to stop them non-violently but he is despondent and unwilling to help. Dario has also staffed the factory with the anti-Thor cult members and housed them for free in a nearby development he has built. He has managed to achieve the highly invasive construction projects for the factory and community development through his vast and brutal team of Roxxon lawyers. He has also filed a massive lawsuit against Thor. Scene with Matt Murdock and She-Hulk (Bruce sent me) where they try to levy the seriousness of the legal implications which he laughs off and tells them to leave enraged. He becomes increasingly upset while continuing to drink and heads to the new Roxxon town intending to levy it in a drunken rage. It is a trap and Darrio is there along with the the town\u2019s police who is the anti-Thor cult members heavily armed. They also have an abundance of cameras set up to livestream the ensuing violence. He must decide to back off or fight, the latter further damaging his reputation having sworn to protect the people of Earth and already falsely having to be perceived to have caused injury to a couple innocents (Sakovia Accords can be referenced). He decides to flee in a moment of clarity but just then, an Asgardian group of rioters show up to back him. He attempts to convince them back down but after being provoked by the militia, a fight breaks out against Thor\u2019s best efforts. It results with the death of a couple militia members and the injury of many. Thor and the Asgardian\u2019s are slandered in the public eye. \n\nThor, now having to hide against lawsuits and public backlash, is drinking his sorrows away in his Asgardian hut. Much like in Endgame, Hulk and Roz visit him and tell him he should rebound as Roz\u2019s underground efforts to hack Roxxon have had a recent success. Her team found blatant documents and communication chains about Darrio\u2019s knowing and active support of very unethical activities against New Asgard for profit and they leaked it to the press an hour ago. The three watch as the story is released, hailed as massive breaking news at first, then declared fake news by Roxxon and then it is quickly overshadowed by an election scandal. The three look defeated and begin drinking heavily. \n\nThe next day, the hungover trio awaken to a small protest at Roxxon HQ in NYC being broadcasted on the news in light of the data breach which is ended with a denial quote from Roxxon and quickly overshadowed by a different story once again . After realizing Thor has caused far more damage than good, he summons the bifrost to bring him to the protest where he joins peacefully. However, the police quickly attempt to arrest him, almost causing a riot, which Thor dismantles by talking down the protesters. He drops Stormbreaker in front of Roxxon HQ and they bring him to a secret high max security prison in NYC built for extremely high powered super heroes (Easter eggs galore). \n\nHere, he reflects on his wrongdoings, attends therapy for his depression and substance abuse, and comes to terms with the power he holds and how he should use it, ultimately deciding to let them rest while atoning in NYC. \n\nEnd credit scene 1: A 5 years later card  is flashed. A news sequence reveals Thor\u2019s public image is restored and Darrio Agger has been removed as CEO of Roxxon despite the company\u2019s continued success. We see Thor still incarcerated in NYC. He is approached from the darkness by Sam Wilson and Carol Danvers who scorn him on the bedlam he had caused on Earth, but appreciate how he ended things peacefully and accepted imprisonment. They also point out how they know Darrio is one of the most unethical people but superhero\u2019s can\u2019t commit unsanctioned attacks against a CEO committing unethical acts. The three acknowledge the grey area of not being able to defend the weak against corporations being something they\u2019ll never be able to come to terms with. Sam and Carol enlists him to join in battles surrounding the aftermath of New World Order and the oncoming multiversal battles. They acknowledge Thor has served his time in solitude and need help against a greater threat. Thor agrees and the movie ends with Carol handing him Stormbreaker and Thor becoming an Avenger once again. This sets up his involvement on the team in Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars. \n\nEnd credit scene 2: Zeus is scolding Hercules for not tracking down Thor yet. They are in a bar and Hercules is heavily inebriated, surrounded by women. Hercules says something along the lines of \u201cIll get to it\u201d. This becomes an ongoing gag in end credit scenes moving forward.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678327104.0},{"title":"Captain America:NWO taking on Supremacy and racism","author":"adamAlexanderGreen","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11m9git\/captain_americanwo_taking_on_supremacy_and_racism\/","text":"With rumors of Captain America\u2019s Upcoming Movie being centered on White supremacy groups and Imperialism; Do you think Marvel can pull off a Successful and critical acclaim Hit? \n\nSam Wilson going against the New President Ross executive orders to seize Tiamut island and Wakanda\u2019s weakens State.

It\u2019s a bit clich\u00e9 and overdone. He also recommended it go more towards the monster side of the MCU\u2026and I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of that. Awesome idea! So, I decided to revise my idea and come up with something new:\n\nOpen on three young hunters (Paul, Georges and Henri) lost in the Canadian wilderness. Have dialogue between the three of them reveal that it has already been many days. Then, they get attacked by wolves and Henri becomes critically injured. They all move into a cave. At this point, they\u2019re all basically starving to death. Henri eventually dies and Paul, after much hesitation, decides to eat his dead friend. When he does, an old magic surrounds him and he is transformed into\u2026something. Don\u2019t reveal what the creature looks like, maybe show the transformation via shadows like the old horror movies, or maybe something more modern, like a partial reflection in Georges glasses. Show the creature kill Georges and run into the Canadian wilderness.\n\nNow cut to Banner doing Banner-y things. He is then confronted by Department H and asked for help. They say they\u2019re putting together a team to go after something in the Canadian wilderness. He is shown footage of an unknown assailant picking off multiple teams of Department H operatives one by one. He is told that all they know is none of their weapons seem to damage him in any way that matters, mentioning that he is seemingly unkillable. They now reveal that the other members of the team have already been chosen. Now reveal Blade and Elsa Bloodstone. Blade because the victims have sometimes been drained of blood, and Elsa because she is a well known monster hunter. They tell Banner that they want him, a seemingly unkillable Avenger, to lead this group. He accepts and decides to go after this unkillable entity.\n\nNow show a woman who is revealed to be Marie the older sister of Paul, one of the now missing hunters. Maybe have her filing a missing person\u2019s report or something. Have a scene showing the police doing very little and her beginning to look for her brother on her own, starting in the area where the hunters told her they would be going. She is determined to find him and rescue him. She eventually finds the blood soaked cave where two of the hunters remains were left. But not her brother. So she continues on and eventually come to a town. She begins hearing stories of livestock being gutted and people going missing. During her investigation, have her come across an eldery native American couple. She begins to tell the couple about her missing brother and how she found his friends all killed, having looked eaten. They tell her about a long forgotten native American legend. A curse that is put on people that consume the body of another man, who then turns into a beast, the Wendigo, who thirsts for more blood. This changes the actual legend of the Wendigo quite a bit, and I mean no disrespect to Native American culture, I just thought this could be the Earth 616 Wendigo legend while we have our own.\n\nNow, cut to Banner, Blade and Elsa being dropped in the Canadian wilderness. Have them searching a crime scene of people, maybe Department H soldiers torn to shreds. Have one of the team members sense something and out of the shadows emerges a figure who we cant quite make out, but the scene illudes to whoever this is being the culprit. A fight ensues and Banner being over confident, rushes in but gets immediately injured by the assailant, who has some kind of weapon able to pierce Banner\u2019s skin. This causes him to lose a little of the control he has over his angry side and we see a little of old, rageful hulk come out after he heals up. Eventually the unknown assailant is subdued. It is revealed that the assailant is not the one who committed these heinous acts, but instead is none other than Wolverine, also on the trail of this monster. You could also split this into a couple of confrontations instead of just one. Maybe have Wolverine escape the first confrontation and have them still think it is him who killed the soldiers. Then have the team track him and finally find him at another crime scene, this time finally subduing him and finding out the truth.\n\nAfter we find out it is Wolverine they discovered, cut to a scene that shows James Howlett before the blip. Have him sitting in a bar in the middle of nowhere Canada, drinking and smoking a cigar, when suddenly half the people in the bar turn to dust. He however, has a different experience. As he begins to dust, make it clear that it is happening slower for him because his healing factor is fighting the dusting. Show him endure agonizing minutes of being ripped apart atom by atom until he finally fully dusts outside in the snowy cold. Show 5 years pass and have the bar now abandoned. When he reappears outside the bar, due to the agonizing trauma he just endured, is now in a basically feral, berserker state. He proceeds to kill some of the others who reappear in the bar in his enraged state. He runs off into the wilderness but is eventually caught by unknown soldiers. He is shown being experimented on and tortured until he finally escapes back into the Canadian wilderness (only a quick scene of him in a facility because you have to show him getting his adamantium. My thought is, if he had his adamantium before the blip, it wouldn\u2019t blip with him, so you have to show him getting it after he blips back). Have him make it to the same town Marie found herself (but earlier obviously), where he stays for a time until there is suddenly a murder in the town. People ripped to shreds in their home. The people turn on him because he is the only outsider so he has to escape again and now wants to clear his name and catch the real killer.\n\nCut back to Wolverine having been subdued by the team and have him explain that when he investigated the murdered family, he caught the scent of something he\u2019s never smelled before and began to track it (I think it would be cool to finally show Wolverine doing some solid wilderness tracking, using his heightened senses). They then all decide to go after the real killer together.\n\nThis is where my ideas start to get a little vague. Basically show the team tracking the monster, showing more of Wolverines tracking skills. Eventually, have them come upon where the creature has been hiding. This of course leads to a confrontation between the monster and the team. As a fight ensues, it is discovered that Marie has also been able to track down the lair of the monster. She is unsure if the monster killed her brother, or is her brother. So, she intervenes in the fight just as Wendigo is about to be beaten who then escapes. She explains the story of the curse and that she isn\u2019t sure if this monster just completely consumed her brother, or if her brother is the cursed monster, but have her be hopeful and lean towards the side that it is her brother because the monster left remains of the other victims, but no remains of Paul had been found. Blade reveals that he knows some magic, most notably a way to lift curses, but that it comes at a cost. You cannot just remove a curse; it has to be then bound to another host and eradicated. Marie quickly volunteers to have the curse put on her and then be killed to get rid of the curse. I think the group should decide to instead put the curse on Hulk (because Marie trying to move the curse onto hulk was part of the comic hulk 181) but that would need an explanation of why that I can\u2019t think of. Maybe just that because he is already the hulk, they think that he probably won\u2019t turn into another thing, so maybe he can just hold the curse. I\u2019m not sure about that though.\n\nSo they all go back to the town and decide to lure and trap Wendigo instead of going after him and fighting him. They lure him to the town and are able to capture him for a time, during this time Elsa uses the bloodstone to read the creatures mind and discovers it is in fact Maries brother Paul trapped by this curse. However, their plan does not go according to plan and Wendigo is able to escape and fight back. Another battle ensues in the town now. In this battle have Wolverine try to just kill Wendigo but have the others stop him (this will characterize Wolverine as not quite being his X-Men self yet). Elsa finally uses the Bloodstone to make an illusion which tricks Wendigo and Blade and Banner are able to land final blows that critically damage (but not kill) Wendigo.\n\nAgain, the ending I am not so sure about. They could either successfully put the curse onto Banner and have the hulk just overtake the curse. But that seems to easy. Or you could have Paul end up sacrificing himself; as they remove the curse and he reverts back to human form, saying to just kill him and he takes the curse back into himself and then Wolverine kills him. Or Marie could take the curse and sacrifice herself for her younger brother (lots of stories have involved big brothers helping younger sisters, but it would be interesting to see an older sister sacrifice herself for her younger brother instead). I\u2019m not really sure though (would love to hear people\u2019s thoughts on the ending especially).\n\nThen the team would go their separate ways, Wolverine having cleared his name, the trio (Banner, Blade and Elsa) having solved the murderers and Marie having found out what happened to her brother. This would also be a slight introduction to the Midnight Suns, giving a reason why Wolverine, Blade, Elsa and Hulk all know each other and could later reunite (at least partially) for a Midnight Suns project. You could also maybe have Banner mention to Wolverine that a new school just opened in New York for people like him, illuding to the X-Men.\n\nAlso, I hope this is obvious but this is clearly just a quick, first draft, so there are probably some plot holes and things that would need to be expanded a bit, but  nonetheless, I would love to hear what people think!

This is going to be a bit of a rant\/vent post, but I need to get it off my chest. Seeing the reactions to the news yesterday has just further proven that this show doesn\u2019t stand a chance. In my mind at least. The original show was amazing and I love it, and born again has a big legacy to live up to but\u2026 it isn\u2019t and probably was never going to be \u201cseason 4\u201d of the original show.

I am definitely bummed and confused by the omission of foggy\/Elden and Karen, but there are so many things about this show that we still don\u2019t know, in fact we barely know anything so getting all riled up and saying the show is worthless and a piece of garbage is ridiculous because we don\u2019t know if they will just come in later episodes or if they\u2019ll explain their absence in some way.

Her story arch was damsel I distress to reporter in distress. There isn\u2019t much left else for her but to eventually meet Bullseye. \n\nAnt-Man Quantumania was a good example of how NOT to write characters, and now they are cutting out two who were written decently. The most effort put into a Netflix Marvel show was clearly Daredevil. Obviously the same amount of love wasn\u2019t put into Iron Fist and that showed. \n\nAll in all while some of us will be upset, we\u2019re still going to watch the show and still hope it\u2019s entertaining, lives up to the lore, and adds value the MCU. Most importantly, doesn\u2019t just become shovelware to set up the next movie\/show. \n\nThe chemistry between Cox, Woll and Henson was amazing and really made the show work perfectly. But that show is over. The MCU has plenty of other characters who are just normal people and Foggy and Karen for Matt to meet. It\u2019s time for a change. \n\nI guess we'll never see the law firm of Nelson, Murdock and Page in action. Unless they comeback for season 2 of Born Again. Whatever. It\u2019s not really a big deal. If they come back. Cool. If they don\u2019t come back. Cool. We\u2019re getting more Daredevil guys. It\u2019s a win.","upvote_ratio":0.35,"created_utc":1678280476.0},{"title":"do you think that Scarlet witch\/wonda is a villain or hero or morally Gray?","author":"Flimsy_Tune_7206","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11lhep1\/do_you_think_that_scarlet_witchwonda_is_a_villain\/","text":"The Question that I am asking is what do you think about Scarlet witch\/Wanda character and do you think that she a villain or hero or Molly Gray character and why do you think that you don't have to go into detail about what you think about her character but I think it would be nice if you explain your reasoning or why you think the way you do about her character that's all.

Whether that\u2019s giving a new character their own movie or having a new character be introduced in someone else\u2019s movie.\n\nThat accomplishes three things:\n1. The new character instantly feels connected to the larger MCU if they\u2019re introduced in someone else\u2019s movie. Black Panther, Spider-Man, Wanda, Vision, Hawkeye, Black Widow. Mostly all beloved characters and all introduced in someone else\u2019s movie.\n\n2. Movies are much more accessible for the general public than streaming shows. This is obviously a personal example but my parents were following the MCU very easily when all the content was in the theaters. The moment they needed to watch 6-9 episodes on some streaming service then they started falling way behind. \n\n3. Moon Knight is a great example of a character I think is strong enough for his own movie. And honestly it would be kind of hard to introduce him in someone else\u2019s movie because he\u2019s so complicated. Ms. Marvel could be either or. She-Hulk could he introduced in someone else\u2019s movie as well. \n\nI know, I know the business required that they put content on Disney+ but I\u2019m just saying what would be better.

Similarly, editors can take a subpar film and turn it into something much more entertaining and engaging by playing with the pacing and coherence of the plot especially if they can utilize some good b-roll footage and some quick ADR to create better and more coherent transitions.\n\nAnd then, there are directors who take a masterpiece of a script and mess it up in the execution or editors who get a palatable movie and chopilly put it together to make it outright unwatchable.\n\n**The quality of the final cut IS NOT indicative of the quality of the script and vice versa!**\n\nBut, I digress. Let's get to the point of this post which is to showcase some of the changes made to Quantumania from page to screen that we know through leaks and production info.\n\n1. **The original ending had Ant-Man and the Wasp stuck in the Quantum Realm at the end.** They reshot that 1 month before the movie came out. We know that because [the entire movie's plot leaked last October](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MarvelStudiosSpoilers\/comments\/yckepo\/tales_from_the_mod_queue_quantumania_plot_leak\/) and the plot leak was 99% correct with the only difference being the ending. We also have set pics from the reshoots and they show [Scott walking down the street in San Francisco with Cassie's cake](https:\/\/twitter.com\/paulruddcom\/status\/1611812651675385858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1611812651675385858%7Ctwgr%5E66b25dc38a4ec339e534c8fdf5e6bad24745aa2c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.comingsoon.net%2Fmovies%2Fnews%2F1259581-ant-man-3-set-photos-confirm-ongoin-reschoots), and [the rest of the actors in the attire they were wearing to Cassie's fake birthday party](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MCU_Covered\/status\/1612788852296503298), which indicates that the ending in the final cut was only shot in January's reshoots. The ending changing is basically all but confirmed.\n2. The trailers had a line of dialogue where Kang told to Scott that he could offer him more time with Cassie which would give Scott a better arc in the movie. That was most definitely cut but we know that it exists and was likely in Loveness' script.\n3. One of r\/MarvelStudiosSpoilers' trusted sources (they go through a very thorough verification process with their sources and their verified info has up till now been EXTREMELY reliable) said [back in July](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MarvelStudiosSpoilers\/comments\/w19bq5\/tales_from_the_mod_queue_eternals_2_quake_the\/) that Krylar raises an army of humanoid aliens from the Quantum Realm to try to defeat Kang\/MODOK. This source was also the first (and only) to mention Hank's army of ants and the name Victor Timely being heard in the film, both of which were true. One of the most reliable leakers CanWeGetSomeToast (essentially everything he has leaked until now that can be confirmed, HAS been confirmed as true, and he has shared a quite a lot of stuff about several projects; he even leaked [an actual picture of MODOK's middle part](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/ih5mub3e5pn91.jpg) months before the movie), [revealed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/CanWeGetToast\/status\/1628127630019989528) after the movie had come out that Krylar was originally going to turn on Kang and fight back with the rest of the freedom fighters, corroborating the previous leak.\n4. CanWeGetSomeToast also [revealed a few days after the movie's release](https:\/\/twitter.com\/CanWeGetToast\/status\/1627412123977392128) that the Freedom Fighters played a much bigger role in Cassie\u2019s development in the Quantumania script that he read.\n\n**So, it seems like there was a version of the script where Scott and Cassie's arcs were more fleshed out and not half-assed, the Freedom Fighters had a bigger role and actually helped propel Cassie's development, the ending had more stakes and was more bittersweet, and even Krylar had a redemption arc and bigger role in the film rather than a glorified cameo.**\n\nAll that stuff as well as some better editing could have made the movie much, much better.\n\nJudging from the choppy editing of the film in general, it seems to me that the script and what they had initially shot was quite different to what we got at the end.\n\nI don't know why all that stuff (and potentially even more stuff) was cut. Was it the studio not liking it? Was it the director? Was it just people in test screenings not responding well to some of it? Either way, it doesn't sound much like a script problem to me. And even if it was, we couldn't have known by just watching the final cut.\n\nFor another example of this, Thor: The Dark World was also partially written by Markus and McFeely (although they only came in later for rewrites), and despite their skills and the skills of the amazing writer Christopher Yost and the competent, Game of Thrones director, Alan Taylor, the movie was still shit.\n\nFrom the accounts of Taylor himself, it was Perlmutter, Fine and the Marvel Creative Committee who basically interferred with the movie's editing heavily and chopped the film so much that Taylor didn't even want to take a director's credit considering how different it was from the film he shot.\n\nI have a feeling something similar was the case with Quantumania, but I can't figure out why.","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678134657.0},{"title":"I now own every MCU tie in comic (save for AoS The Chase)!","author":"CdotasAlways","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/w36w5b28y6ma1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678121980.0},{"title":"Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania passed the $400M global mark this weekend.","author":"Viz0077","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BORReport\/status\/1632413660252622849?t=wNmQdobCiKX4ojsm5rsJwg&s=19","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678039368.0},{"title":"Casual Jessica Jones Cosplay | @figglybuff","author":"_figgysmalls","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/giob65rfx1ma1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678061183.0},{"title":"How I want to see Wolverine Introduced into the MCU","author":"grundlesquatch","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11kneql\/how_i_want_to_see_wolverine_introduced_into_the\/","text":"I saw a concept written up by another redditor on here, however I forgot to save it so unfortunately, I cannot give credit where credit is due. This redditor had an amazing idea for how to introduce Wolverine into the MCU so I wanted to expand it a bit. His\/her idea was to have a sort of reverse of the comic introduction of Wolverine, where Wolverine is an agent tasked to go after the Hulk. Obviously, the Hulk is already an established character in the MCU so it would no longer make sense to have him rage out and need Wolverine to come and stop him. However, you could do the opposite. You could have Hulk asked by someone (maybe Department H) to go after an unkillable rogue experiment in the Canadian wilderness. I decided to expand this Redditors great idea a little bit so hear me out:\n\nThe movie opens up in a government facility suddenly going through a red alert for an escaped experiment. Never fully showing who it is, show flashes of guards and military personnel being torn apart. Cut to a snowy Canadian wilderness and the outside of the hidden facility, a door is cut off its hinges and falls to the ground, out stumbles a man, naked covered in blood. He runs out into the snow and screams. Not showing his face, but finally revealing who it is, a newly escaped Wolverine.\n\nNow cut to Banner doing Banner-y things. He is then confronted by Department H and asked for help. He is shown footage of an unknown assailant picking off multiple teams of Department H operatives one by one. He is told that all they know is none of their weapons seem to damage him in any way that matters, mentioning that he is seemingly unkillable. Now, this begs the question, why Banner? I think firstly because he is another seemingly unkillable human or you could add something in about detecting Gamma radiation experiments at the facility so they need an expert. Either way, he accepts and decides to go after this unkillable entity. You could also add some comic relief in here by having him with She-Hulk, and have her ask, don\u2019t you want my help or something like that, and have Department H respond, we would rather have the Avenger. Just an idea that popped into my head.\n\nNow, cut to Banner being dropped in the Canadian wilderness. Show him searching crime scenes or something like that. I don\u2019t have all the specifics thought up already, but basically this finally leads to an initial confrontation between the two. Banner\/Hulk is of course over-confident because he thinks he is unkillable. However, when they do finally meet, have Wolverine just stealthily start beating the shit out of Hulk who quickly realizes that his enemy's adamantium claws can cause him damage like it would anyone. Basically, have a cat and mouse chase of sorts between the two where they keep having confrontations and Banner keeps getting beaten by this mystery person who he doesn\u2019t even fully see at first. Another thought is that because Hulk is actually taking damage, this weakens his control over his anger. Each confrontation gets him more and more angry which finally climaxes in the actual Hulk coming back out and the two having a full on battle. Finally ending in both being pretty beat up. I see this entire portion being a pretty decent chunk of the movie even though my description is brief. \n\nAfter this fight, have Banner regain some control and he goes back to being the Banner\/Hulk or going back to full human from being so exhausted. Then have an exhausted and currently healing Wolverine reveal what has been going on at the facility, known only as Weapon X to him, because this is what they referred to him as (he of course has no memory, maybe have him pick the name Logan or find it somehow).  Have them both decide that they need to put an end to what is going on at the facility.\n\n When they get to the facility, they are of course met with a barrage of soldiers. Have Banner try to convince Wolverine to incapacitate the guards in a non-lethal manner, but he disregards Banners advice and says that these people have been experimenting on him for ages, and that they deserve to die. This characterizes Wolverine as not yet being the X-Men version of himself, giving him room to grow as a character. This ends up leading to another confrontation between Wolverine and the Hulk. Hulk manages to save some of the men, who run off into the wilderness. Maybe after throwing him through a wall or something and being left with no one to kill, Wolverine finally calms down again and he and Banner search the facility, which they discover has been hastily packed up and abandoned. \n\nThe ending I\u2019m not completely sure about yet, so this part is vague. Obviously, they part ways at some point. This could be a good part for easter eggs. Maybe have Banner mention a new school that just opened up in New York for people with gifts like him. Also have Banner report everything back to Department H. Now the weapon x project is on the radar of Department H and the Hulk and can be kept as a player for future projects.\n\nSo, what do people think of this? Would anyone watch this movie or am I the only one? The one problem I foresee with this idea is that I think they already have a set plan for Hulk in the MCU, maybe leading to a World War Hulk situation. However, this could be an intermediary story for Hulk, maybe having a post credit scene of this directly leading into the World War Hulk storyline or whatever storyline they have in store for him. I don\u2019t know guys; I think this would be pretty awesome! Please share any ideas or critiques you have about this in the comments. I definitely want to know what people think.","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1678158750.0},{"title":"How will the entire Marvel cinematic franchise end?","author":"Quinzerrak","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11kepwt\/how_will_the_entire_marvel_cinematic_franchise_end\/","text":"Marvel Studios has become quite a massive enterprise, bearing an interesting and expansive universe -- or should I say multiverse -- with loads of stories.

And both invasions left very lasting consequences to the people of the MCU.\n\nWell this time, it's even worse because this invasion is secret since those specific aliens can take the form of anybody. That should have huge consequences for the stabilityof the world at large. How do you learn to trust anybody after that?\n\n**Now, I am not expecting the Avengers to assemble in this series to stop the Skrulls.** They will probably find a narrative that works without them. Like maybe Fury is afraid that the Avengers could have been compromised and he doesn't trust anybody else other than himself and Talos (who is already a Skrull). They could even take the abscence of the Avengers as a future plot point and have the US government blame them for not being ther when they needed them, which would prompt Val and Thunderbolt Ross to introduce the the Thunderbolts to the public as the new Avengers.\n\nI also know the show will focus more on the political aspect of the invasion with Skrulls likely impersonating government officials. I love all that, that's great. It kinda makes more sense than them impersonating super-heroes to be honest considering it's the governments that actually have control over the people, not the heroes.\n\nBut because of how huge this event is, I want to see characters from many corners\/sub-franchises of the universe.\n\nWe already know **Rhodey** (an *Iron Man* character) and **Everett Ross** (a *Black Panher* character) are appearing. \n\nOther characters that would fit:\n\n* **Sharon Carter**, a *Captain America* character, who has infiltrated the CIA and has a huge influence on the black market; definitely someone the Skrulls would want on their side and a character who is already wildly theorized to be a Skrull (and rightfully so). Ross also used to be her boss, so there's a connection with a character already confirmed for the series.\n* **Val**, a.. well she's not associated with any specific franchise, but she is the director of the CIA now and she was apparently married to Ross who is now on the run in this very series, after she had him arrested, meaning she would want to find and catch him again. Val also seems to be taking Norman Osborn's role from the Secret Invasion\/Dark Reign comic arc, where Osborn kills the Skrull Queen, stops the invasion, the president makes him the new director of SHIELD and his Thunderbolts team (the very team Val is assembling) become the official, new Avengers. Val could very well do the same here and kill Gravik, the Rebel Skrulls' Leader who is behind the invasion. It would also be cool if Gravik is impersonating the US President, Ritson, and the Val in Wakanda Forever is not even our real Val, but a Skrull-Val and that's why Ritson appointed her director of the CIA (we learned in WF that she is the NEW director)\n   * And since we're talking about Val, it would be cool if **a few of the Thunderbolts** appeared as well. Since part of the series will be taking place in Russia, during Unity Day no less, one of their biggest national celebrations, meaning they aren't gonna use the country just for its cool locations, but Russia's culture will act the backdrop for a portion of the series, **Yelena and Alexei**, 2 *Black Widow* characters, would be cool and narratively meaningful cameos. Maybe it's Alexei's first mission for Val and Yelena is showing him the ropes while he is just excited to be able to be a hero again and bond with his daughter. It would be cool to revisit their dynamic and set the stage for the Thunderbolts movie. **US Agent**, another *Captain America* character, would also be a cool addition too, whether he is the only Thunderbolt we see or he teams up with Yelena and Alexei, because I have really missed him and I believe he would 100% fit the setting of the series. Maybe Val has sent them after Ross. They don't need to appear in more than 1 episode and for more than a few minutes during an actions sequence. That's enough to make the series feel like a true, huge crossover between many corners of the universe.\n* **Monica Rambeau**, a *Captain Marvel* and *WandaVision* character, who I honestly thought they would have confirmed for the series by now, considering a Skrull invited her in Fury's space station at the end of WandaVision, which I thought at the time was a very obvious set-up for her appearance in Secret Invasion. She would be so perfect for this series as she is one of the few humans alive, besides Fury, who has had a close-up interaction with Skrulls. She is also the director of SWORD by now most likely and if Fury and Talos are now agents of SWORD, I would love to see her take a step back and be in a more administrative role, giving order to the protagonist duo throughout the series. Also, if the rumour is true and >!Emilia Clarke is playing Talos' daughter, Monica already became friends with her when they were both little kids in Captain Marvel and it would be a great pay-off to see them reunite.!<\n* Some of the **Dora Milaje and\/or the Midnight Angels**, who are also *Black Panther* characters, would also fit great here due to their connection with Ross. It was really cool when Ayo showed up in TFATWS and it gave her character a bit more depth and importance before WF. I would like a similar surprise where maybe **Aneka**, or even **Okoye**, shows up this time, and helps Ross out of a difficult situation. Or maybe Wakanda has also been infiltrated by Skrulls and Ross calls calls them to inform them of the threat they pose. It would be very cool to see how the Skrull Invasion affects Wakanda. Considering it's \"open to the world\" now, the Skrulls would definitely try to infiltrate it too. Maybe they use this a set up for the Okoye\/Midnight Angels show they're making.\n* **DODC Agent Cleary**, a *Ms. Marvel* and *Spider-Man* character, would be great for the series as well and due to his lesser popularity and importance as a character, it would feel like a more subtle appearance rather than a \"Leo pointing at the screen\" moment like most MCU cameos. Especially since the DODC is confirmed to be appearing in the series and Cleary has also been theorized to be a Skrull for quite sometime.\n* **FBI Agent Jimmy Woo**, an *Ant-Man* character, would be really cool too. We have been talking about the DODC, SWORD and the CIA and considering Olivia Colman is playing an agent in the series too, MI6 is probably involved too, so it wouldn't be too odd to include the FBI in the series in some way as well. If Monica appears, it makes Woo's appearance more likely and more rewarding as their friendship from WandaVision could be paid off in a scene where they help each other in a mission. Also, since Woo has been a SHIELD agent in the comics, I would love to see him interact with Fury in the MCU.\n\nNot ALL of these characters have to appear and even if they do, they certainly don't need to have big roles, but just their presence in the series and even their most tiny contribution to the plot would make the world feel more tightly connected and make the series feel that it has large consequences accross many corners and for many different characters in the MCU.\n\nWhat do you think? What other character would you like to see and which of these do you think is likely that we do see? I believe that Val and Monica, maybe even Sharon if she is indeed a Skrull, are by far the most likely, even to the point that I would be surprised not to see them.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678119755.0},{"title":"Is there anyone want fake documentary about Thanos' snap?","author":"BeneficialSide2335","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11k8mft\/is_there_anyone_want_fake_documentary_about\/","text":"I really want it.

When they found the early hominids of Earth, they ran tests and experiments and noticed a gene in the DNA of some of them which could offer them great powers through mutation. \n\nThis was what will later become known as the X-Gene. \n\nThe Celestials altered the DNA of those humans and silenced that gene because they feared its extreme potential and then modelled the Eternals after those humans, trying to recreate some potential powers that the X-gene could offer to humans like super speed, super strength, flight, transfiguration, faster healing etc, giving a unique power to each Eternal. \n\n>\\[Note: That's my reasoning about why all Eternals externally look like humans and have unique powers that are similar to many mutants' powers. It is also my way of reconciling both the original history of the X-gene from the early comics which presented it as something natural, and the retconned history they introduced a few years ago where the Celestials created the X-gene. I think a middle ground would be the X-gene existing naturally, but the Celestials still playing some kind of role; a role that acts as the explanation about why mutants aren't already common in the MCU.\\]\n\nThen, millions of years later, the Kree were scouring the universe, visiting planets with species they could perform experiments on to create expendable soldiers to fight their wars. They encountered the descendants of those humans with the X-gene and made a genetic enhancer to counter the genetic silencer of the Celestials (enhancers are DNA sequences that activate genes while silencers are ones that deactivate them or limit their expression).\n\nTheir experiments worked on only one subject (Hive if we want to go by AoS lore), but that subject rebelled against them and killed most of them. The Kree were using a revolutionary technology of space travel, the Nega Bands, to open portals from one place to another and one of the Kree managed to use a Nega Band to get out of Earth and back to Hala before Hive killed him, but another Nega Band was left behind on the arm of one of the dead Kree (the one we see in *Ms. Marvel* that her great-grandmother finds).\n\n>\\[Note: This is kinda messy, but it is the only way I can think of to tie in the seemingly Kree origin of the bangles to Kamala being a mutant and merge the mutants and inhumans into 1 thing, which I feel is what they're going for considering the similarities between the 2 groups or at least the similarities between the mutants and the nuhumans\\]\n\nOne of the seemingly \"failed\" experiments of the Kree was a baby who didn\u2019t exhibit any powers even after their experiments, but that\u2019s because, the X-gene is naturally non-expressible before a person reaches their teenage years, and even the Kree enhancer could not change that, something the Kree didn\u2019t know. Thus, they dumped the baby in the deserts of Egypt, but that baby was En Saba Nur and would become one of the first mutants, Apocalypse.\n\nDuring that time, Kang had just arrived in Ancient Egypt himself and had assumed the identity of Rama-Tut, a Pharaoh. During one of his excursions in Asia, he found the Nega Band left behind by the Kree. He managed to reverse engineer it and create 10 new, more powerful versions of it, the 10 Rings. \n\nApocalypse grew up and decided to start a revolution against Rama-Tut. Rama-Tut used the Rings to try and kill Apocalypse, but the energy from the rings only made him stronger. He barricaded himself inside his castle, away from Apocalypse, and studied the Nega Band more. \n\nRama-Tut realised that the Nega Band, and thus the Ten Rings that he had created, were running on anti-matter, which, as he soon realized, had similar properties to Quantum Energy, coming from the Quantum Realm, the very place he was using to travel through time. He went back down there and in his exploration of the Realm, he found the Nexus of All Realities, the centre of the Multiverse itself, where the Watcher resides and oversees the Multiverse.\n\nThere, he found the Quantum Bands, the objects that the Kree had modelled their Nega Bands after in the first place. The Quantum Bands and the Nega Bands are very powerful artefacts that can open portals in space-time, but the Quantum Bands cannot be taken outside of the Quantum Realm because their Quantum Energy needs to be replenished constantly. That's why the Kree made the Nega Bands and used Anti-Matter as a replacement.\n\nRama-Tut, standing in the Nexus, managed to see all the possible futures and all of his variants. This Kang was one of the first variants to have travelled in time and while he had already met up with some of his other variants, they hadn\u2019t formed their council and didn\u2019t have any kind of shared goal just yet.\n\nBut Rama, seeing everything that will happen, put certain events in motion in order to ensure he and his variants that would ally with him in the future, would come out on top in the forthcoming, unavoidable Multiversal war. \n\n1. He put the Nega Band back where he found it on the dead Kree\u2019s hand.\n2. He left the Rings there too and installed a beacon that would be activated when a descendant of Ta-Lo would put the rings on (knowing that would be Shang-Chi a few thousand years later).\n3. He went to Mount Wundagore and transcribed Chthon\u2019s wall writings in a book, adding some of his own lies in there which would drive Wanda to further insanity and destabilize the Multiverse.\n4. He banished most of the people who had the X-Gene in the Negative Zone, the dimension where the anti-matter from the Nega Bands was actually taken from (in an attempt to recreate the effects of Quantum Energy of the Quantum Bands)\n5. He found the Time Stone and hid it in the Himalayas, were Agamotto would find it a few hundred years later and studying it would teach him the mystic arts and make him the first sorcerer on Earth.\n\nWenwu found the Ten Rings in the temple where the Kree had died, but never found the bangle that had been buried underground by that point. Later, Shang-Chi got those rings and due to his connection to Ta-Lo, Rama-Tut's beacon started beeping.\n\nThe mutants that had been sent to the Negative Zone slowly made it their home there and adapted to their new dimension. They called the dimension the Noor Dimension and called each of their special powers their Noor, aka their \u201clight\u201d. They formed their own society and culture and didn\u2019t want to come back to Earth because their powers would dissipate if the anti-matter didn't enhance their X-gene, giving them their power. At some point, thousands of years later, some of them were banished back to Earth and some Muslims who saw them called them Djinn. The Djinn went searching for the Nega Band that they had heard legends about and believed would take them back home, which set in motion the events of Ms. Marvel.\n\n>\\[Note: Yes, Anti-Matter and Quantum Energy also bypass the Celestial silencer and enhance the expression of the X-gene. That's how Kamala's X-gene was activated by the Nega Band\\]\n\n And the rest is history, all leading to the MCU we have today. \n\nA lot of Quantum Energy will be released during the Incursions in Secret War and activate the genes of a bunch of mutants which will be dealt with in the next saga. Most mutants existing today only have the Celestial silencer and not the Kree enhancer that counters said silencer, thus their powers will be activated during Secret Wars. However, some (like Prof X, Wolverine and Magneto or the \"Inhumans\" we saw in AoS) are Hive's and Apocalypse's descendants and thus have had powers since they became teenagers. However, because they are very few, they have been hiding their powers from the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know this is kinda shoddy and messy at the moment, it's just some of my thoughts and a combination of theories and rumours floating around the past few years that I tried putting together into a somewhat coherent order as I was contemplating how all the different threads of this Saga can come together.\n\nBut what do you guys think about it as a general outline?","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678022448.0},{"title":"Do you think MCU fans have to be comic book readers too?","author":"Itsminimal_me","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11kw49i\/do_you_think_mcu_fans_have_to_be_comic_book\/","text":"I see a lot of comic book readers attacking MCU fans who haven't read the books...\n\nin your opinion,Is it necessary to be a comic fan to enjoy (or criticize) the movies?","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1678186533.0},{"title":"Could Janet Van Dyne have escapes the quantum realm herself?","author":"Gmanc2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11kpom5\/could_janet_van_dyne_have_escapes_the_quantum\/","text":">!If Janet Van Dyne had pim particles to size up, why didn\u2019t she use them in the quantum realm to escape?

I was isolated during my homeschool time, and since my father worked long days to keep our house-mortgage, my mother disabled, unemployed, working night teaching gigs, and frequent family dysfunction (including domestic violence) -- I felt quite socially and emotionally isolated & neglected as well. And I was teased by my peers about it once I joined public high school. And bullied about it by my narcissistic parents about it too.\n2. I believe she was forced by Ego to emotionally sooth his guilt when he would kill his children who did not inherit the Celestial gene (unlike Peter). So he exploited her emotional superpowers, while also socially isolating her. She had nowhere else to go when she was stolen from her home planet -- as she says in quote: I was \"orphaned on my homeworld\". In my personal case, I have hyperlexia and ADHD, and it helps me enjoy numbers and math. My mother treated it as a \"superpower\", and I would be the \"superpowered\" child who made it worth her pregnancy in her abusive, domestic *arranged* marriage. But yet continued to socially neglect me. I also felt like I had to manage my emotions (and often hide them) to do accommodate my parents' dysfunction, and as a result I've developed toxic people-pleasing behaviors.\n\nI personally try to look at Guardians of the Galaxy 2, *and* GOTG: Christmas Special together (instead of separate films) to track Mantis' development. And personally I can appreciate and admire the journey she is on. And when I saw her be badass even in GOTG 2 (against Ego), against Thanos in Infinity War (subduing his mind), and in the Christmas Special, I see her self-confidence just rising to the sky and I see it possible for me to achieve self-confidence in my identity--me as my own self (and not an extension of someone else!)--confidence in my developing social skills, and confidence hoping I can heal and become a well-adjusted human.\n\nI know that James Gunn has said GOTG 3 will most likely be the last film with the Guardians. But I really, really hope Marvel will make a solo film about Mantis, or a solo TV show about her. There's so much character and backstory that can be mined, and I'd like to see her character developed more.","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678059266.0},{"title":"Cast this movie with Earth\u2019s Mightiest Muppets","author":"FictionFantom","url":"https:\/\/i.redd.it\/gcz7niq10vla1.jpg","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677977311.0},{"title":"Mark Ruffalo chats the original Avengers: Infinity War ending on the ECCC 2023's Main Stage","author":"allaboutmecomic","url":"https:\/\/www.thepopverse.com\/eccc-2023-mark-ruffalo-panel-main-stage","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678047271.0},{"title":"Was anyone surprised when they announced dates for next two huge event movies?","author":"snakewaves","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11jt4bj\/was_anyone_surprised_when_they_announced_dates\/","text":"Frankly, i was expecting the Kang movies to come out sometime like a decade later after endgame at the minimum.

Think of Fox's Logan: The movie cost half of what Marvel spent for Ant-Man 3, and it therefore had to be a much more small-scale, personal story. But the movie still earned 600 million dollars (and was universally acclaimed!).\n\nDon't get me wrong, Marvel has mastered the Avengers-level blockbusters, but I think there is space for stories where the universe isn't at stake, stories without a CGI-fest.

The worst part is i've found out the actors will be in reboots of The Defenders Saga stuff so it's probably pointless watching this tripe. \n\nI knew it would be a hard slog, US style 13 or 20 episode series usually are, there's so much padding you could line a psychiatric hospital with it and have spares. \n\nThe MCU is a throwback to 80s light action films such as Indiana Jones, Big Trouble in Little China or Batman, people die but it's largely bloodless, people make love but there's a closing door then a cut. This is why I like the MCU and why it appeals to a broad audience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I will happily watch more visceral of course but it's usually justified or so over the top it's comedic (From Dusk Till Dawn and Drive Angry come to mind). I'm also sure the people who were 13 or 14 when Iron Man came out were ready for something more blood and guts orientated in 2015 but some of us are happy with the status quo. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Defenders Saga a bit too sex, drugs and blood heavy and it could be toned down a tad and still get the message across  or do you feel it's appropriately visceral and \"gritty\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally it'll be difficult but i'm going to attempt to stick with it, even if i'm on episode 3 and I feel nothing much has actually happened, even if it proves fruitless I can at least move on rather than wonder \"What if?\".","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678030484.0},{"title":"With production ramping up on Daredevil Born Again, I threw together a little cosplay to celebrate.

This fella is seemingly from a completely different universe, and was exiled by his variants to a place \"outside of space and time\" to stop his multiversal tomfoolery. This all leads us to believe that across EVERY universe, there is only ONE Quantum Realm. If this is true, oh man, it messes things up *big time*.\n\n\nTo explain why this makes a mess, let's look at the fact that the Sacred Timeline of the MCU (616) is dependent on a couple of interactions with the Quantum Realm in order for Thanos to be defeated.\nThese interactions are:\n\n- Janet Van Dyme being sent to the Quantum Realm\n\n- Darren Cross being sent to the Quantum Realm via suit sabotage, which was done by Scott ALSO going to the Quantum Realm\n\n- Janet communicating a signal or something like that to Scott during his time there, causing the plot to Ant Man and the Wasp\n\n- Janet being rescued, discovering that healing particles exist in the Quantum Realm, and sending Scott on a mission to retrieve more. Then, while Scott's balls deep in the healing particles, the whole Pym Crew gets snapped by Thanos.\n\n- And finally, Scott being rescued by a curious rodent, and using his newfound knowledge of the Quantum Realm's influence on time to time travel and initiate the plot of Endgame.\n\nIf there is only ONE Quantum Realm across the entire multiverse, which we have been led to believe...Then, because of the nature of the multiverse, there should be MULTIPLE Janets within the Quantum Realm, among MULTIPLE disfigured Darrens, and above all of them, MULTIPLE Scotts floating in the time voids.\n\n\nIt's possible we've seen one of the multiple other Janets in What If? The Janet who contracted the zombie virus and caused a zombie apocalypse. But despite Feige saying that What If? is canon to the MCU multiverse, I feel they made that show without that in mind (still loved it tho!)\n\n\nThat's the end of my rant.

I've watched everything in the MCU (minus a few of the Netflix shows), and that includes everything in Phase 4. I've actively defended the MCU throughout Phase 4 and I continue to do so. That being said, I'm lot more critical now than ever because even someone like me who is willing to accept that Marvel isn't perfect is getting tired of the tropes and how they've handled their last batch of films and tv shows.\n\n So my question is what exactly is hurting the MCU? Because for while it was easy to say that the problems people were having with the franchise were from the loud minority, as it was easy to point at the generally positive reviews and box office success of Phase 4 (even during Covid) to dispute those criticisms. Thor: L&T for instance has received generally average, leaning towards positive reviews, and made over 700 million dollars at the WW box office despite negative WOM online. But the same can't be said with Ant-Man: Quantumania. Negative reviews from critics, mixed reception among even the most die hard fans, and even though I personally enjoyed it, I can't lie and say part of me didn't want a better movie. \n\nSeeing the online discourse surrounding the MCU the past 2 years has been a headache as people try and clammer to come up with some logical reason as to why the public perspective toward the franchise has shifted to be so negative, even among its fan base. Trying to place blame on individual directors and writers, or even Feige or Disney itself. Using buzz phases like \"superhero fatigue\" and \"MCU is dying.\" I can't begin to explain how often I've seen people online talk about their falling out of love of the MCU and how it should have ended with Endgame.\n\nSo what's the problem? At least what do I think the main thing hurting the MCU is? Oversaturation? Bad VFX? Overstaying its welcome? \n\nNo, it's simply the bad writing. \n\nIf you look at the writers and producers of everything released post-Endgame, and everything that's coming up in the near future, you'll notice that the writers Marvel has hired have little to no experience. Jeff Loveness who wrote Quantumania and is set to write Avengers: KD has nothing of note to his name besides a few episodes of Rick and Morty, and Feige thought it was a good idea to hire him to helm not just the movie kicking off the fifth phase of the MCU and introducing the next big bad, but also the first Avengers movie we've had in 6 years by the time of its release? \n\nThe Marvels, Captain America: NWO, Blade, all of these projects are in the hands of people with few writing credits and the credits they do have are not that well received. Hell, the Fantastic Four reboot is being written by two guys whose only main writing credit is a 2013 comedy with negative-to-mixed reviews. The only 2 Marvel movies coming out that have writers of solid experience are Thunderbolts, whose writer worked on Thor: Ragnar\u00f6k and Godzilla vs Kong, and Deadpool 3, which is being written by the same writers as the first two. And none of this is taking the series into account.\n\nI get it, Marvel wants to take risk and experiment, getting people relatively new to the industry to write for them, but I just don't understand how Feige can look at someone like Jeff Loveness, who to his credits does do a fantastic job with Rick and Morty, and say \"Hey, you've never written a single movie before, here's this massive Avengers-crossover event.\" \n\nAlso, I'm fully aware of the \"But the writers of Thor: The Dark World wrote Infinity War and Endgame\" argument, but that's not really a valid argument because at least they had experience writing movies before writing Thor. \"But the Russo Brothers' only credits before joining the MCU were poorly-received comedies!\" Yes, but that was back with Marvel was arguably still in its infancy and only released 2-3 projects a year. In 2023, as a multi-billion dollar company, Marvel shouldn't be cheap with who it hires to tell its stories, especially if it's aiming to release up to 5 or 6 projects a year and spreading Feige thin. Because if Feige really is the creative mastermind behind the Infinity Saga, it's clear he can't keep up with the amount of projects Marvel's releasing and should be more selective in hiring experienced storytellers who are guaranteed to delivered quality work. \n\nIn conclusion, I love the MCU, so much so that I'm willing to stick with it throughout the growing pains it goes through in hopes that it can be better can capture that excitement that it once did. And in some regard, it has. No Way Home was simply amazing and the hype and excitement leading up to that was Infinity War-Endgame levels, that high comic book movie fans have been missing since the pandemic.  It's looking GOTG Vol.3 is also going to be something akin to that and I'm very much looking for to it. Beyond that however, I'm worried for Marvel's future. I am hopeful though, as recently news that they're focusing more on quality over quantity, even pushing back and delaying certain projects, gives me hope they're listening and learning.\n\nTDLR; Marvel's biggest problem is simply bad writing and putting too much faith in the hands of writers and storytellers with little to no experience. In other words, being cheap to compensate for the large output of content they have to release.","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1677969772.0},{"title":"'Daredevil: Born Again' NEEDS to nail the tone","author":"JamJamGaGa","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11h8tkq\/daredevil_born_again_needs_to_nail_the_tone\/","text":"Since Charlie Cox's Daredevil returned in 'Spider-Man: No Way Home', fans have been both excited and concerned about his future appearances in the MCU. Most people seemed to enjoy his role in 'She-Hulk' but there really wasn't a lot of room for them to screw it up. That show was intended to be more comedic and they made us aware of that months in advance so that the backlash wouldn't be too heavy. Most people seemed to realise that and just appreciate it for what it was.\n\nFor his own show, the bar is set WAY higher. This isn't a small role in someone else's movie or show. This is a brand new show that focuses on the man himself. It's the follow-up to what many consider to be the greatest Marvel show ever made and one of the greatest comic book adaptations of all time. People ADORE 'Daredevil' and one of the reasons why is because it's so different from what we normally get from the MCU. It doesn't interrupt dramatic moments with silly jokes that break all tension, it doesn't rely on overwhelming amounts of CGI, and it doesn't feature things that are clearly only there to setup the next 5 projects. It's a gritty, violent and extremely mature show. Something Marvel Studios is yet to give us.\n\nThe reason why I specifically mentioned the tone and not other aspects like casting, choreography, budget, etc. is because they've already proven they can nail all of those things. They've got Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio as the leads, they've already given us a gritty hallway fight, and the other shows have shown us how much money is being thrown into these productions. The one thing that's a big question mark is the tone.\n\nMy hope is that the new show will include less of this type of humour:\n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/11h8tkq\/video\/yiwam5fgbkla1\/player\n\n...and more of this type of humour: \n\nhttps:\/\/reddit.com\/link\/11h8tkq\/video\/m2hzj0dibkla1\/player\n\nI'm preparing for the worst but still hoping that they'll manage to not fuck it up.

Anyone who's played *The Avengers* know that this is not the case. (I'm aware games aren't live-action but the character is mostly CGI anyway). His design and characterisation in the game makes him frightening and grotesque. Design-wise, reducing the size of his head and increasing the amount of protruding weaponry makes him look less ridiculous, as it makes the head and limbs less prominent and makes him look more octopus-like, which gives him some familiarity. The head itself is also much more wrinkled and scarred, which makes him look more monstrous, and his expressions and the shadows under his eyes make him seem more sinister. As he is the main antagonist and not a comic relief character, he is shown to be a real threat through his actions and his voice and dialogue also feel threatening. Paired with his design, this means he is taken seriously by the heroes.\n\nNot all of these elements are necessary for a serious portrayal of M.O.D.O.K, and a serious portrayal of M.O.D.O.K isn't necessarily better than a non-serious one (I liked the animated show), but my point is that it could have been done. For the record, my only issue with M.O.D.O.K's design in Ant-Man and The Other One: Quantumania was his face, specifically the way it was just a normal face but enlarged and stretched (and I think that the CGI wasn't very good). Refer to this [fan-art](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11br7mv\/modok_redesign\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) as an example of how it could have looked. Everything else I really liked, especially the addition of the mask, which was actually intimidating, unlike his face. Also, my main issue with him in terms of writing was that the motivation of his betrayal of Kang (\"Don't be a dick\") didn't make any sense and was played off just for laughs, as was his death, which shouldn't have even happened in the first place. I believe his betrayal should have stemmed from his growing disdain for Kang's treatment of him as a lesser being, something that is barely explored in the film, rather than a total and sudden turn to the good side. He could have also made a great recurring villain and been used to setup the introduction of AIM.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1677877210.0},{"title":"The Disney+ shows have been more enjoyable than the post End Game movies.","author":"WEEGEMAN","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11gpc5f\/the_disney_shows_have_been_more_enjoyable_than\/","text":"Anyone else feel the same?\n\nThey\u2019re fresher to me.

Because of Endgame and Loki, we know that time travel also constitutes interacting with the Multiverse.\n\nEveryone who's messed with the Timeline\/Multiverse in the Cinematic Universes (FOX-Men, MCU, SONYverse) should not only be targets of the Kangs, there's also precedent for them fighting in the comics as well!\n\n- X-Men; created a branched timeline and\/or rewrote their own timeline (?) in Days of Future Past. Fought Kang in the shockingly canon crossover with Star Trek.\n\n- Spider-Man; both Tobey and Andrew were brought into No Way Home, while Miles, Gwen and Dadbod Peter interacted with the Multiverse in Spider-Verse. Peter Parker fought Kang as early as Avengers #11.\n\n- Deadpool\/Cable; while I don't believe Deadpool ever fought Kang, Cable fought Rama-Tut in Cable #57.\n\n- Legion; while I don't believe Legion has ever faced Kang in the comics, his show visited several alternate realities.\n\nStarting with characters\/franchises in the MCU:\n\n- The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. traveled to alternate realities in Seasons 4 (the Framework), 5 (the Destroyed Earth) and 7 (the History Altered by the Chronicoms). On Earth-16112, they prevented Scarlet Centurion from murdering Odin, which would've caused the Asgardians to wipe out all life on Earth.\n\n- The Runaways; a Chase Stein from 2028 and the remaining Runaways from 2021 traveled back to 2018 to successfully prevent Morgan le Fay from murdering Gert Yorkes. The Runaways of Earth-2912 were actually formed into their reality's Young Avengers by Iron Lad, though him and Kang were killed by Ultron's son, Victorious, in an attempt to kill the Runaways. (It's messy.)\n\n- The Avengers are Kang's main target throughout all of his schemes, and they famously played jump rope with the Multiverse in Endgame. Two characters that were not involved with the Time Heist but have a massive history with Immortus are Scarlet Witch and Mantis. He wanted to impregnate both of them (and Agatha Harkness, who was an old woman at the time) in order to father the Celestial Messiah. Spoiler alert, the mother, the Celestial Madonna, would end up being Mantis. Her husband? Jack Duquesne from Hawkeye.\n\n- Loki; while I don't believe the two were ever in conflict with one another, they were teammates on the Cosmic Avengers. Along with Scott Lang, and Kamala Khan.\n\n- Captain Carter; traveled the Multiverse in the What If season finale. Has never battled Kang in the comics, but Peggy Carter went head-to-head with Kang, even using Steve's shield against him, in an episode of the Avengers Assemble cartoon.\n\n- She-Hulk; broke the fourth wall and traveled to K.E.V.I.N.'s reality. She-Hulk has fought Kang as an Avenger.\n\n- Doctor Strange; effed around and found out in Multiverse of Madness, though I don't think he's fought Kang in the comics.\n\n- Ms. Marvel; Kamala got herself involved in a time loop where she saves her grandmother with her bangle. Aside from being teammates with Kang on the Cosmic Avengers, the two were fused by Gamora (using the Soul Stone) into Kamala Kang, with the power to embiggen through time. Because that makes sense. Kang also once stranded Kamala in the early days of the Avengers, and in that same conflict it was revealed by a cosmically empowered future Kamala that the two briefly dated in her 30's and that's why he hates her.\n\n- And now in Quantumania, we have Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne. In the comics *Nadia* Van Dyne fought Kang during the Kang War in the Avengers comics of 2016. Kamala Khan was also present. Iron Lad actually saved Scott Lang from being killed by Scarlet Witch during the Avengers Disassembled event.\n\nIron Lad also dated Cassie Lang, and founded the Young Avengers which would later come to include the Multiversal traveler, America Chavez.\n\nThe only people to have traveled the Multiverse in the MCU who have never interacted with Kang in the comics (as far as I'm aware) are Cloak & Dagger, as Dagger was sent through 4 alternate realities by the evil Voudon loa (voodoo god) D'Spayre, and both Cloak & Dagger were sent to a 5th alternate reality by the loa Papa Legba.\n\nIf Kang Dynasty truly sees the Kangs going after *EVERYONE* who's messed with time\/the multiverse (which let's be honest, likely won't happen), we will see the biggest crossover ever seen in Marvel. Because even the comics can only fit so many characters in a panel, and this would encompass far more characters than Endgame.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677725725.0},{"title":"Let's talk about the big second weekend drop-off for Quantumania (no spoilers), how many times do you typically see a Marvel movie in theaters?","author":"omart3","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/marvelstudios\/comments\/11h4fm0\/lets_talk_about_the_big_second_weekend_dropoff\/","text":"The discussion about this movie having the biggest second weekend drop-off has gotten me curious about our movie watching habits.

Tie-ins to the movies were smart, but it's at the point where the show is standing on it's own.\n\n3. **Nick Fury** (Previous: 3rd)- Fury takes the year off, but I don't think he's going to lose his third spot for a quick minute.\n\n4. **Steve Rogers \/ Captain America** (Previous: 4th)- Cap closes the gap on the top 3 though. He's officially threatening to be the first to jump into the top 3 since I started doing this, and I suspect he will.\n\n5. **Natasha Romanoff \/ Black Widow** (Previous: 6th)- While not having her movie yet, Nat has one of the best arcs that runs through all of her appearances across the Iron Man, Avengers and Captain America franchises. \n\n6. **Thor Odinson** (Previous: 5th)- Thor drops a little for *mostly* taking the year off, he did make a quick appearances in the One-Shot *Team Thor* which we should not forget lol.\n\n7. **James Rhodes \/ War Machine** (Previous: 9th)- Being consistent is the name of the game here, and nobody has been more consistent than Rhodey after a slightly rocky start. Can't say he's had much of an arc, but that's not the criteria here.\n\n8. **Agent Peggy Carter** (Previous: 8th)- Having your own show really helps maintain your relevance, but this is the year we said goodbye to Margaret Carter (except for time travel), so expect her to drop as we go forward. \n\n9. **Bruce Banner \/ Hulk** (Previous: 7th)- Not much to say about Hulk here. He has coffee with Thor. They both have better adventures next year. \n\n10. **Howard Stark** (Previous: 15th)- Howard Stark is the character we can't get away from. He's in *Agent Carter* Season 2, and has a quick AI\/Death Cameo in *Captain America: Civil War*. I would have never thought he would climb this high, but it's a testament to how pervasive he is. \n\n11. **Clint Barton \/ Hawkeye** (Previous:16th) - Finally! Our boy feels like he belongs amongst his peers. A joke with BP aside, Clint is now one of the most established characters. \n\n12. **Pepper Potts** (Previous: 10th)- An ominous couple of mentions in *Civil War* give context as to why we haven't seen Pepper, She'll be back though! So don't expect her to fall too far.\n\n13. **Erik Selvig** (Previous: 11th)- I don't think we see him again? With the move to three movies a year, I think it's only a matter of time before he falls.\n\n14. **Maria Hill** (Previous: 12th)- Like Fury, she took the year off, so like her contemporaries, she drops two spots. \n\n15. **Sam Wilson \/ Falcon** (Previous: 18th)- Another great supporting role for Sam. He's the newest introduced character on the list to be this high, and you can see why. He's incredibly likeable.\n\n16. **Jasper Sitwell** (Previous: 13th)- Another early Icarus character who flew to close to the top. His early contributions were invaluable, but now we will see him slowly fall off.\n\n17. **Loki Laufeyson** (Previous: 14th)- The bleeding stops here for Loki though, we should see him rise again after this list.\n\n18. **Bucky Barnes \/ Winter Soldier** (Previous: NR)- Bucky was on the 2014 list, but fell off last time, we'll see how much staying power he has moving forward. \n\n19. **Daisy Johnson \/ Quake, Melinda May, Grant Ward \/ Hive, Jemma Simmons, Leo Fitz** (Previous: NR)- I'm gonna cheat a bit and give the last two spots to the five longstanding cast members of *Agents of SHIELD*. I refuse to pick between them all, and I really wanna acknowledge the show and it's importance to this point. The accomplishments are amazing, and they are the engine alongside Coulson. \n\nGive me a few days on the 2017 edition. As the universe expands, this becomes more time consuming. Hopefully by middle of next week I'll have it up. Everyone have a great weekend!","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1677798455.0},{"title":"Since y\u2019all liked the last one so much \ud83d\ude02 another take on live action MODOK.

We've spent two movies hearing about Janet van Dyne and her 30 years in the QR but yet we see so little of her or find out so little of her history once she returns.  Also, there's the easter egg of the silhouette of the city inside the QR.  And although we see a BIT of the QR, it's still basically just a big tease up until this point.  And Cassie has all her comments about wanting to be a hero like her dad.\n\nBasically, if you had asked me prior to Quantumania what a satisfying payoff to all the remaining setup from Chapter 2  would be in order to round out the trilogy in a satisfying matter, it would be this list:\n\n* Finally give us JANET as a fully-featured character in her own right\n* Also, tell us what Janet was up to for those 30 years in the QR\n* Show us what was up with that city\/cities\/etc. in the QR\n* Let's see older Cassie take on that heroic identity she's obviously destined for\n* BONUS: Show us what happened to Darren Cross when he shrunk down to subatomic range (eg. when it happened to Scott, he went to the QR-- why wouldn't the same thing have happened to Darren?)\n\nAnd point by point, this is exactly what the movie gave us.  After only dipping our toes increasingly into the QR for the first two movies, we FINALLY got to fully dive in.  That's what I most wanted to see in an Ant-Man 3, and that's EXACTLY what they delivered!  Peyton Reed and the Marvel team did a GREAT job of building a satisfying trilogy which feels like a true cohesive story.\n\n(Think of it this way: If they had given us a third Ant-Man movie that was just another small-scale, San Francisco-based heist film, I think we all would have felt that NOT ever getting a grand QR adventure was just such a waste of potential and setup, like... why did they even bother teasing us about it so much for the first two movies if it hadn't been the plan to REALLY GO there, all along?)\n\nWhat ELSE would a satisfying trilogy conclusion for Ant-Man be, other than having an epic adventure in the QR itself?  (Kind of like in the original Star Wars trilogy... In Ep 4, you hear the emperor get mentioned by name only, then in Ep. 5, you see him in hologram form, then... for the conclusion in Ep. 6 you spend an entire movie in his friggin' throne room where he's the fully-realized antagonist of the movie whose defeat is the climax of the entire trilogy.  For a trilogy about rebels fighting an evil empire, of course the conclusion would feature the Emperor's downfall.  For a trilogy of shrinking, science-based adventurers dangerously interacting with the vast mystery of the QR with increasingly perilous results... of course the conclusion would revolve around an intense and full exploration of that place.\n\nYou may argue of course, that you didn't like the plot, the dialogue, the character development (or lack thereof) etc..\n\nBut in terms of theme, scope and general premise, this movie was right on the money as a cohesive trilogy capper-- taken collectively as a trilogy the Ant-Man films are WAY more cohesive than say, the three Iron Man or three Thor movies taken collectively.  (Captain America worked similarly well as a trilogy that consistently developed a theme and characters.)","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677734063.0},{"title":"Can someone please clarify which comes out first?","author":"Loud_Power_8197","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/11gs2v4","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.42,"created_utc":1677820338.0},{"title":"Stan Lee once said:","author":"Didimoni2020","url":"https:\/\/v.redd.it\/cqbfp0qql3la1","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677663645.0},{"title":"Anybody else notice \"He Who Remains\" in the Marvel Studios intro?

The thing is that even Marvel acknowledged that Ant-Man is out of league compared to Kang. I know that not all people can be satisfied by a movie, and that the movie can not change now, but it is just my take on the film and I am looking forward on the future of the MCU.\n\n**Story**\n\nIt takes place one year after *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\nThe film opens with a montage of Scott Lang having fun and being interviewed by reporters about his new book, for saving the world, and his opinion on the new Captain America, Sam Wilson. In this montage we see fans that are excited to meet Scott, and among them is Kamala Khan (before she became Ms. Marvel). After the montage ends we see Scott's other side, the father one. He tries to spend as much time with his daughter, Cassie. We learn that at the time that Scott was missing, Cassie studied the Quantum Realm, but could not really understand it (this would be implied via a joke obviously). Scott feels guilty about him being absent from Cassie's life for so long and has insomnia, as he has nightmares of losing her again.\n\nWe then cut to a scene where Scott, Hope and Cassie visit Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne at there house. Hank confronts Scott for his extensive presence on the news, and that he should focus more on fighting crime, like the other Avengers have done. Then, Cassie tells everyone to follow her to the lab, where she has created sometype of a portal to the Quantum Realm. She wanted to be a surprise for her dad's birthday. Scott jokes about it, but Janet quickly rushes to shout it done, but accidentally activates it, dragging everyone in the room into the Quantum Realm, except Hank who was close to the exit. Scott and Cassie land in an area where they are captured by MODOK's forces. Janet and Hope meet a resistance group.\n\nScott is taken to Kang the Conqueror. Kang tells to Scott that MODOK told him about him. Scott says that he is an Avenger, but an unshocked Kang asks if he has killed him before. Then, asks him if he is Iron Man, with Scott saying that people are always confusing them. Kang says that at first he thought he was Mister Fantastic, with Scott saying that he is always fantastic. Kang tells to Scott that he wants to shrink down a Quantum Core. In return he would give Scott what he deeply wants: time. Scott agress and with his daughter they leave to the mission. Janet and Hope have a mother-daughter discussion, and Janet reveals to her what happened when she was stuck in the Quantum Realm, all about Kang and his backstory, and they decide to go and confront him on their own.\n\nJanet and Hope get inside Kang's palace, but are caught by MODOK. Scott successfully retrieves the Core. He takes it back to Kang, but he reveals to him that the Cassie he was taking to is not her but a skrull. In order to have Cassie and Hope back he must give him the Pym particles in his suit to make the Core work (Hope's suit was damaged and the particles disappeared). Kang then kills Janet infront of everyone, and says that this will be their fate. Cassie advises him against doing so, but Scott agrees. Kang uses the particles to power his Core. But, Scott was hiding an emergency collection of Pym particles, and uses them to free Hope and Cassie, and fight Kang. Scott, Hope and Cassie battle with Kang, and then the resistance appears, led by MODOK, who had betrayed Kang in order to take his place. A furious Kang attacks the resistance, with Hope managing to open a portal to their world via the Core. Scott tells them to leave as he fights off Kang, but Hope stays and Cassie is forced to leave. Instead of leaving with her, Scott and Hope take the Pym particles, and fight Kang, disabling the Core. Kang kills both, and retrieves some particles, which are enough to open a portal. Kang with his army flee the Quantum Realm, destroying what is left behind. Due to the small number of Pym particles, the wormhole is unstable, with Kang and his army arriving on a different Earth, Earth-838. Back on our world, Hank confirms that Scott and Hope are dead, as he lost their signature. He talks to a crying Cassie, and implies that they can still avenge them.\n\nMid-credits scene: Hank is in a SWORD building, and meets with Bruce Banner \/ Hulk and James Rhodes \/ War Machine. He tells them that they must reassemble (implaying the Avengers team).\n\nPost-credit scene: Loki and Mobius meet Victor Timely.","upvote_ratio":0.18,"created_utc":1677853127.0},{"title":"Not too long ago, I asked Ginacarlo if he'd be interested in playing Charles Xaiver.

Good special effects\n2. A dozen or so good one-liners\n3. A sense of dread for the upcoming phase\n\nI kind of got all three but was left going, \"meh.\" So why?\n\nThese are the things that I think rubbed me the wrong way, in no particular order:\n\n* Everything felt really small (no pun intended) - So many scenes were a great big, digital matte painting in the background; a handful of extras in the middle-distance; and 2-3 characters in the foreground. After a while it just felt like a stage play.\n* Lots of new characters introduced with little or no development - Hell, the \"I like holes\" guy was probably the most deeply explored character outside of the main cast and Bill Murray's character.\n* Stakes were super-low - We know Kang is coming, but we also know that he's got lots of variants, so whether or not he escapes is unimportant to the threat he poses. Given that, we're concerned about what? It seems clear he won't kill anyone right up until they actively start destroying his plans.\n* Attempts at heartwarming moments fell flat for me - I'm really sick of the \"I'm stuck in an impossible situation, but I think of my love for [spouse, parent, child] and suddenly the impossible is possible,\" trope.\n* The movie kept going \"secret cameo mode!!!\" - Every time someone was going to get introduced, we'd get the secret cameo cam.

Jonathan Majors is excellent (though I wish he'd been more \"on\" as Kang... this felt like a directorial decision more than Majors' limitations). Some of the CG was awesome.

We can even have another traditional Luis story recounting as he tries to explain to the team what he had to go through the get what they asked for.\n\n Luis finally acquires and assembles the parts required to open the portal just as they are fighting Kang, who attempts to jump through.

The team beats Kang narrowly as occurs in the film and they ask Luis to open the portal again, who complains that they need to make up their minds.

What i can say though is that it lacks a certain punch when it comes to resolving its climax, relying on gimmicks and last minute plot twists.\n\nI do have to wonder what could be the main difference between the MCU before infinity war and after infinity war when it comes to its writing that it misses more than it hits.
