The same can be said for someone who plays guitar, they are only interested in your skill level. \n\nOn the other hand, telling people you volunteer for social work seems to have more of a positive impact on people's perceptions straight up, rather than how good you are at it. Being good is just icing on the cake. \n\nSo what do you think influences people more?",

Climate change, resources running out, overpopulation, and things of that sort come together to make me worried that the world is only going to get worse, and at the extreme end of things, that some sort of collapse will happen in my lifetime. I'm aware that bad news sells and tends to drown out the good, which is part of why these worries are bothering me.\n\nThis is less a question about which fears are valid and which are not (though there's certainly room for discussion), and more a question about how to keep it all from dragging me down. I'm generally a pretty happy person, but these sorts of thoughts have been hanging around in the back of my mind lately and I'd rather they didn't, because they make it hard for me to continue being a pretty happy person. How do you keep a balance between being informed about the world and being overwhelmed and depressed by all the bad in the world?",

There have been studies that confirm this notion, but also reject it as well.\n\nLet's say, for the sake of this thread, that there is no evidence of a causal link between playing violent video games and violent or aggressive behavior from those who play violent video games.\n\nAre we then able to reconcile the notion that playing sexist video games does not lead to being sexist in real life?\n\nAre the two comparable or are those arguments too different to be compared? What are your thoughts and opinions?\n\nAs a side note, I'd like to be forthcoming about my personal biases. I think some people do not have the intellectual or emotional capacity to discern fantasy violence/sexism in entertainment media from reality. I also think there are plenty of people who can discern the difference. I feel like it's not a black and white, all or nothing issue.",

After training is done for the new service member, form units of them and send them back to their country to fight and reclaim it for themselves. They would get paid the same wage as our fighting soldiers, their dependents would get the same benefits as our soldiers dependents. They can then fight for their country and freedoms, just as our founders had to do for ours. Our founders did not get freedom handed to them, they had to fight for it. So should any man that occupies that same position. \n\nOnce their home country is liberated and secure, we will send the families back at no cost. We can then show the newly free, if they ask it of us, how to setup and run an elected, representative government. We will also have helped them form their own military, with proper training like our boys get. Our men and women should not have to fight and die for someone else's country. If the refugees that are able, will not stand up for their own country and freedoms, then my brothers and sisters blood and tears should not pay for their country and freedoms either. If they are not willing to agree to these conditions, then they have to find another country to fight their war.\n\ntl;dr\n refugees get special visa, fighting age men get trained and then go back and fix home country, then refugees go home.\nEDIT: Any country could do this, I just used the United States as an example.",
