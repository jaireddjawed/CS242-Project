In my mind he's like the extreme polar opposite of a socially anxious person, in a good way, he always has something interesting to talk about, opposite of boring, even if the situation and people around him are totally dull he somehow knows how to make it funny and light, dude's a genius when it comes to social skills, seeing the remotes that he does, he can bond and create chemistry with any kind of person of any different culture or age, i can't even do that with people I've known for my entire life, it's crazy how fast he can come up with a joke, even though i watch him a lot i still can't learn from him or even just copy and apply those skills irl, in my mind that's what the peak of a socially skilled and adept guy looks like.",

When I started the year I felt so much better since I’d joined a new school for junior and senior year after spending almost a decade with no proper friends at my old school. I had like 5-6 friends I could talk to but about a week ago I realized I didn’t even really like them and that they were pretty much fake. The only friend I’ve got now is a 12th grader, and she leaves in about a month so I don’t even know who I can talk to anymore.\n\nHalf the grade is people I would rather not associate myself with (annoying, racist, homophobic and whatnot) and the majority of the other half have known each other since they were young so I never had any scope of being close to them. (I usually like to have 2-3 very close friends that I can rely on rather than like 20). I’ve been pretty much lonely for majority of my schooling so I don’t really know if I’m the issue or if it’ll get better in college. I do realize that it’s just one more year and I’ll never have to worry about this place but I just want to know if there’s anything I can do to make this last year at least a bit more tolerable. Any advice?",

As i was explaining things he asked me if i had an eraser(he was drawing something) i got annoyed, i looked at him and said i was never gonna tell him about anything again. He told me he was actually listening and just had nothing to say. Then i explained him he always does this. When i am talking about something personal he always changes the topic or says something about himself before i can finish my story or thoughts. I said if there is something he doesn't want to talk about he should tell me and we can leave it at that. He got upset and left without us. Our other friend run up to him. He told her that he got too upset and didn't want to say something hurtful. I genuinely think this is something we can talk about and resolve but we can't do that if he just leaves. idk what to do. I'm waiting for him to reach out.\n\nPreviously we had an argument about me not telling him anything. He felt like i was putting some distance between us because i was going through some stuff and said i didn't want to talk about it. I told him i didn't want to relive stuff by talking about it and it wasn't about him. We solved it like that. I started to tell him more stuff because of this and i just don't understand why he is acting like this when he wants me to talk more to him.",

I might not make a big deal of it but I sometimes wonder if maybe some other women my age do.\n\n2) Lifestyle difference: I'm a childless apartment rat and I kind of prefer it that way. It's not exactly a popular lifestyle choice among my same-aged peers though. They've all had husbands or kids or owned homes or started businesses. Which is frustrating. They're commitments tie up their time. And even if some shred of time is free, they tend to do their coffee dates with other people from the \"moms with mortgages\" set. And it's frustrating because I feel so behind. I've never even kissed a guy yet.\n\n3) High functioning autism: There is a social blindness problem to be honest. Holding conversations can be difficult though I do my level best to be friendly and relatable. \n\nI have no idea what I'm doing wrong. These are just my best guesses and speculations.

I was there with my dog throwing around a ball and a woman around my age came up to me saying she thought my dog was really cute and friendly. I thanked her and we talked about our dogs for a few minutes. I then say something like “yeah I actually wanted a dog who doesn’t shed but my fiancée wanted a larger dog. So we agreed on getting this 40lb golden doodle”. And after bringing up my fiancée it almost always makes her seem weird directly after. \n\nSo should I stop bringing up my fiancée mid conversation with strangers? Unless they start making moves?",

I barley talk to anyone at work either and it absolutely sucks. I would love to have some amazing conversations with people at work but I’m so blank minded!!

        "text": "I'm (22F) a university student in a country in which people tend to be more reserved and not as talkative in public. I grew up here so I have a tendency to be very shy with strangers and pretty much never attempt to start a conversation with someone I don't know. As a result I find it hard to make new friends. Today during a lecture I sat next to a guy I never saw or spoke to before who is from a different study course. After the lectures were over he suddenly asked me if i take chemistry to which I said no. He asked a bunch of questions about if my course and what subjects I have and there was a bit of back and forth between us, during which my heart was pounding pretty hard because like I said, I am uncomfortable when talking to someone I don't know. So we walked up the stairs among many other students and I just couldn't think of anything to say or ask, so there was just and awkward silence. After we got out he walked to a nearby group of friends and I kinda stood around pretending to be on my phone. I did notice he was looking at me while he was standing with his group of friends, but I just couldn't bring myself to go to them. There's nothing more intimidating to me than the thought of approaching a group of strangers. So after a few moments I slowly walked out and that was it.\n\nI feel like im just a broken human being. Any other person would have been able to think of things to say and keep the conversation and make a friend. Why do I always get so nervous and wish to get out of interactions and then immediately regret it after? If someone you approached were to react like me, would you think they were a weirdo? I don't know what to do to improve anymore.",

I am currently on the way of getting an autism assessment. \n\nI've been feeling very stuck in life for a few years. Since covid I wfh with my shitty job which does not value me. Ive applied for a new role which has realistic opportunity for me to receive the role for numerous reasons. I am pretty confident with that. However the role would require me to be more sociable with people and liason. I'd have to do a lot of telephone work and that's something which makes me freeze.\n\nI'm looking for any advice you could give me or any similar experiences you may have. Thanks!",

During these 4 days, we were always together. There are some problems with this: they are quite wealthy, and I am not (this is my first job and my first year working); they drink A LOT and I don't even sip alcohol; they make fun of everyone, and I have no idea how to engage in these conversations; they are absolute assholes. Ok... Now the main issue is the money. No one kept tabs on how much each spent (but I know for a fact they all wasted way more than me. I skipped several bars and restaurants because I couldn't keep up with them). And they want to pay things in equal parts!!! What?!? I am stupified. How do I even say \"No way, are you crazy?\" in a polite manner? My only way to contact them is by email now and I have no idea what to write. I feel like I can't pay rent these next months given how much these guys spent. I'm desperate. What should I even say to people who seem to lack any form of empathy? How can I be assertive in just 1 email and make it clear I won't pay for them? They drank a lot and alcohol was extremely expensive there.\n\nPlease, any help is much appreciated.",

        "text": "Initially, I learned how to smile to improve the quality of my photos. As I grew older and began learning how to present myself in a better light as a result of my career, I discovered that smiling also improves your likability and creates a better first impression, as most people form this in the first few seconds of meeting. To incorporate the characteristics of a genuine smile, follow these steps:\n\n1. Relax your face and take a deep breath. 🫁\n2. Think of something that makes you happy. ☺️\n3. Lift your cheeks and part your lips slightly. 😀\n4. Squint your eyes a little. 😆\n\nPractice in front of a mirror and use it in social situations, starting with casual/less formal or lower-stakes situations before moving on to more important ones.\nPro tip: Practice moving your lips to the same position (find your sweet spot) every time to ensure a consistent quality of smile. When you know you look your best in the first few seconds, it automatically boosts your confidence.\nBonus points if you keep a happy image in mind each time.\nNote: If the first impression is important, such as in an interview, client meeting, or when approaching someone for the first time, check (and adjust if needed) your smile using your selfie camera. Then, shrug off any nervousness, knowing that you did your best for that interaction.\n\nThank you for listening.",

But it’s like the follow up times of of not quite sure how to interact with them because I don’t know if they like me or not, even if they show signs that they do you like me. Like it gets weird like to the point where the other day I actively decided not to sit next to a guy I like and occasionally text to him at a meeting, I’m an AA, because subconsciously I realized I wanted to make sure that the seat was open because me sitting there would be a burden to him when there are other more interesting people he can be around potentially. Which I know is crazy. But also it doesn’t feel that way in the moment\n\nAnyway I saw a post on here saying assume everyone likes you and I thought that’s a good idea but how do I remember to do that how do I implicate that? How do I deal with this in general, does anyone have any tips?Thank you!",

All throughout high school, I’ve had a very small social circle - two very close friends and some that I’d socialize with every now and then. By graduation, come to find out those two very close “friends” weren’t really genuine friends - they’ve talked behind my back, ruined opportunities for me and ruined a very loving relationship I’ve had (we are back together now that we’ve dropped them as friends) and the very little people I’ve socialized with I’ve lost contact with. Ever since, it’s been really difficult for me to make friends, and when I do, they never really seem to want to stay in contact with me or really make an effort to actually have a genuine friendship with me.

I'd like to be more social but... Don't know what to say. I work with a rambler. She will talk your ear off even at the expense of production. I'm considering adopting a piece of her personality. A lot of times she'll repeat herself or talk about the most simple and obvious things but a lot of people come to talk to her throughout the day. \n\nI don't want to be annoying but I'd like to talk to more people. I don't have many friends and I think people think I'm weird sometimes.",

Both have been friends for years, but his extroverted friend doesnt seems to be with him at recess and I don't really know if its his choice because he enjoys his own company. With that in mind, I want to be his friend because I think he is a really peaceful person but I dont know how to approach him and I don't want to overwhelm him.\nI dont know if he is just shy or desinterested haha, 3 days I got courage and ate with him and asked about a game that he likes a lot, and he told me a little about it. We doesnt seem to have a lot in common but I believe that if I keep being by his side for a few months he will open up more. \nWhat other things could I try to do? How do I know if he is uncomfortable or does not want my company? Those questions go through my mind, I appreciate the feedback!!",

I have no problem talking about academics with classmates or work with colleagues during internships, and I can hang out well with close friends. However, when I go to networking events, coffee/dinner chat or meet up with random people, my true colors of being a social retard are uncovered. Sometimes I can even feel that I am making the conversation embarassing by not knowing what to say and can only reply with some brief comments like \"cool\", \"That's awesome\" or \"Thanks for sharing your story\". To add insult to injury, I am ESL (English as second language) student and I'm not very clear in oral speaking.\n\nAnyone has/had similar struggles? What advice could you kindly share to get better at socializing? Thank you!",

My biggest problems were intense fear of saying or doing something wrong or saying something stupid in a social situation and this led to a lot of avoidance and isolation.\n\nI’m curious to hear\n1. What would you say is your biggest problem when it comes to social interaction\n2. Examples of when this problem has effected your Life. \n3. What have you done to try and solve this.

        "text": "I have many many issues with this friend. He’s extremely cold and probably a sociopath, at least towards me. I always feel insecure about our friendship. It’s too complex to explain it all. But the truth is that we talk on the phone for hours every day, for years, so I want to think that he doesn’t *hate* me. However it’s like he’s with me out of obligation and as soon as we’re not together again or hang up the phone he just ignores me, like he’s tired of me.\n\nHe always takes forever to reply, hours, sometimes he’ll just never open my messages. But he’s often online and I can see how he connect several times an hour and my message sits there unopened, and I just can’t understand it. Who is he talking to? Why is he ignoring my message? Does he see it and think “how annoying”?\n\nFor example today he took the day off work to be with me. I live very far away and every now and then come all the way just to see him for a few days. Even though him taking the time to be with me would be considered the bare minimum, I still decided to send him a message to tell him I appreciate it. This was 6 hours ago and he never opened it. Even when just a 3 word reply would suffice. But he’s been on messenger, Instagram, Snapchat, so he’s clearly talking to others, just not me.\n\nSometimes when we’re together and he’s on his phone I can see him opening messenger or Snapchat and see that my message is the only unopened one, and I just don’t understand why.\n\nLike I said this is just one of the many things he does that make me feel this way. I’m very sensitive and he’s extremely apathetic. He often talks about how he has no feelings, and often he can be very cruel and uncaring (he probably has some social disability and really needs therapy). But he’s not like this with everyone, from what I’ve seen. I’m his only really close friend so I have nothing to compare it to. If he connects every 20 minutes he’s clearly talking to other people, but why does he ignore my texts? I’m sure he doesn’t hate me because no one talks to a friend who lives out of town every day for years out of obligation but this sort of behavior makes me feel very insecure and overthink, and I’ve cried myself to sleep more than once because of behavior like this.",

        "text": "Just getting my thoughts out here since I'm feeling it today.\n\nThe path I am on is one of discovering my individuality and my own power. It is something that I'm not used to and I often don't know how to relax. In fact I'm almost constantly hyper-vigilant.\n\nMy social anxiety has always been terrible. I ascribe it to childhood neglect, violence, school bullying and existential chaos which ruled my life, particularly in my 20's.\n\nI am almost 37 years old and I have decided to start really focusing on being comfortable within myself. A catalyst for this is two work colleagues being rather exclusionary of me as well as discovering one of them simply not liking me at all. Another catalyst is that I want to go into the teaching profession. In order for me to be a successful teacher, I have to be benevolent authority figure and for that I need to be confident in myself and my abilities.\n\nIt devastated me to find out that some people are not keen me being there. I wanted to be liked by everyone, and found out that not everyone likes me. Bummer. \n\nHowever, I feel I need this experience. I need the pain and the discomfort so that I can use it as an opportunity to maturely stand my ground and assert my boundaries. \n\nAt this moment I am overwhelmed. I am worried that the physical anxiety would plunge me into a bit of a dissociative crisis. At the same time I am confident that I can cross this hurdle, despite those moments where I simply feel awful. \n\nI'd like to get to a point where I'm not a chameleon anymore and where I can be myself without being concerned whether I'm 'too much this or too little that'. I'm also convinced that my low self-esteem affects other areas of my life such as the way I dress, and how I shrink back at challenges that require delayed gratification.\n\nI worry about not smiling enough, not being personable enough, making vocal mistakes or stumbling on my words, being frantic, submitting too much to someone with narcissistic traits, being rejected by colleagues, friends or family, failing, and general self doubt. \n\nSome of the things I've done so far lately is: \n\n\\- Volunteering at an after-school club as an instructor. \n\n\\- Asserting myself to said latter colleague and requesting that he is more transparent and honest about any issues or mistakes made so that we can trust each other for the sake of professionalism. \n\n\\- Going for vocal lessons in order to strengthen my voice. I have a very soft voice which I believe comes from that lack of self-assertiveness and confidence. \n\n\\- Joining a musical theatre group and drama group. \n\nThose are just three things, but I've adopted those in the past week. \n\nA female that I look up to is Anna Wintour. I don't know about her actual work ethic but I find her inspiring. She's as self-confident as one could possibly be. These strong women motivate me to become someone who can command within herself respectability and accountability, as well as one who is just, fair, and reasonable. \n\nThank you for reading.",
