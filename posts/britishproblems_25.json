I don’t think I’ve ever cringed at something so much in my life. I questioned for the rest of the day, at what point did a producer turn around and say “you know what listeners would really love to here?

No. Will you refund me the difference? No. Straight up told the fact it didn't go through wasn't their fault in any way shape or form and I should have phoned them instead of using the app, because it 'doesn't work'.
