        "text": "For me, one of the things I loved the most about Black Mirror is the consistently incredible acting. This show really plays on your emotion and ability to see things simply. The hardest thing for me is how often I come to legitimately and honestly care for a character who is, by normal tv/movie standards, a “bad guy”.\n\nI could list thousands of my personal standouts, but I think I’ll just list 3.\n\n1) Lenora Crichlow in White Bear. No matter what I know she did, I find that episode gut-wrenchingly hard to watch largely due to her performance.\n\n2) Alex Lawther as Kenny in Shut Up and Dance. This episode completely and totally threw me for a loop and stunned me. This was due, in large part, to how engaging and empathetic Alex was in his role.\n\nAnd finally,\n\n3) Rafe Spall as Potter in White Christmas. His character was heartbreakingly real and empathetic. I struggle to watch his final scenes in this episode.\n\nHonourable mention to Daniel kaluuya in 15 Million Merits, who will always and forever be worthy of any and all awards. ",

Joke's on this spammer, all my webcams has been covered with tape for years.\n\n&gt;703563013543314 one of your pass word. Lets get straight to the point. You don't know me and you are most likely wondering why you are getting this email? No one has paid me to investigate you.\n\n&gt;actually, I setup a software on the adult streaming (pornography) web site and you know what, you visited this website to have fun (you know what I mean). While you were watching video clips, your internet browser started out working as a RDP that has a key logger which gave me accessibility to your display and web cam. Just after that, my software collected all of your contacts from your Messenger, Facebook, and e-mailaccount. Next I made a double video. First part displays the video you were watching (you've got a nice taste hahah), and second part displays the view of your web camera, &amp; it is u. \n\n&gt;You do have 2 possibilities. We are going to read the solutions in aspects:\n\n&gt;Very first alternative is to just ignore this e mail. As a result, I am going to send your actual tape to each of your your personal contacts and thus consider about the humiliation you will definitely get. Not to forget should you be in an important relationship, exactly how it will certainly affect?\n\n&gt;2nd alternative is to compensate me $3000. Let us name it as a donation. As a result, I will promptly remove your videotape. You can keep on daily life like this never happened and you never will hear back again from me.\n\n&gt;You'll make the payment by Bitcoin (if you do not know this, search for \"how to buy bitcoin\" in Google). \n\n&gt;BTC Address to send to: 1LnWkv2knkP5HEY82X76CJPBbvv82uCfzi [case-sensitive so copy &amp; paste it]\n\n&gt;Should you are planning on going to the cop, surely, this e-mail can not be traced back to me. I have covered my actions. I am also not attempting to charge a fee a lot, I just like to be paid for. You now have one day to make the payment. I have a unique pixel within this mail, and at this moment I know that you have read this mail. If I do not receive the BitCoins, I definitely will send out your video to all of your contacts including close relatives, colleagues, and so forth. Nonetheless, if I do get paid, I will erase the recording right away. If you want proof, reply  Yes &amp; I will send out your video recording to your 13 contacts. It is a non-negotiable offer therefore please do not waste my personal time and yours by responding to this email.",

While I find it fascinating to think about time used as torture, on the scale of millions of years, it also seems a little bit pointless - unless just getting us thinking about it as a concept is the point. I say pointless because this punishment is never experienced by the actual human being behind bars. He’s going to have to be sentenced in a way physically possible for a living human to experience. I fully understand interrogating a cookie, but it feels like that should be that while they construct a practical punishment for the human. Unless they’re simply feeling particularly sadistic that day - maybe they just like feeling powerful. What are your thoughts on punishing cookies for a human’s crime?",

However, this time, I almost threw up, even after turning off the sound AND turning away. Every time I tried to turn back to the screen, just seeing his toothless face (even with audio off) was enough to make me gag and double over. The whole second half of this storyline made me super anxious and uncomfortable. I still feel lightheaded and weird... blegh\n* I feel internal conflict over the punishment inflicted on Rolo by Nish. On one hand, from a morality standpoint what she did was wrong and unjustifiable. On the other hand, as someone who has PTSD from severe childhood bullying, I felt pleased and even ecstatic that Rolo was finally feeling the pain he inflicted on others. I actually felt like it wasn't ENOUGH pain, that Nish should have made hundreds of copies of Rolo's torture, to \"equal out\" the pain and suffering he caused her father. But, as I said, morally I do truly believe that inflicting infinite torture on any sentient being is just completely wrong. So I just keep arguing back and forth in my brain...\n* I really feel like someone needed to just destroy the monkey so that Carrie could die in peace. Why didn't Nish comfort her and then let her burn in the fire intentionally?\n* As a black woman, I felt personally violated by Clayton's torture in the third storyline. It just felt... racially motivated to me in some way. He was disposable.\n* I am so thankful to Black Mirror for helping me to be prepared in advance for any of the possibilities its episodes predict... I will know what to do and what not to do.\n\nJust feeling a lot and needed to process.",

        "text": "**EDIT: Sorry, I don't know how to hide the entire post behind a spoiler. Please don't read if you haven't watched \"Nosedive\" yet!**\n\n\nHey all,\n\nI just watched \"Nosedive,\" my first ever episode of Black Mirror, and I have to say...I don't find the society depicted in this episode to be all that horrifying. A lot of my friends who recommended this one to me have told me that it was \"nightmare fuel,\" etc., but I don't really agree. Some thoughts:\n\n1) That first elevator scene: I've been told and read on here that the elevator scene with Lacie and Bethany (?) is an excruciating one that really captures how shallow society in \"Nosedive\" is, but to me it honestly just came off as a typical \"office conversation\" you would have with some coworker you vaguely know. Unless your workplace is chill as hell, how chummy are you going to get with a coworker, especially one that is higher up than you (like Bethany seemed to be with Lacie)? Your conversations are all pretty much going to be like theirs, and I think if they were trying to convey how awful this society was, they could've had Lacie speak with Ryan like that, or something. \n\n2) Behavior towards service workers: One benefit of the rating system was definitely how people had some big incentives to be nicer to service industry workers. I'm not going to talk a lot more about this aspect because I think it's fairly straightforward, but I did want to add that I've seen some people comment on how horrible the airport check-in woman was, and honestly as someone who used to work in retail and been screamed and cussed at for circumstances beyond my control, it was a pretty satisfying scene.\n\n3) Upward mobility: This definitely goes both ways, and if you're unlucky like poor Chester the smoothie guy was, you could very quickly go down in ratings, but I did think that those benefits you gain from getting a higher rating are nice. I want a nice apartment but don't have quite enough money? Okay, I'll just post some pictures and be nice to people for a few months, and boom! I got it with a 20% discount. Wish it were that easy in real life. ",

        "text": "I've been enjoying this show very much and it seems that one of the themes that keeps coming back is that of simulated consciousness on par with a real person's. Such a technology raises a lot of truly interesting questions, about what it means to be alive or conscious, and about the value of life among others.  \n\n\n But the little thing that struck me the most was that with such cheap simulation as we see in the episodes in which such technology exists, surely it wouldn't take long until a number of brilliant minds are cloned which would put people completely out of business. Scientific discovery would reach new heights, and at such astounding speed, that no human could possibly keep up with it. In one of the later episodes, for instance, we can assume that a couple thousand fully conscious and intelligent beings were simulated for several years within a few seconds ; all this, powered by a cellphone. \n\nAll the engineers in the world doing, essentially for the most part, busy work would be but a droplet in a sea of intellectual manpower. Doctors and surgeons who, in real life, are being more and more assisted by machines (I'm thinking, for one, of very precise robotical arms which can be manned from afar, as well as diagnostics software) would only have the added value of being an actual person versus such a simulation which could, itself, use these tools directly. Even judges, lawyers, teachers, politicians, could they compete with simulated copies of brilliant minds with centuries if not millenia of experience?   \n\n\nYou could have countless simulated teachers in front of a million simulated classes, perfecting their craft, and it might take a few hours for a desktop pc to run the simulation. You'd then just replicate the highest scoring simulation and have them teach instead of real people or whisper directives into someone's ears. Could it be that, in this future, only the less qualified jobs still hold for real people? The ones that, traditionnaly, expect little more from you than a healthy body or humane qualities. Only this, I imagine, these simulations can not offer.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but this seems like a point that was never discussed in the series. I'm very curious about what you all think of this.",

The reason that guy made that video was because of the Mark Zuckerberg lawsuit going on right now about our personal data. \n\nThat got me thinking. What if an episode of Black Mirror was made addressing this? My ideas was that a company similar to google, apple, etc. would take out data and sell it to advertisers without telling us. Then another country would hack that and use it to wage some kind of biochemical warfare and kill almost an entire country. \n\nAnother version of that would be this: \nA DNA company similar to 23&amp;me was secretly giving our DNA to the government for whatever reason (they are actually doing that right now!) and then another country hacks it or gets it in some way and makes a disease with that information and kills the entire country. \n\nI don’t know if it’s good, it may be too similar to the bee episode but I personally would like to see an episode like this made. \n\nI made a different title because it wouldn’t let me post it.

Every hotel in the western world today has cameras in the hallways, elevators, stairwells, basements, parking garages, etc. And a hotel guest pushing a room service table down the hallways, in an elevator down to the parking garage, rolling it by her car, and taking out a BODY would have certainly been noticed.\n\nAnd she just shoved the body under the the rolling table without it being fully covered, hands and feet flapping around? \n\nAlso, the construction site factory would have ALSO had a bunch of security cameras all over the place. \n\nAfter she's tied up the insurance lady, and she asks if the insurance lady told any one where she was going, it makes no sense for the insurance lady to think that saying \"no one\" is the smart answer. If she had told no one where she was going, and no knew where she was or that she was even gone, it would take much longer for someone to start looking for her, which means it would have been that much easier and safer for Mia to kill her. However, if someone DOES know where the instance lady is, they will start looking for her relatively quickly when she doesn't return and the first place would be Mia's address. \n\nIt is laughable that Mia is now going to the insurance lady's house to murder her husband. What if there are 5 other people there in addition to the husband? She going to murder them too? What if a neighbor sees her walk in? She's going to murder them too, and their entire family? What if the shop owner on the corner sees her driving way, she's going to murder him/her too? Was she planning on murdering the entire town, just to make sure no one sees her murdering her next victim in her long and never-ending line of victims????\n\nDon't blame this on \"She was under duress and not thinking logically.\" This behavior is MORONIC. \n\nI loved the cinematography of this episode, and I actually did enjoy parts of the story, but the complete lack of logic is SO CRINGE.\")",

It also accurately portrayed being bisexual instead of making a joke of it. When a character is a minority, they don’t even address it (unless it had to be). I think that is great. Some shows do that just to be able to make jokes or say they are diverse. \n\nFor instance: Modern Family (Not trying to hate, sorry MF fans!) In MF there is a gay couple. They mostly just use their gayness for the but of a joke. There is also a woman who is Latina. They use her ethnicity as jokes, or make jokes about her troubled past. \n\nI really love the way Black Mirror is diverse and respectful. ",

        "text": "This is something I was pondering when I rewatched parts of Black Mirror recently, and I realised that the episode I have the most problems with is 'White Christmas', which I know sounds mad because it's a consistent fan favourite, but I hope some people would hear me out on this.\n\nThe episode's emotional core, acting, pacing, and twist ending all make the episode work... but I have major problems with the internal logic of the fictional universe this episode presents. Most episodes of Black Mirror, such as 'Be Right Back', 'Arkangel', and 'The Entire History of You' (as examples) do a great job establishing the practical use of the technology the episode is dealing with before exploring its consequences on society; White Christmas, not so much...\n\nFirst of all, the episode introduces the concept of the eye-implants which allow you to 'Block' people. The problems with this are immediately self-evident; that'd be far-out dangerous. You can't get yourself unblocked, even in an emergency. That's not so much of an issue, really, as the episode establishes that everyone has this eye-implant, so it's relatively normalised... But at the end of the episode, we see that Matt is physically incapable of being properly seen or heard by anyone. Can he just go around shoplifting now? How is his identity verified? Can he buy food at all? If he gets mortally wounded in some way, will he even be able to call an ambulance? There's just so many gaping questions about how this is supposed to work.\n\nHowever, my main issue with the episode is the presentation of the 'Cookies', as shown in the second \"mini-story\" of this episode...\n\n Sometimes when watching Black Mirror you have to make certain concessions that this hypothetical technology \"just works\" in order for the world they set up to make sense, and that's fine. But 'Cookies' are an idea that I cannot for the life of me make sense of as a concept.\n\n1) If Cookies are supposed to be a complete copy of your entire conscious self (up until the point its removed). So then why doesn't it remember having a Cookie made of itself? Matt has to explain the Cookie how the real her agreed to have one made. Wouldn't it remember that if it's supposed to have all the same memories?\n\n2) A Cookie is conscious (obviously, that's the main conceit of the episode) and completely disconnected from the real person. This means that a Cookie's memories will eventually \"diverge\" from that of the Cookie's owner after so many months or years, eventually impacting preferences and personality... which means the Cookie's conception of its real-self's preferences will no longer be accurate and you'll need to have a new one made, which involves surgery to get the Cookie implanted, a week for the Cookie to scan and copy your mind, and surgery to remove it again.\n\n3) The episode does nothing to establish *why* Cookies need to be conscious in order to operate the way that they do... outside of knowing exactly how you like your toast and when to make it (???) (I guess because using a timer on the toaster is somehow less practical for the human user? You still need to get up and put the bread in the toaster yourself and retrieve it? This is such an odd proof-of-concept, I don't know why they went with it.) Also it organises a daily planner. Again, the Cookie obviously has no knowledge of what's happening in your real life, so how is that useful?\n\n4) The Cookie is trapped in a plain stark-white room for all eternity and presumably never ages. The Cookie's owner, on the other hand, is out living a real life; meeting new people, trying new foods, working a job, watching films and TV, going on holidays... while the Cookie spends all of eternity in a plain room interacting with nothing but the air-conditioner controls and the toaster. The Cookie can't really have too much of an intimate knowledge of the real person's preferences, because every day is going to be slightly different and impact a person's wants and needs in so many ways it'd be impossible for a Cookie to account for all of these changes. What if this person goes out drinking one night or stays late at work and needs an hour's extra sleep in the morning before \"optimal\" waking time? The Cookie has no way of being able to adjust for all these variables because it's only as smart as the person who made it and can't \"re-sync\". It's entirely possible that a Cookie's performance at keeping all household conditions optimal will only work as desired for as little as a few days...\n\nIt is a creepy concept, to have a tiny min-slave of yourself living in virtual reality but the execution of this is so ridiculous I found it distracting, and it ended up detracting from my enjoyment of the 'twist' ending being a callback to the Cookie idea.",
