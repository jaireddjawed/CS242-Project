I was still logged in, so I had two options - either spend hours backing up all my data and doing a fresh install, or try to repair the drive. It was risky, but I decided to use testdisk on a live USB to try and recover the lost partition. Even if it failed, I would be able to use the same tool to recover my data anyway.\n\nAnd thankfully, it worked. I had a bit of trouble actually installing testdisk on the live drive (had to add 'universe' to my sources) but in the end the risk was worth it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a reminder to ALWAYS CHECK WHAT DEVICE YOU HAVE SELECTED WHEN USING GPARTED",

        "text": "I've been using Ubuntu LTS for desktops and servers for about 16 years. \n\nBeen using ZFS since '08, starting on OpenSolaris. Currently have both Btrfs and ZFS storage arrays at home.\n\nHave tried both Btrfs and ZFS as root filesystems, currently using ZFS, for home directory encryption (manually integrated with Pam).\n\nThere are two primary pain points over all this time - one of which has been solvable for a while, one which - arguably - is more recently solved in the mainstream. (Arguable because Btrfs or ZFS on root with snapshots has kind of provided a partial solution for a while.)\n\nThose things, as the title suggests, are:\n\n-\t**Rolling release**. Having a nicely configured system that has worked great for years - stuck on an old release, eg Ubuntu 18.04, sucks. I don't do in-place upgrades, with so many PPAs etc. (though periodically try), shit always breaks. And full reinstalls are a *major* PITA. I'm happy to update often. But not full reinstall. Need rolling!\n-\t**Immutable**. I'm so tired of dealing with updates that break midway through, leaving a partially-configured system. Ubuntu's ZSys was a good, if flawed, solution to this. But 'Immutable' (Yes I know the term gets stretched) takes it much further. I think it's well-past time to make that stepSt\n\t\nSo those two reqs alone, I haven't yet found a solution for, clearly stated. (But maybe all immutable distros are inherently 'rolling' even if they have major releases?)\n\nOn top of that, I also need to make sure the bistro can meet my existing baseline reqs, which are not at all easy to verify. Specifically:\n\n-\tCan run VFIO via KVM/Libvirt, ie my existing Windows VM with IOMMU passthrough to GPU and USB.\n-\tCan run root on ZFS, or at least user directories.\n-\tCan install XFCE and remove default DE.\n-\tCan run multiple wine prefixes (which via PlayOnLinux are just userland apps as are the wine versions).\n-\tAccess to a wide variety of user desktop applications. Flatpack integration and flathub repo might be good enough.\n\nBasically if I get this running well in a VM (save for the VFIO), I'll clone it to real SSDs and upgrade all my home servers and desktops with the image. (Then set up VFIO only on my primary desktop.)\n\nAn alternative to 'immutable' that I've been considering, is to run everything as a VM, with the host running only hypervisor and ZFS, auto-snapshotting the VM. As an example, my Windows VM runs on an encrypted ZFS pool of three nvme drives. Auto-snapshots get auto-sent to a ZFS server, and cloud-backed-up. It is effectively immortal windows. Only problem is, not all of my machines are beefy enough to do that yet, may be another 8 or so years to upgrade them all at standard pace.\n\n## I don't expect anyone to succeed at the research I've failed at. Just hoping someone has a similar use-case, and has cracked this nut already.",

        "text": "Not sure how many of your are in the market for a Linux laptop, but I thought I would share my own experience with the HP Dev One.\n\nI decided to pull the trigger on it a couple weeks ago when it was $200 off.  It actually arrived very quickly (in 2 days).  Overall I think it's a really fantastic laptop, excellent build quality and (obviously) excellent Linux compatibility.  I really love the screen (it's only 1080p, but it's beautiful, excellent vibrancy and blacks), the Thinkpad like \"nipple\", and the keyboard.  The CPU is a beast, having 8 cores/16 threads on a laptop is amazing for software development work.\n\nYou can even update the BIOS via `fwupdmgr` which is brilliant!  I didn't need to install anything special, I just ran `fwupdmgr get-updates` and then `fwupdmgr update`.  After that I rebooted and the BIOS update started.\n\nThe only downside that I see is that it only comes with 16GB of RAM which is a real bummer.  The RAM is at least it is user upgradable (unlike other laptops where the RAM is soldered on).  For about $900 USD (after the discount), it's still an absolute steal.\n\nCheck out the specs here: [https://hpdevone.com/](https://hpdevone.com/).  The discount code is in the banner at the top!\n\nIf anyone is interested in running other distros, I ended up installing Arch Linux on it, everything is working great and I didn't have to install any additional drivers.  There is an AUR package: [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hp-vendor-dkms-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hp-vendor-dkms-git) that apparently exposes Fan Speed and additional battery details, but I haven't installed it yet.\n\nPop\\_OS is great, but I can't give up Arch :)\n\nI'm really happy that more companies are supporting Linux on their hardware, so I'm inclined to support them when they put out a good product!",
