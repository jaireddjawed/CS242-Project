I have to dry them inside my apartment (no outdoors). It's humid here in summer so the drier they are before they're on the rack the better. The spinner we had was great it got clothes mostly dry and they dried well on the rack year round, but it makes a lot of racket and they're not allowed here.\n\nAnyone diy'd or found a good option?

Last year, I spent about $400 to replace all of the cushions foam, and I tightened the cords/wires that were inside. It felt like new for about a week. Now, it just hurts to sit on and immediately you can feel the wooden beams behind the cushions digging into your back, and it just dips so low.\n\nThe cushions themselves are still firm, there's just no support underneath them. I'm due in 8 weeks and I know realistically, I'll be sleeping on the couch for quite some time. Id really like to get this couch back to comfortable before the baby arrives.

When I took it to the dealers to evaluate the knocking they told me it's a rod bearing knock in the engine. I was quoted with a short block replacement for around 7grand assuming they don't discover further complications in the engine. The car is still running but my anxiety about this continues as I drive the vehicle. I owe almost 10k on the car so it seems kinda pointless to get fixed by the dealer.\n\nI am considering selling, but I just bought a home recently too. Im currently not able to add another set of car payment bills to my budget.\n\nAfter watching YouTube videos that describe replacing the rod bearing, it seems somewhat doable. I would need to buy some tools and replacement parts, but if the total cost is less than 2k, it would be saving a lot of money. I'm considering taking a week off work to attempt this repair once we're closer to spring. I have a garage to work in and I can rig up step by step guide and study the crap out of it beforehand.\n\nAny frugal people out the ever find yourself in this kind of position? Would trading in/buying a new car really mess me up as much as I'm afraid it wil?",

        "text": "I am planning to purchase a new mattress soon. The old one is a nice gel top but it’s definitely got worn in spots, the edges have no resistance any longer - it’s time. \n\nWe’re finally upgrading to a king size. I’m planning on getting a flat bottom frame so we won’t need a box spring. \n\nI am thinking to get a Nectar hybrid which is very highly rated and has a 365 day satisfaction guarantee and lifetime warranty. I just want to figure out the best way to pay for it. \n\nI can buy direct from Nectar, and they throw in sheets, pillows, and mattress protector as a bonus if you buy at the right time (planning to sign up for the special email discount with my husband’s email shortly before purchase to trigger this as I got the limited time offer when I first looked into buying). They also have a presidents sale going on soon with adds a discount. \n\nI can pay with my husband’s Amazon business card which has 2-3% interest rate I believe, and I’d pay off in 2-3 large payments after getting our tax return. \n\nOr I can pay with my discover card and get 3% cash back bonus from it, but unless I pay it all off immediately I don’t see myself coming out ahead with my 15% interest on that card. \n\nI could buy from Amazon while opening an Amazon card myself for this sole purchase and get an additional $150 off my first purchase after approval, then pay off quickly to avoid interest. \n\nI’m not opposed to opening a credit card from somewhere else for this to get the best bonus as I haven’t opened a credit line in 7+ years and I’m not planning any other purchases or major changes any time soon. I would just close it after paying off off the mattress + frame. I’m pretty sure to get approval as I have 780+ credit score.\n\nI haven’t made a purchase this big in a long time and want to maximize benefit without having to pay the whole sum up front. \n\nThe total cost I assume is going to be $1700-2000 as the mattress is sticker $1399 and the frame will be about $200. \n\nI’m also open to other mattress brands if Nectar is actually frivolously expensive and I just don’t know that because I have no experience with this…",

        "text": "...for the next 2 years at least anyway. Then it'll still only be $30.\n\nStory time!\n\nI've had Spectrum home cable internet for many years. As demands for faster and faster internet persisted, they were always raising their speeds for a \"free upgrade\" but would then up the monthly price too months later. Spectrum is the only internet provider in our area aside from a just as expensive and significantly slower DSL internet company.\n\nA year or so ago I helped my father in law move into his new apartment and signed him up with Spectrum. When we were online doing so, I noticed there was a few plans to chose from. One of which was a 100mbit plan that was $29.99 for the first two years, doubling after that.\n\nI got about 300mbit down so I knew I wasn't on this plan. I'm tech savvy enough to know that 100mbit is actually way more speed than 99.99% of the people who use the internet will need, so we signed him up for that.\n\nAlso along the way, it encouraged him to sign up for the Emergency Broadband Benefit. This was a program released during covid that would help low income families pay for their internet. It would pay $30 each month off your internet bill.\n\nThis program was renamed to the ACP ( Affordable Connectivity Program) and was made into a long term program.\n\nI immediately went home and signed up for the ACP and was approved. I also asked to be downgraded to the lower tier internet which they refused to do, claiming it was only for new customers.\n\nThere wasn't much I could do at this point. To be come a new customer, you have to have canceled your service for at least a month, and we weren't willing to go without internet for a month, so we were trapped. They have a monopoly and they knew it. Even during this time, they will still upgrading their speed and slowly raising their price, grandfathering me into higher and higher teirs.\n\nA year later, I got an email inviting me to try t-mobiles 5g home internet. I jumped on this in hopes I could use it as a life raft for a month to return to Spectrum as a new customer.\n\nI signed up, got my 5g router and it worked great! Same price and faster than Spectrum.\n\nWhen I called to cancel Spectrum, I told them straight up that the only thing that would keep me from canceling is if they offer me the 100mit internet package at $29.99 a month for 2 years. They immediately agreed without hesitation.\n\nWith the ACP paying $30 a month, that covers my entire bill.\n\nIf anyone reading this is in the same boat as I was, don't be afraid to try alternatives, or even call to cancel your services to get your price lowered. They will do anything to keep your money going into their pockets every month.",

In the past, I would just take a class to reduce the number of points on my license, but after some research, is that even worth it?\n\nBased on what I've read online (could be totally wrong), reducing points on the driver's license doesn't mean anything because the points stay on there for up to four years (depending on state)? So what's the point of paying to take this class to reduce points on your license? Strictly a money grab?\n\nMy sole purpose is to not have my insurance premiums increased because of these five points. If I can take the class to reduce the points on my license, then I will do it but seems like it's not that cut and dry.\n\nAny help appreciated!",

For example, if I was making a big purchase I used to look at every store that sold it, factor in delivery, variations, 10 tabs open on my laptop, hours spent, stressed out by the end. Now I go to the store that sells it and buy it outright, in and out because I know what I want, but… I’m saving myself hours, a lot of stress, and spending only maybe €20 more. \n\nI also decided to spend money on buying the expensive product I know works for me, over the cheaper products I’m not happy with. \n\nI don’t think that I always need to buy the cheapest option, or spend hours to save a few euros, but I think I’ve gone a little too far in the other direction. \n\nHow do you balance?",

They've been there for awhile, so I feel like I could get a little more off the purchase price too. \n\nThe only thing I'm nervous about is the fact that these cars used to be rental cars.
