I almost always prefer to stand anyway because I like my personal space, but then it always feels awkward declining. Especially to the woman who was offering - I said \"Thank you but no, you have a &lt;i&gt;baby&lt;/i&gt;.\" and she still kept insisting.  \n\n\nI have mixed feelings because while I appreciate their kindness, I'm starting to wonder if it's because I look older than I am, or pregnant.

You can see a glimpse by checking my previous post. How can I work on not raising my voice and yelling? It’s so hard for me when I get triggered.\n\nThe fight this morning: \n\nHe gets back from a 24 hour EMT shift at 8am. I’m still in bed because my work is flexible. I don’t want to sound like a lazy bum.. I clean the apartment, do chores, care for our dog everyday, and have the privilege to work remotely which is nice. I am also the breadwinner at this time. He is still in the beginning pursuing his career path. \n\nHe asks when he walks in… “so did you make me food last night”? I’m half awake in bed.. “uhhmm no.” This wasn’t talked about at all the night before but I get it, he is tired and it would have been nice to come back to a meal. I get up to go make him steak and eggs. I happen to use the bigger pan cover on the pan so there’s the tiniest bit of water dripping down onto the stove. He said I should have used the smaller one otherwise the stove will get dirty. I wipe the stove regularly btw. he has cleaned it 4x in 8 months. I’m very annoyed already. I shouldn’t be. Usually this would be no big deal but he is often very critical about me over small things. It’s hard to live with and it’s built up where i have no patience now. I hate getting asked many times did I wash my hands? Did I make sure to do this or that? Make sure u do this! I am a grown adult and I do things properly and cleanly and yes I wash my hands. But yes I made the mistake of using the big cover.. which I don’t think is a big deal.\n\nAnyways, he then proceeds to say why didn’t i have the food waiting for him or even better make it last night so he could heat it. I’m standing there making him fresh food and I said he is not appreciating what I am doing. Then he goes psh “how easy it is to make steak and eggs on the pan.. I could do it myself. You didn’t start cooking until I said something.” He is really getting under my skin. I just start raising my voice and saying how unappreciative he is and how I feel bothered. He said I’m too soft and sensitive. I am a sensitive emotional person and he is not. We have a talk and I finally tell him my recent feelings about how I am not at peace in this relationship and we have different priorities, aren’t able to communicate in fights, maybe are too different. It’s so hard for me not to react nowadays. And I end up feeling like it’s partly my fault due to me reacting. How do I control this? I hate the feeling bc I feel I’m not in control when I react and this isn’t healthy. In a future relationship I do not want to be like this too.",

        "text": "If you have older kids now, was there ever a point you were finally honest with them about it? \n\nFor context, I spent the first 3 years of my child's life in nonstop family court - 33 hearings, mostly frivolous vindictive litigation, multiple sanctions against my ex, etc. As you can imagine the stress was pretty unbearable at times especially single parenting a toddler, and learning how to navigate court to keep my attorneys fees low has been a second full-time job for me. It has calmed slightly since divorce / custody was finalized but I'm still being dragged back to court over the most random things (currently him trying to move child support out of the state he lives, so he can lower it, despite statutes saying he can't) with little legal repercussion to him ever. \n\nAt this point I manage it all much better because I'm used to it and I'm numb to how horrifying it all is. (And I love my child so much, it's still worth everything I go through.) But the financial aspect definitely still affects my life, my child's life. For example, when I first separated, I attempted to purchase a house for us but most of my down payment was drained by court. Then for 2 years I saved and started putting offers in on houses and was just about to put another offer on one. But I was met with another frivolous court filing and I had to retain not one but two attorneys in two separate states, which would have completely emptied out my emergency fund had I actually purchased that house too. It's now obvious to me that I need to have massive amounts of cash semi-liquid at all times in the likely case I'm back in court and we will need to stay in our little apartment (which no, isn't the worst thing in the world, we have a nice apartment and at least we have a home.) I do save a lot by representing myself in hearings but I still need to cough up these massive retainers just to get a temporary attorney to consult me. \n\nMy child is still young so there are never any discussions about this and I'm currently of the belief that I never want to. Despite my ex's behavior I still give my ex all information necessary for him to show up in our child's life and then however he decides to engage, is his decision. We are in two different states so custody is split 90/10, so I never have to engage with him much in person. I also want my son to form his own opinions based on how his other parent treats him and behaves towards him, not based on my feelings and experience. Plus I think children internalize the problems between their parents and don't quite yet have the emotional tools necessary to process that. \n\nBut sometimes I wonder about once he gets older and starts asking questions, what am I supposed to say? There have been birthday trips of his cancelled because of these out of nowhere court filings and hearing dates I have to attend. One trip was nearly cancelled because my ex wouldn't sign the necessary form allowing me to travel out of the country with our child and a court had to force him. (At my expense - again.) My inability to buy us a house, we live far away from his school and friends. The fact that my family and my friends want the ex nowhere near them (valid and it's their right to feel as such, it went far beyond just normal divorce drama - he viciously went after them all too in court) so he will never be welcome to any birthday parties, holiday gatherings, etc with my family/friends. They would never say anything in front of our child but children are smart, they can and will recognize tension. I anticipate my child asking why his father isn't included. I anticipate him asking why no one likes his father. I anticipate me eventually getting tired of the blame being put on me when birthday trips are cancelled, life decisions put on pause, because of the behavior of his father. But I also don't ever want to \"put this\" on him - I have a parent who does this and it's shitty, because while my other parent isn't perfect, they're still my parent. \n\nI know so much of this is \"who knows? See how you feel when you get there\" but it weighs on me. I'm 38 and while I do have a few divorced friends, none of them experience this hellish co-parenting.  I guess I'm just looking for some insight from older mothers who are dealing or have dealt with something similar - were you ever honest with your child about what the other parent was doing to you? When?",

        "text": "  \n\n**The Set Up:** I’m the sole employee of a community development nonprofit. I have a couple of people who I pay to help with some very specific tasks, but for the most part the lion’s share of the work falls to me. I’ve been doing this over a decade in a field with a lot of turn over, so I have tens of thousands of hours of experience relative to others doing the same thing, have won awards in my field and am generally considered hard working, knowledgeable, passionate and capable by my peers and funders who I have to answer to.\n\nI also have a board of directors who are mostly nice people, but have no clue what it takes to do this job. They are all volunteers who spend an hour or two each month on this program.\n\n**The Background:** For years I’ve had one male board member who is smart, hardworking, manipulative and emotionally erratic. More than once I’ve observed him in shouting matches at board meetings with other male board members over the stupidest things. More than once he’s screamed at me with barely contained rage over nothing things, as well. Sometimes over things I didn’t do and he simply imagined. This org has no terms limits so there are very few ways to remove anyone, but after I went to my board president (a man who has also had similar run ins with Erratic Guy) years ago over the last incident we got a rule adopted by the board that basically outlined Erratic Guy’s behavior without naming him and made it grounds for immediate dismissal from the board. Also since the last time I have avoided taking any more meetings with him outside of the presence of other board members and all email with him gets my board president bcc’ed on it. \n\n**The Current Issue:** For months now Erratic Guy has been suspiciously quiet. At the same time, a second board member – a woman who is his neighbor and who collaborates with him on projects from time to time – has begun complaining about things I’m either A. Not doing enough of or B. Not doing to her liking. And when the board is together the two of them both mirror exactly the same complaints, which of course I’ve worked hard for months to address (I personally find it preferable to simply get work to a higher standard if people find something lacking), but neither of them have been satisfied yet. Of course I’m convinced they have some toxic feedback loop of negativity now when it comes to me. I used to have a fine relationship with her, but now it’s kaput.\n\n**The Latest Thing:** I’m turning out more work than ever, but twice now in the last month the woman board member has sent me curt emails demanding answers as to why something was done a certain way. (I don’t want to be too specific here, but these were super minor nothings in a mountain of work that I’ve successfully pushed out the door.) \n\n**The Outcome:** Naturally I got our board president involved again, because fuck this fucking goddamn shit and he agreed that she’s been rude, told me he’d reach out to her and the Erratic Guy (because her in last complaint about me to me she mentioned Erratic Guy as “probably” being upset, which Board Pres and I read as, “he’s already complained to her.”) and to basically not worry about it because I’m doing a great job, etc.\n\n**Finally! My Question to You All!:** Erratic Guy is basically a neutral personality to a curmudgeon when seen in person, but this woman is typically all smiles and pom poms. As a woman whose go-to methodology is always kill em with kindness, I don’t see how any more kill em with kindness will help the situation and I’m still fucking pissed about this constant sniping.\n\n**TL;DR:** How should I deal with an adult mean girl moving forward when her persona is always “Hey, hon!” and smiles, but has yet to apologize for her rudeness? I mean, I’m not holding my breath that one will come. Just noting that an apology would help to mend our working relationship and without one I’m not certain how I should behave in front of her. I’m still too overworked and underpaid to also have to put up with this garbage from fucking volunteers and I don’t feel like participating with fake smiles and mean girls bullshit. \n\n**Note:** I know Reddit likes to suggest leaving jobs, but I’m old and this is literally the only job I’ve ever liked, let alone loved, and I’m also good at it. I’m not going to leave it because of a few assholes. I'm not sure how to get term limits going, but it's something I'll explore this year with our parent organization.",

I just shrugged cause I'm used to it and gave no response. Then he said but you DO know it's unhealthy right right right. Like scientifically it is proven unhealthy. Like assuming I don't actually know this. Religious practices defying logic? No shit sherlock. \n\nSorry for the swearing.",

        "text": "First off let me say that my husband is an incredible man in so many ways. He's empathetic, supportive, kind, funny, and playful. We share many hobbies, passions, opinions, and views of the world. I love him. BUT. I've been finding myself being less and less sexually attracted to him. \n\nWhen we first started dating, up until now (6 years later), I've pushed aside a lot of physical and sexual wants, that I always deemed unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Things like him needing sex a bit less than I do, him not being as into some kinks that I'm very into (nothing major, I like to be man handled and perhaps wear a leash every now and then), and his physical appearance. He's a good-looking man with his clothes on, but is physically out of shape and has a belly, which unfortunately prohibits us from doing some positions. \n\nThat last one always made me feel so selfish and judgy for feeling. And I successfully pushed it out of my brain for a while, but ultimately you can't force what you're sexually attracted to. I had never been with someone who was out of shape and sometimes all I could focus on while have sex was his belly, which turned me off big time. Over the years, I've respectfully brought up him losing some weight, but ultimately nothing has changed. \n\n\nI would constantly tell myself, he's an incredible human after all, whom I adore, the sex should get better and better over time, right? And he can always just lose some weight and things will get back on track? Right? \n\nWrong. Things have been very stagnant. At least when we first started dating there was more adventure and playfulness in the bedroom. He really tried and seemed to enjoy it all. But now, sex will last a couple of minutes and he won't even try to get me off once he does, unless I say something. We do the same few positions in the same place. It's all very routine and stale. I find myself not wanting sex as much now. I don't feel excited for it. It feels like more of a chore. \n\nI find myself drifting my gaze from him and watching a lot more porn on my own. Fantasizing about other people. \n\nI feel so stuck. I feel so guilty and selfish for feeling this way. I don't know what to do.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am going out with a girl I have matched on a dating app and I would like your opinion on a matter.\n\nWe matched on the app and after a couple of days of chatting, I invite her to dinner. The dinner goes well and after it, I try to go for a kiss but she dodges me saying she just met me and she doesn’t know me.\n\nOn the second date we meet for a coffee and we kiss.\n\nOn the third date, we spend a Sunday out of the city. The day goes very well, she seems really into me and any occasion is good for kissing and hugging. I invite her on the way to the city to come to mine but she refuses saying “no otherwise is going to happen….” However, when I am almost dropping her to her place she ask me if we want to park somewhere for some “hugging” which brought me some steps forward regarding our intimacy. \n\nForth date for San Valentine, I tried to invite her to dinner at mine to cook for her but she refuses for the previous reasons saying she need to be ready in her head before than physically. Dinner goes well and we are both looking forward to the check to park somewhere and mess a bit around.\n\nSo I see that she is quite attracted physically to me and she likes me. I do like her quite a lot as well but I do not understand what is keeping her to have more intimacy with me. She is holding herself because when we are intimate in the car she always does more than she would expect. I explain to her that I would never make her do anything she doesn’t want even if she comes at mine but she says that every time I seduce her and she does more than expected. \n\nNow we are both in our late 30s and we like each other. I don’t understand why she is holding back like that in this situation should be a pleasure for both of us to get intimate. Moreover, I think is important to experience more intimacy to also understand how much we are compatible and to avoid making sex a taboo in some sort of way by creating too many expectations.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that?",

Etc etc I’m not sure this is the healthiest approach so keen to hear other perspectives. \n\nI also appreciate the irony of posting asking for tips to change myself to stop thinking that I am the one who always needs to improve… gosh it’s exhausting!\n\nThank you in advance",

        "text": "Hi, 34M here, I do not know if this is the right place to talk about this but I've always came here to read and learn because I feel this is one of the greatests subreddits.\n\nBit of context first, then my issue.\n\nI ended a 10 year relationship with a woman (34) about 2 years ago. It was a mutual decision because we felt our relationship had became more like a friendship, and we were not acting, feeling or thinking as a couple anymore. So we decided to end it, no harsh feelings from either her or myself.\n\n3-4 months ago, a friend (32F) I knew for two years asked me out. She was already into me but she did not make any move because I was in a relationship. I did not know her feelings, because we were not that close. We are both in a larger group of friends (around 15 people)\n\nShe also ended a 10 year relationship, about 3 years ago. It was like 'the' relationship she had because the guy was her first sex partner, her first everything, etc. The guy ended the relationship because he wanted to try something else with another woman. He's still with this woman now.\n\nSo she asked me out, and I thought, yeah, why not. And the thing is we're pretty much in love now. I haven't remembered feeling so comfortable with someone in a long time. So everything is great.\n\nAfter her relationship ended, she tried something she did not try before: casual sex. She started dating, Tinder, having hookups, etc. She had 11 sex partners in almost 2 years. No relationships. I understand, her husband was the only sex experience she had.\n\nI had 5 sex partners in all my life. All of them were relationships. I never felt comfortable with the idea of casual sex, I would not know how to move or react in that kind of situation with a woman I just met couple hours ago. That kind of scheme, and dating apps, are just not for me.\n\nBecause of this, sometimes I feel that I 'took away' that kind of life from her. What she was experiencing, the hookups, the dating life, etc.\n\nI told her this and she told me I was insane, that it was a phase, something she wanted to experiment at the time when she got out of her relationship. She told me I did not 'take away' anything from her, that she choosed to have something with me and that now she wants everything with me.\n\nAnd yet sometimes I think in all those guys she was with, all 'irrelevant' according to her. Because I don't understand how you can have sex with someone you consider 'irrelevant', I think I put everything on the 'same level' --- so sex with me would be the same thing as sex with a stranger. So why would I be different?\n\nThis made me feel that I am somehow 'competing' with these irrelevant guys. And I don't know why.\n\nObviously, I told her this, because communication is key. And she told me that, for starters, she liked me from a long time ago, and once we started dating, she fell in love with me. There is a connection that she says she never felt with anyone when she was dating with random guys. She does not have any contact with any of them.\n\nSex is wonderful, don't get me wrong, probably the best I had in my life. She is also telling me the same. We're just too connected. I love her, and she loves me.\n\nI think it is just how we have different approaches regarding sex, and how I am unable to treat an 'irrelevant sex partner' as irrelevant, and not as a threat. Because -in my mind- if you had sex with that person, it could never be 'irrelevant', so my insecurities arise.\n\nOverthinking all over the place, right? Do you have any advice so I can stop shooting myself in the foot?",

I spend breaks in the bathroom trying not to fully cry, and commutes home also trying not to fully cry and have a moment on the bus.  \n\nWomen who have managed to pick themselves up out of similar situations and thrive, how did you get the ball rolling? Did you do some major mental spring cleaning, cut out all the bullshit wasting your time and somehow fully commit to a full career/industry change? Did you take extended time off and actually use that time to change the trajectory of your life? \n\nI'm having one of those scary moments where I'm feeling alone, hopeless and extremely unprepared. Changing careers feels impossible to me, even researching and finding what I might be into for the next 30-40 years seems impossible, I'm tired. And scared. Please help.",

Can anyone who’s had this procedure elaborate- will this really not be excruciating and traumatizing? Will some ibuprofen and a Valium sufficiently prepare me? Am I walking into a trap?",

My mom doesn’t get along with any of her siblings which made my relationship with my cousins tough. I actually do like my cousin on my dad’s side but she lives in another country a 12 hour flight away. I have one grandparent left who I used to have a good relationship with as a kid but we have a big language barrier and she’s sadly become extremely depressed and bitter, and I have a hard time knowing what to even talk to her about. \n\nI literally get no enjoyment out of seeing my family.

To update you, he has fluid in his head that's not draining. It most certainly will lead to brain damage if he survives.\n\nIf you were having a pregnancy where the baby may not make it and the toddler was aware that another baby was coming, would you tell your toddler? Maybe something like \"baby is sick\" and mommy is \"sad.\"\n\nWhen I visited my family going thru this struggle, they acted like everything was okay for the toddler. He's a bright and bubbly kid. Well they were so distraught that his clothes were not only on backward but also insideout. It was soul crushing to watch. I'm glad I was able to feed them.\n\nWould you tell your four year old \"baby is sick\" that way you wouldn't have to pretend and \"save face\" at the house? I mean, they have to pretend everything is okay everywhere else. I feel so bad for them.\n\nI'm not a parent so I have no idea. I just wanted other mom's opinions. Thanks",

Mostly because in every setting, I'm always the \"third friend on the sidewalk\" kinda thing, you know?

I tried to put myself out there again but none of that really worked, my quietness can be off-putting to most people. Now that I'm on my late 20's and having loads of self-reflection, I'm starting to realize that I don't want to actively pursue friendships anymore. I love staying in and do my own things, I go out on my own sometimes when I feel like it and I rarely go out with the very few friends I still have. But somehow, I still feel the pressure that I s*hould* want this. That I should want having more friends and an active social life, that I should try harder to put myself out there. Which leaves me feeling like a huge weird alien for not wanting any of that. \n\nI do feel happy with my own solitude, when I'm not overthinking about all that, but recently I've been feeling like I have something wrong and I don't know what to do with this guilt.

Plus “I don’t need a strong emotional connection to have sex with my partner.” And “I just see sex as something you do in a relationship.” And there I was thinking “why can’t we just lay in bed and caress and kiss and get to know each other?” \n\nPlease don’t come at me in the comments for sleeping over at his house - I’m aware of my part in this. \n\nAfter we broke up, I told him I wanted a chance to tell him some things from my perspective in the relationship, and he let me. (He was the one who initiated the break up, unfortunately.) \n\nWe met at a park and I told him some of the things he did/said that made me feel uncomfortable, and one of those things was repeating what he said that I mentioned in that post. I told him how uncomfortable it made me feel. And I repeated his words exactly. \n\nI think he vacillated between taking responsibility and not quite wanting to admit how bad it sounded. His response was “What I meant by that (“you are more than welcome to stay but I might have a hard time respecting your boundaries”) was that if you stayed the night and we were in the same bed and you changed your mind at some point, that I wouldn’t be respecting your original boundary.” I had described feeling disrespected and wondering if he cared about me and he said “I can see why it came off that way, but it wasn’t my intention.” \n\nWhich, to me doesn’t make a ton of sense. I’m hesitant to call it straight up gaslighting, but he did imply that I misinterpreted his intentions - and I likely did not. \n\nBut then later in our talk he stopped me to say “I just want to take some responsibility for that. Those are things that I said and did.” \n\nBut he never actually just said “I’m sorry.” “I’m sorry for acting that way.” \n\nI’m proud of myself because old me would have stewed in it forever and I chose to speak up and hold him accountable for his actions and tell him how it impacted me. And hopefully he takes what I said seriously and grows from it. But if not, I got to say my piece.",

Well after we moved in, we discovered the guest bathroom is infested with roaches. Tiny little baby roaches but they’re everywhere. They’re coming out of the shower head and bottom of the tub, so most likely they’re laying eggs behind the walls 🙃 we actually found two egg sacs so far. Been finding a few in the living room and master bath as well. Went to the office and thankfully they allowed us to cancel our lease without penalty. We’ll also get some prorated rent refunded. They asked if we wanted to switch units and I’m so turned off by the whole experience, we said no and we want to leave completely.\n\nSO. That means we have to move AGAIN. Yesterday we applied for a much nicer apartment in a nicer area and currently just waiting to hear back about approval. If we’re approved we will be moving this Tuesday. I am EXHAUSTED. Moving is exhausting no matter what and this just drained me. We hired movers so I’m frustrated we just wasted money for nothing. When we move again we’ll just get a uhaul and do it ourselves but not looking forward to that at all because I’m out of shape lol \n\nI’m just always very organized and prepared, so typically I sign leases a few months before I move. So having to move again all within a week is so stressful. Knowing we just packed everything, then UNpacked almost everything, now having to REPACK everything. It’s a lot. \n\nThe past few days have been an absolute whirlwind. The one bright side is we got engaged on Friday (before this shitshow), so it’s comforting to see how well we work together during such a stressful, chaotic time. \n\nThat’s it. Just needed to vent. Everything will be fine and it definitely could be worse. But in this moment everything is overwhelming and stressful so I’m ready for it to all be over!",

        "text": "I think I am depressed. I have tried to find a therapist but it is very confusing. I don't have time to go in person and reviews online says places like Better Help and Cerebral are no good. So I'm going without any therapist I guess. \n\nI hate my job. I think it is the field I am in. I am so tired of tech that I am looking to enroll in college again for another bachelor's degree in accounting just so I can get out of tech.\n\nIn the meantime, I feel stuck at this new job I have. It is work from home, which is great. But I am having trouble finding the motivation to try and be a good employee. I don't care about the job or the company and I don't want to work there. I received almost no training and have very little idea of what I am supposed to be doing. I would quit but they just paid for me to fly out to an upcoming conference so now I feel guilty. Plus I haven't even been there a year yet. \n\nI can't stop dwelling on it. Every time I get a chat or email, I feel dread because I know it will be something I don't know how to do because I was never trained. And then there are the endless video call meetings where sometimes I spend an hour watching people argue about what we should be talking about. Other departments seem much better organized and everyone says how great it is to work there, but I don't see it.\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't have close friends and I think my husband is tired of hearing me complain constantly. So I don't really have anyone I can talk to. I miss being a cheerful and happy wife. I feel like I will never get that person back. She's gone. I'm stuck in this terrible nightmare and she didn't make it.\n\nThis isn't what I wanted in life. I want a simple job where I clock out at the same time everyday and don't think about it again. But those don't seem to exist anymore. Not one that would pay me enough. \n\nI've tried daily exercise and that does seem to help. But I can stop dwelling on how much I hate what I do and how depressed I am.",

While he understands that these behaviors are \"bad,\" he will not accept them as problematic or abusive.  I am concerned about the overall trajectory here.\n\nBetween those two things, the foundation of our relationship eroded.

        "text": " Here are some steps you can take to get relief from joint pain:\n\n1. Rest: If your joint pain is caused by overuse or injury, it's essential to rest the affected joint and avoid any activities that may aggravate the pain.\n2. Apply heat or cold: Applying heat or out to the affected joint can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Use a warm compress for stiff joints and a cold compress for swollen or painful joints.\n3. Take over-the-counter pain relievers: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen can help relieve joint pain.\n4. Exercise: Low-impact exercises such as walking, swimming, or yoga can help improve joint flexibility and reduce pain.\n5. Lose weight: Excess weight puts extra strain on the joints, so losing weight can help reduce joint pain.\n6. Use assistive devices: Assistive devices such as braces, canes, or crutches can help take pressure off the affected joint and reduce pain.\n7. Get physical therapy: Physical therapy can help improve joint mobility, reduce pain, and strengthen the muscles that support the affected joint.\n8. Try alternative therapies: Alternative therapies such as acupuncture, massage, or chiropractic care may help reduce joint pain for some people.\n\nIt's important to talk to a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program or taking any new medication, especially if you have an underlying medical condition or are taking prescription medications.

        "text": "38, so still a ways away from menopause, but in my early 30s, my cycles changed a lot. I went from q28 days and 6-7-day long heavyish periods to much shorter cycles and only 4-day periods where only the first 2 days are heavyish. The shortest cycle I had was only 21 days. In the last 2 years, I have also been dealing with severe depression, burnout, chronic fatigue, etc. I am much better now after ketamine-assisted therapy and antidepressant #8, but I continue to have some symptoms, including basically no libido. I saw a naturopath who found my progesterone was on the lower end of normal and my estrogen was on the higher end, but she felt that while I was estrogen-dominant, these values were not significant enough to blame low P for my symptoms. I then recently saw a TCM practitioner (who was a surgeon back in China, so also trained as a regular MD) who strongly suggested progesterone supplementation. I looked into it a bit more and the symptoms of low P definitely ring true with me - low libido, night sweats, poor sleep, fatigue. I've been worked up medically to the gills so I know there is nothing else going on to explain this outside of stress/burnout. \n\nLooking for personal experiences with progesterone supplementation in other women who are not yet perimenopausal/menopausal. I am a little wary because I had a progesterone (levonorgestrel) IUD years ago that gave me extreme fatigue, the kind that had me lying down on the floor because I could not walk from one room to another. For those of you who have had success, do you supplement daily or just in the second half of your cycle?\n\nThanks. P.S. Please don't tell me to ask my doctor, I'm a doctor, looking for personal experiences.",

        "text": "I am married and super happy. But there is a background: There is an Ex whom i dumped two years ago (for serious reasons)  and he went on haunting me for one whole year, defiantly refusing the breakup. He always needed deeeeeeeeep therapeutic discussions and dialogues and deliberations and debates about us, our unconscious, our connections, our motives, crap, crap, crap etc etc etc and still more crap and then why we could potentially still get together. It was plain abuse. I gave him months to absorb the shock, but when he started becoming a creep at work and a never ending nuisance, i blocked him from whatsapp and informed him per email that i would never talk to him again. Till the end he went on viciously accusing me of being evil, and insensitive and roguely 'obstructing peace process' by not talking to him oh just one more last time. In his very last email he accused me of being Amber Heard, who just trampled the poetic, sensitive Johnny Depp of him and never gave him a chance to speak the truth in his heart and how Judge Ascarate would find me guilty.\n\n\nWell fast forward to an year. I am very very happy with my life and my new marriage. Out of courtesy i unblocked him on whatsapp some time ago, and thought he had moved on with his life. But on Valentines, totally out of the blue i got a whatsapp message from him, wishing me happy Valentine's. Of course that was distasteful, since i am married and am expecting. He knows that too, bc i have made my 'married' status very clear on my WhatsApp profile. So I, in response, quietly blocked him again.  Didn't say a word to anyone. Now he is sending me emails about how fragile my ego is, and how his acts of kindness towards me get responded with active abuse from my side, and how this latest episode of hysterical tendency of mine proves I am an Amber Heard who raises false alarms and how I should be punished by God and by the courts for hurting the affectionate darling of Johnny Depp in him. If he got the Media's attention, he would 'sue my ass a million dollars,' he wrote.\n\nAre there any women out there, who get maligned for 'overacting' when it is actually they who are victims of some super despicable and inappropriate behaviour? After the Depp-Heard saga, why would psychopathic self-congratulatory men identity themselves with the winner of the trial when it is super obvious that their stories are different?

She’s mostly gotten over this but one thing I’ve noticed is that she still buys his boxers, deodorant, tooth paste, and sometimes she’ll buy him work pants. I can’t honestly count on one hand how many times he’s actually bought this stuff for himself. And I know for sure he has never bought his own boxers. While I do think it’s a very nice gesture, I don’t really understand why she still buys his boxers. I’m not a guy so maybe this is something that most guys get from their moms.. I’m not really sure.

I am now struggling to accept my under eyes as they are. While I would probably have (more) fat grafting, I do not want to go near fillers (too risky and prone to going wrong), and have come to the conclusion that it is probably best to try to accept it as it is. \n\nI have been told by others they did not even notice my eye hollows until I pointed it out to them, and I think most of them were honest at that. I have seen people with eye hollows that, well, they just looked like people, and they were average or beautiful or what have you. It didn't detract from their appearance (to me) at all. However, for myself (ton of self loathing due to trauma and mental illness), I find them extremely ugly (to the point that I had body dysmorphia centered around it and couldn't leave the house and was hospitalized (there were other reasons too of course -  I just want to make clear when I say I find them ugly on me, I find them *ugly*)). \n\nI want to know **how many of you find eye hollows/deep tear troughs actually ugly**, in general; does it detract from that woman's beauty if she is otherwise average/beautiful looking and has other nice features, dresses nice etc.? \n\nI'd appreciate honesty. I'm trying to come to terms with my face and be at least \"neutral\" about it. \n\nPS. I will have a follow up with the surgeon, where I will address my dissatisfaction. Yes, I am in therapy, have been for a long time.",

We hang out together, laugh, talk, watch shows and whatnot. But we haven't been out on a date in years. Years and years. I've brought it up before and we always make plans to go out but then the kids don't cooperate or he's too tired or we just don't ever go do it. Holidays are celebrated for the kids, he is very blase about them and I have accepted that. I give presents and don't receive them which can get annoying but I know that's just not him. Holidays are just another day to him he doesn't see the reason for treating someone special on a certain day. \n\nI don't need more time with him, we pretty much spend all of our time together anyway when we aren't working. I just need...fun time with him, I guess. He doesn't understand that and I don't know how to explain it being that important to me. I guess it probably shouldn't be at this point anyway lol. \n\nTldr: me and my partner of 13 don't go out and haven't in years for various reasons and I really miss that one on one fun time and don't know how to secure since plans are falling through repeatedly.",

        "text": "I will admit, I was the 18 year old that would look at my 32 year old self now and think \"she gave up on her dreams\".\n\nBut... I don't feel like I have. Sure, I gave up being in the fast tack to be a mom... but that is because reality hit my dreams and I don't want to work 60-80 hours a week. I want to work 40 hours and actually live my life. That means not getting a 3 pm email on Friday that includes a project that the boss expects to be done at 8 am Monday and having my weekend completely ruined (almost had to give up being in one of my friend's wedding as a bridesmaid). Or night meetings and after-hour social events (which was really just working with the Board and clients and not at all a reward).\n\nPlus, I consider dollars per hour worked. I may be salary, but I still keep track of this calculation. My 40 hour job makes more money per hour than my previous 60-80 hour job. And, even if we top out the salaries using the national average, I'd barely make the same when comparing dollars per hour worked. \n\nSure, I'd like to be something a bit higher, but I'm not willing to give up my life to do it either. I kind of learned that by \"working hard\", they don't mean productivity at all, they mean availability - by that I mean you are available to work 24/7/365. If \"right to disconnect\" becomes a law ever, then maybe I'd go for it, but for right now, I'm ok doing a less prestigious job for slightly less pay to create healthy boundries and disconnect. Because, honestly, the real \"sharks\" or \"lions\" or whatever are the ones who prey on suckers who will give up their entire life for a slightly bigger bread crumb and I'm not into that.\n\nIdk, I'm rambling at this point, but has anyone else done a similar evaluation? Do you feel sad that you gave up what was once your dreams or have you found that those dreams are not the dreams you have now? Or do you feel something different?",

        "text": "I don’t know if this is more of a question or a vent. I met my husband in 2019 and at the time lived a very full life (travel, hobbies, friends, events, etc). \n\nAt the time, my husband (then boyfriend) had recently changed roles at his job and also had a lot of time for hobbies and would indicate to me how even tho his job can be demanding, his focus was on family and quality of life and that would remain important to him. \n\nThen the pandemic hit and we got married in 2020. This is important because since last year now that things are “normal” my husband is always at work. With his travel schedule this year, he’ll be gone almost 5 months of the year and more then 6 next year (not all at once). When he is home he is often answering work calls/texts and mostly likes to talk about his work. While I did expect one longer stint of travel once in our relationship, this is so different than what I expected or would have ever agreed to. \n\nMy husband has recently (over the last 6-8 months) really stepped up contributing to the housework but I’m just so lonely in our marriage. This is important because he has made positive changes and I don’t want to be discouraging to that by having complaints. I also have a stepchild (10) and my husband refuses to go on dates/get child care for anything other than work when we have them. This isn’t something I want to be pushy about, but it’s hard when during the school year 2 weekends are for stepchild, one is for work, and one is (sort of) for me. During the summer we’ll have them for longer periods of time which used to hurt my feeling we couldn’t get a sitter for a date in that time, but I try to just let it go now. Really it’s work that I feel shouldn’t take priority, even if I do wish we could get a sitter sometimes, I don’t think that’s really the problem. Previous summers (and until last spring on the weekends we had SC) I had also been doing childcare for SC at least half the time we had them. \n\nOur marriage counselor essentially told me that this isn’t going to change and I have to find ways to cope. But I feel like some responsibility should be on my husband for taking on so many commitments? Am I at out of line? What would you do?\n\nThis icing on the cake this week was Valentine’s Day. We both had the evening off and originally I had wanted to just stay in and hang out, but he switched days to keep SC that day because he would be out of town for work on their normal day. I’m not super big into the holiday so while I was a little disappointed, it wasn’t a big deal. We normally don’t do anything major, but I usually make him a cute card and a small gift. I’ve toned it down over the years because it’s not always reciprocated so instead of making a card and everything I just got him a sweet treat with a little note on the box. I’ve told him so many times I’d be happy with just a handwritten note or that I wish I had more momentos to look at all the times he’s gone, but I got nothing this year. And after dropping off SC Tuesday evening he drove to his work trip that night so that he wouldn’t have to wake up early and drive in the morning. \n\nAm I crazy for feeling like I want more than that? Am I being selfish or is this something I don’t see?  \n\nIs our marriage counselor right that I should just accept this?",

However, as time went on, I learned more about myself and about love, and I now have a whole new way of thinking about love.\n\nFirst, I realized that love needs to be based on honesty and trust. This was the key to my failure with my ex-husband. We weren't really honest and open with each other, and we didn't build enough trust. As a result, when relationship problems arose, we were unable to resolve them, which ultimately led to our breakup. Now, I am more concerned about building real connection and trust, which is the key to a strong relationship.\n\nSecond, I have learned to better understand my own needs and expectations. In my past marriage, I often gave up my own needs and expectations in order to accommodate the other person's expectations and needs. This was a huge mistake for me. Now, I pay more attention to my own needs and expectations and look for people who can actually meet those needs.\n\nFinally, I have learned to face the challenges and difficulties in my relationship. In our past marriage, we experienced many difficulties and challenges, but we couldn't handle them. Now, I have learned how to build open communication and problem-solving skills in my relationship. I believe that when I meet the next person, I will be able to handle the problems and challenges in my relationship better.\n\nAll in all, the divorce was a painful experience, but I learned a lot about myself and my love.
