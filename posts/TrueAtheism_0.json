        "text": "I was raised in a Christian household with my parents and two older siblings. All of us believed in the conception of God described in the Bible. Religion was mandatory. During my childhood, my mother and father were evangelist. They prayed, they spoke in tongues, caught the ‚ÄúHoly Ghost‚Äù, went to church revivals and much more. My father used to make staves like the prophets in the Bible. He preached and prophesied often. He even recorded cassette tapes to deliver his messages. My parents made me go to a religious private school when I was a boy. After my parents divorced, I continued to live with my mother and two older sisters. Religion was still a prominent influence in our lives. \n\n\nMy mother and siblings attended church and had a strong faith in the Bible. I did not. The Bible never made sense to me. I never felt a connection with the scriptures. I have always disagreed with Christianity. I never took the Bible seriously, however, my family did take it very seriously. \n\n\nAs I became an adult, I developed a deep resentment towards revealed religion. I wanted to rebel against it. I investigated various topics on the supernatural. I abandoned the beliefs that I was taught as a child. I was never convinced that people believed in Jesus or God as much as they claimed to. I thought they were actors pretending to be redeemed. I began to make observations towards peoples behavior. After church was over, these so called holy people were judgmental, hypocritical, and condescending. I was completely turned off by this. No matter how many articles of faith I read, I was never convinced to believe. \n\n\nEventually, I became a self-proclaimed atheist. I decided not to subscribe to blind faith. I had a desire to discover my own way of life. For many years, I kept my views and opinions on religion away from my family. I let go of the fear of God sending me to a lake of fire for eternity. \n\n\nI have not seen a demonstration that proves God exist. I do not believe there is a supernatural power that intervenes in our lives. I do not believe the Bible is God‚Äôs authority. I do not believe Jesus Christ is the son of God. The Bible is fictitious. In my opinion, there is not sufficient evidence to prove the stories written in the Bible are true. I am an agnostic. I do not know whether or not a supernatural power exist. I do not believe claims of divine revelation in revealed religion. Organized religion is a hoax. People say that God exist because a book said so. To me, this is not sufficient. The Bible is disassociated with reality. If God exist, then he is either not all-loving, or not all-powerful. Neither of these have been demonstrated. \n\n\nRegardless of my opinions, I believe that every individual has a right to decide what is true to them. I respect the insight and perspective of other people. I have learned to agree to disagree with those who do not share my views.",

        "text": "Logic and evidence are among the central concerns of atheism. No logic or evidence stands in a particularly interesting relationship to theism. Inasmuch as lack of evidence undermines or weakens the belief in a \"god,\" why does it not undermine or weaken atheism? With the incessant search for evidence, we would have to be solipsists, or worse, skeptics who disbelieve in the existence of everything\n\nWe could never have sufficient evidence for the existence of ourselves, other people, or the world around us. The beliefs we hold on to, such as the reliability of our senses or the uniformity of the world around us, are not evidentially grounded. It is not possible to establish evidentially that our senses are not misleading or tricking us, as there would be no other way apart from our sensory experience to prove this. To rely on our senses to prove this would beg the question \n\nScience and atheism function within a paradigm of assumptions. They assume the reliability of perception or sensory experience. Different theories result in different perceptual data. And there are no neutral perceptual data against which to check the reliability of a theory; therefore, science and atheism would be as biased and dogmatic as theism \n\nIf you disagree, could you please explain to me the difference between belief in the existence of a \"god\" and belief in the existence of ourselves, other people and the world around us? How can we prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that we exist, other people exist, the Earth is round, etc? That we aren't, say, in a matrix or simulation? That everything we see or feel is accurate?",

However, there was this one guy that said in his live that negative claim can be proven but harder than the positive one and did not explain why so I am asking all of you if you know what he is talking about. In my opinion if it is an ordirary negative claim like I dont own a house, it can be proven very easily, but when it comes to extraordinary negative claims like I believe in a god, I do not see the point cause it is not possible to prove or disprove...that's why I think that agnostic atheist is the best way to call myself.",

When it‚Äôs Old Testament people, rape and genocide are ok, (how loving).\n\nThis leads me to a question, is there a scripturally solid argument you could make that the Bible condemns interracial relationships? \n\nIf you can make that case, is it also logical to say that from a biblical perspective, the Bible condemns interracial relationships as much as gay ones? Or does it condemn one more than it condemns the other, in your view.\n\nThe reason I ask, is evangelical used to be really really against interracial couples, and desegregation, and I find it difficult to believe that it was based off them just interpreting the Bible completely wrong.

This morning i see a discussion about Pro-Lifers who wants to make law in the USA (i'm french) that would ban abortion and punish by death penalty those who would abort anyway... Typical stupid and awful pro-lifers...  \nAnyway, in the comments, i see someone who says something like \"they don't care about saving lives, they just want to control women\"... I am not convinced by this logic. I know many men want to control women, i know religion does too, but i don't think on this particular matter, controlling women is really the reason behind the scene... Maybe i'm wrong... i was expecting other redditors who may disagree with me to just tell me why they would think i'm wrong...\n\nInstead of that, i was just massively downvoted... it's not a big deal since downvotes or upvotes are not that important to me... but it made me realise that what i said may have been misunderstood, that maybe they thought i was a pro-life or something like that... So i just posted another comment asking if what i said in the previous comment was misunderstood... I did not insult anyone, i did not troll, i just asked what they hated so much about my comment to see if there was\n\nAs a result, i was permanently banned. And the mod told me i was a bigot. Obviously they thought i was pro-life which is very far from what i am....\n\nAnyway, the goal of that post is not to bash on this subreddit, but i just do not undertand what happened...  \nI tried to communicate with the mod that banned me, i even sent an appeal, and now i was just muted... That's totally absurd...\n\nDid it ever happen to one of you?",

The point of the post was to build a collection of examples to cite when theists allege that there is a deity that punishes people for being evil even in this world (and not just in a fictional afterlife). \n\nHowever, I got banned from the subreddit without any reason being offered. I was given the option to appeal after reading three lengthy rules-related posts and one about \"how to construct an appeal.\" The last one basically required you to do a Soviet-style self-criticism session in which you prostrate yourself, convict yourself and beg for forgiveness.\n\nAnyway, I read through these documents and did not see how I violated any rule. I said so, and added that I do not offer an apology because I did not do anything wrong. The mods then accused me of not reading the rules. That wasn't true, so I said so and asked for confirmation if this was really the post I was banned for. They then said that no reasonable person could think my post was acceptable if they read the rules and called me a liar. I protested and told them that I was a lawyer, and that it is a generally accepted principle of natural justice that one should be told what rule they violated and why action was taken against them, and it shouldn't be for the accused to make the case of the prosecution to seek a relief. They called me a liar again and muted me.\n\nIs this a common experience? I deconverted about two years ago and am quite disappointed to see such egotistic characters ruling the roost in my new community. I am just as much of an atheist as any other, and I had hoped fellow atheists would hold to higher ethical standards. \n\nMy apologies if I am not allowed to say any of this here. I did look at the rules. Please feel free to remove my post but don't ban me because I'd like to be in spaces where there are like minded people. Thanks!",

The question is:\n\nCan inorganic material, given the right conditions, begin forming organic material, and if so, can that material begin doing the things we call \"life\"? While this hasn't been proven quite yet (although I think we are getting close), I don't see any reason to bring up Renee Descartes here. This isn't a philosophical composition question. It's a science question.\n\nLike the stupid Ontological arguments that basically boil down to \"of course god exists! If he didn't, he wouldn't be god!\"",

And the human eye is even more complex, so it must have a designer too.\n\nI always heard a good rebuttal was \"simplicity is the actual indicator of design\" because designed things are never needlessly complex, right? Like, a watch. It has exactly the right number of gears to do its job. No more, no less. It's as simple as it can be, which is a good way know it was designed. Compared to a human who is needlessly complex and has lots of features that don't seem to do anything, which shows that a human wasn't designed by an intelligent agent. Cuz what kind of intelligent agent would give nipples to men?\n\nBut it seems to me that, at most, all I can say for sure is that if humans were designed, it was poor design. That doesn't prove (on its own) that humans aren't designed tho. Imagine if you found a watch with a bunch of extraneous gears and screws that don't do anything. You wouldn't assume it was not designed just cuz it's needlessly complex. What if you found a watch that was so complex it didn't even function as a watch anymore? Would that indicate it wasn't designed by an intelligent agent?\n\nI feel like the simplicity/complexity thing isn't that reliable of an indicator one way or another since I can find simple or complex things that are designed or naturally occurring.",

        "text": "Well, duh, you might say. But I think this represents a wider, more serious problem within anti-intellectual spaces about historical revisionism. \"History is written by the winners\" is a known aphorism, but I don't think enough people consider its implications in full, or the related idea that history is framed by the ideology and biases of the person telling you it.\n\nIt's hard to be neutral, and I won't pretend I'll always be when reporting history, but there's a line between recognizing that, and doing it shamelessly. Worse still is when authority figures do it - growing up in the United Kingdom, the way we were taught history, up until you're doing it at A level, say, which is entirely optional, is extremely Anglocentric. For example, when learning about the Napoleonic Wars, generally all we hear about are the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) and the Battle of Waterloo (1815) because of Britain's involvement and victory, giving the impression that Napoleon had a serious losing streak, despite his near invincibility up until his invasion of Russia. As a result, Britons grow up with a completely distorted view of history, not helped by our current nationalist government attempting to imply that Britain can do so well on its own, and has always done, never mind how much our quality of living is plummeting.\n\nNationalist pseudohistory can have even more egregious results in countries like Japan, Turkey, and Russia. But one variant that rarely gets challenged, probably because of the nearly global stigma of irreligion (and the emphasis of 'cultural Christianity' in heavily irreligious countries) is the historical revisionism that paints non-belief as black as possible. The term 'atheist' itself has historically been used pejoratively, and how often have you heard apologists insist 'Atheist regimes have killed the most people!' It's especially rich when they insist upon looking at the nuances and complexities of conflicts intertwined with religion (which I'd agree with - conflicts are rarely down to just one cause alone), but give the sweeping declaration that any conflict between Marxist-Leninists and anyone else (though they make an exception for World War II, it seems), is 'evil atheists persecuting those poor God-fearing heroes!'\n\nThere are many responses one could put to this - I mean, we could be just as reductionist and play the numbers game too, and point out that the deadliest war of the 19th century (The Taiping Rebellion of 1850-1864) was caused by Christianity and killed between 20-30 million people. Ah, but, the apologists way, that number accounts for all casualties, including those of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and Hong Xiuquan didn't act like any modern Christian, he thought he was Jesus' brother! Sure - there are nuances. So, if we agree with that, why not take the same critical look at the casualties of these so-called 'atheist regimes'?\n\nLet's start with Stalin -  he was an atheist, and the Soviet Union endorsed state atheism. Calculating the exact number of deaths he was responsible for is difficult, due to lack of consensus on exactly what deaths he's responsible for. Before the access of the Soviet archives in the 1990s, estimates were put at around 20 million, but in [2011, historian Timothy D. Snyder suggested that it was closer to 9 million, with 6 million as deliberate killings, based on data accessed since the 90s.](https://www.nybooks.com/online/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/) Now, the link I provided wasn't to the most cast-iron source, it was all I could find in a pinch, but if, as suggested, Stalin's death toll was lower than that of the Taiping Rebellion, should that matter? When it comes to polemics against religion or atheism, shouldn't motivation be more important? Well, the majority of these deaths can be put down to famine, which was caused by the forced collectivization of farms, an ideological action enforced against evidential problems, and one very difficult to argue that atheism was an indispensable part of. Or, in the case of the Holodomor, anti-Ukranian sentiment can be said to play a huge role, something that current leader of Russia has proved is not inherent to atheists either.\n\nAnd what about Stalin's Great Purge, where he disposed of so many political enemies? A good chunk of them were, naturally, also atheists, including Leon Trotsky. Yes, around the 1930s, Stalin also pushed for more persecution of religious workers and organizations as well, but they were just one target of Stalin's paranoia and didn't make up the bulk of his killings. If this needs to be more obvious, consider when Marxist-Leninist states opposed each other, such as the Khmer Rouge's war against communist Vietnam, or indeed when Marxist-Leninist atheist leaders actively relaxed their grip on power to allow for religious freedom (such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Alexander Dubƒçek). There's a lot more nuance here, and the crucial point is that so much of this nuance goes directly against many propagandists' main claim.\n\nIn Peter Hitchens' book *The Rage Against God*, he attempts to make the case that the deaths contributed to Marxist-Leninist states was inevitably linked with their rejection of religion: '(Atheists)   have a fundamental inability to concede that to be effectively absolute, a moral code needs to be beyond human power to alter.' \\[pg. 103\\]. And that 'those who reject God's absolute authority,  preferring their own, are far more ready to persecute than Christians have been...' \\[pg. 113\\]. But this is a complete (and I would argue, deliberate) misreading of the motivation of such killings. It's not because of a lack of a moral code, it's because of one far too rigid, dogmatic, and myopic, which is why it's apt to compare Stalinism with theocracy, more than with secularism.\n\nThis revisionism continues when the French Revolution is discussed - everyone likes to talk about the horrors of the Reign of Terror, including Edward Burke, who liked to cite it as an example of the evils of any revolution, conveniently forgetting that there was a whole host of reasons for the unpopularity of the Ancien R√©gime, among many people of diverse opinions, and that Robespierre was neither an atheist nor a secularist, advocating the implementation of his deistic cult as the state religion. When discussing the French Revolution, too many people also miss out on how revolutionary France was the first European state to give Jews equal rights as citizens in 1794 (perhaps because modern advocates of so-called Judeo-Christian values like to pretend that Judaism and Christianity always lived in harmony), or the disgusting actions of the theocratic Bourbon Restoration under Charles X (not the first Bourbon monarch), a believer in divine right, who advocated press censorship, the death penalty for sacrilege, reduced the franchise, and a war against Algeria that many modern commentators have considered genocide. History is imperfect, humans are imperfect, and their regimes are imperfect. The lack of fundamental difference between overtly religious, non-religious, and anti-religious regimes is in the favour of atheism, I feel, as it seems to suggest no divine hand is over anything.\n\nBeing able to dissect this propaganda with knowledge is vital, given the persecution of the irreligious continues today - when different religions do get along, it's usually to target the godless (and anything they see as part of that, including sexual freedom, freedom of conscience, and rights for LGBTQ people) - both the Kremlin and Chechnya will view the war in Ukraine as a holy war against the godless West, just using different religions to justify it.\n\nTo defend the godless, we need to embrace inquiry, nuance, knowledge, and the access to it, as well as acknowledge we always have more to learn than we might realize. It's the way we combat the ignorance and prejudice inherent to historical revisionism.",

I could understand how boiling a frog in a pot could lead otherwise normal people to enact the atrocities like the holocaust.\n\nBut with all we've learned, humanity hasn't progressed.  We still have a substantial population of people, who could morally justify infanticide, if it was commanded by a trusted authority.   All in the name of avoiding cognitive dissonance. \n\nAnd those people have the gall to claim that atheists lack morals...sheesh..",

All the efforts are wasted if the direction is wrong and the post of Director is very important in any institution since he gives right direction to all for its success. The right direction is always given by the true spiritual knowledge enlightened with perfect analysis in all directions. The identification must be related to serve your important need. Hence, the Veda says that the only identification is the excellent spiritual knowledge (Prajnaanam), which is true (Satyam) and elaborate due to perfect analysis (Anantam). The Gita also says that God will enter directly in preaching spiritual knowledge (Jnaaniitvaatmaiva), which is very delicate and can be easily twisted for misinterpretation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou need not worry about other defects found in Him since such defects in human form of God have their own program like repelling undeserving devotees, becoming close to defective people for their uplift, testing the faith of true devotees etc. Even if the preacher is a human being only, you need not worry about his defects since he will be punished by nature or God for his defects. You have approached a doctor for the cure of disease in your lungs. The doctor advised you to stop smoking immediately. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe doctor is also observed by you while smoking. You shall not reject the doctor and his advice saying that how a doctor, himself smoking, advice you to stop smoking! The doctor will be punished by the laws of nature for his smoking and he shall be worried more about it being a doctor! Why shall you spoil your health by leaving that doctor, who is an excellent specialist for lungs? Perhaps, you are telling like this to continue your smoking!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Veda also speaks about two other identifications by saying that i) God is embodiment of love (Raso vai sah) in order to encourage the devotion of devotees and ii) God can do any miracle (Satyakaamah) to give proof to atheist if He feels that he can be reformed by a miracle. A demon does miracles to project himself with ego and such miracle is also from the grace of God only expressed for his rigid devotion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n A cheat does false miracles or magic to impress innocent devotees to cheat them. These two wrong sides are absent in God. He does miracles often to help spiritual progress of deserving devotees and not for His self-projection in fame and not for cheating the innocent devotees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHuman incarnation is the most relevant form of God for the humanity here and every human being is missing God here due to ego and jealousy towards co-human forms based on repulsion between common media (human body of God and human body of human being). The same soul goes to upper worlds after leaving this gross body and entering a new energetic body. In the upper worlds, the most relevant form of God is energetic body. Due to the same repulsion between common media (energetic body of God and energetic body of human soul), the soul misses God there also. As a result, the soul misses God always and everywhere. If the soul wants success in Nivrutti, it should avoid ego and jealousy towards common medium. To achieve this, the soul shall participate in the service of humanity treating every human form as God.",

        "text": " Perhaps I am making an unfair comparison but recently I came across this [article](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/interview-taliban/) about an interview a journalist had with the Taliban and it made me experience substantial anxiety. I was again reminded that these kinds of movements are highly prevalent throughout the world and will use violence time and time again to impose their version of what society ought to be which involves degrading women, lgbt+ people, atheists, and people of other faiths as second-class citizens. Moreover, it's not just Islam that promotes such values. Christianity is also a significant danger to society and must be oppressed. We have seen this to be the case with Roe V. Wade and how they also attempt to turn atheists and LGBT+ individuals into second-class citizens. They are also very anti-education as they try to stop schools from teaching science. Therefore, Christianity is just as dangerous as Islam and must be eliminated as well.\n\nBecause of promoting this form of oppression, it's crucial that we fight back against all forms of Abrahamic religions to protect these individuals from being oppressed. Therefore, I actually would support policies that imprison leaders of all forms of Abrahamic religions to protect other cultures because Abrahamic religions dominate and will eventually seek to eliminate those who do not embody the values that the religion attempts to impose. In contrast, other religions such as Buddhism, Taoism, or Shintoism do not seek to impose their way of life onto others and Abrahamic religions in fact try to eliminate these minority religions. Because of this, there cannot be human rights if Abrahamic religions continue they exist, these religions must be eliminated through the greatest amount of force possible.",

        "text": "Henotheism: adherence to one particular god out of several, especially by a family, tribe, or other group.\n\nThe reason why this is a game-changer, in my opinion, is because it perfectly describes the transition from Judaism to Christianity. Basically, it makes it painfully obvious that we're looking at a man-made religion which was affected by cultural changes, just like the rest of them. More importantly, it demonstrates that Christianity does **NOT** have monotheistic roots; rather, the origin chain goes polytheism--henotheism--monotheism. Pretty much everyone rejects polytheism these days. So, knowing that the originators were polytheistic should discredit the later-turned-monotheistic religion known as Christianity. Remember reading about Elohim in Genesis and wondering why it basically means plural gods?\n\nThe TL;DR is that Yahweh was a tribal/regional god to the Israelites. They accepted that plenty of other gods existed, but they chose to only worship only him. The origins of Christianity are literally just the boring and typical \"our real god versus your real god, but ours is stronger or likes us better.\" Remember when they lost the battle because the enemies had iron chariots? Classic Old Testament story. (*\"The LORD was with the men of Judah. They took possession of the hill country, but they were unable to drive the people from the plains, because they had chariots fitted with iron.\"*) I guess Yahweh wasn't strong enough to defeat the iron chariots. Eventually, all of the other 'real' gods became 'false idols' and after many generations, you find yourself with monotheism.\n\nHere's something I found online that I wanted to share. I find it does a much better job at explaining everything:\n\nAll archaeological evidence points to the Israelites having been a tribe among the Canaanites that developed a cult of worship around El Elyon, the creator god of the Canaanite Pantheon. They believed that by pooling all of their offerings and prayers into the worship of a single deity, rather than spreading them out amongst multiple Gods, their tribe would be singularly granted favor by this deity. By worshiping only one god, their tribe self-organized itself into a monotone culture that saw itself separate from the other tribes. They managed to expand their rule across the whole region before being defeated by the Persian Empire and sent into exile in Babylon.\n\nTo prevent their people from merging into Persian culture and society, the Levites, who acted as priests and scholars within Israelite society, drafted a revision of Israelite history using stories from different cultures that they came in contact with while in exile as templates. This revision is where the story of Exodus originated from. This revised history gave the Israelites a way to feel separate from Persian society and prevented them from losing their cultural identity until they were finally allowed to return to their homeland from exile many years later when Cyrus the Great came to power in Persia. This period in Israelite history shows stark differences to Israelite culture before their time in exile.\n\nAll the lower gods from the Canaanite Pantheon were seen as false idols in the eyes of their god, now called Yahweh, rather than rivals to him. This transformation may be the first example in history of the emergence of a monotheistic society.",

If I open a brand new deck of cards and discover that they are all in order, is this truly the most improbable event of all time, or do all brand new decks of cards come in order?\n\nSecond, if you want to necessitate a fine tuner for the existence of life, you must also demonstrate that some proportion of all possible universes would result in one where life was impossible. Which parameters of the universe are able to be changed, and by what increments? Which ranges of parameters allow life and which don't? \n\nTl;dr *Without being able to substantiate the claim that the universe is even tunable and that it requires tuning for life, the fine-tuning argument fails.*",

First I was a soft agnostic, most likely out of fear. I kept it to myself for a long time, maybe mentioning here or there that l don't really believe in the presence of Gods. As I've gotten older I have shifted to fully embracing atheism, but lately I am struggling.  I feel... wrong for not believing.  So many others do. I cannot shake this feeling of maybe they're right? What am I missing? It makes me uncomfortable.  A neighbor asked me today if I believed in God and when I told her no she took it very personally and blamed my life problems on my lack of faith... but that can't be right.  I still don't believe but I feel like I'm doing something wrong for not being faithful. I believe more in faith of the self.  I believe we are the Gods of our own beings.. if that makes sense. I don't know I feel like I'm rambling.  This may just be religious trauma flaring up that I did not realize I had.  Has anyone else felt this way?",

It is also full of historically revisionism, denying that Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were deists as well, even though they had made that clear in their private works and statements. Any talk about freedom they made is false, they are in the tradition of the Puritans who claimed to come to America for religious freedom from the Church of England, only to go hang Quakers, execute \"witches\", and harass Catholics. They are cut from the same cloth as the Puritans back in England who when they seized power during the English Civil War immediately began to use the power of the state to force their religious beliefs on everyone else. \n\nChristian nationalists claim to love the American constitution, but they hate the actual meaning of it, starting right with the first amendment. They reject the separation of church and state, which is the foundation of freedom of religion. They instead profess the doctrine that America is a \"Christian nation\". And of course it is their particular brand of Christianity. Freedom of the evils of state religion is one of the great gifts our forefathers gave us, men have to fight and die and use the means of muskets, cannons, and bayonets to rid themselves of this evil here in America and in much of Europe. Their ideology is anti Enlightenment, they want to repress us back to an inferior social order centuries dead,",

This is just something that really bothers me.\n\nA couple months back I was scrolling through social media and I stumbled upon a couple of posts from a Muslim couple discussing homosexuality and trans issues.\n\nThey were answering a question on homosexuality in Islam and if they supported it. They said that they didn't judge people on their sexuality or gender identity. Okay, so far so good. Then they go on to say that gay people can be Muslim but since it was a sin in Islam that they cannot act on their urges.\n\nI am bisexual and trans and this really rubbed me the wrong way because doesn't this directly contradict their previous statement? You can't say that gay people are allowed to be Muslim, then turn around and say that \"Oh, but they just can't act on it.\" That is a homophobic statement no matter which way you twist it.\n\nFurthermore, they claim not to be homophobic, yet the husband says that he refuses to live with his uncle because he's gay and it would be sinful.\n\nThere are also a couple instances of them reducing trans people down to their biology.\n\nIt's not even just isolated in Islam I see this everywhere in Organized religions, especially those which are monotheistic. I mainly see these kinds of statements echoed in Christianity, Catholicism, Mormonism, and in Jehovah's witnesses\n\nIt's awful that most organized big religions are homophobic and transphobic, but it irks me even more when they try and mask it with statements like \"Gay people are welcome but the act isn't.\" Or the ever famous \"love the person hate the sin.\"\n\nLike mate, just say that your religion hates gay people point blank.

However, in the second account, it states that God created man first and then woman later. \"The Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.

        "text": "    If we move through one of the known spatial dimensions, we come to understand that each object occupies a finite amount of space. As we move along one dimension, the object will stop taking up space, and eventually fade from view. Still, even though we cannot detect it with any of our senses, we know that it is still there. This is the concept of object permanence, which we learn at a young age.\n\n    I think of the time dimension in much the same way. Our lives occupy a very small amount of space in the grand timeline of the universe. At one point, we are alive, experiencing all that life has to offer, and making an impact on the world whether good or bad. As time goes on, we die. Our deeds live on a bit longer, but eventually, our impact fades until it is indistinguishable from the rest of humanity. But does this mean that our lives were meaningless? Absolutely not. I believe our lives, like objects in space, remain unchanged in the universal timeline. Just because two separate points in time are unable to interact with each other doesn't mean the previous point is meaningless. It's still there, it's every bit as real as any other point in time. So if something is gone, it's not really gone. It remains frozen, unchanged, for all eternity. \n\n\n_\"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened\"_ - Dr. Seuss",

        "text": "Now to start off I have nothing bad to say about Atheists.\n\n  I am also going to be talking about controversial topics or anything that comes to mind that people might not know or need to be cleared on about, so this might not be for everybody lol\n\nI firstly wanna apologize on behalf of Christians because I know the majority are very annoying and can be very \"follow God or you'll go to hell\" like and not to just atheists but just in general. I am an orthodox Christian, so I go by the book (KJV). Anything I read or hear or see on TV or Social Media, I instantly go to the book because there are A LOT of preachers or idols of Christianity who don't know what their talking about and spread lies which leads to hateful Christians which is very shameful. I want to clear up a few things that some people might not know and it even took me a while to understand. I'm going to talk as a Christian so like \"sins\" and \"God\" and all that, sorry if it's gonna sound annoying lol. Everyone Sins. God sees Lying and Murder as a sin so no other is more worse. The most controversial topic is Gay and Christianity, this is the thing being gay isn't a sin; the Bible basically says men can't sleep with another man or 2 women and women can't sleep with each other nor with 2 men. It's a sin but so is Lying, Sex before Marriage, Adultery, etc. I believe people just pushed on the gay subject so much because back then it wasn't a topic people liked and they twisted the words and it's one of those things that have built up over the years and is still a topic that people argue over which is sad. Christians are supposed to be good and loving people but the religion and its people(not all but most) have forgotten what that means. I understand people don't like us talking about our religion because it's as if we're forcing it on you and although some might actually be doing that, some of us just want to give you the important information and that's it; also I do agree that Christians should ask before telling someone about the religion. The \"important Information\" is like this, I'll give an example, I usually play games and talk to people and would ask if anyone wants to hear some things about Christianity and if they don't want to then we play the game until it's over and if they want to hear then I tell them a few stories and the whole \"getting saved\" thing. That's it. After that I'm done and I don't do this everyday lol. The whole \"Follow God or you'll go to Hell\" thing is very annoying even to me because it's weird how the only way to get people to follow Christianity is by scaring them, I don't do that and I know others don't either. The whole thing about falls back to sin and if we don't \"repent\" then we won't be saved; repenting is basically believing in your heart that Jesus rose from the dead and that Jesus is the son of God and you basically ask for forgiveness, but you have to mean it with your heart and if you just say it to say it then you aren't saved lol. If you are a murderer and repent and MEAN it with your heart and not out of fear, you'll be saved and if you have slept with the same sex then you repent and believe it then you are also saved. It's weird but yeah. I also wanna talk about the whole \"proof\" thing about Christianity. There IS some proof of Christianity like Chariot wheels in the Red sea from when Moses was helping Isrealites escape Egypt when he parted the red sea, there's proof Jesus was real(that he was a real person, not that he was supernatural being but he was a real person), Dead Sea Scrolls, and some other stuff I'm sure is out there but I cannot confirm is real or not. Also even if all the \"proof\" of Christianity was fake, Christians still have to have faith and as some people might see it as \"a kid believing in Santa\" because that's basically right. There might not be 101% accurate evidence or proof at all but the faith thing is what keeps some or most Christians going. I believe Christians and Society could get together and be peaceful if the majority of Christianity learned boundaries and were taught correctly and if everyone didn't judge Christians based on all their past interactions. I've been told I am wrong by a Muslim and yet I treat all religions with respect, I've been cussed at by LGBTQ community people and told to die by them and yet I treat all with respect and even have friends who are apart of that community,¬† I have been made fun of by atheists for believing in a fairy tale and yet I am here with the utmost respect and in hopes I haven't upset yall or annoyed yall too much and I have atheists friends. My point is just to judge the person, not the whole community or religion and that doesn't just go for Christianity but for all religions and all communities and all groups. We would progress so far if people stopped judging others based on what they align themselves with. I believe that's all I gotta clear up and say and discuss and if you read this far, Thank you. If you have any questions or opinions I'm free to chat about it all. Thanks for letting me discuss this topic here and I hope you all have a great day and sorry if I was being annoying at parts but I guess it comes with the title lol.¬†‚ù§Ô∏è\n\n(Also sorry if I misspelled anything or if my punctuation is bad, I am re-watching The Office and kinda distracted)",

Just wanted to hear the community‚Äôs response to these questions and how they would refute them from people more knowledgeable than I am. \n\n1) The Big Bang: How can nothing explode and produce everything? \n\n2) The Formation of Stars: How can exploding matter come together to form stars and galaxies and planets?\n\n3) The Origin of Life: How can life come from non-life?\n\n4) The Diversity of Life: How can natural selection (genetic information loss) and mutations (genetic information corruption) produce evolution (genetic information gain)?\n\n5) Mind and Morality: How can such non-material things arise from material things?\n\nI hope this prompts good discussion.
