Do you know what they call 'alternative medicine' that's been proved to work? Medicine.\"\n\nBy this definition, entire cultures are practicing Gua Sha (known as Kerokan in Indonesia and Cao Gio in Vietnam) and therefore human society knows it as having some kind of effect. In addition, the research shows that unlike other alternative medicines like Homeopathy, there are some clear effects on the human body.\n\nMy friend argues that the effects aren't necessarily there and are founded by belief (placebo). He also argues that if the effects aren't completely clear yet, then it shouldn't be advertised as medicine - although again, I'd argue that since many cultures are doing it, they'd know the effects and when to use it.\n\nBottom line is, I feel like I've reached a stalemate and can't really decide between either viewpoints.

Should be taught nowhere. I’ll gladly debate you on the topic. Even considering your profession. As far as anti vaccine, there are lots of peer reviewed papers questioning the safety of vaccines. None that show any testing on animals to prove its safety  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**My claim:**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Go ahead, debate me. For starters, can I ask you how do you explain antibiotic resistance if Darwinian Evolution is garbage?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**His claim:**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Because epigenetic processes are responsible for the initial adaptive change...bacteria have a reversible phenotype that gets triggered by the environment they are in...specifically in this case, antibiotics triggers a quick, non-random adaptive and heritable increase in resistance. Mutation happens afterwards after the adaptive trait is conferred, and cannot explain the emergence of resistance. There is also the fact that most resistances occur via horizontal gene transfer. Which is another non-random neo-lamarckian, non Darwinian process.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**My claim:**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;That is all wrong. To develop antibiotic resistance, there should be diversity within the population, traits which can be selected for. When antibiotics are used, it kills off a certain percentage of the organism, the percentage dependent on the dose. If you use a dose too low, some die, but those who survive can survive that low dose.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;This is also why eugenics is bad - because something might come along that kills all humans except those with a certain trait - and we don't know what the future brings.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**His claim:**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;no, it's not all wrong. I've got the paper to prove it. Yes, there is variation in a bacterial population, but this is by design. Just as a baseball team spreads out across the field in different positions to catch a potential ball hit off the bat of the hitter, bacteria fan out genetically to help field any potential environmental threats. But this does not negate that the epigenetic processes happen quickly and first, before the mutations. The epigenetic processes are what confers the initial adaptive change and allows the population to survive. Mutations come later, but are probably triggered by the epigenetics. Epigenetics also come before mutations in cancer....in fact, most mutations have an epigenetic trigger. The science has changed. Darwin is left out in the cold. again. Lamarck will end up steamrolling darwin before its over. you watch.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**My claim:**   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Epigenics is real, it's quick and it's reversible. But mutations are slower and rarer. By all means, send me the paper.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Mutations do happen all the time. Many diseases are due to mutation, but some mutations don't cause any harm at all. But sometimes new selective pressures arise that select for these mutations. Species are not fanning out deliberately, they fan out naturally and some variations turn out to be detrimental.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This doesn't leave Darwin in the cold because the power of epigenetics is limited. For example, Darwin's finches slowly diverged from a single ancestor, but while epigenetics can quickly give adaptations, the finches can't come back to the ancestral form anymore because their mutations created distinct species which can't interbreed. Only mutants suited to a certain environment can survive, and selective pressures deleted the other variations in that environment.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**His claim:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118464](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118464)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;as far as the finches go, epigenetics probably explains that too. Of course mutation may be involved with some beak variants but the vast majority of adaptive morphological changes seem to be epigenetic. [https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/press-centre/science-press-releases/24-08-17](https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/press-centre/science-press-releases/24-08-17)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The very interesting thing that has come about in the past couple years is that epigenetic changes seem to induce mutations....sometimes specific mutations which are tied to adaptive processes. The paradigm that science has been adhering to for the past many decades is upside down. DNA is almost always a follower -- it's epigenetics that is the leader. This is the case in antibiotic resistance, cancers, and many other instances. The driver is almost always upstream and non-genetic, usually induced by a specific environmental threat. One researcher said: \"“There’s not a type of genetic mutation known that’s not potentially influenced by environmental epigenetic effects.” It seems there is an interplay between genetics and epigenetics that has not been appreciated until recently.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[https://epigenie.com/epigenetics-drives-genetics-straight-into-evolution-2/](https://epigenie.com/epigenetics-drives-genetics-straight-into-evolution-2/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have reached the limits of my knowledge - should I concede defeat?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

An extremely advanced civilization decides it wants to \"mechaform\" an entire planet, to turn it into a heavily shielded construction facility for moons or massive spaceships. \n\nThe specifics for \"why\" are just distractions: They have any level of technology they need, the physical laws of their universe match ours, and they want a big hollow sphere with walls hundreds to thousands of km thick, massive enough to live on the outer surface.\n\nThey do not have unobtanium or other implausibly strong materials, so this would quickly collapse on itself if left unpowered.\n\nAssuming the engineering know-how and resources, could such a structure be kept from collapsing by pumping fast moving matter through multiple pipelines running around the entire inside circumference of the planet? (Like a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop, but much bigger.)\n\nAre there any other options besides ridiculously strong electromagnets or deciding they can invent antigravity?",

I wonder if in a heat death scenario this would still occur on a universal scale, which would seem like we have an effective singularity again without an actual collapse, and at the final moment of maximum entropy it would trigger another big bang.

Not your own business, nothing about nonprofits. I'd like to talk about and refine my plans here and also receive some critical or general feedback.\n\nSo I wouldn't be where i am today without my education. I wouldn't have been avle to do the things i do etc. One big push into this idea was watching \"living in a dollar per day\". The thought that a kid can't even dream about going to school, much less be anything other than a beat farmer, is devastating to me.\n\nI also grew up in a pretty rural area, and with that comes cultural stuff and denial of essential scientific laws and theories. Not to mention the quality of education and access isn't great either.\n\nSo this project isnt just for developing areas, it's for any kid that wants to do more, or just wants to learn.\n\nI know a multipronged approach will be necessary but for now one big challenge to me is getting education to kids in extremely rural areas like parts of Nepal, or northern Africa, even some places in the US.\n\nWorking with someone like dotLearn and Khan Academy i really think it could happen, but I'm not sure where best to start.\n\nRight now I'm studying Electrical engineering with focus on renewable energy, mostly to help power some areas so they can get a satellite feed when other methods are not feasible.\n\nSadly I don't know of any org that's already doing this, but there are pieces that could come together to make a whole. Spacex's satellite network plan, khan Academy, dotLearn, maybe even IEEE global classroom.\n\nRight now my plan is to go do a tour with the peace corps after i graduate because it seems like the closest thing i can find right now.\n\nI'd appreciate any kind of feedback or guidance on any of this.

I imagine that since iron is significantly denser than all silicates, effectively no matter their temperature difference, the liquid outer portion of cores would undergo convection separate from the silicate mantle, and therefore have no visible effect on tectonics? that said, subducted plates scrape across the 'surface' of the core, and a larger core generally means a thinner mantle.

Have we been able to narrow down the window somewhat reliably? About 5 million years after the Big Bang the light became too dim to be seen with by the naked eye.\n\nI'm also unsure about the following estimates, could someone please check them for me?   \n\n1. Hydrogen could first form 56,000 years after the Big Bang when the universe was ~9000 degrees.   \n\n2. Helium could form when it reached ~3000 degrees around 380,000 years after the Big Bang.  \n\nI'm particularly dubious that helium could form right around when the universe became transparent.

        "text": "Inflation is what we call when the universal force divided and they pushed off each other. The field stretched every point in space out from each other trillions x trillions of times. The microscopic spot that contains all the stuff we can see today (now a horizon with a diameter of 93 billion light-years) ended up about the size of a beach ball. Inflation ended micro-moments after the Big Bang.  \n\nThen what we call expansion continued to make space more roomy.\n\nFor the first 47,000 years it was dominated by radiation until enough had transformed into matter.  \n\nThen for 9 billion years (I'd appreciate it if anyone know how much we've narrowed down the date) matter drove the process.  \n\nFor the last 5 billion years since Dark Energy tipped the scales and came to dominate expansion. (Because as space keeps stretching out the density of matter decreases but dark energy's density stays pretty much the same).\n\n1. If more space = more dark energy then the *acceleration* of the rate of expansion will accelerate and in billions of years [~22?] the bonds holding us to together will be overcome and we'll be ripped apart.\n\n2. If dark energy is a constant amount being spread out then expansion may accelerate at a fairly uniform rate and some particles could continue to interact for trillions of trillions of trillions of years. [Neat note: this would mean that light setting out for us now from 16 billion light-years away would eventually be outpaced by space expanding and would never reach us, creating a (shrinking) horizon we could never see across without some fantastical development].\n\n3. If the amount of dark energy is somehow decreasing space could contract into a Big Crunch.\n\nI know that we're putting up some satellites in the 2020's that will let us know if which of those three is likely. I'd like to know if it's fair to say:  \n\n1. During the radiation dominated period the rate of expansion was ______ [accelerating/decelerating] at a _______ [increasing/fairly constant/decreasing] rate.\n\n2. During the matter dominated period 47,000-9,000,000,000 years after the Big Bang the rate of expansion was ______ [accelerating/decelerating] at a _______ [increasing/fairly constant/decreasing] rate.  \n\n3. So far during the dark energy dominated period the rate of expansion has been accelerating at a ______ [increasing/fairly constant] rate.  \n\nBonus points if anyone knows the rate of expansion around the 47,000 or 9 billion year marks. For example today the 93 billion light-year diameter of the area we can see is spreading out at 3.3x the speed of light. [edit: I think in all directions so the result is that sphere's diameter gets ~660,000km larger each second.]",

This created a blockage (the book used the term “cement”), and shut down the engine. Eventually, charged ice particles magnetically adhered to the hull, encasing it in ice. \n\nThe ice part seems far fetched but the ion drive being rendered useless seems plausible to my ignorant brain.
