        "text": "Would it be feasible to refuel an ion thruster (or even cold gas thruster) from the atmosphere? I can think of a couple different ways to potentially do this. \n\nFirst, stay in a very low orbit, say one that would decay in a matter of days. Have one component of the spacecraft gather nitrogen or other gas from the atmosphere, and use it to feed an ion thruster that pushes the gas out the other side. The power would come from solar panels. Could you realistically gather enough gas to exceed drag?\n\nSecond, maintain a stable orbit (e.g., low, medium, or geosynchronous). When you need to refuel the thrusters, run your thrusters to lower the perigee to just barely graze the atmosphere for one orbit. You might need to use a cold gas thruster to lower the orbit in much less than an orbital period. When you pass through the atmosphere, fill up some storage tanks for the cold gas/ion thruster. You can then use that gas to raise the orbit back to the original, hopefully with a net win in propellant.\n\nI haven't seen this approach considered anywhere. That makes me think the math/physics just doesn't work out, but I'd be interested in what the limiting factor is.",

I try to stay drug free, and do a lot of meditation and exercise to help keep my anxiety in some level of control. \n\nThat being said, a really simple trick that’s worked for me when I’m having an anxiety episode is to shift my mind on space and scale.\n\n\nI often compound thoughts and make them larger than they really are - but then I think of the larger picture and how my issues are so meaningless to an extent. The scale of my problems versus the scale of my apartment versus the scale of my neighbourhood versus the scale of my city versus the scale of my state versus the scale of my country versus the scale of my continent versus the scale of the earth versus the scale of our galaxy versus the scale of our universe…something just puts my mind at ease. \n\nI reality my issues, my problems are just a fraction of the size of a grain of sand, if even that, in the larger scale of things.\n\n\nI don’t know, space just puts my mind at ease. Knowing how insignificant my problems are, in reality, puts my mind at ease.",

Just curious how this passing of time would relay back to earth? \n\nAgain, just curious how this hypothetical scenario would work?",

The original image can be found on [NASA website](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2022/nasa-s-webb-takes-star-filled-portrait-of-pillars-of-creation).\n\nFrom filtered image it is easy to visually detect the data density of pictures. The denser data is nominated with more complex color pattern of the nebula on the right. \n\nOne may say that what is the point since the original image is prettier. But there is an argument that not every pretty picture has data density or in other words we cannot detect raw image that is data rich from processed image that is pretty but lost much of its data due to blurring and sharpness filters.\n\nExample of such image is [this processed image](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AVT_Statistical_filtering_algorithm&amp;oldid=1143591760#/media/File:Filt_01Jupiter_image_showing_alteration_to_original.png) of the Jupiter.
