I’m thinking of something quartz with a metal bracelet. \n\nAfter doing some research I settled on Seiko given my price range. I’m a college student who wants to celebrate his upcoming after-graduation job by buying a new watch. Don’t have a lotta money but here’s a watch I really liked after sifting through Seikos essentials collection: \n\nhttps://seikousa.com/products/srk048\n\nI really liked the gold two-tone but I don’t really know if a two tone is considered tacky. I dress very casual and a bit retro so I figured some gold might look good. I don’t really care what people think but I just want to know whether it not too obscene.

        "text": "Been really back into watches over the last few years (like a lot of you, I'm sure), and while I do lust over Tudors and JLCs, the independent watch makers have really grabbed my attention too. Seems like you get not just great bang for the buck from them, but they do things a little different than the big names, because they answer to no one and can do what they want. Got these 2 in my collection, a Christopher Ward C65 Trident GMT Pepsi, and a Zelos Mako V3 Frost Titanium. Took some looking and getting the timing right to get them, but I love them!",
