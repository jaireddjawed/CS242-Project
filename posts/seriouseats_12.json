Here I used extra large eggs, large ice cube, and melted browned butter.\n\nThe second time the dough was also too wet, and the cookies spread more than the first but they were chewier, but still not very chewy. I let the dough rest overnight. I used extra large eggs, large ice cube, and softened browned butter.\n\nThe third time, which I'm doing now, the dough was firmer but still pretty wet, but after 3 nights in the fridge it did set a little. I used large eggs and softened browned butter (82% butterfat) with a smaller ice cube than I used before, since I thought they were the cause of the problem. I baked two batches so far, the first batch I baked at a higher temperature (185¬∞C) as suggested by some to prevent spreading. But they ended up very cakey, so I baked the second batch at the recommended baking temperature. They were still cakey though. The edges are just a bit crispy but other than that, it's basically cookie bread. It also just has a slight mocha taste, with no toffee.\n\nDoes anyone know why this might be happening and what I can do about it? Thank you!",

I always think I know magic when I'm armed with one of these recipes and this one was a pretty epic fail....on 3 ingredients. Ugh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now I know powdered milk is not the same as evaporated milk. LOL.  Man, I remember thinking there is no way in hell this powder was going to turn into a cream... At least I was right on that one.",

        "author": "tempestatic",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/seriouseats/comments/9dq07f/troubleshooting_runny_blueberry_pie/",
        "text": "I made [blueberry pie](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/07/best-blueberry-pie-dessert-recipe.html) and had some mixed results. The crusts turned out well as usual, with a first-time herringbone fun, gorgeous, and delicious even with a false start. The filling turned out runny, though, which was weird since the edges bubbling over were very sticky and reminiscent of a succcessful blackberry cobbler filling also bubbling over in the oven. When the pie cooled, though, and I cut into it, some completely unthickened juice flowed out of the filling and onto the pie plate. I'm more than likely going to just remake the whole thing, but I had some possibilities as to why it turned out the way it did and I want to look for things to pay extra attention to next time.\n\n* High water-to-starch ratio: I'm pretty sure I used the right amount and type of tapioca starch (leftover from the aforementioned cobbler). I went over the total 28 oz of regular (fresh) and wild (frozen) blueberries by maybe 1 oz and squeezed maybe an extra 1/4 to 3/8 oz of lemon juice into the mix. Also, the frozen wild blueberries had some ice around the berries, but that water was accounted for in the total weight.\n\n* Incorrect levels of acid: Like I previously mentioned, I squeezed a bit more lemon juice into the mix than called for. The lemon may also have been a Meyer lemon (it was unmarked in the fridge and I wasn't thinking much), so I don't know if the extra juice or less acidity (assuming sweeter Meyers have less acid?) may have affected the starch gelling.\n\n* Incompletely thawed blueberries: I didn't check, but the wild blueberries may not have been completely thawed when they went into the oven. If they somehow kept the filling temperature lower, I guess that could prevent gelling, though the center of the pie read 213 before I took it out, after almost 1:45 total baking time. Alternatively, maybe some berries reached the temperature and somehow burst after, releasing unthickened juice? Seems unlikely.\n\n* Poor mixing: So looking back through the pie recipe and the blackberry cobbler recipe, I'm seeing the instructions for the latter specify homogenizing all the dry ingredients before tossing in the berries. I weighed out my fresh and frozen blueberries before dumping everything else on top. I thought they were pretty well mixed, and I scraped everything in the bowl into the pie, but I guess if the starch got all clumped up somewhere other parts could be more watery. I'm not sure of this, though, since we're at ~1/3 of the pie consumed, I haven't seen any overly clumpy portions, and the runniness continues with each slice.\n\nIf anything sticks out that I mentioned or forgot, please let me know! Otherwise I might have to make multiples pies to troubleshoot :O",
