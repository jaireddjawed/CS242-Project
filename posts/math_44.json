        "text": "Problem: Suppose that S is a finite set of real numbers with the property that any two distinct elements of S form an arithmetic progression with another element in S. Give an example of such a set with 5 elements and show that no such set exists with more than 5 elements.\n\nFrom: https://imomath.com/othercomp/Irn/IrnMO297.pdf\n\nI’ve been stuck on proving that no such set exists with &gt;5 elements. \n\nI’ve only been able to generalize examples for sets of 5: Let min = 0 and max = x. The set must consist of 0, x/3, x/2, 2x/3, x. I believe this is the only possible configuration for sets of size 5. And so any set with &gt;5 elements must contain another element, y =/= 0, x/3, x/2, 2x/3, x. \n\nAttempt: I thought of of doing a proof by contradiction. Assume there exists a such a finite set of size S &gt; 5 with min element 0 and max element x. Thus, the set must contain y =/= 0, x/3, x/2, 2x/3, x. I think the end goal is to prove that having y generates an infinite number of elements (thus exceeding S), but I’m not quite sure how to prove that.\n\nThis vaguely reminds me of B3 on the 2022 Putnam, which I solved in-contest. I’m wondering if there are any insights from that problem which I can apply here.\n\nNote: Sorry if this is not the right place to post. This is not a homework problem. I just stumbled across it and thought it looked interesting. It’s one of those problems that feels like it’s right at the tip of my tongue yet I have no idea how to approach it.",

I've taken several algebra classes and I'm currently doing research in algebra so I feel much more comfortable in that area but it's been a while since I've done any analysis. I've taken two courses in real analysis but by the time I'm (hopefully) in grad school, it will have been over a year since I'd done any. Are there any books or tips you have for keeping my analysis skills sharp? I had the idea to work through a more rigorous book, like one of Rudin's texts, but perhaps there's a better method of approach. Let me know what you think. Thanks!",
