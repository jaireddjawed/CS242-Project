        "text": "So gonna skip the long into, this is in response to several people asking for a followup on [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8m1tl1/no_we_dinosaurs_use_stone_tablets_thank_you/) story. My generic intro is there, so I will jump right on in!\n\nThis will be done in story format, speaking roles will be $Me, as myself, $VP as the apparently pretty cool VP of my branch, $BB as Big Boss, also known as my boss. All other roles will be played by $SN for snarky manager(s). \n\nSo the thread basically exploded today. A whole host of $SNs were crawling on this from start of day til the time I walked out. Nothing was directed at me in the e-mail chain after about 8-9 am so my attention was purely educational. \n\nAt the start, it was focused around making sure the office was happy. Obviously the owner was displeased that 'nothing was fixed', and this is a high profile office. Much hemming and hawwing was done. Discounts were discussed, comped on site services, alll sorts of goodies for owner. I'm sure he was pleased. \n\nAnd then... everything changed when the fire nati- Err. Wrong story. After around lunch, the tone of the entire chain shifted. Apparently, Owner had become furious about... something. It was never actually said, but he apparently called in to his local $SN fuming. Theen it came down to blame. Who setup $OMs account? (the office). Who did $OMs job training? (the office). Who did the office purchase their car from ?!?!? (Idk... Honda, probably?) That wasn't an actual question asked, but that was the gist of this hour of the e-mail chain. Finally, they hit the question. THE question. \"Well, who worked with them yesterday?\". I'm not sure how, but I could feel people from multiple states all somehow triangulate on me and turn to look in my direction. \n\nWhat followed was fun chain of people chiming in that led to this exchange (note: words are reorganized and changed for anonymity but tone and subject are accurate).\n\n&gt;$SN1: Well, I think we have nailed down the source of the problem. Now it's just how we decide to proceed from here. We have enough people that I'm sure who can come to a satisfactory decision. \n\n&gt;$SN2: I agree. We have already started talks with $Owner on what he feels would be acceptable to resolve this situation and another 'poor unfortunate soul' will be calling the office Tuesday to continue. \n\n&gt;$SN3: That is good to hear, but I feel that we haven't discussed the real issue properly. This was a failing on our parts, and especially on the part of $ITOverlord. From talking to $Owner, if this is the kind of support we we feel is acceptable to be offering, then I believe any parties involved should be seriously looked into for re-training on our core company values. $BB, I'm sure you will provide a satisfactory explanation on how you will be handling this. \n\n&gt;$VP: It has become apparent to me that we have people involved in this incident who have failed to properly research into this issue enough to make an informed decision on how this should be handled. I'm going to be stepping in to take over, and ending this email chain. Now. After this e-mail any further complaints or thoughts on this subject WILL go directly to me. I agree with the several sentiments expressed in this chain. This is a great learning opportunity for everyone in this recipients list. I mean, everyone. There are multiple recordings attached to this thread showing one of our employees working with a difficult situation and being professional, efficient, and pleasant throughout. $ITOverlord displayed large amounts of patience, understanding, and flexibility despite being faced with sometimes open hostility. Myself and $BB already discussed how we feel he handled this situation, and other than the fact that he should of extricated himself from it sooner felt that he handled it well. I will be calling the office myself on Tuesday to discuss how this was handled with Owner personally. \n\nI could hear the pins drop from around the world. I adopted the smuggest grin I could muster, walked into my last meeting for the day with $BB and got told, very succinctly and seriously that I was to act humbled and grateful, with 0% of my usual lackadaisical charm if ANYONE talked to me about this. \n\nAs it turned out, VP had apparently started reaming everyone. I was painted as a serious and straitlaced tech (...sorta true) who always excelled in customer service (very true) and was basically used  as a bludgeon against a lot of the $SNs in the chain. $BB and $VP had been the two to actually listen to the recording, and I am probably going to have to answer some questions and have my ticket scrutinized (yay for good notes). \n\n\nSo yeah. Not a 100% clean end, but very satisfying. I also got permission to post this followup (and to keep the OG thread open) so double clear!\n",

        "text": "## The VERY old man (edited for content)\n\nHey there TFTS!!! [u/8l4ck83rry](https://www.reddit.com/u/8l4ck83rry) back again, with another chapter from my IT saga! I’ll try to post one every week \\(until I’m caught up to the present; it’ll be quite a few\\). So, without further ado…\n\n**The VERY old man**\n\n**Setting** A client\\-facing service desk, in the biggest municipal area for 120 miles in any direction. The city itself is constantly flooding, or choked in smog, or Imhotep\\-level dust storms. Its boundaries are defined by the “loop”; a circular road on the edge of it. Everything out past the loop looks like a setting from a Mad Max movie. The general population is typically missing some sort of body part, and people usually have more fingers than teeth. Oil is the life\\-blood of the land. And now, the players!!!\n\n**$Me –** 8l4ck83rry\n\n**$OldMan –** a very old man\n\nIt’s mid\\-shift, and the work flow has been steady. Clients have been updated on the status of their repairs with us, the “worst technician ever” \\(**$SnappleFacts;** more on him in a later story\\) was out that day, and everything seemed to be humming along. Then, something foul came in on the wind…\n\nAn elderly gentleman came trudging towards the help desk. It was commendable, seeing as how each step almost seemed smaller than the last, and rocked his body back and forth almost like a child’s wind\\-up\\-robot toy, with the cane slung on his arm acting as both pendulum and metronome. We make eye contact, and I start to move towards him so that I can assist him with his device, when suddenly it hits me. I can only smell urine. This isn’t pee, the like of which would come out of a child, but the heavily medicated, stagnant, fermented pee of someone who is quickly approaching the top of the reaper’s list. In a display of professionalism, I stop myself from recoiling in disgust and from grimacing \\(I think I strained something in the process\\) and pull out a chair for him to sit on while I work on his device.\n\nAt this point \\(all while breathing only through my mouth\\), we being the check\\-in process, and I start collecting all the usual information \\(client name, whether or not there’s an active SLA, device issue, etc\\).\n\n**$Me** – Good afternoon Sir, what can we do for you?\n\n**$OldMan** \\- \\*speaks unintelligible words\\*\n\n**$Me** – I’m sorry Sir, I couldn’t make that out. Could you say that again.\n\nAt this point, I have to lean in closer, and some part of me in the back of my head is CERTAIN that I’m going to be tasting this smell for the remainder of the day\n\n**$OldMan** – I can’t get online.\n\n**$Me** – Ok, mind if I take a look?\n\n**$OldMan** – Ok…\n\nI take his laptop from him, start it up, see that it doesn’t require a password, and start checking his network connection. All the while, **$OldMan** is staring off into space, either communing with being from another world, or forgetting where he is; it was hard to tell, the pee smell was suffocating and impaired my ability to think.\n\nI noticed that he had a Chrome window open, but none of the tabs had loaded. I checked his wi\\-fi connection, see that the physical switch is off, turn it back on, enter the SSID and password for our guest test wi\\-fi…\n\n**$Me** – Alright Sir, it looks like your wi\\-fi was off, so I turned it back on for you. Since the fix was so simple, there’s no charge today \\(\\*usual charge for a “Quick Fix” was $40\\). I’m going to go ahead reload these tabs so that you can see that everything is working.\n\nI want to start this part by saying I wish we didn’t have to be so thorough. I also want to say that I wish they implemented a content filter on our test wi\\-fi. I reload all 8 tabs in quick succession, moving from one tab to the other before the prior is finished loading. Once all are done, I cycle back to the first tab, and I’m immediately greeted with rule\\-34\\-level\\-nsfw content.\n\nBear in mind, the help desk we’re at is facing the entire store, and there’s nothing obstructing the view of this laptop for a good 30ft.\n\nI quickly close the tab, only to be greeted by another NSFW. On closing that, another NSFW. This continue through all the tabs.\n\nI close out the entire window, and, while trying to maintain professionalism,\n\n**$Me** – Ok Sir, you’re good to go.\n\n**$OldMan** – Ok.\n\nI close his laptop, and stand back, giving him room to stand up, and getting ready to catch him if he should fall over \\(it looked like he might\\). After about 30 – 40 seconds, he’s out of the chair, and without a word, he begins his wobble towards the store enterance.\n\nNow I had been in that smell for a relatively short time. However, due to its pungency, I had gone nose\\-deaf to it relatively quickly. So, I was a little surprised/concerned the smell reared its offending head again. I looked back at where he had been sitting and did my best not to wretch; turns out, he had peed. Again. In the seat. And it spread to the carpet. Much like glitter, this stuff got everywhere! I don’t even remember him touching his pants, and yet, SOMEHOW, it go onto the desk. I put in a call to facilities to have it cleaned up \\(biohazard protocol had to be followed; fun stuff\\). He never came back.\n\nTL;DR – Old man is should probably close his browser before bring computer in for repairs.\n\nP.S. Big shout\\-out to **Selben** for being the inspiration behind finally sharing my stories. If you haven’t read those yet, you’re doing yourself a disservice!\n\nEdit: I'm new to user/reddit naming convention\n\nEdit2: For content \\(sorry mods\\).\n\nEdit 3: Due to an error on my part, this story didn't make it up the first time, or the second time \\(for very different reasons\\).  As such, I'll post another story tomorrow to make up for it :\\)",

        "text": "This happened many years back while working tech support for a very large software company. They had recently started beta testing a hosted service that included email. This company is big on dogfooding, or at least at that time they were. This meant that a number of employees, including the senior VP for hosted services, had been migrated to the new service. Technically employees still had access to their email on the older on-prem servers as a backup but most of them forgot about this.\n\nOne day our manager tells us that there has been an incident at the data center that was hosting the Exchange servers. Apparently workers were replacing batteries in some of the UPSs when a wrench was dropped causing one of said batteries to arc and set off the fire suppression system and shutting down the servers. As a result a bunch of employees call in wanting to know why they can’t access their email and most are understanding and just need a little help accessing their on-prem email. We didn’t get all the details until later, all we know at the time was that the fire suppression system was triggered and the fire department was called.\n\nThen I get a call from the VP about why he couldn’t access his email on his pet project. \n\n&gt; $VP Why can’t access my email?\n\n&gt; $ZM Well sir that’s because the data center is currently on fire.\n\n&gt;$VP What do you mean the data center is on fire?\n\n&gt;$ZM I mean it caught fire and the building was evacuated. News crews are on the scene. \n\n&gt;$VP Why didn’t anyone tell me about this?!  . . . Sorry, I was yelling at people who are supposed to keep me informed about such things, not you. You can close this ticket as I’m sure there is a bridge call that I’m going to crash and they can explain why I wasn’t notified.\n",

Part of the agreement with the install was **$ISP** would either send out one of their own install techs or hire a vendor to come run these two cables. Everything was all scheduled out and this is how it goes. \n\nDay of install comes along and we show up on site waiting for installer to show and run cables. .Just about right on time here comes **$FNG** looking a bit blazed like he just finished up a joint in the parking lot, I digress however. \n\n&gt; **$FNG** Are you **$Me** I'm **$FNG** here to install the cables you have scheduled, where will this be installed at. \n\n&gt; **$Me** Down the hall we have a demarc with all **$ISP** equipment placed in it, from there we will go about 75 - 80' down the hall and place the two cables with jacks on the wall for connection to extend out the demarc. \n\n**$FNG** asks to go check it out where everything is going and this is where it takes a turn... \n\n&gt; **$FNG** So, ummm **$Me** I don't do that bro, I was just sent here to pull cables\n\n&gt; **$Me** No, you are contracted to pull two cables from here, punch them down on your equipment and place two jacks down the hall. PM at **$ISP** scheduled this so they can place their equipment.\n\n&gt; **$FNG** No bro, I'm new and I'll have to call my boss and find out.. But I don't do punch downs, just pull cable. \n\nAt this point I let him go off and make a call meanwhile I'm calling PM at **$ISP** to let them know whats going on and get it corrected. PM states **$FNG** was to pull and terminate cable as I expected. About this time **$FNG** shows back up to tell me boss told him to start and he would straighten it out and get back to us. \n\nAbout a hour later **$FNG** shows up to tell me he's all done. Before I could get a word out of my mouth out the door **$FNG** goes and down the hall I go to demarc. \n\nWhen I go in the demarc room, no cables are present, walk down to the room for the extension, again no cables. I go grab a ladder, pop open the ceiling tiles to find **$FNG** had pulled cables outside the demarc room and extension room, coiled it up and left. \n\nWe ended up finishing off the job and putting the jacks in the wall and punching down to the block in the demarc as **$ISP** techs were scheduled that afternoon for equipment installs. \n\n**TL;DR**: Cable tech pulls the, ain't my job card, does half a job and bails.

She's a high-level director and often tries to circumvent our Help Desk:\n\n&gt;$D: $Tech, you need to help me. There's an event going on in the lab I'm in and there's no network. We can't move classrooms because there are classes in all the other labs. These people came here specifically for this event and are only here for two days.\n\n&gt;$Me: Well that doesn't sound good at all. Have you put in a ticket with our Help Desk?\n\n&gt;$D: Yes, I was on the phone with them for an hour and they didn't help at all.\n\n&gt;$Me: You mean they didn't send a ticket to networking?\n\n&gt;$D: No they didn't.\n\nMy first thoughts are, [that's suspicious](https://www.redbubble.com/people/maddiedx/works/24470997-thats-suspicious-dog). Considering our first level help desk doesn't do advanced troubleshooting with our network. They mainly do password resets and walk users through logging into applications. I started to suspect that she didn't want to wait in the queue because we're \"too slow.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: Well that's odd. They should have logged a priority 1 ticket to our Networking Team for someone to look at, which we'd all be notified of.\n\n&gt;$D (In a snarky tone): Well, they didn't and I can't get ahold of the networking director, $K (who also happens to oversee the team I'm on, Desktop Support).\n\n&gt;$Me: I'm sorry to hear that and I understand that you need the network for your event. If I could see anything on the network I'd look for you but I don't have access to those things.\n\n&gt;$D: Can't you do anything?\n\n&gt;$Me: If I see $K, I'll let him know.\n\n&gt;$D: Okay bye.\n\nI ended up reaching out to a Networking manager and let him know what was going on, he said he'd look into it. Luckily I had washed my hands of it and didn't hear of the incident (or from $D for anything else) after that.",

I dont put everything in my posts. Just because I did not specifically state it, does not mean I did not do it. \n\nI edit my posts down for timing, spacing and cutting out boring events.

We had a rash of users unable to open their desktop $BSS apps, but otherwise, everything has been ridiculously routine.\n\n**QUICK REMINDER**: I work as a phone tech for a small company, recently acquired by a slightly larger company, that contracts with a big software company, to provide support for their big software suite ($BSS).\n\nOn the side, I fix the occasional PC, keep up my own vehicle (which I just spent a month chasing down a pernicious short in the blinkers, only fixed by replacing an entire taillight), and generally keep to myself (when I got my own space, I **reveled** in my newfound solitude).\n\nLots of changes at work have kept me busy: team restructuring, training, new passwords for the software we use to troubleshoot and take tickets, new software for taking tickets... it's all been a bit of a blur.\n\nWhen I finally got something interesting, though, my firstthought was, \"Something worthy of TFTS! It's about time!\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Ticket title: Can't activate $BSS\n\nAccording to their profile, the company was located in Canada. It put a big smile on my face.\n\n(Quick aside: I love dealing with Canadians and people from the UK. They are unfailingly polite, patient, and willing to work as carefully to fix their issue as needed. Everyone else is hit or miss.)\n\nI called the number, and a woman answered the phone.\n\n&gt;Me: Good morning, this is {molotok.getName();}, how may I help you this morning?\n\n&gt;$Bubbly Canadian Admin ($BCA... this works twice, as she mentioned she was originally from Vancouver): Oh, hi! Thank you for calling so quickly! I've been doing okay for a while, and then today, I got this error!\n\nWe set up a screen-share, and sure enough... \"This is an unlicensed product, yadda yadda...\"\n\nWe navigated into the account details, and again, there was a big red box saying \"license expired.\"\n\nHowever, when I checked on the account, the subscription was up to date, in good standing, paid up... nothing should have been wrong.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, go to this link (*I sent a link to an activation troubleshooter in the chat that came with the screen share*) and run that. It should tell us where the issue is.\n\n&gt;$BCA: Okay! Cool! I'll do that!\n\nAfter a quick download, and going through the entire process...\n\n&gt;Troubleshooter: Product is already activated.\n\n...wait... what?!?\n\n&gt;$BCA: Wow... that's not right, is it?!\n\n&gt;Me: No... no, it's clearly not.\n\nOn that same page she had opened from the link was another, more in-depth troubleshooter. I had her run that...\n\n&gt;Big Troubleshooter: Product already activated.\n\nNo... no it's... wait...\n\n&gt;Me: Go back to that app we looked at before... I want to look at something...\n\n&gt;$BCA: Okay! Let's do that!\n\nWe navigated to the account details. Right above the big red error box, there was a small link: \"Click here for additional license details.\"\n\n&gt;Me: Please click on that...\n\n&gt;$BCA: Sure!\n\nIn that link, we saw another license.\n\nIt was activated, all right. And not activated at the same time.\n\n&gt;Me: That's... new.\n\n&gt;$BCA: Oh... I think I had a home account on here before, and I must have activated this as the business account when the home one ran out!\n\n&gt;Me: Maybe. I will admit, I have never seen this before.\n\n(Side note: I probably will see it again. I really dislike the way $BSS handles their licensing activation. It's rife with bugs. Not a week goes by where I don't have some crazy license issue with someone's $BSS installation.)\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, I have one more thng we might try. Unfortunately, if it doesn't work, we'll have to uninstall and reinstall the entire suite.\n\n&gt;$BCA: Okay! Let's try it! I'm okay with doing a full install, though!\n\nWe went into the credentials of her PC, removed everything associated with $BSS, and tried to fire up $BSS.\n\n(Last side note: I also dislike how \"helpful\" PCs are when it comes to storing credentials. there are two places that, if you have credentials stored or connected to $BSS, it will break licensing... which is rife with bugs already.)\n\nPredictably, it didn't work.\n\nSo... we uninstalled $BSS, rebooted the PC, and began the reinstall process.\n\nDuring the installation, we chatted away amiably, mostly small talk. It's good to not talk about tech stuff at times.\n\nWe got everything installed, activated the software, made sure the licensing was squared away, and made sure everything worked properly.\n\n&gt;$BCA: Oh, that's awesome! Thank you so much! Where can I give you your 5 stars!?\n\nShe thanked me for **my** patience. This is why I like Canadian admins.\n\nTL;DR: If you put a software license in a box, and leave it there for a while, it will be both activated and expired at the same time, until someone looks at it... or, sometimes, **after** someone looks at it.",

Right now, I work mostly as Desktop Support with some Network Administration and Infrastructure thrown in for good measure. We've recently \\(last couple of years\\) outsourced our Help Desk \\(HD\\) to a third party vendor in the Middle East.\n\nOur customer is an engineer who has been with the company since mainframes were a hot commodity. I get the ticket from the HD stating that the user needed to add a plotter in his area. The ticket history showed that the HD asked for permission to remote into his machine, they received permission, remoted into his machine, and proceeded to NOT find the plotter in the list of available plotters. So, they kicked it over to us.\n\nI emailed the customer to find out what happened when he navigated to the printer/plotter list \\(ours is a standard file share setup for printers i.e. \\\\\\\\companyname\\\\printers\\). He proceeds to navigate to \\\\\\\\companyname\\\\printers and finds the plotter without issue. After double\\-clicking the icon and sending a test message, the customer is happy.\n\nI check the ticket to find the HD agent who couldn't find the plotter and try to contact him. Instead, I get his supervisor who proceeds to tell me that this agent has been fired for basically being as unhelpful as humanly possible.\n\nThe supervisor looks at the ticket and asks if I was able to resolve the ticket. I tell them what happened and he says, \"If the plotter is plotting, why are you calling me?\" then hangs up the phone. \n\nOrdinarily, this wouldn't bother me since I have a thousand other things to do but this one just rubbed me wrong.\n\nI contacted my supervisor who told me he'd look into it. \n\nAfter two days, he calls me to tell me that the supervisor in question has also been fired. \n\nI ask if they were fired because of me and he says \"No, I think this was the last straw for a lot of people in HD.

        "text": "This, my fellow IT heroes, is why it NEVER pays to be cheap in IT. Also, why family/business ought to be separate.\n\n\nAs I've mentioned before, I am the IT manager at a medical facility, so I wear a lot of hats every day: SysAdmin (most of the time), basic computer skills teacher, Network Admin, VMWare admin etc...\n\n\nMy environment consists of several physical servers and a VMware virtual environment that we are migrating to. We also host multiple EHR systems on-site, seeing as this is a multi-specialty practice and neither the dental department's boss, nor our eye department's boss liked the main $crappyEHR used by the medical department's doctors. This happened before I was involved, and ownership decided to purchase seperate, specialized EHRs for those departments, which makes sense, because as specialized ones, they were better suited to the job then $crappyEHR. The databases for those specialized EHRs, $crappyEHR, and our practice management system that ties all of them together through interfaces were all then stuffed onto a single, physical database server. No redundancy, because at the time, Money. 1 point of failure. Sweet. Fucking. Jesus. \n\n\nAfter I got involved, one of my first missions was to rectify this situation, firstly because if anything happened to that Db server, the place was screwed, and secondly because the guy that built the server in the first place built it with a RAID that only had 250ish gbs of space, which by this point had MAYBE 10 gb of space left on it. The situation was pretty critical, and was compounded by the sloppily written queries being used by $crappyEHR, which to their credit they are currently working on optimizing.\n\n\nNow to introduce the characters:\n\n$me: your's truly\n\n$dad: my father, a software developer with 30+ years of experience. He's an absolutely brilliant developer. I've literally yet to meet one that comes even close, and his SQL queries are ALWAYS optimized. He's known ownership for 20 of those years, and who they trust more than they do me with computers...despite me having proven, time and again that in matters that don't include development, I'm more competent. I took the job as a favor to him (and the fact that they gave me a competitive salary, plus I like the guys too, when they actually trust me.)\n\nI was looking to at least begin solving this problem, and having it cost as little as possible. Based on what I was seeing with the Db server, I figured moving it to virtual would be a problem, and virtualization would be impossible without completely re-configuring the SAN we were using for the virtual environment. There would be severe i/o bottlenecks. Unfortunately, I turned into Cassandra when this was discussed with $dad and ownership, and my instructions were \"virtualize the server, add some HDD space. It should work fine.\" Because, hey: we have a mostly empty host, and we have space on the SAN, and it'll be free. Meanwhile, 3 more SAS disks to build a RAID at least 3 times the size of what we have now will cost $1000 (physical server had 3 empty HDD bays).\n\n\nSo I did, against my better judgement. Spent a Sunday remotely converting the server to a VM, and sticking it my mostly empty 3rd host. Knowing the potential for issues to arise, I kept the old physical server intact, just disconnected. I think most of you can already guess what happened, but I'll tell you anyway: PAGEIOLATCH wait types, and the \"I/O taking more than 15 seconds error\" in the SQL server log. Most of these are caused by the slow-working queries of $crappyEHR, which now have to contend not only with how they are written but with i/o bottlenecks. \n\n\nHere's the problem though: I can't just roll everything back. Things have to be working. We can't experience downtime. It takes me time to convince $dad and ownership that nothing can be done about the queries right now and finally purchase those 3 HDDs. I plug them in, build a second RAID on the physical server, and restore the databases from backups I made on the virtual server, all this time being told by my $dad that this will not rectify the situation. It did. Not quite...since there are still latch waits, but $crappyEHR thinks that's their fault. But all the time that server was a virtual instance, the staff was experiencing periodic freezes, with waiting tasks on the Db server skyrocketing into the hundreds (that I noticed). That is no longer the case, and the other databases work without a hitch. The virtual server will serve a role as pseudo-redundancy in case this one goes up, until I can get something into the budget to rectify that problem. \n\n\ntl;dr: young IT guy goes against better judgement, forces the issue he knew would happen to happen, and then resolves the issue the way he wanted to in the first place.

        "text": "Hey all, back again with a fun one. This happened yesterday, and its slow this morning so may as well throw this up. \n\nAs usual, quick background, I work for a company that handles IT for most offices in a single industry. There is sometimes data sensitive enough for there to be legal enforcement of it, so we are veeery careful on how we do our network and server setups. We have standardized equipment, IP schemes, naming processes etc. Very very meticulous and enforced for good reason. We have multiple levels of techs with varying skills (ranging from basic entry level IT work, to handling 20+ offices for a single company and having personal knowledge of terminal servers and etc. for those specific offices). My role mostly involves managing our internal portal, creating programs and utilities for employees/management, and being tagged in when something is juuust below 'Level 3' clearance to make sure it really needs to hit that high. With all that in place lets begin!\n\n\n\nSo the day starts as usual, roll into the office, stare longingly at the coffee bar, wondering once again why I quit that sweet sweet caffeine, before sighing and taking my place at my desk. Things are going well, we are nearing a holiday weekend so it's pretty slow which leaves our high level techs available to help out the lower levels as problems arise, which gives me time to knock out some bug fixes, and continue slamming my head against a wall of SQL development issues I've been working on for a while. \n\nWhich is why it was surprising that, as I tried to glare a PostgreSQL database out of existence, someone started to knock on my desk. I decided not to risk my latent existence wiping powers spontaneously manifesting on this poor level 1 tech, and putting on my best co-worker smile ask what I can help with. I'll spare the long drawn out explanation, but the gist is that a high profile office had requested me specifically to help with a problem. They had recently hired a new office manager, and she was having all sorts of problems. I pull up the account info, notice that I had worked with them on a huge escalation case before, hence the specific request, and then check my e-mail. Which I regret immediately. \n\nSee, my initial plan to tag in a level 3 or 4 tech (which is the normal procedure with these kinds of offices and situations) is immediately shattered, as I notice an email chain, 13 messages deep, with the recipients having all kinds of fun acronyms, starting at the local management letters and ending at... Branch VP. And of course, the last email in the chain is \"ITOverlord, with as much as you wowed this office last time you worked with them, we expect this time to be no different!\"... from the VP. \n\nI start cursing... basically every entity I can, and ready myself to work with the office. Setting the stage now $Me, will be yours truly, $OM will be the beast from ancient times, the new office manager, and $CO will be the pleasant, but entirely clueless owner of the office. \n\n\nI put on my best customer service pants (the ones with the elastic removed from the waistband), and give the office a call. \n\n&gt;$Me: Hey $CO! Just reaching out to see if we can fix the issues $OM is having for you! What's going on?\n\n&gt;$CO: Oh! $Me, thank god! We just hired $OM, her training period ended and she has no access to anything! She says she is having trouble logging in, viewing reports, heck she hasn't even been able to clock in! We want this fixed as soon as possible, because we hired her as a ringer to deal with some of the issues we've been having. We need to leverage her experience as soon as possible, so please get this fixed quick!\n\n&gt;$Me: No worries $CO! I completely understand, give me her info and I'll get to the bottom of this fore you!\n\nSo I go to it, I get her info, pop into the DC... and find no issues. Her account is setup with all the privileges and part of all the groups it should be. I remote into an unused workstation, use the creds and boom. No problems. I check their Office software. She's setup as a manager, can pull reports, has printer access, can use the B2B vpn tunnels to the other locations fine... Weird. I jump into HER workstation, maybe its new and things are missing, or its local policies inexplicable went crazy? Nope. Everything works how it should, all functionality as normal. Through this entire process I've been trying to reach $OM, but she wasn't at her desk (couldn't reach her by extension), and apparently wasn't even on her floor according to the random employee I rang to tap her on the shoulder for me. Finally, I give $CO a call, get $OMs cell number after he fails to page her, and ring her up. \n\n&gt;$Me: Hi $OM! This is $ITOverlord, from $Company, I'm working on your tick-\n\n&gt;$OM: FINALLY, god I have too much to do to be dealing with this crap. Did you get the problems fixed?\n\n&gt;$Me: Well, I looked into it and couldn't find any issues with your accounts or your comp-\n\n&gt;$OM: Liar!\n\nNow... I'm a very reasonable, chill individual. But this took me by surprise. I felt a vein a thought didn't exist anymore pop up on my forehead, both by the tone, and the fact that her voice sounded like sandy winds from a lost time blowing and rasping through catacombs long since forgotten. You know in 'The Mummy' when it firsts resurrects and is speaking while spitting out sand? Like that, but angry and spiteful. \n\n&gt;$Me: I'm... sorry?\n\n&gt;$OM: Liar. You didn't talk to me about my problems at all. You couldn't have looked into anything! \n\n&gt;$Me: Well... I spoke with $CO, and had him explain what was going on... then looked into the issues he told me about. I tried to reach you but you weren't at your desk or on your floor...\n\n&gt;$OM: Of course not! What's the point of sitting there if nothings working, I've been in the break room!\n\nNow... I've been working on all this for over an hour at this point. So she has been sitting in the break room... doing nothing, and ignoring the owners pages... for over an hour. \n\n&gt;$Me: ...Alright, well lets go ahead and get you back there so you can show me what's going on. \n\n&gt;$OM: *grumbles some ancient curse and makes her way there* Alright, I'm here. Fix it.\n\n&gt;$Me: Of course, let's just get you to log-\n\n&gt;$OM: I can't login it doesn't work. Watch. \n\nI proceed to spend about five minutes watching her type in everything BUT her username as she tries to get access before taking over and getting her logged in myself. This led to a good 20 minutes argument about what her username was, which I will omit for time and sanity... \n\n&gt;$Me: Alright, no go ahead and show me what's happening when you try to do anything...\n\n&gt;$OM: I can't nothing looks right and nothing works...\n\nNow... I remember this conversation vividly. For one, it was yesterday, and for two, it is the single most frustrating conversation I've ever had. In my life. And I have five younger siblings. Just thinking about it this morning is making me angry, but reliving it is a bit too much. The gist of it, is that at her old place of employ, they used an older office suite (2003 I came to learn), didn't use $OfficeSoftware, or any industry standard. They didn't have a domain. They used personal email addresses. As it turns out, the office did just about everything manually. As in, on paper. Which is how she expected things to happen here. From how she described things, I also suspect the two (yes two) pcs in her old place of employ to have been windows XP as well...\n\nI spent a solid hour in a constant state of being griped at before I was finally able to wrap it up, ending with this fun exchange...\n\n&gt;$Me, struggling to keep from quite literally exploding: Well, unfortunately $YourCompany has been setup like this for a while so you will need to learn how these systems work. If you need we can setup a training tim-\n\n&gt;$OM: No! Now you listen here. I've been doing this job longer than you've been alive. 58 years. I know what I'm doing, and how things SHOULD be done. You go talk to $CO and get this fixed!\n\nI was then promptly, and thankfully, hung up on. I took a few minutes. Did a lap, stared longingly at coffee, considered a liquor run, contemplated life some, before I finally called $CO. He was expecting me. \n\n&gt;$CO: Heeey $IT, just got done talking to $OM and I'm a little disappointed... You've spent a lot of time on this, and from what she tells me nothings been fixed. She said you were being quite rude even. What's going on? Do we need to talk to (Mid level manager)?\n\n&gt;$Me: Hey $CO, I think we do actually. We should also pull in (Upper regional manager) as well. \n\n&gt;$CO, sounding very displeased that I didn't cow: ...Oh? Well what's going on. \n&gt;$Me: **Proceeds to explain in detail the call, from start to finish** Obviously, I don't expect you to just believe me, so I'll send you our calls recordings, of course. \n\n&gt;$CO: That sounds quite a bit different than what I heard. I'm sure a lot of it is just misunderstandings on her part, so you really should just be patient with her. She's pushing 100 you know. \n\n&gt;$Me: Oh? I wouldn't have guessed. Like discussed, I'll send the recordings and email (relevant managers) for you. Expect those to come in the next hour or so. \n\nSo I did. I pulled recordings, typed up the e-mail, sent it and then walked to the highest power I had access to in my office. I sat in a nice comfy chair as he looked at my confusedly, watching as he got, then read my e-mail, and had a niiice long conversation. Apparently, several others had read it as well as by the time I got back to my desk there was a chain exploding. \n\nSo here I sit, chuckling and rolling my eyes at a few vaguely insulting/threatening e-mails, knowing full well that only two people listened to the recording. Luckily one of those is the Branch VP, who already assured me (via e-mail no less) that I handled things as good as anyone could be expected to and not to worry. I'm not sure if he is in today due to holiday weekend, but either way I get a bit of amusement while once again trying to glare PGSql out of existence.",

        "text": "Sometimes I wonder how can we expect more from the users when the IT managers are ... let's just say how they are.\n\nSo, I work as a trainer for a L1 support team, part of my job is also to assist our team's managers as well as the L2 (Local IT). A few months ago one of the IT managers from one of our locations decided he wanted to make a change that will help improve the process. Most of the time they need to inform us about their brilliant ideas and I was also put in CC in the email.\n\nWhat he wanted?\nTo grant access to all his users to create a certain type of tickets that only the IT users can create. Even tho it was only one type of tickets the platform does not allow you to give permissions to only one type, it's all or nothing.  \n\nI ask the manager if I should reply and explain the nice way why his idea was stupid and he said yes. \nSo I start writing an email where I explain that this specific access cannot be provided on it's own and what he's basically asking for is to make all his users IT users. (I'm not even going to go into the reporting issues that I have explained to him) but I did explain that his users cannot create normal tickets that will reach the L1 team properly, this access will give them permissions to send the tickets directly to the Local IT and even Central IT. \n\nI strongly advised him not to go thru with it. \nShortly after that I was removed from the cc in the upcoming emails and heard that he has included a higher up manager. I though the manager will explain maybe in a better way.\n\nA few months have passed and I did not even though about it until all hell broke loose. I heard that the change was logged in the system and also approved by the regional manager. A few weeks later all those clueless poor souls of users had access to create IT users tickets, will you blame them for sending stupid password reset tickets to a central IT that does not even deal with that specific application. \n\nNow this is where the even more stupid part comes in. The IT manager contacts us because tickets reach central teams directly and he does not know what's happening. \nI explain to him once again that part of the access that he had requested also includes this specific access for them. I suggest one more time to revert to the normal process and this will be solved. \n\nYou will expect him at this point to realize his mistake and let us fix it. Nop, he still wants his users to have that specific access so only after another 2 weeks and probably escalations from all teams, confused users that did not knew what was happening and other issues that I have already predicted in my email he ask us to change them back and only keep 10 of them with this access. \n\nTL;DR: IT manager wants to make all his business users IT users, ignores my email where I explain the consequences of this action and gets what he wants only to realize that it's a disaster and needs to go to the old process.

        "text": "Two stories for you all today. Both involving stupid users.\n\nFor those of you who don't know. I am an application admin in the health care sector. Since februari last year I've started working for a relatively small company (~700 employees) and as a result I have to wear a lot of different hats. Which is fun, and sometimes leads to these situations.  \nWe've outsourced our workplace automation and support for most of the basic stuff to a third party which comes with it's own helpdesk. This third party is relatively new to us, and as a result there's the occasional bits of friction. It used to be so that if you called IT someone would likely come over either the same day or the next to help fix your problem. Pretty much no matter what the problem was. From lost passwords, to unplugged devices and if it fell outside the guy's scope he'd get in contact with the right people for the user in order to sort things out.\n\nThings have changed for the worse for most users as the new party won't do on-site support and generally handles everything through a much larger helpdesk. This frustrates some of our users who would take instructions like 'Move your mouse upwards' as literally as possible.\n\nOver the last two days I've been having a conversation with a user via a kind of e-mail systen that's built in to our client information system. She had called me before that she had trouble with her e-mail account. Since that's outside my scope I told her to call the helpdesk instead.\n\n&gt;User: \"Half an hour just now! at the phone with PUSH (name redacted obviouslY) But they can't figure it out! I have to get to appointment.  \nI want a phone call with you for help!\"\n\nIt's translated from dutch, but that's the basic grammar she used.  \nI didn't really want to call her, after all it's our new IT partner's job to provide support. But I can't just leave her hanging either.\n\n&gt;Me: Hello User, what's the precise nature of your problem?\n\n&gt;User: I can't log in to work. When I go to the intranet site and try to log in with my &gt;mail adress and the password from PUSH.\n&gt;But it's not right.  \n&gt;I can't log in at home.....I don't know where I have to be and where I have to enter my username and the password from PUSH.\n&gt;I can't get in to the team e-mail.  \n&gt;I already have a google account.....?  \n&gt;And what do I have to do with that....Where do I have to go...?  \n&gt;I don't understand it at all.\n\n&gt;Me: Hello User,\n\n&gt;Intranet, your e-mail and the team e-mail are all provided for us by Google.  \n&gt;So if you log in with your e-mail you can access all of those things. To confirm I've got your e-mail as &lt;user@carefacility.org&gt; is that correct?\n\n&gt;User: Yes that's correct.\n\n&gt;Me: Yesterday you spoke on the phone with PUSH, they gave you a password. Can you go to www.gmail.com and see if you can log in with that mail adress and password?\n\n&gt;User: If I go there I get my own gmail. It didn't ask me for a password.\n\nOkay so now I'm apparently supporting privately owned devices... Too late to back out now.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, you can log in to multiple google accounts on a computer. Can you follow these instructions:  https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1721977\n\nNow giving credit, where credit is due. The user managed to follow these instructions. So points for her.\n\n&gt;User: I managed to do it, in part. It keeps saying that the password is incorrect and I should contact the domain admin.  \n&gt;I got this password from PUSH on the 14th of may: &lt;password&gt;  \n&gt;I didn't get a password yesterday.\n\n&gt;Me: Okay, well in that case PUSH will have to provide you with a new password. I'm not allowed to change those. (Really I'm a full google superadmin but I'm not allowed to make these changes much less interesting story which you can ask me about)\n\n&gt;User: OK... Can you instruct PUSH...?\n\n&gt;Me: I'm afraid not I've got a full day today and I won't have the time. Quickest way is if you call them.\n\n&gt;User: I'm not going to call them again. It was hopeless yesterday. Not my job...\n\nAt this point I stopped replying. Because the only reply I can give at this point while keeping my sanity is that it's not my job either to call the helpdesk on her behalf.\n\n**I got confused so I deleted them!**\n\nI got a phone call from a user who needed login credentials for our HR self service portal.  \nI recognized her name. Because I had provided account details for her maybe 2 or 3 days ago. And my coworkers (and PUSH) would have provided her other accounts in roughly the same timespan.\n\nSo naturally I asked her to check her own private e-mail to see if she'd already gotten her login credentials.\n\n&gt;User: Yeah I got e-mails with login data. But I didn't get everything at the same time, and it confused me. So I deleted those e-mails.\n\nAnd this, I tell people, is why I drink.",

        "text": "Long time lurker...I think fourth or fifth time poster? Lost count. Anywho, here's a \"quick\" tale (that ended up longer than I thought it would, sorry ._.) that I find myself recalling to colleagues too often, and just realized I never shared it in here.\n\nI was the sole Tier 2 IT guy in the state for an international company that had headquarters at least a timezone away, but had network management outsourced half a day away. I covered three sites, and served as the eyes, ears, and fingers of the various teams that oversaw the data centers and networks.  \n\nDuring the early spring, I got an email from the datacenter team saying they have a fan error on one of their power supplies. I forgot what piece of equipment it was, but it was clearly being monitored from afar and worth my attention.  \n\nOne quick walk through a testing lab and two different levels of raised floor later, and I entered what I often referred to as my sanctuary. A well-cooled data center, filled with that white-noise that I'm sure many of y'all have grown to enjoy. It even had empty spaces in the racks where one could lay a piece of plywood across 4 racks and fit an IT guy needing a nap. This was a fact I never got to fully utilize, but it was often a nice daydream.  \n\nIt didn't take long for me to find the fan. It's one of two larger power supplies in some rather large network appliance that, again, I've forgotten the exact function of as I type this. One of the fans was running, and the one next to it had stopped...and had some gray and brown debris next to it. Upon closer inspection, I recoiled, but then began laughing my ass off while rummaging for my phone to snap a picture.  \n\nA miller moth had somehow managed to get inside what is supposed to be a mostly sealed room with the exception of the door and air conditioning. As it flew around the room, no doubt trying to chase all the various blinkenlights around the room, it had managed to fly into this power supply fan. Suffice to say I was easily able to make a comparison to a bird hitting a jet engine, except the little bits of wings and a couple legs made the event seem more like a wood-chipper accident. In any case, this moth was apparently big enough to actually cause a failure inside the power supply and kill the fan motor.  \n\nWith my findings, photo, and a slew of Monty Python jokes prepped for the email (\"It is an ex-moth, it has ceased to be, it has shuffled off this mortal coil...and right into some coils inside the PSU\" etc), I headed back to my desk and replied to the datacenter team's email. Shortly after sending the reply, my Lync popped up with a \"LOL\" IM from the datacenter guy who had emailed me. He had appreciated my detailed description, complete with Monthy Python reference. We then began discussing replacing this PSU, including a maintenance window. As most organizations go, the maintenance window had to be after hours. I CC'd my manager on the email so he could approve the overtime, and I spent the next week waiting for the part to come in.  \n   \n  \n\nIn a surprising twist, logistics managed to get the part to arrive half a week early. Despite this miracle, we still stuck with the planned window. The evening of the replacement, I took the time to walk around the office and just take in how eerie it was for no one to be there except for me. Various ideas in the \"big list of things to do in the office when no one else is around\" passed through my mind. Unfortunately (or fortunately), none of those ideas were capitalized on due to my being tired and just wanting to get started on my 45 minute commute home as soon as possible. I walked the part from my \"staging area\" (an empty spot on my desk) to the data center and started making ready to swap out the PSU.  \n\nIt's so nice living in an age of standardized parts and hot-swapping. The whole ordeal itself didn't even need any tools. Just unscrew the screws keeping the PSU in by hand, unplug it from the UPS connection beneath the floor, pull out the PSU, and reverse the process with the new one. Seems easy enough, right? No problem.  \n\nFirst step was to get under the floor. It was a raised one so I had to dig out and dust off the hook we left hanging on one of the racks. I pulled up the tiles, and suddenly had to reassess my entire outlook on life at this organization...  \n\nBeneath the pristine cable organization and crisp, cleanliness of this dataceter was a veritable hellscape of wires and plugs. It was as if all the repressed frustration of the team that put this place together was quite literally buried under the finished and polished product. It was like some kind of cable management graveyard after what was clearly a sysadmin version of The Purge. Yes, plugs were labelled, but half the labels were worn out from other wires sitting and rubbing on them.  \n\nWith hook and flashlight in hand, I started pulling up more tiles until I had pulled open a fissure from where the PSU cord went into the floor and where the UPS plugs were coming in. Seeing a larger portion of \"The Place where Cable Management Goes to Die\" didn't make it much easier. Much like the present-day gawkers looking at the fissures in Hawaii spewing lava, all I could do was take photos with my work phone to send back to the datacenter team. I knew full well that my manager wasn't going to let them dump an entire cable reorganization project on me. Besides, I always wanted to meet some of these datacenter guys. They seemed nice, and it kinda sucks being the only IT guy in the state.  \n\nAfter taking another look at the mess, I finally got down to business and started tracing the PSU cable. Mind you, this wasn't your typical power cord. This thing had some *girth* to it. Unfortunately, so did everything else under that floor, including the cables from the UPS to their respective plugs. Between the lack of light and the tangled mess, I was having moments of cable racism, because all these cables looked *exactly the same*.  \n\nI traced the cord, tied a piece of painter's tape around it where it plugged into one of the UPS connections, and then went back to the PSU to trace it again. I'm a human being. I've made mistakes. Making flaming mistakes is a familial trait on my mom's side (she managed to kill an entire magazine distributor's print queue in the early 90s with one malformed print command), and I was no exception. I traced this cable again, pulling on it to see what moved beyond the knot it was passing through. Once again, I made my way to the painter's tape.  \n\nI was victorious! I had managed to wander through this valley in the shadow of cable spaghetti, and get the same result. Now it was time to pull this cord from the stone and be crowned King of the Britons.  \n\nAnyone that's had to do anything in a datacenter related to power probably knows full well how tough this twist-lock plugs can be. Given how long these cables had been plugged in, and how much anger I could feel radiating from this pit of wires, extracting this plug was no small task. After twisting it for some time, I got it to turn to the pull-out position. With a solid \"guy using muscle for manly things\" grunt, I pulled the cord from the plug....  \n\n...and then there was silence.  \n\nNo. This wasn't just me taking a breather. This was **silence**.  \n\nThe typical hum of fans in the datacenter had ceased. I hadn't been in an area this quiet since wandering around the empty offices. It was unnerving, and I could only hear one thing:  \n\n&gt; \"Put it back..Put It Back...Put-It-Back-***PUT IT BACK!!***\"\n\nTo this day, I cannot recall if that voice was in my head, or coming out of my mouth. All I knew was panic followed by a multitude of attempts to cram that plug back into the receptacle from whence it came.  \n\nThankfully, having been extracted already, this plug was able to be plugged back in with minimal effort. I even did another grunt when I twisted it back to the locked position.\n\nA familiar hum started to return to the room. Lights began coming back on. What was dark turned red, then orange, and eventually green. Life returned to the Cisco IP Phone on the desk. I sat there, wiping a bit of cold sweat from my brow, as I did a very casual inventory of all the systems from a distance, looking for any lights that hadn't come back on automatically.  \n\nIt took a couple of minutes for me to recollect myself, and then pick myself up to go manually power on a couple of the older servers. As I went over to them, I saw that the big \"smart\" PDU we had in the back of the rack was complaining about a recent power loss. I got the older servers started up, and went back to the PDU. I then checked the cord coming from it and running towards the floor...and had a headslap moment.  \n\nThe PDU cord crossed over with the PSU cord behind the rack in a way that I had missed. While I was successful in tracing the cord from the floor to the UPS plug in Cable Management Hell, I had been tracing the wrong cord. Again, cord racism, they all looked exactly the same. I had unplugged the PDU that was powering most of the network core, and all of the servers that hadn't been retired and shut down. The accidental moment of silence resulted.\n\nA few minutes later, I was able to successfully trace the cord from the PSU all the way down the rack and to where it plugged into the UPS plug underneath. Another piece of masking tape with an actual label went onto the plug, and then I went to tracing again from the plug back up to the PSU.  \n\nI traced it back up the rack, back to the dead PSU with moth pieces. Following that, I traced it back down the rack, into the floor, through the electrical spaghetti monster, and back to the labelled plug. A twist and a pull later...and nothing happened.\n\nThis was a case of nothing happening being the best thing that could happen. I pulled the cord through the twists and turns, my mind treating it like a victory parade. Got it past the floor, and pulled the busted PSU out, cord and all! I put the new PSU in, ran the cord on top of the slithering snake pit, left a painter's tape label on the plug, and plugged it in. I wrote down the PDU label on the plug I had accidentally pulled so as to avoid that mistake in the future.  \n\nWith both power supplies running, I closed the fissure I'd pulled open into the floor, and then went over to the Cisco phone to call our after-hours network team on the other side of the world:  \n\n&gt; \"So...you're probably wondering why $location fell off the face of the Earth for about 10 minutes. Funny story...\"\n\n**TL;DR:** Moth sacrifice forces open portal to the depths of Datacenter Hell and brings darkness upon the land",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, Bowling Alley Guy is back, and I probably should have included a trigger warning in the post title given this sub's relationship with printers. Oh well, too late now, I guess we'll just roll with it. I hope this story is appropriate, given that we were playing both the tech support and (l)users roles for this one.\n\n* * * \n\nThe scene was *not* another ordinary day at $Rundownlocation, in fact we were just finishing up a massive project that saw us replacing nearly a quarter million dollars worth of equipment (that I can't be too specific about). During the course of the project, yours truly worked 11 hour shifts daily for nearly two weeks assisting the install crew in any way I could and staying after they left to troubleshoot the inevitable issues they would leave behind. It was exhausting, and everyone was dragging heavily by the end.\n\nThis particular day was the final day the crew was in town, and they were helping us out with any and every issue they could find on our pinsetting machines in an effort to help out as much as possible with the time they were allowed. I spent most of my time helping them replace parts and lubricate nearly every contact point in all 40 machines. My \"C\" mechanic meanwhile was working on facility stuff that had been postponed during the project. By the end of our shift, we were tired, dirty, sore, and ready for our first day off work in nearly a fortnight.\n\nSince I was familiar with the new equipment, I decided to use the last of our time to train $C on some of the useful new features it had. This involved printing some reports from the new front desk computers and taking them to the back where I had set up a spreadsheet to log all the information on the shop computer. Then that would be printed out and filed. Pretty simple stuff. So simple a mechanic can do it.\n\nOr so we thought. The first time we tried to print we got an error and a bunch of weird unholy sounds from the printer. It seemed like the paper would advance a couple inches and stop, followed by the printer having a fit. Rearranging the paper in the tray did nothing to solve the issue. Now, we're just mechanics mostly. We don't really have any experience working with office equipment, and especially not printers. But I've been reading TFTS for quite awhile, and I know the reputation they have here, so I was fully prepared to offer a blood sacrifice if that's what it took to print my spreadsheet.\n\nAfter many more minutes of discussion than was probably necessary, the two of us mechanics came to the conclusion that we had a paper jam of some sort to deal with. This I thought I could handle. I've read stories about these. Just open the access panel and remove the offending paper. Well, because of reasons best described as \"cheap\", when I had asked my boss for a printer for the back, rather than get a simple office toner printer like every single other printer in the building, he had bought us a consumer grade photo printer. And they don't have access panels to clear paper jams. In fact, we were lucky to even have a panel to access the ink cartridges.\n\nMany more minutes than I wish to admit to later, two highly knowledgeable mechanics came to the conclusion that not only did we not have a paper jam access panel, but we didn't seem to have any paper that was jammed anyway. *Something* was blocking the paper from getting through, but whatever it might be was so small and deep inside the printer we couldn't see it. At least until I got out my flashlight and caught a hint of \"neon blast yellow\" behind one of the paper guides.\n\nYou see, before the big project we had left a handful of bright yellow foam earplugs on top the printer, and used them as necessary throughout. But apparently, one had found its way deep inside our printer, a printer that was not designed to even be repairable. Normally, this is where users will break down and call tech support, but dammit, *we are tech support!* We can totally solve this ourselves, right?\n\nI came up with a cunning plan. Using a flat blade screwdriver, I ~~jammed~~ gently wedged it under the plastic paper guide in an attempt to lift it out of the way. This turned out to be a very bad idea, since the guide was both held down with springs, and so thin that it risked being broken apart by the screwdriver. Clearly what this situation needed was more screwdrivers, so I asked $C to bring me all the flat bladed ones we had. He returned with a half dozen.\n\nAs carefully as a mechanic can, I slid them in one at a time alongside each other to support the paper guide without breaking it, and still left enough of a gap that I could reach in with a tool to retrieve the ear plug. During this process, our third mechanic arrived to begin the evening shift. $B was highly amused at the super high tech approach we were taking to printer repairs, especially given that he's about twice my age and could barely tell the difference between a printer and a cell phone.\n\nSo now with *3* mechanics surrounding the wounded printer, we were tasked with how to actually remove the stuck ear plug from a gap the width of a screwdriver blade. After careful consideration and much debate, we all concluded that it was easiest to simply push it back through into the paper tray with one of the screwdrivers.\n\nForeign body now removed, the printer happily printed out the spreadsheet like nothing was ever wrong. Or maybe it was because of the sneaky cut it left on the back of my hand that I didn't notice until I showered at home later. Blood sacrifice indeed.\n\n**TL;DR:** Three. It takes three mechanics to fix a printer.",

That also made me the go-to guy whenever HR wanted some new process 'digitalized'. 'Digitalize' is the favorite word of our HR Director ($HRD). \n\nOn a fateful evening, I was in a meeting with him and one of the HR clerks ($Clerk). The meeting had already been going on for about half an hour when $Clerk introduced the next point on her list.\n\n&gt;**$Clerk:** So right now our employees can use self-service to file an application for vacation. We would like them to be able to do the same with special vacations.\n\n&gt;**$me:** What kinds of vacation would that be?\n\n&gt;**$HRD:** Marriage, childbirth, death of a close relative, death of a distant relative,...\n\nThe list went on. We went into specifics of what the user would be able to legally input (the country I work in has lots of regulation for that). In my head I planned for quotas, message boxes and even for an automated work list, that the clerks could use to keep track of whether documents like birth certificates had already arrived.\n\n&gt;**$HRD:** Then there's [extra special kind of vacation]. We need a quota for that. In hours and not in days. Employees need to be able to apply for any number of hours at once. The quota needs to be as large as the amount of hours the employee works in a week and there are more factors when they're entitled to anything beyond one week.\n\nAt this point I'm having trouble to keep up with all the requirements, so I focus on the worst headache.\n\n&gt;**$me:** The Self-Service platform we use only works with daily increments. \n\n&gt;**$HRD:** Are you saying it can't be done?\n\n&gt;**$me:** I'm fairly certain that it's not intended for vacations in hourly increments, but I'll check what can be done. \n\nWe continue to talk about the details, and the headaches just keep piling up.\n\n&gt;**$me:** To be honest, this sounds really hard to implement. How important is it to get this vacation on the platform?\n\n&gt;**$clerk:** An automated process would save a lot of time in cases where the employee applies under certain circumestances.\n\n&gt;**$me:** How many of those cases do we have in a year?\n\n&gt;**$Clerk:** We have about three or four applications like that.\n\nAt this point it might be important to note that the hospital has well over a thousand employees. Given that information, I made a naive suggestion.\n\n&gt;**$me:** Maybe it would be better to start with the other vacations for now and focus on how best to implement [extra special kind of vacation] after the project.\n\n&gt;**$HRD:** Why would we do that?\n\n&gt;**$me:** To implement this vacation sounds like a lot of effort for restricted benefit. Projects often suffer from feature bloat-\n\n&gt;**$HRD:** You don't need to tell me that! I know projects. If we don't digitalize this topic entirely, we might as well not do it at all!\n\n&gt;**$me:** I'm sorry sir, but I don't see it that way.\n\n&gt;**$HRD:** Keep your opinion to yourself then! You are a service provider. You are here to fulfill our requests.\n\nThe silence was palpable.\n\n&gt;**$me:** ...understood.\n\nUntil the end of the meeting, the athmosphere felt like a disciplinary committee. I did my best not to offend any further, just asked for clarifications on some points and took my leave. For the months before this meeting, I had been quite enthusiastic about working together with the HR department. Now I understood that $HRD didn't quite see the IT department as valued colleagues. \n\nAs I left the room together with $Clerk, we both exhaled audibly.\n\n&gt;**$me:** What was that?\n\n&gt;**$Clerk:** Oh, he can be that way sometimes. You'll get used to it.",

We asked again, and magically one of the boxes gained 12 ports. We checked his computer's port and told him that he needed to move the cable to another port. He did. In the wrong direction. We asked him to do it again, but this time to the opposite end of the switch. He did. Oddly, his intranet permissions stayed with him to that port. We asked him to move it to another port. It did. We couldn't ping the computer. We asked him to reboot the computer, still couldn't ping it. We asked him to ipconfig, his IPv4 address wasn't configured for our network.\n\nWe finally asked him to move it one more time, which caused him to still have the half permissions. However, we were almost an hour into the call and he said that the Office365 info wasn't super important, just the shipping label. So we made sure he could print the label. He could.\n\nSo, an hour after the phone call started, through frustration and hundreds of steps taken between the location of the computer and server room, we were finally able to print one measly shipping label. I hope he learned his lesson. Honestly, at the end of the day, I'm just glad  the wall jack was labeled correctly.",

When you do this, the device will ask for your passcode.\n\n**$User:** What the hell is a passcode? \n\n**$Me:** It's what you use to get into your phone, when you unlock it you should usually enter a passcode.\n\n**$User:** I don't know what you're talking about, but I've had this phone for 5 years and I have never had a passcode. \n\n&gt;His device was an iPhone 6. I checked the purchase date in our internal database, he's had the phone for a little less than 3 years. I didn't say anything of course, before I could say a word about what his passcode might be, he wants to troubleshoot on his own\n\n**$User:** But you know what, I'm gonna try some things. Give me a few minutes and I'll call back in to keep trying to fix this damn thing.\n\n**$Me:** Okay sir, thank you you for contacting us today, we will await your call\" \n\n&gt;About 20 minutes and 1 call later, I just so happen to be the rep he connects to again. He's made absolutely zero progress. \n\n**$Me:** Can you go ahead and try hitting the lock button on the right side of your phone? And hit it again when the screen goes black so we can get back into your phone.\n\n**User:** Okay, I entered my pin and now what? Now it's still asking me for my damn passcode.\n\n**$Me:** Try your pin, sir. \n\nYes, his WiFi worked when his phone was back on. \n\nEDIT: words.",

The thing is, this particular report is run from a reporting system which my team can't access or do anything about. We get lots of these so the process is pretty much to call the user, get the report specifics, and tell them that I'm forwarding the ticket to the appropriate group.\n\n**$me:** Hi $user, could you tell me how you're getting to this report so that I can get some specifics about it? \n\n**$user:** Well it's on my computer and I go into the blue \"e\"  *eyeroll*\n\n**$me:** ok, no problem. Let's make this easier. Could you open the report, and copy paste the URL to me in our Skype message? \n\n**$user:** I don't know how to do that.\n\n**$me:** I can walk you through it, could you open the report? \n\n**$user:**No, I don't know how to copy paste. \n\n&gt; At this point, I realize I just need to remote in and open the report myself.\n\n**$me:** Alright I'm going to set up a remote session quick. One moment. \n\n**$user:** No, I don't know how to copy paste.\n\n**$me:** .... I'll teach you how when I get remoted in. \n\n*I browse to the report and I see the print screen menu flash quickly and the print button clicked* \n\n**$me:** did you just print that? \n\n**$user:** yes, I need to remember all the steps you're doing. \n\n**$me:** Just hang tight and I'll teach you how to copy and paste. You won't need to print anymore for that. \n\n**$user:** ok\n\n&gt; Each step of the way to get the info from this report, the user hits print screen and clicks the print button. I'm mad about how much ink that requires, but hey, it's their ink I guess. I finally get the info I need, update the ticket, and start on showing her how to copy paste.\n\n**$me:** It's as simple as that. Right click and copy the thing you want, and right click paste it into OneNote. \n\n**$user:** oh my goodness. That's amazing. This is going to make my job so much easier!\n\n**$me:** yep, it sure will\n\n**$user:** No you don't understand. I've spent so much time printing out my reports, cutting them and rubber cementing them onto a page to fax them to myself. There are times that people have been waiting on me just because it takes so long to put it together! Thank you so much for showing me this!\n\nNo. Way. I helped a user that was **literally** making physical copies of documents, cutting out the contents she wanted with scissors, and pasting it onto another sheet of paper, only to be faxed to herself to save on her machine. I checked my watch to look at the date to make sure I didn't fall into some timewarp to the past. How many ~~days~~ *years* has this been going on for?! \n\nTL;DR; User calls in with issue. I teach her how to copy paste. Find out she was physically copying and pasting documents on her desk to be faxed.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "LTL;FTP Hi everyone! Figured I’d start to chronicle my own experiences through IT, and what better places for all these whoppers than TFTS! Turns out, I’ve been \\(un\\)lucky enough to do/see some REALLY odd\\-ball things \\(and it hasn’t even been that long since I got into this game\\). Fortunately, I when I started really developing in this field, I had some amazing people to show me the ropes. Now, without further ado, here are the players!\n\n$8l4ck83rry – a “relative” newbie to IT; experienced carried over from military service, but not a whole lot of use when it comes to consumer electronics\n\n$PokeTrainer – kindest, sweetest man anyone may ever meet; technically my “superior” based off of time with company\n\n$Pineapple – Truly, a magic man\n\n$DirtyClient – hopefully, self\\-explanatory\n\n$PHB \\(Pointy Haired Boss\\) – both a reference to the boss from Dilbert AND a direct comparison to what happens when someone who doesn’t know IT gets put in charge of an IT department\n\n\\*At this time in my career, I’m relatively new to IT. I joined up for a logistics/customer service/support role, and expected to do NO troubleshooting or IT duties, although that didn’t last long\\*\n\nThe day itself started like any other day. I woke up about 30 minutes before my shift started, put on my Mormon\\-looking, short\\-sleeved, white shirt, my clip\\-on tie, and my name tag, and headed on down the road to my place of work \\(I’ll let you all guess what $ABC company I’m referencing here is\\). At the time, I was attached to the IT repair/customer service department as the logistics employee, so it was my job to inspect all devices that needed to be sent to our service center for damage, ensure that it was properly noted, then package them so that they’d survive shipping, all the while keeping a paper trail. The city itself catered almost entirely to oil field personnel, and their living conditions were not always the most sanitary.\n\nAbout an hour into my shift, $DirtyClient walks up:\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Good afternoon! Welcome to $Company, how can I help you today?\n\n$DirtyClient: Hi. My speakers don’t work, and I want to get them replaced.\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Ok, I’d be happy to help with that. Do you have the speakers with you?\n\n$DirtyClient: Yeah, here they are.\n\n\\*Looks over device, then pulls up $DirtyClient’s warranty info\\*\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Sorry, but it looks like this isn’t eligible for immediate replacement. We’ll have to send this out to be serviced instead.\n\n$DirtyClient: But I bought the warranty.\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Yes, but the terms of it state that you’re entitled to a repair, not a replacement.\n\n$DirtyClient: I don’t want that. I want something done now!\n\n$8l4ck83rry: I’m sorry for the inconvenience. I can check this in for you now, so that we can get started on it, if you’d like.\n\n$DirtyClient: I’d like to speak with your supervisor.\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Ok. Give me one minute, and I’ll get $PHB\n\nI head back to the workshop and radio for $PHB to come over. When $PHB arrives, I explain the situation, and $PHB begins the show of “I’m sorry for your experience” and “We’ll have this done as soon as we can”.\n\nAfter everything is entered, I hand over a claim check, and take the device to the staging area for inspection and processing. This is when things went a little sideways.\n\nThe day itself was rather busy, so the equipment sat in the shipping area for about an hour. Finally, I was able to get free, and proceeded to document the physical condition of all the equipment… and then it happened; a black dot seemingly moves out of, and then back into, one of the crevasses on the speaker I’m currently inspecting. At first, I think it’s my eyes playing tricks on me \\(who hasn’t seen a tiny dot sudden appear then disappear\\), but then it happens again, and again. At this point, I lean in for a closer look, and then recoil in disgust.\n\nAs is turns out, the entire tower speaker assembly was infested with tiny cockroaches. $DirtyClient somehow decided that Cheeto dust wouldn’t ever be a problem for electronics, because this device had it caked in every conceivable nook and cranny.\n\n\\*stares in disbelief\\*\n\n$8l4ck83rry: NOPE!!!\n\n\\*walks away and grabs $PokeTrainer\\*\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Will you take a look at this?\n\n$PokeTrainer: What is it? It’s just a speaker tower. What’s up?\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Just wait…\n\n\\*a few seconds go by, then 4 more cockroaches squirm out of the cracks\\*\n\n$PokeTrainer: Are those cockroaches?!?\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Yeah, pretty sure\n\n$PokeTrainer: OhMyGod!!! Dude!!! Give that thing back to the customer!!!\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Can’t. They already left the store.\n\n$PokeTrainer: Well, we can’t have it back here!!! They’ll spread to every other device!!! Who’s the customer?!?\n\n$8l4ck83rry: It’s $DirtyClient. They spoke with $PHB and said they wanted a new one. $PHB said we would give them a new one if we couldn’t get it fixed. It’s covered in their warranty.\n\n$PokeTrainer: But roaches aren’t!!! Go grab $PHB. We need to find out what to do about this! And try and contact $DirtyClient! This is sooo gross!\n\nAbout 90 minutes pass while trying to grab $PHB. Apparently, $PHB felt like things that didn’t need to be counted, needed to be counted \\(by hand\\).\n\n$PHB: Hey, what’s up?\n\n$PokeTrainer: Hey, so $DirtyClient came by and dropped this home theater system off, and it’s filled with roaches…\n\n$PHB: What…? That doesn’t sound right. What did $Pineapple say?\n\n$8l4ck83rry: We didn’t check with him. We figured, since you are our boss, and the last one to speak with $DirtyClient, you should be the one to decide.\n\n$PHB: Did you get in touch with $DirtyClient?\n\n$8l4ck83rry: We tried, but no answer.\n\n$PHB: Well then, I guess we gotta ship it off…\n\n$PokeTrainer: But $PHB, it has roaches in it\n\n$PHB: I know. We’ll just have to figure something out\n\n\\*$PHB leaves to go count how many emails are currently inside corporate email account that haven’t been read\\*\n\n$8l4ck83rry: So what do we do? This is disgusting…\n\n$PokeTrainer: I know. Let’s go ask $Pineapple. He knows policy pretty well. He’ll know what to do.\n\n\\*shouting to other end of workshop\\*\n\n$PokeTrainer: Hey $Pineapple!!! Can you take a look at this?\n\n$Pineapple: Sure. What’s up?\n\n$PokeTrainer: There’s cockroaches in this home theater system\n\n$Pineapple: \\*chuckles\\* heh heh gross… Is the client still here?\n\n$8l4ck83rry: No, they already left.\n\n$Pineapple: Did you try calling them?\n\n$8l4ck83rry: Yeah, no answer.\n\n$Pineapple: Well, we are NOT sending that out.\n\n$8l4ck83rry: But $PHB said…\n\n$Pineapple: No. That is not covered by anything that we do. We can’t fix that. They have to come pick it up.\n\n$PokeTrainer: But what do we do with it while we wait?\n\n$Pineapple: I don’t know… wrap it up with shrink wrap…?\n\n\\*both 8l4ck83rry and PokeTrainer shrug and agree\\*\n\nNow, this is a full, 5 piece home theater set, and it’s the largest one we offered, so the smallest piece was the size of a beach ball. After 3 rolls of cellophane, rolling each piece of this set like a dung beetle rolls a ball of dung, we had everything sealed air tight. Then, $PHB shows back up.\n\n$PHB: Hey, what’s that?\n\n$PokeTrainer: The home theater system, that was infested with cockroaches…\n\n$PHB: Oh! So it’s ready to ship?\n\n$8l4ck83rry: No. We wrapped it up so that the cockroaches wouldn’t get out. We’re not sending to the service center, since they wouldn’t work on it.\n\n$PHB: Who told you that…?\n\n$Pineapple: I did. This thing is disgusting, and the service center would send it back, then charge us for wasting their time with something that is completely outside the scope of what they can work on\n\n$PHB: Oh.

        "text": "This is probably the last of my stories about University Boss.  And it was his most epic \"save the day\" accomplishment while I was there.\n\n**Me**: PFY (jr. systems administrator and support guy) in the Computer Science (CS) Department of a large university.\n\n**Boss**: Sr. CS sysadmin, my boss, and effortless genius at solving bureaucratic and people problems.\n\n**Sandy**: Finance admin.  I don't even remember her name so I'm calling her Sandy.  One of boss's \"friends in low places\" that he liked to brag about.\n\n**Setting**: Late 90s, the midst of the tech boom.\n\nCS enrollment had been skyrocketing, but the department struggled to keep up financially.  Finally one spring, our budget was looking better and Boss and I were planning out some desperately-needed upgrades to servers, desktops, and labs.  As we were about to place orders, the President of the University issued a memo that ran something like this:\n\n&gt; The University is having a cash flow problem.  An analysis has shown dramatic growth in spending for new computers.  Therefore, effective immediately, there is a University-wide freeze on all purchases of computers.  There will be no exceptions.\n\nOf COURSE there was a dramatic growth in PC purchases.  This was the late 90s, when they went from things some people used to things everybody needed.\n\nAnd it it was bad.  REALLY bad.  As if the Windows 3.1 lab wasn't embarrassing enough, we expected the servers to be completely and utterly unable to handle the load for fall semester.  The chair of the department made a heroic effort to make the case to administration that we were the freaking *Computer* Science department, but made no progress.  So, as usual, it fell to Boss.\n\nBoss called up Sandy in finance.  Boss always helped her out with things, and she helped us out too.\n\n&gt; Boss: ....  so can we buy used computers?\n\n&gt; Sandy: No.\n\n&gt; Boss: Is the money still in our budget?\n\n&gt; Sandy: Yes.\n\n&gt; Boss: So we can still spend the money, just not on computers?\n\n&gt; Sandy: Right.\n\n&gt; Boss: Do they realize how idiotic this is?  It won't save any money, will it?\n\n&gt; Sandy: Of course not.  If the President had asked me, I'd have told him it was stupid.  But nobody ever asks me.  I hear the Board loved his initiative.\n\n&gt; Boss: ...\n\n&gt; Boss: Are we allowed to build a new computer from parts?\n\n&gt; Sandy: No.  That's playing with fire.\n\n&gt; Boss: Are we still allowed to replace parts in existing computers if they have problems?\n\n&gt; Sandy: Yes.\n\nBoss got off the phone with Sandy with a grin.\n\n&gt; Boss: I need you to write a program to test the disks on the main servers.  Take the statistics you have for how much space each account uses, plus our projected enrollment rates for fall.  Write test data that uses that amount of space.\n\n&gt; Me: Uhm, why am I doing this?\n\n&gt; Boss: To solve all our problems, of course.\n\nI was in the dark, but I knew enough to trust Boss by this point.\n\n&gt; Me: Uh, OK.  But I think we won't have enough space.\n\n&gt; Boss: That's fine.  Run it and let me know what happens.\n\nSo I wrote the program, ran it, and got the predictable \"out of space\" error.  Boss promptly fired off an order for some larger hard drives to replace the ones that were \"generating errors during testing.\"  Ah ha, so THAT'S his plan!\n\nPretty soon we tested the memory against the projected load, and wouldn't you know it, we got more errors!  But the motherboard wouldn't support enough RAM, so we needed a new motherboard -- and therefore a new CPU -- also.  Maybe even a new power supply.\n\nBut never a new case.  And most definitely, never never never was I to touch the inventory sticker.  If I did, someone might think we had purchased a new computer!\n\nSo, many of these machines had entirely new guts, just saving their original cases and floppy drives (and sometimes power supplies).\n\nWe upgraded all of our most critical servers and two labs full of desktop PCs this way.  By the end of summer, we had almost all of what we wanted in the first place, which was good enough.  Nobody ever questioned it, and if they had, I'm quite sure Boss had filed away all these test reports to justify \"replacing the faulty components.\"  He didn't violate the rule -- instead, he made sure to document how carefully he was following it.\n\nAnd that is how a presidential memo led to the documented failure of hundreds of sticks of RAM, dozens of motherboards, and who knows how many hard drives, all within the period of a few months.\n\nI've never seen anything like it.",

        "text": "Pre-text: I’m an electrical engineer who supports induction furnaces. Our furnaces melt anywhere from 1 ton to 100 tons of metal at a time down from scrap metal for foundries. Not your typical tech support. \n\nWhen I visit these foundries, I often have to review their safety material. Standard kinda stuff that they give out to contractors before permitting they do work. Often times the bigger companies do this to limit liability and the smaller don’t. \n\nI was at a medium sized plant in Wisconsin about to do some support on a holding furnace. Before I am allowed to do work I have to review their safety material and sign a few sheets. Kinda standard stuff at plants approaching this size.\n\nAs I am flipping through the book I get to the safety section regarding their melters and something peaks my interest. Normally, they’re pretty repetitive, but this page had one rule that I’ve never seen anywhere else: “No water on the operating deck. All water must be in the operators room. This includes spit.”\n\nWhat? Spit. Why did it have to specify spit? So I ask the maintenance supervisor. \n\n“Oh well this is something you’ve gotta hear. We had an operator who liked to chew tobacco. Not really an issue as he kept his spit bottle in the operator room. Disgusting, but whatever. He showed up and did his job.\n\nUntil one day, he decided to put the spit bottle in the pocket of his shirt as he did his job. At first it wasn’t an issue, until toward the end of the shift when it got more and more full. \n\nYou see he opened the furnace to check temperature visually. As he bent over it spilled out into the furnace. BOOM. Metal flew everywhere. He died in seconds. His body was 90% covered in iron. \n\nThe kicker was his family sued afterwards. They argued that the no water rule was vague and he didn’t know it applied to spit.”\n\nFace meet desk. \n\n“They got 2 million and the lawyers had us add the phrase to our safety manuals.”\n\nEdit: Since there’s multiple questions. Iron is typically 2200 plus degrees F. Water pours into furnace and vaporizes near instantly after getting in contact with the metal. This causes the water to expand and steam. Metal goes along for a ride. Example: https://youtu.be/78CBUcGtfOs",

I work in a bulk laptop repair facility that does repairs for public and private institutions. \n\n\nI recently encountered a weird issue that even our QA guru had never seen.\n\n\nLaptop came in, note said \"glitchy video playback when top is closed\".\n\n\nNow at first glance this might appear stupid. But this customer routinely uses laptops as though they were desktops. Why? I have no idea. They're usually set up on a docking station with an external monitor plugged in as well as keyboard and mouse.\n\n\nGet the unit, boot into the inboard diagnostics mode and nothing seems wrong. So I send it back to QA with \"unable to replicate reported issue, no parts used\".\n\n\nNow this unit isn't for the average user. It's for a more self-important class of user, so it gets extra scrutiny from QA. They boot the thing up using a test drive (with this class of user, the user drives aren't sent in with the unit. Sometimes even if the drive is the reported issue) and confirm that when you have video playing to an external monitor and close the top, the unit freaks completely. \n\n\nVideo playback gets an extreme drop in framerate, audio gets distorted to hell.\n\n\nThey try everything from replacing the pcb separate from the motherboard that handles external video, all the way to the CPU.\n\n\nLong story short, it was the pcb that houses the wifi switch and lid sensor that was malfunctioning. \n\n\nNever seen anything like it. I've seen them malfunction and result in the unit not seeing any wifi networks.\n\n\nAlthough it will always bother me more that they use these laptops as makeshift desktops. Mainly because of the breakage rate resulting in them not really being cheaper.\n\n\nEdit: forget to include small detail on what QA replaced when doing their diagnostics. ",

        "text": "So starting off lets define who the involved parties are.\n\n@me \\- well me the Security Guard\n\n@tech1 \\- Tech guy for the shift\n\n@tech2 \\- cause of the issue\n\nSo I work at a facility that deals with money, and we have \"guests\" at all times \\(24Hx7D\\). Whenever we have a machine that goes down @me or another security personnel must be present while the machine is open. Also this machine in question when you open it, it opens towards the ceiling with the screen pointed up.\n\n@me and @tech1 went to class together for Cisco Networking.\n\nI am standing by the door greeting and making sure all the guests who enter are of age when I get the call to meet @tech1 at a machine. Upon my arrival he tells @me that the touch screen is not working. So I do my duty I watched him work. So first thing @tech1 does is the typical troubleshoot, Unplugs and plugs it back in. And Walla the touch screen was working. So he thought, he closes the machine and goes to log out of the admin panel. No response. So we go on this hour long troubleshooting to no avail. @tech1 was able to deduce that when it was open it worked but when closed it stopped working. So he believed it was ether the power cable or the USB cable. While @tech1 was attempting to trace the wires I noticed that the USB hub had letters on each cable. I wait a few minutes just watching him trace the cable and loose where he was a few times and I casually mention \"you would think with this many cables they would have them labeled.\" Needless to say after I mentioned that he found that there were indeed labeled and concurred that the USB cables were not the issue upon testing. @tech1 was at his wits end of the issue so I asked him when the problem started. He told me today after @tech2 installed the new screen. So we both came to the conclusion that the screen itself may be the problem. But problem is no other screens available to test this theory so he starts to close the system. As he is closing I notice the screen move. I mention this to @tech1 and he opens it back up and inspects and realizes a screw was missing at the bottom left. He tells me it is no big deal should not be and issue. So I reply, well if the touch screen works while system is open, and stops working while it is closed, and to shutdown/restart the system the door must be open. There is not any pressure on the bottom left of the touch screen upon restart and when you close it, it will apply pressure to the screen so since it did not have that pressure to begin with it is going to tell the computer someone is pushing on that area which will in fact make the touchscreen seem non responsive when it is closed.\" @tech1 replies \"I didn't think about that, let me install a new screw real quick\" After he installs the screw, the screen becomes completely unresponsive and he the says, \"well that's probably why @tech2 did not install the screw, because it is not responsive at all now.\" @me with my genius thought told @tech1 to restart the system with the screw installed. After bootup screen worked perfect. He closed the machine, exited admin menu with no issue, then turned to me and said \"I can't believe one screw would cause this much of an Issue.\"\n\nTL/DR: @tech2 failed to install a screw which caused the touchscreen to not work. @me told @tech1 to install a screw to fix it.",

        "text": "No fanfare for this one. No embellishments. Just simple fact for this one as it was a huge facepalm when this happened. \n\nI am up in *another city* this week for a summit at headquarters. This was a situation where a tier 1 support walked into a room and did something that people who knew 7 million programming languages, centuries of experience, and hundreds of degrees and certs could not fix. (Ok I may embellish a little bit.)\n\nWe were in all area manager meeting with over 100 people at the meeting. The Cs, Ps, and EVPs, were all up on stage and the CEO was giving the presentation. Now keep in mind this is not a giant auditorium, more of a large conference room. \n\nThe CEO starts clicking and clicking and clicking some more. He sighs and says his laptop is lagging again. Without missing a beat the area manager for the engineers stands up and goes to his PC. He starts running some network tests, other people are testing the physical location, and others still are trying to offer suggestions like a bunch of imperial commanders trying to impress Darth Vader. \n\nThe comical scene unfolded for a bunch of senior programmers, system admins, exchange admins, and basically anyone who is \"smarter\" than the help desk all started scratching their heads. \n\nI silently walked up to the podium, grabbed a double A energizer out of the pack on the table, and replaced the battery in his wireless mouse. I flipped the switch off and on again telling him to try it now. The look on his face can only be one of doubt to genuine surprise as the lag went immediately away as soon as he tried clicking again. I heard a sigh from behind me and looked to see the face of the sysadmin. His, and everyone else's expression simply said \"Im dumb\" as they shook their heads and sat back down. \n\nThe CEO shook my hand and asked for my name. He thanked me and went back to his presentation. \n\nWhen I went back to my seat, I typed up the ticket for what I did for the ceo putting the ticket with him as the requester and me as the tech. I typed everything out in the notes including the failure of the yes men. Since the ticket had the name of the ceo on it, my inbox blew up with notifications of notes being added to the ticket. A bunch of \"lolol\" or simply \"Wooooooooooow\" or my personal favorite from the CIO himself. \"Never forget the basics people. Thank you Thelightningcount1\" All within the 10 minutes it took me to type this one out from my seat at the conference. ",

        "text": "So I work for a fairly large company which offers corporate network security products. We offer a product, and we support that product in case it breaks, but we do not contract administration of that product.\n\nBasically, you buy the product and we assume that you are competent enough to hire someone who understands basic networking and knows enough about your network to do simple administration of an intrusion prevention system.\n\nMonths ago, a customer called in with several issues, all of which I either resolved \\(in scope\\) or provided them with adequate, official documentation to explain in simple steps how to resolve \\(out of scope, local admins task\\).\n\nA few weeks ago, a sev 2 ticket comes in. My manager messages me. I'm already in a remote session with a client so I can't really respond to it, but I see the client name and \"sev 2\" pop up in the title and something tells me this isn't going to be good.\n\nSo I open the email, and check the ticket. The description was basically this:\n\n\"You told us to run some commands in mysql and we did and now our database is 0kb\"\n\nObviously I entered a state of quiet panic. I can't say or do anything because I'm on a remote with a client, but in every spare second, every single moment where I don't have to actively do something in the remote, I'm sifting through the old cases, emails and conversations I had with this client, trying to figure out what I fucked up.\n\nAfter 10 minutes of panic, one of the senior engineers picks up the case, as I am still occupied. I sit, try to focus, and continue to panic internally.\n\nAnother 15 minutes pass, my call ends. I sit in anticipation of the shame that comes with fucking something up and realising you are not fit for the role you were hired to perform. I look over at the senior engineers desk, and start listening to his conversation with one of the other senior engineers. I'll call the guy who took the case SE1 and the guy who he was talking to SE2. It went like this:\n\nSE1: Dude.. Check this out. In their MySQL directory, they have like five mysql.exe files. One of them is spelled \"myqls.exe and one is spelled myslq.exe\".\n\nSE2: Wait what? Why? What happened?\n\nSE1: Well, they're saying their database is 0Kb, but I think they've renamed their MySQL executable. Check this out, there's a file named mysql.exeOLD which is about the same size as their DB executable should be.\n\nSE2: Wait, mysql OLD?\n\nSE1: Yeah, hold on, let me ask them what commands they're talking about which ruined their database\n\nAt this point I'm basically looking over the shoulder of SE1. I watch. Carefully. He asks them to repeat the commands I provided, in the most simply and straight forward way I knew.\n\nThey logged in to MySQL. That was it. That was the command they said had destroyed their database. It's also worth noting, that they logged in to MySQL incorrectly.\n\nWhat had happened was, our product has a database. A small part of client\\-side administration of the product can include running very simple MySQL commands on that database. They had such terrible knowledge of it that instead of actually following the steps that I had produced, they seemingly troubleshot a MySQL database in the same way that a level one service desk agent would troubleshoot an Outlook issue.\n\nTo quote the senior engineer:\n\n\"It seems like they read what you typed, and started troubleshooting based off what their own rough idea was of what you were talking about, without actually following the steps you provided\".\n\nSo, he renamed the \\*actual\\* mysql.exe file, deleted the new one the client had created, and the issue resolved itself.\n\nAnd that is the story of how everything will always be your fault, no matter what, until the day you stop working in IT.",

No rejection errors, no message received entries. NOTHING. Their application didn't SEND email, so of course nothing was received.  \n  \nThey check the application logs, and there's an error. Permission denied. Well, that would have been nice to know. The mail client is configured to connect to mailhost.*COMPANY*.com. This hostname resolves in DNS to 127.0.0.1. All mail applications connect to the local sendmail daemon.  \n  \nSo, this is obviously an application problem, right? Except node 2 doesn't match node 1. /etc/hosts doesn't have localhost listed for 127.0.0.1 on node 2.  I edit the file to fix this, asking myself what IDIOT deleted it...and discover that it wasn't deleted...it was MOVED to the primary interface IP address entry.  \n  \nThat's right, folks! localhost resolves to the IP address of the host. Because the previous admins had a crack habit. Postfix is configured to bind to \"localhost\", but the mail app is trying to connect to 127.0.0.1. Which it can't because postfix is not listening on that address.  I fix the entry and restart postfix, and now the application works.  \n  \n  \nThis is endemic of a larger problem: the previous admins just did shit for *reasons*. Mostly because they were lazy and didn't want to do work. But this? Who the hell changes the localhost entry? I'll tell you who: people who have NO business ever touching a UNIX system. Like, EVER.

Can you please describe in your own words what exactly you are trying to do?\"\n\n$User - \"**re: Please help!** Tomorrow, then, if you have time.\"\n\n$Me - \"**re: Please help!** But what is it you are trying to do??\"\n\n$User - *(crickets)*\n\nI still haven't heard anything back from her.  I can't wrap my mind around what is so difficult about TRYING to describe what it is you're wanting to accomplish.  I can't freaking stand \"let me just show you\" requests with no information, because my office is half a mile away from everyone else and I don't like making double trips for tools or materials to solve a problem that hadn't been clearly described in the first place, not to mention most of these things can be resolved with an email or a phone call.  \n\nI try really hard not to baby users when they act this helpless.  You're a teacher, for crying out loud...use your words! I can't help you if I don't understand your goal!",

        "text": "My company was bought out by a larger company over a year ago and since then has been making a slow, steady conversion over to their systems. The most recent of which being an email migration where we're moving all of our company's emails to the new one's servers. Before it happened they sent out a company-wide email with instructions on how to install the new version of Office and activate it. Not a single goddamn person RTFE. Every single one of them has spent the last month calling in so we could read the instructions for them. People call in angry that they had to wait for an hour to get to us and it's made a job I actually kind of enjoyed stressful and draining, like a factory of misery.\n\nBut every now and then we get a legitimate issue with the migration, where someone followed the instructions but it still broke. I got one such call from a lady flagged as VIP in the system. I was almost kind of relieved to see that. So far VIPs had been polite, easy to work with, and had their shit together—the opposite of what I'd expected coming into this company. But VIP WITCH—VW for short—as we'll call her apparently skipped whatever common courtesy training everyone else got.\n\nImmediately she demanded that I remote into her computer because she didn't have time to tell me what was wrong. So I get into her computer and open up to her Outlook and immediately see the issue: In the header of Outlook it shows her old pre-migration email address rather than her new one. The settings carried over from the previous install of Outlook which causes permission conflicts somehow. She confirmed this by demonstrating that her issue was that every time she tried to book a conference room, it gave her some sort of access denied kickback email—an issue I literally just easily described in one sentence.\n\n&gt;**Me:** See at the top there? It shows your old email address, not your new one. That's what's causing the issue. We'll just have to rebuild your Outlook profile to fix it.\n\n&gt;**VW:** I don't believe you. My Outlook has worked *fine* for an entire week like this, I don't think that's the solution.\n\n&gt;**Me:** I understand that. Most of the time it does work for a little bit for most people, but eventually it starts having issues with calendar permissions like you're having now. That eventually degrades to the point where Outlook gets stuck in a disconnected status. I just want to fix this for you so you don't run into bigger problems later.\n\n&gt;**VW:** Are you even listening to me? *It's. Been. Working. Fine. Until. Now.* That cannot be the solution, I have too many shared calendars and mailboxes and I don't want to lose them all and have to set them up again.\n\n&gt;**Me:** No, I understand your hesitation. I'll definitely note them all and set them back up for you, it shouldn't take too lo—\n\n&gt;**VW:** No. *No.* Profile rebuilds are just what IT does when they have *no idea what they're doing.* My friend told me profile rebuilds were just awful. Don't you have someone there who knows what they're actually doing that I can talk to?\n\nI grit my teeth and tried and force it into a smile. She just called my competency into question. I can be patient as a goddamn saint while people scream at me—they're mostly just stressed because the issue is affecting their job performance. But personal attacks against my competency make me incredibly angry.\n\n&gt;**Me:** I'm an experienced agent, I've been with this help desk for a year. I've done this dozens of times. It's solved the issue every time and there isn't any other documented solution right now. I apologize that it will take up some of your time to complete, b—\n\n&gt;**VW:** Is there a manager I can speak with?\n\n&gt;**Me:** I can definitely get you a manager. They'll follow the same process and steps I have to, howe—\n\n&gt;**VW:** Manager. *Now.*\n\nI politely and calmly informed her, despite my seething, indignant anger lurking beneath the surface, that I would be putting her on hold for a few minutes. I then walked over to my supervisor's(SUP) desk and informed him of what was going on. He asked me to message him the name of the person and ticket number, and have her leave a message on his voicemail because he was busy right then. I walked back and complied, messaging him the info and letting her know she could leave him a voicemail and he'd call back when he was available.\n\n&gt;**VW:** You're telling me he's not available to talk to me *now*?\n\nShe said this in such a way that implied she was actually taken aback, like some peasant had dared turn down the queen for teatime.\n\n&gt;**VW:** I need this solved now. You tell him once he solves that issue, I have two more issues that need looking at.\n\n&gt;**Me:** While we're waiting for him, I could definitely look into those for you if you'd like?\n\nShe wasn't having it. We went back and forth for a few minutes, her insisting that she speak with him now while I tried to appease her and just get her off my phone. My supervisor messaged me back.\n\n&gt;**SUP:** I knew it.\n\n&gt;**SUP:** I knew it as soon as you said the thing about you not knowing what you're doing.\n\n&gt;**SUP:** I just knew it would be her.\n\nThere was a pause, then as if with resignation, another message.\n\n&gt;**SUP:** Tell her I'm available now.\n\n&gt;**SUP:** I'll take the call\n\n&gt;**Me:** Alright, sorry about this.\n\n&gt;**SUP:** It's not your fault.\n\nI transferred the call and had the decency to not press him for how it went after. I swear in the time that entire exchange took place the profile rebuild would have already been done and I would have been working on the next issue.\n\n",

        "text": "Hello TFTS,\n\nSecond little story I'm posting here tonight, but I think that it's worth sharing. It happened yesterday, and it all started by a phone call to our office.\n\n$Me =&gt; Myself\n\n$CU =&gt; Clueless User (quite appropriate in this situation)\n\n&gt; $Me: Hello, IT Support.\n\n&gt; $CU: Yes I need you to send someone immediately to $MeetingRoom because I can't connect to the TV screens.\n\n&gt; $Me: Okay, how exactly are you trying to connect your laptop ? Are you using the USB cable, the HDMI cable or the wireless system ?\n\n&gt; $CU: I don't know, I've no clue ! (slight laugh)\n\n&gt; $Me: Okay we're going to send someone then.\n\n&gt; $CU: Please send someone immediately because the meeting will start in less than ten minutes !\n\n&gt; $Me: We're going to send someone.\n\n&gt; $CU: Thanks.\n\nWe have about 30 meeting rooms here, with the same equipment in each room. Users can use an HDMI cable, a USB cable or a wireless system (with the built-in wireless display feature in Windows 10) to connect to TV screens, depending on what they have on their laptops. $CU here has been working with us for more than six months and she's still unable to connect properly to TV screens in meeting rooms, because *\"she doesn't know how to do it\"*.\n\nSo I walk to the meeting room, located at the other extremity of the building to check the issue. I immediately notice that the six TV screens (it's a big room) are turned off, and that $CU plugged both cables (USB and HDMI) to her laptop, and she doesn't understand what's wrong.\n\nI turn on the TV screens, unplug both cables from user's laptop and connect it with the wireless system (which is usually more stable) to the TV screens. $CU then asks me what was wrong, but she probably didn't understand what I was saying, due to the fact that I had just started to talk when she started to talk to her coworker next to her, completely ignoring what I was saying. I left the room, without $CU saying a word or a thanks.",

        "text": "Hello TFTS,\n\nThis story happened a few weeks ago. To give a little bit of context before diving into this story, our company uses a third-party software for Internet security (whitelisting / blacklisting websites, with various profiles depending on user's occupation, so some users can access social networks with their profile, while others have a regular access and can't browse social networks, for example). Since last month, it's now up to our team to manage these profiles for our users, it was outsourced before that.\n\nThis security system is also blocking any FTP links, and this is where our story begins. It all started by a ticket (for once, they sent a ticket, not an email, that's amazing actually).\n\n$Me =&gt; Myself // $User =&gt; The user // $UM =&gt; User's manager\n\n&gt; $User: Hello Team, I need to have access to FTP links so I can download some apps for my work, but I'm being blocked by $Software. Please give me the profile $FTP_Profile\n\n&gt; $Me: Hello $User, I've checked in our AD and there isn't any group for this profile, it appears that this profile doesn't exist. I'm going to check with the team who was managing that before to see what they can tell me about that.\n\nSo I've contacted the team who was managing profiles and accounts for this system before us, and they told me that there isn't any profile like that, apparently what users are referring to as \"another profile\" is just a process to whitelist FTP links. So I let $User know that instead of a profile, they can only temporarily whitelist the FTP links... so user decides to put his manager in the emails.\n\n&gt; $UM: Hello $Me, I've been told by $User that the profile we're requesting doesn't exist. But I know it does exist because we had requested it two years ago for another user, I still have the form that I'd fulfilled back then.\n\n&gt; $Me: Hello $UM, I understand that, but the process has changed since that date. And as I said to $User, we don't have any AD groups for this profile, I've also been told by the other team that there isn't any profile like that, I've however sent the details to $User for the other process regarding the whitelisting of the FTP links.\n\n\nSo, $UM decides to talk about it to his manager, who decides to send an email (without including our team in the loop of the email, of course) to complain about the IT Team being incompetent as always, and that user's current issue is a big emergency, as he's not able to work *(which isn't true, since $User here knows that he could access these links by switching to the public WiFi network we have here but, meh, it's too boring to do that once to download two or three apps, I guess, however this team is used to send emails like that each time we don't answer as they would like to their requests or simply each time they have an issue. Any kind of issue.)*\n\nIn the end, it turns out that the profile they needed is not the one they were requesting... and this profile isn't granting access to FTP links either.",

        "text": "Reminded by [this post,](https://redd.it/8jux7a) here’s a story from when I was first getting trained on aircraft engines…\n\n***\n\nBecause of the vast differences in background and experience new Soldiers can have, the very beginning of Aircraft Powerplant Training was focused on the basic physics behind jet turbines, their principles of operation, basic tool instruction and safety practices.  Among the various “don’t put your hand in there,” “cover all engine openings to prevent foreign object damage” and “protect your eyes” safety rules, there were several electrical practices that were emphasized to us.  Foremost among those was “prior to working on the exciter, use an INSULATED HANDLE screwdriver to push the electrical lead against the engine case to ground the system, once it is disconnected from the ignitor.”  \n\n&gt;**$RandomTFTSReader** “Zee, what’s an exciter?  And why?”\n\nThanks for asking, $RandomTFTSReader, I’m happy to explain!\n\nAn exciter is essentially a box filled with capacitors used to power an ignitor (spark plug) during engine start and certain operation modes.  The amount of power that comes out exciter is rather large—the instructors emphasized just how dangerous the output was with descriptions of unfortunate mechanics being flung across hangars and off aircraft.  A typical exciter for an [Allison 250]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allison_Model_250) (used in the OH58D Kiowa, Star Vipers and numerous other aircraft) has a peak output current of 825A, peak voltage of 11.3kV and puts out around 10-12 sparks/second with 28VDC input.  \n\nIt’s a bad day in a box no larger than a paperback novel.\n\n***\n\nIt was our second day on the schoolhouse floor actually working engines and [Joey](https://redd.it/71qg4j) and I were assigned to work with one another tearing down an Allison 250.  Because of the design of the engine, one of the very first tasks is removing the ignitor, ignitor lead, and the exciter.  Joey would take that task while I worked on removing the fuel system. I wasn’t paying too much attention to what Joey was doing, so I never saw him disconnect the exciter. One of our instructors did and as I reached out and touched the engine, he shouted at us.\n\n&gt;**Instructor**  “Hey!  ZeeWulf!  Stop! Lie down on the floor, you just died!  Joey, you just killed Zee!”\n\nConfused, I laid down as was instructed.  A second instructor came over and grimly pulled out some chalk with which he proceeded to trace my outline on the floor.  \n\n&gt;**Instructor** “Okay, Zee, get up.  You’re done for the day, you now just have to stand back and haunt Joey as he works alone.”\n\n&gt;**Joey** “What? That’s not fair, what’d I do wrong?”\n\n&gt;**Instructor**  You never grounded out the exciter, and you didn’t warn ZeeWulf you’d disconnected the lead.  You got him killed.  I want you to think long and hard about that.”\n\n***\n\nThe next day I returned to work, but the chalk outline remained—we were responsible for mopping up our area at the end of the day and they’d instructed us to let it stay as a reminder. It wasn’t the only mistake any of us made that week; later that week Shaver and Axe-Man returned from lunch to find every orifice of their engine stuffed with shredded newspaper—they’d forgotten to cap the holes for the ignitor, fuel nozzle and bleed air tubes.  To add insult to injury, the instructor explained that due to their lack of attention to detail, the engine was released and put on Joey’s helicopter and got him killed.  Shaver was instructed to write a letter of notification to ‘Mrs. Joey and family’ and explain how he got ‘her husband’ killed.  \n\nShaver opened it with “To Mrs. Joey and my children…”\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR:** Improper maintenance practices can lead to electric personalities.\n\n*Enjoy what you've read?  [There's more!](https://redd.it/7i0esb)*\n\nEdit: Wow, gold? Thanks u/Ferro_Giconi! \n\nOne More Edit:  So y'all know, the procedure is to ground it out...but the expectation is that there will be no actual 'ZAP'.  The system's SUPPOSED to be discharged already, but this is one of those 'just in case' precautions.  Because I'd rather risk wrecking the ESD components on the aircraft than die.",

We actually don't have any women who work here and your mom said that you took it to Major Cellphone Provider. We are Tech In a Box not Major Cellphone Provider. You are very welcome though to stop by any time and check in your phone for us to take a look at it for you.\n\nS: Thanks.\n\nT: Thank you and have a great day. \n",

They are basically webcams on bendy stalks that can be used to display what the camera is looking at onto the class projector (like homework).

These cameras are supposed to be able to flip the image so the visualiser can be placed on the other side of the paper.\n\n\n\nThe manufactures website has a mighty faqs that, naturally, does not mention this issue in the slightest. So time to dig. And dig. No help in the 1st few sites, then a bunch of adverts to buy the camera I already have. Finally I get somewhere. To flip the camera you nedd to go into $SettingA and check a box. But the box is greyed out so you also need to enable the flip option by going into $SettingB and changing the media format. Test and it works. A quick psr later and I'm emailing the Head of IT the guide. Titled: \"Flipping Camera\"\n\n\n\nTl;dr Shut your flipping face, uncle flipper.",
