        "text": "I am a student who has taken a gap year in the hopes of finding a little more direction in what I want to do in life. I live in the UK so as-well as university, we have apprenticeship schemes offered to us. Firstly, I have completed my A-levels and secured a spot at the University of Liverpool on a foundation year in engineering (I did not do Maths A level) which i then would follow on from into an engineering discipline. This was going to be Aerospace but when the time to go to uni arrived I got cold feet and wondered whether there were better options available to me. Although i know i shouldn’t be, i feel very motivated by salaries as I have a deep passion for Cars and would love to be able to own something impressive in the future (along with the financial freedom of course).  Currently, I see a few options for myself. I could wait it out and attend university next year onto my desired course (i could even go to software engineering if that would benefit me more), or I could try my luck at applying to a Digital and Technology solutions apprenticeship near me at a company called CapGemini, where i would gain a degree in Digital and Technology solutions from Aston University. Or, i could go to BAE systems for an aerospace engineering apprenticeship that awards a Beng in Aerospace Engineering and 2 diplomas. Obviously with both apprenticeships i would have the benefit of free tuition, and experience leading into a job at the corresponding company at the end of the apprenticeship. I would have to move away for Liverpool and the BAE systems routes, so that’s another consideration. I want to make the right choice for my life and not feel like later down the line i could’ve made a better decision by either following into a software role or an aerospace one. I feel consumed by researching “average salaries” for everything i consider and i wonder what the benefit of the “traditional” route would give me. I should also probably note that while i do not know how to code now, id be willing to learn if the compensation of becoming a software engineer is good enough. Also, is there any real world difference between the uni you attend? Is there ANY reason for me to go to Liverpool?\nI honestly appreciate any wisdom anybody has for me, even if that’s telling me to get my head out of the clouds. \n\nTLDR - I’ve got my life ahead of me and the idea of regretting doing one thing or another is consuming me into not doing anything at all. I’ve always been a “science” type of person and i’m just desperate to make the most out of my life.",

I am good at designing, but I have a lot to learn about the actual equipment, operations, etc.  \n\n\nA recruiter reached out to me about a client looking for a senior mechanical engineer. I let her know that I am not a senior level guy, just mid-level, but she still pushed and got me an interview. Turns out the employer is actually one of my current company's biggest clients. I've worked on 3 of their big projects.  \n\n\nWell, the first two interviews were amazing, and they've basically said I am getting an offer but want me to finish this last interview that I have tomorrow.  In the first interview I was honest with the hiring manager and let him know that I am a mid-level engineer with a lot of drafting experience, but more to learn on the technical side.  He told me that I seemed like a great fit regardless. I did a second interview with their senior mechanical engineer, and he did a technical screening of me. He asked me some design and tech questions and I told him what I know and didn't know. Now, I have 1 more interview and they will send an offer. (The hiring manager called me today and let me know I would get one.)  \n\n\nI am freaking out because they still title the position as a Senior position. Also, I currently make $88,500 as a design engineer which is a pretty solid salary for my position and experience. Well, the offer I am getting will be over $115,000, plus a 15% bonus.   \n\n\nThe offer is amazing, but I am freaking out and imposter syndrome is hitting hard. I am very fearful that once I get into the position, they will think it was a big mistake and that I am not at the level they thought I was.  I know I've done well in the interviews, but I still can't help but feel like I am missing something or somehow tricked them.  \n\n\nHas anyone had this happen? How did you get over the fear and what steps did you take to make sure you were successful in a role that you felt was over your head?",

They DO NOT do this test unless it is specifically requested by the customer that we do it. They expect me to just mark this stuff as 'compliant' and leave it at that.\n\nMy position is that the FAI request IS a customer request, as the report is there to demonstrate our process' compliance to those standards. They insist that \"we're able to do that\" and that we don't need to do these tests. It's eating me up. Am I missing something? Should I put my foot down on this, or am I not understanding the point of an FAI report?\n\nIt should be noted that I got hired to drive a truck five years ago and have been doing these reports for a couple years.

I know the relationship between power, torque, and angular speed is P = T * w, so if I know the torque of an engine and it's speed then I know its power output. I also know that if I connect a generator that it will take some of that power and generate electricity, but it will also push back on the power source. How would I calculate some sort of steady state for the output of the generator and the resulting push back on the engine?

When an object has more material located further from the bending axis, it makes it much stiffer.\" By why is it dependent on the *area* that is distributed far from the axis and not the *mass.* \n\nI don't have the same question vice-versa, i.e., why do we use the mass moment of inertia to resist rotation...that intuitively makes sense to me. \n\nCan someone clear this up for me?

Since then, I’ve gathered close to 5 years of experience working in the Electric Utility industry as a distribution design engineer and field engineer for electric construction projects. \n\nI didn’t take the FE after graduating, which I regret, but would like to pursue it soon as my company is trying to motivate the engineers to get their PE. I have a few questions that I hope more experienced engineers in the power industry could help me answer. \n\n1. My first goal is to just pass the FE Exam. Given that it’s been 6-7 years since college, would it be smart to take the FE: Other exam over the Mechanical? I have not used the ME principles since I was in college, most of my work has involved voltage calculations and load analysis since then. \n\n2. Assuming I pass the FE and continue gaining experience in my industry, which PE test should I ready myself for? Ideally I would like to take the Electrical exam, but since I’m worried taking the FE equivalent I can’t imagine how nervous or underprepared I’d be for the PE. \n\nAre there any engineers that found themselves in a similar situation?",

Our big picture hope is to eventually automate the plant.\n\nThe plant does not make these product SKUs to order. Traditional business says that \"20% of your SKUs will provide 80% of your volume\" but I have been pulling years of production data. We have literal hundreds of SKUs and our highest volume product that is made the same way quite literally only made 2.62% of our order volume this year. The products can vary in color number, material, label, outer edge (some are binded, some have glue applied to them) as well as cut size and board. \n\nMost of these products are sub 1% of our annual volume, but we frequently experience monthly shifts in which one product type might be a high runner versus the other.\n\nWith all this mind, how do I determine which products to design for? The pushback that I get from everyone in manufacturing is that the products vary so much and change so frequently that it makes it highly difficult to prioritize automation opportunities. The data seems to back that up. \n\nThe traditional 80/20 rule does not seem to apply, which breaks my brain.",

        "text": "I have a welded rectangular steel box filled with liquid. I know the all dimensions of the box and the steel plates, as well as the “maximum allowable stress values in tension”, which apparently is different than the tensile strength, but I’m not sure how exactly.\n\nWhen filled to the maximum capacity of liquid, the metal sides of the box will warp, but not completely bend. I am trying to gather some idea of the extent of this warping/ballooning mathematically, as a distance measurement. This distance would be the amount of inches that the center of the sheet of metal is offset from its normal plane. How do I calculate this with the data I have? \n\nThen I would like to have a way to tweak this calculation. If I added 2 vertical reinforcing channels to the side of the box, how much would they reduce the bending? I know the section modulus of both the side sheet of steel and the supporting channel. Not sure I entirely understand what the section modulus really IS, but I have calculated it!\n\nI’m not an engineer, I’m a chemist doing some engineering work. I thought I was getting close to solving this problem, but it ended up being a lot more complicated than I thought it would be.\n\nPlease comment if you know how to solve this kind of problem or you have done something similar before. I will be actively responding in the comments so feel free to ask for more information if you need it. I would just like a general idea of how to get these values.",
