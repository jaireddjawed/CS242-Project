        "text": "For context, I have been working with my current AD for over a year. In that span I’ve bought a Cartier Tank Must XL, Rolex DJ41 Wimbledon and Rolex OP31 Turquoise. During the whole time, I’ve asked my AD for one watch more than any, a GMT BLNR for my 40th bday. Fast forward to a month ago, I get offered a Yachtmaster 40. I turned it down as I held my foot down for something I wanted, the BLNR. They offer me a Submariner Starbucks and again, I turn it down because I didn’t vibe with the watch. I’m not a flipper and refuse to play the game of flipping pieces even though I easily could have. Fast forward to today, I casually stop by while in the mall having dinner and they offer me a Starbucks yet again. I say no thanks, as I’m walking out I see the manager who says there’s something there that will make you happy. Behind door number two, you guessed it the BLNR suddenly appears. Initially I was overjoyed, but then reality sank in, they’ve clearly had the piece all along and refused to sell it to me. After talking it through with my wife, I say thanks but no thanks. I’ve spent $20k+ in your store within a year and just mins ago you were trying to sell me something I didn’t want. Then magically the piece I have wanted all along appears. I tell the salesman this isn’t a luxury experience, it was supposed to be a 40th bday gift but the experience is now tainted and there’s no way I’d ever want the watch. This experience has totally turned me off to Rolex. We’ve been told time and time again that there’s scarcity in the market, the fact is there is none. Rolex makes over a million watches a year, as many as swatch makes plastic moon swatches. The AD’s just hide them in a safe to hook people on exclusively. Shame on me for falling for it. As much as I love the watches I’m not sure I’ll ever buy another again. I’ve been fortunate enough to own many luxury watches and none had this experience.",

If I hold it upside-down it works every time, if it's flat it works most of the time but not all the time, and if I hold it face forward and right-side up it pretty much never works. Also, it doesn't work if pressed slowly.  \n\n\nAnyone know what could be causing this? I'm assuming it's a problem with the reed switch, and I'm not sure if it's even fixable outside of replacing the switch or module completely which I definitely am not able to do, but I'm just wondering if there's some obscure fix I'm missing, or something.",
