He told me that he'd gladly do it and he wouldn't even consider me paying for something like this :)  \n\n\nI asked him if we could speak only German twice a week for 10 minutes (with a timer both times). Is that too much? I of course also learn German in the meantime, but should I decrease it to one time per week so that I can make more progress between the times when we do have to speak?  \n\n\nThe reason that I'm asking is because, even though he's nice, I can see him becoming impatient when I can't find my words. I think it's a bit frustrating for him haha :)   \n\n\nDo you have any tips? I am currently A2 in speaking, but can understand most things from the B1 level.",

People who replied to the tweet were debating the origin of the video, and someone mentioned: ‚Äúthey were speaking Chinese but with very strong Taiwanese accent.‚Äù\n\nIt all sounded Chinese to me. ü§∑\n\n\nI think of accents as being the same word/words in a language that are pronounced different due to the region. So for example, some people from Texas call it Teh-zuuus (country accent from old western movie lol) while the rest of us just pronounce it Tex-zis.  Tey-has as the South Americans pronounce isn‚Äôt relevant to my question, I know that‚Äôs different. Another example would be people in New Jersey and New York pronouncing mother as ‚Äúmuva‚Äù. \n\nRegardless of the accent, the word is still the same thing. It just sounds odd.\n\nIn other languages like Chinese, what exactly is a ‚ÄúTaiwanese‚Äù accent? Does it work just like the ones in America? I literally can‚Äôt tell the difference. lol\n\nhere the link to tweet for reference: https://twitter.com/telegra2116/status/1628024581607895042?s=20\n\nvideo the tweet replied to: https://twitter.com/infussambas/status/1619699125146222593?s=20\n\nThanks for any clarification.",

I'm pretty sure I don't have a personality that enjoys learning multiple languages, but I consider it a failing to know only one language.  I can't concisely say why Chinese, so I'll just leave it at that.\n\nI am currently in school for a business degree and the state university system requires 6 credits of a foreign language.  So far, I have taken all of my courses within my state's community college system due to cost, scheduling convenience, and location convenience.  Ideally, I would take Chinese at one of the community colleges, but they only offer Spanish.  The university offers Chinese, which is why I defaulted to taking the language requirement at the university when the time comes.\n\nHowever, I've recently wondered about the worth of college language courses if my goal is to learn a language for conversational fluency purposes.  If cost and convenience remain important to me and college courses are not very effective, then maybe I should just take Spanish instead of Chinese to fulfill the degree requirement.  If college is effective, then of course I will go with my original plan.  If it matters, I see nothing on the horizon that would give me opportunities to practice Chinese after the courses are complete.",

Wanna know how would others think because it keeps bothering me.   \n\n\nFirstly, I want to mention my language/culture background in brief.\n\n*  My Mother tongue: Mandarin(Taiwanese) \n* 1st foreign language : English  (since high school). \n* 2nd foreign language: French  (few years ago , got DELF B2 and lived in Paris for awhile)\n\nThe scenario :\n\n* I'm having course (not language course) in US. Most of classmates are not native english speakers. \n* The teacher likes to get the attention from the only french student of class by asking how to pronounce some words in french. In the beginning, I feel it's no big deal.\n* But the teacher keeps doing this almost every time, and the particular word is so unnecessary to the course. Its quite annoying probably because he keeps using american way (like this [https://www.instagram.com/p/CpiS2hQtlHD/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpiS2hQtlHD/)  XD) to pronounce french word without any improvement, just for his own fun.\n\nThe issue :\n\n* I just feel my favorite language is being sabotaged. Especially it reminds me that it took lots of efforts on practicing french pronunciation to reach certain level ( clear, fluent but native speaker can notice).      \n* But Why should I care? I'm not even french, neither speaking french regularly now.\n* Maybe it's hard to have certain level of culture awareness for monolingual person?\n\nThanks everyone, I know this article is not about learning. Just feel language learners have more awareness about other language/culture. Have a great nice day no matter where you are and what you are going to learn :D",

So at this point with this information some might consider me \"fluent\". However, I still struggle a lot in understanding people when listening and with expressing myself accurately and naturally.\n\nI hate when people consider being fluent as knowing a certain amount of words and mastering grammar, because guess what, I already reached that but I'm nowhere near fluency. I consider fluency as interacting with people/ reading, etc. with almost no issues at all and using the appropriate words in their situations like a native would.\n\nThat is not the case at all for me, I struggle with understanding what I listen to and can't hold a proper conversation with a native because I usually miss half of what they say and because I can't precisely say what I mean. \n\nI am not a native English speaker but I consider myself fluent in English as i have 0 issues using the language, but that's nowhere near the case in german. So I'm tired of people saying just learn grammar and words because that's not how it works, you should be able to naturally use the language in your day to day life with no issues. \n\nNow the thing is I still have no idea how to adopt that and I'm certain no amount of language learning books or lessons can get you to that level, so am I supposed to just keep using the language intensively until I one day get fluent?? There seems to be no concrete answer on how to actually reach fluency after you \"get a c1 certificate\".",

I studied Korean for a few months before I decided I wanted to learn Chinese, and I paused my Korean studies to start studying Chinese. I study Chinese for a few months. After a few months of Chinese, I stopped studying to finish studying for school so I could graduate (and I did). But now that I'm graduated and unemployed (for now, looking for a job lol), I seem to have a lot of spare time to study languages. The problem is, I can speak a small amount in both languages, I just don't have any resources to get me started again with these two languages, and my motivation is really going down, and I feel like I won't be able to learn the languages I want to learn, and it's a downer. Do you have any tips for when you are feeling unmotivated to study? What do you do?  \n\n\nAlso, if you happen to be studying the same languages as me, do you have any resource recommendations?

        "text": "So I'm a native English speaker. Urdu is also my mother tongue, but I have a love-hate relationship with it and always struggled. I've lived in Pakistan all my life except for 2 years in the US, so I know enough to get by. Obviously everyone around me speaks in Urdu, I watch the news in Urdu, and I listen to music in Urdu. What I mean to say is that I don't actively work on Urdu because the last time I read or wrote something in Urdu was more than **10** years ago. Other than that, it's all passive listening. \n\nBut, this year, I decided I wanted to change that because I'm sick of people thinking I was raised abroad because I wasn't. I just watched and read way too much English content growing up. So I started reading a short story/essay collection by Ismat Chughtai because I'd heard good things about her.\n\nAnd I can read it. She's not using simple Urdu by any means, but I can still read it. Even parts where I don't know the vocabulary, I can guess what she's trying to say. I'm still struggling, but I understand idiomatic phrases, words, and sentence structures that I didn't know I even knew. For comparison, I'm also reading the Claire de Lune short story collection by Guy de Maupassant and I'm **struggling**. Like I can read it, but it's infinitely harder than Ismat Chughtai. \n\nSo yeah, immersion is no joke. \n\nAlso, multilingual kids who have a love-hate relationship with their mother tongue, give it a shot. It's your culture and your history. Own it. (Unless you have traumas associated with it, in which case do whatever you're comfortable with)",

But I still can't picture myself understanding and talking in Greek.\n\nWhen I do feel like I'm doing well I try to use it to understand outside of a classroom/learning setting and I just drown.\n\nBoth my in-laws have passed away now and I feel like I failed, and that I was doomed to fail anyway. \n\nAre there any mental exercises I can do to make me envision using Greek, of believing I can?

Also feel like my brain and my eyes are uncoordinated: most of the time my eyes go slower than my brain can process the words, and when I try to correct it, the opposite happens.\n\nAlso, my reading comprehension has been really bad. I'm having a hard time understanding the message from the text, as all my focus is in struggling to read as efficiently as I was used to.\n\nSomething that has helped me to read better in english, is reading out loud.\n\n**Has anyone been in a situation like this?

However, I have still have yet to have a pleasant experience with Germans in general. I‚Äôve visited the country multiple times, and have even used bumble to try and make connections. I‚Äôve been losing motivation to learn German because most if not all of my interactions have been with Germans either constantly criticizing my home country (which yeah it has problems but I‚Äôd rather that not be the topic of conversation every day), or just so argumentative. For example I‚Äôll say how much I love cafes in Berlin, and then I‚Äôll get told ‚ÄúCafes aren‚Äôt a Berlin thing‚Äù or how Berlin isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúGermany‚Äù. If I bring up cooking, I‚Äôll get told how I don‚Äôt know how to make real food because I‚Äôm from the US. I‚Äôm tired of all the jabs people seem to try and take. On the other hand, I find my experiences in France to be much better. Baristas and servers have offered to help, or seem excited when I speak to them in French, and many French people I‚Äôve talked to seem to laugh and smile, and be less serious. I know these are just cultural differences, and I‚Äôm not saying Germans are bad people at all, just that I feel my personality does not match at all. Now my issue is that I just don‚Äôt have the same passion for French. I think it‚Äôs a nice language and beautiful country, but I don‚Äôt get the same excitement I used to get when learning it or listening to French music. Does anyone else have this issue? Sorry I‚Äôm advance if I‚Äôve offended anyone, that‚Äôs not my intention. This is just my experience and how I feel.",
