It turns out that changing the height also changed the width, but changing the width did not change the height. Reversing the order, the opposite was true. \n\nSo that means that it keeps track of which have been set, and setting the width does something different based on whether the height has already been set.

        "author": "overkill",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/8k6pse/paging_sql_queries_for_great_good/",
        "text": "I posted a code snippet in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/programminghorror/comments/8jitdi/this_is_production_code_at_the_company_i_work_for/dz12hms/) from my time as Dev Manager wrangling an offshore team. I have nothing against offshore teams btw, just this offshore team. They produced some absolute howlers, which I picked up on my code reviews. I was eventually asked not to review their code any more, because pointing out the Lovecraftian horrors they were creating was counter-productive and was impacting the delivery schedule.\n\nThey had issues with SQL. There was a speed issue. They decided to sprinkle NOLOCK hints over every query in the code base. This was unacceptable (multi-user system, transactional integrity required, yada yada yada). That got shut down after a couple of **months** of patient explaining why reading dirty transactions should be considered a sin within this application. The queries, were still slow however, so, having heard about Parallelisation, they implemented it!\n\nEvery select query was run through this:\n     \n    var reqs = request.PagedQuery.Count();\n    var rows = new Dictionary&lt;int, IEnumerable&lt;DataRow&gt;&gt;();\n    Parallel.For(\n        0, \n        reqs, \n        (i) =&gt;\n        {\n            var result = database.ExecuteDataSet(CommandType.Text, request.PagedQuery[i]);\n            rows.Add(i, result.Tables[0].AsEnumerable());\n        }\n    );\n    DataSet da = new DataSet(); \n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; rows.Count; i++)\n    {\n        var dataRows = rows[i].ToList();\n        da.Merge(dataRows.ToArray());\n    }\n\nThe astute amongst you will notice a couple of things. The `PagedQuery` object I will get back to, because you absolutely want to see it, but in essence it is a list of SQL queries. The `Parallel.For(...` call stands out, surely this will make things faster by running multiple queries at the same time! Sadly, the `database.ExecuteDataSet(...)` call is made on an SQL connection which can only run a single query at a time, blocking subsequent calls and increasing the overall amount of time needed to execute the query because of locking contention. The results are then merged together afterwards, increasing the overall time again. WIN.\n\nBut the `PagedQuery` will make your skin crawl. All select queries were executed by calling a `GetData` function and passing in a table name, a comma delimited set of column names, a where clause, a single field to order the results by, and whether that was ASC or DESC. This `GetData` function then started innocently enough by calling:\n\n    String.Format( SearchSqlQuery, columns, table)\n\n`SearchSqlQuery` was this:\n    \n    public const string SearchSqlQuery = \"DECLARE @PageSize{{5}} INT, @PageNumber{{5}} INT; \"\n        + \"SELECT  @PageSize{{5}} = {{0}}, @PageNumber{{5}} = {{1}}; \"\n        + \"DECLARE @RowStart{{5}} INT, @RowEnd{{5}} INT, @Remainder INT; \"\n        + \"SET @PageNumber{{5}} = @PageNumber{{5}} - 1; \"\n        + \"SET @RowStart{{5}} = (@PageSize{{5}} * @PageNumber{{5}})+1; \"\n        + \"SET @Remainder = {{6}};\"\n        + \"SET @RowEnd{{5}} = (@RowStart{{5}} + @PageSize{{5}} + @Remainder)-1; \"\n        + \"WITH RowData{{5}} AS \"\n        + \"(SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY {{2}} {{3}}) AS RowId, {0} FROM [dbo].[{1}] {{4}})\"\n        + \"SELECT * FROM RowData{{5}} WHERE RowId BETWEEN @RowStart{{5}} AND @RowEnd{{5}};\";\n\nNow that you've cleaned the vomit off of your keyboard, let's break this down a bit. First, the `-1`s and `+1`s are there because arrays start at 1, as everyone knows, except the C# language. And all other languages except VBA if you switch an option on.\n\nThe `{0} FROM [dbo].[{1}]` will evaluate to `select columns from [dbo].[tablename]` Fine. The resultant string is then re-`Formatted` in a loop with parameters: \n\n* Rows Per Page (an application setting), \n* Page number wanted (loop counter), \n* order by field, \n* ASC/DESC,\n* where clause/group by clause/anything after the tablename you wanted to execute, \n* an integer to name the variables for some reason, \n* a calculated remainder for last page which was essentially (rows in table) mod (Rows Per Page) and only added to the last loop\n\nBut wait, rows in table??? How did they know how many rows there were in the table? How did they know how many times to run through the loop? Because before they generated the query they did a `select count(*) from table` with the where clause, then cached that for 1 second (arbitrarily) while they built the query, then executed it in the `Parallel.For` that this started with. So not only was the query now slower through their optimisation techniques, it would miss out the last few rows in the event that someone in this multi-user system created a new row in the table. I assume, but never saw, that if someone deleted a row there would be an SQL error somewhere as they tried to select the n+1^th row\n\nOnce I've recovered from the horror of writing this, which will probably take a few days and some gin, I'll post another one of the fucking atrocious ideas they had: The MemoryManager class.",
