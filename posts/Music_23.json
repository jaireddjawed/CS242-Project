        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/11pxtuj/mysterious_deleted_song_and_spotify_playlist/",
        "text": "So there was a song that I really liked called  \"Talk about my ways\" by an artist called Dajatsun on an album called Halftone. A few days ago the song was available on Spotify as well as on YouTube, but today I went to listen and the song was unplayable on Spotify and the YouTube video was taken down. After doing a bit of digging I discovered that the artist herself, Dajatsun, had deleted all of her songs for the album. It was really puzzling, I looked at her profile and sure enough all the songs were unplayable but still showed up as once having been there. Here's my dilemma. I really loved that song, Talk About My Ways, as the melody was very summer-esque and it was nostalgic because it reminded me of similar guitar riffs I had heard before. Now I've been trying to search for her and her other work but apparently everything she's made was deleted abruptly, and since she's not a well known, if known at all, artist it's really hard to try to find this song on Google or YouTube. Let alone the artist itself. So if there's music people out there who could in any way help me contact her or to find that song I would really appreciate it, as it's really hard to find these Indie music composers through conventional means. I would just like to figure out why the song was taken down and if there's any chance she'll re- release it.",

Rarely do we see an artist these days top the studio recording in a live performance (no lip syncing) but tonight she nailed it.
